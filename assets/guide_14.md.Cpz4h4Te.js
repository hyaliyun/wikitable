It aired on CBS from March 22, 1980 to May 17, 1980, and from September 20, 1980 to March 7, 1981.McNeil, Alex, Total Television: The Comprehensive Guide to Programming From 1948 to the Present, New York: Penguin Books, 1996, pp. 839-840.Brooks, Tim, and Earle Marsh, The Complete Directory to Prime-Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present, Sixth Edition, New York: Ballantine Books, 1995, , pp. 1042-1043. The show should not be confused with the spring 1970 sitcom also called The Tim Conway Show or with The Tim Conway Comedy Hour, a comedy-variety series which aired in the fall of the same year, both also on CBS. Regulars *Tim Conway *Eric Boardman (1980) *Jack Riley (1980) *Maggie Roswell *Miriam Flynn *Dick Orkin (1980-1981) *Bert Berdis (1980-1981) *Harvey Korman (1981) *The Peter Matz Orchestra *The Don Crichton Dancers *The Artie Malvin Singers Production Despite his success as a member of the cast of the situation comedy McHale's Navy from 1962 to 1966 and in two 1964 theatrical films spun off from the series, McHale's Navy and McHale's Navy Joins the Air Force, as well as his popularity during several years as a regular on The Carol Burnett Show in the 1970s, Tim Conway had found no success starring in a television show of his own. His situation comedies Rango in 1967 and The Tim Conway Show in the spring of 1970, as well as a fall 1970 comedy-variety series, The Tim Conway Comedy Hour, had all been cancelled after short runs. In March 1980, Conway made yet another attempt at a show of his own with a second comedy-variety series entitled - like his 1970 situation comedy - The Tim Conway Show. The series was produced by Carol Burnetts husband, Joe Hamilton, and, not surprisingly, closely followed the format of The Carol Burnett Show - a small group of regulars performing comedy sketches, interspersed with musical numbers, and supplemented by occasional guest stars - in which Conway had thrived for several years. His Carol Burnett Show co- stars Carol Burnett, Vicki Lawrence, and Harvey Korman all made guest appearances, and the orchestra, The Peter Matz Orchestra, was the same one that had performed on The Carol Burnett Show from 1971 to 1978.Brooks and Marsh, p. 167. Unusually, the shows regular dance troupe, The Don Crichton Dancers, was composed entirely of children between the ages of 8 and 13. Another portion of the show featured Tim recruiting members of the audience to join him onstage and perform sketches with him. The Tim Conway Show premiered in a one-hour format on March 22, 1980, but ratings were disappointing, and it left the air after the broadcast of May 17, 1980. Regulars Eric Boardman and Jack Riley left the show. When it returned on September 20, 1980, it had been reduced to 30 minutes in length. Ratings remained low, and in early 1981 Bert Berdis and Dick Orkin were dropped from the cast and Harvey Korman, with whom Conway had enjoyed an excellent comedic chemistry during sketches together on The Carol Burnett Show, joined the program as a regular. Kormans arrival, however, did not save The Tim Conway Show, which soon was cancelled. Its last new episode aired on March 7, 1981. The Tim Conway Show appeared on CBS throughout its run. During its initial March–May 1980 run as a one-hour program, it aired at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday. When it returned in its new 30-minute format in September 1980, it aired at 8:00 p.m. Saturday, moving to 8:30 p.m. Saturday in November 1980, where it remained until the end of its run in March 1981. In June 1981, CBS began broadcasting reruns of 30-minute episodes at 8:30 p.m. on Monday; these continued until August 31, 1981, when the show left the air for good. Despite its failure in the ratings, The Tim Conway Show would prove to be the longest-lived of the shows featuring Conway as their star. He would return to television in 1983 in the situation comedy Ace Crawford, Private Eye, but it was destined to last only a month.

E. Powell, 1992, is a print database of accepted standardized abbreviations used for citing the author who validly published the name of a taxon. The database is now maintained online at the International Plant Names Index. The book provides recommended abbreviations for authors' names that help to distinguish authors with the same surname when giving the full name of a taxon. It deals authors who validly published the name of a flowering plant, gymnosperm, fern, bryophyte, algae, fungi or fossil plants. Prior to its publication in 1992, many abbreviations for authors to be cited could be found in Taxonomic literature.

The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) governs the naming of these organisms, and suggests that a taxon be fully identified by its name and the author, but does not require that abbreviations be used when citing an author for a taxon. When abbreviations are used, the ICN recommends that Brummitt & Powell's Authors of plant names (1992), and the websites, the International Plant Names Index (www.ipni.org) and the Index Fungorum (www.indexfungorum.org) can be used to find \\"unambiguous\\" abbreviations. Brummitt & Powell may not be international in scope, and it may be missing abbreviations for authors who validly published taxa during some time spans.

The impending arrival of strikebreakers from Sydney resulted in the calling off of the strike and abandonment of the dispute about a central pick-up.Robert Bollard, Victorian workers in the 1917 Mass Strike Australian National University The notorious 'Flinders Street Extension murder' in 1947 was indicative of the violence of the docks in the mid 20th century.

Following the formation of the Melbourne Harbour Trust in 1876, Sir John Coode was engaged to develop a scheme to improve Melbourne's Port. Along with the creation of the Coode Canal and Victoria Dock, the plan emphasised the need for a main road linking the river wharves.

It is also known as Korean hemorrhagic fever and epidemic hemorrhagic fever. The species that cause HFRS include Hantaan orthohantavirus, Dobrava-Belgrade orthohantavirus, Saaremaa virus, Seoul orthohantavirus, Puumala orthohantavirus and other orthohantaviruses. It is found in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Of these species, Hantaan River virus and Dobrava-Belgrade virus cause the most severe form of the syndrome and have the highest morbidity rates. When caused by the Puumala virus, it is also called nephropathia epidemica. This infection is known as sorkfeber in Swedish and myyräkuume in Finnish (vole fever). In Norway, it is called musepest (mouse plague). Both hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) appear to be immunopathologic, and inflammatory mediators are important in causing the clinical manifestations.  Signs and symptoms  Symptoms of HFRS usually develop within 1 to 2 weeks after exposure to infectious material, but in rare cases, they may take up to 8 weeks to develop. In Nephropathia epidemica, the incubation period is three weeks. Initial symptoms begin suddenly and include intense headaches, back and abdominal pain, fever, chills, nausea, and blurred vision. Individuals may have flushing of the face, inflammation or redness of the eyes, or a rash. Later symptoms can include low blood pressure, acute shock, vascular leakage, and acute kidney failure, which can cause severe fluid overload. The severity of the disease varies depending upon the virus causing the infection. Hantaan and Dobrava virus infections usually cause severe symptoms, while Seoul, Saaremaa, and Puumala virus infections are usually more moderate. Complete recovery can take weeks or months. The course of the illness can be split into five phases: ;Febrile phase:Symptoms include redness of cheeks and nose, fever, chills, sweaty palms, diarrhea, malaise, headaches, nausea, abdominal and back pain, respiratory problems such as the ones common in the influenza virus, as well as gastro-intestinal problems. These symptoms normally occur for three to seven days and arise about two to three weeks after exposure. ;Hypotensive phase: This occurs when the blood platelet levels drop and symptoms can lead to tachycardia and hypoxemia. This phase can last for 2 days. ;Oliguric phase: This phase lasts for three to seven days and is characterised by the onset of renal failure and proteinuria. ;Diuretic phase: This is characterized by diuresis of three to six litres per day, which can last for a couple of days up to weeks. ;Convalescent phase: This is normally when recovery occurs and symptoms begin to improve. This syndrome can also be fatal. In some cases, it has been known to cause permanent renal failure.  Transmission  Transmission by aerosolized rodent excreta still remains the only known way the virus is transmitted to humans. In general, droplet and/or fomite transfer has not been shown in the hantaviruses in either the pulmonary or hemorrhagic forms. For Nephropathia epidemica, the bank vole is the reservoir for the virus, which humans contract through inhalation of aerosolised vole droppings.  Diagnosis  HFRS is difficult to diagnose on clinical grounds alone and serological evidence is often needed. A fourfold rise in IgG antibody titer in a 1-week interval and the presence of the IgM type of antibodies against hantaviruses are good evidence for an acute hantavirus infection. HFRS should be suspected in patients with acute febrile flu-like illness, kidney failure of unknown origin and sometimes liver dysfunction.  Treatment  There is no cure or vaccine for HFRS. Treatment involves supportive therapy including renal dialysis. Treatment with ribavirin in China and Korea, administered within 7 days of onset of fever, resulted in a reduced mortality as well as shortened course of illness.  Prevention  Rodent control in and around the home remains the primary prevention strategy, as well as eliminating contact with rodents in the workplace and campsite. Closed storage sheds and cabins are often ideal sites for rodent infestations. Airing out of such spaces prior to use is recommended. Avoid direct contact with rodent droppings and wear a mask to avoid inhalation of aerosolized rodent secretions.  Epidemiology  HFRS is primarily a Eurasian disease, whereas HPS appears to be confined to the Americas. The geography is directly related to the indigenous rodent hosts and the viruses that coevolved with them. Although fatal in a small percentage of cases, nephropathia epidemica is generally milder than the HFRS that is caused by hantaviruses in other parts of the world.

It is situated on Main Street, a kilometre west of the town’s Post Office, on land originally owned by Reverend W.H. Walton of the Primitive Methodist Church.  History  Baby John Lancaster was Penguin’s first death, in 1865, four years after European settlement. The first recorded burial was that of Eliza Ann Hales. She was buried in the cemetery on 23 January 1869. Her grave is marked with a headstone. The most complete and up-to-date burial records as well as a detailed plot burial map are available on Council's website. A community meeting on 28 January 1885 established the Penguin Cemetery Trust. Twelve years and many burials later, the site was gazetted as a public cemetery, known then as the Penguin Public Cemetery. The first meeting of the Trust committee was held on 6 January 1886; the last recorded meeting on 24 June 1943. Meeting minutes indicate that in its earlier days the cemetery was portioned off according to religious denomination, however this is not evident today. Minutes also indicate additional lands were purchased as demand grew. In 1957 the cemetery opened its new section, essentially delineating the old from the new. The cemetery closed in 1977 when the nearby Penguin/Ulverstone Lawn Cemetery opened on South Road. A few burials still take place in the Penguin Cemetery.  Heritage-listing  Penguin's colourful heritage Penguin General Cemetery was heritage-listed in 2007 under Tasmania’s Historic Cultural Heritage Act 1995, for its evolutionary pattern of Penguin life, its research potential, community significance, and associations with Tasmanian history. At rest here are Bounty immigrants of the 1850s, returned soldiers from the Boer, First and Second World Wars, many of the town’s most notable former residents, as well as former convicts (pictured).  Penguin History Group  Updated Penguin General Cemetery plot burial informationThe Penguin History Group has played a role in the cemetery’s recent history. Checking the cemetery map with the records and headstones began in 1994. This information was compiled by the Penguin History Group and published in 2003 in the Penguin Cemetery Old and New Sections. In 2002 members of the Penguin History Group, with materials donated by Central Coast Council, installed the onsite map and its shelter. A Bi-Centenary grant in 2004 of $3,500 enabled erection of entry gateposts and plot marker plaques.  Recent Research  Penguin’s 1915 mystery ‘John Doe’ 2006 saw renewed interest in the cemetery, sparked essentially by the chance discovery of a 1915 ‘John Doe’ burial in the records. Buried at the back edge of the cemetery, side-by-side with six other pioneers buried by the state, the discovery generated community interest, which resulted in researching the seven burials and erecting individual gravestones for each. Research suggests the mystery person may have been Jeremiah or Michael Clifford, an Irishman in his 40s. The most comprehensive account of the circumstance of his death comes from the statewide newspaper: The Mercury, under the heading “A bush tragedy – Dead Body Of Man Found – Gunshot Wound To The Head – Supposed Case Of Suicide”. The case for his presumed identity rests on the Police Gazette records. The remains are still unidentified. Much is already published on Penguin’s heritage-listed cemetery. This has generated investment in showcasing it as a tourist magnet, including a dedicated small internal garden in memory of the tens of unnamed babies buried in the old section. Such has been the response to the cemetery's ongoing and widespread publicity that the Tasmanian Association for Hospice & Palliative Care (TAH&PC;) funded the inaugural Penguin Twilight Celebration of the Dead - music among the tombstones. This unusual, even unique, event held on Wednesday 7 January 2015 at 7pm in the cemetery was well supported by the broader Penguin community. It marked the centenary of the cemetery's unknown burial. The one-hour musical extravaganza, involving pipers, vocalists, choir, violinist, flautist and guitarist had the crowd of 120-150 people meandering around six of the more significant tombstones. The celebration culminated in the magnificent and moving butterfly release in the commemorative garden dedicated to the tens of unnamed babies in the cemetery. Photographic images of all headstones are available online at the Australian Cemeteries Index. Most recently, the Penguin community organized an onsite fundraiser to preserve the cemetery's history. The fundraiser was a Long Table dinner within the cemetery grounds, another truly unique experience, and once again bringing the cemetery alive. Attended by 36 guests the monies raised go towards commissioning an art-piece in the commemorative garden for the 80 or so unnamed babies buried in the grounds. Penguin's leadership in novel uses for old cemeteries is being emulated across Australia. Most recently the Penguin community dedicated a sculpture to its many unnamed children buried in the cemetery.

The island has an area of 4.07 km2 in area and was inhabited to 1970. Geography Location of Gaja Island in the Tokara Islands Gajajima is located west of Nakanoshima. The island is volcanic in origin, although no volcanic activity has occurred in historic times and no comprehensive geological survey has been performed. The irregularly-shaped island has an area of approximately with a length of about and a width of . The coastline is surrounded by cliffs of up to 100 meters in height, making landing impossible except for one location in the south. The highest elevation on the island is above sea level. Its climate is classified as subtropical, with a rainy season from May through September. History Per local folklore, the island was one of the havens of the defeated Heike clan after they lost the Genpei War against the Minamoto clan. It came under the control of the Shimazu clan from 1434. In 1450, the island was invaded by the Ryukyu Kingdom, and was the northernmost expansion of that country.Turnbull, Stephen. The Samurai Capture a King: Okinawa 1609. Osprey Publishing, 2009. Pp 9. During the Edo period, Takarajima was part of Satsuma Domain and was administered as part of Kawabe District. In 1896, the island was transferred to the administrative control of Ōshima District, Kagoshima, and from 1911 was part of the village of Toshima, Kagoshima. A lighthouse was completed in 1940, and the population at that time was 133. The village had an elementary school, and its own ship for connection to the mainland and other islands. From 1946 to 1952, the island was administered by the United States as part of the Provisional Government of Northern Ryukyu Islands. A junior high school was built in 1948, power plant and water treatment plant in 1961 and telephone system in 1966. The population was economically supported by commercial fishing for bonito. However, the island was repeatedly devastated by typhoons, especially in 1945, 1951, 1956, and 1957 leading to plans to relocate the population to either Amami Ōshima or mainland Kagoshima Prefecture. Collapse of the bonito fisheries for unknown reasons financially ruined the islanders and led to near famine conditions, causing many islanders to leave. A decision was reached by the government to relocate the remaining seven households with a total of 28 people to Kagoshima in January 1970. At the time of the evacuation on 28 July 1970, only 4 households with 16 people were remaining. However, even after the evacuation of the inhabitants, the lighthouse remained manned until April 1982. Although landing is not permitted to the general public, the abandoned buildings have been looted, and in 1996 the Japanese government discovered that a party of six Chinese had illegally landed on the island and were attempting to establish residence. Groups of former island residents have visited the island in 2001 and 2010 to take care of their ancestral graves.

He was the only son of King Teimuraz I of Kakheti to have survived into adulthood. He fathered the future King Heraclius I of Kakheti, who continued the royal line of the Kakhetian Bagrationi. From 1627 until his death in battle with the pro-Persian Georgian ruler Rostom of Kartli, he held sway over the fief of Mukhrani, whose princely rulers had been dispossessed by Teimuraz I.  Early life  David was born around 1612 into the family of Teimuraz I, the king of the eastern Georgian kingdom of Kakheti, and his second wife Khorashan, a sister of the neighboring Georgian monarch, Luarsab II of Kartli. He was the youngest of Teimuraz's sons and the king's only male offspring to have survived into adulthood. David's two elder half-brothers died in captivity in Persia, castrated at the order of the Persian shah Abbas I, who fought a devastating war against Kakheti in order to bend Teimuraz I into submission. David emerged in the political life of eastern Georgia in 1627, when he was bestowed with the princedom of Mukhrani, the fief of Kaikhosro, Prince of Mukhrani, a disgraced nobleman of Kartli, who had been forced to seek refuge in the Ottoman Empire alongside with Teimuraz's domestic arch- rival, Giorgi Saakadze.  Later years and death  In 1633, Teimuraz was overthrown by the seasoned Muslim Georgian prince Rostom Khan, who had come to conquer Kartli and Kakheti at the head of a Persian army. David was able, for the time being, to retain his hold of Mukhrani, and endeavored to meet Rostom for negotiations at Surami, but he suspected treachery and quickly withdrew to his estate. Rostom's attempts to win him over went in vain and David rallied to his father's cause as Teimuraz, having resumed his reign in Kakheti in 1638, marched with the Kakhetian army to dislodge Rostom from Kartli in 1648. Having taken command of his father's troops, David was attacked and defeated by Rostom's Persian auxiliaries at Magharo. David himself was killed in battle at the hand of the Kazakh officer Jamal Khan. David's severed head was delivered to Rostom. Teimuraz lost the crown of Kakheti at once. Through Rostom's magnanimity, he was able to retire to his in-laws in the western Georgian kingdom of Imereti and also have his last son, David, buried at the cathedral of St. George of Alaverdi. Mukhrani was restored to a member of its earlier princely family, Vakhtang II.  Family  David married, in 1628, Princess Elene (died December 1695), former wife of Duke David of Aragvi and daughter of Prince Levan Diasamidze, who was a brother of the catholicos Eudemus I. After David's death, Elene followed her father-in-law in his Muscovite exile, bringing the son Nikoloz with her in 1653. She died in Georgia and was buried at the Alaverdi cathedral in Kakheti. The couple had four sons and two daughters: * Prince Luarsab (died 1659). * Prince Giorgi (died 1651); he was adopted and designated as heir apparent by his aunt's husband, King Alexander III of Imereti, in 1649, but the arrangement was disrupted by Giorgi's sudden death. * Prince Nikoloz (Erekle) (1643 – 1709), the future king of Kakheti and Kartli under the name of Heraclius I or Nazar Ali Khan. * Prince Ioseb (died 1648); he was affianced in 1646 to a sister of Tsar Alexis of Russia. * Princess Anastasia * Princess Ketevan (1648 – 16 April 1719); she was married, successively, to King Bagrat V of Imereti (1660–1661), Prince Gogoberidze, and thirdly, to Archil, King of Kakheti and Imereti (22 March 1668 – 1698).

Early life and studies  Robert Chrisman was born on May 28, 1937, in Yuma, Arizona, and raised near Nogales, Arizona. His parents had moved to Arizona from Chicago. Chrisman's father Alfred was an auto mechanic. His mother, Thelma Allimono, was a homemaker and later in life became a teacher. She was a daughter of W.D. Allimono, the first African-American certified public accountant. In the 1950s Chrisman's family moved to the Bay Area. He quickly became involved in the diverse San Francisco cultural scene. He studied literature in UC Berkeley's English department, under the mentorship of Josephine Miles. Independently Chrisman discovered the works of Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. Du Bois, Langston Hughes, Richard Wright, Robert Hayden, James Baldwin, Lorraine Hansberry, Vladimir Lenin, Karl Marx, Che Guevara, Pablo Neruda, Mao Tse-tung, and the Beat Generation writers.Allen, Robert. \\"TBS: A Celebration of the First Forty Years\\", UC Berkeley. November 19, 2009. Chrisman graduated from UC Berkeley in 1958 with a BA in English Literature and a minor in Philosophy. In 1960 he obtained an MA in English Language Arts from San Francisco State University. Among his instructors at SF State were Herbert Blau, Mark Linenthal and James Schevill. Chrisman's MA thesis was a collection of poems that became the nucleus for his first book of poetry, Children of Empire (1981). Chrisman edited the college literary magazine, Transfer. His poem \\"Swan Lake\\", inspired by his then wife Gale Chrisman, received a Borestone Mountain Poetry Award and was published in its 15th annual issue, Best Poems of 1962 (1963).Best Poems of 1962. Borestone Mountain Poetry Awards. Vol XV. Palo Alto: Pacific Books, 1963. Print. He obtained a PhD in English from the University of Michigan; his dissertation was a study of the Afro-modernist poet Robert Hayden.  The Black Scholar  In November 1969, Robert Chrisman co-founded The Black Scholar (TBS) with Nathan Hare and Allan Ross, a white printer and activist. The launching of TBS followed in the wake of the 1968 historic strike at San Francisco State University, which involved thousands of students and faculty, including Chrisman and Hare, in a prolonged and sometimes violent struggle with the administration and the state. The strike, one of the longest of its kind in the US,Biga, Leo Adam. \\"Letting 1,000 Flowers Bloom: Robert Chrisman and the Mission of The Black Scholar.\\" The Black Scholar. 36.2–3. Print. lasted for five months and grew out of frustrations of black students and instructors who wanted the university to establish an independent Black Studies department. These demands were eventually won but Chrisman paid a high price for the victory; he and Nathan Hare were fired from their teaching positions. Chrisman was reinstated but not in a tenure-track position. Disappointed with the way in which black struggles were being represented by the mainstream media, Chrisman, Hare, and Ross concluded an independent journal was needed.Chrisman, Robert. The Black Scholar 41.4 (Winter 2011): 2–4. Print. They determined to create an interdisciplinary journal to unite black street activists and academic intellectuals in common advocacy for the needs of the black community. Although TBS was inspired by the Black Power and black student movements of the decade, it did not identify with a particular party. Chrisman has said that he and Hare felt that \\"...blacks were a pre-party state, for the various ideologies and groups that comprised the black movement had not forged a consensus or unity.\\" Chrisman stated: \\"From the start, we believed every contributor should have her own style. We felt the black studies and new black power movement was yet to build its own language, its own terminology, its own style. So, we said, 'let a thousand flowers bloom. Let's have a lot of different styles.'\\" In regards to Chrisman's impact, Robert L. Allen, the long-term Senior Editor of TBS and close friend of Chrisman, stated, > I know of no one who has worked harder than Robert Chrisman to actualize an > intellectual vision. In building TBS he demonstrated the power of the > principles of self-determination and self-reliance. He built the journal not > by relying on grants and funding from foundations and government agencies, > but by relying on the people we serve – teachers, students, community > activists, labor activists, writers and artists, librarians, academicians, > and just plain working people – our subscribers. These folks have shown that > they have the power to sustain an intellectual enterprise and keep it > independent. Chrisman believed that by relying on community support TBS > could be self determining. For over forty years Robert Chrisman's strategic > vision enabled TBS to make a path where there was none before.  Career in academia  In addition to his writing and editing, Chrisman maintained a long career in academia. He taught a variety of courses in literature, creative writing, cultural studies, and black studies at institutions that include the University of Hawaii, Honolulu, University of San Francisco, University of Michigan, Williams College, UC Berkeley, University of Vermont, and Wayne State University. In 2005 he retired as Professor and Chair of the Black Studies Department at the University of Nebraska at Omaha (UNO). Among the initiatives he developed while at UNO was the creation of an annual Malcolm X Festival in Omaha, the city where Malcolm X was born.  Poetry  Described as \\"a poet worthy of praise and wider recognition\\",Miller, Ethelbert E. \\"Review of Robert Chrisman: Minor Casualties\\", African American Review. 30:1 (1996): 142–143. Chrisman published three volumes of poetry: * The Dirty Wars. San Francisco: The Black Scholar Press, 2012, Print. * Minor Casualties: New and Selected Poems. Detroit: Lotus Press, 1993.

His poems were published in Occident, Transfer, Contact, Plural, Galley Sail Review, Berkeley Review, Callaloo, Wasafiri, South and West, Mexico Quarterly Review, Frisco, The Black Scholar, and elsewhere. Chrisman used poetry as one of the primary forms through which to express his vision. As a poet Chrisman experimented with a broad range of styles and subject matter, while maintaining a modernist poetics characterized by formal rigor and lyrical density. Chrisman often explores the human consequences of empires both ancient and modern, highlighting local and international perspectives (as in \\"Children of Empire\\", CE; \\"Perfectly Normal\\", \\"Goyescas\\", and \\"Joseph\\", MC; \\"The Road to Basra\\" and \\"Leviathan\\", TDW). Of such poems Andrew Salkey wrote: \\"The statement poems are all politically engaged [and] morally committed to anti-imperialist discourse and Third World revolutionary aspirations but mindful of the demands of poetic technique and prosodic practice.\\"Salkey, Andrew. \\"Review of Robert Chrisman: Minor Casualties.\\" World Literature Today, 68:2 (1994): 372–374. US popular culture prompts Chrisman's poetic reflections on the operations of collective fantasy (\\"Carnival II\\", CE; \\"Chaplin\\", TDW). Satire runs across his opus, targeting Afrocentrism (\\"The Wiz\\" and \\"Field Nigguh Blues\\", MC)Woodford, John. \\"Review of Minor Casualties\\", The Black Scholar 24.2. as well as the black bourgeoisie (\\"Lexus Blues\\", TDW).Review of The Dirty Wars.

According to present law, abortion can be performed as an elective procedure until 10 weeks following conception, and in specific circumstances afterwards.https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/abortion/doc/croati1.doc. History Yugoslavia, of which SR Croatia was a part, had legalized the practice in 1952 based on a medical, eugenic or a legal indication. In 1960, a social indication was also allowed. In 1969, a rule that a commission's approval was required for the termination of pregnancies within the first 10 weeks - was rescinded. This series of measures did not reduce the total abortion rate at the time, but maternal morbidity and mortality related to abortion declined significantly. Based on a provision in the 1974 Yugoslav Constitution, on 21 April 1978, the \\"Act concerning the medical measures for materialization of the right to freely decide on the birth of children\\" was passed in SR Croatia. This abortion law was not changed when Croatia achieved independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, although there were proposals by right- wing parties for tightening the conditions for legal abortion. In recent years there is an ongoing debate about right to conscientious objection. Critics say that this rule made abortion hard to obtain in some areas, while the proponents argue that every gynecologist has a constitutional right to refuse performing or taking part in the procedure. In November 2014, Ministry of Health announced it will make abortion available in all public hospitals. In case that all gynecologists declare their conscientious objection (which was the case in 5 public hospitals in 2014), the hospital will have to hire an external associate willing to perform the procedure. In March 2017, the Constitutional Court of Croatia ruled that the current law which allows abortion on request does not violate the constitution.http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/ustavni-sud-u-11-sati-donosi- odluku-o-pobacaju-1153189 However, it instructed the Parliament to make a new law in 2 years time, in which preventive and educational measures will be included, aimed at making abortion exceptional.https://sljeme.usud.hr/usud/praksaw.nsf/7114c25caa361e3ac1257f340032f11e/c12570d30061ce54c12580d100416faf/$FILE/SA%C5%BDETAK%20RJE%C5%A0ENJA%20BR.%20U-I-60-1991%20i%20dr.pdf Procedure Abortions can only be performed by a physician in a hospital with a department of obstetrics or gynaecology, or in another authorized facility. Doctors have the right to conscientious objection. Women under 16 must have parental authorization. Past the first 10 weeks, abortions must be approved by a Commission of First Instance, consisting of a gynaecologist, another physician, and a social worker or registered nurse. The commission can choose to approve the abortion if it is medically necessary to save the woman's life or preserve her health, whether during pregnancy or delivery or after delivery; if the child would likely be born with a serious congenital defect; or when the conception results from a criminal act, including rape and incest. The Commission's decision may be appealed to a Commission of Second Instance, whose decision is final. This procedure does not apply in situations where the woman's life or health is in immediate danger or the abortion has already started. Statistics The number of abortions (and live births) in Croatia between 1960 and 2011. , Croatia had 4.7 abortions per 1000 women of childbearing age, lower than in most European countries. The highest percentage of abortion was recorded in the 1980s. In 1989, 49% of all pregnancies ended with an abortion. During the Croatian War of Independence and after it that percentage fell dramatically and still kept falling in the following years. Conscientious objection accounts for about 70% of physicians according to data from 2006. Right to conscientious objection is granted not only for physicians but also for other medical personnel. In 2015, there were 2992 recorded legal abortions in Croatia, a sharp decline comparing to 14282 recorded in 1995.http://www.jutarnji.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/broj- rodenih-u-2015.-frapirao-i-najvece-pesimiste/4015452/ Public opinion A poll from 2008 showed that 50% of respondents do not approve abortion in the case in which a couple does not want more children. That was increased opposition compared to the same poll from 1999 when only 40% opposed. However, this poll was criticized by some for being suggestive. In 2011, Catholic bishop Valter Župan publicly called for abortion to be banned. In response, Nova TV had an opinion poll conducted, in which 67% of respondents in Croatia said they believe that the current abortion law should not be changed, while 23% supported a ban on abortions. Support for a ban was higher among women, and in the regions Slavonia and Dalmatia. According to another survey in 2013 which was conducted among 1500 young people in Croatia (in the age between 14 and 27), 38.9% of the respondents said it should be legal, 28.7% said only medically warranted abortions should be allowed, 20.0% were unsure, and 12.4% said that abortion should be completely illegal. At the same time, more than half of the respondents did not advocate sexual abstinence. This discrepancy was likely the result of a confusion among the young people caused by the opinions of the Catholic Church and their own sexual needs that arise well before they are ready to enter marriage. A survey from 2014 showed that 18% of respondents 'strongly support' the right to abortion and 16.8% 'tend to support'. In the same time, 24.7% said they were 'strongly opposed' and 14.5% 'tend to oppose'. 24.9% said they were indifferent on the issue. In a Pew Research poll from 2017, 60% of Croatian respondents believed that abortion should be legal in all/most cases, while 37% said it should be illegal in all/most cases.http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp- content/uploads/sites/11/2017/05/09154356/Central-and-Eastern-Europe- Topline_FINAL-FOR-PUBLICATION.pdf In 2020, Ipsos Puls agency conducted a poll in which 81% of respondents agreed with the statement that a woman should have a right to choose regarding pregnancies, giving birth or abortions, of which 68% completely agreed and 13% mostly agreed.https://www.telegram.hr/politika- kriminal/prvi-objavljujemo-vazno-istrazivanje-samo-7-posto-gradana-misli-da- zene-nemaju-pravo-na-izbor-kod-pobacaja/amp/ References Croatia Category:Health in Croatia Croatia ","title":"Abortion in Croatia"},{"id":"39888730","text":"The Rosebud Ranch is a historic ranch on the National Register of Historic Places located near Hood, California, south of Sacramento.

Traditionally one of the nation's busiest for marine transfer operations, notably for crude oil and petroleum products, such as jet fuel and asphalt, it is a port of entry with several facilities within a foreign trade zone. A part of the port is being redeveloped as an adaptable deep water omniport able to handle a variety of bulk and break bulk cargo, as well as shipping containers. The Paulsboro Marine Terminal, as it is known, is owned by the South Jersey Port Corporation and operated by Holt Logistics. The first ship to call at the port, the Doric Warrior, carrying steel for NLMK, arrived March 3, 2017, marking the opening of the new facility. The port could become the site for the production the monopile foundations for turbines for the off-shore wind farm Ocean Wind. Location and access The Port of Paulsboro is one of several in the Delaware Valley metro area and is situated on the east banks of the Delaware River in Gloucester County, New Jersey, across from Philadelphia International Airport. The site of Fort Billingsport was the first land purchase by the United States government, made by the Continental Congress on July 5, 1776. The port was first developed to handle petroleum products in 1917 by the Vacuum Oil Company. The Port of Paulsboro has been used to refer to the marine transfer operations at Thompson Point in Greenwich Township, Gibbstown (Greenwich Township), Billingsport, Mantua Creek, Eagle Point in West Deptford, and Westville. It is a port of entry in United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) District 21, which covers New Jersey. Tinicum Island Rear Range Light =Shipping channels and lighthouses= The Delaware River is tidal at Paulsboro, which is about from the Atlantic Ocean at the entrance to the Delaware Bay. Since 1942, the Delaware River Main Channel has been maintained at a depth of . A stretch of the federal navigation shipping channel is being deepened to from the Port of Camden and Port of Philadelphia to the bay, with a 2017 projected completion date. Local pilotage is generally required for larger commercial vessels. Anchorage No. 9 is in the vicinity of the mouth of Mantua Creek, to which the river channel is . Tinicum Island Rear Range Light and Tinicum Front Range Light, known as the Billingsport Front Light, are a pair of range lights serving the downstream reach of the port. These front and rear range lighthouses guide sailors who, by aligning the two lights and keeping one light on top of the other, stay in the channel's center and avoid Little Tinicum Island. The rear light is listed on the state and federal registers of historic places. =Road and rail= The port is located near New Jersey Route 44 and Interstate 295. Rail service on different spurs of the Penns Grove Secondary is within the South Jersey/Philadelphia Shared Assets Area of Conrail, which operates a rail yard along the line for owners CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern Railway. SMS Rail Lines handle transfers at parts of the port. Petroleum View across Delaware River to Paulsboro Refinery Mobil Valiant, 1965 As of 2010, crude oil accounted for more than half of all annual cargo tonnage on the Delaware River. Several refineries and oil depots in Paulsboro, Greenwich Township, and West Deptford have operated at the port since the first was developed in 1917. At various times, Citgo, Mobil, BP, Sun Oil, Valero, PBF Energy, and NuStar Energy have maintained facilities adjacent to the port, as has General American Transportation Corporation (GATX). In addition to maritime transfer operations, the petroleum facilities are also served by tanker trucks, rail transport, and pipelines, including one to the Philadelphia Airport across the river and one to nearby junction with the Colonial Pipeline system. =Facilitiies= The Paulsboro Refinery is a facility abutting Paulsboro in adjacent Gibbstown (Greenwich Township) and processes medium-to-heavy sour crude oils to produce unbranded gasoline, heating oil, and jet fuel. It is one of only two facilities on the East Coast able to process petroleum coke. It became a Special Purpose Subzone 142A of Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) No. 142 in 1995. In 1998, Valero Energy Corporation purchased the facility from Mobil and in 2010 sold it to PBF with backing from Blackstone Group and First Reserve Corporation.Bloomberg News.\\"Valero Energy to sell Paulsboro refinery for $360M\\", The Star-Ledger, September 27, 2012. Retrieved 2012-11-07. Construction of a new tanker berth was completed in 2010 by Weeks Marine. In 2019, PDF received special permission to receive liquified natural gas to the plant via rail. The Eagle Point Refinery in the Eagle Point section West Deptford was a oil refinery that had once been a tomato-processing factory and became a U.S. Army munitions depot during World Wars I and II. The property was acquired by Texaco and began refining operations in 1949. It was purchased by Coastal Oil in May 1985 and in 1997 became foreign trade Special Purpose Subzone 142C. In January 2004, it was bought by Sunoco, which announced its permanent closure in 2010. The plant is being disassembled by 2015 so that a new facility can be planned by Sunoco. Its adjacent tank farm, with tanker truck, rail, pipeline, and marine transfer operations, remain active. The Paulsboro Terminal started as an oil depot during World War I. In 1929, Patterson Oil further developed the property as an oil storage and fueling terminal. Eastern Gas & Fuels took over in 1954 and completed the terminal expansion. It sold the terminal in 1960 to Sinclair Refining Corporation. In 1969, after Sinclair and Atlantic Richfield Company merged, BP bought the property. The facility stopped operations in 1996 and is being redeveloped as part of the new omniport. The Citgo Asphalt Refining Company (CARCO) asphalt refinery on the east side of Mantua Creek was purchased by NuStar Energy in 2007. It became foreign trade Special Purpose Subzone 142B in 1996. NuStar also owned a small tank farm with a truck transport terminal in Billingsport. In 2008 NuStar sold half its business to Lindsay Goldberg, which bought the company outright in February 2014, renaming it Axeon Specialty Products. The asphalt refinery, ranked as America's largest, was scheduled to close in 2017. The Plains Terminal is a petroleum products storage and marine transfer facility in Billingsport which expanded its tank farm with eight new storage tanks in 2009. It has been owned by ExxonMobil, GATX Terminals Corporation, which was taken over by Kinder Morgan, and by Support Terminals Operating Partnership (a NuStar subsidiary). In 2012, Plains All American Pipeline and previous owners settled with NJ DEP to remediate hazardous substances in the soil at the site. It has been part of a foreign trade Special Purpose Subzone 142A since 1995. Athos 1 oil spill In 2019, the New Jersey Attorney General announced it would sue ExxonMobil for releasing toxic waste into Mantua Creek. =Tanker oil spills= On November 26, 2004, of crude oil spilled from the Cyprus-flagged oil tanker Athos 1, which was preparing to dock at the Citgo asphalt refinery, after its hull had been punctured by a submerged, discarded anchor. Citgo was cleared of liability in 2011. The oil spill has had lasting impact on the estuary. In October 2007, another spill took place at the port when approximately of oil leaked from the Tigani, an Malta-flagged tanker operated by Cardiff Marine. Solar array When opened in 2003 by BP on a landfill on the Dow Chemical brownfield site, the photovoltaic system, or solar array, which is adjacent to the former BP Paulsboro Terminal, was the largest facility for solar power in New Jersey and one of the largest on the East Coast. BP constructed the solar power facility, which was designed for 276 kilowatts peak demand and 350,000 kilowatt-hours per year, to showcase the potential for brownfield to brightfield redevelopment. Paulsboro Marine Terminal The South Jersey Port Corporation (SJPC) operates three terminals at the Port of Camden and one at the Port of Salem. The agency is working with Gloucester County Improvement Authority (GCIA) to develop a deep water omniport at the confluence of the Delaware River and Mantua Creek. Estimated to cost $274 million, construction began in the fall of 2009 for the marine terminal on brownfield sites at of a former BP crude oil and petrochemical storage facility and of a former chemical plant of Dow Chemical. The Paulsboro Marine Terminal will include an industrial park and is designed to integrate changing needs for industrial manufacturing, value-added processing, and distribution space, and to provide complete intermodal freight transport capabilities. The terminal will handle a diversity of bulk and break bulk cargo, as well as shipping containers. New infrastructure includes a wharf, warehouse space, sewers with storm water retention, roadway access, and rail infrastructure. It will include facility connections to the adjacent solar power facility. Originally scheduled to be opened in 2012, it was later postponed to 2013. Infrastructure construction work is being completed in phases and installation of the terminal facilities has been delayed further by a lack of commercial clients. The SJPC has preliminary Memorandum of Understandings with a number of companies. Dole Food Company considered relocating import operations, but in August 2013 decided to remain at the Port of Wilmington (Delaware). In July 2014, SJPC and Holt Logistics announced that the company would possibly moved some of their operations to Paulsboro as part of land exchange deal in the Port of Camden. The first tenant, NMLK Steel, will occupy approximately 40 acres of the port to bring steel slabs and transload them onto rail cars for distribution throughout the country. The port is slated to become a wind turbine manufacturing and staging area, such as above =Wind power logistics center= The port is targeted to become a manufacturing/assembly center for wind turbines for the development of wind power in New Jersey and other offshore wind power projects along the East Coast of the United States. In August 2010, legislation to encourage the development of wind power in New Jersey was signed by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie at the Port of Paulsboro. The Offshore Wind Economic Development Act authorized New Jersey Economic Development Authority to provide up to $100 million in tax credits for wind energy facilities. Studies completed in 2012 concluded that the port is well suited to become a center for the manufacture, assembly, and transport of wind turbines to be used to further the development of Atlantic Wind Connection. The port is slated to become the site for the production the enormous monopile foundations for turbines for the off-shore wind farm Ocean Wind. =Dredging= Site surveys for the Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) permit to build the project were performed by CH2M Hill. In 2011, USACE authorized additional dredging of a area at the confluence to in the river and in the creek to provide deep water berths and obtain dredge fill for the omniport. The terminal site has been raised by up to with of dredge fill from the river and creek in order to be above the 100-year floodplain and potential for sea-level rise due to climate change caused by global warming. =Docks= Doric Warrior (as seen in the Netherlands) was the first ship to arrive at new marine terminal Planned dock capacity would allow for a long barge mooring and of deep water berths of at Mean Low Water (MLW) that would also accommodate three Handymax size vessels. Construction of bulkheads is designed to protect submerged aquatic vegetation. The final wharf construction, which had been previously bid by three companies in 2012, may be delayed until 2016, pending signed lease agreements by South Jersey Port Corporation with companies that will use the port. Shippers and industrial companies can require a different range of wharf specifications, depending on the finished goods, materials, and commodities they handle. =Access road to I-295= Traditionally, access to various port facilities west of Mantua Creek has been via New Jersey Route 44 over a historic vertical lift bridge at mile point 1.7 built in 1935 and locally known as the Gateway to Paulsboro. Owned and operated by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT), it was last significantly renovated in 1986–1988. A portion of the road that would later be designated Interstate 295 was opened in 1948. The Gloucester County Improvement Authority is building a new connector, which is funded by the New Jersey Department of Transportation and is expected to be completed by 2014, that would create a gateway from I-295 to the new marine terminal. It includes a new access road and overpass bridge over the creek from Paradise Road in West Deptford between the Gloucester County sewage treatment plant and the NuStar Energy asphalt refinery. Paradise Road, which changes to Mantua Creek Road, provides direct access to Exit 19 of I-295. This new routing through West Deptford would avoid heavy truck traffic through residential areas of Paulsboro. =Rail infrastructure= The port is located within Conrail's South Jersey/Philadelphia Shared Assets Area. SMS Rail Lines handles interchanges with the Penns Grove Secondary line. New infrastructure at the omniport includes the construction of a rail crossing, turnouts, and of track with a balloon loop for dockside accessibility. It is expected to cost $3.2 million and be completed by 2014. Partial federal funding for this work was obtained in 2011 by SJPC, Conrail, and Salem County by leveraging $117.65 million of infrastructure funding for the marine terminal and other South Jersey projects. They include upgrading the southern section of the Salem Branch rail freight line from Swedesboro to the Port of Salem and retrofitting of the Delair Bridge, the most downstream rail crossing of the Delaware and the regional connection to the national rail network, to accommodate industry standard, capacity rail cars.  Jefferson Street Bridge The Jefferson Street Bridge is a railroad movable bridge over Mantua Creek upstream from its mouth. The \\"A-Frame\\", shear pole, swing bridge was originally constructed in 1917 and rebuilt in 1940. Once part of Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines (PRSL), it is now part of Conrail's Penns Grove Secondary. Originally manually opened, it was partially automated sometime between 2000 and 2003. Buckling of the bridge caused a derailment of a coal train in 2009. More than 15 rail cars left the tracks, though none toppled. In November 2012, seven cars derailed while crossing the bridge. Of the four cars that fell into the creek, one was punctured, releasing of highly toxic vinyl chloride, which required an evacuation in the region and Paulsboro school lock-downs. Removal of derailed cars and environmental cleanup was handled by U.S. Coast Guard. In March 2013, Conrail announced that the bridge would be replaced with an expected September 2014 operational date. Normally, between March 1 and November 30 the bridge is left in the open position for maritime traffic and closed when trains approach. It will remain locked in the closed position until the bridge is replaced. The new bridge opened in March 2015. Numerous lawsuits have been brought in the matter.

The series was produced by Second City Entertainment, Imagine Entertainment and MCA Television. Details The series, set in the fictional town of Derby, Wisconsin (\\"The Hat Capital of the World\\"), featured a local talk show aptly titled \\"My Talk Show\\", which was created by housewife and talk television fan Jennifer Bass, which aired on cable access. The program became a hit with viewers, leading to the series being picked up for syndication. The shows' setting took place in Bass' home with the garage being converted into an area for the studio audience, since the local television station in Bass' home town (possibly Milwaukee, since a channel 65 was circled as the station in the credits that showed a newspaper TV listings that also featured actual TV channels from Madison, Rockford and Chicago) could not accommodate any space for the production, so a satellite van and cameras were bought over to help tape the show for the airing. However, despite Bass' attempt to host a talk show (attempt being the operative word, and at times awkward to the point that she had to even include the audience to help move things along, like asking an audience member to disregard the introduction paper he was asked to read and just proceed with welcoming the host), she would be interrupted by best friend and next door neighbor Anne Marie Snelling, who also doubled as her sidekick, her brother-in-law Marty Dissler, Bucky Fergus, the town's multi-tasked city employee, her in-house organist (and my old school nurse, as pointed out by Jennifer) Mrs. Battle and other Derby residents, especially when it came to the guests who were scheduled to appear on the show. Midway through the series' run, Bass would be replaced by next door neighbor (and rival) Angela Davenport, who had been jealous of Jennifer hosting a talk show from the beginning, and D.A. Young replaced Mrs. Battle as the house musician. However, Angela also had the same problems as Jennifer when others showed up to disrupt the taping. Production The series was inspired in some ways by Fernwood 2 Night, which was set in the fictional town of Fernwood, Ohio, and also used the same premise involving midwestern American television programming but it also had some elements borrowed from SCTV as well, since some of the cast members were also Canadian. But the concept (the home doubling as a studio and other elements) was actually borrowed from another program, Tea With Michael Raye, a local cable access program that ran from 1985 to 2010 in the Los Angeles area. Raye was approached at first by the producers to bring his program to syndication, but the producers decided to go in a different direction instead, after the deal fell through.reviews (3 of 3) from IMDB However, the series had trouble in attracting viewers due to the stations that aired it in late nights (especially in later hours among network affiliated stations), resulting in MCA ending production on the show by December 1990. Michael Patrick King (who would go on to create CBS's 2 Broke Girls many years later) was among the writers for the series, while Colin Mochrie (Debra McGrath's husband) did recurring appearances in several episodes. Reviews Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the series a B+, praising Stevenson's performance as \\"Remarkable — a resourceful actress who does a subtle, funny job of portraying someone who's charming but awkward, a little bit flustered on-camera,\\" while commenting that \\"My Talk Show may be gimmicky, but it's an amusing, well- thought-out gimmick.\\"\\"My Talk Show (1990)\\" by Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly (September 21, 1990) Cast *Cynthia Stevenson as Jennifer Bass *Stephanie Hodge as Angela Davenport *Debra McGrath Anne Marie Snelling (McGrath also doubled as writer on the show) *David Packer as Marty Dissler *Ron James as Bucky Fergus *Betsy Townsend as Valarie Christie *Josephine Hinds as Mrs. Battle *D.A.

Lead singer Freddie Mercury plays the piano and provides all the vocals on the track. It was originally featured on Queen's third album, Sheer Heart Attack, released in 1974, and is one of the album's few ballads. In 1975, \\"Lily of the Valley\\" was released as the B-side of different singles in the U.K. and the United States. The U.K. single was \\"Now I'm Here\\", and the U.S. single was a reissue of \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\". For the former release the first measure of the song was excised to avoid the cross-fade with \\"Flick Of The Wrist\\", the preceding song on the parent album. On the latter release the first measure is present but the cross-fade is absent, making this version a true stand-alone mix. Further, on the U.S. single only, the song's end abuts the start of a stand-alone mix of 'God Save The Queen' from A Night At The Opera (that is, the album's cross- fade from \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" to \\"God Save The Queen\\" is absent). The lyrics refer back to a song from a previous album, \\"Seven Seas of Rhye\\" from Queen II, with the line \\"messenger from Seven Seas has flown, to tell the King of Rhye he's lost his throne.\\" In a 1999 interview, Brian May told the British music magazine Mojo, \\"Freddie's stuff was so heavily cloaked, lyrically... But you could find out, just from little insights, that a lot of his private thoughts were in there, although a lot of the more meaningful stuff was not very accessible. Lily of the Valley was utterly heartfelt. It's about looking at his girlfriend and realising that his body needed to be somewhere else. It's a great piece of art, but it's the last song that would ever be a hit.\\" Covers \\"Lily of the Valley\\" was covered by 1980s band Game Theory, whose frontman Scott Miller performed a version that appears as a bonus track on the 2015 Omnivore reissue of Game Theory's 1985 album Real Nighttime, produced by Mitch Easter.

Etymology Cinque Hommes Township is named after Cape Cinque Hommes on the Mississippi River. The original name was St. Cosme. However, the pronunciation of \\"St. Cosme\\" and \\"Cinque Hommes\\" is exactly the same in French, and the early Frenchmen who came after father St. Cosme, misunderstanding, called it by the latter name. History Cape St. Cosme or Cape Cinque Hommes — a point on the Mississippi River — was conferred for Father Jean Francois Buisson de Saint Cosme (1667-1702), a missionary priest from the Quebec Seminary of Foreign Missions, who visited the spot in 1698 and erected a cross on Grand Tower. Jean St. Cosme was the son of Michael Buisson, a native of Cosme le Vert in the Diocese of Mans in France, and of Susanne Licheraffe. He was ordained a Seminarian priest at the age of twenty- three. Father St. Cosme was stationed first at Tamarois, or Tamaroa, in Illinois, and also labored in Acadia, Louisiana, and among the Natchez Indians in lower Louisiana. He was massacred by a party of the Sitimaches or Chetimacha Indians while descending the Mississippi in 1702. The pronunciations of St. Cosme and Cinque Hommes (French: Five Men) is the same in French, and the early Frenchmen who came after father St. Cosme, misunderstanding, called it by the latter name. There is absolutely no tradition connected with five men, in either French or English.The State Historical Society of Missouri: Perry County Place Names http://shs.umsystem.edu/manuscripts/ramsay/ramsay_perry.html In 1807 the Ste. Genevieve District was divided into six townships: Benton, Bellevue, St. Michaels, Big River, Ste. Genevienve and Cinque Hommes. With Missouri Statehood came the subdivision of the territory into counties. Perry County was organized in 1821. Perry County was divided into 3 townships: Brazeau, including the territory between the Cinque Hommes and Apple Creek; Bois Brule, in the northeast part of the county; and Cinque Hommes in the remainder of the county. Geography Cinque Hommes covers an area of 55.5 square miles (143.7km2) and contains one incorporated village (Biehle), and three unincorporated communities: Highland, Millheim, and Schumer Springs. Cinque Hommes Creek flows through the township and was also named after Cape Cinque Hommes.Cinque Hommes township, Perry County, Missouri (MO) http://www.city- data.com/township/Cinque-Hommes-Perry-MO.htmlThe State Historical Society of Missouri: Perry County Place Names http://shs.umsystem.edu/manuscripts/ramsay/ramsay_perry.html Demographics =2000 census= As of the census of 2000, there were 1,210 people living in the township.

Cusson ex Juss., Monnier's snowparsley, is a flowering plant species in the genus Cnidium. Also known as Shechuangzi, Osthole, Jashoshi, Cnidii Fructus (Fruits of Cnidium). Do not confuse with Bacopa monneri, Cnidium officinale, (both similar but different plants). The coumarins osthol, imperatorin and xanthotoxol can be found in C. monnieri.  Naming  Cnidium monnieri was already described and the name validly published by Carl Linnaeus. It was Pierre Cusson, however, who reclassified it into today's valid botanical systematics in 1787.  Taxonomy  Cnidium monnieri is a species in the genus Cnidium which contains approximately 11 to 35 species and belongs to the family of the Apiaceae (carrot family).  Characteristics  Plants annual, 10–60(–80) cm. Taproot 2–3 mm thick. Stem solitary, striate, scabrous. Lower petioles 3–8 cm; blade ovate-lanceolate, 3–8 × 2–5 cm, 2–3-pinnate; ultimate segments linear to linear-lanceolate, 3–10 × 1–1.5 mm, veins and margins scabrous. Umbels 2–3(–5) cm across; bracts 6–10, linear to linear-lanceolate, 2–3 mm, persistent, margins narrowly white membranous, very finely ciliate; rays 8–20(–30), 5–20 mm, unequal; bracteoles 5–9, linear, nearly equal pedicels, margins ciliate; umbellules 15–20-flowered; pedicels 3–5 mm. Calyx teeth obsolete or minute. Stylopodium conic; styles 3–4 times longer than stylopodium. Fruit ovoid, 1.5–3 × 1–2 mm; lateral ribs slightly broader than the dorsal. Seed face plane. Fl. Apr–Jul, fr. Jul–Oct. = Growth = The plants reach heights of 10 to 80 centimetres. = Leaves = Cnidium monnieri has bipinnate leaves that are alternate. The linear leaflets are ciliate and petiolate. = Flowers and fruits = Cnidium monnieri produces compound umbels of white five-stellate flowers from April to July. The plants produce achenes. =Distribution= Cnidium monnieri is native to India, China, Korea, Laos, Mongolia, Vietnam, the European Russia (Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova, Crimea) and Europe. Grows in riparian grasslands and is adventive in North America (Oregon).  Cultivation  Pests and Diseases Literature: * Walter Erhardt, Erich Götz, Nils Bödeker, Siegmund Seybold: Der große Zander.

Medicinal use Cnidium monnieri (L.) Cuss. is one of the most widely used traditional herbal medicines and its fruits have been used to treat a variety of diseases in China, Vietnam, and Japan. As of this writing, 350 compounds have been isolated and identified from C. monnieri, including the main active constituent, coumarins. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that osthole and other coumarin compounds possess wide range of pharmacological properties for the treatment of female genitals, male impotence, frigidity, skin-related diseases, and exhibit strong antipruritic, anti-allergic, antidermatophytic, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-osteoporotic effects. Although coumarins have been identified as the main active constituents responsible for the observed pharmacological effects, the molecular mechanisms of their actions are still unknown. A pro-erectile herb from traditional Chinese medicine, Cnidium monnieri and its main bioactive known as osthole appear to have mechanisms similar to Viagra in penile tissue and the hippocampus; the influence of Cnidium monnieri on testosterone and cognition remains unexplored.

The painting was probably commissioned in 1624 on the occasion of their 20th wedding anniversary. The eldest son Pieter is standing behind his father in the painting. He later married but died without issue. His brother Gijsbert the younger, standing on the far right with the goat cart, died young in 1641 and his other brother Cornelis is portrayed in the painting as the son whose cheek is being touched by his mother's left hand. The family was Catholic and Gijsbert's son Cornelis became a Haarlem notary who mostly dealt with other Haarlem Catholics. The painting was later inherited by Cornelis' daughter Agnes, who died in 1666. It was sometime after her death and before 1680 that the painting was cut into two, probably because the painting left the house and the walls of the new location were too small.Left Half: RKDimages, Art- work number 144724 in the RKD Natural pose The painting is the earliest known family portrait by Hals and is remarkable for its informal outside \\"picnic style\\", which became quite popular.

Biography Egill's father was Eyjólfur, a gold- smith, and his mother Þorgerður Egilsdóttir. Egill studied at the monastery of Þingeyri, being taught alongside Einarr Hafliðason by Lárentíus Kálfsson. Egill first became a deacon, was then consecrated as a priest in 1318, and around the same time became the schoolmaster at Hólar. At that time, the bishop of Hólar was Auðunn rauði Þorbergsson, whose relationship with the monks of Þingeyri (not least Lárentíus) was very strained. According to Laurentius Saga, it was through Egill's efforts that in the autumn of 1319, Auðun and Lárentíus made peace. Egill subsequently held the benefice of Grímstungur in Vatnsdalur, and in 1324 received the benefice of Grenjaðarstaðir in Aðaldalur (the wealthiest in the diocese of Hólar) from Archbishop Eilif Arnesson Kortin. Around 1327, Bishop Lárentius sent Egill to the Archbishop to plead Lárentíus‘s case against the monks of Möðruvellir. After Lárentíus's death in 1331, Egill was elected bishop of Hólar. Little is known about his episcopate, though it is said that the diocese's finances were well managed under his governance. Egill was succeeded as bishop by Ormur Ásláksson.

Her three marriages represented a component of her family's and her own political machinations. Her first husband, Zurab, Duke of Aragvi, was put to death at the behest of Darejan's father in 1630. Her second and third marriages, to Alexander III and Vakhtang I, respectively in 1630 and 1661, made her a queen consort of Imereti, in western Georgia, where Darejan became embroiled in a series coups and counter- coups. She was eventually murdered by members of the rival party in Kutaisi.  Early life and first marriage  Darejan was a daughter of Teimuraz I of Kakheti and his second wife Khorashan, a sister of the neighboring Georgian monarch, Luarsab II of Kartli. In 1623, Teimuraz married off Darejan to his influential vassal, Zurab, Duke of Aragvi, in spite of the protests from Queen Khorashan, who blamed Zurab's family for many misfortunes that had befallen on her native Kartli. The marriage secured Zurab's support to Teimuraz against the warlord Giorgi Saakadze, in 1626, although Saakadze was himself married to Zurab's sister. Rid of Saakadze, Teimuraz then instigated Zurab to assassinate the rival pro-Persian ruler Simon II of Kartli in 1630, but he soon began to suspect Zurab of regal ambitions. Teimuraz invited his son-in-law to dinner and had him beheaded. He then sent Zurab's severed head to the Persian shah Safi to prove his loyalty and to maintain his innocence in Simon II's death.  Second marriage  On 14 May 1631, at Saportseli near Gori, Teimuraz married his widowed daughter to Crown Prince Alexander of Imereti. On this occasion, Teimuraz was presented with Shah Safi's decree confirmed him as a vassal king of Kartli and Kakheti, all of eastern Georgia. Having married Darejan to the Imeretian heir apparent, Teimuraz could now lay a foundation for unification of Georgia's three kingdoms. Alexander became king of Imereti in 1638 and died on 1 March 1660. He recognized no heir; Bagrat, his son by his first wife, had been disowned by Alexander; Leonti, his son by Darejan, died; he had adopted Luarsab, a son of Darejan's late brother David, but the boy also died. Prior to his death, Alexander, thus, had to recall his son Bagrat from Guria and make him his heir. Queen Dowager Darejan crowned Bagrat, but she had no intention of giving up her power. Although both were in their forties, Bagrat had to reckon with his step-mother's ambitions. Three days after Alexander's funeral, Darejan made Bagrat marry her niece Ketevan. All documents issued in Imereti during these years bore first Darejan's name, and second Bagrat's. As the conflict was brewing, the nobles became divided in two parties. Papuna, duke of Racha, urged Bagrat to employ the Ottoman force to remove Darejan, while the queen dowager enjoyed support of the catholicos Simon I.  Civil war  Queen Darejan and her ladies-in-waiting. A drawing from De Castelli's travel album. The matters headed to an open confrontation when Darejan persuaded Bagrat to divorce her niece Ketevan and suggested to the king that he should now marry her. On Bagrat's refusal, he was seized by Darejan's supporters and blinded. Darejan then offered the crown to her father Teimuraz, who had been ousted from eastern Georgia by the Persians and was then living in the Skanda castle in Imereti. Teimuraz, astounded by his daughter's vices, refused. Darejan then seized power, married an insignificant nobleman, Vakhtang Tchutchunashvili, who claimed a Bagrationi descent, and had him crowned king. The people of Imereti were outraged. The nobles of Lower Imereti invited Vameq III Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia, and those of Upper Imereti called for Vakhtang V of Kartli to intervene and overthrow Darejan and her husband. Vameq took the couple prisoner, had Vakhtang blinded, and usurped the throne of Imereti. Darejan appealed to Vakhtang V of Kartli for help, offering her now divorced niece Ketevan for Vakhtang V's son Archil, and her throne to Vakhtang himself. Vakhtang of Kartli moved into Upper Imereti in 1661 and Imereti became a battleground for the rulers of Kartli and Mingrelia. During the turmoil Darejan and her husband became hostages of the Ottoman pasha of Akhaltsikhe and were placed under arrest in Oltu, from where she asked, via her Moscow-based nephew Nicholas, the tsar of Russia to intervene, but her pleas remained unanswered.  Death  Imereti remained in a state of anarchy. In 1668, Aslan, the pasha of Akhaltsikhe, motivated partly by a bribe offered by Darejan and partly the massacre of the Turkish soldiers at Kutaisi, marched into Imereti, placed Darejan and Vakhtang on the thrones, and plundered much of the country. The royal couple did not long survive their restoration. Different accounts are given of the manner of their deaths. According to the 18th-century Georgian historian Prince Vakhushti, certain of the nobles of Imereti persuaded Darejan's vizier Khosia Lashkhishvili to kill her. According to this version, Khosia murdered her with a spear as she was doing her hair while other conspirators dispatched her husband Vakhtang in the square outside. The French traveler Jean Chardin relates, on the other hand, that the vizier lured Darejan to his apartment where Darejan was then stabbed to death. Following Chardin, Darejan's husband was held until the arrival of the blind Bagrat, the legitimate monarch, who had his hand guided as he stabbed the usurper repeatedly, exclaiming, \\"Traitor, you had my eyes put out; I shall tear out your heart!\\" Yet another 18th-century Georgian source, the anonymous Paris Chronicle, reports that Khosia Akhvlediani conspired with Prince Sekhnia Chkheidze to attack her while they were discussing state affairs in the presence of Bishop Sophron of Gelati. Khosia wounded the queen in her breast with a musket shot, then tied her up and bribed the Turkish garrison soldiers to allow him to stab her to death in the castle gateway. In the meantime, her husband Vakhtang was beheaded. The couple were interred at the Church of All Saints in Kutaisi. A year later, Darejan was afforded a royal burial at the Gelati Monastery.

Life  Vilain was seemingly the son of Oudard d'Aulnay, a Champenois nobleman who in 1206 succeeded Geoffrey of Villehardouin as marshal of Champagne, after the latter left to join the Fourth Crusade. The scholar J. Longnon considers it possible, but not verifiable, that Oudard's mother was a sister of Villehardouin.Longnon (1939), pp. 15, 43-44 Oudard had three sons, Erard, Geoffrey and Vilain. The former two remained in Champagne, while Vilain soon departed to seek his fortune in the Latin Orient.Longnon (1939), p. 44 Vilain is attested for the first time in the Latin Empire in 1229, when he was sent, along with Ponce of Lyon, by the barons of the Empire to offer the regency over the young Baldwin II of Constantinople to John of Brienne. In 1238, he is already attested as \\"Marshal of Romania\\" (i.e. the Latin Empire) in the treaty whereby the Crown of Thorns was pawned to the Venetian Nicholas Quirini for the sum of 13,134 gold hyperpyra.de Mély (1904), p. 269 In 1234, he was possibly sent on a diplomatic mission to the Queen of France, Blanche of Castile, on behalf of Baldwin II. It appears that Vilain undertook frequent journeys to France, and in February 1249, his cousin, the Prince of Achaea William II of Villehardouin, ceded him in a letter to Thibaud IV, Count of Champagne, the proceeds of all the estates of the Villehardouin family in Champagne.Longnon (1939), pp. 12, 34, 44 In 1261, with the reconquest of Constantinople by the Byzantines and the collapse of the Latin Empire, Vilain was one of those nobles who fled to the court of Achaea. There William II, created for him a new barony out of lands taken from the princely domain, the Barony of Arcadia.Bon (1969), pp. 104, 412–413 Vilain died ca. 1269, and was succeeded by his sons, Erard I and Geoffrey.Bon (1969), pp. 157, 413 References Sources  Category:1269 deaths Category:13th-century French people Category:Barons of the Principality of Achaea Category:Marshals of the Latin Empire Category:Medieval Messenia Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Vilain I of Aulnay"},{"id":"39889849","text":"Arngrímr Brandsson (died 13 October 1361) was an Icelandic cleric and writer. Arngrímr‘s early life and career has long been the subject of debate; the evidence for it is sometimes contradictory. The synthesis of the evidence by Jón Helgason is widely seen as the most convincing.Jón Helgason, 'Introduction', in Jón Helgason ed., Biskupa sǫgur: MS Perg. fol. No. 5 in the Royal Library of Stockholm (Copenhagen: Einar Munksgaard, 1950), pp. 15-21 (pp. 16-18), cited by Erika Ruth Sigurdson, 'The Church in Fourteenth-Century Iceland: Ecclesiastical Administration, Literacy, and the Formation of an Elite Clerical Identity' (unpublished Ph.D. thesis, University of Leeds, 2011), p. 58, http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/2610/ . In this account, Arngrímr was consecrated as a secular priest, held the benefice of Oddi, and served Bishop Jón Halldórsson of Skálholt. In 1341, he took holy orders, possibly in Þykkvibær. He certainly became abbot of the monastery of Þingeyraklaustur in 1351, a position which he held until his death. Arngrímr supported the otherwise unpopular Bishop Ormr Ásláksson, during whose episcopate Arngrímr rose to the position of officialis of Iceland's northern diocese of Hólar, which he held from 1347 to 1351 and again from 1354 to 1357. Arngrímr is now most noted for making the latest and longest version of Guðmundar saga biskups, known as version D, probably at Ormr Ásláksson‘s request, and in conjunction with Bishop Guðmundur Arason's exhumation in 1344. Arngrímr also composed a drápa in honour of the bishop, alongside that composed by Einarr Gilsson. He can be seen as part of the North Icelandic Benedictine School of saga-writing.

Since the saga survives in different versions, it is common to speak of it in the plural, as Guðmundar sögur (rather than Guðmundar saga). History of the versions The first version, known as the Prestssaga Guðmundar byskups, was composed soon after Guðmundur‘s death in 1237, possibly at the instigation of abbot Lambkárr Þorgilsson (d. 1249). It recounts the bishop‘s life as a young man and priest but stops abruptly during a description of Guðmundr's voyage to Norway for consecration in 1202. It may therefore be unfinished. However, it is preserved only through its integration into the later Guðmundar sögur and Sturlunga saga. A series of four sagas about Bishop Guðmundr, known as Guðmundar sögur A, B, C, and D, were then written between 1314 and 1344, in what seems to have been a concerted attempt to canonise Guðmundr. Stefán Karlsson has connected the composition of Guðmundar sögur A, B, and possibly C, to the translation of Guðmundur's relics by Bishop Auðunn rauði Þorbergsson in 1314, while Guðmundar saga D was apparently composed by Arngrímr Brandsson for the second translation of Guðmundur's relics by Bishop Ormr Ásláksson in 1344. * Guðmundar saga A (sometimes known as the 'oldest saga') is from the first half of the fourteenth century, most likely 1320-30. It combines the Prestssaga with other material from Hrafns saga Sveinbjarnarsonar, Íslendinga saga, Arons saga Hjörleifssonar, and annals, with little original writing by the compiler. The main manuscript of this version is AM 399 4to (c. 1330×50). * Guðmundar saga B (sometimes known as the 'middle saga') probably dates from shortly after 1320. It combines material from Prestssaga, Hrafns saga Sveinbjarnarsonar, Íslendinga saga, and additional material, with authorial commentary, and aims to write Bishop Guðmundr as a saint. The main manuscript is AM 657c 4to (c. 1350). * Guðmundar saga C (which has yet to be edited) was based either on B or the same sources, around 1320-45.Sections are presented by Peter Foote, 'Bishop Jörundr Þorsteinsson and the relics of Guðmundr inn góði Arason‘, in Studia Centenalia in Honorem Memoriae Benedikt S. Þórarinsson (Reykjavík: Ísafold, 1961), pp 98-114. Unlike the earlier versions, written in the spartan, classical saga-style, version C was consistently rewritten in the 'florid style' associated with the North Icelandic Benedictine School of saga- writing. It may have been made by Bergr Sokkason. The rearrangements of the source material seem to have been intended to produce the life of a confessor, with a vita followed by a list of post mortem miracles. C survives only in incomplete, seventeenth-century manuscripts. * Guðmundar saga D, based on the C-text, was by a monk called Arngrímr, generally thought to be Arngrímr Brandsson, and can be seen as belonging in style to the North Icelandic Benedictine School of saga-writing. It was composed after 1343; the oldest manuscript is Stockholm Perg. fol. no. 5 (c. 1350-60); and two different versions seem to have been in circulation early in the version's history. Version D both omits and adds material in its efforts to strengthen Guðmundr's saintly image. This version included praise-poetry of Guðmundr by the author and by another poet, thought to be Einarr Gilsson. The various explanations of Icelandic customs in the saga suggest that it was intended for a foreign audience, and it has been suggested that D is a translation from Latin. No such Latin text is known, however.

In general the cuisine is very hearty and features many peculiarities of Mid-Germany such as a great variety of sauces which accompany the main dish and the fashion to serve Klöße/Knödel as a side dish instead of potatoes, pasta or rice. Also much freshwater fish is used in Saxon cuisine, particularly carp and trout as is the case throughout Eastern Europe. The rich history of the region did and still does influence the cuisine. In the blossoming and growing cities of Dresden and Leipzig an extravagant style of cuisine is cherished as exemplified by crab as an ingredient in Leipziger Allerlei. Other regions where the people had to work really hard to yield some harvest and were really poor like in the Erzgebirge peasant dishes play a major role and famous dishes originating there are e.g. potatoes with quark, potato soup or potato with bread and linseed oil. Also in the region Vogtland there were many peasants but they were wealthier and that's why in this region the Sunday roast is a tradition that is nowadays still lived up to. Beer in Saxony Throughout Saxony there are brewery traditions and traditional beers. Many famous varieties are brewed there, such as Freiberger, Radeberger, and Wernesgrüner, which was especially in the time of the GDR frequently exported. Desserts and sweets The baking goods and pastries of the cuisine of Saxony are known to be varied and unique. The German tradition of Kaffee und Kuchen (lit. coffee and cake), Gaffee un Guchn in the Saxon dialect, originates in Saxony and the Saxons were the first to serve cake with their coffee. This distinction can be seen in the expressions Kaffeesachse and Kaffeetante (which conveys the idea that 'aunties' (Tanten) or old women would meet to gossip over a cup of coffee). This custom, which shows the cultural relations to the cuisine of Austria, and that of Bohemia, is still followed today. No other region in Germany has such a distinct and rich café-culture as Saxony. This can be seen in the many old, grandiose coffeehouses in Leipzig, where the first German café was opened, and in Dresden.

Tisch is the former Chancellor of the New York State Board of Regents and wife of James S. Tisch, an heir to the Loews Corporation. In November 2015, she stepped down from her role after nearly 20 years on the board. Background Tisch was born Merryl Hiat to Rabbi Philip Hiat. Meryl's sister, Susan Hiat, was married (since divorced) to James's brother, Andrew Tisch. She received a B.A. from Barnard College, an M.A. from New York University and an Ed.D. from Teachers College, Columbia University. She taught first graders at the Ramaz School in the Upper East Side of Manhattan and at the B’nai Jeshurun School from 1977 to 1984. Tisch has served in various civic service positions, including at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy, the UJA-Federation of New York, the Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and the Citizens Budget Commission. Tisch is the chairperson of the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty. Tisch is on the Board of the Dalton School on the Upper East Side and Barnard College. Tisch was appointed to the New York State Board of Regents on April 1 of 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2011. The Board elected her Vice Chancellor effective April 1, 2007 and Chancellor effective April 1, 2009, and re-elected to a three-year term effective April 1, 2010. Controversies She said that budget restraints left the Board in May 2011 with no choice other than to cancel January Regents tests. At the end of May 2011, principals affiliated with the New Visions for Public Schools signed a letter of complaint directed to Tisch and the Board, arguing that the elimination of the tests would lead to a higher dropout rate and would cost the state money. She has criticized Pearson PLC, the education text and test publisher, recently questioning its ability to handle its growing workload. “Obviously, the public is starting to question, I think, very aggressively with us whether or not they’re able to manage all of the things they’ve taken on.” Following a protest rally at Albany by the New York State United Teachers, she acknowledged that New York State would hold off on a plan to raise the percentage by which test scores would count in a teacher's evaluation from 20 percent to 25 percent. A provision in the state’s evaluation law, passed in 2010, allows for the increase if officials adopt a more complex “value-added” model to measure student growth. She faced organized opposition when she returned on May 21, 2013 to her alma mater, Teachers College, for an award. Education professor and activist Diane Ravitch dubbed her “the Doyenne of high-stakes testing. Political involvements Tisch was a supporter of former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani. In April 2013, Tisch announced that she would become chairwoman of the campaign of former New York City comptroller Democrat Bill Thompson.

Dayton served in the Army during World War II, earning a Purple Heart. After the war, he joined the family business, Dayton's department store. He held various positions in the company, and urged the company to take advantage of the emerging discount store market. In 1960, he became the first president of Dayton's new discount subsidiary, Target. He oversaw the company's expansion until 1969 when he became a vice president of Target's parent company after a merger. Dayton left the business in 1972, forming a venture capital firm in 1974. He retired in 1994 but remained active in charity work until his death in 2013. Early life Douglas James Dayton was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota on December 2, 1924. He was youngest of five brothers. His father, George N. Dayton, became the president of the family business, Dayton Dry Goods Company, in 1938. The business, which evolved into Dayton's department store, was founded by Douglas' grandfather, George D. Dayton. Dayton graduated from the Blake School and then went to Amherst College. In 1943, he joined the Army. He served as a sergeant in an Army infantry division during World War II, earning a Purple Heart after being injured fighting in Europe. Career Dayton joined the family business after the war, becoming one of six grandsons of George D. Dayton to work in the business. In 1948, he and his brothers took over the company from their father. In 1954, Dayton opened Dayton's first branch store and subsequently served as vice president of branch stores and merchandise vice president at different times. As a store manager, he saw the rise of discounter Kmart and urged the company to reposition itself to compete with the discount chain. In 1960, Dayton and John F. Geisse teamed up to launch Target, which aimed to be an upscale discount store, in 1962. Dayton became the first president of the new business, a subsidiary of Dayton's. He promised that the new company would \\"combine the best of the fashion world with the best of the discount world.\\" The store was an instant success, leading Dayton to boast the chain would hit $100 million in annual sales. His brothers doubted his ambitious prediction, but it became a reality in 1968. Even so, competitors such as Kmart were growing at a faster rate. Dayton did not doubt his vision, remarking \\"I am thoroughly convinced that we are selling a superior product that will bear the test of time.\\" In 1969, the Dayton's merged with J.L. Hudson Company and Dayton left Target to become a senior vice president in the new company, Dayton Hudson Corporation. During Douglas Dayton's tenure, Target expanded from its initial four stores to twelve across several states. He also oversaw the opening of the company's first distribution center. Dayton found he did not like working in administration and left Dayton Hudson in 1972. He spent the next two years leading a team of volunteer executives that helped find ways for the state government to run more efficiently. In 1974, Dayton formed a venture capital firm, Dade Development Capital, which he ran until his retirement in 1994. He called his time as president of Target \\"the most challenging, rewarding and productive\\" years of his career. By 1975, Target was the company's top revenue producer and by the end of the 1970s annual sales exceeded $1 billion. In 2000, the parent company took the Target name from its stores. At the time of Dayton's death, the company he once led was the 36th largest company in the United States. Philanthropy Throughout his career, Dayton was active in social activism and a wide variety of philanthropic activities. The Dayton family started one of the first corporate-giving programs in Minnesota and Douglas Dayton said he always found donating money more satisfying than making it. He remained active in philanthropy after his retirement from the business world. Dayton campaigned for social justice, educational and environmental causes, and the arts. He served on the boards of the Urban League, Summit Academy, the Minneapolis Urban Coalition, and Nature Conservancy, among other philanthropic organizations. Dayton served as chairman of the board for the area YMCA for more than 50 years and worked with the University of Minnesota's Raptor Center on prairie restoration. \\"The YMCA was like a religion for him,\\" remarked Dayton's son David. Personal Life In 1952, Dayton married Mary Downing Haldeman (1927-2008). They had three sons: David Douglas, Steven James and Bruce Conner. They divorced on February 9, 1977. He married secondly Shirley Deyo Whiteman (1931-1997), a divorced woman who had three daughters by her previous marriage and descendant of Louis DuBois (Huguenot), on December 17, 1977. Following her death, Dayton married thirdly Wendy Lynn White (1951-) on January 9, 1998. Death Dayton died of cancer on July 5, 2013 at the age of 88. He is survived by his wife, Wendy; sons, David, Steve, and Bruce; stepdaughter, Elizabeth; and six grandchildren. According to a statement released by Target, \\"Doug was instrumental in helping to guide the strategic direction of Dayton Hudson Corporation for many years and institutionalized the values that are at the heart of Target Corporation today.\\" His nephew and governor of Minnesota, Mark Dayton, called Douglas Dayton \\"an extraordinary businessman, philanthropist, and leader of our family.\\" Mark Dayton said modesty prevented Douglas from claiming \\"the public recognition he deserved,\\" but said his contributions had made \\"an enormous difference\\" to thousands of employees and customers of Target.

This movement is characterised by an elaborate (or 'florid') rhetorical style new to Icelandic saga-writing at the time (known in English as the 'florid style', Scandinavian as the florissante stil, and Icelandic as the skrúðstíll), with Latinate grammar, Latin and Low German loan-words; and, unusually for Icelandic sagas, which are usually anonymous, a close-knit network of identifiable authors (sometimes self-identified, sometimes named by others). The school is associated particularly with the Northern Icelandic Benedictine monasteries of Þingeyri and Munkaþverá in the diocese of Hólar, and with the students of Jón Halldórsson and Lárentíus Kálfsson. The principal authors and works associated with this literary movement are: * Árni Lárentíusson, author of Dunstanus saga (translated from the Latin life of the Anglo-Saxon Saint Dunstan). * Arngrímr Brandsson, author of Guðmundar saga D, and possibly the translator of Thomas saga erkibyskups (the life of Thomas Becket). * Bergr Sokkason, author of Nikulás saga erkibiskups (a translation of the life of St Nicholas) and Mikaels saga höfuðengils (the life of the Archangel Michael); and possibly the L-version of Jóns saga helga, Guðmundar saga C, and Jóns þáttr Halldórssonar. He or his associates may also have composed a substantial number of other sagas, such as Kirjalax saga, Rémundar saga keisarasonar, and Dínus saga drambláta. * Einarr Hafliðason, translator of the miracle-story Atburð á Finnmörk and probably author of Laurentius saga and the Lögmannsannáll. * Einarr Gilsson. Among the various manuscripts which can be associated with the movement, the mid-fourteenth-century AM 657 a-b 4to is a good example: it is the oldest manuscript to contain the text of Bergr's Jóns þáttr Halldórssonar; it also contains Marian miracles, Bergr's Mikaels saga; Jón Halldórsson's Drauma-Jóns saga; Hákonar þáttr Hárekssonar; Jón Halldórsson's Clári saga, as well as several exempla.http://handrit.is/is/manuscript/view/da/AM04-0657-a-b.

Life  Guy was a scion of the Dramelay (or Trimolay, Tremolay) family from the namesake village in Burgundy, who had held the Barony of Chalandritsa since 1209, when a \\"G. of Dramelay\\" (possibly \\"Guy\\", in which case this would be Guy I) is attested among the signatories of the Treaty of Sapienza. Many older histories, following Jean Alexandre Buchon and Karl Hopf, have Audebert de la Trémouille as the first baron.Bon (1969), pp. 107, 459 His successor, Robert, is attested ca. 1230. It was he who built the castle of Chalandritsa, according to the Greek and Italian versions of the Chronicle of the Morea. He was in turn succeeded by his son Guy (II).Bon (1969), pp. 107, 459 The Aragonese version of the Chronicle on the other hand reports a completely different story, according to which the castle of Chalandritsa had been built by Conrad of Aleman, Baron of Patras, and that it and other lands, comprising eight knight's fiefs, were purchased around 1259 by Prince William II of Villehardouin and given to a knight named Guy of Dramelay, who had only recently arrived in the Morea. While otherwise reliable, the Aragonese version is considered erroneous in this regard.Bon (1969), pp. 107–108 Guy's tenure as a baron is relatively obscure. In 1280, he is known to have enlarged the barony by acquiring neighbouring lands such as parts of the Lisarea or the fief of Mitopoli.Bon (1969), pp. 106 note 2, 161, 459 In November 1282, Guy was named bailli of the Principality for the King of Naples instead of Narjot de Toucy, whose duties as Admiral of the kingdom did not allow him to take up the post.

She was a Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1982 to 1992, representing the electorate of Ringwood. She was Minister for Conservation, Forests and Lands from 1988 to 1990, Minister for Community Services from 1990 to 1992 and Minister Responsible for Child Care from 1991 to 1992. Setches was born in Melbourne, and was educated at St Joseph's Collingwood, Cromwell Street State School, and the Collingwood School of Domestic Arts. She resided in Croydon from 1964, and was a shop assistant before entering politics. She joined the Labor Party in 1972 and was involved in a number of community organisations, including serving as co-ordinator of the Maroondah Halfway House Group, a women's refuge, from 1977 to 1978 and president of the Boronia Technical School Council from 1979 to 1983. She was also an advocate for the rights of people with intellectual disabilities. Setches was elected to the Legislative Assembly at the 1982 state election, defeating two-term Liberal MP Peter McArthur, and was re-elected in 1985 and 1988. She was promoted to the ministry in 1988 as Minister for Conservation, Forests and Lands, shifted to Minister for Community Services in 1990, and added the new portfolio of Minister Responsible for Child Care in 1991. Setches was minister during a period of significant change: she introduced mandatory reporting of child abuse, formally closed the notorious Sunbury Asylum however little was done to accommodate the insane who for the most part were left to roam the streets in places like St Kilda resulting in some being shot by police after turning violent, increased funding to Kew Cottages, and advocated the outlawing of surrogacy. Her seat of Ringwood was abolished for the 1992 election and she contested and lost the new notionally Labor seat of Bayswater as Labor were resoundingly defeated that year. In retirement, she was one of the co-founders of EMILY's List Australia, and was a board member of the Victorian Women's Trust and the Queen Victoria Women's Centre Trust. She was one of the inaugural additions to the Victorian Honour Roll of Women in 2001. She subsequently retired to Victoria Harbour at Docklands, and has spoken about planning issues in the area. Both of her children have been involved in Labor politics; her son, Earl Setches, is the secretary of the Plumbing Trades Employees Union, and her daughter, Vicki Setches, was the unsuccessful Labor candidate for Kilsyth at the 2010 state election. Three of her parliamentary advisers, Alan Griffin, Gavin Jennings and Lynne Kosky, subsequently went on to political careers of their own as federal and state ministers.

Dickin medal On 16 December 1944, a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress from the U.S. Eighth Air Force carrying a full payload of bombs, crashed into the Cheviot Hills on the border between England and Scotland. Two local shepherds, John Dagg and Frank Moscrop headed up the mountainside with Dagg's sheepdog Sheila to investigate and see if there was anything they could do to help. The ongoing blizzard reduced the visibility on the mountainside to the bare minimum and the duo had to rely on Sheila to track down the aircraft. She tracked four of the airmen who were in a nearby crevice to escape the weather, and took the two shepherds to their location. Together they led the airmen back down to their cottage, arriving as the bombs on the B-17 detonated.

Discovery During the winter of the Phoney War at the start of the Second World War, Václav Robert Bozděch and Pierre Duval were sent on a reconnaissance mission over the German front in their twin-seater Potez 630 aircraft from the French airbase at Saint-Dizier. It was hit by anti-aircraft fire and crashed in no-mans land between the French and German lines.Lewis (2013): pp. 2–3 Bozděch helped the injured Duval to an abandoned farm house nearby, wherein the Czech airman discovered a German Shepherd puppy on the floor in the kitchen.Lewis (2013): pp. 8–11 While the dog was not initially fond of Duval, it accepted Bozděch.Lewis (2013): p. 14 Concerned that the puppy was emaciated, he began to feed it chocolate, but it would not eat it until the rations were partially melted. Bozděch also found an old frying pan, filled it with snow and melted it so that the dog could drink it.Lewis (2013): p. 18 The two airmen realised that they had to make for the French lines at night or risk capture by the Germans before morning. Bozděch left a pan of water and some more chocolate with the dog, and they locked it inside the farmhouse before heading off across the snow to a nearby wood. Almost immediately upon leaving the property, the night sky was lit up by flares fired by the Germans as they were looking for the aircrew from the nearby crash site.Lewis (2013): p. 19 They had nearly reached the trees when they could hear the dog howling from the farmhouse. They agreed that the only course of action was for Bozděch to return and kill the dog. He left Duval in the snow, and went back to the house. As he approached he searched for a large rock or heavy object with which to kill the puppy in the most humane manner he could. The dog began to throw itself at the locked door as it heard someone approaching.Lewis (2013): pp. 21–22 Bozděch opened the door and found he could not kill the animal, instead picking it up and placing it next to his chest inside his flight jacket.Lewis (2013): p. 23 The trio made it into the cover of the trees, and were discovered by a party of French troops who had been sent to look for them.Lewis (2013): p. 28 They took the dog back to the base with them, where Duval was sent to the hospital. Bozděch met back up with his fellow Czech airmen in exile, who all played with the puppy. It was decided to name him Ant, after their favourite aircraft from back in Czechoslovakia.Lewis (2013): p. 33 Military service =French Air Force= A diagram of a Potez 630, the type of plane in which Antis took his first flight Ant saw little action during the remainder of the Phoney War, but adopted Bozděch as his master, sleeping at the foot of his bed in barracks. With the end of the Phoney War on 10 May 1940,Lewis (2013): p. 34 the airfield at Saint-Dizier was bombed by a wing of German Dornier Do 17s, while Bozděch and Ant were huddled in a bunker. The attack destroyed all but fourteen of the planes at the base, and following this the local forces began their retreat. After moving to their third base, Bozděch took the decision to take Ant with him in the Potez 630 for the dog's first combat mission. Ant barely stirred, even when Bozděch was firing the guns at German fighters.Lewis (2013): pp. 36–39 The duo were reunited with a recovered Duval, who became Bozděch's pilot once again, while Ant continued to fly with them.Lewis (2013): p. 42 During the latter part of the Battle of France on 14 June, a flight of Messerschmitt Bf 110s destroyed the remaining planes of Bozděch's squadron while they were on the ground. Three days later, the squadron was informed by their adjutant that they were disbanding. Ant and the Czech airmen made for Tours, some to the south, where the nearest railway station was located to travel south to Spain and then Gibraltar, from where they could fight on from the United Kingdom. They were concerned how they might make their way at speed to Tours, but on leaving the village they discovered a party underway at a nearby house, celebrating the German invasion.Lewis (2013): pp. 44–46 The group proceeded to steal a trap from the house after subduing a guard using Ant as a distraction. They stacked their possessions on the trap, with Ant sat on top. The men took turns pulling the trap, heading instead to Blois, with the remainder pushing from behind. They joined the columns of refugees on the roads heading south. However, Ant kept getting unbalanced and falling off the cart, delaying their journey and causing one of the party to suggest that they should kill the dog.Lewis (2013): pp. 49–50 Bozděch elected instead to carry the dog and, after a while, they began to take turns carrying Ant over their shoulders. They reached Blois and were directed to a train to Montpellier further down the track where they found it overwhelmed with people trying to board. Ant shot off towards the rear of the train, before stopping by a cattle truck. Bozděch tried to open it up, but it was locked. He banged on it in the hope someone was already inside and was surprised when it was opened, revealing that the only people inside were a woman and her two daughters. The reason why Ant had been attracted to that particular carriage, was because one of the girls had been eating chocolate at the time. When she later offered him a piece, he didn't wait for it to be melted like when he was a puppy, but instead ate it excitedly.Lewis (2013): pp. 51–54 The overloaded train made slow progress, moving only in three days. They found feeding the dog difficult with a lack of food in the carriage. The Czechs jumped off at one stop to attempt to milk a cow in a nearby pasture to fill a baby's bottle for the dog, but they led some locals to believe they were seeking food for a baby, and so they were supplied with milk. This was repeated a further few times on the journey, each time they produced the bottle they would be given milk for the non-existent baby.Lewis (2013): pp. 55–56 From Montpellier, they changed trains to travel to Marseille where they boarded a boat to Gibraltar, where they arrived on 30 June.Lewis (2013): p. 57 =Flight from Gibraltar= The trip to Gibraltar was uneventful, and once they arrived they sought to board MV Northmoor which was due to join a convoy for England. The ferry to the cargo vessel refused to allow any dogs on board, with one of the guards claiming that they had refused a Colonel's dog earlier that day. Bozděch instead elected to trust Ant's recall ability; the airman boarded the ferry and left Antis on the shore. He went on board Northmoor before taking a ladder down the outside of the hull to a swimming platform where he called out for Ant. The dog swam across the to the ship, where Bozděch wrapped Ant in his greatcoat before being smuggled into Northmoor's hold.Lewis (2013): pp. 62–63 The duo spent most of the journey on Northmoor in the hold, where their Czech compatriots had created a sleeping area for them. The rest of the refugees spent their time on deck. However, Bozděch was concerned about their likelihood of survival in the event of a U-boat attack. The first attack came two days after the convoy left Gibraltar, resulting in the companying destroyers spreading out and dropping depth charges. The attack seemed to subside after a few hours, with man and dog staying below decks the whole time because of the risk of Ant's discovery if they went above decks. The submarine attack was followed up by a group of Junkers Ju 88s, when instead of remaining below decks, Bozděch took Ant up onto the upper deck; they were not discovered in the chaos. Northmoor was indirectly damaged by the action, as it developed an engine fault after steaming too fast and too long.Lewis (2013): pp. 66–68 The refugees were transferred to the cruise ship Neuralia, which had been taken into war service. The Czechs looked to smuggle Ant between the two ships by hiding him in a kit bag. This failed as the dog pushed his head out of the bag just as they were boarding – fortunately for Ant the new crew seemed happy to have a dog on-board and welcomed him. The facilities on Neuralia were much better than Northmoor, as the cabins remained fitted out as a cruise ship and Ant could stay in the cabin with the men.Lewis (2013): pp. 69–70 The remainder of the voyage went smoothly, until Bozděch was informed about the quarantine rules for dogs upon entering the United Kingdom. Having no money with which to pay for the quarantine fees, the Czechs sought once again to smuggle him – this time into the UK. They elected to hide Ant once again in a bag, this time mixed up in those being transferred as cargo by crane.Lewis (2013): pp. 71–73 They arrived at the docks in Liverpool on 12 July, where they successfully took Ant ashore. They were nearly found out by a pair of military police as they were at the train station nearby as they were on their way to Cholmondeley, Cheshire.Lewis (2013): pp. 76–78 Life When France surrendered to Germany, Bozděch and Antis moved to England to join No. 311 (Czechoslovak) Squadron RAF, based first at Speke, Liverpool, where Antis assisted in searching for survivors after an air raid, despite being wounded himself. A few months later, 311 Squadron was posted to RAF East Wretham in Norfolk and, despite regulations prohibiting Antis flying with Bozděch, he took part in around 30 missions. He became a mascot for the squadron as well as a personal pet, but stayed with Bozděch when he returned to his native Czechoslovakia after the war. When Bozděch had to flee Czechoslovakia again in 1948 from the growing persecution of army personnel who served on the side of western allies by the communists who recently gained power after the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état, Antis helped him escape, guiding him and several others around searchlights and the field of fire of a fixed machine gun position, and allowing them to cross safely into West Germany. Antis was formally recognised for his heroics in 1949, when he was awarded the Dickin Medal, which is frequently referred to as \\"the animal's Victoria Cross\\". Václav Bozděch became a British national two years later, in 1951, and Antis lived with him until he died around the age of 13–14. Legacy The first book to be written about Antis was Anthony Richardson's One Man and His Dog (1961), although several changes were made to his story such as Bozděch's first name becoming Jan. The airman had worked on the book with Richardson, and was dissatisfied with the result. There was talk at the time of the book being picked up as a film by 20th Century Fox, but it was never made.Lewis (2013): p. x Notes References  External links * PDSA Dickin Medal, including \\"Roll of Honor\\" PDF * British Pathe footage of Antis being awarded his Dickin Medal Category:German shepherds Category:Recipients of the Dickin Medal Category:Individual dogs Category:1953 animal deaths Category:Military animals of World War II Category:Royal Air Force personnel of World War II Category:Dogs in warfare ","title":"Antis (dog)"},{"id":"39890178","text":"Willow Shade, also known as the Willa Cather House, is a historic home located near Winchester, Frederick County, Virginia.

Gibson's original source material was The Story of My Life, the 1903 autobiography of Helen Keller. The play was adapted for the screen before, in 1962. The film is based on the life of Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan's struggles to teaching her. It starred Patty Duke (who played Helen Keller in the original 1962 film, for which she won the Oscar) as Annie Sullivan and Melissa Gilbert as Helen Keller. It produced a TV sequel, Helen Keller: The Miracle Continues in 1984.  Plot  Young Helen Keller (Melissa Gilbert), blind, deaf, and mute since infancy, is in danger of being sent to an institution. Her inability to communicate has left her frustrated and violent. In desperation, her parents seek help from the Perkins Institute, which sends them a \\"half-blind Yankee schoolgirl\\" named Annie Sullivan (Patty Duke) to tutor their daughter. Through persistence and love, and sheer stubbornness, Annie breaks through Helen's walls of silence and darkness and teaches her to communicate.

Early life Leonid Corneanu was born in the village of Coşniţa in the Tiraspolsky Uyezd of Kherson Governorate (present-day Dubăsari District, Moldova). He graduated from the pedagogical institute at Tiraspol, the Shevchenko literary institute at Kharkov (1932), and obtained a doctorate from the Moscow Institute of Philosophy, Literature and History. From 1936, he worked at the scientific institute of the Moldavian ASSR, and taught at the Tiraspol pedagogical institute. Poetic career Corneanu published his first poems in the journal Moldova literară in 1929, and a collection Versuri felurite (Various poems) the very next year. He used his birthname of Cornfeld for these publications. In 1933, Avânturi came out in Tiraspol. In 1939, he published Cântece şi poezii (Songs and poems). Corneanu published a book of poetry From the valley of the Dniester in 1947; there were posthumous collections Versuri (1965) and Poezii (1970). Novelistic and Dramatic Career Corneanu was one of the originators of children's literature in Moldova. Over a period of several years, he collected Moldovan folk songs, tales and idioms. In 1939, along with the composer David Herschfeld, he published the book Cântece norodnice moldoveneşti (Moldovan national songs, with annotations). In 1941 came out Proverbe, cimilituri şi expresii norodnice moldoveneşti (Moldovan folk songs and proverbs). Corneanu was in the Soviet army during the Second World War; upon demobilisation, he moved to Chișinău. Here he wrote a series of theatre pieces as well as musical comedies, which were then staged by various theatres in Moldova: În vaile Moldovâ (In the valleys of Moldavia, with Yakov Kutkovetsky, set to music by Eugen Coca, 1945), Fericirea Mărioarei (Maria's Fortune, with E. Gherken, set to music by Eugen Coca, 1951), Ileana's carpet (1953), Beyond the Blue Danube (1955), Izvorul frăţiei (The origin of brotherhood, 1956), The Bitterness of Love (1957). Several of his works were translated into Russian, and staged in theatres across the USSR. Film career In 1951, the director Boris Barnet made Lyana, a comedy written by Corneanu, the first feature film of the studio Moldova-Film. Translator Corneanu translated into the Moldovan language books by Taras Shevchenko, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Alexander Bezymensky, Demyan Bedny, as well as Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time. Controversies and Criticisms The compendium of folklore and folk songs Corneanu collected in the 1930s was seen even by his Communist colleagues as somewhat suspect. Despite the joy and gratitude to Soviet power overflowing in these songs, with collective farms, Soviet soldiers, Stakhanovites, tractor drivers and Stalin portrayed as the new heroes of the era, George Meniuc criticised their authenticity, albeit without addressing the reality of the themes of the folklore.Negura, p. 330 In 1949, Corneanu abandoned his wife and two daughters for a student of his. He was urged by the Communist party to return to his family, but he responded with confusing and conflicting statements: it was not he that left his wife, rather she left him; he loved the student, but at the same time he didn't want to divorce his wife because he was still attached to his family. For his 'dissolute conduct' and 'non-Bolshevik attitude of disrespect to the family', Corneanu was severely criticised by the Communists.Negura, p. 257 Bibliography #Versuri felurite, Tiraspol, 1930; #Tiraspolul, Tiraspol, 1932; #Avânturi, Tiraspol, 1933; #Pionierii în ţeh, Tiraspol-Balta, 1934; #Lumini şi umbre, Tiraspol, 1935; #Cântece şi poezii, Tiraspol, 1939; #Din Valea Nistrului, Chişinău, 1947; #Povestea lui Petrică, Chişinău, 1951; #Fericirea Mărioarei (în colaborare cu E.

The monastic disciples led by young Narendranath Datta understood the necessity to find out a new shelter. Narendranath and others decided to make dilapidated house at Baranagar the new math (monastery) for remaining disciples. The house belonged to a zaminder family of Taki, North 24 Parganas district. = Life at Baranagar Math = Group photo taken on 30 January 1887 in Baranagar Math, Kolkata.

Narendranath and his guru bhais used to collect their daily food by \\"holy begging\\" (madhukari). The math became the first building of the Ramakrishna Math—the monastery of the monastic order of Ramakrishna. Narendra later reminisced about the early days in the monastery:  Monastic vows  In January 1887, Narendranath Datta and eight other disciples of Ramakrishna took formal monastic vows at Baranagr Math. = Demolition in 1897 = The house, which was already in a dilapidated condition, crumbled down to dust in 1897. No initiative could be taken at that time to restore the house. In the same year Vivekananda returned from the West. = Formation of Baranagar Math Samrakshan Samity (1973) = On 25 January 1963, under the supervision and guidance of Swami Ramananda, a monk of Ramakrishna Order, the local people of Baranagar formed a society named \\"Baranagar Math Samrakshan Samity\\". The objective of the committee was to preserve the land where Baranagar Math was situated and attempt to re-establish it. In course of time, many buildings, shops and slums covered that area. Baranagar Math Samrakshan Samity managed to occupy a portion of the garden where Baranagar Math stood once. There they started social service activities like running Charitable Homoeopathic Dispensary, Free Coaching Centre (which was named Swami Vivekananda Charitable Coaching Centre) for the poor students of nearby slums etc. Gradually their social activities increased. They opened a non-formal school for children (which was named \\"Gadadhar Sishu Bikas Kendra\\"), opened a general library and started organising lectures and religious discourses on regular basis. = Handing over to the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission (2001) = In October 2001, Baranagar Math Samrakshan Samity handed over the land to the authority of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna mission. At that time Belur Math Management asked Baranagar's local Ramakrishna Mission Centre to take care of the possession. A meeting was held soon, where it was decided by the Governing Body and the Board of Trustees of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission to attempt to restore the place because of its historical significance. It was declared, since 6 January 2004 the place would be considered as an official branch of Belur Math. Swami Vamanananda was appointed as the president of the branch. Thus Baranagar Math came into existence once again. The development and re-establishment works are still going on.

It was commissioned by Peter the Great in 1724 and was led by Vitus Bering. Afield from 1725 to 1731, it was Russia’s first naval scientific expedition. It confirmed the presence of a strait (now known as Bering Strait) between Asia and America and was followed in 1732 by the Second Kamchatka Expedition. The expedition spent first two years, from January 1725 to January 1727, on traveling from Saint Petersburg to Okhotsk, using horses, dog sleds and river boats. After wintering in Okhotsk it moved to the mouth of the Kamchatka River on the east coast of the peninsula. In July–August 1728 it sailed north and then north-east along the shore, exploring Karaginsky Gulf, Kresta Bay, Providence Bay, Gulf of Anadyr, Cape Chukotsky and St. Lawrence Island. The expedition, as it turned out, went through the Bering Strait to the Chukchi Sea, and returned believing that it had completed its tasks. While it had not reached the North American coast, it provided evidence that Asia and North America are not connected. During 1729, it explored the southern shores of Kamchatka, mapping the Gulf of Kamchatka and Avacha Bay, and by 28 February 1730 returned via Okhotsk to St. Petersburg. The expedition was highly praised, with its leader Vitus Bering being promoted to captain- commander, his first noble rank, whereas his assistants Martin Spangberg and Aleksei Chirikov were made captains. It had been a long and expensive expedition, costing 15 men and souring relations between Russia and her native peoples, but it had provided useful insights into the geography of Eastern Siberia: in total the expedition surveyed more than 3500 km of the western coast of the sea, which was later named after Bering. Its maps of the area were later used by all Western European cartographers. Preparations On 29 December 1724 [N.S. 9 January 1725], Peter asked the Danish-Russian explorer Vitus Bering to command a voyage east. Peter instructed the expedition to do the following: * prepare one-two ships in Kamchatka or nearby; * using those ships, explore northern lands, which seemed to be part of America; * seek where those lands join America, and whether there are any cities in European possession in the area. When meeting European ships, it should inquire them the names of the local geographical features, explore the coasts on the way and map them. Preparations for the trip had begun some years before, but with his health rapidly deteriorating, Peter had hurried the process, and promoted the appointment of Bering as the expedition's leader ahead of the experienced cartographer K. P. von Verd. To his advantage Bering had knowledge of both the Indian Ocean and the eastern seaboard of North America, good personal skills and experience in transporting goods. His lieutenants for the journey were the hardened fellow Dane Martin Spangberg and the well-educated but relatively inexperienced Russian Aleksei Chirikov, a respected naval instructor. Chirikov, together with warrant officer Peter Chaplin co-wrote the expedition journal.Чаплин Петр Авраамович (биография). www.kamchatsky-krai.ru The assistants would receive annual salaries of some 180 roubles during the trip, whereas Bering would be paid 480. The natural route to Kamchatka was along tributaries of the Lena; but after the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689) this looked politically infeasible. Instead, Bering's party, it was decided, would travel over land and river from Saint Petersburg to Okhotsk, a small port town on Russia's eastern coast, and then by sea from Okhotsk to the Kamchatka peninsula, where they could start their voyage of exploration. Ships In 1725, the construction of a 20-meter-long ship named Fortuna (English: Fortune) began in Okhotsk in anticipation of the expedition. It was completed in June 1727 under the guidance of Chaplin, and by August, a ship of similar size, Vostok (English: East), was brought from Kamchatka and repaired. By the end of August 1727 both ships reached Kamchatka. During April–May 1728, one more ship, Archangel Gabriel, was built on Kamchatka from the local wood. Fortuna and Vostok were auxiliary ships used for transporting goods between Okhotsk and Bolsheretsk, whereas Archangel Gabriel was the main ship of Bering, and was armed with four cannons.Первая Камчатская экспедиция. ricolor.org St. Petersburg to Okhotsk On 24 January 1725, Chirikov departed with 26 of the 34-strong expedition along the well-traveled roads to Vologda, to the east. Having waited for the necessary paperwork to be completed, Bering and the remaining members of the expedition followed on 6 February. Bering was supplied with what few maps Peter had managed to commission in the preceding years. Both parties used horse-drawn sledges and made good time over the first legs of the journey. On 14 February they were reunited in Vologda and headed eastwards across the Ural mountains, arriving in Tobolsk (one of the main stopping points of the journey) on 16 March. They had already traveled over . At Tobolsk, Bering took on more men to help the party through the more difficult journey ahead. He asked for 24 more from the garrison, before upping the request to 54 after hearing that the ship the party required at Okhotsk (the Vostok) would need significant manpower to repair. In the end, the governor could spare only 39, but it still was a significant help. In addition, Bering wanted 60 carpenters and 7 blacksmiths; the governor responded that half of these would have to be taken on later, at Yeniseysk. After some delays preparing equipment and funds, on 14 May the now much enlarged party left Tobolsk, heading along the Irtysh. The journey ahead to the next major stopping point Yakutsk was well worn, but rarely by groups as large as Bering's, who had the additional difficulty of needing to take on more men as the journey progressed. As a result, the party ran behind schedule, reaching Surgut on 30 May and Makovsk in late June before entering Yeniseysk, where the additional men could be taken on; Bering would later claim that \\"few were suitable\\". In any case, the party left Yeniseysk on 12 August, desperately needing to make up lost time. On 26 September they arrived at Ilimsk, just three days before the river froze over. After the party had completely an trek to Ust-Kut, a town on the Lena where they could spend the winter, Bering traveled on to the town of Irkutsk both to get a sense of the conditions and to seek advice on how best to get their large party across the mountains separating Yakutsk (their next stop) to Okhotsk on the coast. After leaving Ust-Kut when the river ice melted in the spring of 1726, the party rapidly traveled down the River Lena, reaching Yakutsk in the first half of June. Despite the need for hurry and men being sent in advance, the governor was slow to grant them the resources they needed, prompting threats from Bering. On 7 July, Spangberg left with a detachment of 209 men and much of the cargo; on 27 July apprentice shipbuilder Fyodor Kozlov led a small party to reach Okhotsk ahead of Spangberg, both to prepare food supplies and to start work repairing the Vostok and building a new ship (the Fortuna) needed to carry the party across the bay from Okhotsk to the Kamchatka peninsula. Bering himself left on 16 August, while it was decided that Chirikov would follow the next spring with fresh supplies of flour. The journeys were as difficult as Bering had worried they would be. Men and horses died, and some men (46 from Bering's party alone) deserted with their horses and portions of the supplies as they struggled to build roads across difficult marshland and river terrain. While Bering's party (which reached Okhotsk in October) fared badly, Spangberg's did far worse. His heavily loaded boats could be tugged at no more than a day – and they had some to cover. When the rivers froze, the cargo was transferred to sleds and the expedition continued, enduring blizzards and waist-high snow. Even provisions left by Bering at Yudoma Cross could not fend off starvation. On 6 January 1727, Spangberg and two other men, who had together formed an advance party carrying the most vital items for the expedition, reached Okhotsk; ten days later sixty others joined them, although many were ill. Parties sent by Bering back along the trail from Okhotsk rescued seven men and much of the cargo that had been left behind. Okhotsk's inhabitants described the winter as the worst they could recall; Bering seized flour from the local villagers to ensure that his party too could take advantage of their stocks and consequently the whole village soon faced the threat of starvation. An advance party of Chirikov's division arrived in June 1727 with 27 tons of flour, resupplying the Bering's group, which by then had diminished in numbers. Okhotsk to Kamchatka and beyond The path of the First Kamchatka Expedition, by Vasily Berkh (Berg) (1781–1834) Map of Siberia compiled from the results of the First and Second Kamchatka Expeditions.Dukalskaya M. V. Первая Камчатская экспедиция . The Russian State Museum of Arctic and Antarctic. polarmuseum.ru The Vostok was readied and the Fortuna built at a rapid pace, with the first party (48 men commanded by Spangberg and comprising those required to start work on the ships that would have to be built in Kamchatka itself as soon as possible) leaving in June 1727. Chirikov arrived in Okhotsk soon after, bringing further supplies of food. He had had a relatively easy trip, losing no men and only 17 of his 140 horses. On 22 August, the remainder of the party sailed for Kamchatka. Had the route been charted, they should have sailed around the peninsula and made port on its eastern coast; instead, they landed on the west and made a grueling trip from the settlement of Bolsheretsk in the South-West, north to the Upper Kamchatka Post and then east along the Kamchatka River to the Lower Kamchatka Post. This Spangberg's party did before the river froze; next, a party led by Bering completed this final stint of approximately over land without the benefit of the river; and finally, in the spring of 1728, the last party to leave Bolsheretsk, headed by Chirikov, reached the Lower Kamchatka Post. The outpost was from St. Petersburg and the journey itself (the first time \\"so many [had] gone so far\\") had taken some three years. The lack of immediate food available to Spangberg's advance party slowed their progress, which hastened dramatically after Bering's and Chirikov's group arrived with provisions. As a consequence, the ship they constructed (named the Archangel Gabriel) was ready to be launched as soon as 9 June 1728 from its construction point upriver at Ushka. It was then fully rigged and provisioned by 9 July, and on 13 July set sail downstream, anchoring offshore that evening. On 14 July, Bering's party began their first exploration, hugging the coast in not a northerly direction (as they had expected) but a north-easterly one. Sailing further north, Bering entered for the first time the strait that would later bear his name. On 8 August, the expedition had a first meeting with the indigenous population. A boat of eight chukchi men approached the ship and asked the purpose of their visit. They refused to board the ship, but sent a delegate who swam to the ship on an air-filled balloon made from animal skin. The man told that there are islands nearby, and indeed, two days later the expedition reached an island, which Bering named St. Lawrence Island. In turn, Chirikov named the place of meeting the boat as Cape Chukotsky. After Cape Chukotsky, the land turned westwards, and Bering held a discussion with his lieutenants on 13 August 1728 whether they could reasonably claim it was turning westwards for good: that is to say, whether they had proven that Asia and America were separate land masses. The rapidly advancing ice prompted Bering to make the controversial decision not to deviate from his remit: the ship would sail for a few more days, but then turn back. The expedition was neither at the most easterly point of Asia (as Bering had supposed) nor had it succeed in discovering the Alaskan coast of America, which on a good day would have been visible to the east. As promised, on 16 August, Bering turned Archangel Gabriel around, heading back towards Kamchatka. On 31 August, the ship was hit by a severe storm and barely avoided crashing into the shore. After hasty repairs, on 2 September it reached the mouth of the Kamchatka River, fifty days after it had left. The mission was at its conclusion, but the party still needed to make it back to St. Petersburg to document the voyage (thus avoiding the fate of Semyon Dezhnyov who, unbeknownst to Bering, had made a similar expedition eighty years previously). In the spring of 1729, the Fortuna, which had sailed round the Kamchatka Peninsula to bring supplies to the Lower Kamchatka Post, now returned to Bolsheretsk; and shortly after, so did Archangel Gabriel. The delay was caused by a four-day journey that Bering made eastwards in search of North America, to no avail. By July 1729 the two vessels were back at Okhotsk, where they were moored alongside the Vostok; the party, no longer needing to carry shipbuilding materials made good time on the return journey from Okhotsk, and by 28 February 1730 Bering was back in the Russian capital. In December 1731 he was awarded 1000 roubles and promoted to captain-commander, his first noble rank, whereas Spangberg and Chirikov were made captains. It had been a long and expensive expedition, costing 15 men and souring relations between Russia and her native peoples, but it had provided useful insights into the geography of Eastern Siberia, and presented evidence that Asia and North America were separated by sea.

It connects Essen Hbf, Duisburg Hbf on the Rhine with Mönchengladbach on the Niers, Aachen and Heinsberg (sections of timetable routes 420, 425 and 485). Operations ET 425 set in Erkelenz station RB service in Aachen Central Station The service runs every hour between Essen and Aachen. In Lindern station between Mönchengladbach and Aachen, trains running from Aachen are uncoupled. The front section of the train continues as before running towards Mönchengladbach, while the rear section of the train is uncoupled and reverses to run towards Heinsberg. On the way back it is again coupled with a set coming from Mönchengladbach and continues as a coupled set towards Aachen. Class 425 and class 426 electric multiple units are usually used on the line as double sets. In exceptional cases (e.g. in case of problems with EMUS during the leaf-fall season) push–pull trains, consisting of Silberling carriages and a class 111 locomotive are used. The service is operated by DB Regio–Region NRW. History At first, the service only ran between Wesel or Duisburg and Mönchengladbach. It was created at the timetable change in December 2002 as an extension to Duisburg of the Mönchengladbach–Aachen section of the Grenzlandbahn (\\"border land railway\\"), which until then had started in Mönchengladbach, where it connected with the Rhein-Emscher-Express, and run via Aachen over the Cologne–Aachen railway to Köln Messe/Deutz station as route RB 21. This resulted in the following method of operations, which operated until December 2016. The line was formed of two hourly services, which were offset by about 30 minutes: #Wesel–Duisburg–Krefeld–Mönchengladbach #Duisburg–Krefeld–Mönchengladbach–Lindern–Aachen; this includes a portion that is worked between Heinsberg and Lindern. This meant there were services every 30 minutes on the section between Duisburg and Mönchengladbach. From December 2016 the Wesel–Duisburg–Krefeld–Mönchengladbach service has been operated as the Emscher-Niederrhein-Bahn (RB 35). The 1998 transport plan of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia and the resolution adopting it provided for the renaming of the Rhine-Nier-Bahn. It would operate from 2015 on the Wesel–Duisburg section as S-Bahn line S 20, which would continue from Duisburg towards Düsseldorf. On the Wickrathberg–Duisburg section, the Rhine-Nier-Bahn would from no later than 2015 run as the S 21, which would continue from Duisburg to Kamen. There was no provision in the plan for adoption of the Aachen–Wickrathberg section into the S-Bahn network. These plans were not implemented. On 1 March 2008, the AVV published the Zukunftskonzept 2015 (future concept 2015), which envisaged the Rhein-Niers-Bahn (RB 33) being operated from both Duisburg and Mönchengladbach and Heinsberg to Aachen via Lindern. Thus, the Rhein-Niers-Bahn would take over operations on the Heinsberg–Lindern railway, with services to be operated by Euregiobahn under contract. The final plans ultimately provided for portion working, in which two units of class 425 sets running from Aachen in double traction would be uncoupled. This concept was finally implemented at the timetable change on 15 December 2013. The existing stop in Kohlscheid station was deleted with the introduction of the new timetable. However, the stop at Kohlscheid station was restored at the timetable change on 13 December 2015 at the request of many customers. Since the timetable change on 11 December 2016, a double set consisting of a class 425 (running to Duisburg) and a class 426 (running to Heinsberg) has been used as a rule. The Rhein-Niers-Bahn was extended to Essen Hauptbahnhof via Mülheim on 15 December 2019. Route The Regionalbahn service runs over the full length of the following railway lines: *the Duisburg-Ruhrort–Mönchengladbach railway, *the Aachen–Mönchengladbach railway and *the Lindern–Heinsberg railway. The former northern section of the line also operated over: *the Oberhausen–Arnhem railway between Wesel and Oberhausen, *the Duisburg–Dortmund railway between Oberhausen and Duisburg and *the Dortmund–Duisburg railway between Duisburg and Essen.

In the game, the player controls an Escher-like character and the rotation of the 2D environment, which affects gravity based on the changing orientation of the landscape.  Gameplay  The game consists of various levels, the goal of which is to get the main character to the exit door. The game's puzzles are inspired by the art of M. C. Escher and like his artworks, each level unfolds in grayscale with hand-drawn illustrations. The player can rotate the world using the arrow keys, changing the gravitational direction of individual objects, or control the main character with A and D to go left and right. The Wii U version utilizes the GamePad touch and accelerometer. The player can use the Wii U GamePad touch capabilities to interact with the world to move the character, open doors, activate objects, and interact with the menu system and UI. The player can also tilt the Wii U GamePad to rotate gravity in the game.  Plot  The game opens with the nameless main character sleeping under an apple tree. After an apple hits him in the head and wakes him up, he is guided to his house with three doors, behind which lie further doors and levels. The story is explained through the environment and post-world text as the game progresses.  Reception  The Bridge received positive reviews from critics. It has an aggregate score of 74/100 on Metacritic. The game won the 2012 Indie Game Challenge award for Achievement in Art Direction and Achievement in Gameplay.

Built in the 1830s, regular services were held at the Episcopal church for almost 100 years. The building has been restored twice, once after being heavily damaged during the Civil War, and again in the 1960s. The church was added to the Virginia Landmarks Register (VLR) and the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1973. History The congregation of St. Thomas Episcopal Church was established in 1834, becoming the seventh Episcopal church founded in Frederick County. The congregation, which included the Hite family of the nearby Belle Grove Plantation, raised the necessary funds and began construction of a church building on a lot purchased for fifty dollars. The church was completed sometime around April 1837. The church served as a military hospital for wounded Confederate soldiers during the Civil War. (The congregation worshiped temporarily at the nearby Grace Methodist Church.) In 1864, Union general Philip Sheridan's troops arrived in the area. The Union soldiers removed the wounded Confederate troops from the church hospital and converted the building into a stable. The Union troops later broke out the windows, burned the pews, and burned window shutters. Only the four walls of the building were left standing once they were done. After the war, the Federal government paid for some of the repairs to the church. This, along with contributions from church members, resulted in the church being reopened in 1867. Throughout the next several decades a small congregation worshiped at St. Thomas Episcopal Church with approximately thirty people in attendance. Services regularly took place at the church until 1930 and on an occasional basis until 1945. The church building had deteriorated by that point and was abandoned the following year. The Episcopal Diocese of Virginia retained the property for several years before transferring ownership to Christ Episcopal Church in Winchester. In 1966, the church was given to Middletown's government to be used \\"as a chapel, museum or for any good moral purpose.\\" The name of the building was changed to St. Thomas Church in 1967 to reflect it becoming an interfaith facility. A group of citizens founded the St. Thomas Chapel Trust and restored the building in the 1960s. Work included the installation of central heating and electricity, the restoration of the original organ and pews, laying a new floor, replacing the windows, and restoring the steeple and bell tower. St. Thomas was added to the VLR on January 16, 1973, and the NRHP on April 11, 1973. The building is also designated a contributing property to the Middletown Historic District, listed on the NRHP in 2003. Architecture The building is a one-story, stepped gable-roofed, three bay by three bay church in the Gothic Revival style. It measures by and the recessed chancel measures by . The exterior is made of the original stucco, coursed ashlar, and brick, while the foundation is made of brick and stone. The standing seam metal roof is flanked on either end by parapet walls. The cupola is made of wood and features Gothic style vents, an octagonal belfry with Gothic arches, pyramidal roof, and a wooden cross.

It is within the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome of North America, in northern areas of the United States' states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota, and southern areas of the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba. Setting The Western Great Lakes forests, in large part, lie in the northwestern Great Lakes Basin near the shores of Lake Huron, Lake Michigan and Lake Superior, including the entire Upper peninsula of Michigan and large parts of Northern Wisconsin, around Lake Superior into much of northern Minnesota and a smaller section into Canada. In the west, the ecoregion surrounds the lakes and rivers that divide Minnesota from Ontario, including Lake of the Woods and Rainy River, and it extends near the Winnipeg River into southeastern Manitoba. This region has warm summers and cold, snowy winters. This region is generally similar in climate and condition to the Eastern forest-boreal transition to its east, except that it is generally somewhat drier (the prevailing winds blow west to east and drier air from the plains comes here first before it picks up moisture over the lakes) and, especially in its southern and central areas, its soil is much thicker and less acidic, which makes for more varied vegetation. Flora This ecoregion is a transition area between the taiga (Boreal forest) to the north and the temperate deciduous forest and tallgrass prairie to the south and west and thus contains a variety of habitats including northern coniferous forests, northern hardwood forest, boreal hardwood-conifer forest, swamp forest, and peatland, in addition to freshwater marshes, bogs, fens, and hardwood river basins and conifer swamps, and large hardwood and conifer stands. Trees of the woodland include white pine and red pine (Pinus resinosa) with paper birch (Betula papyrifera) and aspen, and jack pine (Pinus banksiana) forests, red pine, oak (Quercus spp.), and hazel (Corylus cornuta). \\"Common species of the northern hardwoods include sugar maple (Acer saccharum), red maple (Acer rubrum), American beech (Fagus grandifolia), hop hornbeam (Ostrya virginiana), basswood (Tilia americana), yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis)\\" and Northern pin oak (Quercus ellipsoidalis). Fauna The Western Great Lakes forests are very rich in wildlife. Wildlife \\"include moose (Alces alces), black bear (Ursus americanus), wolf (Canis lupus), lynx (Lynx canadensis), snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and woodchuck (Marmota monax). Bird species include ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus), hooded merganser (Lophodytes cucullatus), pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus), bald eagle (Haleaeetus leucocephalus), turkey vulture (Cathartes aura), herring gull (Larus argentatus), and waterfowl. American black duck (Anas rubripes) and wood duck (Aix sponsa) occur in the eastern part of the ecoregion.\\" Threats and use While the area does now have large protected sections, historically logging (especially of pine wood) has changed many sections and continues today. Agricultural development, especially orchards in Lower Michigan has also reduced the habitat. In addition, the establishment of roads and lakeside homes significantly impacts the forests.

A non-Thoroughbred horse who excelled at sprint distances and carried big weights to victory in major handicap races, he has been described as Britain's \\"greatest handicapper and second best sprinter\\" of the 20th century. Background Irish Elegance was large, powerful, exceptionally good-looking chestnut with white socks on his hind legs bred by A Frogley and foaled on 7 March 1915. He was not a Thoroughbred: his damsire Clorane was descended from a \\"half-bred\\" mare whose ancestry was not recorded in the General Stud Book. His sire, Sir Archibald, won the New Stakes and finished second in the 2000 Guineas. His dam Sweet Clorane also produced Cloringo, a steeplechaser who won the National Hunt Chase Challenge Cup at Cheltenham in 1926. The colt was sent into training with Harry Cottrill who trained at Tarporley in Cheshire before moving south to Foxhill, Wiltshire in 1919. Irish Elegance was named after a variety of tea rose. As a two-year-old, Irish Elegance did not race but showed considerable promise in training. He was bought for £2000 by Mr Thorburn, who later sold him for £9000 to the financier James White. Racing career =1918: three-year-old season= In June 1918, Irish Elegance ran at Newmarket in the Cambridgeshire Hunt Cup, a wartime substitute race for Royal Ascot's Royal Hunt Cup, and won \\"in a canter\\" by two lengths in a time of 1:24.8. He then won the July Cup over six furlongs at Newmarket. In October he finished third of the twenty-two runners behind Zinovia and Dansellon in the Cambridgeshire Handicap, apparently failing to stay the nine furlong distance. =1919: four-year-old season= On 14 June 1919, Irish Elegance won the Salford Borough Handicap by six lengths under a weight of 135 pounds. Four days later he carried 137 pounds in the Royal Hunt Cup against 25 opponents. The Royal Ascot meeting on 1919 was said to mark a \\"revival of pre-war splendour\\", with a record crowd which included King George V and Queen Mary. Irish Elegance started joint-favourite with the King's horse Jutland and won easily after leading from the start, setting a record for the highest weight ever carried to victory in the race. At Goodwood Racecourse on 29 July he was assigned a weight of 142 pounds in the Stewards' Cup and finished second to King Sol. Irish Elegance was beaten three-quarters of a length by the winner, to whom he was conceding forty-four pounds and appeared to be a rather unlucky loser, having lost ground at the start. By this time he was acknowledged as the best horse in England at distances up to a mile and \\"the most famous horse of the era\\". On 12 September he carried 142 pounds in the Portland Handicap at Doncaster Racecourse. He took the lead a furlong from the finish and drew clear of the field in the closing stages to win very easily by three lengths. After this performance, he was described as \\"not only the fastest horse of the present generation, but probably the fastest there has been\\". His rider, the Australian Brownie Carslake said \\"I have never ridden a horse like Irish Elegance. He gives his rider a grand feel. His action is of the smoothest, as he swings along in a stride that is almost effortless.\\" Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris retrospectively rated Irish Elegance the best horse foaled anywhere in the world in 1915, ahead of The Derby winner Gainsborough. He was also rated the second-best British or Irish-trained sprinter of the 20th century behind Abernant. Stud record Irish Elegance was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion, starting at a fee of 200 guineas, despite his non-Thoroughbred status. He was an almost total failure as a sire of winners and struggled to attract top-class mares. One of his daughters, Elegant Girl was the grand-dam of the Champion Hurdle winner Doorknocker. Irish Elegance was euthanised in February 1940.

It began commercial service on 6 February 2013 during the Spring Festival. Puyuma Express was commissioned by the TRA in order to upgrade the Taiwanese rail system. As the mountains of Taiwan are a barrier to coast-to-coast transportation, motor travel is prone to congestion. The high speed and capacity of the service helps to alleviate this problem. Puyuma Express also increases passenger capacity on TRA. The maximum operational speed of Puyuma Express is , making it the fastest service of TRA. Puyuma Express belongs to the Tze-chiang limited express class of TRA services in terms of fares; however, it is a reservation-only service similarly to the Taroko express, with no standing passengers allowed. Naming The name \\"Puyuma\\" means \\"together\\" and \\"united\\" in the Puyuma language spoken by the Puyuma people of eastern Taiwan. It was chosen after a naming contest that was open to the public. History The trains were imported to Taiwan in 2012; since 2013, they have been running between Hualien and Taipei, on the existing narrow gauge tracks of the winding Yilan Line, where they reduced traveling time between the two cities from 3 hours down to about 2 hours. On 28 February 2013, the TRA announced that Taitung would become a destination on the Puyuma Express with official operations beginning 16 July 2014, in concord with the completion of electrification of the Taitung Line. Rolling stock Puyuma Express services use TEMU2000 tilting electrical multiple unit series purpose- built by Nippon Sharyo. TRA purchased a total of 152 TEMU2000 cars for 19 trains.

He studied at the University of Tartu in 1841–1847, where he befriended Leopold von Schrenck and Karl Maximovich, as well as Karl Ernst von Baer. Ditmar began studying agricultural science but after some time changed to mineralogy and geology under Otto Wilhelm Hermann von Abich and Hermann Martin Asmuss.

In 1848 he returned to Russia and Saint Petersburg, and through his friendship with Leopold von Schrenck was introduced to Alexander von Middendorff at the Imperial Academy of Sciences. In 1851 Ditmar undertook a voyage to Kamchatka which would last until 1854, and there undertook important scientific investigations.

Árni was born in 1304, the son of Lárentíus Kálfsson and his Norwegian concubine Þuríðr Árnadóttir af Borgundi. His biography is known largely from Einarr Hafliðason's biography of Lárentíus, Laurentius saga. After spending his childhood in Norway, Árni joined his father in Icelandic in 1315 and in 1317, Árni and his father became monks at the monastery of Þingeyraklaustur, alongside the translator Bergr Sokkason, whose prose style seems to have influenced Árni's.Dunstanus Saga, ed. by C. E. Fell, Editiones Arnamagnaeanae, Series B, 5 (Copenhagen: Reitzel, 1963), pp. lix-lxiv (p. lxiv); Peter Hallberg, 'Some Observations on the Language of Dunstanus saga, with an Appendix on the Bible Compilation Stjórn,' Saga-Book of the Viking Society, 18, 324–353 http://www.vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/Saga-Book%20XVIII.pdf. Árni was consecrated by Jón Halldórsson, bishop of Skálholt, around 1325, and subsequently worked for his father, who by then was the bishop of Hólar. After this point, Árni's biography becomes obscure: it seems that Árni's behaviour won the disapproval of both his father and his father's biographer. It seems from a letter of 1337 sent from the monastery at Nidaros to Petrus Filipsson that Árni was at that time back in Norway and was seeking to work as a Dominican preacher in Jämtland. No more is known of Árni's activities. Árni can be said to have been part of the North Icelandic Benedictine School, and to have been 'among the most productive, if not the most productive, scribes both in the north of Iceland and in Iceland as a whole'.Joanna A. Skórzewska, Constructing a Cult: The Life and Veneration of Guðmundr Arason (1161–1237) in the Icelandic Written Sources, The Northern World, 51 (Leiden: Brill, 2011), p. 229. In the words of Laurentius saga, 'var bróðir Árni hinn bezti klerkr ok versificator, ok kenndi mörgum klerkum' ('Brother Árni was the best scholar and poet, and taught many scholars').Cited in Dunstanus Saga, ed. by C. E. Fell, Editiones Arnamagnaeanae, Series B, 5 (Copenhagen: Reitzel, 1963), pp. lix-lxiv (p. lxi). He was the author of Dunstanus saga, perhaps fairly early in his ecclesiastical career: in Fell's analysis, 'the enthusiasm and carelessness of the writing, the eagerness to display irrelevant knowledge, and the uncertain hovering between precise translation and rhetorical flourish, suggest that the Dunstanus Saga was an early work, and may even have been an experimental one'.Dunstanus Saga, ed. by C.

Five people, including two Buddhist monks, were injured by the blasts. Three other devices were defused by bomb-disposal squads at a number of locations in Gaya. The temple itself and the Bodhi Tree (where Gautama Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment) were undamaged. However, the Archaeological Survey of India confirmed damage to new structures in the temple complex. International figures, including the Dalai Lama, Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Myanmar Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, condemned the attacks. On 4 November 2013, the National Investigation Agency announced that the Islamic terrorist group Indian Mujahideen was responsible for the bombings. On 1 June 2018, a special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court of Patna sentenced life imprisonment for 5 prime accused in this case. Bombings The Mahabodhi Mahavihara is an important temple for Buddhists worldwide. The bombs exploded between 05:30 and 06:00 IST (00:30–01:00 UTC), concurrently with the Sutta chanting and meditation which begin the daily routine of the mahavihara. Four of the blasts occurred within the Mahabodhi Temple complex: *The first bomb exploded at 5:30 IST, during prayers in the temple sanctuary. *About two minutes later a bomb exploded on the east side of the complex, at the Animesh Lochna Temple. Wooden bookshelves, stacked with Buddhist scriptures, were damaged by this blast. *A third bomb exploded on the south side of the complex, at the Butter Lamp House. This blast damaged the Bodhgaya Temple Management Committee (BTMC) ambulance parked there. *A fourth bomb exploded on the north side of the complex, inside a small shrine; however, an image of the Buddha in the shrine was unaffected by the blast. Five other blasts occurred in Bodh Gaya, within a 500-metre radius of the Mahabodhi Temple complex: *A small bomb exploded at an statue of the Buddha. *Three bombs exploded at the Tergar (Tibetan) Monastery. One bomb was placed behind the door of a classroom where children study Buddhism. The windows and classroom doors were damaged; there were no injuries, since the children were on holiday. *One bomb exploded on a bus parked at the Sujata bypass. Indian Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde said on 8 July that there were ten blasts, not nine as earlier reported; it was unclear where the tenth bomb detonated. Despite the blasts, BTMC monks opened the main sanctuary of the temple for routine prayer and rituals. Bomb- disposal squads defused three more bombs, which did not explode because the analog timers in them failed. A cylinder bomb at the Tergar monastery, another bomb near the 80-foot statue of the Buddha, and a third bomb was found during the afternoon, near the Royal Residence Hotel in the village of Baiju Bigaha. The bomb-detection team separated the detonator from the power source to defuse these bombs: Three pamphlets, handwritten in Urdu, were reportedly found with the defused bombs. Code words in two of the pamphlets seemed to describe the locations where the bombs would be planted, while the third pamphlet included the phrase \\"Revenge for Iraq\\". Investigation On 8 July the Bihar Police released CCTV footage of the blast sites at the Mahabodhi Temple and, based on an analysis of the footage, sketches of the suspected attackers. Sahidur and Saifur Rehman, brothers from Scotland and Saudi Arabia respectively, were identified from the sketches; both are alleged Indian Mujahideen (IM) operatives. Another man, Vinod Mistri, was also arrested since his identity card was found at the blast site. However, Mistri claimed to have lost his card days before the blasts. National Investigation Agency (NIA) released Mistri on 10 July for lack of evidence after taking his statement. An alleged IM tweet claimed responsibility for the Bodh Gaya bombings on the day of the blasts, warning that Mumbai would be the next target. The IP address was traced to Pakistan, and NIA investigated the claim. On 16 July, NIA released the sketches and a video clip of a suspect in the bombings. According to the agency, the suspect (in Bhikkhu clothing) planted four bombs in the Mahabodhi complex. Witnesses noticed that the suspect performed Parikrama incorrectly. NIA reported that the suspected bomber intended to blow up the main statue of the Buddha, but did not enter the sanctuary because prayers had already begun. Investigators discovered that the 13 Lotus timers used in the bombings were bought at a shop in Guwahati. They also ascertained that the clocks attached to the unexploded bombs were manufactured at a factory in Rajkot, Gujarat. The cylinders attached to the bombs were obtained in Bihar, so NIA suspected local involvement. Investigators also confirmed that the bombs used in Patna and Bodh Gaya were nearly identical; one of the many similarities investigated was in the way the bombs were planted. On 4 November 2013 NIA raided a lodge in Ranchi, finding evidence of a plot to bomb pilgrimage sites. The evidence included a map of planned bombings and the coded names of the terrorists. An NIA agent confirmed that \\"the charts they recovered matched precisely\\". The evidence confirmed that the Ranchi cell of the IM was responsible for the blasts. According to reports, Imtiaz Ansari placed a bomb near the Thai Monastery and Ainul (a.k.a. Tariq) placed one at the Tergar Monastery. Mujib placed bombs at four locations in Bodh Gaya. The six-person attacking squad allegedly worked in pairs, and was assigned to place three bombs each. NIA named the five bomb planters, who planned the attack over a year ago: Hyder Ali, Imtiaz Ansari, Tariq (a.k.a. Ainul) and Taufeeq and Mujibal Ansari. The agency suspects that Ali masterminded the plot with guidance from Tehseen Akhtar, a Ranchi-based IM operative. Investigators suspect that Riyaz Bhatkal, a Pakistani IM leader, commanded the attack. =Alleged warnings= Some members of the media blamed the Bihar Police, saying the blasts resulted from a lack of security at the management and operational levels. The metal detectors at the Mahabodhi Temple were not calibrated to detect bombs, and there were only four guards on duty when the blasts occurred. A security expert said, \\"The decision to let the Bodh Gaya Management Committee man security inside the premises is preposterous and immature\\". Questioned by NIA in the US in June 2010 about the 2008 Mumbai attacks, David Headley claimed that Lashkar-e-Taiba prepared a video on the Mahabodhi Temple and was planning to trigger blasts there. The IM, responsible for the 2012 Pune bombings, revealed plans to attack the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya in October 2012. In April 2013 the NIA issued a list of alleged IM operatives, including Gaya-born Amir Reza Khan (alias Parvez, alias Rizwan, alias Muttaki), a resident of the village of Maheyan in Mohanpur, Gaya who was the sixth wanted member of the list. Reza, perpetrator of the Bangalore and Pune blasts, is suspected to have provided reconnaissance on the Mahabodhi Temple site. The Intelligence Bureau (IB) issued several warnings, one in 2012 and two in 2013. The Bihar Police were alerted in June 2013 about the targets by the IB, and on 2 July the IB alerted them about the entry of two suspects into Gaya. The Ministry of Home Affairs warned on 3 July that the temple was a target. The warnings caused a Bihar Police meeting the same day about security at the Mahabodhi Temple, but the blasts occurred within 100 hours. The treasurer of All India Bhiku Sangha, Pragya Deep, said: \\"The administration had prior information. There was a report of the IB. A series of security review meetings have been conducted. There have been at least five to six meetings. It’s shameful that despite this, the blasts have taken place. This is a mistake on the part of the administration\\". After the blast, Chief Minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar said: \\"The government had always been on the alert and taken steps to ensure the security of the Mahabodhi temple and Bodh Gaya in general\\". A senior official of the IB said, \\"The Bodh Gaya temple was a long standing target and we had been reminding the Bihar state agencies about it. But our warnings were not taken seriously\\". Reactions Indian President Pranab Mukherjee called the blasts a \\"senseless act of violence targeting innocent pilgrims and monks who had gathered to worship at this temple dedicated to the great apostle of peace—Gautama Buddha\\". Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh condemned the incident, saying that India's \\"composite culture and traditions teach us respect for all religions and such attacks on religious places will never be tolerated\\". A national organisation of Buddhist monks, the All India Bhiku Sangha, also reacted to the attacks. Its chairperson, Bhante Sadanand Mahasthaver, said: \\"Buddhist monks all over the country feel saddened by the attack. The international community is also shaken. We try to put people on the right path and we have been made the target of an attack. The All India Bhiku Sangha condemns this attack. This should not have happened. We spread the message of peace across the world. This is an attempt to spread terror and create discord among the messengers of peace\\". The Rajya Sabha condemned the attacks on Mahabodhi Temple; Chairman Mohammad Hamid Ansari described the attacks as \\"senseless act of violence\\" and \\"a cause of anguish and deep concern to all\\". The Government of Bihar proposed to establish an Anti Terrorist Squad unit in the state after the bombings. The 14th Dalai Lama called the attack \\"unfortunate\\". Lobsang Sangay, Prime Minister of the Tibetan government-in-exile, said: \\"I am deeply saddened to learn about the series of bomb blasts at Mahabodhi Temple. My prayers [are] for the injured and their family members\\". Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje said he was \\"saddened to hear of the senseless violence\\" and asked Buddhists \\"to remain calm and refrain from any further escalation of the violence\\".The 17th Gyalwang Karmapa’s message on the Bodh Gaya Bombing, Tibet Post, 8 July 2013 Karmapa Trinley Thaye Dorje said he was \\"deeply saddened to hear of the bomb attacks\\", and prayed \\"that we are all able to respond with compassion to all those affected by this tragic event\\". Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa was shocked by the news of the explosions: \\"[i]t is with deep sadness that I condemn the explosions within the hallowed precincts of the most venerated and sacred Bodh Gaya shrine in Bihar in India. Undoubtedly, it is one of the holiest shrines highly respected and venerated not only by Buddhists throughout the world, but by all peace-loving human beings\\". Burmese government and opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi expressed her unhappiness over the blasts. The Government of Thailand was \\"deeply disturbed by the bomb explosions\\", voicing security concerns. Delegates from a number of Buddhist traditions at the Eighth Global Conference on Buddhism in Singapore passed a resolution on the bombings: > \\"We are deeply saddened, but we forgive those responsible for bombing the > Mahabodhi Temple in Bodhgaya. You may damage the most important temple in > Buddhism but you will not destroy our faith in forgiveness and compassion\\". The Northeast Indian Bhikkhu Sangha and Buddhists submitted a memorandum to the Prime Minister of India: \\"It is indeed a sad incident that miscreants tried to cause damage to one of the holiest Buddhist shrines which is not only the place of Buddha’s enlightenment but from where the message of love and compassion pervaded the entire universe. The Mahabodhi Mahavihara, also being a World Heritage Site, is venerated by the world Buddhist community and such acts of vandalism deserve our strongest words of disapproval. We condemn the dastardly act and request the Government to deal with such anti social elements with a strong hand so that such acts of mindless violence do not occur again in any place of worship of any religious denomination\\". In Nagpur during a protest, Buddhist monk Bodhi Priya Vinay tried to immolate himself but was stopped by police. Buddhist monks from Thailand, Laos, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Sri Lanka, including the World Fellowship of Buddhists, condemned the Gaya attacks. Throughout India, protestors led peace rallies and bandhs against the Bodh Gaya bombings. World Council of Churches general secretary Olav Fykse Tveit expressed \\"heartfelt sorrow and solidarity\\" over the bombings. In a letter to the Buddhist community, he said: \\"We wish and hope that this incident, despite its traumatic and tragic dimensions, may be transformed into an opportunity to offer the world a glimpse of the best of your morality and spirituality\\".

Biography Bartholomew was the son of George I Ghisi and Alice dalle Carceri. His father died at the Battle of the Cephissus against the Catalan Company in 1311. As Bartholomew was underage, his mother assumed the regency while he was still minor, until her own death two years later. By 11 June 1315, Bartholomew II Ghisi was in direct control of his domains. From his father, Bartholomew inherited the lordship of Tinos, Mykonos, and parts of Kea and Serifos in the Duchy of Naxos, and from his mother one of the triarchies of Euboea (according to Raymond-Joseph Loenertz the central triarchy of Chalkis), while his father's other possession by his first wife, the Barony of Chalandritsa in the Principality of Achaea, returned to a member of the Dramelay family, Nicholas of Dramelay. At some unspecified date, Batholomew married a daughter of the Grand Constable of Achaea, Engilbert of Liederkerque, and had a son, George II Ghisi. From 1317 to 1327 Bartholomew and his fellow triarchs, backed by the Venetians, confronted the Catalans of the Duchy of Athens for the domination in Euboea. In spring 1317, Andrea Corner, ruler of one sixth of Euboea, allowed 2,000 Catalans entry into the city of Chalkis. The Catalans were expelled from the city following the intervention of Venice, but the situation on the island remained complicated following the death of Boniface of Verona, lord of Karystos. His daughter, Marulla of Verona, disputed Boniface's inheritance with her half-brother Thomas. Marulla was married with the Catalan leader Alfonso Fadrique, whose men occupied the disputed castles. Venetian mediation led to the signing of a truce of all involved parties on 19 June 1319; Bartholomew signed it along with the Venetian Bailo of Negroponte, Francesco Dandolo, John de Noyer de Maisey, triarch of the southern third of Euboea, Pietro dalle Carceri and Andrea Corner, lords of the two northern sixths of the island, and Alfonso Fadrique for the Catalans. Bartholomew later came to hold the post of Grand Constable of the Principality of Achaea as well, probably through his marriage, although he does not appear to have had lands in the principality. He held this post in 1320, when the Byzantine governor of Mystras, Andronikos Asen, invaded the territory of Achaea. As a vassal of the Prince of Achaea, Bartholomew Ghisi participated in the army sent against the Byzantines, but in a battle on 9 September at the castle of Saint George, he was taken prisoner, along with several high-ranking nobles of the Principality, and was sent to Constantinople. He remained captive for some years and was released in 1325, although on 11 May 1321 he appears among the signatories of a new truce with the Catalans in Chalkis. In 1326/27, he reached a rapprochement with the Catalans, sealed by the marriage of his son George II to Simona of Aragon, daughter of the Catalan vicar-general Alfonso Fadrique. Bartholomew received—probably as Simona's dowry—half the castellany of the Castle of Saint Omer in Thebes, which he held until its destruction in c. 1331/34. This pro- Catalan attitude led to remonstrances by Venetian officials. At the same time (1326/27) he had a conflict for unknown reasons with the Duke of Naxos Nicholas I Sanudo and was therefore condemned by the Venetian bailo of Negroponte, who confiscated some of his goods while his wife was imprisoned (by the bailo or Sanudo). The affair was judged several times at Venice but its final outcome remains unknown; however Bartholomew must have regained his standing with Venice since he was included in its truce with the Catalans in 1331. In 1328, Bartholomew and his brother Marino sold their share of Kea (half the island) to Ruggiero Premarin. In 1331/32, Bartholomew reverted to an hostile attitude toward the Catalans (perhaps partly because of the dismissal of Alfonso Fadrique from the post of vicar-general) and backed Walter VI of Brienne in his abortive attempt to enforce his ancestral claims on the Duchy of Athens. It was precisely in order to avoid the Castle of Saint Omer falling in Brienne's hands that the Catalans destroyed it. According to the prologue of the French version of the Chronicle of the Morea, it derives from a prototype that Bartholomew held at the Castle of Saint Omer. It is therefore likely that Bartholomew owned be the original version of the Chronicle, whose versions in various languages are the major primary source about the history of Frankish Greece. Bartholomew II Ghisi died in 1341.

She was a daughter of Prince David of Kakheti and, by virtue of her marriages to Bagrat IV and Archil, a queen consort of Imereti, a kingdom in western Georgia (1660–1661, 1678–1679, 1690–1691, 1695–1696, and 1698), and of Kakheti (1668–75). In 1684 she accompanied her husband Archil in exile in Russia, where she was known as Tsaritsa Catherine of Imereti (, Ekaterina Davydovna Imeretinskaya). She died in Moscow at the age of 71.  Early life and first marriage  Ketevan was a daughter of Crown Prince David of Kakheti and his wife, Elene Diasamidze. She was a granddaughter of King Teimuraz I of Kakheti on her father's side and grandniece of the catholicos of the Georgian Orthodox Church Eudemus I on her mother's side. Her father was killed in a battle with the Persians and their loyal Georgian nobles the same year she was born. Ketevan was reared by her aunt, Darejan, a consort of King Alexander III of Imereti. After Alexander's death on 1 March 1660, Darejan made all efforts to bring his heir and her step-son Bagrat V under her influence, marrying him to her niece Ketevan three days after Alexander's funeral. With Darejan unwilling to give up power, the tensions rose in the royal family. The queen dowager persuaded Bagrat to divorce Ketevan and suggested to the king that he should now marry her. As Bagrat rejected the offer, he was captured and blinded on Darejan's order. Darejan then married a local nobleman, Vakhtang Tchuchunaishvili, and made him king. The coup inaugurated nearly a century of anarchy in Imereti, which left the country in ruins.  Second and third marriages  After her divorce from Bagrat, Ketevan was married to Prince Gogoberidze. In 1661, Darejan, beleaguered by enemies from all sides, appealed to Vakhtang V of Kartli for help, offering her niece Ketevan for Vakhtang V's son Archil, and her throne to Vakhtang himself. The deal did not materialize and Darejan, her husband Vakhtang, and Ketevan found themselves in captivity of the Ottoman pasha of Akhaltsikhe in Oltu. When in 1663 Archil, son of Vakhtang V, was deposed in Imereti and sent to Persia for confirmation as king of Kakheti, he decided to marry Ketevan in order to assert his claim to Imereti. Vakhtang V paid 20,000 silver kuruş to ransom Ketevan from the pasha. Archil, then king of Kakheti, wed Ketavan in Tbilisi on 22 March 1668. In 1675, Archil, at odds with the Persian grand vizier Shaykh Ali Khan Zanganeh, left Kakheti and launched a series of attempts to establish himself in Imereti. By 1699, Archil gave up all hopes of reclaiming Imereti and finally settled down in Russia, whose government had first granted him and his family asylum in 1686.  Later life and death  The couple's life in Russia was further marred in 1711 by the death of their last surviving son, Prince Alexander, who, a Russian artillery commander, had fallen in the hands of the victorious Swedes at Narva in 1700. On Archil's death in Moscow in 1713, with no surviving male children, Ketevan succeeded him as a steward of the estates granted upon the Georgian family by the Russian government, such as Vsekhsvyatskoye in the Moscow Governorate and Lyskovo in the Nizhny Novgorod Governorate. She died in Moscow on 16 April 1719 and was buried weeks later, due to a stormy flood, on 5 May 1719 at the Donskoy Monastery, alongside her husband. Archil's estates would pass, in 1724, to the family of his relative and yet another Georgian exile, Vakhtang VI of Kartli.  Children  Ketevan had children only by her marriage to Archil. These were one daughter and three sons: * Princess Darejan, known in Russia as Darya Archilovna (c. 1670 – 1740); she died unmarried and was buried at the Donskoy Monastery. * Prince Aleksandre, known in Russia as Aleksandr Archilovich (1674 – 20 February 1711), a Russian army artillery commander under Peter the Great. He was married, with one daughter. * Prince Mamuka, known in Russia as Matfey Archilovich (1676 – 23 March 1693); he died unmarried and was buried at the Donskoy Monastery. * Prince Davit, known in Russia as David Archilovich (2 July 1682 – 24 October 1688); he died unmarried, buried at the Novodevichy Convent, and reburied in 1711 at the Donskoy Monastery.

It has also been found on the fox (Vulpes vulpes), the dog (Canis familiaris), the cat (Felis catus), the European polecat (Mustela putorius), the mole (Talpa europaea) and the fallow deer (Dama dama). Description The badger flea, like other fleas, is a small, dark brown wingless insect with a tough, chitinous cuticle. Its body is flattened laterally and it has mouthparts designed for sucking the blood of a badger. Biology Like other fleas, the badger flea has a life cycle consisting of an egg, a larval, a pupal and an adult stage. A mature female flea has to have had a meal of blood before she starts to reproduce. After mating, the eggs are laid and often fall to the floor of the sett. The larvae that hatch out feed on organic debris and when fully developed, they weave cocoons and pupate. They remain in this state for several weeks, often being stimulated to emerge by warmth, vibrations or a raised level of carbon dioxide which indicates that a potential host is nearby. The newly hatched flea's primary aim is to find a host, have a meal of blood and reproduce. The badger flea is the vector of Trypanosoma pestanai, the causal agent of a protozoan disease of badgers that has been found in badgers living in Portugal, France, England, and Ireland. Behaviour Badgers spend much time grooming in an effort to dislodge parasites. Individuals concentrate on their undersides while social grooming occurs with one individual grooming another on its dorsal surface. Fleas try to avoid the scratching, retreating rapidly downwards and backwards with the lie of the fur. This is in contrast to fleas away from their host which run upwards and jump when disturbed. The grooming seems to disadvantage the fleas rather than merely having a social function. Researchers have found that when separated from their host, badger fleas jump repeatedly in an effort to reconnect. Many voided their gut contents which enabled them to leap significantly further. If they failed to find a suitable host they moved towards the light (the sett entrance) before becoming quiescent. This put them in a position to intercept a badger if one entered the sett. They were stimulated into further bouts of leaping by an increase in the level of carbon dioxide and jumped towards the source of the gas. In a research study they were found to respond to exhaled air by running and jumping in its direction. The most vigorous response was found to be made to a combination of a carbon dioxide source, a piece of dark-coloured card and movement in their vicinity. It was found that 50% of fleas were still alive after 35 days of separation from the host and, as badgers have a habit of moving between different setts, they would not avoid reinfestation by fleas if they returned to an empty sett within a few weeks.

History Neda Hassani was born to Ahmed and Foroogh Hassani, as the eldest child of an Iranian family of three children. The family left Iran in the early 1980s, taking refuge in Greece before settling in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Hassani attended Carleton University, studying computer science.Jeevan Vasagar, Parents mourn 'brave girl' who set herself on fire in memory of uncle; The Guardian, 25 June 2003. Retrieved 2013-12-27. Hassani was a supporter of the People's Mujahedin of Iran, as of 1988, following the execution of her uncle, Mahmoud Hassani, in Iran. She was not a member of the organization, according to her parents. Mahmoud Hassani was the younger brother of her father, and had been imprisoned for seven years in Iran, prior to his execution. As a child, Hassani had visited her uncle in prison. Her uncle was among a group of an estimated 35,000 dissidents executed at that time. Hassani's support for the Mujahedin led her to move to Paris, to join the National Council of Resistance of Iran.Sarah Kennedy, 'I'll send Neda's message to the world,' mother vows. Ottawa Citizen, July 1, 2003, pp. D1, D4. On June 17, 2003, Hassani was on holiday in London, when police in France raided the headquarters of the People's Mojahedin of Iran, holding approximately 160 members for questioning, including Maryam Rajavi, a co- leader of the group, with her husband, Massoud Rajavi. The group was suspected of planning attacks against Iranian interests in Europe. Hassani later joined a student protest at the French embassy in London, protesting the arrest in France and possible deportation to Iran of Rajavi and other members of the Mujahedin. There was a discussion among some of the protesters of protesting via self-immolation. Hassani was quoted as saying \\"We all think of doing that\\", despite the fact that co-leader Maryam Rajavi expressed her opposition to suicidal protests. On the evening of June 18, at approximately 7:15 p.m., Hassani returned, alone, to the front of the French embassy in London, where she doused herself in gasoline and set herself on fire. She was found two hours later, and subsequently died in hospital on June 23, in the presence of her mother, having never regained consciousness.BBC News, Mother's tribute to fire victim; June 26, 2003.

History The German immigrants moved to central Jutland when King Frederick V of Denmark promised 20 years of tax freedom, soil, livestock, money, and freedom from military service, for anyone who would cultivate the Jutlandic heaths. The settlers were mostly from Hesse and the Palatinate in modern-day Germany as well as from Austria. Men, women, and children included, 965 individuals spread across 265 families first arrived between 1759-63. The majority settled on Alheden in the southernmost part of Fjends and the northernmost part of Lysgård in central Jutland. This comprises the site of the towns of Frederiks, Grønhøj, Havredal, and Karup. Much of this land was difficult to cultivate because of how much heather the soil contained, but after it was burned the area became better suited for the cultivation of potatoes. The situation was difficult for the families. Many of settlers were craftsmen with little knowledge of farming. Most of the settlers subsequently left, with many moving back to Germany, but 59 of the families stayed on Alheden for more than a year. Surnames The Potato German settlers introduced a number of new surnames to Denmark. Though still rare in the country as a whole, many people living near Alheden still carry these surnames. *Agricola, *Betzer, Bitsch, Bräuner, Bärthel, *Cramer, *Dickes, Dürr, *Frank, *Gantzhorn, *Harritz, Herbel-Schmidt, Hermann, Herold, *Jung, *Krath, Kriegbaum, *Lajer, Lauth, *Marcher, Marquard, Maul, Morratz, *Philbert, *Rost, *Schönheider (also spelled Schønheider), *Wacher, Wendel, Winkler, Woller, Wunderlich, Würtz See also *History of Denmark#Changes in the agricultural economy *North Schleswig Germans References =Bibliography= *Valdemar Andersen (1970) Den jyske hedekolonisation (Aarhus: Universitetsforlaget.

In the general election of 1885, Tanner was elected MP for the Mid Cork constituency, and was re-elected unopposed for the seat until his death. His involvement in the Parliament was controversial, as his behaviour was often obstructive. The Times remarked after his death that \\"it was difficult to regard him as a serious politician ... he came repeatedly under the censure of the Speaker\\".

He played with the Mexico national team as a youth, joining them on road trips from the age of 10. At age 14, Urías met Los Angeles Dodgers scout Mike Brito, who had first scouted Fernando Valenzuela. In June 2012, the Dodgers discovered 15-year-old Urías at a showcase in Oaxaca, on the same scouting trip in Mexico on which they signed Yasiel Puig. The Dodgers signed him on August 12, his 16th birthday. The Dodgers paid a signing fee of $450,000, most of which went to the Diablos Rojos del México of the Mexican League. Minor leagues Urías made his professional debut on May 25, 2013, for the Great Lakes Loons in the Midwest League as the youngest player in the league, striking out six batters over three shutout innings. He made a total of 18 starts and finished the season 2–0 with a 2.48 ERA, recording 67 strikeouts in 54.1 innings. He spent 2014 with the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes of the California League. In 25 appearances (20 of which were starts), he was 2–2 with a 2.36 ERA. He struck out 109 batters while walking only 37.

He received an invitation to attend the team's 2015 major league spring training camp. After pitching in two games, for a total of two innings and a 4.50 ERA, he was the first to be cut from the roster and was reassigned to the team's minor league camp on March 14, 2015. Urías was ranked by MLBpipeline.com as the top left-handed pitching prospect in all of baseball entering the 2015 season. MLB.com ranked him the 8th-best prospect in baseball, and Baseball America named him the #10 prospect in 2015. The Dodgers assigned him to the AA Tulsa Drillers of the Texas League to start the 2015 season. He was 3–4 with a 2.77 ERA in 13 starts for Tulsa. Urias was promoted to the AAA Oklahoma City Dodgers on August 31, 2015. He struggled in his first AAA action, allowing nine runs in 4 innings over two starts. He also allowed six runs, including a grand slam homer, in just one inning in his one start in the Pacific Coast League playoffs. He was again invited to attend Dodgers spring training. He was assigned to AAA to begin the season, where he was 4–1 with a 1.10 ERA in seven starts. He also had a 27 inning scoreless streak during the month of May for Oklahoma City.

He was optioned back to AAA after the game. Three days later, he was returned to the active roster after starter Alex Wood went on the disabled list. Urías made his second start on June 2 against the Chicago Cubs. In 5 innings pitched, he gave up 6 runs (5 earned), which included 3 home runs. He allowed 8 hits, and struck out 4. He picked up his first major league win, against the Milwaukee Brewers, on June 28, 2016, when he allowed two runs on two hits in six innings. He was the first teenage Dodger pitcher to throw 100 pitches in a game since Joe Moeller in 1962. He pitched in 18 games for the Dodgers, 15 of them starts, and was 5–2 with a 3.39 ERA, 84 strikeouts and 31 walks. He led the major leagues in pickoffs, with six. Urías pitched two innings of relief in game five of the 2016 National League Division Series, picking up the win. At 20 years, 62 days old he became the youngest Dodgers pitcher to ever pitch in the post-season. He was two weeks younger than Don Drysdale was in game four of the 1956 World Series. He was also the fourth youngest pitcher in MLB post-season history, behind Ken Brett (1967 World Series), Bert Blyleven (1970 ALCS), and Don Gullett (1970 NLCS and 1970 World Series). He became the youngest pitcher ever to start a post-season game when he started game four of the 2016 National League Championship Series. He allowed four runs in only 3 innings in the game. 2017 The Dodgers chose to keep Urías in extended spring training rather than having him on the opening day roster to start 2017, with the goal of limiting his innings so he would be able to pitch more later in the season. He rejoined the major league starting rotation on April 27. He made five starts for the Dodgers and was 0–2 with a 5.40 ERA. He was optioned back to the minors on May 21. In June while pitching for Triple-A Oklahoma City, Urías tore the anterior capsule in his left shoulder, which ended his 2017 season and required surgery. 2018 Urías spent most of the 2018 season recuperating from his injury and didn't begin rehabbing in the minors until July 30. He made three appearances for the Dodgers during the regular season, pitching four scoreless innings in September. Despite that, he was added to the Dodgers roster for the 2018 NLCS and 2018 World Series. He allowed one run in 3 innings against the Milwaukee Brewers in the NLCS and one run in three innings against the Boston Red Sox in the World Series. 2019 Urías was scheduled to begin 2019 in the bullpen to reduce his innings in the early going, but injuries to Clayton Kershaw and Rich Hill led to him beginning the season in the rotation. He started four games at the start, including a nine strikeout game (in six innings) while allowing only one hit against the Brewers on April 18, after which he joined the bullpen. He picked up his first career save on May 6 against the Atlanta Braves. Urías was placed on paid administrative leave on May 14 as a result of a domestic battery investigation, but was reinstated on May 21. On August 17, Urias was suspended for 20 games. He wound up appearing in 37 games, with eight starts, and was 4–3 with a 2.49 ERA and 85 strikeouts. Balls hit against him had the lowest average exit velocity (83.2 mph) of those hit against all major league pitchers. 2020 Urías agreed with the Dodgers on a one-year, $1.0 million, contract for 2020, avoiding arbitration. In the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, he became a full-time starter for the Dodgers and he was 3–0 with a 3.27 ERA, in 11 games. Pitching style Urías's primary pitch is a fastball with a typical velocity between 90 and 95 miles per hour, peaking at 97. He also throws a low-80s changeup, curveball, and slider. His curveball initially had primarily horizontal movement, resembling a slurve. During the 2016 season, he altered his grip to add vertical movement. He began using the slider in 2015. Urías is also known for his pickoff move, leading the major leagues in his rookie season with six pickoffs. Personal life Urías underwent three surgeries on his left eye during his youth to remove a benign mass. As a result, his left eye is nearly closed, but he is able to see through it. When asked about his eye condition, Urías, a devout Roman Catholic, said, \\"That's how God works. He gave me a bad left eye but a good left arm.\\" On May 19, 2015, Urías had elective surgery to correct the condition. In May 2019, Urías was arrested for domestic battery. However, the case was dismissed and no further action would be taken unless another incident occurred.

It was commissioned by the sultan Murad III and designed by the imperial architect Mimar Sinan. History The Muradiye Mosque in Manisa was built between 1583 and 1586 for the Ottoman sultan Murad III. It replaced an earlier small mosque on the site that had been began in 1571 when prince Murad had been governor of Manisa. The sultanic mosque was designed by Mimar Sinan but built by the architect Mahmud Halife until his death and then from January 1586 by the architect Sedefkar Mehmed Aga who would later design the Sultan Ahmed Mosque in Istanbul. As well as tiled revetments some of the stonework was decorated by a team of painters sent from the capital. In 1584 the sultan ordered 150 Murano oil lamps from Venice. These were probably intended for the mosque. The associated madrasa and guest-house were not completed until after 1590. Neither Sinan nor Murad III visited Manisa to inspect the mosque after its completion. Architecture The mosque is built of sandstone and has a central dome and three half-domes covering the prayer hall. The portico is covered by five smaller domes and there are two single- galleried minarets. The interior is decorated with Iznik tiles. The mosque is part of a larger complex (Külliye) consisting of a medrese (Islamic school) and imaret (public charity kitchen). Most of historic Manisa was destroyed during the Greek army retreat from the city in 1922, the mosque was one of the few buildings to survive. The imaret is now the Manisa Museum.

It is a compact weevil typical of the Cryptorhynchinae.Shukla, R.P., Tandon, P.L. & Singh, S.J. (1984). Baculovirus – A new pathogen of Mango nut weevil, Sternochetus mangiferae (Fabricius) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Current Science. Vol 53. No. 11. 593-594. It was first described in 1775 in the genus Curculio. The adults are 7.5-9.5 mm long and 4 mm in width. Adult coming out of Mango The colour varies and they may be covered with black, greyish, reddish or yellowish scales. In Australia adult weevils are dark brown to black with grey markings. When disturbed, adults press their legs to the body, and fit their beak into a ventral groove. Females have an elevated ridge at the pygidial apex while it is rounded in the male. The adults are not strong fliers and are not found far from fallen fruit. New areas are infested by human transport of infested fruit. Eggs are elongated and creamy white and covered by a protective brown coating with two tiny tails at one end. It is widespread and occurs in most countries especially where mangoes are grown. The adult female lays eggs on the surface of the mango fruit. Larvae and pupae develop inside the fruit and adults emerge, cutting their way out of the seed and pericarp after the fruit falls and decays.Grové, T, Joubert, P H & de Beer., M S. (2007).

Originally created in 1998, to mark the centenary of the Nottinghamshire County Council, it was waymarked between the two southern starting points at Thrumpton and Attenborough, through to West Stockwith near Gainsborough at the northern limit of the county, a distance of some 84 miles. This Nottinghamshire route used both riverside paths and footpaths in the wider valley to link Nottingham, with Newark-on-Trent, Gainsborough and various villages via points of interest. It appeared on Ordnance Survey maps, and a book showing the route was also produced. The waymark consisted of a white disc with a blue arrow containing three wavy white lines. Extending the Route Various organisations were interested in extending the route of the Trent Valley Way so that it covered the entire length of the river from its source near Biddulph Moor in Staffordshire to Alkborough in Lincolnshire, where the Trent joins the Ouse to form the Humber estuary, a distance of 170 miles. The feasibility of a complete route along the Trent Valley was investigated in 2008, and it was assessed to have \\"considerable potential\\", and would attract 250,000 annual walkers. These would enjoy the combined attraction of \\"the river’s rich natural heritage and its history as an inland navigation\\". A draft map using existing footpaths was drawn up in 2009 for the entire 170 mile route, with preferred and interim alternatives where there were major access issues. One of the first revisions of the route was to remove the segment between Thrumpton to Nottingham, so that there was only a single starting point, which reduced the length to 77 miles. The start was then changed to Trentlock in Derbyshire, which extended the route slightly, so that it became 80 miles long. =Littleborough to Alkborough= Subsequently, plans were made to extend the path northwards along the tidal reaches to the Humber. In 2012 an extension of the waymarked route was confirmed, using paths mainly in North Lincolnshire to link the existing path with sections through to Alkborough, and a series of nine walking guides were produced to define this new 36 mile 58 km section. The first two sections act as a parallel route for part of the original valley way, but use riverside footpaths instead. * Littleborough to Gainsborough * Gainsborough to West Stockwith * West Stockwith to Haxey * Haxey to Epworth * Epworth to Belton * Belton to Keadby * Keadby to Scunthorpe * Scunthorpe to Burton Upon Stather * Burton Upon Stather to Alkborough The end of the route is the maze at Julian's Bower, which has a viewpoint that overlooks Trent Falls. Julian's Bower at Alkborough =Biddulph to Stone = There are also plans to establish a definitive route in the upper reaches of the Trent, from Biddulph to Stone. A similar set of walking guides to those produced for the Littleborough to Alkborough section will be created, along with a waymarked route.

Under the Emperor Caligula, the Bodyguard may have consisted of 500 to 1,000 men. The Germanic Cohort was valued as loyal and reliable.Suetonius, Galba 12: multisque experimentis fidelissimam. Emperors like Nero trusted the Germani especially because they were not of Roman origin.Tacitus, Annals 15, 58: Germanis, quibus fidebat princeps quasi externis. The guard was disbanded briefly after the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest,Suetonius, Augustus, 49.1 and was finally dissolved by Galba in 68 because of its loyalty to Nero (ruled 54-68), whom he had overthrown. The decision caused deep offense to the Batavi, and contributed to the outbreak of the Revolt of the Batavi in the following year.Tacitus Hist. II.5 Their indirect successors were the Equites singulares Augusti which were, likewise, mainly recruited from the Germani. They were apparently so similar to the Julio-Claudians' earlier German Bodyguard that they were given the same nickname, the \\"Batavi\\".Fuhrmann, Christopher J. (2012).

The Guaranteed Irish symbol is awarded to companies which create \\"quality\\" jobs, contribute to local communities and are \\"committed to Irish provenance\\". The members of Guaranteed Irish span all sectors including pharmaceutical; healthcare; technology; construction; energy; professional services; tourism; food and drink; art and design; retail; and more. When assessing an applicant for membership, the Appraisals Board of Guaranteed Irish looks at three core criteria; jobs, community and provenance. According to research published in February 2018, member companies of Guaranteed Irish directly employed 49,873 people in Ireland and generated a turnover of €11bn in Ireland in 2017. Globally, these companies generated a turnover of €25.84bn in 2017, with 46% of members exporting, primarily to the UK, US and mainland Europe. Over four decades, the Guaranteed Irish symbol has become one of the most recognised symbols in the country. Member companies can use the Guaranteed Irish symbol, a stylised overlay of the letters \\"g\\" and \\"i\\", on packaging and marketing materials for products and services certified by the organisation as having Irish origin or where at least 50% added value takes place in Ireland. Through the use of the Guaranteed Irish symbol, in addition to PR and marketing campaigns, networking events, business seminars, and lobbying activities, Guaranteed Irish assists its members to expand at home and abroad, contributing to Ireland's reputation for quality goods and services, and showcasing Ireland as best-in-class for business. The original Guaranteed Irish campaign was developed from December 1974 by the Irish Goods Council, originally the Working Group on the Promotion and Sale of Irish Goods within the National Development Association, which was incorporated separately in 1978. The Council's first director, Vivian Murray, was instrumental in the campaign. Spending on the campaign increased from £90,376 in 1976 to £361,491 in 1981. In 1980, 1,000 companies were participating. In 1982, the European Court of Justice ruled that, since the Irish Goods Council received state funding, its Guaranteed Irish campaign contravened the Treaty of Rome's rules against protectionism. As a consequence the campaign was separated from the Irish Goods Council into an independent nonprofit organisation, Guaranteed Irish Limited, which does not receive state funding. It was launched in 1984 by Patrick Hillery, then President of Ireland. In 2017, led by a new CEO, Brid O’Connell, and a new board of directors and team, the organisation rebranded and repositioned by opening up membership to international companies operating in Ireland. Guaranteed Irish was relaunched by the Taoiseach, Enda Kenny, in March 2017, using the original logo from the campaign's inception. In February, the inaugural Guaranteed Irish Month, to take place each March, was unveiled at the Irish Stock Exchange by Ciaran Cannon, T.D., Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade with special responsibility for the Diaspora and International Development, and Deirdre Somers, CEO of the Irish Stock Exchange. As a non-profit organisation, Guaranteed Irish is entirely funded through membership fees which is used to actively promote Guaranteed Irish businesses through online and offline PR and marketing activities. The organisation currently has 300 members with plans to increase the number of member companies to 500 by the end of 2018. In April 2018, Guaranteed Irish launched a new website.

It is a sheet cake made of yeast dough topped with apple, quark (curd) and poppy seeds and parts of it are covered with a glaze made of cream, whole egg, sugar and flour for thickening.[1] The term originates from a piece of men's clothing in the 14th century which was called Schecke and was made up of a medium-length tunic with a very tight waistline and was worn with a Dusing, a hip belt. The cake was named after this \\"tripartite garment\\" (upper part, belt, lower part). Preparation As the name is derived from a tripartite piece of clothing, Eierschecke consists of three parts or layers: the upper layer is made of creamy stirred egg yolk with butter, sugar, vanilla pudding and, lastly, beaten egg whites, which are folded into the batter. The middle layer (the \\"belt\\") consists of a kind of custard which, in addition to butter, egg, sugar and milk, also contains quark and vanilla flavouring. The cake base is either a yeast dough or a sponge cake. After these three layers are assembled, the cake is baked, then cut into rectangular pieces and served with coffee. While the recipe above is for the traditional Eierschecke from Dresden, there are also some variations and refinements of this recipe, e.g. the addition of raisins, almonds or Streusel, or even the coating of the whole cake with chocolate. File:Dresdner Eierschecke 6.jpgDresdner Eierschecke File:Dresdner Eierschecke 8.jpgDresdner Eierschecke with raisins File:Dresdner Eierschecke 7.jpgDresdner Eierschecke with chocolate covering File:Eierschecke mit Streuseln.JPGDresdner Eierschecke with Streusel Freiberger Eierschecke Another variation is the Freiberger Eierschecke, which is much flatter than the Dresdner Eierschecke and contains neither quark nor raisins. Its legend states that the quark (a type of soft cheese originally meant for baking) had been used to build the city wall of Freiberg in the 13th century. To compensate for the alleged loss of flavour, more egg, sugar and even raisins were used. The legend is deliberately nonsensical: dairy products like quark have no history of being used in mortar (unlike sticky rice mortar). The German author Erich Kästner once said: \\"Die Eierschecke ist eine Kuchensorte, die zum Schaden der Menschheit auf dem Rest des Globus unbekannt geblieben ist.\\" (The Eierschecke is a type of cake which, to the detriment of humanity, has remained unknown to the rest of the world), and Martin Walser says in his book Die Verteidigung der Kindheit (The defence of childhood): \\"Eierschecke gibt es außerhalb Sachsens nur ersatzweise und innerhalb Sachsens nirgends so gut wie im Toscana.\\" (There are only substitutes of Eierschecke outside of Saxony; within Saxony, there is no better Eierschecke than at the Toscana (referring to the Café Toscana in Dresden)) See also * List of cakes References *IREKS-Arkady-Institut für Bäckereiwissenschaft (Hrsg.): IREKS-ABC der Bäckerei. 4.

Biography Mihail Ciachir was born on April 27, 1861 in the Bessarabian village of Ceadîr-Lunga, in a Gagauz deacon's family. Ciachir studied at the Theological Seminary of Chișinău. After graduation, he taught at a men's theological school. Three years later, he was elected Chairman of the Chișinău School Board. In 1896, he appealed to the Ministry of Education of the Russian Empire for permission to print books in the Moldovan language. This was granted provided the Moldovan text appeared parallel to the Russian. From 1901, Ciachir published several books on Moldovan grammar, tutorials on Russian language and grammar. His textbook to help Moldovans learn Russian went through three editions in fourteen years. In 1904, Ciachir appealed to the Synod of the Orthodox Church to permit him to publish religious literature in the Gagauz language. Three years later, he released in Gagauz translation selected passages from the Old Testament, as well as the Gospel of St. Matthew. He was called the Apostle of the printed language by Gagauz contemporaries. After 1918, when Bessarabia became part of the Kingdom of Romania, Ciachir initiated the transition of Gagauz writing from the previous Cyrillic to the Latin script. In 1924, he joined the leadership of the Alexander Nevsky brotherhood of the Orthodox Church to coordinate the struggle against the Romanianisation of Bessarabia. Ciachir worked for the Romanian magazine Viata Basarabiei between 1933-34. In 1934, he published in the Gagauz language The History of the Gagauz of Bessarabia, and two years later, Wedding Ceremonies of the Gagauz. These two books established his ethnographic credentials. In 1938, Ciachir published his Gagauz-Romanian dictionary. Ciachir died in 1938 following a short illness, and was buried in the Central Cemetery on Armenian street in Chișinău. Acclaim Although Mihail Ciachir was not a professionally trained researcher, the value of his contributions to history and Gagauz tradition cannot be overestimated. Modern Gagauz researchers depend on his works, and while reinterpreting them, continue to treasure them as a valuable source for investigations carried out in a comparative historical perspective. Besides the literary and historical impact of Ciachir, his role in defining the Gagauz nationhood is lauded, in particular his spiritual and moral leadership of the Gagauz people. Indeed, for his attempts at a liturgical Gagauz, he is referred to as the Cyril and Methodius of his people, and celebrated throughout the province of Gagauzia today. The Governor of Gagauzia Mihail Formuzal declared 2011 the Year of Ciachir.

The Sledgehammer plot involved plans to bomb two mosques in Istanbul, attack a military museum and blame it on religious extremists, and attack a Turkish plane and blame it on Greece. Three hundred and thirty-one of the 365 suspects were sentenced to prison on Sept. 21, 2012, while the remaining 34 were acquitted. Three retired generals were sentenced to life in prison on charges of “attempting to overthrow the government by force,” but their terms were later reduced to 20 years. Turkey’s Constitutional Court ruled in June 2014 that the rights of most of the convicted suspects had been violated, and ordered the immediate release of 236 of them. The rest were released later. A new trial began on Nov. 3, 2014. Reports released in December 2014 and February 2015 claimed that some of the evidence in the case was fabricated. In 2010 it was revealed that the phones of both Baransu and his wife, Esra Baransu, had been tapped by the Turkish Gendarmerie on false pretences. The Gendarmerie had obtained warrants for the phone taps by falsely representing the IMEI code numbers of the Baransus' phones as belonging to fictional Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) suspects.Today's Zaman, 4 August 2010, Gendarmerie wiretaps journalist Baransu's wife's phoneToday's Zaman, 25 April 2011, Baransu invites defenders of press to today’s hearing In 2011 five military officers were each sentenced to five years in jail for these actions.Today's Zaman, 24 May 2011, Five officers sentenced to over five years in prison each for illegally wiretapping journalist Baransu In 2011 a voice recording posted online, allegedly by a military official, said that Baransu should be killed as a warning to others.Today's Zaman, 2 June 2011, Major says journalist Baransu should be executed in voice recording His books include Mösyö: Hanefi Avcı’nın Yazamadıkları (2010), which alleges that former police chief Hanefi Avcı had committed torture and developed connections with the Devrimci Karargâh group, and that Avcı had published his book on Ergenekon to try to ward off arrest.Today's Zaman, 5 December 2010, Avcı's shady connections, tortures documented in book His 2012 book Pirus alleged plans to assassinate Chief of the General Staff Hilmi Özkök in order to permit a 2004 coup, and suggested that the plans were foiled when US officials found out about them.Today's Zaman, 22 March 2012, Book: Pro-coup generals plotted to assassinate Özkök Early life and education Baransu studied in the United States for over three years, working on a thesis on child murders.odatv, 18 June 2009, MEHMET BARANSU ABD'DE 4 YIL NE YAPTI? Media career =\\"Sledgehammer\\" plot= In 2014, Turkey's highest court ruled that the officers convicted in connection with the “Sledgehammer” plot had not received a fair trial. On March 1, 2015, in the wake of allegations by the ruling party that the “Sledgehammer” documents were forgeries, Baransu was detained in his home in the Kağıthane district of Istanbul. Meanwhile police counter-terrorist teams searched his home for ten or twelve hours (reports differed), and seized some documents. During the months preceding this detention, he had been detained several times by police. =Arrest= The next day he was arrested and charged with obtaining the secret documents relating to the “Sledgehammer” plan. The Guardian described the allegations against Baransu as “extraordinary.” He faced up to eight years in prison. The exact charge leveled against Baransu was that he had formed a criminal organization\\" and procured, publicized and then destroyed “documents related to the state’s interests at home and abroad.” =Reactions= In an article in the daily newspaper Cumhuriyet, Ahmet Altan, founding editor of Taraf, defended Baransu, writing, “Since when have coup plans been classified as ‘documents related to state security’ and ‘state knowledge that needs to be kept classified?’ I am the person who published the [Sledgehammer] story, the one who decided it needed to be published, the one who didn’t doubt for a moment that Sledgehammer was a coup plot.” Nina Ognianova of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists called for Baransu's release, saying: “A journalist’s job is to report on developments in the public interest, and it is absurd that a journalist should be prosecuted for obtaining documents which, in any case, were shared with authorities.” In an article headlined “What lies behind Mehmet Baransu’s arrest?”, Baransu's colleague Yasemin Çongar noted claims “that Baransu drafted fake documents and committed military espionage.” Çongar asked: “Would a journalist really submit the documents he holds to the state if he made them or thinks they are fake? Would a journalist really submit the documents and evidence to the state and publish these items, if his purpose is to sell these documents and military secrets to other states?” Çongar added that Baransu apparently “was not arrested because of these rumors” but because he was “being accused of acquiring information that should have been kept confidential in the interests of the state and national security under Article 327 of the Turkish Penal Code (TCK). Should we now assume that coup preparations are legal and that they should be kept confidential for national security? Should we argue that journalists should simply ignore the right of the people to be properly informed and stay away from documents and evidence showing illegal activities conducted within the state? Does this not mean giving up on journalism? Does this not mean giving up on Article 3 of the Press Law and Article 28 of the Constitution?” Çongar further stated that “When I read the documents and listened to the CDs that served as the basis of those reports, I concluded that there was actually a coup plan devised in the army in 2003. I still hold this view.” The group Article 19 condemned Baransu's arrest and called for his immediate release. Article 19 had previously expressed concern about the arrest of journalists working for the newspaper Zaman, which, like Taraf, it noted, “play an important role in investigating alleged government corruption and maintaining a diversity of voices in the Turkish press.” The International Press Institute (IPI) also condemned Baransu's detention. “This case appears to be an effort to target Mr. Baransu for the materials he published, in violation of the right to press freedom,” IPI Director of Advocacy and Communications Steven M. Ellis said. “Given the circumstances of the case against him, there appears to be no legitimate reason to detain Mr. Baransu while the investigation proceeds and we call on Turkish authorities to release him immediately.” Meanwhile Baransu faced a possible 52-year prison sentence “for his 2013 revelations of an 'action plan' developed by Turkey's National Security Council targeting the Fethullah Gulen religious movement.” = Jail sentences = On Sunday, July 19th, Baransu was sentenced by the court board to 19 years and 6 months in prison for three crimnes. For \\"violating privacy\\" he was sentenced to two years in prison; for \\"disclosing classified information\\" he was sentenced to four years in prison; and for \\"membership of an armed terrorist organisation\\" he was sentenced to 13 years and six months in prison. Baransu has been held behind bars since 2015, having also been convicted that year of \\"insulting the President\\" and sentenced to 10 months in prison on 30 June, 2015 Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. Then, on 2 February, 2016, he received an additional sentence of 11 months and 20 days for his criticism of Hakan Fidan, head of the National Intelligence Organization. While imprisoned, he waas tried for allegedly leaking secret documents of the state in an article titled \\"The Decision to Finish Gülen Was Made in 2004\\". This was the article where he exposed the planned coup against the Turkish Government. The prosecutor for the case demanded 50 years and 6 months in prison for Baransu.

Production Seeking a compatible series to insert in its Sunday evening lineup after its hit America's Funniest Home Videos show, ABC aired Tim Conway's Funny America in the summer of 1990. Starring Tim Conway, Tim Conway's Funny America borrowed heavily from the format of the long-running Candid Camera show, with Conway traveling around the United States in various disguises and playing practical jokes on unsuspecting people while hidden cameras filmed their reactions. Among the shows gags were Conway pretending to be an old man crossing a street, an eccentric employee of a pet-grooming salon, a member of the \\"fashion police\\" in a motorcycle policemans uniform ticketing passersby on the street for their attire, a clumsy teppanyaki chef in a Japanese restaurant, and an aerobics class leader - the latter in the guise of his character \\"Dorf,\\" a dark-haired man with a normal-sized head, body, and arms, but extremely short legs and an odd foreign accent. Conway presented the resulting videos to a studio audience. Despite his success as a member of the cast of the situation comedy McHale's Navy from 1962 to 1966 and in two 1964 theatrical films spun off from the series, McHale's Navy and McHale's Navy Joins the Air Force, as well as his popularity during several years as a regular on The Carol Burnett Show in the 1970s, Tim Conway had found no success in starring in a television show of his own. His situation comedies Rango in 1967, The Tim Conway Show in 1970, and Ace Crawford, Private Eye in 1983 had all been cancelled after short runs, as had two comedy-variety series, The Tim Conway Comedy Hour in the fall of 1970 and The Tim Conway Show in 1980-1981. Conway had no better luck with Tim Conways Funny America, which was cancelled after only a few weeks on the air. A total of seven episodes aired, including a special on April 29, 1990, and six weekly episodes broadcast between July 29 and September 2, 1990. Tim Conways Funny America aired at 8:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Sunday throughout its brief run.

Kuykendall was twice elected as a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates representing Hampshire County (1907–1908 and 1919–1920). Kuykendall also served three terms as the mayor of Romney and later fulfilled the position of city attorney. Kuykendall was born in 1878 in Hampshire County, West Virginia, into one of the oldest families in the county, which was of Dutch descent. He was raised on his family's farm, where he engaged in agricultural pursuits. Kuykendall was educated in Hampshire County's rural public schools and subsequently completed his post-secondary education at Hampden–Sydney College and Washington and Lee University. In 1901, he graduated from the Cumberland School of Law, then completed a course in jurisprudence at the University of North Carolina School of Law. Kuykendall first practiced law in Greensboro, North Carolina, before establishing a law practice in Romney, West Virginia. He was elected to represent Hampshire County in the West Virginia House of Delegates for one term in 1906 and another term in 1918, each consisting of two years. He was the mayor of Romney for three terms, and in 1922 he served as Romney's city attorney. Kuykendall was elected to three terms as a member of the Hampshire County Board of Education; he also served as a Chancery Commissioner for the county. During World War I, Kuykendall was a member of the Legal Advisory Board of Hampshire County; he also participated in Liberty bond drives and directed sales to raise American Red Cross funds. Kuykendall was engaged in the management of a commercial peach orchard near Romney known as Sherman Orchard. He died in 1928 and was interred at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney.  Early life and family  James Sloan Kuykendall was born on December 9, 1878, in the Springfield Magisterial District of Hampshire County, West Virginia. He was the eldest child and son of William Kuykendall and his wife Hannah Pierce Sloan Kuykendall. Kuykendall's family was of Dutch descent and was one of the oldest families residing in Hampshire County. He was probably named for his maternal grandfather, James Sloan. Kuykendall had two younger brothers and one younger sister: Michael Blue Kuykendall, Richard Sloan Kuykendall, and Nellie Frank Kuykendall. For the first 20 years of his life, Kuykendall resided on his family's farm, where he engaged in agricultural pursuits.  Education  Kuykendall received his primary education in Hampshire County's rural public schools. He commenced his higher education studies at Hampden–Sydney College in Hampden Sydney, Virginia, and later attended Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. Kuykendall subsequently engaged in the study of jurisprudence at the Cumberland School of Law of Cumberland University in Lebanon, Tennessee, from which he received a diploma in 1901. He then completed a similar course in law at the University of North Carolina School of Law in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Following this course at the University of North Carolina, Kuykendall passed his bar examination before the North Carolina Supreme Court and was admitted to the bar in North Carolina in September 1903.  Law career  Following his admission to the North Carolina bar, Kuykendall commenced practicing law in Greensboro, where he practiced for a little over a year before returning to West Virginia. He established his law practice in Romney and made his permanent residence there. Kuykendall argued his first case before the Hampshire County Circuit Court in defense of a Mr. Miller, who had been charged with petit larceny. Kuykendall secured the acquittal of his client, which further encouraged the young lawyer. Following this case, he continued to perform as a criminal defense lawyer. According to historian James Morton Callahan, Kuykendall \\"adhered to his rule to take part only on the side of the defense, and he has a merited reputation or skill and ability in that particular field.\\" By 1923, he had been a defense attorney in three murder cases: State v. Hetrick, State v. Averell, and State v. Gardner. Kuykendall secured acquittals for his clients in State v. Hetrick and State v. Averell, but in State v. Gardner, his client was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment. As an attorney for the Hampshire Southern Railroad Company in 1907, Kuykendall worked to acquire the right-of-way for the rail line through the South Branch Potomac River valley between the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) South Branch line at Romney and Petersburg.  Political career  = Romney municipal offices = Kuykendall was elected to his first term as mayor of Romney in January 1906 by a margin of eight votes. He and the elected city council members ran on an anti-liquor license platform. At the time of the election, Romney had been following a policy of banning the issuance of liquor licenses within the city for over 20 years. Throughout his political career, Kuykendall served a total of three terms as Romney's mayor. He later served as Romney's city attorney in 1922. = West Virginia House of Delegates = In late 1906, Kuykendall was elected to his first term as a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates and represented Hampshire County from 1907 through 1908 in the 28th West Virginia Legislative Session.

He was elected to a second term in the House of Delegates in 1918 and served in the 34th West Virginia Legislative Session from 1919 through 1920. In January 1920, Kuykendall participated in a conference between Maryland and West Virginia legislators, which recommended that the states' highway commissions be authorized to connect their state highway systems at one or more points crossing the Potomac River. = Hampshire County offices = Kuykendall took an interest in the Hampshire County Schools system and was elected to three terms as a member of the Hampshire County Board of Education. He also served in a county-wide position alongside Robert White and Joshua Soule Zimmerman as a Commissioner in Chancery for the Hampshire County Circuit Court. During World War I, Kuykendall was a member of the Legal Advisory Board of Hampshire County, during which time he assisted in producing several hundred questionnaires for the county's prospective soldiers. He also participated in Liberty bond drives and directed sales to raise funds for the American Red Cross. = West Virginia Democratic Party offices = Kuykendall was a lifelong member of the Democratic Party and cast his first vote for Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan in the United States presidential election of 1900. He was elected as a member of the Hampshire County Democratic Party Central Committee in 1908, and he was elected to three terms as the committee's chairperson. Kuykendall was also elected as the chairperson of the Executive Committee of West Virginia's 2nd congressional district in 1914 and served for one term. He was nominated as a presidential elector for the 2nd congressional district in the Electoral College for the election (1912) and reelection (1918) of Woodrow Wilson. In 1916, Kuykendall was a delegate to the West Virginia Democratic Party State Convention at Parkersburg that nominated John J. Cornwell as the party's gubernatorial candidate. He was also both a delegate and chairperson of the West Virginia Democratic Party's Congressional Convention that nominated William Gay Brown, Jr., as a candidate for the United States House of Representatives. Kuykendall was a strong proponent of Brown, whom he supported in subsequent conventions and elections.  Business pursuits  According to The Census of the Peach Crop of 1907 in West Virginia published by the West Virginia Department of Agriculture, Kuykendall was engaged in the management of a commercial peach orchard near Romney known as Sherman Orchard. In 1907, Kuykendall's orchard produced Carman, Champion, Elberta, Salways, Bilyeu, and Heath Cling peach varieties, totaling 5,800 baskets in all. Kuykendall was still operating a peach orchard in 1920.  Later life and death  Kuykendall suffered a stroke in late 1927. On 10 February 1928, he suffered a stroke and paralysis in a courtroom of the Winchester courthouse after the delivery of his closing argument in a circuit court criminal case. Kuykendall died at Winchester Memorial Hospital on the morning of 12 February. On 14 February, Kuykendall's funeral service was held at his Romney residence and it was officiated by the Reverend H. B. Wheeler, presiding elder of the Moorefield District of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. He was interred at Indian Mound Cemetery. Kuykendall was survived by his wife Bertha, his three children, and his brother, Richard Sloan Kuykendall.

Personal life  Kuykendall was married in Hampshire County on April 5, 1905, to Bertha Ray Williams (November 10, 1883 – March 4, 1962), born in Fairfax County, Virginia, and the daughter of Reverend James P. Williams and his wife Mary S. Williams. Williams's father was the presiding elder of the Moorefield District of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. Kuykendall and his wife Bertha had three children together including two daughters and one son: * Alma Elizabeth Kuykendall Sheehan (January 14, 1906 – December 6, 1970), married on June 31, 1928, to William Terrell Sheehan (December 5, 1902 – June 16, 1957) * James Sloan Kuykendall, Jr. (December 11, 1906 – February 17, 1995), married Emily Light (June 29, 1911 – June 19, 1982) * Mary Ray Kuykendall Armstrong (January 5, 1909 – May 15, 1996), married Robert W.

The band consists of Julian Neville (guitar/vocals), Joe Chilstone-Vause (bass) and Rich Watts (drums/backing vocals). They have released one studio album: Our Days (2014) and one live album Live in York (2015) as well as two singles. The band cites Booker T. & the MG's, The Mar-Keys and the Rolling Stones as influences. The band has been labelled a “Future Classic” and described as “infectious blues-rock” by national radio station, Real Radio XS and proclaimed by Hattie Pearson of XFM to be “one of Manchester’s finest exports in recent times.” All the music and lyrics for Turrentine Jones' songs are written by the band's frontman Julian Neville. History =Early years (2011-12)= After several line-up changes, demo releases and low-key gigs in London and Manchester, Turrentine Jones officially settled on a line-up in 2012 which consisted of Julian Neville, Thomas Scotson and Rich Watts.

During an interview in February 2013 Neville described Turrentine Jones as a study in contrasts: > \\"I consider myself gruff and guardedly wry, while Rich Watts (drummer) is > more voluble and outwardly enthusiastic. Thomas Scotson (Hammond organ) is > from Finland... we're all from different countries actually.\\" – Julian > Neville The album received instant praise with their debut single, \\"Moonlight is On Yer Side\\" debuting on BBC Introducing and was hailed a \\"magnificent debut..\\" by Natalie-Eve Williams.

When the band came up with \\"Turrentine Jones\\", Neville wrote it down. According to a BBC interview: \\"Neville and the band have been cagey about what the name of the act means, and each live interview is an opportunity to dress it up however they feel at the time.\\"  Endorsement  Turrentine Jones are endorsed by Rotosound, Peavey and Cornell boutique valve amplifiers.

He is the lead vocalist, guitarist, and principal songwriter of Turrentine Jones. Neville was born in Waratah, a suburb of Newcastle in Australia and raised in Gloucester, a small rural town in New South Wales. He attended Gloucester High School (1997–2003) and was later described by his Music teacher, Andrew Scully, as \\"someone quick to learn, with a natural ear to pick up a guitar and play what he heard. Neville was never particularly vocal, but you could sense when pieces of music moved him.\\" Neville spent most of his early childhood years listening to soul and early rock and roll citing Booker T & The MG's and The Animals as early influences. Neville turned his attentions to guitar music following the breakthrough of grunge in the 90's. Neville's mother gave him a classical guitar for his birthday when he was 6–7 years old and he began learning. In 2008, Neville left Australia for England having revealed becoming jaded with the local music scene at a young age where he had performed alongside several notable artists including David Knopfler of Dire Straits and Colin Hay of Men at Work. In his own words: “I gave myself too many distractions and felt I wasn't getting anywhere — Just blasting and laughing my way through the time. It was great. I had fun. But I needed a release.” – Julian Neville. Neville moved from Australia to the United Kingdom in 2009, where he had performed as a solo acoustic singer-songwriter supporting the likes of David Knopfler of Dire Straits and Colin Hay of Men at Work. Neville's songwriting with Turrentine Jones has been described often as sultry and darkly-sensual, which he matches with wit, warmth and a spoonful or two of suggestion in his lyrics. This is particularly highlighted on the band's first two single releases Le Début and Show Me Mercy.

Plot Three 12-year-old kids, McGee, Gretchen and Squirt board the wrong summer camp bus and have all sorts of adventures in a camp called Camp Lakebottom, while trying to protect the camp from McGee's nemesis Jordan Buttsquat at Camp Sunny Smiles. Characters * McGee (voiced by Scott McCord): Described as being a 12-year-old daredevil and mastermind, McGee is a thrill seeker whose curiosity often leads him to act before he thinks. He has a habit of ignoring the counselors' warnings and as a result constantly gets himself and his friends into trouble, but it is his eager mind which always gets them back out as well. This has led him to developing the catchphrase \\"Should've thought that through.\\" Out of all of the campers he is the most intrigued and tolerant of Camp Lakebottom, being fascinated by all of its potential sources of fun and adventure. He is a self-proclaimed master of pranks, as revealed in \\"Pranks for Nothing\\", but his pranks are actually quite lame. His nemesis is Buttsquat. * Gretchen (voiced by Melissa Altro): She is a girl who is described as being anything but \\"sugary sweet\\"; she is sardonic and indifferent about everything. Her lack of enthusiasm is made up with her sharp, critical tongue. With a black belt in karate, and an intolerance toward wrongdoing, Gretchen is not a girl to mess with. Her nemesis is Suzi. However underneath the tough exterior she has a huge heart, and secretly wishes she could be like any normal girl (though she would never ever reveal this). Her catchphrase is \\"Ya think?!\\" usually said to McGee when a plan has gone away and he points out the obvious. She is revealed to have a severe phobia of chipmunks in \\"Cheeks of Dread\\". Her dad calls her \\"Gretchikins\\" and her mom calls her \\"Gretchywetchy\\". Gretchen is nicknamed \\"The Gretch\\" and her parents have the surname Gritcherson. * Squirt (voiced by Darren Frost): McGee's best friend. He is always cheerful, and a friend to all living things, even if they're trying to kill him. He has befriended just about every monster ever to set foot in Camp Lakebottom. While his omnibenevolence sometimes comes in handy in dealing with the monsters that constantly appear, his ignorance often makes him susceptible to control from several villains, the most prominent example being \\"Mindsuckers From the Depths\\" where an evil, giant leech attaches to his head and mind-controls him. In \\"Late Afternoon of the Living Gitch\\" it's revealed he has worn the same pair of underwear all his life. * Sawyer (voiced by Cliff Saunders): A lovable Zombie, with a multipurpose tool taking the place of his left hand, which is frequently a chainsaw. He is one of the camp's counselors, and the one who usually accompanies the kids on their adventures. As a zombie, his head and limbs constantly fall off, but can be reattached. He has distanced himself from the stereotype that zombies are mindless monsters who hunger for brains and has revealed that he has a heart (quite literally as he takes it out of his chest), he has vowed to look after the human campers, and often acts as a grandfatherly figure to them. He serves as the camp's handy man, and has constructed bizarre inventions over the course of the series, including a Frankenstein's Monster in \\"Frankenfixer\\". In \\"Zombie Dearest\\" Sawyer is revealed to have a zombie mother who acts like a stereotypical brain eating zombie, who Sawyer abandoned out of defiance to her habits. * Armand (voiced by Adrian Truss): A sasquatch with a passion for the performing arts, and dreams of becoming an actor. He is another one of the camp's counselors. While he is usually very kind, easygoing, and quite difficult to anger, the rare instances in which he has, have proven to be dangerous to everyone's safety. The episode \\"Marshmallow Madness\\" reveals that he has a severe addiction to marshmallows; he will be driven into an unstoppable, hunger-filled rage if he is ever close to the delicacies. * Rosebud (voiced by Jonathan Wilson): A short, bitter woman who resembles a serial killer with a German accent, who serves as the camp's cook and the final counselor. She takes pride in her cooking; however, her meals are not only inedible, but frequently threaten the lives of the campers. She is known to use whatever foul things she manages to find as ingredients in her meals. Squirt appears to be the only one who enjoys her cooking. She is the strictest counselor, and is least tolerant of McGee's antics, however underneath it all she means well. It was also revealed back in her younger days, Rosebud used to be an infamous monster hunter for S.M.A.C.K (Society of Monster Annihilation and Creature Kicking) but gave it up after her love for cooking when she met Sawyer and Armand when she was tasked for destroying all monsters in Lakebottom. * Jordan Buttsquat (voiced by Carter Hayden): Buttsquat is the spoiled-rich son of the owner of \\"Camp Sunny Smiles\\" (Lakebottom's rival camp) and McGee's nemesis. He serves as the main antagonist of the series, constantly going to Camp Lakebottom in attempt to wreck the rival camp, or to mock the Bottom Dwellers' poor living conditions by showing off some new, fancy, high-tech item available at his camp. However Buttsquat is severely lacking in the intellectual department and McGee is able to outsmart him every time, which will lead him to say the reoccurring catchphrase \\"I will have revenge.\\" McGee has saved Buttsquat's life on the many occasions his nemesis has been threatened by the various monsters, but he never displays gratitude afterwards. * Suzi (voiced by Bryn McAuley): McGee's older sister, who is a pageant queen, and became queen of \\"Sunny Smiles\\" on her first day. She is Gretchen's nemesis, who has held a grudge against her ever since she beat Gretchen in a beauty pageant contest. She has a crush on Buttsquat, and often accompanies him in his schemes to thwart Lakebottom. She always refers to McGee as \\"Baby Bruv\\", and while the two siblings sometimes bicker, they are usually shown to care for each other. Despite having less evil intent than Buttsquat, there are several occasions where she has posed as a far bigger threat and danger to everyone's safety, as she has a tendency to get entangled by one of the supernatural monsters or phenomena that have appeared. Examples of this include: \\"Stage Fright\\" where she uses stage bad luck and inadvertently summons an evil spirit which possesses her and nearly destroys Lake Bottom. Another example is \\"28 Suzis Later\\" where she is cloned by a mystical mud, causing the camp to be overrun by Suzi clones. * Slimey is a gigantic octopus like creature who lives in the lake, and the most frequent appearing reoccurring character in the series. While he terrified the campers on their first appearance by grabbing them and tossing them in the air, it's revealed he actually wants to play with them. He later becomes quite good friends with the campers, especially Squirt, and will often provide them with fun by tossing them into the air when they're swimming so that they can dive. He obeys any of the counselors, and will quite often aid the campers during their adventures involving the lake. Only his tentacles are shown, so it is unknown what his body looks like.

Located in the Negev desert around ten kilometres east of Beersheba and to the south of highway 25, it falls under the jurisdiction of Neve Midbar Regional Council. In it had a population of . Demography The township is populated by three large families; Abu Talul, Abu Sulab (Abu Silb) and el-Shihabi.Abu Talul , Abu Basma Regional Council official site There are also several thousand \\"diaspora\\" Bedouin living in the area outside the township. History Prior to the establishment of Israel, the Negev Bedouin were a semi-nomadic society going through a process of sedentariness since the Ottoman rule of the region. During the British Mandate period, the administration did not provide a legal frame to justify and preserve lands’ ownership. In order to settle this issue, Israel’s land policy was adapted to a large extent from the Ottoman land regulations of 1858 as the only preceding legal frame. It enabled Israel to nationalize most of the Negev lands using the state’s land regulations from 1969. Bedouin settlement Israel has continued the policy of sedentarization of Negev Bedouins imposed by the Ottoman authorities, and at first it included regulation and re-location - during the 1950s Israel has re-located two-thirds of the Negev Bedouins into an area that was under a martial law. The next step was to establish seven townships built especially for Bedouins in order to sedentarize and urbanize them by offering them better life conditions, proper infrastructure and high quality public services in sanitation, health and education, and municipal services. All the more so the rate of the Bedouin population in Israel is among the highest in the world - it doubles its size every 15 years. These townships are: Hura, Lakiya, Ar'arat an-Naqab (Ar'ara BaNegev), Shaqib al- Salam (Segev Shalom), Tel as-Sabi (Tel-Sheva), Kuseife and the city of Rahat, the largest among them).State of Israel. Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Foreign Affairs. List of Issues to be taken up in Connection with the Consideration of Israel's Fourth and Fifth Periodic Reports of Israel (CEDAW/C/ISR/4 and CEDAW/C/ISR/5) These townships cannot resolve the issue of high population density and illegal construction in the Negev absolutely, so besides expanding existing towns, the Israeli government has decided to construct 13 additional settlements for the Negev Bedouin, and Abu Talul is one of them.Bedouin information Israel Land Administration Not all Bedouins agree to move from tents and structures built on the state lands into apartments prepared for them. In permanent planned villages live about 60% of Bedouin citizens of Israel, while the rest - in illegal homes spread all over North Negev subject to demolition and lacking basic services and they refuse to move into the newly built townships with the full basic infrastructure. Creation Started as an unrecognized Bedouin village, Abu Talul became an officially approved settlement with the implementation of the government Abu Basma plan. This plan was to find an appropriate solution to the scattered Bedouin communities living without official permits all over the Northern Negev. On February 19, 2006 Abu Talul was recognized officially by the state and became a part of now defunct Abu Basma Regional Council. When the Abu Basma Regional Council was dismantled by the Israeli Ministry of Interior order on November 5, 2012, and two new regional councils were created instead, Abu Talul became a part of one of them - Neve Midbar Regional Council.Press Release, 14 November 2012 Abu Basma Regional Council website Infrastructure In 2012 the township infrastructure was ready only partly. There were two school buildings, kindergartens, a medical clinic, a perinatal (baby) care center \\"Tipat Halav\\", 3 mosques, cemetery and a sports ground. Seven more objects were to be built in the close future - schools, kindergartens, medical clinics for the convenience of the local public. Education opportunities In July 2013 there were three operating elementary schools and one middle school attended by 2400 pupils in Abu Talul. There was also one high school attended by 120 students, half of them girls and half of them boys from the village and its vicinity. The high school consists of 12 caravans.After a Seven-Year Struggle, First High School Opens in Abu Tulul Arab Bedouin Village in the Naqab, August 31, 2012 Due to the traditional nature of Arab Bedouin society there is a high drop-out rate, and it is significantly higher among high school-aged girls, than high school-aged boys.

Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc., 570 U.S. 1 (2013), is a 2012-term United States Supreme Court case revolving around Arizona's unique voter registration requirements, including the necessity of providing documentary proof of citizenship. In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court held that Arizona's registration requirements were unlawful because they were preempted by federal voting laws.. Background The Arizona voter registration requirements arose from a 2004 Arizona proposition, Arizona Proposition 200 (2004), which was a ballot initiative designed in part \\"to combat voter fraud by requiring voters to present proof of citizenship when they register to vote and to present identification when they vote on election day.\\" (per curiam). The state law requires, besides other things, persons to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote, and requires voter- registration officials to \\"reject\\" any application for registration, including a Federal Form under the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, that is not accompanied by documentary evidence of citizenship. A group of Arizona residents and a group of nonprofit organizations challenged the Arizona law in court. The District Court of Arizona granted Arizona summary judgment on the respondents' claim that the federal Act preempts Arizona's requirement. In October 2010, the Ninth Circuit Court reversed, holding that the state's requirement of documentary proof of citizenship is invalid as being preempted by the registration provision in the federal NVRA, at least when an applicant uses the National Mail Voter Registration Form (the \\"Federal Form\\") to register to vote in federal elections, and that the requirement to provide voter identification at the polling place is valid. However, in April 2011, the court granted Arizona's petition for en banc review of this ruling, and it heard oral arguments on June 21, 2011.Arizona Attorney General Press Release: \\"Horne Argues in Favor of Arizona's Law Requiring Proof of Citizenship to Vote\\" In April 2012, the en banc court also held that the requirement to provide proof of citizenship to register to vote is invalid as preempted by the NVRA and that the requirement to provide voter identification at the polling place is valid. The Supreme Court of the United States declined to stay the ruling on June 28, 2012.Arizona, et al. v. Abeytia, et al., No. 11-A-1189 (order), (U.S. Supreme Court, June 28, 2012) In July 2012, Arizona petitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's ruling.Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, et. al, Petition for Writ of Certiorari (U.S. Supreme Court, July 16, 2012) The Supreme Court granted the petition in October 2012,Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council, Grant of Petition for Writ of Certiorari (U.S. Supreme Court, October 15, 2012) and it heard oral arguments on March 18, 2013.Arizona, et. al., Petitioners, v. The Inter Tribal Council of Arizona, Inc., Transcript of Oral Argument (U.S. Supreme Court, March 18, 2013) Opinion of the Court On June 17, 2013, the Supreme Court ruled against Arizona in a 7-2 decision, which struck down the state law. Justice Scalia wrote the majority opinion, confirming the Ninth Circuit's rulings and holding that the state requirements relating to voter registrations were pre-empted by the federal NVRA law, which mandates states to \\"accept and use\\" the Federal Form. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented. However, the Court also suggested ways for Arizona to overcome the hurdle. The 7-2 Decision stated “Arizona is correct that the Elections Clause empowers Congress to regulate how federal elections are held, but not who may vote in them. The latter is the province of the states.” However, because Attorney General Tom Horne’s predecessor as Attorney General had not appealed an adverse decision by the commission, the case was sent back for a new petition to the commission to be appealed. It was consolidated with a 10th circuit case, which ruled adversely, and the Supreme Court chose not to review a second time. The Court also held that Arizona may petition to have more requirements added to the federal standard.

One of the officers and their driver died while resisting the attackers.  Incident  On 30 May 1990, a team of three health officers were returning to Kolkata after inspecting an immunization program in Gosaba. The team consisted of Anita Dewan, the Deputy District Extension Media Officer of the West Bengal Health Department; Uma Ghosh, a senior officer of the Health Department; and Renu Ghosh, a representative of UNICEF's World Health Organization office in New Delhi. Around 6:30 pm when they had reached Bantala near the Eastern metropolitan bypass, a group of 4-5 youths stopped their car near the local club . The driver Abani Naia made an attempt to escape, but he lost control and the car overturned. In the meantime, another gang of 10-12 youths arrived at the spot, who pulled one of the ladies out of the car, while the others pulled out the other two ladies. The driver of the car tried to resist the youths, but failed. The attackers killed the driver and set the car on fire. The lady officers were then taken to a nearby paddy field and raped. One of the ladies, who tried to resist the rapists was killed. The police brought the naked bodies of the officers to the emergency department of Calcutta National Medical College at around 11:30 pm. Initially they were presumed to be dead, but later two of them was found to be alive and were admitted for treatment. One lady doctor who examined the dead woman fainted when she discovered a metallic torch in the vagina of the officer. The injured driver was transferred to SSKM Hospital for treatment. He bore 43 wounds in his body caused by blunt, sharp and heavy weapons. His penis was smashed by the attackers. On 4 June 1990 at 5:40 am, he died. The autopsy of his body was carried out by Dr. Biswanath Kahali, a Medical Officer on Training Reserve of the Health Department.  Investigation  Prasanta Sur, the then Health Minister of West Bengal, defended the mob by contending that the victims might have been mistaken as child-abductors. But there is controversy regarding actual cause of the incident. The then Chief Minister Mr. Jyoti Basu made a casual remark regarding the incident which has strongly been criticized by the media all over India. However, the government carried out investigation and finally, the six accused in the case served life-imprisonment.

It is the second youngest unit of the Crag Group, a sequence of four geological formations spanning the Pliocene to Lower Pleistocene transition in East Anglia. It was deposited between approximately 2.4 and 1.8 million years ago, during the Gelasian Stage. The Norwich Crag is a marginal facies of the thicker, much better developed sedimentary sequence in the southern North Sea basin. It outcrops in the eastern half of the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, and is also represented in Essex and Hertfordshire. It was deposited in a near-shore environment, and comprises a range of sands, silty clays and flint- rich gravels representing various transgressive and regressive marine episodes. It rests in some places on the Red Crag Formation and in others unconformably on Coralline Crag, Palaeogene formations and Chalk Group bedrock. It is overlain by the Wroxham Crag Formation, and unconformably by the Kesgrave Catchment Subgroup (part of the Dunwich Group) and Mid Pleistocene glacigenic deposits. Norwich Crag fossil fauna and flora have been studied since the 19th century for information about environmental conditions during the early Pleistocene. They provide evidence for a general climatic cooling trend from the Pliocene to the Pleistocene.  History of research  The term Crag was first used in a geological sense by R.C. Taylor in 1823, a word commonly used in Suffolk to designate a deposit of fossil sea shellsForby, F (1830). The Vocabulary of East Anglia.

Geological section at Burgh Kiln quarry, Norfolk (Reid 1890). The Norwich Crag was first identified in the early 19th century as a predominantly marine geological formation, then thought to be of Pliocene age, outcropping from Aldeburgh to the valley of the River Bure. It was variously termed the Mammaliferous Crag (Charlesworth 1836), Norwich Crag (Lyell 1839), Norfolk Crag (Phillips 1863) and Upper Crag (Godwin-Austen 1868). Five horizons were initially recognised: the Mammaliferous Stone-Bed; the Fluvio-marine Crag; the Chillesford Crag; the Chillesford Clay; the Bure Valley Crag, including the Westleton Beds. Additional units were identified in the Norwich Crag Series, the Weybourne CragPrestwich, J (1890).

The Norwich Crag comprises a widespread sheet of well sorted, fine- to medium- grained micaceous, glauconitic, locally shelly sands (e.g. the Chillesford Sand Member), with localized beds of laminated silty clays (particularly the Chillesford Clay and Easton Bavents Clay members) and well sorted fine to medium sands with beds of rounded flint gravels (notably the Westleton Beds Member). The pebbles are predominantly composed of flint, typically more than 95% local material, either chattermarked (beach-abraded) or angular or sub- angular flint; the remaining 5% is typically white vein quartz and white quartzite.Rose, J (2007). Palaeogeography of Eastern England during the Early & Middle Pleistocene. In: Candy, I et al. The Quaternary of Northern East Anglia Field Guide. Quaternary Research Association, 2007. The heavy minerals in the sand-sized fraction of the sediment are characterised by high concentrations of garnet, amphibole and epidote, which suggests that the sands originated from eastern (continental) rather than western (British) fluvial sources.Riches, P (2012). The palaeoenvironmental and neotectonic history of the Early Pleistocene Crag basin in East Anglia. Ph.D thesis, Royal Holloway, University of London. The sandy sediments are near-shore marine deposits, with the clay members being estuarine or lagoonal, and the flint gravels are also near-shore marine, interpreted as channel infills, the gravels having been reworked from gravel beach deposits.Mottram, HB, (2017).

Plio-Pleistocene relative sea-level changes in East Anglian: evidence from the Westleton Member and related deposits. Proceedings of the Geologists' Association 110, pp.149-162. Beds of fine- grained sediment may also serve as marker horizons in the Crag Basin. Considering the lithostratigraphy to include subsurface sediments evidence by borehole, Riches (2012) proposed three major units for the Basin; most recognisable where they are separated by regressive marine marker beds of silty clay, with the uppermost equated with the Chillesford Clay Member.  Palaeogeography  Early Norwich Crag deposition in East Anglia took place within a topographical context established in the late Pliocene: an eastward dipping plain developed on Cretaceous Chalk interrupted by three SSW to NNE trending depressions partly filled with Red Crag sediments. It is conjectured that at c.2.4 million years BP the North Sea coastline lay across east Norfolk and east Suffolk, with a continuation eastwards to Holland; there were local embayments in the areas of Stalham, Bungay and Stradbroke.Funnell, BM (1996). Plio-Pleistocene Palaeogeography of the Southern North Sea Basin (3.75 - 0.60 Ma). Quaternary Science Reviews, vol.15. The North Sea was a bight at this time, with its southern margin defined by the chalk hills of the Weald-Artois anticline where the Strait of Dover is now located.Kuhlmann, G (2004). High resolution stratigraphy and paleoenvironmental changes in the southern North Sea during the Neogene : an integrated study of Late Cenozoic marine deposits from the northern part of the Dutch offshore area. Geologica Ultraiectina, Vol.245 There is evidence for later marine transgression and extension of the sea as far west as the Stansted area of Essex, associated with deposition of the Chillesford Sand Member during a period of high sea levels around two million years agoFunnell, BM (1987). Late Pliocene and Early Pleistocene stages of E Anglia and the adjacent North Sea. Quaternary Newsletter 52, June 1987 correlated with the Antian/Bramertonian Stage. This was followed by marine regression during the Baventian/Pre-Pastonian a Stage. Evidence for major rivers, the Bytham and Proto-Thames, draining into the Crag Basin at this time is represented by far-travelled material found in estuarine deposits in eastern Suffolk, the Easton Bavents Clay and Chillesford Clay Members.Hamblin, RJO, Moorlock, BSP, Booth, SJ, Jeffery, DH & Morigi, AN (1997). The Red Crag and Norwich Crag formations in eastern Suffolk. Proceedings of the Geologists’ Association, vol.1088, pp.11-23. The coastline shifted north-eastwards to a position in north-east Norfolk by about 1.75 million years BP. This later period is associated with deposition of the Wroxham Crag Formation and marked fluvial input by the Proto-Thames, Bytham River and Ancaster River systems.  Tectonic context  Since its deposition, the Norwich Crag Formation has undergone tectonic uplift and tilting as part of regional processes operating on the margins of the North Sea basin. The Chillesford Sand Member ranges in elevation from c.90 metres above sea level at Widdington, Essex, to its base at c.6 metres below sea level in the Aldeburgh-Sizewell area. There is therefore evidence for regional uplift of over 90 metres in western East Anglia and tilting towards the North Sea over the last two million years.Mathers, SJ & Zalasiewicz, JA (1988). The Pliocene to early Middle Pleistocene of East Anglia. In: Gibbard, PL & Zalasiwicz (eds). Pliocene-Middle Pleistocene of East Anglia Field Guide. Quaternary Research Association, 1988. The uplift has, however, been uneven, with little change apparent in north-east Norfolk in the West Runton – Happisburgh area. Evidence for fluctuations in relative sea level in the Crag Basin during the Plio-Pleistocene have been attributed to a variety of mechanisms including glacio-isostatic adjustments, eustatic changes and basinal response to sedimentary loading.  Fauna and flora  The fossil fauna and flora of the Norwich Crag have been studied since the early 19th century for biostratigraphic and palaeoclimatic interpretation. Taxa used include plants, molluscs, foraminifers, mammals and dinoflagellates.Head, MJ (1988). Marine environmental change in the Pliocene and early Pleistocene of eastern England: the dinoflagellate evidence reviewed. In: van Kolfschoten, T and Gibbard, PL (eds): The Dawn of the Quaternary - proceedings of the SEQS-EuroMam Symposium : Kerkrade, 16–21 June 1996. Netherlands Institute of Applied Geoscience, 1998. . They provide evidence for a general climatic cooling trend from the Pliocene into the Pleistocene. Three biostratigraphic stages have been identified based on fossil pollen assemblages: Thurnian, Antian/Bramertonian and Baventian/Pre-Pastonian a, representing a cold-warm-cold climatic sequence. Comparison with the better preserved sedimentary sequence in the Netherlands and the North Sea suggests it is unlikely that this represents a single climatic cycle but rather a sequence of episodes represented in an incomplete sedimentary record.Gibbard, PL, Gibbard, West, RG, Zagwijn, WH, Balson, PS, Burger, AW, Funnell, BM, Jeffery, DH, de Jong, J, van Kolfschoten, T, Lister, AM, Meijer, T, Norton, PEP, Preece, RC, Rose, J, Stuart, AJ, Whiteman, CA and Zalasiewicz, JA. (1991). Early and early Middle Pleistocene correlations in the southern North Sea Basin. Quaternary Science reviews, vol.10, no.1. The historic chronostratigraphic correlations and palaeoenvironmental interpretations based on biostratigraphy (local and continental) have been criticised as poorly defined and unreliable by Riches (2012). As the Norwich Crag is a marine formation, the majority of fossils found in it are of marine origin; any terrestrial species were originally blown or washed into it from land, or derived from earlier deposits, particularly the Red Crag.Spencer, HEPS (1970). A Contribution to the Geological History of Suffolk, Part 5 : The Early Pleistocene. The Crag Epochs and their Mammals. Transactions of the Suffolk Naturalists’ Society no.15, pt.4.

From a biostratigraphic point of view, the terrestrial mammal fauna of the Norwich Crag belongs to the Late Villafranchian European Land Mammal Age and is correlated with European Neogene Mammal Zone MN17. The richest and best-preserved assemblage is found in deposits of Antian/Bramertonian age at Easton Wood, Covehithe. Taxa collected from this site include proboscideans Mammuthus meridionalis and Anancus arvernensis, horse Equus robustus, deer Eucladoceros falconeri and Eucladoceros sedgwicki, gazelle Gazella anglica, beaver Trogontherium sp., wolf Canis etruscus, voles Mimomys pliocaenicus, Mimomys reidi and Mimomys tigliensis, and lemming Lemmus kowalskii.UK Fossils (undated).

Bramerton has yielded holotypes of the extinct otter Enhydra reevei and the gazelle Gazella daviesii. The whole skeleton of a mastodon is reported to have been found in the basal Stone Bed resting on Chalk at Horstead in 1820. Vole fossils from the Norwich Crag contribute to the ‘vole clock’ used for biostratigraphic zonation of Pliocene and Pleistocene sediments. For instance, Mimomys pliocaenicus is a biozonal species for European Neogene Mammal Zone MN17. Bramerton has yielded the most primitive microtine rodent assemblage known from the British Isles.Mayhew, DF & Stuart, AJ (1986).

Marine mammal fauna  Marine taxa from Easton Wood include Orca and the walrus Alachatherium cretsii. The short-beaked common dolphin Delphinus delphis and indeterminate whale bones are recorded from Holton and Thorington. = Birds = Very few avian fossils have been found in the Norwich Crag. Bones of common guillemot, little auk and various indeterminate seabird bones have been recorded from Aldeby, Chillesford, Easton Bavents and Yarn Hill.Mlikovsky, J (1995).

Pleistocene Amphibians and Reptiles in Britain and Europe. Oxford University Press. . = Fish = Fossil marine fish from the Norwich Crag include genera Chrysophrys sp. (a snapper), Acipenser (sturgeon) and Notidanus (a cow shark), and species Platax woodwardi (a batfish), Gadus morhua (Atlantic cod), Rhinoptera woodwardi (a cownose ray) and Raja clavata (thornback ray).Newton, ET (1891). The Vertebrata of the Pliocene Deposits of Britain. Memoirs of the Geological Survey of the United Kingdom, London. Teeth of the freshwater fish Esox lucius (northern pike) have been found at Bramerton. = Molluscs = Molluscan fossils are abundant at certain horizons in the Norwich Crag. Historically, they have been used to construct palaeontological zonal schemes and to infer palaeoclimatic changes.Harmer, FW 1902. A sketch of the later Tertiary history of East Anglia. Proceedings of the Geologists’ Association, vol.17. However they show evidence of considerable transportation, and consequent mixing of faunal assemblages from the earlier Red Crag Formation.Long, PE & Cambridge, PG (1988). Crag Mollusca: an overview. In: Gibbard, PL & Zalasiewicz, JA (eds). Pliocene-Middle Pleistocene of East Anglia Field Guide. Quaternary Research Association, 1988. . The use of molluscan fossils for climatic reconstruction has proved problematic. For instance species found together at several levels in the Ludham borehole notably Serripes groenlandicus (Greenland cockle) and Calyptraea chinensis (Chinese hat snail) have notably different climatic tolerances today (arctic and lusitanic respectively). The presence of mixed arctic, boreal and lusitanic faunal elements at certain levels in the Ludham borehole give no indications of the climatic fluctuations evident from foraminiferal evidence. The local variability of molluscan assemblages at similar horizons was noted by Reid as adding uncertainty to their use for biostratigraphic correlation. However, molluscan fossils have proved most useful as indicators of water depth in marine facies. Molluscan assemblages identified from Norwich Crag deposits represent a range of environments (inner sublittoral; open coast; tidal flat wadden; offshore sublittoral) and climatic conditions (boreal; low arctic; temperate). Cold climate indicator species include Astarte borealis and Yoldia myalis from Baventian deposits at Covehithe. Some species have distinct biostratigraphic value. The absence of Macoma balthica is considered to be an indicator distinguishing Norwich Crag molluscan assemblages from those of the later Wroxham Crag. Fossil shells are scarce or absent in some horizons, which may be due to contemporaneous erosion or non-deposition or post-depositional calcium carbonate solution. = Plants = A specimen of Pterocarya fraxinifolia (Caucasian wingnut) in St George's churchyard, Tombland, Norwich – a species native to the area 2 million years ago. The most complete fossil record of plant life in the Norwich Crag is provided by evidence from the Ludham research borehole. Pollen analysis in association with foraminiferan evidence allowed the identification of pollen assemblage biozones and consequent designation of five biostratigraphic stages, of which three (Thurnian, Antian and Baventian) are correlated with the Norwich Crag. The Thurnian was identified as a glacial stage with an oceanic heath type of vegetation; the Antian with temperate mixed coniferous / deciduous forest including Tsuga (hemlock) and Pterocarya (wingnut); the Baventian, a glacial stage more severe than the Thurnian, with the return of oceanic heath.West, RG, Funnell, BM, and Norton, PEP (1980). An Early Pleistocene cold marine episode in the North Sea: pollen and faunal assemblages at Covehithe, Suffolk, England. Boreas, vol.9. Further work on Norwich Crag sediments at Bramerton, Norfolk, allowed a Bramertonian stage to be identified, characterised by temperate forest with Quercus, Carpinus and Alnus. Correlation was made with the pollen assemblage from Chillesford.Funnell, BM, Norton, PEP & West, RG (1979). The crag at Bramerton, near Norwich, Norfolk. Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, B, 287, 489-534.West, RG (1980). Pleistocene Forest History in East Anglia. New Phytologist, 85 Specimens of fossil wood have occasionally been found, for example pyritised pine and oak at Holton. = Dinoflagellates = Dinoflagellate fossil assemblages have been used in the Norwich Crag as indicators of palaeoclimatic conditions, although evidence for reworking of earlier dinocysts suggests caution in interpretation.Riding, JB, Moorlock, SP, Jeffrey, DH & Hamblin, RJO (1997). Reworked and indigenous palynomorphs from the Norwich Crag Formation (Pleistocene) of eastern Suffolk: implications for provenance, palaeogeography and climate. Proceedings of the Geologists’ Association, vol. 108, pt.1. = Foraminifers = Fossil foraminifera provide important evidence for climatic and environmental interpretation and stratigraphic correlation in the Norwich Crag. The Ludham borehole has provided the most complete foraminiferal record, and has allowed the designation of seven biozones. Further biozones were identified at Bramerton and Easton Bavents, and assemblages identified at a number of other Norwich Crag sites, permitting correlation with the more complete sequence in the Netherlands.  Dating and correlations  The Norwich Crag Formation was deposited during the Gelasian Stage of the Pleistocene, between about 2.4 and 1.8 million years ago.Mathers, SJ & Hamblin, RJO (2015). Late Pliocene and Pleistocene Marine Deposits. In: Lee, JR; Woods, MA; Moorlock, BSP, eds. British Regional Geology: East Anglia (5th Edition). British Geological Survey; fig.46. . The evidence from fossil plants, mammals, molluscs, foraminifers and dinoflagellates has been used to make biostratigraphic correlations between chronostratigraphic Stages recognised in East Anglia and the more complete sequence on the Continent. Wider correlation is made with Marine Isotope Stages (MIS) and magnetostratigraphy, despite uncertainties in interpretation.Maher, B & Hallam (2005). Palaeomagnetic correlation and dating of Plio/Pleistocene sediments at the southern margins of the North Sea Basin. Journal of Quaternary Science, vol.20, pt.1. It has been noted by Riches (2012) that pollen and foraminiferan assemblages are not age diagnostic, and may not alone be sufficient to sustain reliable stratigraphy. The Thurnian Stage has been variously correlated with Stage Tiglian A or Tiglian B in the Netherlands; the Antian/Bramertonian with Tiglian C1-3 or C1-4b; the Baventian/Pre-Pastonian a with Tiglian C1-4b or C-4c. This timespan is correlated with MIS 81 to 68 or MIS 95 to 71,Kuhlmann, G et al (2006). Integrated chronostratigraphy of the Plio-Pleistocene interval and its relation to the regional stratigraphical stages in the southern North Sea region.

The discovery of chipped and flaked flints in the Norwich Crag and Red Crag basement beds in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was claimed as evidence for some of the earliest human settlement in Britain.Reid Moir, J (1927). The Antiquity of Man in East Anglia. Cambridge University Press. A typologically diagnostic form of 'eolithic' beak-shaped instrument was proposed by E Ray Lankester, the ‘rostro-carinate’, based upon a ‘Norwich Test Specimen’ flint found in the basal Norwich Crag at Colman's Pit, Whitlingham.Lankester, E Ray (1914).

Cohan, who produced it on Broadway and released by 20th Century Fox. The supporting cast features Eddie \\"Rochester\\" Anderson, Edmund Gwenn and Anne Revere. The picture's screenplay was written by George Seaton and Allan House. The plotline involves a kind lawyer (Benny) who pretends to be mean in order to further his career, which has the unforeseen repercussion of placing his romance with Lane's character in serious jeopardy. The story was filmed once before in the silent era in 1923 by First National with Bert Lytell and Blanche Sweet. Only a fragment survives of the silent. Plot Richard Clarke is a lawyer with his own legal practice in Pottsville, New York. His black paralegal assistant continuously claims that Clarke is far too nice a man to be a profitable businessman, since he always fails to demand payment from his poor clients and never takes on those he doesn't believe are innocent. But Clarke's main problem is that he is hopelessly in love with the lovely Janie Brown. Janie's wealthy father has decided that Janie will marry the even wealthier bachelor Bill Potts. Clarke remains completely oblivious of this fact. One day, after Janie and her father visited Clarke in his office, they are hit by a truck on their way home in their car. Clarke wants to impress the father, and starts to litigate against the poor farmer who drove the truck, claiming a large amount of money for the damages. But after learning that the farmer lacks funds to pay the damages, the good-hearted Clarke stops his litigation. Mr. Brown isn't impressed at all by Clarke's efforts, but he tells him that he has excellent qualities as a lawyer and should go to New York City to make better use of them. That said and done, Clarke brings his paralegal and moves to New York to start earning the big bucks. His plans come to shame, as not a single client comes to ask for his help in the first four months. Ashamed of his misfortune, he panics when he gets a message that Janie and her father are coming for a visit. Clarke desperately tries to find a more upscale apartment to impress them. While visiting a nice building, Clarke and Shufro overhear a couple arguing and leaving their apartment in anger. Clarke then occupies the apartment while the couple is gone, and receives Janie and Mr. Brown in it. Shufro is on the lookout outside, and when the couple returns to the building, Clarke takes Janie and Mr. Brown out to a nightclub. Janie is so impressed with Clarke's achievements that she wants to marry him immediately. Clarke convinces her that they should wait for a month, giving him time to secretly sort out his situation. Having spent every last cent on visiting nightclubs with Janie and her father, Clarke is forced to change his ways to get some paying clients. While practicing being mean on the street, Clarke steals a lollipop from a little boy, and unfortunately the act is captured on film by a passing photographer. The picture ends up in the newspaper the next day, with a headline that reads \\"Meanest Man In The World Takes Candy From Baby\\". After the initial shock, Clarke happily discovers that a lot of rich clients are attracted to his practice because of the article. Among others, billionaire Frederick P. Leggitt comes to visit him at the office, looking for representation for an eviction of the billionaire's old sister-in-law, Frances. After more of the same kind of \\"mean\\" publicity, hoards of clients arrive at Clarke's office and business is booming. In secret, Clarke takes care of Frances and lets her live in his apartment. Janie is appalled by Clarke's seeming new personality, and during a visit she breaks off their engagement. While Clarke is out drowning his sorrows at a bar an unfortunate series of misunderstandings regarding Frances ensue, and the public is led to believe she has taken her life in the river. Janie, who is also out drowning her sorrows, hears that Clarke lives with a woman in his apartment, and when she bumps into Clarke on the street, she slaps him in anger over his deceit. Another photographer is in place and captures the scene. The next day the picture is published, saying that Janie is the woman living with Clarke in the apartment. Mr. Brown sees the article and reacts violently. Mr. Brown forces both Clarke and Janie to go to her apartment in Pottsville. With the help of a judge, Mr. Brown makes the couple marry on the spot. Before this, Shufro has told Janie the truth about Clarke's \\"room mate\\" Frances. When the couple is married Mr. Brown orders Clarke to stay in Pottsville and reform and learn how to be less mean and a good husband. Happily Janie then explains the misunderstanding to her father.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/83172/The- Meanest-Man-in-the-World/ Cast *Jack Benny as Richard Clarke *Priscilla Lane as Janie Brown *Eddie \\"Rochester\\" Anderson as Shufro *Edmund Gwenn as Frederick P.

In the 1680s, Darejan followed her parents and brothers into exile in Russia, where she lived a semi-secluded life, mostly at her family estate of Vsekhsvyatskoye at Moscow, occupied in local charity and benevolence.  Engagement  At the age of 7, Darejan was affianced to the boy-prince Manuchar, a son of Levan III Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia. On this occasion, Manuchar arrived at the court of Darejan's grandfather, King Vakhtang V of Kartli, but, before the marriage could be consummated, the Mingrelians abducted him and brought back to his father upon being informed by Bagrat V of Imereti that Vakhtang V allegedly planned to send Manuchar as a hostage to Persia.  Life in Russia  The Vsekhsvyatskoye Church of All Saints in 2011. Darejan's family moved in Russia in 1684 and her father Archil finally established himself at Moscow after giving up all his claims to the crown of Imereti in 1699. Darejan succeeded in 1711 on the death of her brother Prince Alexander, a Russian army artillery commander, in the Swedish captivity, to the stewardship of the village of Vsekhsvyatskoye, now part of Moscow's Sokol District, which had been granted upon the Georgian family by the Russian government in 1686. Darejan spent most of her subsequent life in this estate, turning it into a Georgian émigré colony in Russia. She never married and had no children. She refrained from the courtly life and even declined in 1722 Peter the Great's personal offer to take part in the celebrations on the occasion of the treaty of Nystad with Sweden. Yet, in the 1720s, she played a role in the diplomacy between her cousin, Vakhtang VI of Kartli, and the Russian government. Her estate hosted Grand Duchess Natalya Alexeyevna, who died there of measles in 1728, and Anna Ioannovna, preparing for a stately entry into Moscow upon her selection as the empress of Russia in 1730. From 1733 to 1736, she sponsored the construction of the Church of All the Saints in Vsekhsvyatskoye, which is still extant. Darejan died in 1740 and was buried at the Donskoy Monastery.

He stood in nine Test matches between 1955 and 1969. Playing career Idrees Baig played seven first-class matches for Delhi in the Ranji Trophy between 1936 and 1946. (Delhi played only 11 matches in this period.) A middle-order batsman and fast-medium bowler, he scored one century, 106 in the victory over Gwalior in 1943–44, reaching his century in 155 minutes with 18 fours. His best bowling figures were 4 for 29 and 5 for 27 against United Provinces in 1936–37, but they were not enough to prevent a three-wicket loss in a low-scoring match. Umpiring career Baig umpired one Ranji Trophy match in 1945–46 (a few weeks after playing in his last match) and 45 first-class matches in Pakistan between 1953–54 and 1974–75. He umpired nine Tests in Pakistan: four in Pakistan’s five-match series against India in 1954–55 (the first four Tests in Pakistan), all three Tests against New Zealand in 1955–56, the single Test against Australia in 1956–57, and the First Test against New Zealand in 1969–70. He also umpired all four matches Pakistan played against the MCC in 1955–56. He was the subject of a controversial incident in Peshawar during the MCC tour of 1955–56. One evening some of the English players, fed up with what they regarded as Baig's pomposity on the field and his bias in favour of Pakistan, kidnapped him, took him back to their hotel and tipped a bucket of water over him. The incident caused outrage in Pakistan and almost led to the abandonment of the tour, but diplomacy by the MCC president, Lord Alexander, and Iskander Mirza, the president of the Board of Control for Cricket in Pakistan, smoothed things over sufficiently to allow the tour to continue.Peter Oborne, Wounded Tiger: The History of Cricket in Pakistan, Simon & Schuster, London, 2014, pp. 111-132. Peter Oborne, who has researched the incident, doubts if the suggestions of bias were valid. He points out, for example, that Henry Cooper, who managed the New Zealand cricket team that toured Pakistan in 1955, had singled out Baig as the best of the Pakistan umpires, calling him \\"first rate\\".Oborne, pp. 130-131. Baig does seem to have been more than usually vain, however; he told the MCC team's manager that people came to his matches to watch him umpire.Oborne, p. 116.

Solchaga continued Boyer's moderation and orthodox economy approach. It was partly because they did not fit into the socialist mould the government projected. Their priority was to reduce inflation using steps to control the money supply, which reinforced the high levels of interest and a strong currency. In addition, like Boyer he objected the approach and views of Alfonso Guerra, then deputy prime minister.

The fifth tropical cyclone and named storm, as well as the fourth hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Erick originated from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on June 18\\\\. The wave tracked swiftly westward with little development, emerging into the eastern Pacific on July 1\\\\. As a result of favorable environmental conditions, the wave developed into a tropical depression on July 4, and further into Tropical Storm Erick at 0000 UTC on July 5\\\\. Steered generally west-northwest, Erick intensified into a Category 1 hurricane and reached its peak intensity with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) on July 6\\\\. Its proximity to land and track over increasingly cooler waters caused the storm to deteriorate into a tropical storm the following day, though it remained at such intensity until degenerating into a remnant low early on July 9\\\\. The remnant circulation dissipated a few hours later, southwest of Baja California Sur. In preparation for the cyclone, numerous tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued for various portions of the coastline of Mexico. Ports were closed and residents in low-lying areas were asked to evacuate to higher grounds. In addition, shipping by means of boat was suspended. Though the center of Erick remained offshore, the outer bands of the system brought gusty winds and isolated heavy rainfall to Western Mexico. In Guerrero, minor flooding was reported in the cities of Acapulco and Puerto Marques. A river overflowed its banks in Nayarit, flooding several cities in the state. Numerous cars, streets, and homes were damaged by flooding. A woman died as she attempted to flee her house, while a man was killed after being swept away by the river. Hundreds of people were rescued by the Mexican military and Nayarit officials. Across Baja California Sur, the storm produced widespread precipitation, leading to flooding. Meteorological history On June 18, a tropical wave emerged off the western coastline of Africa and into the eastern Atlantic. Tracking steadily westward, it maintained a small but organized area of convection—shower and thunderstorm activity—along its axis for the next several days. The wave crossed the Lesser Antilles on June 24 and Central America on June 29, emerging into the eastern Pacific shortly thereafter. During the evening of July 1, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system, noting that environmental conditions were expected to become favorable for slow development. The wave interacted with a larger area of low pressure on July 2, leading to an increase in convective coverage and the formation of a broad low-pressure area. Continuing slowly westward, the system acquired enough organization to be declared a tropical depression at 1200 UTC on July 4, while centered 205 mi (330 km) southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. Despite the initially exposed center of circulation, a byproduct of moderate wind shear, the depression soon began to organize as convective banding increased and gained more curvature. This led to the classification of Tropical Storm Erick at 0000 UTC on July 5. Under the influence of a mid-level ridge over the northwestern Caribbean Sea and an upper-level ridge over the southwestern United States, the newly upgraded Erick tracked west-northwest parallel to the coastline of Mexico. A central dense overcast formed by the daylight hours of July 5, with tight banding noted on satellite. In addition, microwave imagery indicated the formative stages of an eyewall. Initially vertically decoupled, the storm became more vertically aligned throughout the following hours. A ragged eye became intermittently visible on satellite, and Erick was upgraded to Category 1 hurricane status at 0600 UTC, located approximately 105 mi (170 km) west-southwest of Lázaro Cárdenas, Mexico. In conjunction with satellite intensity estimates, it is estimated that Erick attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 983 mb (hPa; 29.03 inHg) at 1200 UTC. Shortly thereafter, its proximity to the coastline of Mexico and track over increasingly cooler waters caused the storm to begin a weakening trend. At 1800 UTC on July 7, Erick weakened to a tropical storm as its associated convective mass warmed and the eye deteriorated. Wind shear caused the center of circulation to become exposed on July 9 as the system passed just south of Baja California Sur, leading to degeneration into a remnant low-pressure area at 0600 UTC. The remnant vortex persisted for a few more hours, before dissipating over cold sea surface temperatures at 0000 UTC on July 10. Preparations and impact Tropical Storm Erick weakening offshore Jalisco on July 7 Following the system's designation, a tropical storm watch was issued for the southwestern coastline of Mexico stretching from Acapulco to La Fortuna. By 0300 UTC on July 5, the watch was extended from Acapulco to Manzanillo, while a tropical storm warning was issued from Lázaro Cárdenas to Manzanillo. Several hours later, the watch was discontinued for the coastline stretching from Acapulco to Lázaro Cárdenas and issued from La Fortuna to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. Meanwhile, the warning from Lázaro Cárdenas to Manzanillo was discontinued, with a new warning issued from Zihuatanejo to La Fortuna. All tropical storm watches in effect were discontinued by 0300 UTC the following morning, with the warning being extended from Zihuatanejo to Cabo Corrientes. After being upgraded to a hurricane, Erick prompted the issuance of hurricane watches stretching from Punta San Telmo to Cabo Corrientes. At 1500 UTC on July 6, a tropical storm watch was issued from Santa Fe to La Paz, though this was upgraded to a warning several hours later. Following many other revisions, all tropical cyclone watches and warnings were discontinued after Erick degenerated into a remnant low early on July 9. In preparation for the tropical cyclone, an \\"orange\\" alert was issued for southern Michoacán, southern Jalisco, and the entire state of Colima, while a \\"yellow\\" alert was posted for the rest of the Jalisco coastline. The ports of Acapulco, Zihuatanejo, and Manzanillio were closed. In fear of flash flooding, residents along low-lying areas of Acapulco were urged to evacuate. Meanwhile, the government of Michoacán ordered the suspension of shipping by boat. Despite remaining offshore, the outer rainbands of the storm affected the southwestern coastline with gusty winds and heavy rainfall, with similar effects farther northwest. In Acapulco and Puerto Marques, the storm was responsible for minor flooding. Elsewhere across the state, damage was minor and mostly due to landslides. Along the coast of Colima, waves up to were recorded. Although some flooding was reported across the state, damage was considered minor. Further north, Erick brought extensive flood damage to Nayarit. A 74-year-old woman died while trying to escape her flooded house, while dozens of vehicles were damaged and several other streets and homes were flooded. One river overflowed its banks, affecting numerous cities. Officials in Nayarit attempted to rescue hundreds of people affected by Hurricane Erick, many of whom waited on streets to be rescued. Dozens of families were directly affected by the storm. Substantial amounts of debris piled up on streets. Residents reported severe economical losses, especially in Xalisco, where a disaster declaration was necessary. Offshore, a waterspout was reported. In Tepic, Governor Roberto Sandoval ordered a state of emergency. Although the core of the system remained offshore, a \\"yellow\\" alert was issued for Baja California Sur. Heavy rain was recorded over much of the peninsula, resulting in flooding. The ports of La Paz, Cabo San Lucas, and San Jose del Cabo were closed due to high waves. Additionally, a \\"green\\" alert was issued for Baja California. In all, two people were killed while two others were missing.

(\\"Sitting volleyball rules,\\" 2012) In the rules it says all players must have one buttocks of the floor while making contact with the ball in play. There are no guidelines as to what type of ailment makes you eligible to play in this new form of the sport. Amputees, spinal cord injuries, cerebral palsy, brain injuries and strokes are just some of the conditions these players live with. All of whom are athletes by every definition of the word. Starting in 2006, Holloway competed in the Sitting Volleyball Championship in Roermond, the Netherlands placing in fifth. Every year following she competed and won several medals in the sport. In 2007, she won a silver medal, in the Sitting Volleyball Invitational which took place in Shanghai, China.

Located in the northern section of the park, Custer Ridge rises to the west of Silver Lake, north-northwest of Mount Spickard. The high point along Custer Ridge is a peak tentatively named Mount Custer, which lies near the southwestern end of the ridge. Custer Ridge extends beyond the Canada–US border. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

These four main components of the plant have important morphological roles: leaves take in CO2 and energy from the sun to create carbon compounds, stems grow above competitors to reach sunlight, roots absorb water and mineral nutrients from the soil while anchoring the plant, and reproductive parts facilitate the continuation of species. Plants partition biomass in response to limits or excesses in resources like sunlight, carbon dioxide, mineral nutrients, and water and growth is regulated by a constant balance between the partitioning of biomass between plant parts. An equilibrium between root and shoot growth occurs because roots need carbon compounds from photosynthesis in the shoot and shoots need nitrogen absorbed from the soil by roots. Allocation of biomass is put towards the limit to growth; a limit below ground will focus biomass to the roots and a limit above ground will favor more growth in the shoot. Plants photosynthesize to create carbon compounds for growth and energy storage. Sugars created through photosynthesis are then transported by phloem using the pressure flow system and are used for growth or stored for later use. Biomass partitioning causes this sugar to be divided in a way that maximizes growth, provides the most fitness, and allows for successful reproduction. Plant hormones play a large part in biomass partitioning since they affect differentiation and growth of cells and tissues by changing the expression of genes and altering morphology. By responding to environmental stimuli and partitioning biomass accordingly, plants are better able to take in resources from their environmental and maximize growth.  Abiotic Factors of Partitioning  Liebig's Barrel with water running out of the lowest slat.It is important for plants to be able to balance their absorption and utilization of available resources and they adjust their growth in order to acquire more of the scarce, growth-limiting resources: sunlight, carbon dioxide, mineral nutrients, and water. The equilibrium of biomass partitioning can be explained by Liebig's Law of the Minimum and modeled through the metaphor of Liebig's Barrel in which the limiting resource of plant growth is like the shortest slat on a barrel full of water. The barrel can only hold water up to the level of the shortest slat and, likewise, plants can only grow at a rate allowed by the limiting resource. To continue growing, biomass must be partitioned to help sequester these resources. = Sunlight = The main light-sensing mechanism for plants is the phytochrome system with pigments located throughout the plant to detect changes in red and far-red light. The phytochromes' detection of light quality is what helps trigger changes in biomass partitioning. Plants grown in low light conditions have been shown to allocate more biomass to shoots (mainly leaves). By measuring leaf area of plants at different levels of irradiance or sunlight, it has been determined that lower levels of light cause total plant leaf surface to increase. If sunlight is limiting the plant increases growth to the shoot and decreases the energy partitioned to the roots because the lower rates of photosynthesis lessen need for water and mineral nutrients. As low light causes greater allocation to the shoot, the same correlation is made for plants in high light; higher irradiance causes smaller total lower surface area because less surface area is needed to absorb sunlight. When a plant has more than enough photosynthetic capacity, it will instead prioritize growth in the roots to absorb water and nutrients. = Carbon Dioxide = In a situation where carbon is the limiting resource, increasing the levels of CO2 increases photosynthetic rates. This will also cause increases in nutrient uptake and water use, focusing more growth towards the roots. In low CO2 concentrations, plants create larger and more numerous leaves to bring in more CO2. The impacts of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration on biomass partitioning is important to understanding in impacts on plants in the face of climate change. Plant cells have increased carbon to nitrogen ratios when CO2 concentrations are higher, which decreases levels of decomposition. The decrease in decomposition caused by high carbon dioxide concentrations has the effect of decreasing nitrogen availability for plants.Fertilized barley (above) and unfertilized barley (below). Shoots of the unfertilized barley are slightly shorter and less full. = Mineral Nutrients = Overall, nutrient availability has a strong effect on partitioning, with plants growing in poor nutrient areas partitioning most of their biomass to underground structures. Soil nitrogen availability, for example, is a strong determinant of biomass allocation. For example, in low productivity systems (low levels of soil nitrogen) such as boreal forests, trees devote a large portion of their biomass to roots. But as soil productivity increases, biomass is primarily allocated to aboveground structures such as leaves and stems. As an overall pattern, the lengths of roots decrease as nutrient concentrations increase. High concentrations of a mineral nutrient that lead to toxicity can have a strong effect on growth and partitioning as well. For instance, in toxic concentrations of cadmium and lead, Fagus sylvatica was shown to develop a more compact and less branching root system while establishing few root hairs. This altered structure functions to reduce surface area of the roots and the effects of toxic nutrients while also conserving biomass for parts of the plant where growth would be more beneficial. = Water = Plants grown in dry conditions often have a decreased total biomass production but they also contribute more of their biomass to the roots and develop a higher root to shoot ratio. When plants allocate more of their biomass to their roots, they are able to enhance water absorption by tapping further down into the water table and extending root mass further laterally. Increased root hairs also aid in increasing absorption. When there is an extreme soil drought, there is not an increase in root to shoot biomass, because a state of dormancy is adopted. Water availability also impacts leaf surface area as too much surface area could allow for excessive transpiration in low water conditions.  Biotic Factors of Partitioning  Interactions between organisms can also alter partitioning due to competition for resources, sharing of resources, or reduction of plant biomass. = Competition = Interspecific and intraspecific competition can cause a decrease in the available resources for an individual plant and alter how it partitions biomass. For instance, competition between plants causes decreased radial growth in branches and the stem while increasing growth of the roots and height of the stem. This provides reasoning for the importance of phenotypic plasticity in maintaining fitness in a competitive environment; the better a plant is at altering its morphology, the more competitive it will be.The fungus gives the plant water and nutrients while the plant gives the fungus sugars from photosynthesis. = Mutualism With Mycorrhizae = The relationship between plants and mycorrhizal fungi is an example of mutualism because plants provides fungi with carbohydrates and mycorrhizal fungi help plants absorb more water and nutrients. Since mycorrhizal fungi increase plants' uptake of below-ground resources, plants who form a mutualistic relationship with fungi have stimulated shoot growth and a higher shoot to root ratio. = Herbivory = Herbivory causes a short-term reduction in leaf mass and/or stem mass that shifts stability and proportions of plant parts. To restore the balance between uptake of nutrients/water and photosynthetic rates, plants send more energy to the stems and leaves. Herbivory causing high levels of defoliation (greater than 25% of leaf area) increases growth to the shoot, seeking to achieve the same shoot to root ratio as before defoliation. Therefore, defoliation also reduces root growth and nutrient uptake until the before- defoliation root to shoot ratio is restored.  Plant Type  As different plants have different structures and growth forms, their partitioning of biomass is not identical either. For example, evergreen trees have higher leaf mass fractions (LMFs) compared to deciduous trees. Additionally, the stem to root ratio varies between species more greatly in herbaceous plants than woody ones as the plasticity for roots in herbaceous plants is higher. Furthermore, herbaceous monocots or graminoids compared with herbaceous dicots have larger root to total mass ratios (RMFs). The difference in herbaceous monocots and dicots may be explained by differences in efficiency of nutrient uptake or by the need for graminoids to store more starch and nutrients to regrow after fire or grazing. Biomass partitioning can also be affected by a plant's method of carbon fixation: C3 or C4. For herbaceous monocots, the type of photosynthesis does not affect the percentile LMF or RMF, but in herbaceous dicots, C4 species have lower RMFs. The life cycle of plants can also cause different allocation strategies and ratios for leaves, roots, and stems; compared to same-size eudicotelydonous perennials, annuals put more energy into growing leaves and stems than perennial species.  Age  Biomass partitioning patterns can also change as plants age. In pinus strobus stands of 2, 15, 30, and 65 years old, the root to shoot ratio was 0.32, 0.24, 0.16, and 0.22 respectively showing a decrease in root mass compared to shoot mass in the first few decades of growth. Age also affects how trees partition biomass to different components of the stem. Growth of branches and leaf surface area decreases with age as partitioning to the trunk increases.  Methods/ Measurement  Many biomass partitioning studies consist of manipulative experiments that increase or reduce levels of growth-limiting resources and observe the effects. Often-times these studies use potted plants grown in a greenhouse to measure effects of density, excess nutrients, low light etc. Other studies may focus on observation and analysis of naturally occurring plants or use data analysis of previous measurements. The methods and measurements for determining biomass partitioning can be quite difficult due to the weight and volume of larger plants. Furthermore, measuring size and weight of roots entails washing and careful removal of soil to get accurate measurements. Plant biomass is often measured in terms of leaf mass fraction (LMF), stem mass fraction (SMF), and root mass fraction (RMF) where the dry mass of the plant part is set over the total dry mass of the plant. Lateral, radial, and height increases are used to quantify rates of growth.

He also served as the Angevin bailli in the Principality of Achaea from 1297 to 1300.PLP 24307  Biography  Richard is generally thought to be the son of , Count palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos, and a daughter of the sebastokrator John Komnenos Doukas.Bon (1969), p. 706 However, given the long period between the beginning of Matthew's reign in the first years of the 13th century and the attested date of Richard's death, it is possible that another character is to be intercalated between Matthew and Richard, perhaps the \\"count Theodore\\" referred to in a document from 1264 (possibly Matthew's son and Richard's father).Kiesewetter (2006), p. 352 It is unclear when exactly Richard became Count palatine; he is not specifically recorded by name in a document until 1264.Nicol (2010), p. 36 However, according to the testimony of the later chronicler Marino Sanudo Torcello, he was still a minor around 1262, when William II of Villehardouin assumed the regency for the county after his return from Byzantine captivity.Kiesewetter (2006), p. 352, citing Sanudo, Istoria (ed. Hopf, Chroniques gréco-romanes) p. 116 Some authors date his accession as early as 1238, the date of the last document referring to Matthew Orsini, often assumed as the date of his death. If so, Richard was then perhaps the \\"Count of Cephalonia\\" referred to in a Venetian attempt to form an alliance of the Frankish rulers of Greece in aid of the beleaguered Latin Empire of Constantinople.Setton (1975), pp. 91, 501. Text in Norden, Das Papsttum und Byzanz pp.759-760 Already since his father's time, the county palatine was a vassal of the Principality of Achaea, and through it, after the Treaty of Viterbo, of the Kingdom of Naples. In this capacity he also held the post of Captain-General of Corfu and Butrint on the Albanian shore in 1286–90. In 1291/92, he participated with 100 knights in a campaign to aid the ruler of Epirus, Nikephoros I Komnenos Doukas, against the Byzantines who were besieging Ioannina, along with 400–500 cavalry from Achaea under Nicholas III of Saint Omer. In exchange, Nikephoros sent his daughter, Maria, as a hostage to Cephalonia. After the Byzantines were repelled, she was wed to Richard's son and heir, John I Orsini. This aroused the indignation of Nikephoros, who had not been consulted, and who was not mollified until 1295, when the young couple came to live at his court.Bon (1969), p. 167Nicol (2010), pp. 40, 43 Following the death of the Prince of Achaea, Florent of Hainaut, his widow, Princess Isabella of Villehardouin appointed Richard to rule in her stead as bailli and withdrew to the castle of Kalamata.Bon (1969), pp. 170–171 His tenure appears to have been peaceful as regards the conflict with the Byzantine Greeks of Mystras, but the issue of the succession remained open as Isabella had but one daughter, Matilda of Hainaut (born 1293). On the suggestion of Richard Orsini, the young heiress of Achaea was engaged to the young Duke of Athens, Guy II de la Roche. Their marriage took place in 1305.Bon (1969), pp. 171–172Longnon (1969), p. 265 Richard kept his post until 1300, when he was replaced by Nicholas III of Saint Omer, at the advice of chancellor Benjamin of Kalamata. This began a period of rivalry between Richard and Benjamin; in 1303, Richard's friends at court persuaded Prince Philip of Savoy to detain Benjamin, who was released after paying 20,000 hyperpyra as ransom. In turn, Benjamin gained the ear of the Prince, and forced Richard to give up the same sum in exchange for possession of half a village, which returned to the princely domain following Richard's death.Bon (1969), pp. 173, 175–176 Richard was killed in 1303 or 1304 by one of his own knights, a man named Lion.Bon (1969), p. 176Nicol (2010), p. 53 note 82  Family  Richard married twice: his first wife is unknown, and his second, in 1299, was Margaret of Villehardouin, sister of Princess Isabella. From the first marriage, he had four children: a son, John I Orsini, and three daughters. His three daughters all married into the high nobility of Achaea: one, Guillerme, married the Grand Constable John Chauderon, who died in 1294, and after that Nicholas III of Saint Omer; the second married John of Durnay, Baron of Gritzena; and the third married Engilbert of Liederkerque, a nephew of the Prince Florent of Hainaut, who succeeded Chauderon as Constable.Bon (1969), pp. 168, 171, 706 From the second marriage, Richard had a daughter, but she died as an infant.

General information  The phenomenon is known also under the names of \\"stability loss delay for dynamical bifurcations\\" and \\"ghost attractor\\". The essence of the effect of bifurcation memory lies in the appearance of a special type of transition process. An ordinary transition process is characterized by asymptotic approach of the dynamical system from the state defined by its initial conditions to the state corresponding to its stable stationary regime in the basin of attraction of which the system found itself. However, near the bifurcation boundary can be observed two types of transition processes: passing through the place of the vanished stationary regime, the dynamic system slows down its asymptotic motion temporarily, \\"as if recollecting the defunct orbit\\", with the number of revolutions of the phase trajectory in this area of bifurcation memory depending on proximity of the corresponding parameter of the system to its bifurcation value, — and only then the phase trajectory rushes to the state that corresponds to stable stationary regime of the system. In the literature, the effect of bifurcation memory is associated with a dangerous \\"bifurcation of merging\\". The twice repeated bifurcation memory effects in dynamical systems were also described in literature; they were observed, when parameters of the dynamical system under consideration were chosen in the area of either crossing two different bifurcation boundaries, or their close neighbourhood.  The known definitions  It is claimed that the term \\"bifurcation memory\\":  History of studying  The earliest of those described on this subject in the scientific literature should be recognized, perhaps, the result presented in 1973, which was obtained under the guidance of , a Soviet academician, and which initiated then a number of foreign studies of the mathematical problem known as \\"stability loss delay for dynamical bifurcations\\". A new wave of interest in the study of the strange behaviour of dynamic systems in a certain region of the state space has been caused by the desire to explain the non-linear effects revealed during the getting out of controllability of ships. Subsequently, similar phenomena were also found in biological systems — in the system of blood coagulation and in one of the mathematical models of myocardium.  Topicality  The topicality of scientific studies of the bifurcation memory is obviously driven by the desire to prevent conditions of reduced controllability of the vehicle. In addition, the special sort of tachycardias connected with the effects of bifurcation memory are considered in cardiophysics.

Located in the northern section of the park, Mox Peaks consist of several summits in close proximity to each other that are nearly the same altitude, but the highest point is the eastern peak. Mox Peaks West looms just to the southeast of Redoubt Glacier and is at the southern terminus of a long arête which extends to Mount Spickard to the northeast. A deep col lies between Mox Peaks High Point and Mox Peaks West. Climate Mox Peaks is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Relying primarily on archive footage and interviews, and without a narrative voiceover, the film recounts the endemic poverty in prewar Britain, the sense of optimism that followed victory in World War II and the subsequent expansion of the welfare state, founding of the National Health Service and nationalisation of significant parts of the UK's economy. The film documents the extent to which these achievements, as Loach sees them, have since been subject to attack in the decades that followed, particularly under the Conservative governments of Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s. Loach said that the model for the film was \\"oral history, with pictures\\". Reception Time Out described it as consisting of a \\"compelling mix of interviews, both old and new\\", while noting that the theme of the film was as much about \\"the spirit of modern Britain\\" and implicit criticism of modern-day politicians, both Labour and Conservative. Reviewing the film for The Observer, Philip French described it as \\"skilfully compiled\\" but sentimental and simplistic rather than \\"the provocative polemic one might have expected\\". Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian acknowledged that the film could be seen as \\"patrician- nostalgist\\" but said he was \\"swept along by the calm simplicity of its presentation\\".

Descended from the first ruler of the Malayapura Kingdom, King Adityawarman whom is also known as Seri Maharaja Diraja which to a later stage sparked the start of Minangkabau history in Pagaruyung Kingdom, Sumatra, Indonesia. These story has been greatly narrated in most of old Malay Literature including in of the most reliable sources to date called Sulalatus al-Salatin (The Genealogy of The Sultans) or better known as The Malay Annals (Malay: Sejarah Melayu). The manuscript begin with the stories of Wan Malini and Wan Empuk whom was presented with 3 adopted princes right after when their rice fields was magically expelling gold.Sulalatus Salatin - Compiled and arranged by Tun Sri Lanang and reinterpretations by A. Samad Ahmad - Dewan Bahasa & Pustaka (DBP), 1977 from the copy of Raja Bongsu; MS. 18 Sir Stamford Raffles; Singapore; 1953 These 3 princes was later mark as the kickstart for the next 3 big empires in Malay Archipelago. Those empires were the Kingdom of Majapahit (Java Island), The Malacca Sultanate (Malay Peninsula) and the Pagaruyung Kingdom (Sumatra, Indonesia) around the 12th century. According to the studies on Malay old manuscripts and literatures, this form of martial arts called 'Silat' has been practiced from one generation to another since the beginning days of Malacca Sultanate era and made popular by the legendary Malay warrior known as Hang Tuah, Hang Jebat, Hang Kasturi, Hang Lekir and Hang Lekiu whom learned from their grand master Aria Putra (or some called Adi Putra) whom resided in Gunung Ledang; (English: Mount Ophir) in Malacca. In The Epic of Hang Tuah literature, it is stated that these 5 warriors later learned from Aria Putra elder brother whom resided in the mount Wirana Pura in Java Island. During the 15th century, this form of martial arts was later being brought to the State of Perak (one of the states in Malaysia) by Dato' Bendahara Paduka Diraja Megat Terawis,Megat Terawis: The 18th Generation Legacies - (Malay articles) Faizal Riduan Milenia Muslim Magazine ; January; Kuala Lumpur; 2009 the first installed Prime Minister come 'Admiral' for the state of Perak, in which the legacy was heritage from the falling Malacca Sultanate Empire after the Portuguese conquest in 1511.

Origin  Talang Tuwo inscription from the Pagaruyung Kingdom The silat tradition is mostly oral, having been passed down almost entirely by word of mouth. In the absence of written records, much of its history is known only through myth and archaeological evidence. It is believed that this form of martial arts has been developed during the beginning days of human inhabitant around the developments of Bukit Siguntang Mahameru Kingdom in Palembang, Sumatra. As narrated in the Malay Annals, the beginning of the Malay empire, started with a story of Paduka Demang Lebar Daun and Sang Nila Utama which took place in Batang Musi River. Paduka Demang Lebar Daun was officially styled as the forefather (Mangkubumi) of all the Malay peoples in Malay Archipelago by Sang Nila Utama through their oath. From the Bukit Siguntang Kingdom it has later developed into a full-grown three gigantic empires in Malay Archipelago history. One of them is the Pagaruyung Kingdom under the rule of King Adityawarman around the 12th century. As mentioned by Professor Dr. Buya Hamka in his historical book entitled Islam and the Minangkabau Culture, King Adityawarman was bought into Islam in the hands of Sheikh Abdullah AriffSejarah Umat Islam; Volume 1, 2 & 3 - Professor Dr. Buya Hamka; ; Pustaka Nasional Pte.

According to scholars' studies, Sheikh Abdullah was among the first few Arabs to travel to the Malay Archipelago area in the 12th century. This affair later became a trend which attracted more and more Muslim scholars and saints to travel to the Malay Archipelago area including members of the holy house for the Islamic prophet Muhammad or better known as Ahlul Bayt. Most of them later did find their settlement here. One of the most famous saint among them is Sheikh Sunan Maulana Ishak or better known among the Malays as Wali Solo. From there, it is said that the form of martial arts carried by King Adityawarman has developed and enhanced with Islamic beliefs and rituals among its traditions.

The blessing scam, also called the \\"ghost scam\\" or \\"jewelry scam\\", is a confidence trick typically perpetrated against elderly women of Chinese origin. The scam originated in China and Hong Kong and victims have fallen to it worldwide including in Chinatowns and overseas Chinese communities. The object of the scam is to persuade the victim to put valuables into a bag, which the perpetrator then secretly swaps for a different bag, enabling them to take the valuables. Operation of the scam The scam typically requires three people. One approaches the victim and casually begins a conversation, introducing the topic of a certain healer, herbalist, traditional doctor or psychic. The second con artist, a shill, appears to coincidentally overhear the conversation, and states that they know of and have been helped by the healer in — for example, that the healer cured their broken hand or healed their mother after a stroke. This provides social proof, lending credibility to the first con artist's depiction of the healer's powers. The two then persuade the mark to visit the healer. In some variants, they happen upon a relative of the healer who also is purported to have special powers; in others, they meet the healer himself. The healer then states that a ghost or spirit is following the mark, and that a family member is in danger or some other ill is about to befall them. The healer offers to perform a blessing ritual to get rid of the evil spirits or ghost. The purported blessing ceremony requires the mark to put valuables in the bag, reflecting the common religious theme of needing to provide something of value in order to gain blessings. The mark is encouraged to put as much valuable content in the bag as possible. A prayer is then said over the bag containing the valuables, and the mark is reassured that the ghost has been banished, but that to preserve the effect they should not open the bag for some long amount of time. Unbeknownst to the target of the scam, the bag containing the valuables was swapped during the ceremony for an identical bag containing valueless objects — newspaper instead of cash, for example. When the target opens the bag a month later, they realize that they have been scammed out of all their money.  Communities targeted Overseas Chinese elderly women are believed to be targeted for several reasons : 1\\\\. non-reliance on banks – They are likely to have large amounts of cash in their homes rather than in savings accounts. 2\\\\. social isolation – They often do not speak English, and so are more willing to talk to a stranger who approaches them speaking their own language. 3\\\\. spiritual beliefs – In the religious traditions prevalent in these communities, it is believable that a healer would be able to spot bad energy and use a ceremony to remove it. 4\\\\. shame culture – When they are scammed out of their life savings, they are less likely to go to the police or warn their communities because they are ashamed of having been fooled. 5\\\\. filial piety – There is a strong sense of duty as a parent to protect their family from harm. These scams have been reported in San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, England, Turkey, Scotland, Australia, and New Zealand. One source states that the suspects in one case had also traveled to Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Brunei and Cambodia. Over the course of a year, reported cases of the scam have cost San Franciscans alone over $1.5 million. Law enforcement response San Francisco issued a public safety alert which, along with media publicity, led a mark to recognize the scam and go to the police. The prosecution was controversial because the scammers claimed they were being forced by organized crime bosses to operate the scam, or their relatives would be harmed.

It is a candidate outlying member of the Sculptor Group, a gravitationally-bound group of galaxies. This galaxy was discovered in 1798 by German-English astronomer William Herschel, then re- discovered and catalogued by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop. It was first photographed in 1912, which revealed the spiral form of the nebula. During the twentieth century, radio telescope observations showed that a linear feature in the nucleus was a relatively strong source of radio emission. NGC 613 is inclined by an angle of 37° to the line of sight from the Earth along a position angle of 125°. The morphological classification of NGC 613 is SBbc(rs), indicating that it is a spiral galaxy with a bar across the nucleus (SB), a weak inner ring structure circling the bar (rs), and moderate to loosely wound spiral arms (bc). The bar is relatively broad but irregular in profile with a position angle that varies from 115–124° and dust lanes located along the leading edges. Star formation is occurring at the ends of the bar and extending along the well-defined spiral arms. The central bulge is readily apparent, with a radius of 14″. The classification of the nucleus is of type HII, indicating a match to the spectrum of an H II region. Near the core, the stars have a velocity dispersion of 136 ± 20 km/s. The nucleus is a source of radio emission with the form of an inner ring with a radius of about and a linear feature that is perhaps perpendicular to it. The latter consists of three discrete blobs spanning approximately . Observations suggest the presence of a supermassive black hole at the core with a mass in the range times the mass of the Sun. On September 20, 2016, Argentinian amateur astronomer Victor Buso captured supernova SN 2016gkg in NGC 613, just as it was starting to erupt. This was a type IIb supernova, a supernova that initially shows a hydrogen envelope like a type II supernova, but later loses the hydrogen lines in its spectrum to appear like a type Ib supernova. It showed the double peak that is common to many type IIb supernovae, rising to around magnitude 15.5 shortly after discovery and then again about 20 days later. The progenitor star has been identified in Hubble Space Telescope images from before its collapse, and it is likely to have been a yellow supergiant.

Character Summary  In this episode, Serena throws Blair a bridal shower that turns into a disaster. Here is a description of what happened with each character: Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively): Serena throws Blair a bridal shower. She keeps the theme a secret until Blair shows and finds that the party is a Tiffany- themed party; just what Blair would want. Serena also has the list of who has tipped something off to Gossip Girl sent by Nate, but refuses to sell out her friends. She begins seeing Max at the end of the episode. Nate Archibald (Chace Crawford): Nate struggles with his relationship with Diana through the whole episode. He wants to help her save her job at the Spectator but when the way to save her was selling out all of his friends who tipped off to Gossip Girl, he decided not to tell her that he had the list in the first place. After telling Serena this, Diana enters his office after overhearing his decision. He convinces Diana not to publish the page. At the end of the episode, Nate is named editor-in-chief of the Spectator after his grandfather, William van der Bilt, fires Diana and reveals to Nate that he is a sole investor in the newspaper. Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester): Blair has major anxiety about her shower but turns out to love it when she arrives. Her and Louis are seen fighting throughout the episode. Eventually, after Blair finds that Louis published the list of tips and that Louis's sister sent a tip to Gossip Girl about her paternity test, she asks Louis to leave her alone so she can figure out if she still wants to marry him. Also, she realizes that the only reason Chuck kissed her at the party in the previous episode, \\"The Big Sleep No More,\\" was to push Blair towards Louis. Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick): Chuck has realized that he is now an outsider in the Upper East Side as Blair's wedding date inches closer and closer. He spends time with his dog, Monkey, and even hangs out with Dan, who also an outsider. He struggles with his eternal feelings for Blair and tries to stay away from her wedding shower. Ivy Dickens (Kaylee DeFer): Ivy AKA Charlie is trying hard to conceal the truth from her family. The arrival of her ex-boyfriend Max makes this especially difficult. Truth almost comes out when Max shows up at the van der Woodsen's penthouse but Charlie lies her way out again. Max knows that she is lying to everyone and accepts Charlie's offer to pay him off in exchange for his departure. At the end of the episode, Max calls Charlie and tells her he is staying in town longer to pursue Serena and that he wants more money from her. Daniel Humphrey (Penn Badgely): Dan is feeling the effects of a failed book and tries to blame it on Serena. He tries to distract himself from the fact that he wasn't invited to Blair's party by seeking help from Chuck. Dan listens to Chuck's advice about being a man of action and crashes Blair's party. Chuck takes an inebriated Dan to his penthouse after the party.

Charlie enters and Lily asks for an explanation. Charlie seems like she's going to come clean, but continues lying. She says that Carol Rhodes made her change her name so that she wouldn't be burdened with the Rhodes name and so that people like Max would like her for her.

Background Jennifer Yee began her culinary career by working as a pastry commis chef for Gordon Ramsay and Angela Hartnett at the Connaught Hotel, while attending London's Le Cordon Bleu, 2002-2003. After completing her Patisserie Diploma with Distinction at Cordon Bleu, Yee stayed on in London as pastry chef de partie at Alan Yau's Yauatcha.

While heading up the pastry department at the Michelin-starred mid-town New York restaurant, Yee was awarded the Star Chefs 'Rising Star' award for pastry, in 2010. Following Chef Lee's departure from Aureole, Yee was offered the opportunity to work with Australian chef Shaun Hergatt at his fine dining establishment, SHO Shaun Hergatt, in Manhattan's Financial District. While SHO garnered much critical praise, and two stars from Michelin, the restaurant closed its doors in 2012, but not before Yee's refined pastry program had caught the eye of the dessert-focused media, noting her \\"artful\\" desserts and \\"best petits fours in New York City\\".Dessert Buzz May 2012 After the closure of SHO, Chef Yee was offered her most high-profile and challenging position to date as the Patissière for Andrew Carmellini's latest project, the French Grand Cafe and Bakery, Lafayette, which opened in April 2013.

Since the times of the Jesuit Academy professors and students used to pray here, and Vilnius theologians gave sermons. It was a place for performances and disputes, where theses were defended and kings greeted. History The church was built in 1388–1426, reconstructed in the 16th and 17th centuries. The tower, separate from the church itself, was built in the 16th century. After the fire in 1737, from 1738–1748, architect Johann Christoph Glaubitz completely reconstructed the church in style of late Baroque. During the 1827-28 reconstruction, architect Karol Podczaszynski destroyed the bulk of the sumptuous Baroque interior - nearly 3000 carts with splinters of altars, sculptures and stucco works were taken to a dump; chapels suffered the least. In the Soviet times the church was closed down and severely damaged. During Hitler's occupation, the Reverend Alfonsas Lipniūnas, who was later imprisoned by the Nazis in the Stutthof camp and perished, delivered rebellious sermons in the church. In 1979 a university museum was founded there. In 1991 the church was returned to its parishioners. On his visit to Lithuania in 1993, Pope John Paul II held a meeting with intellectuals here.Prof. Tomas Venclova. VILNIUS; R. Paknys Publishing House, The church is dedicated to both St John the Baptist and St John the Evangelist. Architecture The layout of the Church of St. Johns still reflects its original Gothic structure. It is a hall church with three naves and seven asymmetrical chapels. The tower, consisting of 5 gradually decreasing portions, is the tallest building of Vilnius Old Town (). The central focus of the church interior is a composition of 10 presbytery altars, unique in Lithuania and the Baltic countries (before Pdczaszynski's demolition work there were as many as 22 altars in the presbytery and naves). The altars are positioned in a semi-circle, on varying planes and levels, and light illuminates them through the Gothic presbytery windows. They are abundantly decorated with paintings and sculptures. The organ of the Church of St. Johns was the most famous one in Lithuania, but in the Soviet period it was destroyed; it has now been restored. In the central nave at the pillars stand 18 sculptures, 12 of which represent various saints bearing the name of John. All frescoes in the church date from the 18th century and were uncovered and restored in the 1970's. The church contains many memorial monuments: to Konstantinas Sirvydas (sculpt. Juozas Kėdainis, 1979), Adam Mickiewicz (sculpt. Piotr Stryjenski and Marceli Gujski, 1899), Simonas Daukantas (sculpt. Gediminas Jokūbonis, 1979) and others.

Interventions and Provocations: Conversations on Art, Culture, and Resistance. SUNY Press, 1998. His pieces are held in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art, among others. He is part of a generation of artists—such as Coco Fusco, Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Pepón Osorio and Papo Colo—who in the 1980s and '90s explored questions of ethnic, racial and national identity in their work, be it through painting, video, performance or installation. Sánchez specifically became known for producing brightly hued mixed media canvases that addressed issues of Puerto Rican life in the U.S. and on the island. Of his work, critic Lucy Lippard once wrote: \\"it teaches us new ways of seeing what surrounds us.\\" Sanchez combines painting and photography with other media clippings and found objects to confront America's political policies and social practices concerning his parents' homeland of Puerto Rico. Sanchez often specifically addresses Puerto Rico's battle for independence and the numerous obstacles facing disadvantaged Puerto Ricans in America. Sánchez is a professor of painting, photography and combined media at Hunter College in New York City.

The tower was named after Colonel Griffith Lewis, who commanded the Royal Engineers in Jersey from December 1830 to January 1836.  History  The location was of some military significance. On 1 May 1779, the Rector of St Ouen, le Sire du Parcq, brought the parish field guns to a favourable spot to help repulse the Franco-Dutch Invasion of Jersey. In 1787 the British placed a battery of three 24-pounder guns on the spot. In 1835, the Martello tower was built there. Lewis Tower has an elliptical footprint, with the tower's wall being thicker on the seaward side. It has three levels with a central pillar and a circular spiral staircase between the floors. It is 33 feet in height and has a diameter of 39 feet. It was armed with a single 24-pounder gun. It is thus smaller and more lightly armed than the nearby Kempt Tower. Four years after Lewis Tower's completion, it received a coat of stucco or cement to reduce the damp. During the German occupation of the Channel Islands, the Germans built a large bunker next to Lewis Tower. The bunker today houses the Channel Islands Military Museum. The Germans also built a concrete extension at the tower's base that housed a searchlight. Today, the tower is available as self-catering accommodation under a programme that Jersey Heritage administers for the States of Jersey Towers and Forts project.

It was completed around 1825 to serve as the Romney branch office of the Bank of the Valley of Virginia, and served as a location for every subsequent bank established in Romney, including the Bank of Romney and the First National Bank of Romney. During the American Civil War, the building was used as a military prison. For a time, its second floor housed the offices and printing plant of the Hampshire Review newspaper, and by 1947 its ground floor housed office and mercantile space, and the second floor was divided into apartments. In 1964 the Wirgman Building sustained damage in a fire; it was demolished the following year to make way for the new Bank of Romney headquarters building, which opened in 1966. Prior to its demolition, in 1937, the Wirgman Building was photographed and documented by the National Park Service's Historic American Buildings Survey.  History  =Background= In 1790, the trustees of the Town of Romney commissioned John Mitchel to draft a cadastral survey map of Romney. Prior to this survey, Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron had commissioned a similar cadastral survey of the town sometime before its incorporation on December 23, 1762. On June 30, 1790, Mitchel submitted to the trustees a \\"Plan of the Town of Romney\\" that divided the town into 100 land lots of equal size, with four lots adjacent to the courthouse comprising the \\"publick\\" square. The Wirgman Building was later built upon the \\"publick\\" land lot numbered \\"Lot 76\\". Romney's first cemetery was present on the lot when it was a part of the courthouse square. The cemetery's interments were located on the actual site and to the rear of the future Wirgman Building. = Bank of the Valley of Virginia = The Wirgman Building was erected around 1825 by William Vance to house the office of the newly established Romney branch of the Bank of the Valley of Virginia, which was headquartered in Winchester, Virginia. In an act of the Virginia General Assembly on February 5, 1817, the Bank of the Valley of Virginia was authorized to open branches in Berkeley, Hampshire, Hardy, and Jefferson counties if citizens in each of these areas could raise $100,000 in stock to establish a branch. This provision was met when the necessary stock was raised, and the Bank of the Valley of Virginia branch in Romney was opened around 1825 in the Wirgman Building. In 1845, historian Henry Howe traveled through Romney and described the town as \\"one of considerable business, and has a branch of the Bank of the Valley, several stores, and about 350 inhabitants\\". The bank branch continued to operate from the Wirgman Building until the Bank of the Valley of Virginia in Winchester suspended its operations and those of its branches following the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861. = American Civil War = During the American Civil War, the Wirgman Building was frequently used as a military prison by both Confederate States Army and Union Army forces during their occupations of Romney. In early 1862, Lieutenant John Blue, a spy for the command of Stonewall Jackson, was captured by Union Army soldiers while he was conducting a reconnaissance mission to determine the size and strength of the Union Army forces occupying Romney. Pending his transfer to a military prison in Wheeling where he was to be tried as a suspected spy, Blue was imprisoned in a room on the second floor of the Wirgman Building. During the early morning of April 20—Easter Day—Blue disabled the only guard on duty, disguised himself in a Union Army coat and headgear and barricaded the remainder of the prison garrison within the building. Blue, unnoticed by the occupying Union Army forces, walked to the periphery of Romney town and reached safety. = Hampshire Review = The Hampshire Review newspaper occupied the building's second floor with its offices and printing plant from 1884 to 1895. In 1890 John J. Cornwell—who later became West Virginia's governor—and his brother William B. Cornwell purchased the newspaper, which continued to operate from the second floor of the Wirgman Building until 1895, when the brothers relocated the office and printing plant to the first floor of their new brick building on West Main Street. During its occupation of the Wirgman Building, the Hampshire Review was printed with a hand-operated Benjamin Franklin printing press. = Bank of Romney = Banking operations in Hampshire County ceased throughout the American Civil War; a new banking institution was not established in Romney until 1888. By September of that year, a coordinated effort by Romney's leading citizens amassed subscriptions for the entirety of the initial offering of 300 shares of stock for the establishment of the Bank of Romney. The shareholders of the Bank of Romney petitioned the Secretary of State of West Virginia for a charter with capital stock totaling $30,000. Following the state's approval of its charter, the Bank of Romney commenced its operations in the Wirgman Building on December 20, 1888. The bank occupied two rented rooms on the building's first floor, which it shared with a pharmacy. The Bank of Romney initially used a safe as its bank vault, and security for the bank was provided by a nightwatchman who slept in one of the bank's two rooms. The Wirgman Building's security was further enhanced with the installation of wire mesh glass and bars in the windows. During the bank's occupation at the Wirgman Building, Henry Bell Gilkeson served as the bank's president. The Bank of Romney began to outgrow its first floor space almost immediately after its incorporation, and in 1906 it moved across East Main Street to a new bank building. = First National Bank of Romney = The Wirgman Building again housed a banking institution four years later when the First National Bank of Romney opened on June 11, 1910, in the first floor office space previously occupied by the Bank of Romney. The First National Bank of Romney vacated the Wirgman Building in 1911, when it moved to its new, three-story building known as the National Building at the corner of West Main and South High Streets directly across from Literary Hall. At various times from its construction around 1825 until 1911, the Wirgman Building served as the location for every bank established in Romney since the Bank of the Valley of Virginia. = Later years = Two historical markers in front of the Bank of Romney memorialize the Wirgman Building: the first marker (pictured left) was erected by the United Daughters of the Confederacy to commemorate Lieutenant John Blue's escape from the building during the American Civil War, and the second marker (pictured right) reads \\"Original Site of the Wirgman Building. Built 1825. Razed 1965.\\" In its final years, the Wirgman Building housed office and mercantile spaces on its first floor, and its second floor was divided into apartments. In 1937, the National Park Service Historic American Buildings Survey (HABS) photographed and documented the architectural details of the building. At the time of its documentation by HABS, the building was owned by Mrs. W. F. Wirgman, whose family's surname likely gave the structure its local toponym. HABS referred to the Wirgman Building as the \\"Valley Bank Building\\" in its supplemental documentation, which was completed by Archie A. Biggs. In September 1937, the West Virginia State Road Commission released a state road map highlighting the history of the Potomac Highlands through photographs; the map included a feature on the Wirgman Building and Lieutenant John Blue's escape during its use as a military prison during the American Civil War. By 1954, the Wirgman Building housed an electrical shop and two residential units. Throughout the 1950s, the Romney community used the building for multiple purposes. The Romney Fire Department used the building to host its annual Easter flower sale in March 1956, and in December 1956, the Hampshire County Democratic Committee was permitted to erect a sign on the building. In 1962, the Wirgman Building was one of the Romney landmarks recognized during the city's observance of its bicentennial.  Fire and demolition  On February 15, 1964, the Wirgman Building sustained significant damage from a fire. At the time of the fire, the first floor of the building housed the Peaford Company furniture store. Mrs. John Williams, operator of the nearby New Century Hotel, was the first person to observe the fire; she raised the alarm around 6:25 a.m. The Romney Fire Department responded and fought the blaze for over eight hours, with the assistance of fire companies from Augusta, Slanesville, and Fort Ashby. When firefighters left the scene around 3:30 p.m., only the brick walls of the building remained standing. Firefighters approximated that of water had been used to fight the fire. Though assessed to have been extinguished, the fire re-established the following day. According to Romney Fire Department Chief Eugene Dorsey, the Wirgman Building was uninsured and its damage was estimated at $5,000. Dorsey estimated damages to the partially-insured Peaford Company furniture store at $6,000. Following the fire, the Bank of Romney purchased the Wirgman Building and demolished it, along with the neighboring historic Brady House, in 1965 to make way for the bank's new headquarters building. Having outgrown its 1906 building, the Bank of Romney returned across East Main Street to the site of the Wirgman Building following completion of its new, larger headquarters facility in 1966.  Architecture  Existing information on the architectural details of the Wirgman Building are known through the HABS supplementary documentation written by Archie A. Biggs in 1937, and a Cumberland Evening Times article in 1954. The Cumberland Evening Times averred that the building had not undergone major structural changes since the American Civil War. = Exterior = The Wirgman Building was exemplary of the Federal style of architecture. It was a thick-walled edifice rising two stories and constructed of brick. The building's brickwork was built in the Flemish bond style on the building's façade and in the American bond style on the building's sides and rear face. The building's façade along East Main Street measured , and its sides measured , with a rear extension measuring . The building featured a brick cornice along its roofline and parapet end walls on its sides. According to HABS documentation, the building's bricks measured 2 ¼ x 4 ¼ x 8 ½ in size. = Interior = A circular wall with a six-panel wooden door rounded to mimic the wall's curvature was located between the entrance hall and the stair hall of the Wirgman Building. The stairway's balustrade in the stair hall featured turned baluster shafts and a newel post crafted from maple. The stairs themselves featured scrolled step ends. The building's interior doors were six-panel wooden doors with paneled door jambs. Instead of turning door knobs, these wooden doors were equipped with \\"iron lever-like\\" devices that unlatched the doors when pushed down. HABS supplementary documentation described \\"coffee grinder\\"-style locks. Its doorways were reported to have maintained their original decorative molding trim, and the fireplace mantelpieces as being \\"delicately done\\". The Wirgman Building also featured old wooden floors, which the Cumberland Evening Times said emitted \\"aged groans\\" when walked upon.  Legacy  In his Buildings of West Virginia (2004), architectural historian S. Allen Chambers wrote that of the \\"most significant early buildings\\" demolished in Romney, the Wirgman Building is one of the town's \\"major losses\\". Prior to its destruction, a 1954 article in the Cumberland Evening Times characterized the building as an \\"aged monument to the Civil War and horse and buggy days, as motorized traffic on U.S. 50 whizzes by its door\\". In 1982, the Cumberland Evening Times listed the Wirgman Building among a list of Romney's significant demolished landmarks, along with the original Romney First Baptist Church, the Brady House, the New Century Hotel, and the original Romney Christian Church. Two commemorative plaques in front of the Bank of Romney are the only reminders of the Wirgman Building at its original site. A plaque erected by the Stonewall Jackson Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy to commemorate the escape of Lieutenant John Blue from the Wirgman Building during its use as a Union Army military prison was originally affixed to the building's street façade. The other plaque says: \\"Original Site of the Wirgman Building. Built 1825.

County 254 counties of Texas Texas has a total of 254 counties, by far the largest number of counties of any state. Each county is run by a five- member Commissioners' Court consisting of four commissioners elected from single-member districts (called commissioner precincts) and a county judge elected at-large. The county judge does not have authority to veto a decision of the commissioners court; the judge votes along with the commissioners (being the tie-breaker in close calls). In smaller counties, the county judge actually does perform judicial duties, but in larger counties the judge's role is limited to serving on the commissioners court and certifying elections. Certain officials, such as the sheriff and tax collector, are elected separately by the voters, but the commissioners court determines their office budgets, and sets overall county policy. All county elections are partisan, and commissioner precincts are redistricted after each ten year Census both to equalize the voting power in each and in consideration of the political party preferences of the voters in each. Counties in Texas have limited regulatory (ordinance) authority. Counties also have much less legal power than home rule municipalities. They can only pass ordinances (local laws with penalties for violations) in cases where the Texas statutes have given them express permission to. Counties in Texas do not have zoning power (except for limited instances around some reservoirs, military establishments, historic sites and airports, and in large counties over \\"communication facility structures\\": visible antennas). However, counties can collect a small portion of property tax and spend it to provide residents with needed services or to employ the power of eminent domain. Counties also have the power to regulate outdoor lighting near observatories and military bases. Counties do not have \\"home rule\\" authority; whatever powers they enjoy are specifically granted by the State. Harris County Administration Building Unlike other states, Texas does not allow for consolidated city-county governments. Cities and counties (as well as other political entities) are permitted to enter \\"interlocal agreements\\" to share services (for instance, a city and a school district may enter into agreements with the county whereby the county bills for and collects property taxes for the city and school district; thus, only one tax bill is sent instead of three). Texas does allow municipalities to merge, but populous Harris County, Texas consolidating with its primary city, Houston, Texas, to form the nation's second largest city (after New York City) is not a prospect under current law. As one textbook produced for use in Texas schools has openly acknowledged, Texas counties are prone to inefficient operations and are vulnerable to corruption, for several reasons.Charldean Newell, David Forrest Prindle, and James W. Riddlesperger, Jr., Texas Politics, 11th ed. (Boston: Cengage Learning, 2011), 376-381. First, most of them do not have a merit system but operate on a spoils system, so that many county employees obtain their positions through loyalty to a particular political party and commissioner rather than whether they actually have the skills and experience appropriate to their positions. Second, most counties have not centralized purchasing into a single procurement department which would be able to seek quantity discounts and carefully scrutinize bids and contract awards for unusual patterns. Third, in 90 percent of Texas counties, each commissioner is individually responsible for planning and executing their own road construction and maintenance program for their own precinct, which results in poor coordination and duplicate construction machinery. Municipal Texas does not have townships; areas within a county are either incorporated or unincorporated. Incorporated areas are part of a city, though the city may contract with the county for needed services. Unincorporated areas are not part of a city; in these areas the county has authority for law enforcement and road maintenance. Their local ordinances, rules, and police regulations are usually codified in a \\"code of ordinances\\". Dallas City Hall CitiesAlthough a municipality may refer to itself as a \\"town\\" or \\"village\\", legally it is classified as a city and subject to the applicable laws of either a general law or home rule city. are classified as either \\"general law\\" or \\"home rule\\". A city may elect home rule status (i.e., draft an independent city charter) once it exceeds 5,000 population and the voters agree to home rule; however, the charter cannot conflict with either the state Constitution or the general laws of the state. Otherwise, the municipality is classified as general law and has only those very limited powers specified in the general laws. One example of the difference in the two structures regards annexation. General law cities cannot annex adjacent unincorporated areas without the property owners' consent; home rule cities may annex without consent but must provide essential services within a specified period of time (generally within three years) or the property owner may file suit to be disannexed and reimbursed. Once a city adopts home rule it may continue to keep this status even if the population later falls below 5,000. Larger cities (those exceeding 225,000) have a unique authority: that of \\"limited annexation\\", whereby an adjoining area may be annexed for purposes of imposing city ordinances related to safety and building codes. The residents can vote for mayor and council races but cannot vote in bond elections (and, consequently, the city cannot directly collect city sales tax from businesses or city property tax from owners). However, the City of Houston has exploited a glitch in the state law that allows it to share in sales tax revenues along with special districts (municipal utility districts, for instance) that cross an area \\"annexed for limited purposes.\\" This has led to a spiderwebbing known as limited purpose or special purpose annexations that consist of mostly commercial properties facing major streets. These extend through otherwise unincorporated areas. It has also led to conflicts between city and county officials over the provision of services to these areas not included in the agreements. The purpose of limited annexation is to allow the city to control development in an area that it eventually will fully annex; it is meant to do so within three years (though it can arrange \\"non-annexation agreements\\" with local property owners), and those agreements with municipal utility districts also cloud the picture. During each of the three years, the city is to develop land use planning for the area (zoning, for example), identify needed capital improvements and ongoing projects, and identify the financing for such as well as to provide essential municipal services. Houston City Hall Municipal elections in Texas are nonpartisan in the sense that candidates do not appear on the ballot on party lines, and do not run as party tickets. However, a candidate's party affiliation is usually known or can be discerned with minimal effort (as the candidate most likely has supported other candidates on partisan tickets). In some instances, an informal citizen's group will support a slate of candidates that it desires to see elected (often in opposition to an incumbent group with which it disagreed on an issue). However, each candidate must be voted on individually. Special districts In addition to cities and counties, Texas has numerous special districts. The most common is the independent school district. Special districts include Groundwater Conservation Districts (regulatory agencies), river authorities, port authorities, water supply districts (for irrigation or municipal supply), public hospitals, road districts and community college districts. =School districts= Independent school districts have a board of trustees that is independent of any other governing authority, with the exception of the Stafford Municipal School District. School district boundaries are not generally aligned with city or county boundaries; it is common for a school district to cover one or more counties or for a large city to be served by several school districts. As with municipal elections in Texas, board members or trustees are elected on a nonpartisan basis or may be appointed. The Texas Education Agency governs public education in Texas.

It was located fourteen miles east of Perryville, ninety miles south of Saint Louis, and lay directly on the Mississippi River.Roadside Thoughts: Seventy-Six  Etymology  A number of theories abound to where the name Seventy-Six originates from. One theory tells of an 1844 flood where a steamboat captain who had been sent to the site to rescue the people reported that he had made 76 landings. Another theory concerns a steamboat captain who had quit swearing and had acquired the habit of exclaiming \\"That beats all 76,\\" when he was vexed. He used the expression so often at that landing that the steamboat men had got into the habit of calling it Seventy-Six. Another possible explanation is that the landing is the 76th landing after leaving St. Louis. Yet another theory exists that the Government River Commission numbered the river landings and this was No. 76 from the head of the navigable waters.Southeast Missourian: Seventy-Six, Missouri: Even number, odd name http://www.semissourian.com/blogs/pavementends/entry/33475/ Another story explaining the origin of the name has it that the first captain to land his boat at the site was celebrating his 76th birthday. According to steamboat captain John Wilkinson, who was to later found the town, the name of the community came from an unfortunate accident when he struck a snag and sank his vessel just outside the nearby landing in 1886, and since it happened to be the seventy-sixth landing on the voyage, the town was named for the catastrophe. Legend has it that Mr. Wilkinson printed a board on the opposite bank \\"76 LDG\\" from which the town took its name.Wichern.org Seventy-Six Missouri http://www.wichern.org/towns/76.htm  History  The small community of Seventy-Six originated as a river landing for steamboats on the Mississippi River. John Wilkinson, an immigrant from Yorkshire, England, came to the US around 1816 when his parents immigrated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He and his father invested in a riverboat called The Laurel and became involved in the shipping trade. The first trip from Louisville, Kentucky to Alton, Illinois went well. However, the return trip met with disaster when the ship sank a few miles from what would later be known as Seventy-Six, Missouri. Wading ashore after the accident, his only possession being the clothes he wore, he was said to have exclaimed: \\"Here is where I lost it and here is where I'll get it back.\\" A shanty was constructed from the wreckage of the Laurel and Wilkinson immediately became a dealer in cord wood, which was the only fuel used at that time to power river steamboats. His business started off by simply hauling wood using a hand sled in the winter and a wheelbarrow in the summer. Over time he used small boats to take wood by water, eventually acquiring oxen and wagon to move the wood. Eventually, Wilkinson became one of the largest landowners in the area. An island in the Mississippi - Wilkinson Island - was named after him; however, this island lies on the right side of the Mississippi River on the \\"Illinois\\" side. The main economic activity in Seventy-Six was the riverboat landing and the sale of cord wood. The community was also home to two schools. \\"Union School\\" was attended by white children, while black children attended a separate school. The community also featured a general store \\"The G.S. Hatch Store\\", the Hatch Grain Company, fruit orchards, a stockyard, a saloon, a hotel, a post office (1880-1957), and a train depot. Eventually ownership of most of the land on which the community sat had passed to G.S. Hatch, who not only ran the general store, but also operated the boat landing, a large timber operation, owned an 800-acre tract of land including the fruit orchard, and had practically the whole population of Seventy-Six in his employ.Southeast Missourian Newspaper, May 17, 2002 https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1893&dat;=20020517&id;=1XxFAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=PMcMAAAAIBAJ&pg;=4929,2521700 Seventy-Six was also home to Shiloh Evangelical-Lutheran Church which had been organized in 1857 by Jonathan Crimminger and was affiliated with the Evangelical-Lutheran Synod of Southern Illinois. Presbyterian church services were held on the second floor of the G.S. Hatch General Store and were conducted by Reverend James Valentine Worsham, who rode by horse from Old Appleton. Baptisms were held in a creek about a mile outside of Seventy-Six. In 1903, the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway built a railroad along the river which made river traffic less lucrative. Trains stopped twice a day - 11:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. every day. The rail service also attracted the attention of Jack \\"Quail Hunter\\" Kennedy - the last of the Jesse James gang. In October, 1922, Jack Kennedy and his accomplices robbed the St. Louis-San Francisco train just outside Seventy-Six. The target of the train robbery were packages of money earmarked for a bank in Memphis, Tennessee. However, one of Kennedy's accomplices was an undercover Federal Marshall. The conductor, engineer and firemen on the train were aware of the planned robbery. Kennedy and one of his accomplices were shot dead during the attempted getaway. Following numerous floods and a sharp decline in river transport, the community eventually disappeared. By 1940 the community had a population of only 35 people. In 1957 the post office closed. In the late 1950s what was left of the community depopulated. Today, forest and farmland cover the spot where Seventy-Six once stood.  Conservation department  In 1990, the Missouri Department of Conservation incorporated the area into the Seventy-Six Conservation Area, which is used as a demonstration area for forest and wildlife management techniques. The conservation area also includes the Wilkinson Walking Trail.The Missouri Department of Conservation: Seventy-Six Conservation Area  Geography  Seventy-Six was located along the Mississippi River at the end of Missouri Route D due west of \\"Mile 90\\". Although the Mississippi River forms the border between most of Missouri and Illinois, this particular section of the Mississippi is actually surrounded by Missouri on both sides. Wilkinson Island, which is shared by both Missouri and Illinois, lies on the east side of the Mississippi River.Altenburg, MO, 7.5 Minute Topographic Quadrangle, USGS, 1947, (1990 rev.)

It's revealed that Charles was the one who hit Jane in the head and now he is taking her back to Chance Harbor unconscious. He also has the crystal Jane had to save Henry. When he gets back home, he and Dawn are trying to find a spell that will interact with Jane's memory so she won't remember what happened at Henry's.

While Adam and Jake try to pull Faye out of the water, Cassie sees again the little girl at the edge of the deck. She gets there and with magic she manages to emerge Henry's body from the water. Dawn gets there to take Faye and everyone is going back to Chance Harbor. On their way back, Jake reveals to Cassie that it was Henry's energy who led them to his body using Faye's memories and that Cassie getting into her memories is not something that everyone can do. He is telling her that she is more powerful than she thinks. Jake also informs Isaac (JR Bourne), who's waiting for him back home, about Cassie's power and that they have to wait to find the right way to kill her because of that power. The episode ends with Cassie talking to her grandmother about Henry and Jane saying that she never manage to get into the house since Henry was not there. The only problem is that Cassie found Jane's scarf inside the house. They both find that strange but Jane doesn't remember what happened.

From 1891 to 1901, he represented Fauquier County in the House of Delegates. Early life and military service Pilcher was born in Warrenton, Virginia on March 20, 1844. He was the fourth and youngest child of Alexander Spottswood Pilcher, a farmer and Frances Pitt Pilcher (née Shumate). On February 5, 1863, at the age of eighteen, Pilcher enlisted in the Confederate States Army, wishing to fight in the ongoing American Civil War. He served as a private with Company H of the 4th Virginia Cavalry Regiment, also known as the \\"Black Horse Cavalry,\\" until the end of the war two years later. Career Delegate Pilcher, 1891 Pilcher first held political office in 1891 when he was elected as a Democrat to represent Fauquier County in the Virginia House of Delegates. After this, he represented his home county for four subsequent two-year terms. He succeeded his older brother, Julius, who served two terms in that position. In 1901, Pilcher retired to his farm, spending the next fourteen years mostly staying out of politics. In 1915, Pilcher reentered public life, making a run for the 11th district seat in the Virginia state senate. He was successful, representing the district, which was then composed of Fauquier and Loudoun, during the General Assembly's 1916 session. Pilcher died in his hometown on December 7, 1917. His replacement in the Senate, Lucien Keith was sworn in on the first day of the General Assembly's next session, January 10, 1918, and the body was later that day adjourned in his memory. Personal life Pilcher married Ada George on December 5, 1867. The couple had two sons, John and George. George's eldest son (also named Theodore Clay) represented Norfolk City in the House of Delegates from 1954 to 1965. Pilcher is buried in Midland Cemetery in Fauquier.

Farley, President of the NJ Senate Meyer I. \\"Mike\\" Segal (September 26, 1922 – June 8, 1982) was the New Jersey politician and businessman who was one of the leaders for the initiative to legalize gambling in Atlantic City. At that time, the only legal gambling on the mainland of the United States was in Nevada. Leading the gambling initiative By the 1960s Atlantic City, the once chic vacation destination of both the wealthy and the masses, had fallen into disrepair and partial obscurity. The city had been hugely successful from the late 1800s through World War II, as visitors could travel via train to the stately hotels and the beaches, and escape the heat of the cities; the boardwalk, beaches, Steel Pier's diving horse and Miss America Pageant were world famous.Davis, Ed (1980).

In late 1968, Mike Segal and a group of influential local businessmen announced they would pursue the possibility of legalizing gambling in the cityAtlantic City Press, 12/7/68 – Legal Gambling Sought for City as a cure for the ailing economy. The initiative received press coverage locally and nationally, as it was the first serious attempt to challenge Nevada's monopoly on gambling.Philadelphia Bulletin, 12/8/68 - Shore Group to Push for Legal Gambling Shortly after announcing, Segal, hoteliers Gary Malamut and Sonny Goldberg, restaurateur Arnold Orsatti, and others, formed the \\"Action Committee for Legalized Gaming\\"; Segal was elected Chairman of the Committee. In the week following the official announcement of the Committee, they received over 2,000 unsolicited phone calls and letters.Atlantic City Press, 12/14/68 - City Betting Campaign is Snowballing Leading citizens, like international art dealer and \\"Merchant to the Rich\\" Reese Palley, publicly supported the initiative.Atlantic City Press, 12/28/68 - \\"Voice of the People\\" – Reese Palley Numerous articles appeared in local and metropolitan papers.Meyer I. (Mike) Segal Archive of Articles1973 - Segal (L), \\"Mr. Atlantic City\\" Skinny D'Amato (C), U.S. Congressman Charles W. Sandman (R). To garner additional support, Segal openly supported the State Lottery proposal of Democratic Governor Richard J. Hughes,Atlantic City Press, 1/20/69 - Segal Backs Hughes on N.J. Lottery who was not a supporter of legalizing gambling in Atlantic City exclusively. Segal also supported the Camden, New Jersey initiative for legalized gambling, which Camden locals saw as a cure to the financial woes of their declining city.Atlantic City Press, 1/69 – ‘ACTION’ Backs Camden Plan There was overwhelming local support and powerful political allies. Years later Segal admitted that none of them anticipated the massive resistance that would be mounted by churches and religious groups across the stateAtlantic City Press, 6/8/77 – The Toughest Opponent of All and that would turn the initiative into an 8-year battle. For the first four years, Segal and his colleagues worked through the Action Committee, and for the last four years they worked behind the scenes. In 1976, Mayor Joseph Lazarow became chairmen of the new casino-gambling organization \\"The Committee to Rebuild Atlantic City.\\" Ultimately, a statewide general referendum in 1976 won approval for gambling in Atlantic City, after the earlier 1974 referendum failed.New Jersey Casino Control Commission History The first casino opened in Atlantic City in 1978, and over the next decade tourism in Atlantic City burgeoned to record-breaking proportions. At its peak, in the decade immediately following the opening of gambling casinos, Atlantic City hosted >35 million tourists a year, surpassing both Disney World and Las Vegas as the #1 tourist destination in the country. By 2009, Atlantic City had fallen out of the \\"Top 10\\" tourist destinations in the US,Forbes - America’s Most Visited Cities – 2009 and by 2011, the number of annual visitors had declined to 28.5 million. Political career Segal entered politics in the 1960s on the Republican ticket as a Councilman in Ventnor City, New Jersey.Atlantic City Press, 5/23/63 – Segal Is Sworn As CouncilmanRepublican campaign card, 11/5/65 (One of Segal's many terms in office.) He served as a Councilman, as President of CouncilAtlantic City Press, 1/1/66 – Segal to be President of Council and as a Commissioner before devoting his political efforts exclusively to the Action Committee to Legalize Gaming. At the outset of his political career, he gained the confidence of powerful State Senator, Frank S. Farley, also a Ventnor resident. From the early 1940s when he succeeded Enoch \\"Nucky\\" Johnson, until the early 1970s, Farley was the undisputed leader of the Republican political machine based in Atlantic City and known as \\"The Boardwalk Empire\\" during Johnson's reign.Johnson, Nelson (2002). BOARDWALK EMPIRE. Medford Press, Medford, NJ. . It should be noted this is the factual historical text written by Johnson, not the fictionalized account that was later based on the text and produced as a television series. Farley was the most powerful of the State Senators, serving 34 years in the legislature, and holding the position of President of the Senate, a position that afforded him the power to direct the legislative process in the state. Farley initially refused to support the attempt to legalize gambling, as he feared his involvement would bring increased scrutiny on his powerful political machine. By 1970 Segal convinced Farley, and from that time forward the Senator (and eventually ex-Senator) worked behind the scenes to gain approval. Segal also gained the support of U.S Congressman Charles W. Sandman. Marine Corps Segal joined the Marine Corps in the late 1930s. He was sent to Honolulu, Hawaii, and was present on December 7, 1941 when the base was attacked by Japanese forces. Segal served in the Second Marine Division, decorated for their outstanding courage in the Pacific Theater of Operations, notably the battles of Guadalcanal, Saipan and Tarawa.Johnston, Richard W.

He remained active as an officer in both the Second Marine Division Association, and the Marine Corps League, until his death.

When he was 10 he was sent to be educated by Andreas Cupicius, a preacher with Protestant leanings, at Weissenkirchen, and served his teacher when he was imprisoned during the persecutions of that time. The two escaped to Hungary, from where Pantaleon returned to continue his education with Vitus Nuber, abbot of Seisenstein, whom he followed when his patron fled to Germany. There he came under the protection of Wolfgang, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken, from whom he received a scholarship to Wittenberg University, where he studied for seven years from 1558. It was during this time that he Latinised his name to Candidus under the influence of Philip Melanchthon. Having served as secretary to the Humanist Hubert Languet, and also as a schoolmaster, he eventually ordained as a minister and, having served for a while outside the city, became church superintendent in Zweibrücken in 1571. Formerly the church there had been Lutheran, but following the death of Duke Wolfgang it turned to moderate Calvinism, with the support of Pantaleon.

History =Box Set (1991-2006)= Jeff Pehrson, currently a backup vocalist for Furthur, began playing guitar and writing original songs in 1985 while matriculating at San Francisco State University. In 1987, along with keyboardist/vocalist friend Matt Twain, the Twain & Pehrson Duo began playing regular gigs at San Francisco's The Owl and the Monkey Cafe. In 1991, singer-songwriter Jim Brunberg joined the duo, forming the folk rock band, Box Set, that began performing locally, and after establishing a growing loyal fan base, regionally. Twain, who was unable to travel due to his day job, left the band, leaving the Box Set Duo, which still continues to perform on occasion in the Bay Area and Portland. The increasingly popular duo, whose expressive songwriting and resonant harmonies have prompted comparisons to Simon & Garfunkel, decided to broaden their sound by adding drummer Matt Abbott and bass player Chad Heise in 1993 and keyboardist/harmonicist/accordionist Sam Johnston in 1994. Box Set toured continuously until 2004, when their touring pace slowed, in part due to Brunberg's relocating to Portland and matriculating in law school, and performed its last show in 2006. During its career, Box Set released a total of 12 recordings, was recognized by Billboard on their \\"Honor Roll of Unsigned Talent\\" in 1994, was named \\"Group of the Year\\" by the National Academy of Songwriters in 1995, and won two Bay Area Music Awards (\\"Bammies\\") for \\"Best Club Band\\" and \\"Outstanding Americana/Roots Band\\" in 1997. =The Fall Risk (2009-present)= While working in a merger and acquisitions firm in San Francisco, Pehrson became inspired to start another band.

Following the band's debut, Berljafa left to pursue playing blues in San Jose, and was replaced by Dave Moffat. In early 2010, while developing his band, Pehrson became one of two backup vocalists for Furthur, a jam band formed in 2009 by former Grateful Dead members, Bob Weir and Phil Lesh, with whom he still performs. Shortly thereafter in 2010, The Fall Risk added former Box Set member Sam Johnston (organ, accordion, pedal steel) and Rich Goldstein (rhythm/lead/slide guitar) (who performs with drummer Mark Abbott in his band Little Muddy) and added \\"Fiddle\\" Dave Muhlethaler (fiddle, mandolin) and Phil Savell (lead guitar) in 2011; Eddie Berljafa returned to the band, replacing Dave Moffat at that time, as well. Muhlethaler left the band in 2012, followed by Ballard and Berljafa in 2013, at which time Mike Sugar (bass) began. Although the band has performed primarily in the Bay Area, they embarked on a Mid-Atlantic mini-tour in early August, 2013, coinciding with the release of their debut CD. Musical style The Fall Risk performs original songs written by Jeff Pehrson, both during his time with Box Set and with The Fall Risk, as well as occasional covers of bands such as Grateful Dead, The Beatles, The Who, Traffic, Jimi Hendrix and Van Morrison. Their songs, which embody a combination of evocative, poetic lyrics and infectious, uplifting melodies, are performed in an Americana/roots/folk rock style.

After initial building works Washington failed to expand as had been expected. In his history of the village Christopher H. Dingwall attributed this to the decline of the rural textile industry and the rapid expansion of railways meaning that Washington quickly lost its advantage of being one of the few settlements in the area connected to a railway. Railway rebuilding as part of the construction of the Scottish Midland Junction Railway led to the removal of the station at Washington village and its replacement with a station called Ardler slightly further away from the village. Following the establishment of a church and the foundation of the Parish of Ardler in 1885, the name Ardler superseded that of Washington. The church at Ardler was erected in memory of James Drummond Carmichael (1849-1881) by his father Peter Carmichael, a Dundee textile mill manager and senior partner in Baxter Brothers & Co Ltd. Peter Carmichael family had purchased the nearby Arthurstone estate in 1869 and expanded it to include other nearby farms including East and West Ardler.

Plot The show begins with five New Yorkers sharing their dating disasters (\\"The One\\"). The scene shifts to an unnamed restaurant in modern-day New York City. Aaron, a quirky man, enters the restaurant and begins to talk with the waiter. Based on how nervous he is, the waiter guesses that this is a first date. After the waiter seats Aaron, an artsy woman named Casey enters the restaurant. She spies Aaron putting in eye drops as he waits for her, making her dread the date even more; she then orders strong drinks in hopes that the date will be quick and painless. Casey and Aaron exchange some small talk and it is revealed that the date was set up by Casey's sister, Lauren, whose husband Kevin is a co-worker of Aaron's. Through the small talk, they both develop first impressions of each other (\\"First Impressions\\"). Casey's friend Reggie calls her during the date, offering for Casey to use his call as a way out of the date (\\"Bailout #1\\"), but Casey thinks enough of Aaron to ignore the call. Aaron and Casey begin to bond over friends from summer camp and high school after discovering their hometowns are near each other. Aaron casually makes a joke about Jewish geography, to which Casey responds she's not Jewish. This leads Aaron to a dream sequence where he imagines his dead Grandma Ida, who scolds Aaron for not dating a nice Jewish girl instead. Casey's extremely Christian father then shows up in Aaron's dream sequence, and tells Aaron that he is not happy with the idea of Aaron becoming his son in law. Next, Aaron imagines the son he could potentially have with Casey confronting him about which religion to choose and how he wishes he wasn't born (\\"The Girl For You\\"). Aaron nervously asks her questions about religion hoping that she does have some Jewish in her before discovering she is an atheist. Relieved, he makes a joke about Casey's views on spirituality (she believes in the power of meditation), but it backfires when he accidentally insults her. This results in a long awkward pause (\\"The Awkward Pause\\"). Casey is then visited in her mind by her sister Lauren, who urges Casey not to screw this date up, because \\"Casey's biological clock is ticking,\\" especially if she continues her current dating pattern of going the distance with bad boys on the first date and ruining any potential with nice guys like Aaron. Meanwhile, Aaron is visited by his best friend Gabe, who convinces him that the date is going well. However, Aaron then imagines his ex-girlfriend Allison, who tells him that she still sexually fantasizes about him (\\"Allison's Theme #1\\"). Gabe tells Aaron that he's romanticizing the memory of Allison, because he's only remembering the good things about her and not the bad things. He also tells Aaron to avoid bringing up Allison again, because it could ruin any future he might have with Casey. Aaron decides to fix the date by making more jokes, which leads to talk of jobs. Aaron describes his job at Wall Street, and expresses that all he likes about the job is that it pays well. Casey works at an art gallery which makes her somewhat happy because she can study her craft, photography. Aaron mentions how good her exhibit looked which leads Casey to conclude that he googled her before the date. She immediately does the same thing to him, and the two of them bond over embarrassing stuff on the internet (I.E. Aaron played Dolly in his high school production of Hello Dolly) (\\"The World Wide Web is Forever\\" or \\"Total Loser\\").Casey is hungry so she asks Aaron to leave the bar and eat dinner with her. Casey initially wants to order a burger, but Lauren tells her it will give the impression that years from now she will be overweight, so she orders a salad instead. Aaron, on the other hand, wants a salad, but Gabe tells him that \\"salads are for wussies,\\" so he orders a burger. Having overheard Casey talking to herself about wanting a burger, Aaron asks her why she ordered the salad, convinced that she wants to give the impression of being careful about her body. She ignores him, but he says that he doesn't care what a girl looks like as long as she's happy. Casey is taken aback by this, having never dated anyone who would have said something like that. She imagines her two ex-boyfriends berating her and telling her why she should love them, stating \\"reasons\\" such as \\"I failed my GED\\" or \\" I only cheated on you twice\\" (\\"That's Why You Love Me\\"). This makes Casey miss dating \\"bad boys,\\" leading her to ask Aaron if he's a bad boy, to which he replies with a no. Casey hastily calls off any potential relationship, saying they can be \\"just friends\\". Aaron offers to try to be a bad boy for her, but admits it probably wouldn't work. Casey's phone rings again, with another call from Reggie, who is beginning to feel ignored (\\"Bailout #2\\"). When Aaron leaves the table to go to the bathroom, Lauren visits Casey once more, where Casey admits that she builds up walls to keep herself from getting hurt, despite her desire for a real, healthy relationship. She explains that she only dates \\"bad boys,\\" or jerks, because she doesn't get her hopes up and is less disappointed when things don't work out. It is then revealed that her upbringing greatly influenced how she views relationships, having grown up with a mentally unstable mother and a father who left them and started a new family. Lauren, on the other hand, met her future husband in college at 24, and is happily married, confusing Casey's view of relationships even more (\\"Safer\\"). When Aaron returns to the table, he and Casey decide to officially call off the date. The waiter who seated them notices that they are the only ones not having a good time, so he performs a musical number that he wrote himself as the other two couples slow dance together. He pulls up Casey to dance, and pushes her to dance with Aaron (\\"I'd Order Love\\"). Their food finally arrives and Aaron, with what little hope he has left that things will end well, begs her to have just this one meal with him. Casey agrees, but decides she wants to set Aaron up with one of her friends to make up for their bad date. She asks him what kind of girl is his type, which gets him thinking about Allison again (\\"Allison's Theme #2\\"). She asks him if he wants a bad girl or somebody to take home to his mom, and Aaron says that he could probably bring any girl home to his mother. Casey begins to tease him, thinking this means his mom hates all of girls Aaron dates, but Aaron admits that his mother died when he was in tenth grade. He imagines her telling him everything she wished she had said to him, based on a letter she left him (\\"The Things I Never Said\\"). Casey is truly touched by Aaron's story and honesty, and subsequently ignores her phone when it rings again. Reggie is now convinced that Aaron killed her or kidnapped her because she hasn't picked up her phone, so he declares that he's coming to rescue her (\\"Bailout #3\\"). Casey realizes that she's beginning to like Aaron, and she asks him if they can switch their food so that they can both have what they want. She then remembers that she promised to set Aaron up with a friend, so she begins listing friends who would be a good match for Aaron. Casey ultimately decides it's her new friend Allison, which scares Aaron, thinking Casey is talking about his ex-girlfriend Allison. Much to Aaron's relief, it's not the same Allison, but Casey asks him why he reacted to dramatically to the name Allison. Aaron tells Casey about his relationship with Allison, and how she ended up leaving him at the altar. Casey decides to make Aaron try an exercise where he imagines Allison is standing right in front of him, and he has to break up with her. It doesn't start well, with Aaron only talking about how much he loves Allison, but with Casey's encouraging, he gets angry at Allison and lists everything he hated about her and how horribly she treated him (\\"In Love With You\\"). Casey and Aaron share an ecstatic embrace after Aaron's cathartic exchange with an imaginary Allison. After Casey and Aaron finish their dinner, the waiter brings them the check. The whole restaurant freezes, wondering who is going to pay for dinner (\\"The Check!\\"). Casey wants them to split it but Aaron pays it, insisting that he genuinely wants to buy her dinner. Casey realizes that she likes Aaron so much that she doesn't want to ever have to say goodbye to him, so she ignores him as he leaves. Lauren appears again, angry at her for screwing things up again, but Casey ignores her. The restaurant closes, so Casey walks out; she then realizes what a big mistake she's made. After she has left, Reggie runs into the restaurant, only to discover that Casey is not dead and left alone. Exhausted, he decides to have a drink with the waiter, and the two of them form their own first impressions of each other (\\"First Impressions (reprise)\\"). The scene then shifts to the next block, where Casey stops Aaron from entering the subway to go home. She asks him to walk her home, which he does. Along the way, Casey decides that she feels a true connection and sees potential with Aaron, and Aaron feels like he would be willing to risk his heart again if it was for Casey. Throughout the walk, all of the voices that have been talking to them all night voice their opinions but Casey and Aaron ignore them. When they reach Casey's apartment, they say goodnight to each other and go their separate ways. However, Casey stands in front of her apartment building, not wanting to actually walk inside and leave Aaron, and Aaron can't seem to walk further down the street to leave. Casey and Aaron sing the last verse on opposite sides of the stage, and as Casey and Aaron finish the song, they run from opposite sides of the stage and kiss (\\"Something That Will Last\\").
