The old Berlin Nordbahnhof was a short-lived passenger railway terminus in Berlin, Germany.

Geography The station was located at the junction point of Eberswalder Stra√üe with Bernauer Stra√üe, close to the \\"Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark\\". The sportpark's tramway stop (line M10) serves the area. History Berlin Nordbahnhof opened on July 10, 1877 as the southern terminus of the Berlin Northern Railway Berlin-Stralsund. The passenger traffic was handled by the nearby Stettiner Bahnhof, located at the western end at Bernauer Stra√üe. The Nordbahnhof was a freight yard only except for the years from 1892 to 1898 when a part of local traffic started from Nordbahnhof instead of Stettiner Bahnhof during construction works there. In 1950 the Stettiner Bahnhof took the name Nordbahnhof because the city of Stettin went to Poland and GDR government did not want to use German names for Polish cities. The old Nordbahnhof was renamed to G√ºterbahnhof (freight yard) Eberswalder Stra√üe. After the building of the Berlin Wall, in 1961, only a small part of local freight traffic remaint. It was finally closed in 1985. After 2000 a large fraction of the area became part of the Mauerpark. The Mauerpark and the Old Nordbahnhof on berlin.de Nowadays the ground where the station's tracks were located is the seat of the Mauerpark, a commemorative park about the Berlin Wall on the former \\"death strip\\" nearby Bernauer Stra√üe.

Kostandin Shpataraku (; 17361767), also commonly known as Shpataraku, was an Albanian Orthodox icon and fresco painter of the Post-Byzantine period in the eighteenth century. He continued to combine Byzantine tradition with influences from the Renaissance. He is regarded as one of the most prominent figures of medieval Albanian art besides Onufri and David Selenica. Kostandin Shpataraku was born in the Shpat region within the surrounding region of Elbasan, which was at that time part of the Ottoman Empire. He was beheaded by the Ottomans in Elbasan whereby his family took his body and buried him in his village, head apart from the rest of the body, so the Ottomans could not find his exact grave. A small chapel was built subsequently to commemorate him. He is also commemorated as a saint by the locals on September 21.Tomb and works of Kostandin Shpataraku (in Albanian) His art and legacy was distinguished by his miniatures by introducing elements from everyday life in visual art. His artistic work is represented by a collection of icons and frescoes for example inside the Ardenica Monastery and St. Jovan Vladimir's Church. Many of his works belong to private collections. Several works have been collected and restored and are nowadays on display at the National Museum of Medieval Art in Kor√ß√´, National Iconographic Museum in Berat and other museums.

The purpose of this type of sextant was to get an accurate position of a ship at sea. Burt applied the principles of his earlier solar compass invention to this new navigational instrument.  History  William Austin Burt exhibited his prior invention of the solar compass at the Great Exhibition Crystal Palace in the 1851 London's World Fair. In the return trip to Philadelphia from Europe Burt intentionally took back to America a slower sailing vessel that took six weeks time. He wanted to observe what happened out at sea and took notes on this longer ocean trip. He wanted to apply the technology of his Solar Compass invention to make a guide for sailors at sea, like he had done for surveyors in the wilderness. Burt noticed on this six week trip that the captain was misguided by the ship's compass, which caused the ship to go off course several times delaying the arrival. He applied his findings and experiments of this return trip to his Solar Compass with the idea to help navigation become easier and more accurate. The resulting instrument he devised called the equatorial sextant lived up to his expectations of being as useful to ship captains as his solar compass was to the surveyor. Shortly after he had designed his Equatorial Sextant he retired as a surveyor to devote his time to teaching the use of this special navigational instrument. He moved to Detroit for this purpose. Burt & Bailey company of Detroit built his first prototype by the early part of 1855. Burt had obtained an accurate reading within five degrees on board the ship Illinois on its historic first journey through the Soo Canal on June 18, 1855. In March 1856 Burt sent a sample of one of his Equatorial Sextants to the Navy Department. He sent another sample to the U.S. Coast Guard. They both agreed that Burt's Equatorial Sextant met the purpose of its design. His precision instrument was then finalized and approved on patent No. 16,002 in the United States and officially recorded on November 4, 1856.United States Letters Patent No. 16,002 (Nov. 4, 1856) - Equatorial Sextant He envisioned a greater worldwide potential for his nautical instrument than for that of his surveying instrument of the Solar Compass. Burt instructed lake captains in the use of this new sextant and gave them classes in astronomy and navigation. The captains learned valuable knowledge taught from \\"old salts\\" and they were able to make successful winter trips across the Atlantic with just their lake schooners. Burt died, however, two years after he patented the Equatorial Sextant and he was not able to perfect his new navigational aid.  Description  Burt equatorial sextant patent drawings Burt made the first equatorial sextant. It was patented in the United States in 1856 as number 16,002 and followed by 1857 patents in England, France and Belgium. His instrument eliminated the dependency upon a nautical chart to figure out a ship's position at sea. His instrument was used to take azimuths, latitude, and hour angle at any time of day with one observation when properly manipulated. Burt's sextant had two principal rings. The inner latitude ring could rotate 90 degrees inside the outer meridian ring. An azimuth ring was attached to the meridian ring. A ship's bearing was determined by settings of the astronomical triangle consisting of declination, latitude, altitude, hour angle, and azimuth. Three of these were used. The main purpose of Burt's new instrument was to determine the variation of the needle in the magnetic compass for a more accurate reading of a ship's position at sea. Its principles of operation came from the basics of the mechanics of Burt's solar compass invention patented some twenty years earlier. Burt claimed in his patent that he took the common sextant and combined it with his special mechanical techniques of horizontal and equatorial movement settings to obtain latitude, time, azimuth, altitude and declination without having to figure it out mathematically as they were read directly off the instrument. Many problems in nautical astronomy are solved at once with the use of the Equatorial Sextant. It has the capability of reading off the latitude, hour angle, and azimuth without computation thereby eliminating mathematical errors. It can do these readings any time of the day. It is a combination of the reflecting sextant with meridian, azimuth, and hour circles. It is designed to give immediately the azimuth and hour angle by observation of the altitudes of the heavenly bodies. The corresponding angles are read off on the respective circles, thereby giving the position of a ship at sea at once with the use of a marine chronometer.  Legacy  The University of Michigan received Burt's original 1858 Equatorial Sextant from his heirs in 1909 as an heirloom to navigation and engineering. It came with a pamphlet of Instructions on how to use it which was written by the inventor. The reason it was given to the college is because the university specializes in Navigation and Engineering study courses.

Background  \\"Crumblin' Down\\" was written by Mellencamp and longtime writing partner George Green. It was the last song recorded for Uh-Huh; after listening to the masters for the other tracks recorded, Mellencamp decided that the album needed a song that would work as the album's lead single. He contacted Green, with whom he had previously written \\"Hurts So Good,\\" to solicit ideas. Green had begun a song with lines about walls crumbling down; he and Mellencamp then built the song by trading lines, attempting to top one another. According to Green, the song attempts to answer the question of what to do when success eventually fades, and \\"the big- time deal falls through.\\" The song touches on Mellencamp's fame as well as the frustrations of losing one's livelihood: the lyrics were inspired, in part, by Mellencamp's cousin losing his job as an electrical engineer. In a 2016 Mellencamp-dedicated exhibit at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, a display was emblazoned with the following quote from Mellencamp: \\"Crumblin' Down is a very political song that I wrote with my childhood friend George Green.

Organizational history  =Origins= The organizations founding came about as a result of a case of censorship on the campus of the City College of New York in 1931. The Social Problems Club had begun publishing a new magazine, Frontiers, in March 1931 that contained an anti-ROTC editorial. College president Frederick C. Robinson had copies of the magazine confiscated and suspended the charter of the Social Problems Club. When Club members published a leaflet protesting this, he suspended them as well. The students formed a broad alliance with left leaning groups in other New York colleges to form a protest and letter writing campaign in favor of the suspended students, who were eventually reinstated. They organized themselves permanently as the New York Intercollegiate Student Council, composed of eleven student groups on seven local campuses. Later that fall they reorganized as the New York Student League and finally as the National Student League over the 1931-1932 Christmas break.Robert Cohen, When the Old Left was Young: Student Radicals and America's First Mass Student Movement, 1929-1941. New York, Oxford University Press, 1993; pp. 31-33, p. 351 notes 31 and 33. Unlike other \\"mass organizations\\" of the time, the initial impetus for the NSLs creation did not come from Communist Party or Young Communist League leadership, but began as a \\"grassroots\\" effort of Communist and Communist sympathizing students at CCNY and the other New York colleges. The YCL was focusing more on blue collar youth at the time and was hesitant about recruiting among \\"bourgeois\\" college youth. The YCL approved the group's creation, however, and provided some of the initial contacts to create an inter-campus organization.Cohen, When the Old Left was Young, pp. 34, 36. = Activism = The NSL began making a name for itself by involvement in the TUUL-led Harlan County miners strike. Inspired by the example of Waldo Frank and Theodore Dreiser's writers' delegation, the group decided to send a student delegation to Harlan County to provide relief for the striking miners and to investigate conditions in the area. About eighty students departed New York for Kentucky by bus on March 23, 1932. The students were met by angry crowds and police harassment and were unable to aid the strike, though the trip generated a large amount of publicity for the strike and the NSL.Cohen, When the Old Left was Young, pp. 46-53. That April the NSL became active in the campaign to defend Reed Harris, editor of the Columbia Spectator who had been expelled after writing a series of editorials on conditions in Columbia's dining halls. The NSL quickly came to Harris's defense, organizing protest meetings which drew hundreds of students and, on April 6, 1932, the first collegiate student strike of the decade. Despite opposition from the faculty, athletes and the local fraternities, enough pressure was kept on the Columbia administration to persuade it to re-instate Harris on April 20.Cohen, When the Old Left was Young, pp. 61-65. The NSL participated in a number of free speech fights, protests against student fee hikes and anti-war activity until its merger with the Student League for Industrial Democracy to form the American Student Union in December 1935. One of its most dramatic activities was organizing the National Student Strike Against War on April 13, 1934 and 1935, commemorating American entry into the First World War. The first strike, coordinated with the SLID, drew 25,000 students nationwide, 15,000 of whom were in New York City. The second demonstration, however, in April 1935, drew 175,000 students, 160,000 of whom outside of New York, and was co-sponsored by the National Student Federation of America, the National Council of Methodist Youth, YMCA, YWCA, the Interseminary Movement, and the youth section of the American League Against War and Fascism, among others.Cohen, When the Old Left was Young, pp. 92-93. An important aspect of the two annual strikes was an Americanized version of the Oxford Pledge, in which students pledged \\"We will not support the government of the United States in any war it may conduct.\\" This became a point of tension in the period of negotiation on the merger with SLID, because the NSL, following the Comintern line after the Seventh World Congress in summer 1935, came out in favor of a Popular front against fascism and Collective security which seemed at odds with the isolationist and pacifist spirit of the pledge.Cohen, When the Old Left was Young, pp. 73, 134-142. = Merger = With the NSL and the SLID working together so often, sentiment in favor of amalgamation began to form within both groups. The NSL took the first steps toward unity by inviting the SLID to the Student Congress Against War in Chicago in December 1932. Though organized on the basis of the Communist-led World Congress Against War that had been held that August in Amsterdam, the NSL succeeded in toning down the Third Period anti-socialist rhetoric, and succeeded in getting the SLID behind the Congress, as well as many pacifist organizations.Cohen, When the Old Left was Young, pp. 86-89. The NSL's conference later that month officially proposed a merger. Despite being rebuffed, the NSL passed another pro-amalgamation resolution the next year. The SLID was initially suspicious of the NSL's proposals; SLID regarded itself as the more genuinely democratic group and was wary of the NSL's uncritical view of the USSR. Nevertheless after the success of the April 1935 peace strike and growing sentiment in favor of anti-fascist unity in the face of repression, the SLID merged with NSL and a group of unorganized liberal students to form the American Student Union in December 1935.Cohen, When the Old Left was Young, pp. 137-140.

Sandulescu was conscripted in Romania at age sixteen by the occupying Russian army in the latter days of World War II and transported to work in the coal mines of the Donbas region of Ukraine. The book describes life in Europe in the immediate aftermath of the war from the perspective of the author's experiences as a displaced person and his involvement with the black market of the time. Synopsis Hunger's Rogues takes up the author's story about a year after he escaped from forced labor in the Russian mines, recounted in Donbas. The book opens in 1948 with Sandulescu approaching Transit Camp Buchholz, a camp for displaced persons, or \\"DPs\\", awaiting permission to emigrate overseas, then located outside of Hanover, Germany, near the village of Buchholz. The author describes camp and camp life, then unfolds his involvement, through friendships made in camp, with the thriving black market primarily based in the train stations of cities throughout Germany and the countries formerly occupied by the Nazi regime. After passing initial emigrant screening, Sandulescu fails the medical exam due to elevated blood pressure and is forced to remain in camp for an extended period until he can be re- tested. As he waits for the next opportunity for a medical exam, the excitement of trading on the black market continues to draw him in. Sandulescu recounts black market trades and affairs that include selling pork from a clandestine farmhouse slaughter, a trip to Belgium disguised as a US soldier to buy 150 pounds of coffee and a trip in the company of a Red Army officer from the Balkans to Paris to buy and peddle cigarettes. He gives market prices for black market goods, primarily food, and the exchange rate in terms of packs of cigarettes, as American cigarettes were the most widely accepted currency at the time. The book includes vivid word pictures of the lives of ordinary civilians in the aftermath of the war, with rationing and shortages leading many to trade on the black market to eat well or just to survive. The book ends with Sandulescu describing his clearance to emigrate and his boarding a ship to Canada. In an epilogue, the author describes returning to Germany in 1954 as a US citizen and soldier. Obtaining leave from his unit, he travels to the small village where he had buried, six years earlier in a heavily wooded area, fourteen golden goblets looted from a Bavarian castle. When he reaches the place, he finds an apartment building on the spot. Not willing to risk calling attention to his involvement in the six-year-old theft, Sandulescu inquires only as to how long the building had been standing. He learns from a passerby that the apartment building had been built three years before. Fearing to ask further questions about any artifacts uncovered during construction, Sandulescu returns to his army unit having never learned the fate of \\"his\\" treasure. Author Jacques Sandulescu was born February 21, 1928, in Romania, and died November 19, 2010, in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. In addition to his autobiographical books, Sandulescu wrote fiction and was a boxer, bar-owner and actor. His acting career began in 1970, with a small role in The Owl and the Pussycat, and continued until 2002 (his last job was on Law & Order: Criminal Intent). He was a personal friend of author Whitley Strieber, and is mentioned in Strieber's book Communion as having been present at some of the events that purportedly occurred at that time.

It was closed in 1956 and put into caretaker status. As of at least the 2000s, parts of the facility have been converted to a civil picnic area called Sampson State Park. In addition, the United States Navy operates the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) sonar test facility on a part of the facility. However, most of the former base is abandoned. History =USNTS Sampson= The facility was established initially by the United States Navy as a Naval Training Station (USNTS Sampson) in 1942. The station was named after Rear Admiral William T. Sampson. The Navy obtained 2,600 acres of former farmland and also vineyards for the facility on the east side of Lake Seneca, New York. Construction of the facility took 270 days to complete. Along with the training station, a 1500-bed hospital was constructed. The mission of USNTS Sampson was Naval basic training for large numbers of new recruits. During the war, over 411,000 recruits were trained at the station In conjunction with the building of Sampson, the United States Army established its Seneca Army Depot adjacent to the Naval Station which was used to store a wide variety of Ammunition. =Postwar use= With the end of the war, USNTS Sampson was closed, and turned over to the War Assets Administration in 1946. Most of the facility was taken over by New York State which planned to establish a two-year junior community college on the facility, keeping most of the buildings and using it as a campus. The USN Hospital was eventually taken over by the state of New York, renaming it the Willard State Hospital Sampson Annex in 1947. The Station was used by NYS as a temporary college for 15,000 GI Bill students in July 1946. (5 barracks were moved to Hobart College in Geneva, New York, 7 were moved to Syracuse University) Sampson College operated from September 1946 to June 1949 and had matriculated 7,500 students of which 950 received two-year degrees. In 1949, the former Naval Station was turned over to the United States Department of Agriculture, which used the buildings as warehouses and granaries. More than 110,000 bushels of excess wheat and 15,000 sacks of excess beans were stored at Sampson. In addition, the State of New York, realizing the scenic location of the former Naval Station, appropriated $50,000 for the creation of a state park at Sampson. =Sampson AFB= 3650th Military Training Wing - Emblem Retreat Ceremony in front of Base Headquarters Wartime graduation of new airmen, BMT Flight 1513 3691 BMTS June 1952. Many of these airmen probably served in the Korean War after technical training. With the outbreak of the Korean War, the United States Air Force took interest in the former Naval Station for use as a Basic Military Training Base. Custody of the most of the property of the training center was transferred to the Air Force in 1950, and the Air Force named the facility Sampson Air Force Base on 15 November 1950. With the Air Force establishing Sampson AFB, the park project was cancelled. The Air Force spent about $6 million on renovations and beginning in February 1951 started training what would be 16,000 Air Force recruits. Air Training Command established the 3650th Indoctrination (later Military Training) Wing to manage the base and conduct Basic Training, as its major facility at Lackland AFB, Texas was overflowing. During the first two weeks of 1951, the population at Lackland AFB jumped from 36,513 to over 70,000 people. In addition, a third BMT center was established at Parks AFB, California to accommodate new enlistees. The mission of Sampson AFB was to provide formal basic training for all male and female enlisted personnel not having sufficient previous military training; to establish and operate such assembly, processing and separation station as specifically directed; to provide a comprehensive counseling program for Basic Indoctrinee personnel in order that these airmen may be most effectively assigned in accordance with Air Force requirements; and to maintain training programs for accomplishing rehabilitation of garrison prisoners. The first trainees arrived on 1 Feb 1951. The base employed about 700 civilians and had 600 permanent party troops. During the years before the Korean War, basic military training had lasted anywhere from 4 to 13 weeks. In the rush to flow recruits through the training system and into the theater of conflict, ATC reduced the course to seven weeks in 1950 and then to two weeks in January 1951. With the opening of Sampson and Parks AFB for BMT, Shortly thereafter, ATC increased basic military training from seven weeks to eight. In July 1952 the Air Staff approved a 12-week course, which ATC implemented on 1 August at Lackland and Parks and on 1 September at Sampson. However, after only two months, the Air Staff decided that the course should be shortened, and ATC developed an 11-week program to begin in January 1953. The host organization at Sampson was redesigned as the 3650th Military Training Wing, Air Training Command, in March 1953. The Air Force also built a runway and other facilities at Sampson and converted the base to its needs. By 1953, a single paved 5000 foot north/south runway (Rwwy 17/35) was completed and a control tower, fire station and aircraft parking ramp was built on the west side, with B-25 Mitchell, C-47 Skytrain, and C-45 Expeditor aircraft assigned. With the end of the Korean War and cutbacks in the military budget afterwards, Air Training Command discontinued its basic training school at Sampson AFB on 1 July 1956. Shortly thereafter, ATC discontinued Sampson's 3650th Military Training Wing. By the time it was closed, over 300,000 airmen received basic training at Sampson AFB in preparation for service in the Korean War, as well as service in USAFE, Far East Air Force, and other United States Air Force major commands both in the United States and around the world. Three months later, on 1 October 1956, control of Sampson AFB was transferred to the Rome Air Force Depot, Air Materiel Command and the base was placed in standby status. =Post military use= Starting in 1957 to 1960 the airfield and some officer housing on the lake shore (449 acres) were transferred to the Seneca Army Depot, the facility being renamed Sampson Army Airfield and used to support the depot. The former hospital area was operated as a state school. In 1971, the State of New York closed the School due to budget cuts and while empty, a fire destroyed most of the main hospital complex. Contaminated by asbestos, the site was cleaned and is still owned by the Department of Mental Hygiene when it burned down in 1989. In 1960 the State of New York purchased and assumed ownership of all tracts of land on the former base at a cost of $500,000. Most of the buildings were dismantled and materials were sold for re-usage throughout the Finger Lakes Region. One of the Drill Halls is now in use at Middlebury College, Vermont. Major roads and identification signs remain today on the base. At some point in the mid-1960s, the airfield was opened to civil use as North Star Seneca Airpark. The duration of the civilian use of the Seneca airfield has not been determined, but it was evidently a brief period as the Army returned it to military control during the Vietnam War and renamed it Seneca Army Airfield. It was used for security at Seneca Army Depot, with the former fire station being used as hangars for the helicopters supporting depot security. Air Force C-123 and C-130 cargo aircraft also used the runway on occasion for transporting personnel and material to the depot. The Seneca Army Depot was identified for closure in 1995 as part of the BRAC process and Seneca AAF was closed by 2000. Today Today the airfield is being developed into an emergency services training site. Just inside the gate is a brand new State Police barracks, and sharing the building is a police & fire training center. A new fire training tower was built southeast of the control tower, and the 7,000-foot runway is used for high-speed police pursuit training. The control tower & fire station are empty. The majority of the former Air Force base today is now abandoned. While the streets exist, most of the land is vacant as a result of the 1960 New York State facilities removal. However, a large cluster of buildings in the northeast part of the base remain in a very deteriorated condition, some having roofs, some not. The main gate on Sampson State Park Road, west of the intersection with NY Highway 96A , still stands guard over the base. The Sampson Air Force Museum is currently located in the building which was formerly the old stockade/brig. The displays are quite extensive, including a restored T-33 Shooting Star aircraft on static display and a Falcon Memorial statue. References * Manning, Thomas A.

Early life and education Thompson grew up in the 1970s and the 1980s in Toronto, Canada. He spent his childhood working with early models of computers. He tried to understand programs for games and for artificial intelligence as a child but did not succeed, so he chose not to study science. Thompson graduated from the University of Toronto with majors in political science and English in 1992. He previously worked for Canada's Report on Business magazine, This Magazine, and Shift magazine, then became a freelance contributor for The New York Times Magazine, The Washington Post, Lingua Franca, Wired, Shift, Entertainment Weekly and several other publications. Professional work Thompson writes about digital technologies and their social and cultural impact for a number of publications, including the New York Times Magazine and Wired. Thompson originally wrote about the emergence of technology, much like Nicholas Carr, another author on the subject. However, Thompson now describes the \\"global self-expression\\" afforded to humanity by new forms of media. He writes about how tools affect how we think, but states that there are benefits from social thinking on internet. Thompson developed the idea of \\"ambient awareness,\\" or the connections humans develop with each other through quick status updates throughout the day that ultimately end up being deep, intellectual and still social. He does acknowledge that ambient contact has caused the world to become too focused on the present. For Thompson, the internet is text that one can use to talk, argue, insult and compliment others with. Thompson stated in an interview that the internet will never replace cities because cities are too dynamic to replicate through technology. Thompson also states that cities and technology are connected because both are a way to foster connections. He writes that humanity is not yet overwhelmed by technology, and that humans have always faced new challenges with technology. Thompson's blog, Collision Detection, started in 2002 and attracts over 3000 hits a day. Awards and accolades In 2002, he was awarded a Knight Science Journalism Fellowship at MIT.

VCU Medical Center used to be known as Medical College of Virginia (MCV), which merged with Richmond Professional Institute in 1968 to create Virginia Commonwealth University. In the 1990s, an authority controlling MCV Hospitals was created called the Medical College of Virginia Hospitals Authority. In 2004, the name of this authority was changed to VCU Health System and the MCV Hospitals and surrounding campus were branded VCU Medical Center. This authority controls the employees and real estate occupied by the five schools within the VCU Medical Center. It was at this time that the MCV Campus moniker was created. West Hospital houses various clinical, administrative and support services of the hospitals of VCU Medical Center; clinical, academic and administrative units of the School of Medicine; and academic and administrative units of the School of Allied Health Professions. Today the VCU Medical Center is composed of the hospitals and five schools and is located on the MCV Campus, adjacent to the Virginia BioTechnology Research Park. * College of Health Professions * School of Dentistry * School of Medicine * School of Nursing * School of Pharmacy The VCU Medical Center VCU Medical Center has 865 Licensed Beds with a total of 85,700 Emergency Department visits in 2012.

There were forty-six students enrolled in the first class lasting from November 5, 1838 ‚Äì April 4, 1839.Hoke 1963: 11 Students paid $20 to the professors for each of the six courses.Hoke 1963: 10 =1850‚Äì1861= The Medical Department of Hampden-Sydney College received an independent charter from the General Assembly in 1854 and became the Medical College of Virginia (MCV), and shortly thereafter transferred all its property to the Commonwealth and became a state institution in 1860.Hoke 1963: 21 There had not been a separate hospital where patients could be housed within the College buildings since the beginning. A new hospital, known as the College Infirmary, was built at a cost of $22,336.57 and opened in April, 1861.Hoke 1963: 26 =Civil War= Soon the Civil War erupted, and the College found itself playing an important role in the education of Confederate surgeons and in the hospital care of wounded and sick military personnel.Hoke 1963: 28 During the Civil War, the school remained open and it graduated a class every year throughout the conflict. The MCV is the only Southern medical school still in existence to have done so.Hoke 1963: 30 =1866‚Äì1881= In 1867, the college's first outpatient clinic was established when the faculty agreed to cooperate with the Freedmen's Bureau and the City of Richmond in the establishment of a \\"dispensary for the relief of the sick poor, both white and colored.\\"Hoke 1963: 37 Solomon Marable's body was found packed into a barrel of salt for preservation in the dissection room. In the late 1800s, African American janitor Chris Baker became notorious for obtaining cadavers for dissection by students. One case in 1898 was subject to an expos√© by Richmond Planet publisher John Mitchell, Jr. and included grisly sketches of the proceedings. Baker's success, however, led to one professor saying the school could be called \\"Chris Baker's College\\" in 1898.Brooks, Vince. Chris Baker: \\"Cheerful Among Corpses\\", Out of the Box, Notes from the Archives @ the Library of Virginia, October 27, 2010, accessed November 16, 2016 at http://www.virginiamemory.com/blogs/out_of_the_box/2010/10/27/chris-baker- cheerful-among-corpses/Man and Barrel, Richmond Planet (Richmond, Virginia) August 1, 1896, page 1, accessed November 16, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/7474861/httpswwwnewspaperscomclip7474762/ =The University College of Medicine= A second medical school, the \\"College of Physicians and Surgeons\\" (later the \\"University College of Medicine\\"), was founded by Dr. Hunter McGuire in 1893, just two squares from the Egyptian Building.Hoke 1963: 33 The new college was composed of three schools: medicine, dentistry and pharmacy. The University College of Medicine was destined to have a life span of only twenty years as an independent institution. The Flexner Report of 1909 suggested that the two schools would be better off merging, which they then did in 1913, retaining the Medical College of Virginia name.Hoke 1963: 34 =1913 Rankings with Dr. Christopher Tompkins= Dean Tompkins said in retirement talk in 1913, \\"From a school whose matriculants numbered, as I can remember it, 22 during the session and whose standing amongst medical colleges in the country was so insignificant that it was not worth noticing, the matriculants have increased to‚Äîin one session‚Äîas many as 306. In a recent table compiled December 1911, from the reports of the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association, it was found that of all the medical colleges in the United States and taking them in the order in which their graduates passed the various medical examining boards, the Medical College of Virginia stood fourth; the order in which they came being, (1) Rush, (2) Johns Hopkins, (3) Cornell, (4) Medical College of Virginia, and about one hundred and forty behind them.\\"Hoke 1963: 55 =Discussion over number of medical schools= The year 1920 revived a discussion that had gone on for years without resolution of the issues involved. Repeatedly, the view had been expressed that the Medical College of Virginia and the University of Virginia Department of Medicine might well be consolidated with benefit both to the schools and to the public. In 1867, 1905, and 1913 the question emerged, and, finally, in 1920 a really serious study was undertaken. In reviewing appropriations. Governor Westmoreland Davis noted that Virginia was supporting two medical schools, seemingly in competition and surmised that this might well be uneconomic, particularly at a time when money was tight. Acting on the Governor's recommendation, the General Assembly authorized a Commission on Medical Education. The commission made a thorough study. It recommended that Virginia support only one medical school, that this school be in Richmond, and that it be the Department of Medicine of the University of Virginia under the full and sole control of the Rector and Visitors of the University, and, finally, that the plan be effective upon the unconditional transfer of all Medical College of Virginia properties and assets to the Rector and Visitors of the University. The Board of Visitors of the Medical College of Virginia was in favor and by resolution determined that the college would willingly embrace the plan should the commission's recommendations be accepted by the Legislature. Instead, the alumni of the University under the leadership of the eminent Dr. Hugh Young of Johns Hopkins Medical School waged a mighty campaign to preserve the medical school in status quo at Charlottesville. The report was approved overwhelmingly in the House but died by a 24-16 tally in the Senate. In view of the state's growth, the action of the Senate was most fortunate. Had the report won approval, Virginia would have found herself today facing the organization of another medical school with a minimum price tag of 30 million dollars. The issue was to rise again in 1947, but only briefly, as the handwriting on the wall was by that time quite clear.Hoke 1963: 61 =The Great Depression and expansion= The Great Depression struck the college with perhaps more force than in the case of some other institutions. MCV was struggling to secure funds without which specialized structures and trained personnel, both expensive, could not be had. Plans laid prior to 1930 with early fruition apparently possible had to be put aside, notably the projected laboratory and outpatient building. Salaries, never high, had to be cut.Hoke 1963: 66 By 1941, the modern 600-bed, 18-story MCV Hospital was completed; the Egyptian Building had been completely reconstructed to provide up-to-date facilities for the departments of bacteriology and pathology, and the 300-seat Simon Baruch Auditorium in the Egyptian motif, named for Dr. Simon Baruch, class of 1862, whose distinguished son, Bernard M. Baruch, helped make the restoration possible. Also by 1941, new quarters were provided for the departments of physiology and pharmacology by adding a fourth story to McGuire Hall. In the brief span of five years, a remarkable program of physical expansion had been completed.Hoke 1963: 68 =1956‚Äì1963= The interest of individuals, organizations, and agencies, other than those of the Commonwealth, may be gauged by their provision, since 1956, of gifts, grants, and contracts for teaching, research, and capital improvements totaling a little over $15 million. Reflecting the stimulating influence of such support, the college is fully accredited, with University status, and alive with enthusiasm, as the faculty and staff go about their mission of providing for the education of some 1200 students enrolled in 10 schools and courses, plus some 200 young physicians in residence for further training, of caring for the sick who occupy its 1308 beds, and finally, of seeking new knowledge for their benefit.Hoke 1963: 83 In 1962, the college absorbed the black students from the St. Philip School of Nursing during the implementation of integration. The $6.5 million Medical Education Building was completed in the summer of 1963. It was the most important addition to the physical plant of the College since the completion of the Medical College of Virginia Hospital in 1940. With the added facilities of this building, the school of medicine was able to increase enrolment from 84 to 128 students.Hoke 1963: 87 =Becoming VCU= In 1968, the state legislature merged the Medical College of Virginia with the Richmond Professional Institute to form the Virginia Commonwealth University. During this merger, the agreement stipulated that the MCV would retain its name in perpetuity. The exact title by the act was \\"The Medical College of Virginia Health Sciences Division of Virginia Commonwealth University.\\" =Envisioning a great urban university= At the 1969 convocation for VCU, Dr. Brandt envisioned a great urban university, stating, \\"we are caught up in a thing you might call the Virginia Commonwealth University Idea. It's an exciting concept....an academic approach without precedent, VCU will become a name that will mean a great deal to you in years to come...as one of the leading educational institutions.\\"Commonwealth Times 1969-09-24 :: Commonwealth Times. Dig.library.vcu.edu (1969-09-24). Retrieved on 2013-08-21. =2004 name change= The previous administration led by President Eugene P. Trani had pursued a policy of promoting the VCU name as a unified identity to the outside world. This policy had included directing faculty, staff and students to use the VCU name instead of MCV in any official meetings or correspondence. This was accomplished by first the creation of the MCV Hospital Authority, ostensibly to better administer the MCV Hospitals, to a later name change of this Authority to the VCU Health System Authority (with MCV Hospitals being a component thereof). This Authority under the direction of Sheldon Retchin, MD then went about changing the physical appearance of the structures and advertising materials, to include letterhead and websites. The faculty and medical students at that time were instructed at that time to cease referring to the institution as the Medical College of Virginia. The main cited evidence for this was misrepresentation of the institution in the press. Dr. Retchin in 2004 sent an e-mail that described a 2003 front-page USA Today article which incorrectly referred to MCV as the \\"Virginia Medical College, a teaching arm of the University of Virginia,\\" when in fact MCV is not a part of the University of Virginia. The VCU Medical Center now resides on the MCV Campus of Virginia Commonwealth University. Since that time, the schools of that institution have been listed as a part of the VCU Medical Center rather than as a part of a university or college. =Research university= VCU expanded its research programs significantly over the past decade and has over $255 million in sponsored research. In 2010, VCU was selected by the NIH for a $20 million grant to become part of a nationwide consortium of research institutions working to turn laboratory discoveries into treatments for patients.Buckley, Anne.

The only other university built in this style was the College of Cape Town, South Africa, now the University of Cape Town. * The Three Bears - The sculpture of the Three Bears that now rests on the first floor of the Gateway Building has served as an unofficial mascot and symbol for the MCV Hospitals for more than sixty years. Dr. William T. Sanger, President of the Medical College of Virginia from 1925 to 1956, saw the original sculpture of the bear group in January 1940. The bears, created by noted American sculptor Anna Hyatt Huntington, were displayed at Brookgreen Gardens, the renowned sculpture garden and nature retreat created in South Carolina by Huntington and her husband Archer Milton Huntington. Sanger thought the bears would make a nice addition to the entrance court for the new Medical College of Virginia Hospital on Broad Street that opened in January 1941. Huntington agreed to make a copy of the bears and she and her husband donated the sculpture to the Medical College of Virginia on October 9, 1941. The copy of the bears was cast in stone, not the original gray bronze because the metal was unavailable due to the war conditions in Europe. Sanger believed the bears were an appropriate subject for a sculpture at a medical institution.VCU Libraries  TML SC&A;  The Three Bears References *  External links  * Category:Virginia Commonwealth University Category:Healthcare in Richmond, Virginia Category:Educational institutions established in 1838 Category:1838 establishments in Virginia Category:V-12 Navy College Training Program ","title":"VCU Medical Center"},{"id":"29513425","text":"Vrion (Greek: ŒíœÅŒπœéŒΩŒπ, Vrioni) is a village in Vlor√´ County, southwestern Albania.

A Chilean court in 2014 found that the United States played a key role in Teruggi's murder.Chile: U.S. Had Role In 'Missing' Killings of Two Americans. NBC News, July 1, 2014. September 11, 1973 On September 11, 1973, the Chilean presidential Palace was bombed, and president Salvador Allende died. A coup d'√©tat led by General Augusto Pinochet took place in Chile and a military regime was imposed.Sept. 11, 1973: A CIA-backed Military Coup Overthrows Salvador Allende, the Democratically Elected President of Chile It has been referred as the Chilean coup of 1973. Teruggi's death, as well as the death of fellow journalist Charles Horman, occurred as a part of the wave of killings, torture and kidnappings that took place as the military regime solidified its control over the government of Chile. Teruggi's death along with Horman's death were the subject of the 1982 Costa-Gavras film Missing. Arrest and death On September 20, 1973, nine days after the coup d'√©tat, Frank Teruggi, in the same way as Charles Horman, was seized by the Chilean military at his home and taken to the National Stadium in Santiago, which had been turned into an ad hoc concentration camp, where prisoners were interrogated and tortured and many were executed. In the film Missing, by Costa-Gavras, Teruggi is depicted as a contributor for a small newspaper and friend of Charles Horman who had spoken with several US operatives that assisted the Chilean military government. The film alleges that Horman's discovery of US complicity in the coup led to his secret arrest, disappearance, and execution. American complicity in the Chilean coup was later confirmed in documents declassified during the Clinton administration. The declassified documents mention Teruggi as one of the Chilean military executions and initially US embassy officials in Santiago released false information that he had returned to the United States. His body was later found in a Chilean morgue among the \\"unidentified bodies\\" of the victims of the regime. Book, film, and television depictions of the case The main character of the Missing (1982), directed by Greek filmmaker Costa-Gavras, was Charles Horman, but Teruggi is also depicted and his fate is described in the film by David Hathaway, his roommate who was arrested at the same time Teruggi was. Teruggi was portrayed by actor Joe Regalbuto. When the film was released by Universal Studios, Nathaniel Davis, United States Ambassador to Chile from 1971 to 1973, filed a USD $150 million libel suit against the director and the studio, although he was not named directly in the movie (he had been named in the book). The court eventually dismissed Davis's suit. The film was removed from the market during the lawsuit but re-released upon dismissal of the suit. State Department memo For many years thereafter, the US government steadfastly maintained its ignorance of the killing and torture of Americans in Chile. It was only in October 1999, that President Bill Clinton ordered the release of a document admitting that US intelligence agents played a role in the deaths of Americans. The United States Department of State memo, dated August 25, 1976, was declassified on October 8, 1999, together with 1,100 other documents released by various US agencies which dealt primarily with the years leading up to the military coup. Written by three State Department functionaries -- Rudy Fimbres, R.S. Driscolle and W.V. Robertson and addressed to Harry Shlaudeman, a high-ranking official in the department's Latin American division -- the memo described the Horman and mentions Teruggi's case as well. 2011 indictments On November 29, 2011, Chilean judge Jorge Zepeda indicted Ray E. Davis, commander of the U.S. Military Group in Chile during the time of the coup, along with Pedro Espinoza, a Chilean general, and Rafael Gonz√°lez Verdugo, a member of Chilean army intelligence, in the murders of Frank Teruggi and Charles Horman. Teruggi and Horman were among the 40,000 who were detained in the Stadium. In 2012, Chile‚Äôs Supreme Court approved an extradition request for Davis. As of September 11, 2013, the U.S. had not been served with the request. Davis, secretly living in Chile, died in a Santiago nursing home in 2013.Chilean court links US intelligence to 1973 killings of two Americans. The Guardian, 1 July 2014. Retrieved 9 March 2015. In 2015 the court sentenced Espinoza to 7 and Verdugo to 2 years. Chile's Supreme Court however reviewed the case in 2016 and significantly increased the sentences to 15 years for Espinoza and 3 years for Verdugo. In addition they were ordered to pay $196,000 to Horman's widow and $151,000 to Teruggi's sister.Eva Vergara: Chile toughens sentences in ‚ÄòMissing‚Äô killings of Americans.

Wyatt had realised that this machinery would enable several machines to be powered from a single source of power: foreseeing the development of the factory system, he envisaged \\"a kind of mill, with wheels turned either by horses, water or wind.\\" History Finance for the Upper Priory enterprise came from Paul himself; from Thomas Warren, the Birmingham bookseller and newspaper publisher; Edward Cave, London-based publisher of The Gentleman's Magazine; and Robert James, a notable physician and inventor of a well-known \\"fever powder\\". The latter three were friends of the author and lexicographer Samuel Johnson, who had lived in Birmingham during the 1730s and whose family had been connected to that of Wyatt in Lichfield, and Johnson may have been responsible for introducing them to Paul.; The mill consisted of fifty spindles, turned by \\"two asses walking around an axis\\" and was tended initially by ten women. Contemporary observers make it clear that the machine was fundamentally effective, and hopes for the venture were initially very high. James wrote to Warren in July 1740: \\"Yesterday we went to see Mr. Paul's machine, which gave us all entire satisfaction both in regard to the carding and spinning. You have nothing to do but to get a purchaser for your grant; the sight of the thing is demonstration enough. I am certain that if Paul could begin with ¬£10,000 he must or at least might get more money in twenty years than the City of London is worth.\\" By 1743, however, the Upper Priory Mill was almost derelict.; Wyatt, who had assisted with the setting up of the mill, had offered to oversee its operation from December 1741, but was imprisoned for debt in the Fleet Prison in June 1742. A letter written to Wyatt during this period suggests the mill was badly mismanaged in his absence: \\"I think there's not one ass left alive, so what's done is only done by hand. There's not a man left at the work, but one Mr Rodgers an old man that came down from London when he could stay no longer, and he I find can't get money to live upon and almost starved....\\" Wyatt tried to gain orders for yarn from the mill when he was released in October 1743 but there is no record of the mill beyond this point, though it may have been the machinery from the Upper Priory that Wyatt sent to Northampton in 1757. A key weak point of Paul and Wyatt's machinery was its frailty, which saw it frequently out of order and in need of expensive repairs. It has also been suggested that the inability of Paul or Wyatt to organise a manufacturing operation with the necessary level of discipline and supervision may have been a key reason for the mill's failure. Andrew Ure wrote that Wyatt was \\"favourably placed, in a mechanical point of view, for maturing his admirable scheme. But he was a gentle and passive spirit, little qualified to cope with the hardships of a new manufacturing enterprise. It required, in fact, a man of a Napoleon nerve and ambition, to subdue the refractory tempers of work-people accustomed to irregular paroxysms of diligence.\\" Matthew Boulton, whose own Soho Manufactory successfully organised industrial production on an unprecedented scale from the 1760s onwards, was later to recall the Paul-Wyatt mill as \\"a good Cotton spinning mill\\" that \\"would have got money had it been in good hands\\". Despite the commercial failure of Paul and Wyatt's own factory, further mills were established using their machinery in Northampton and Leominster, and a second mill established in Birmingham, which remained in operation at least until the mid-1750s.

Played by Heshima Thompson, Asher is a main character in series two. He is a charismatic street dancer, who uses his talent to escape from his criminal past. As a father-figure to his younger brother Sol Levi (Tosin Cole), Asher occasionally resorts to stealing in order to provide for them both. He is willing to go to extreme lengths to protect Sol, including being stabbed by their schizophrenic mother. Over the course of the series, Asher betrays Sol by sleeping with his girlfriend, Naz Mehmet (Emaa Hussen). The two are ultimately able to reconcile, and Asher makes amends by encouraging his brother's dancing talent. The character was created by the programme's team of thirteen writers, alongside the series' other main characters: Sol, Naz, and their friend Stevie Dickinson (Amanda Fairbank- Hynes). Thompson appreciated that the role allowed him to combine his love of acting and dancing. It brought him public recognition, and led fans of the series to hope that he and the other main characters would appear in the parent show, EastEnders. Storylines After being evicted by their mother Caroline (Sandra Yaw), Asher and his younger brother Sol (Tosin Cole) move in with Walford resident Stevie Dickinson (Amanda Fairbank-Hynes). The brothers attend a dance audition, at which Asher is successful but Sol fails. Asher offers the judge a bribe on his brother's behalf, and is witnessed doing so by Fatboy (Ricky Norwood). He threatens him with a knife, revealing a stab wound on his abdomen, but disposes of the weapon when Fatboy leaves. While practicing dancing in the local community centre, Asher is mistaken for a Latin dance class instructor and steals the group's money. Though he attempts to find legitimate work, he is turned down due to having a criminal record, and again resorts to stealing. When Sol begins a romantic relationship with his new friend Naz Mehmet (Emaa Hussen), Asher tells Naz's fianc√©, Ekin Beg (Hemi Yeroham), that she is cheating on him. Ekin leads Sol to believe that Asher and Naz are an item, which causes Sol to insult them both. Annoyed, the two go clubbing together, and have sex after getting drunk and taking drugs. Naz later confesses the one-night stand to Sol, who punches his brother. He leaves Stevie's flat after Asher returns home drunk, having got into trouble selling stolen property. Asher later finds Sol with their mother, who has been hospitalised. It is revealed that she is schizophrenic, and that Asher's stab wound was caused by her. Asher apologises for sleeping with Naz, and tells Sol that she loves him. Finally, he encourages Sol to enter a dance competition. Though nervous, Sol is reassured by his brother and completes his routine to great acclaim. Other appearances Asher appears in extra video content on the E20 website. In one video, he and Sol argue during filming of an advert for \\"SmasherDance\\"‚Äîa video in which they demonstrate various dancing styles‚Äîas Sol is more interested in getting food. The full SmasherDance advert is also on YouTube. In another video, the four friends play a drinking game in the local caf√©, and in another he is an Elvis Presley impersonator marrying Naz and Ekin in Naz's nightmare. Creation, development and characterisation Heshima Thompson portrays Asher Levi. Asher is one of the four main characters in series two of EastEnders: E20, alongside Sol, Naz and Stevie. They were created by the programme's team of thirteen writers. Actor and singer Heshima Thompson auditioned for the series, having learned about it from his agent. Part of the process involved a dance audition with Tony Adigun, the leader of dance group Avant Garde. Thompson was subsequently cast as Asher, and the character and his casting were announced on 28 July 2010. Deborah Sathe, the show's producer, expressed pride in the writers and stated, \\"[They] have created four new faces for [Albert] Square and their reaction to Walford life is really exciting.\\" Thompson called E20 \\"a great project to be part of\\", and eagerly anticipated the dancing the role would entail. He later said in an interview with Daniel Kilkelly from entertainment news website Digital Spy that it was good to be able to combine his love of acting with his love of dance. Asher is described on the E20 website as being charming and sexy, with the talent to make him a star. Thompson deemed his character \\"very confident\\" and a \\"bit of a bad boy\\". He is a hustler, who finds it difficult to refuse easy money, and seizes opportunities regardless of their legality. He has a criminal past, having recently been released from prison for theft prior to the start of the series. Thompson explained that Asher becomes a street dancer to help keep himself away from crime, which he commits in order to provide for Sol. He stated that Asher would \\"try his best to stay out of trouble\\", but may return to crime through learned behaviour. Asher's life is complicated by his mother and brother. He has been a father-figure to Sol since a young age, and, as revealed in episode nine, has cared for him through their mother's schizophrenic episodes. Thompson assessed that Asher is not necessarily the best role model for Sol, but is willing to go to great lengths to protect him and ensure his success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch to secure Sol a place in the dance group. Thompson said that looking after Sol has \\"taken a toll on [Asher]\\". Although he initially feels optimistic about moving to Walford, he loses perspective and makes a mistake by sleeping with Naz. Thompson deemed this out of character for Asher, as he loves his brother so much, but opined that despite his mistakes, Asher is still a good brother: \\"At heart, he's like anyone trying to do well. He wants to escape his old past and do well by his brother.\\" Aware of his own sex appeal, Asher's confidence and dance ability mean he has little difficulty in attracting women. Thompson characterises him as having youthful fun, rather than being \\"dirty\\". He feels he is easily intimidating, and intelligent enough to use his unpleasant fa√ßade to his advantage. This is demonstrated in the first episode, when he threatens Fatboy with a knife despite having no intention of using it. Reception Appearing in EastEnders: E20 brought Thompson public recognition, from groups ranging from \\"screaming girls to proud parents\\". He has received comments on Asher's immoral behaviour, and compliments for his dancing.

Stevie is a main character in series 2, where she is joined by her new friends Asher Levi (Heshima Thompson), Sol Levi (Tosin Cole) and Naz Mehmet (Emaa Hussen). Stevie is described as posh, naive, kind, forward, creative and a daydreamer. She has a complicated relationship with her boyfriend Olly Manthrope-Hall (Joshua McGuire), and throughout the series, she falls for Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra), has an encounter with Pippa (Roxanne McKee) and gets revenge on Olly. Storylines After making love in their flat, Stevie's boyfriend Olly Manthrope-Hall (Joshua McGuire) ends his relationship with Stevie and moves out. He leaves her in the middle of Albert Square with some flyers he printed so she can find a new flatmate. Asher Levi (Heshima Thompson) sees the flyers and helps Stevie up. She invites him back to her flat, and asks him to move in. When Asher returns later, he has his brother Sol (Tosin Cole) and new friend Naz Mehmet (Emaa Hussen) with him, and Stevie says she does not mind them staying, so they all become friends. Olly warns Stevie not to attend a party later but Naz says they should go anyway, and on the way there, Stevie meets Masood Ahmed (Nitin Ganatra), but assumes he is a suicide bomber. At the party, Asher poses as Stevie's new boyfriend to make Olly jealous. She gets drunk and badmouths Olly to a girl called Pippa (Roxanne McKee) but Pippa introduces Olly as her own boyfriend, so Stevie insults her, resulting in Pippa pushing Stevie. The four friends leave and Stevie meets Masood again and he offers her his coat because she is cold. Feeling humiliated by photos that have been posted on the internet from the party, Stevie worries her only chance to win Olly back has been ruined. She tells Naz she had an erotic dream about Masood and develops a crush on him. She tries to get work with Masood by flirting but is left embarrassed. She returns after being given tips from Naz, and Masood tells her they are short staffed and to come back the next day. Stevie thinks her flirting was successful so goes over the top and flashes her bra, so Naz ushers her away. On Stevie's birthday, Naz arranges a dinner party for Stevie. Stevie's mother calls, asking her to carry out an errand but not mentioning her birthday. Naz sees a birthday card from when Stevie was thirteen and Stevie says it is the last card she received from her family. Naz tells her to forget her family. When Sol falls out with both Naz and Asher, Stevie tries to help resolve the problems. She and Sol go to a club where Stevie bumps into Pippa and they are more friendly. The next day, they wake up in bed together and Stevie tries to hide Pippa from her housemates. Olly bursts in saying he will have to let the flat go as he needs his deposit, but Stevie asks for one more day. Pippa writes Stevie a cheque to cover it, says she is one of the sexiest girls she has ever met, and asks her to call her, before leaving. Stevie gives Olly the deposit but he reveals he has already given notice and Stevie will have to move out the next day. Stevie visits her brother Rupert's grave before returning to the flat and making a list of safety violations. When her landlady Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) arrives, Stevie begs to stay, and says she will contact the council about the violations, so Roxy agrees. Stevie then invites Olly over, and he hopes to rekindle their relationship. However, she ties him naked to a chair, then humiliates him by making him walk home in a dress. She tells Masood they will have tea one day and kisses him before running off. The friends then all reunite and Stevie remarks that she loves a happy ending, saying they are now a happy family. Creation, development and characterisation Stevie is one of four main characters from series two of EastEnders: E20, created by its team of thirteen writers. Amanda Fairbank- Hynes was cast in the role, on which she stated, \\"It all happened so quickly but I'm really excited to be working on EastEnders. It's an amazing group of people and they are great to work with.\\" Fairbank-Hynes attended five auditions for the part, and she found out she got the part two days before filming started. She stated that she was pleased when she found out as attending that many auditions‚Äîthe most she had auditioned for any part‚Äîmade her want the part more. The character was still being written and changed a lot during the audition process. The character and casting were announced on 28 July 2010. The show's producer, Deborah Sathe, said \\"I am [...] proud of what the writers have achieved. [They] have created four new faces for [Albert] Square and their reaction to Walford life is really exciting.\\" Stevie is the privately educated daughter of rich parents, who have abandoned her to go travelling. She is said to be clueless about real life, with her profile on the official E20 website describing her as generous, creative and unlucky in love, though she has a boyfriend. Although she is described as posh, Fairbank- Hynes said Stevie is not just like a posh girl in East London, but would be out of place anywhere as she is in her own world. Fairbank-Hynes opined that posh characters in Walford stand out and can bring comedy to the show. Stevie is very naive and, according to Fairbank-Hynes, \\"away with the fairies\\"‚Äîthe most naive person anyone could meet. However, writer Emer Kenny was worried that Stevie being \\"away with the fairies\\" would make her unrealistic, but said that Fairbank-Hynes made the character recognisable. Because of Stevie's naivety and her kind nature, people see this as an invitation to take advantage of her. Stevie does not understand why people are cruel to her because she sees the good in them and wants to look after them, be around people and mother them. Fairbank-Hynes commented, \\"Stevie's the type of person who thinks a stranger is a friend she hasn't met yet\\". However, Stevie is very forward, which can scare people away. She is also creative, empathetic and a complete daydreamer who lacks common sense but has bursts of assertiveness and intelligence, which can surprise people. Thompson said that Stevie has a good balance as she can be ditzy but also quite smart. Fairbank-Hynes identified with the character's mad outbursts, innocence and daydreaming, and also said Stevie is quirky, lovely and eccentric. Her daydreaming can lead people to believe she is a bimbo, but she is not. Stevie's relationship with Olly is complicated and he treats her badly, but she ignores his flaws and holds onto any nice thing he does, however small. When he ends their relationship, Stevie is heartbroken, alone and lost, and does not fit in. She invites Asher to stay and is surprised when he brings Sol and Naz as well, but because Stevie loves to make new friends, she reacts in a way most people would not in that situation. She builds relationships with them and they grow to love her eventually. Fairbank-Hynes commented: \\"Sol, Naz and Asher inform her about the real world and help her harden up just enough to survive in Albert Square!\\" Stevie starts to see her new friends as the family she always wanted, but it proves to be difficult as they all have family issues of their own. Stevie wants to look after her new friends, which confuses them. The actress described the four friends as an unlikely gang, and said her favourite scenes were when Stevie and Sol caused a blackout across Albert Square, as the two characters did not have much interaction before then. Thompson described Stevie as a \\"fish out of water\\", and Hussen said Stevie starts off being unappreciated, but eventually her friends see that she is important to them. Stevie falls for Masood quite early on and it plays out through the whole series. She believes she has met the man of her dreams, but her feelings are not reciprocated because of the way she is. Fairbank-Hynes said the storyline is interesting and funny. Stevie also sees Pippa as \\"the cold-hearted 'other woman'\\" who has stolen her boyfriend, but later discovers that she is \\"actually human too and not some evil goddess whose sole intention is to steal boyfriends!\\" McKee said that Pippa's role in the series is the drive Stevie's story forward and help her find her identity. In an interview with Last Broadcast the actress said that over the course of the series, Stevie becomes more streetwise and a better judge of character. Other appearances  Stevie is one of four characters who has an official profile on social networking site Twitter, where it is revealed that the character is living in Albert Square before the series starts, staying with her boyfriend Olly. Further posts show that he went out on their anniversary and she hoped to make the relationship work but he hinted that he would end it. Stevie also appears in additional video content on the official E20 website. In the first video, she performs a rap about Olly on the tube after leaving the party in episode 2. In another, Stevie and Naz have a picnic in the park, and Naz makes a video of Stevie, hoping to make Olly jealous, but Stevie ends up with cake on her face. The four friends play a drinking game in the caf√© in another video, and another scene features Stevie and Naz talking about kissing.

Naz is a main character in series 2, where she is joined by brothers Asher (Heshima Thompson) and Sol Levi (Tosin Cole), and Stevie Dickinson (Amanda Fairbank- Hynes). Naz is torn between two worlds: her traditional Muslim family life and modern London life. She loves and respects her family but also loves to party. She falls in love with Sol despite being engaged to Ekin Beg (Hemi Yeroham) by arrangement. This leads to Naz and Sol falling out and she sleeps with Asher, but eventually reunites with Sol. She is described as confident, strong, fiery and a troublemaker. Hussen briefly reprised the role in series 3. Storylines Naz arrives in Walford having bought a fake ID from Fatboy (Ricky Norwood), but she is angry that the photo looks nothing like her and the age is too high, so she steals her money back from him. He chases after her but she is rescued by Sol Levi (Tosin Cole). She removes her makeup and changes into plain clothes to return home but hears her father (Nayeef Rashed) shouting so leaves. She meets Sol and his older brother Asher (Heshima Thompson), and goes with them to Stevie Dickinson's (Amanda Fairbank-Hynes) flat where Stevie allows them to stay. Naz and Sol begin to bond, and she kisses him to avoid being seen by Ekin Beg (Hemi Yeroham). However, Ekin later finds her and takes her to her parents' house where it is revealed that Naz and Ekin are to be married. Naz and Sol almost kiss twice but are interrupted both times, the second time by the arrival of Ekin, who tells Naz's friends they are engaged. Naz and Sol argue and she says she is not engaged to Ekin but then says she is, leaving Sol angry. She then discovers it is Stevie's birthday and arranges a surprise dinner party for her. Stevie tells her that Sol likes her and she should kiss him, but he insults her because Ekin has inadvertently led him to believe Asher and Naz are seeing each other. Naz and Asher go clubbing and get drunk and high on drugs, and though Sol sends her an apologetic text message, Asher deletes it before Naz sees it. Naz and Asher end up having sex, but he abandons her afterwards and Sol finds her and apologises. They reconcile but she feels guilty. The next day they wake up after spending the night in the same bed, and Naz later watches Sol at dance rehearsals. Asher returns a necklace to Naz, and Sol sees this. He confronts her about it and she reveals she had a one-night stand with Asher but it meant nothing to her. She insists she did not receive Sol's text message but he is still angry. In an attempt to get Naz and Sol to reconcile again, Stevie pretends to swallow the key to the flat's front door, leaving them trapped. Naz reveals she is going to Turkey to meet Ekin's family and Sol angrily says she can stay there. When left alone, they get close again, but Asher interrupts them when he returns. Stevie drops the key revealing she did not swallow it and Sol thinks Naz was in on the plan so he sarcastically tells her to enjoy Turkey before leaving. She returns home and prepares to leave for Turkey but her father discovers she has escaped through a window. She returns to the flat but her father and Ekin come after her and try to take her back home. Sol stops the car and Naz gets out and they kiss. Later at the dance- off, she and her father talk and he finally accepts her choice of boyfriend. In series 3, Naz and Sol are seen briefly together, and they are still a couple. Creation, development and characterisation Naz is one of four main characters from series two of EastEnders: E20, created by its team of thirteen writers, along with Asher, Sol and Stevie. Newcomer Emaa Hussen was cast in the role, and said: \\"It's a really exciting place to start my career. I'm from East London and a big fan of EastEnders, which is one of the reasons I wanted to do the show.\\" Hussen said she was offered the part as the producers saw something \\"authentic and real\\" in her and that she could play the character how they wanted, and said she is similar to the character in some ways, adding that she enjoyed playing a strong character and felt like Naz as soon as she got into costume. The character and casting were announced on 28 July 2010. The show's producer, Deborah Sathe, said \\"I am [...] proud of what the writers have achieved. [They] have created four new faces for [Albert] Square and their reaction to Walford life is really exciting.\\" The character, of Turkish descent, is described as being \\"torn between two worlds\\", which Hussen explained are her traditional family life and modern London life. Naz is a family girl who has reached a point in her life where she wants to have fun, but is also a daddy's girl, the apple of her father's eye. He sees her as a perfect student. She has a good relationship with her parents and is respectful of them, doing what they want, even though they do not know her very well. She loves her family but they do not understand her or what she wants. Hussen opined that Naz would be a good girl if her family did understand her more. What Naz wants is to be like everyone around her and to be able to pick her own boyfriend, but being from a Muslim family means she is unable to. She tries to keep each side of her life secret from the other, but more of each side is seen as the series goes on, and they eventually meet, leading to bad consequences. Hussen opined that this is a common real-life situation that is rarely portrayed on television, so girls would be able relate to the character. Naz likes to make everyone happy but ultimately is more likely to think about her own happiness; she likes to get her own way. Naz believes that her new friends can take her away from her home life. She falls in love with Sol, which Hussen said leads to Naz having to make a difficult decision as Sol is \\"the wrong person\\". Naz turns out to be not as strong as first expected, and she puts up a wall. Hussen said that there is something about Sol that attracts her, and as she is stronger than he is, she sees it as taking him in and teaching him. Sol falls for Naz very quickly, and Cole said they have never met people like each other before. Naz is a party girl who loves to have fun, but causes trouble and drama, such as when her argument with Fatboy in episode 1 leads to a fight between the main characters of series 1 and 2. Hussen said that this was her favourite scene to film. Not everyone gets on with Naz straight away. She is confident and fiery, she has a strong power and people listen to what she has to say. Emer Kenny, who played Zsa Zsa Carter in series 1 of EastEnders: E20 and was one of the writers, introducing the characters in the first episode, said that although Naz was her favourite character to write for, she found it a challenge as she is funny but not a \\"clown\\" like Fatboy. Kenny compared Naz to Zsa Zsa, saying she is clever but cool, feisty, sassy and able to outwit Fatboy. Kenny also admired the character's costume and makeup, saying she looked perfect and was exactly as she imagined her to look. Other appearances Naz is one of four characters from series 2 who has an official profile on social networking site Twitter, along with Stevie, Stevie's boyfriend Olly Manthrope-Hall (Joshua McGuire) and Fatboy, where it is revealed that the character works in a kebab shop during the summer holiday. Further posts on Twitter allude to the storyline running up to the start of the series, such as Naz buying the fake ID from Fatboy. Naz also appears in extra video content on the E20 website. In one video, she attempts to take a photo of herself to use on her fake ID. In another, Stevie and Naz have a picnic in the park, and Naz makes a video of Stevie, hoping to make Olly jealous, but Stevie ends up with cake on her face. In another video, the four friends play a drinking game in the caf√©. Another scene features Stevie and Naz talking about kissing, and another features a nightmare scenario of her and Ekin getting married in a Laz Vegas wedding chapel.

Bernard Shea Rowing Center at Princeton University The C. Bernard Shea Rowing Center is the boathouse for the Princeton University rowing programs. Located on Lake Carnegie in Princeton, New Jersey, the center consists of the Class of 1887 Boathouse and the Richard Ottesen Prentke ‚Äò67 Training Center. The Shea Center was dedicated on October 7, 2000.  History  Rowing began at Princeton in 1870 with a half-dozen undergraduates and two boats, which the students taught themselves to row on the Delaware and Raritan Canal.Leitch, Alexander (1978). A Princeton Companion. Princeton University Press. By 1874, the Princeton Boating Club had been formed and had obtained a wood-framed boathouse on the canal. But by 1884, the canal had become so busy with steam- powered boat traffic that rowing was forced to cease. Early in the 20th century, former coxswain Howard Russell Butler convinced Andrew Carnegie to create a lake at Princeton. When some lakeside property owners demanded to sell their entire farms, Carnegie balked at providing full financing, Butler and a group of eleven other alumni generously stepped in and purchased over a hundred acres of land, 89 of which were then given to the University. Other alumni gave hundreds of acres of land to the University at the same time. The lake was finally completed in 1906.Rivinus, Willis (2005). Rowing at Princeton. Princeton University Rowing Association. With a fine body of water on which to compete, rowing began again in 1911. In 1913, the Class of 1887 Boathouse was donated to the University on the occasion of the 25th reunion of the Class; they had been the last class to row on the Canal. The structure initially accommodated only 3 full eights of heavyweight oarsmen. As Princeton added new rowing programs, the building housed heavyweight, lightweight, women‚Äôs and lightweight women‚Äôs crew programs. There were a number of piecemeal modifications over the years to accommodate the additional athletes, leaving a building that was maze-like and confusing. By 1997, the boathouse was serving more than 160 athletes on a daily basis, and was packed beyond overflowing. Additionally, the building was falling into disrepair. Indeed, a 1996 meeting of the Princeton University Rowing Association (PURA) was punctuated by a window falling out.Princeton Rowing Notes, winter 2000 Subsequent to this meeting, PURA president Dick Prentke ‚Äò67 initiated the effort to work with University to pursue a full-scale renovation and addition. PURA turned to architect and former lightweight rower Jeff Peterson ‚Äô84 to explore initial concepts for the project. Peterson's firm at that time, Architectural Resources Cambridge, was eventually hired to design the project. After the project, Peterson started Peterson Architects, a firm that focuses primarily on boathouses. PURA raised more than $8 million from over 1200 donors for the project, including a $4 million gift by Irene C. Shea in memory of her husband C. Bernard Shea ‚Äò1916. Mr. Shea had been a student when the 1887 Boathouse opened and was an avid fan of rowing and all things Princeton.\\"Dedication Set For Rowing Center\\", Princeton Weekly Bulletin, October 2, 2000. Retrieved on 2010-11-7. Construction commenced in June 1999. Crews were able to partially occupy the 1887 Boathouse for boat storage in the spring of 2000. The project was completed in time for full occupancy in the fall of 2000. An unusually heavy rainfall in April 2007 caused the water level in Lake Carnegie to rise several feet, flooding Shea Rowing Center and suspending activities for several days.Krauss, Sam. \\"Storm Forces University to Curtail Operations\\",The Daily Princetonian, April 17, 2007. Retrieved on 2010-11-7. After the flood, the University engaged Peterson Architects to repair the facility and to mitigate potential damage from future floods.  Design  The C. Bernard Shea Rowing Center serves as a gateway to the Princeton Campus, the first visible buildings when approaching from the east. The center consists of the original Class of 1887 Boathouse (22,000 s.f.) and the Richard Ottesen Prentke Training Center (13,500 s.f.). To achieve architectural consistency, the newer Prentke Center reiterates the bay spacing, hipped roofs, and tripartite window configurations of the original building. The tower of the 1887 Boathouse is the center's entry and focal point. On its second floor, it features a double-height sky-lit space with mahogany flooring, benches and wainscoting. A gallery extending to the west features historical photographs, overlooks the lake and provides access to shower and locker facilities. The gallery arrives at a grand open-timbered club room with lounge seating, trophy cases, and video facilities. The Prentke Center includes two bays for small boats, and a moving-water rowing tank. In the tank, the broadly arched window evokes the arches of the Washington Street Bridge. The upper level contains three large workout spaces framed with heavy timber trusses. These rooms are finished with mahogany wainscot and athletic rubber flooring.Rivinus, Willis (2005). Rowing at Princeton. Princeton University Rowing Association.

It is traversed by Edgwarebury Brook and contains traces of a planned railway viaduct and embankment. This was part of a planned extension of the Northern line from Edgware to Bushey,Edgwarebury Park, London Gardens Online which was cancelled when the introduction of the Green Belt after the Second World War led to the cancellation of the developments which the railway was to serve. Part of the site is the Environment Agency's Edgwarebury Park Flood Storage Area. The reserve is typical unimproved London Clay grassland. Damp, herb rich areas have uncommon plants characteristic of old meadows such as great burnet, sneezewort and devil's bit scabious. The brook is lined by sedges and water-cress, while breeding birds include yellowhammer and spotted flycatcher. The reserve adjoins Edgwarebury Park. It is private land, but is crossed by a public footpath from Edgware Way which starts just west of the junction with Spur Road.

Sol is a main character in series 2, where he is joined by his older brother Asher Levi (Heshima Thompson) and their new friends Naz Mehmet (Emaa Hussen) and Stevie Dickinson (Amanda Fairbank-Hynes). Sol is described as loyal, shy, thoughtful and reserved. He is dependent on his brother, who has looked after him for most of this life. Throughout the series, he has a romance with Naz but it is threatened by his bad temper, falls out but later reunites with his brother, and performs a solo dance routine in the finale. Tosin will reprise the role in series 3. Storylines Sol arrives in Walford with his brother Asher Levi (Heshima Thompson) after their mother Caroline (Sandra Yaw) throws them out of their home. Sol helps Naz Mehmet (Emaa Hussen) in an argument with Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) and is punched in the face by Leon Small (Sam Attwater). Sol and Asher attend a dance audition for Skolla (Tony Adigun) but Sol messes up. They then move into Stevie Dickinson's (Amanda Fairbank-Hynes) flat with Naz. They attend a party where several people ask Sol for drugs, leaving him annoyed. Naz sells them fake drugs, but when they complain, Sol gives their money back and they leave. Back in Walford, Naz kisses Sol to avoid being seen by Ekin Beg (Hemi Yeroham). Sol and Naz grow closer when she watches him do his dance routine, and they almost kiss twice but are interrupted both times, the second time by the arrival of Ekin who reveals he and Naz are engaged. Sol then argues with Naz about Ekin. He and Asher attend callbacks for the dance group but Skolla says Sol is too slow and gets him to perform solo, but Sol is put off but the audience and leaves. Asher later tells him he is a better dancer and the dance crew is their future, but Sol says it is Asher's dream and he just wants to go home to his mother. After Asher tells Ekin to back off from Naz, Ekin asks Sol to tell Asher he is not Naz's boyfriend, leading Sol to believe that Naz and Asher are seeing each other. Sol insults Naz and Asher who leave and go clubbing. Sol sends an apology via text message, and Stevie encourages him to find her. When he does, she is drunk. They reconcile but he is unaware that Naz and Asher have had sex. Sol and Naz spend the night together but at later dance rehearsals, Asher gives Naz her necklace back, and Sol sees this. He confronts Naz about it and she reveals she had a one-night stand with Asher but it meant nothing to her. Sol punches Asher, saying his brother has betrayed him, and a fight breaks out, but is broken up by Skolla and the other dancers. Skolla tells Sol and Asher they are both out of the group and reveals that Asher bought Sol's place. Sol goes back home to his mother but a neighbour tells him she has been taken away. Back in Walford, Naz insists she did not receive Sol's text message but he is still angry. Stevie attempts to get them to reconcile by locking them in the flat and pretending to swallow the key, but Naz reveals she is going to Turkey to meet Ekin's family and Sol says she can stay there. Sol and Naz get close again but Asher interrupts them when he returns drunk. Stevie drops the key revealing she did not swallow it and Sol thinks Naz was in on the plan so he tells her to enjoy Turkey before leaving. Asher finds Sol with their mother in hospital, and tells Sol he is better off with him than their mother as she is schizophrenic and has stabbed Asher. Sol says Asher is the problem and leaves. Asher finds him and apologises for Naz and says she did not get Sol's text message because he deleted it, and tells Sol that Naz loves him and he should do something about it. Sol returns to Walford again as Naz is leaving, and stops Ekin's car. Naz gets out and they kiss. Asher tells him he can dance at the dance- off, but when his name is called, he is unsure and calls for Asher, saying he needs him. Asher tells him he can do it on his own. Everyone cheers him after his routine and he is called one of the best dancers. In series 3, Naz and Sol are seen briefly together, and they are still a couple. Creation, development and characterisation Sol is one of four main characters from series two of EastEnders: E20, created by its team of thirteen writers, along with Asher, Stevie and Naz. Tosin Cole was cast in the role, and said, \\"It's a privilege to work on something so big but so different. Everyone is fantastic to work with. I'm really excited.\\" He said that he found it exciting and weird to work with the EastEnders cast, but they made him feel comfortable. However, he admitted to feeling nervous about having to dance in front of professional dance group Flawless in the series finale, saying that learning to dance was \\"very, very, very stressful.\\" The character and casting were announced on 28 July 2010. The show's producer, Deborah Sathe, said \\"I am [...] proud of what the writers have achieved. [They] have created four new faces for [Albert] Square and their reaction to Walford life is really exciting.\\" Sol is Asher's younger brother, and Asher has provided for him most of his life. Asher has been a father figure to Sol since a young age, and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. Sol is loyal to his brother, but depends on him so much that he finds it difficult to function without him. Sol likes his family to be together, but they are fractured due to Asher being a troublemaker and their mother being mentally unstable and Sol wants to reunite them. Sol's dependence on Asher also means he finds it difficult to establish his own identity. Asher is willing to put himself out to secure Sol's success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch so Sol can get a place in the dance group, and has done things so that Sol would not have to do them himself. Thompson opined that Asher is not necessarily the best role model for Sol, but is a good brother even though the mistakes he makes override the good things he has done for Sol. Cole said that Sol is not a troublemaker but he gets into trouble without meaning to as trouble comes to him. Although he does not bring attention to himself, he has a bad temper and hides his feelings with violence. He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. Sol does not understand or think about what he is doing when he loses his temper. Cole also said that trust is an issue with Sol throughout the series. Sol quickly falls for Naz when they meet, but his anger threatens their relationship. Sol has never met a girl like Naz before, and Cole said Naz probably has not met boys like Sol before either. Hussen said that there is something about Sol that attracts Naz. She is stronger than he is so Naz likes to take him in and teach him things. Cole explained that Sol is attracted to Naz because she is different from other girls and they are complete opposites. and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. One of Cole's first scenes to film was a kiss between Sol and Naz. Cole found it tough and awkward as the actors had only just met, and would have preferred it to be filmed later on, but said that the scene was awkward anyway so he did not have to act much for it. Sol has also been described as shy, caring, sweet, thoughtful, soft, easily hurt and reserved. Other appearances Sol also appears in extra video content on the E20 website. In one, he and Asher argue during filming of an advert for \\"SmasherDance\\", as Sol is more interested in getting food. The full SmasherDance advert is also on YouTube. In another video, the four friends play a drinking game in the caf√© but Sol loses and ends up being sick from too much drink. In another video he calls his mother and leaves a message saying he misses her and is worried about her.

It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1983. The historic district stretches from River Drive along the Mississippi River up a bluff to East Ninth Street, which is near the top of the hill. Description Nathan Rambo House The historic district is made up of fourteen houses on the southern end of Bridge Avenue. with The street itself rises steeply to the north from River Drive. It is located along the east side of a ravine that separates it from the St. Katherine's Historic District on the west. To the north and west is the LeClaire Reserve, a largely residential area built on property that had belonged to city founder Antoine LeClaire. A residential neighborhood to the east that dates from the early 20th Century includes the Prospect Park Historic District. The houses along this section of Bridge Avenue were largely built from the 1870s to 1910. The oldest house, however, was built in 1860. Ten of the houses are on the west side of the street and four are on the east side, which also includes the larger property of the Ambrose Fulton House. All but two of the houses are of frame construction. The two noncontributing elements in the district are a modern apartment building (730 Bridge) and a parking lot located at the foot of Bridge Avenue and Oneida Street. Architecture John Forrest House The most prominent of the residences was built by Ambrose Fulton, who was significant to Davenport's early settlement and its industrial history. He was an early and aggressive promoter of the new town. Fulton was involved in multiple industries including flour mills, railroads, river commerce, land speculation, and retail commerce. Of the four oldest houses in the district, three are Italianate, including the Fulton House, and one is Second Empire. Three of the four houses feature quoined corners similar to that of the Fulton residence even though they are built of wood. Quoining is rare in Davenport's residential architecture and its noticeable incidence here suggest others were emulating Fulton.Svendsen, 7.10 Besides Fulton, three other prominent members of the Davenport community built houses on Bridge Avenue. John B. Carmichael dealt in books, stationary, and wallpaper; Josiah Dow owned a grain mill; and John Forrest was a local politician and commercial developer. Forrest is also responsible for the Forrest Block downtown. Josiah's wife Maggie built a duplex on Bridge Avenue after her husband's death. Nine of the more significant houses include: John B. Carmichael House Cassius D. Hayward House *Herman Andresen House (1885) 732 Bridge Avenue. The two-story frame residence features a bellcast mansard roof, and a molded cornice on the gable end. *John B. Carmichael House (1885) 820 Bridge Avenue. The two-story, three bay, front gable frame house possesses Italianate characteristics that are found in the curved window heads and false wood quoining that is designed to look like masonry. *Josiah Dow House (1874) 908 Bridge Avenue. The Second Empire frame house is a 2¬Ω-story structure with a mansard roof, rectangular plan and an addition that was added to the back of the house. *Maggie Dow House (1901) 815-815¬Ω Bridge Avenue. A two-story double house with a high hipped roof in the Georgian Revival style. *John Forrest House (1875) 718 Bridge Avenue. A two-story, front gable house with a cross gable and side porch in a combination Greek Revival and Italianate styles. *A.C. Fulton House (1871) 1206 East River Drive. The house is a noteworthy example of vernacular domestic architecture that is based on the Italianate style. What makes the house unique in Davenport is that its side-gable form and symmetrical, five-bay main facade are derived from a vernacular Greek Revival style while the cornice, quoined corners, and window treatments follow the Italianate style. While the combination of these two styles in a single house is not unusual in the city, the form and mass are generally rendered in the Italianate while the decorative elements are Greek Revival. The columned porch adds to the house's eclecticism. *Cassius D. Hayward House (1902) 812 Bridge Avenue. The Georgian Revival residence is a 2¬Ω-story structure that follows an irregular plan and is capped by a hipped roof with dormers and projecting gables. *W.J. Hayward House (1880) 802 Bridge Avenue. The two-story house follows an L-plan and features a three-bay symmetrical facade and a full-width porch. The Italianate house is capped with a hipped roof. *Nathan Rambo House (1860) 1203 E. 9th Street. The two-story brick residence is a fine example of the \\"Cube-Form\\" Italianate house found in Davenport. It features an Eastlake-style entrance porch.

The London Penny Post was a premier postal system whose function was to deliver mail within London and its immediate suburbs for the modest sum of one penny. The Penny Post was established in 1680 by William Dockwra and his business partner, Robert Murray. Dockwra was a merchant and a member of the Armourer and Brasiers Livery Company and was appointed a Customs Under-Searcher for the Port of London in 1663. Murray would later become clerk in the excise office of the Penny Post. The London Penny Post mail service was launched with weeks of publicity preceding it on 27 March 1680. The new London Penny Post provided the city of London with a much needed intra-city mail delivery system. The new Penny Post was influential in establishing a model system and pattern for the various Provincial English Penny Posts in the years that followed. It was the first postal system to use hand-stamps to postmark the mail to indicate the place and time of the mailing and that its postage had been prepaid. The success of the Penny Post would also threaten the interests of the Duke of York who profited directly from the existing general post office. It also compromised the business interests of porters and private couriers. The Penny Post was also involved in publishing various criticisms towards the British monarchy, the Duke of York in particular, which ultimately led to the take over of the Penny Post by crown authorities. The earliest known Penny Post postmark is dated 13 December 1680 and is considered by some to be the world's first postage 'stamp'. Mail services in London, 1680 Prior to the advent of the London Penny Post there was only one General Letter Office in London and Westminster to receive and deliver the mail that was bound for destinations outside London proper, but there was no system or provision for the general distribution of letters or parcels within the city of London itself. Dockwra and Murray's Penny Post provided such a service. The new Penny Post service proved very useful to London's merchants and to other businesses, and very popular among the citizenry of London, who hitherto had to pay more expensive rates to private couriers and porters to deliver mail or small packages within the city. With the growth of trade and the increase in the population of London (which had about half a million people at that time), there was an ever-increasing demand for a mail system that would serve London and its suburbs. With its cheap flat postage-rate of one penny, the Penny Post quickly became a commercial success. Premier postal system Dockwra plaque in Lime Street, London Several Penny Post offices were established at various points within London where letters that were collected from drop-boxes about the city were sorted and sent out for delivery. Dockwra, Murrey and their partners divided London between Westminster and Blackwell and between Hackney and Lambeth into seven districts with a sorting office for each. They established a Head Office that was set up in the home of Dockwra himself who was living in a mansion on Lime Street that was formerly owned by Sir Robert Abdy. Dockwra established hourly collections, with a maximum of ten deliveries daily for London and a minimum of six deliveries for the various London suburbs, such as Hackney and Islington. However Robert Murray was arrested in May 1680, along with another associate of the Penny Post, George Cowdron, for distributing by means of the Penny Post what was considered to be seditious material criticising the Duke of York (afterwards James II). This left Dockwra to manage the Penny Post and as such credit is roundly given to him for its designs and further improvements as the Penny Post at that point having only been in operation for a couple of months was still in its developmental stages. Within two years the Penny Post had grown to such proportions that approximately four to five hundred receiving-houses and wall-boxes had been established at various locations about the city of London, however some of the accounts vary. E.g. in Robert Seymour's Survey of London and Westminster, published in 1735, he puts the number of receiving houses at over 600. Dockwra's Penny Post delivered letters and packets weighing up to one pound and delivery was guaranteed within four hours, each letter being marked with a heart shaped time stamp indicating the time an item was dropped off for delivery. Because the new postal service was affordable to the general public with its inexpensive flat rate of one penny it became an almost instant success and became the predecessor of the postal systems that later emerged and are still in use today in Great Britain and elsewhere today. To announce the new Penny Post's inter-city mail services public notices were published in several local newspapers (figure 1) and notices and posters were also printed and circulated. Postmarks figure 2 Lime St. Postmark & heart-shaped Time-stamps figure 3 Postmark used in 1681 When mail was submitted for delivery by the Penny Post the postage rate of one penny was charged and a hand-stamped postmark and time-stamp were applied to the mailed item confirming that its postage had been paid. The triangular postmarks used by Dockwra's Penny Post account for his fame among postal historians. Four types of triangular postmarks were used to frank mail, (figure 4) but of the few that survive most are in museum archives, and only four are known to be in the hands of private collectors. The triangle-shaped postmark is considered by some historians and philatelists as the world's first postage stamp. Each Penny Post office had its own initial letter. The Penny Post also employed heart-shaped time stamps, one with the abbreviation 'Mor.' designating a morning mailing and one with 'Af.' indicating an afternoon mailing, along with the number of the hour i.e. a numeral '4' indicating a 4 O'clock mailing. (figure 2) The triangle postmarks used on letters in 1680 differ somewhat from later examples. The 1680 postmarks are larger, with the shortest side to the triangle at the base. The postmarks on mailings in 1681 have triangles whose longest side is situated at the base and with the word PAID inscribed upside-down within the triangle. (figure 3) There also exist examples of postmarks where the word paid is spelled as PAYD. The initial letter was located within the triangle; 'L' for the London office, 'W' for Westminster, 'S' for the Saint Paul office, however there is speculation that the 'L' marking may have indicated a mailing from the office in Dockwra's home on Lime St. thumb650pxcentrefigure 4 ~ Postmarks used by the London Penny Post ~ In these examples the letters in the centre identified the office the mailed item was sent from. L = Lime Street and W = Westminster. In the original Dockwra triangular postmarks the words PENNY was always positioned on the left side, POST on the right side and PAID at the bottom, top outwards. Take over of Penny Post When the Penny Post was first launched in 1680 there was much opposition to the new service. Its success took business from the General Post office, so much so that by 1682 a civil action was brought against Dockwra for having a monopoly on the postal services of the state. There were many couriers and porters who also regarded the Penny Post as a threat to the delivery services they offered and who sometimes resorted to assaulting the Post's messengers, tearing down advertisements and committing other acts of violence. There was also concern about the Whig party which was supporting the Penny Post and using it to distribute anti-Catholic and seditious newsletters in an attempt to exclude James II, Duke of York, from the succession to the throne on the grounds that he was Catholic. The Protestants denounced the concern as a design of the Duke of York and the Popish party. As a result, the Penny Post was taken over by the Crown authorities in that year and became part of the existing General Post Office. From that point on the postal rates gradually increased. Before the emergence of the Penny Post the profits of the existing General Post Office were assigned by Parliament in 1663 to the Duke of York, who now had similar designs on Dockwra's lucrative Penny Post. As the Penny Post proved to be a great success and a potential new source of constant revenue the English government and the Duke of York at the time fined Dockwra ¬£100 for contempt, claiming it infringed the monopoly of the General Post Office, and took control of the Penny Post's operations in 1682, bringing that enterprise to an end. Less than a month later the London Penny Post was made a branch of the General Post Office. For compensation of his losses Dockwra obtained a pension of ¬£500 a year after the Revolution of 1688. Over the years successive governments used the profits from the General Post Office and the London Penny Post as revenue. Much of the revenue that was being generated by the Penny Post was used to finance the various and almost continuous wars with France. Because the demands of the wars were so great, each time more money was needed to finance them the cost of postage was increased dramatically. This led to increasing public dissatisfaction and criticism of the high postage rates. At one point to send a letter across London the rates were as much as a day's wages for many. This went on for more than 100 years, and as a result of the mounting public complaints, a Committee of Enquiry was finally set up in 1835. Because of the excesses and indiscretions of the postal authorities and the much-needed reforms, Rowland Hill published a pamphlet entitled Post Office Reform, which led to various reforms and the introduction of the first postage stamp, the Penny Black. Because of its simplicity and ease of use the postage stamp brought reform to the post office, much like that of William Dockwra when his hand stamp struck the first letter delivered by the London Penny Post.

Daronch was born to immigrants and lived his entire life in Brazil where he was known to have had a love for football and riding. He became a dedicated altar server following the reception of his First Communion and often accompanied the priest Blessed Manuel G√≥mez Gonz√°lez on his long missions of evangelization. The pair were murdered in 1924 on one such mission after revolutionaries became outraged with Manuel's active apostolate in their area. The pair's beatification process opened in Brazil in the late 1990s and culminated on 21 October 2007 with their beatification held in Brazil. Daronch was made the co-patron for WYD 2013 and in 2012 was made the patron for the Diocese of Frederico Westphalen. Life Ad√≠lio Daronch was born in Brazil in Rio Grande do Sul on 25 October 1908 as the third of eight children born to the immigrants Pietro Daronch (d. 5.5.1923) and Giuditta Segabinazzi (2.2.1884‚Äì23.3.1932). His father was an immigrant from Agordo in the Belluno province of Italy who settled in Brazil in 1890. His mother was also an immigrant. In 1911 the Daronch's moved to Passo Fundo and then again in 1913 to Nonoai. He was baptized on 1 November. His siblings were (in order): * Herminia * Ab√≠lio * Zolmira * Carmelinda * Annita * Jo√£o * Vilma His sister Zolmira recounted that Daronch loved football and was a well-liked child. His sister Zolmira was born after the Daronch's moved to Passo Fundo while his siblings Carmelinda to Vilma were all born after the Daronch's next relocation. His Italian paternal grandparents were Sebastiano Da Ronch (b. 1829) and Francesca Schena (b. 1838) and his paternal uncles (in order) were Luigi and Vincenzo as well as his aunt Giovanna Maria; his father was the last-born to his grandparents. The Daronch's arrived in Rio de Janeiro from Genoa on the ship \\"Europa\\" on 1 December 1890 and his father began work as an apprentice shoemaker. His maternal grandparents were Felippe and Praxedes Girardi. His parents married on 15 January 1905 at a wedding that the Pallottine priest Guido Spiesbenger oversaw. His father was later murdered in 1923. He became a student at a school that the priest Blessed Manuel G√≥mez Gonz√°lez managed and Daronch also accompanied the priest on his visits to the Kaingang Indians as part of his work in the missions. He served as an altar server after he made his First Communion (1917 or 1918) at which point he began serving Mass for Father Manuel. He and G√≥mez Gonz√°lez were shot and killed on one such trip after revolutionaries attacked the pair. The Bishop of Santa Maria asked Manuel in 1924 to go to the Teutonic colonies in the forest in the south so Manuel decided to take Daronch with him; the two set off on this mission on 2 March around Easter. The pair stopped in Palmeria to administer the sacraments where Manuel exhorted the local revolutionaries to practice mutual respect and forgiveness. But the extremists took a strong dislike to this and grew incensed when Manuel provided a Christian burial for their victims, and plotted to kill them for this. On 20 May 1924 the pair stopped in Braga (where some soldiers were stationed) to ask for directions, where Ad√≠lio Daronch attended Manuel's final Mass, in a ruined chapel. The locals warned the two not to go into the forest where they would be at risk. But they proceeded and were ambushed in the morning of 21 May (and ordered off their mules) and were taken into a remote area in the forest before being bound to separate trees and shot dead. Their remains were discovered on 25 May and were buried; they were exhumed and relocated to the parish church in Nonoai in 1964. The people placed a monument on their place of death. Beatification The beatification cause opened on 29 March 1996 under Pope John Paul II after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the nihil obstat and titled Daronch as a Servant of God; the cause was joined to that of Father Manuel. The diocesan process was held from 1996 to 1997 with the C.C.S. validating the investigation on 4 December 1998. The postulation sent the Positio to the C.C.S. for assessment in 2001 at which point historians met and approved the dossier on 13 February 2001; theologians approved it as well on 26 September 2006 as did the C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members that 21 November. Daronch and Manuel's beatification received papal confirmation from Pope Benedict XVI a month later on 16 December after the pope confirmed that the pair were killed in odium fidei (in hatred of the faith). Their beatification was celebrated in Rio Grande do Sul on 21 October 2007 with Cardinal Jos√© Saraiva Martins presiding over the celebration on the pope's behalf. The current postulator for this cause is Dr. Paolo Vilotta. =Patronage= In mid-2012 Ad√≠lio Daronch was announced as a co-patron for WYD 2013. On 21 September 2012 the Frederico Westphalen diocese announced that Daronch and Father Manuel were the newest patrons for the diocese after the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments confirmed the request (lodged on 10 June 2012) in a decree on 14 September. The apostolic nuncio Giovanni d'Aniello received the news of this confirmation before likewise informing the diocesan bishop of this.

Benches, statues and vestments were donated, a harmonium was bought. The blessing of the church was done by a priest from Beringhausen on 15 October 1907 who dedicated it to St. Markus. In 1947/48 an extension was built up which is covered by a vestry. When the fl√®che fell into a state of dilapidation in 1956, a new steeple was erected. Further renovations took place from 1972 to 1984. Since the mid-50s, the patron saint of the Church is called Maria von der Immerw√§hrenden Hilfe.

He was the second son of Lajb Pivnik, a tailor, and Feigel Pivnik. As a Jewish family, the Pivniks were forced to live in the Kamionka Ghetto in Bƒôdzin from early 1943, and on 6 August 1943 the family were deported to Auschwitz II-Birkenau. His parents, younger sister Chana and younger brothers Meir, Wolf and Josef, were murdered on arrival. His older sister Handel survived for a brief period before she was sent to be gassed. Pivnik was registered in the camp and tattooed with prisoner number 135913.Archiwum PMAB ‚Äì Auschwitz Museum Archives L.dz. I-Arch-i-/4800-03/08 After a period of approximately two weeks in the 'Quarantine' area of Birkenau, he was assigned to the Rampkommando where he worked unloading newly arrived trains after the prisoners had been taken away for entry to the camp or gassing. This gave him access to food and valuables from prisoners luggage and he was able to use this to keep himself fed and to bribe Kapos, prisoner-overseers and trusties. On 27 December 1943, Pivnik was admitted to the prisoner infirmary in the Quarantine area KL Auschwitz II- Birkenau, B IIa, Block 9, with suspected typhus. He says that he survived several 'selections' and on 11 January 1944 was admitted to the main prisoners' hospital at KL-Auschwitz II-Birkenau B IIf. Following his recovery from typhus, Pivnik was selected for a work detail to go to KL Auschwitz III/F√ºrstengrube, a coal mine where he was assigned to the construction detail and appointed as a Vorarbeiter or overseer. He says that during his period at Auschwitz, he came to know both Otto Moll and Josef Mengele by sight. On 19 January 1945 the camp at F√ºrstengrube was evacuated in the face of the advancing Red Army and prisoners who were fit enough to move were, initially, marched to a railhead at Gleiwitz. Many of those who were not fit were shot by SS guards led by SS-Oberscharf√ºhrer Max Schmidt.Hoch, Gerhard Von Auschwitz nach Holstein: die J√ºdischen H√§ftlingen von F√ºrstengrube D√∂lling und Galitz Verlag, Hamburg (1998). After a nine-day rail journey in which the prisoners were given no additional rations, Pivnik's group arrived at KL Dora-Mittelbau on 28 January 1945. He spent the next three months on construction work before he ‚Äì together with approximately 200 other former F√ºrstengrube prisoners ‚Äì were evacuated by barge along the River Elbe to Holstein in northern Germany. In Holstein, the prisoners were assigned to farm labour, with Pivnik himself sent to work at Schmidt's parents' farm at Neuglasau, Segeberg, Schleswig- Holstein. At the beginning of May 1945, Pivnik and other former F√ºrstengrube prisoners, were marched to the port of Neustadt from where they were loaded, on 3 May 1945, aboard the former German cruise ship Cap Arcona which was being used as a prison ship for concentration camp inmates along with the Thielbek, Athen and Deutschland. Within hours of Pivnik boarding, the flotilla was attacked by fighter-bombers of the Royal Air Force and both Cap Arcona and Thielbek were set on fire and sunk. As one of the last to board, Pivnik was on an upper deck and able to jump from the ship and eventually swim ashore. Out of approximately 7,000 prisoners on board the two ships, no more than 500 survived.Lange, Wilhelm Cap Arcona: Das tragische Ende der KZ-H√§ftlings-Flotte am 3. Mai 1945 Helmut Kaun, Eutin (1992).

Minor league career Morrissey was a graduate of College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts. He began his professional career in 1926 with the Hartford Senators of the Eastern League, where he played in 44 games and had a batting average of .272 and three home runs. He split the 1927 season with the Scottdale Scotties of the Middle Atlantic League and Hartford. He hit .408 with the Scotties in 26 games while hitting .261 with Hartford. Morrissey missed two years of baseball before reappearing with the Evansville, Indiana team in the Illinois‚ÄìIndiana‚ÄìIowa League. With Evansville, his batting average was .321, and his teammates included future major leaguers Tommy Bridges, Pete Fox, Gee Walker, and Jo-Jo White, all of whom later played for the Detroit Tigers. Morrissey played for the St. Paul Saints of American Association in 1931. He played in 167 games, collecting 223 hits and setting a career-high in home runs with 22. Major league career Morrissey was sold to the Cincinnati Reds prior to the 1932 season. He broke a finger during spring training in 1933. The Reading Eagle reported that Morrisey \\"developed amazingly\\". He was a starter during the 1933 season, playing in 148 games and batting .230. Also a poor fielder, he was fifth in the league with 40 errors committed. He was released after the 1933 season and played in 17 games with the White Sox as a backup in 1936. During a May 27 game against the Tigers, while replacing Jimmy Dykes at third base, he made an error that cost the game for the White Sox, when he allowed three runs to score. Morrissey died at the age of 46 at Worcester, Massachusetts.

The company was started in 2007 by Daniel Kafie, Mario Schlosser, and Joshua Kushner. The main games developed by Vostu were Topfarm, Caf√© Mania, MegaCity, Mini Fazenda, GolMania, Candy Dash, Riddle Pic, Shaking Vegas, Magic Valley, among others. These social games are available on Orkut, Facebook and Google +. Today, more than 100 million users are registered in Vostu applications: one in every four Brazilians play one or more of their products. In 2011, the company was considered by Forbes Magazine as one of the top 10 startups in Brazil and Business Insider included it in the list of 100 world's most valuable startups. The company's current value is unknown and the company keeps secret about that value. However, TechCrunch had estimated at one time that its market value could reach $300 million. In 2011, the company announced the purchase of MP Game Studio, a company dedicated to casual & multiplayer games, expanding its portfolio of games. Later that same year, the company was sued by Zynga, alleging copyright infringement. An agreement between the companies closed the case. In early 2012, Vostu conducted a restructuring of the company's departments, unifying developments of the games in the Buenos Aires, Argentina office and business operations in Brazil. In mid-2012, the company shows the results of this restructuring with the launch of new social, casual and mobile games. By mid-2013, however, the company had laid off as much as two thirds of its personnel, with Schlosser and Kafie resigning their positions, and \\"internal management and political issues with the engineering and product teams\\" rendering the company \\"organizationally unable to add features or service games in a way that would keep players engaged\\".

To prepare the drinks, players had to collect guaran√°s from guaran√° plants outside of restaurants. *AdeS In September 2011 arrived some AdeS recipes at Caf√© Mania. Players could serve dishes and coffees prepared with the company's products. In addition to new recipes in the game, Vostu also created a contest in which players had to take a picture of one of the AdeS‚Äô recipes done in real life, competing for game credits. *Del Valle Juices This was an action of its cross-media campaign on TV, where Del Valle Juices tells why their juices were so tasty. At the Mini Fazenda, users received from their friends \\"Watering Cans of Affection\\" to care for their crops and winning the \\"Tender Touch\\", which sped up their crops and made them yield more. The promotion was launched in September 2011. *Netflix In that same month, Vostu has partnered with Netflix to offer their players a lot of credit to sign up for the service of the company. Caf√© Mania was one of the games that had provided this offer available only to Orkut players. This promotion reappeared many times in the game with other offers of credit. *Pepsi, Visa and Vivo Pepsi, Visa and Vivo went as partners in the Vostu GolMania launch in September 2011 and had their brands exposed in the middle of the soccer fields and on the boards of sponsorship, as well as in real soccer matches. *River Plate and Boca Juniors Broadening participation in GolMania in December 2011 two of the most important teams in America arrived at the game with the construction of stadiums and the possibility to play with their uniforms. *Corinthians In November 2011, Corinthians came in Mega City with exclusive items of Tim√£o for fans include in their cities. Furthermore, it was possible to build a replica of Corinthians future stadium, apply for tickets for the 2012 Paulist√£o games and shirts autographed by players from the team. *Vasco da Gama First Brazilian club to participate in GolMania, the Club de Regatas Vasco da Gama launched its stadium in April 2012. With the partnership, users can also play from the club's official fanpage on Facebook. *Ketchupp Hellmann's In May 2012, Ketchup Hellmann‚Äôs arrived in Mini Fazenda. The players had to receive special tomato seeds from their friends, plant them, and when harvesting Hellman's tomatoes, the players had to process them in the machine to receive special items such as profitable ketchups, potion to speed crops, tomatoes guardians of crops etc. *Decolar.com The partnership between Vostu and Decolar.com was presented in June 2012. The action was based on performance tasks that intended to broaden the interaction between the players of Mega City and the brand that appears on aircraft and on the airports of the \\"MegaCidades\\". The strategy of the game leads users to like Decolar.com Fan Page on Facebook and also to fulfill goals such as takeoff and landing aircraft, collect profits from hotels and exchange postcards. *Walmart In July 2012, Walmart launched a virtual store in MegaCity that allows users to make purchases via e-commerce. By accessing the platform, the player receives an invitation to make their purchases at the site of Walmart and can earn up to 100 \\"MegaGranas\\" at the Roulette of Fortune. The player can also do his shopping at the Walmart store through the game and earn 5% discount. =Celebrities= *Adriana Lima In May 2011, top model Adriana Lima has recorded a TV commercial to promote the launch of MegaCity. *Ivete Sangalo In June 2011, came into MegaCity several special items of the Brazilian singer Ivete Sangalo.

He discovered new types of instabilities in gravitating media, created the theory of planetary rings and predicted the existence of small Uranus satellites that were later discovered. He also developed hydrodynamic theory of the spiral structure in galaxies. Fridman worked at the Institute of Astronomy of the Russian Academy of Sciences, INASAN, and was professor of Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and Moscow State University. Biography Maksim and Alexey Fridman and Felitsia Sheinbaum, early 1950s. Alexey Fridman was born in Moscow on February 17, 1940, in a Jewish family, to Maksim Efimovich Fridman (surgeon, MD/Ph.D./Sci.D.; 1903‚Äì1990) and Felitsia Yakovlevna Sheinbaum (economist, 1907‚Äì1999). Polyachenko family lived in the same building, and Alik Fridman and Valerij Polyachenko's lifelong friendship (and later scientific collaboration) started before they were five years old. Following a brief arrest and release of Maksim Fridman perhaps on a prelude to \\"Doctors' plot\\" in 1951, the family moved to Frunze (now Bishkek), Kyrgyzstan. Alik spent summers in Moscow staying with the family of his father's sister, Elena Fridman, and her husband, David A. Frank-Kamenetskii. Following the death of Joseph Stalin and the general amnesty, cities with warm climate filled with criminals and the crime rates skyrocketed. Police was failing, and while in high school Alik and many other young men joined \\"the neighborhood watch\\" brigades organized by Komsomol and police. He did not miss a single training session in military sambo, and acquired many knife scars from the street action. He was the only one who remained alive from his team of four by the graduation. After high school graduation (1957), Alik attempted to enter Moscow Physics and Technology Institute, but was failed on the oral math exam as often happened to Jewish applicants. He spent this year at Kyrgyzstan University in Frunze, then entered the Kazan University (1958) where he did undergraduate research with Prof. A. Petrov. In 1958, at the age of 18, Alik passed the first exam, mathematics, in the series of Theoretical minimum, with Lev Landau. In 1960, on advice from David A. Frank-Kamenetskii, Alik transferred to Novosibirsk University, from which he graduated in 1963 with M. S. in Physics. Academic career of the young scientist went well until in 1968 he signed the \\"letter of 46\\" in defense of imprisoned dissidents. However, with support of many prominent scientists, most of the scientists \\"signers\\" careers (not fully) recovered, and even though, following defense, Alik's Doctor of Science dissertation spent over two years \\"waiting\\" to be considered for the approval of the Highest Attestation committee, the degree was finally awarded to him in 1972. In 1971 Alik was offered to create a laboratory of plasma physics in SibIZMIR (now Institute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics) Irkutsk, and he moved there with Valerij Polyachenko, Ilia Shukhman, and Alexander Morozov. ;Education: *1963 ‚Äì M.S., Novosibirsk State University *1966 ‚Äì Ph.D., Novosibirsk State University, \\"Selected questions in theory of stability of nonuniform plasma in magnetic field\\". *1972 ‚Äì Doctor of Sc., \\"Theory of gravitating ionised phase\\". ;Positions: *1966‚Äì1969 ‚Äì junior scientist, Institute of Nuclear Physics, Novosibirsk. *1969‚Äì1971 ‚Äì senior scientist, Institute of Nuclear Physics, Novosibirsk; assistant professor, Novosibirsk State University. *1971‚Äì1979 Head of laboratory, IZMIRAN, Irkutsk; department head, Irkutsk State University. *1979‚Äì1985 Senior scientist, Astronomical Council of the Academy of Sciences USSR; professor, Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology *1986‚Äì2010 Professor, Head of the Department of Physics of Stellar and Planetary Systems, Institute of Astronomy of the Russian Academy of Sciences; professor, Moscow State University. *2005‚Äì2010 Head of the Institute of Physics of Stochastic Structures, Kurchatov Research Center (Moscow). *2007‚Äì2010 Visiting Professor, Tel Aviv University. =Memberships= *1994 Elected corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, RAS *2000 Full member of RAS *1991‚Äì2010 Member of the Organizing committee of IAU =Doctoral students= *Among Prof. Fridman's Doctoral students, 10 received Doctor of Science degree, and 26 - Ph.

M. Fridman predicted the existence of the Alfven's solutions, and worked out the stability theory of thermonuclear plasma at finite high pressure. *In hydrodynamics, developed the theory of the three strongest instabilities of hydrodynamics: tangential discontinuity, centrifugal, and over-reflection instability. *In space physics: with his students, developed the linear theory of stability of classical figures of equilibrium in collisionless stellar systems, and laid the foundations of the nonlinear theory of stability and turbulence of gravitating media. As a result, the ranges of the parameters were derived for stability of stellar systems of different geometries. *A. M. Fridman discovered new types of non- Jeans instabilities in gravitating media, some of which develop at timescales less than Jeans' timescale, while others exist in systems that are stable according to Jeans. *With V. Polyachenko, A. M. Fridman derived a new type of asinphase eigen oscillations that exist in multi-component gravitating media as non-collapsing waves with the wavelength above the critical (that would be impossible in a single-component media). *In A. Fridman's works, it was first shown that solitons can exist in gravitating media, and transform into gravitating shock waves if dissipation is present. A. Fridman broke the traditional view that shock waves cannot exist in collisionless stellar systems, and proved the existence of \\"collisionless\\" shock waves in rotating stellar discs where the free path is the size of the epicycle. *A.M. Fridman first showed that Landau nonlinear damping can exist in stellar systems. *In the field of physics of planetary rings, A. Fridman with N. Gorkavyi developed the theory of transfer, collective and resonance processes in a system of non- elastic collisional gravitating particles, that explained the hierarchical structure of the Saturn rings, the resonance nature of the Uran rings, and allowed to predict the small satellites of Uran. The last theoretical prediction was then confirmed when 9 of the 10 satellites discovered by Voyager 2 were found in the predicted regions, with four on the pre-calculated orbits at less than 0.5% error. *In collaboration with colleagues, A. M. Fridman developed the hydrodynamic theory of galactic spiral structure generation. The theory was proved in an original experiment on rotating shallow water that was engineered at Kurchatov Research Center. Using results of this experiment, also giant anticyclones in discs of spiral galaxies were predicted. The anticyclones were later observed, derived from maps of galactic velocities (data from the 6 meter telescope RAS. *With O. Khoruzhii, A. M. Fridman developed nonlinear dynamics of astrophysics discs, deriving formation of mono and dipole vortices in discs, and the new type of accretion - acoustic drift - features that were later detected in planetary rings, and in the gas disc of our Galaxy. *A. M. Fridman developed the theory of weak turbulence for rotating gravitating systems that explains the correlation between main parameters of gas clouds and their structure in our Galaxy, and the observed mass spectrum of the clouds. *Seismodynamics and Ocean physics: with colleagues, A. M. Fridman discovered two components of the Earth's seismic activity: global and mirror. Calculated components of deformation tensor on the Earth surface (polygon in Kyrgyzstan, using 510 GPS stations over 1100 x 500 km^2) and showed correlation between the maxima of these components and the seismic activity regions. *With collaborators in Tel Aviv University, A. M. Fridman developed a program in modeling and destruction of tsunami. =Letter of the 46= A. M. Fridman was one of the 46 people who signed \\"the letter of the 46\\" in 1968 protesting against the closed court proceedings of four Moscow dissidents: A. Ginzburg, Yu. Galanskov, A. Dobrovolskii, and V. Lashkova, addressed to the Supreme Court of Russian Federal Republic and to the Attorney General of the USSR. The text of the letter was published in New York Times on March 23, 1968. A massive internal political campaign of repressions followed, in particular, Fridman was fired from Novosibirsk University, but continued to hold a position at the Institute of Nuclear Physics. =Publications= ;Books: *Observational Manifestation of Chaos in Astrophysical Objects, editors: Fridman, Marov, Miller *Physics of Planetary Rings: Celestial Mechanics of Continuous Media (Astronomy and Astrophysics Library) by Alexei M.

Major components ranged from about 5 to 15 years in age, and included the Mir Core Module, Kvant-1, Kvant-2, Kristall, Spektr, Priroda, and Docking Module. Although Russia was optimistic about Mir's future, the country's commitments to the International Space Station programme left no funding to support Mir. The deorbit was carried out in three stages. The first stage was waiting for atmospheric drag to decay the orbit to an average of . This began with the docking of Progress M1-5. The second stage was the transfer of the station into a orbit. This was achieved with two burns of the Progress M1-5's control engines at 00:32 UTC and 02:01 UTC on 23 March 2001. After a two-orbit pause, the third and final stage of Mirs deorbit began with the firing of Progress M1-5's control engines and main engine at 05:08 UTC, lasting a little over 22 minutes. The atmospheric entry at the altitude of occurred at 05:44 UTC near Nadi, Fiji. Background Mir three years before deorbit After the construction of the International Space Station began in 1998, Russian resources were split between the two stations. In 2000, Roscosmos signed an agreement with MirCorp to lease the station for commercial use, with the Soyuz TM-30 mission, intended to prepare the station for future use and conduct some commercial research, being flown later that year. This was to have been followed by more missions, including flights with space tourists. Due to the Russian government being concerned about MirCorp's ability to fund these missions, Roscosmos decided against funding the continued operation of Mir. In November 2000, Roscosmos decided to deorbit Mir, and the next month Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov signed an order to do so. By this stage Mir was well past the end of its design life, and Roscosmos General Director Yuri Koptev believed that \\"any of its systems could well fail at any time\\". Therefore, it was decided to deorbit it while it was still functioning rather than risk it falling back to Earth out of control, like Skylab in 1979 and Salyut 7 in 1991, potentially dropping debris over a populated area. Process The Mir Deorbit Monitoring Group, whose members were located in the Russian Mission Control Center (RMCC) and ESOC, was monitoring the whole dynamic phase of operation. Both RMCC control rooms in Moscow were used for the massive media presence during the final stages of operation. Real-time reports from RMCC were provided via teleconference during each deorbit burn to ESA spokespersons and representatives from national agencies. Video transmissions from RMCC were also made available to ESOC. Two out of three Progress M1-5 propulsion firings, at approximately 90 minute intervals, were used to bring the perigee of Mir down to an altitude of above the Earth's surface. A tough contact with the atmosphere occurred at altitude, when some of the external light elements of Mir were torn off due to the rush through the rarefied air. At an altitude of sufficient heating from Mir hull created a glowing halo of hot plasma. At about that time, the orbital complex broke apart and several of Mirs elements, surrounded by the plasma, were visible from Fiji against the evening sky. Television pictures were transmitted around the world within a few minutes of the event. The entire process lasted from about 16:20 to 20:29 local solar time. A short press conference was held in RMCC to cover the final stage of deorbit. An official statement announced that Mir \\"ceased to exist\\" at 05:59:24 GMT. The final tracking of Mir was conducted by a United States Army site on Kwajalein Atoll. The European Space Agency, German Federal Ministry of Defence and NASA also assisted with tracking Mir during its final orbit and reentry. Debris At the time, Mir was the largest spacecraft ever to reenter the Earth's atmosphere, and there were concerns that sizeable pieces of debris, particularly from the docking assemblies, gyrodynes and external structure, could survive reentry. Amid debris fall, New Zealand issued international warnings to ships and aircraft traveling in the South Pacific area. Deputy director of New Zealand's Maritime Safety Authority, Tony Martin, said that the chances of debris hitting ships would be very small. A similar situation occurred in Japan, whose residents were warned to stay indoors during the forty-minute period when debris was most likely to fall.

Location  The Steinerne Renne is east of the Harz National Park in the Harz/Saxony- Anhalt Nature Park. It lies southwest of Hasserode in the borough of Wernigerode in a forested stretch of the valley formed by the upper reaches of the Holtemme river between the hill of Renneckenberg (eastern neighbour of the Brocken) some distance away to the southwest, between the Bielstein (ca. ) to the north and the ridge of Hippeln and the Kontorberg (556.1 m) to the south.Die Steinerne Renne at www.harzlife.de. Retrieved on 7 Nov 2010. In the gorge, numerous small waterfalls and rapids alternate with quieter stretches of water in the Holtemme's rock and boulder-strewn riverbed. The entrance to the gorge below the Hannekenbruch lies at a height of about Sachsen-Anhalt- Viewer and the exit is below Steinerne Renne railway station at around , a height difference of about 250 metres. At 395.0 m the Kleine Renne empties into the Steinerne Renne from the left. The Steinerne Renne forest inn and hotel is perched above the point in river where it is 519.5 m high. In addition, there used to be a footbridge over the Holtemme somewhat further east (346.0 m) and a restaurant, Am Silbernern Mann, below the rocks known as the Silberner Mann.  History  The Steinerne Renne around 1900 This natural feature was already described as the Steinrenne or steinerne Rinne by the Early Modern Period. With the rise of tourism in the middle of the 19th century the Steinerne Renne became one of the most popular beauty spots in the Harz. When the Harz and Brocken Railways were built a small station was even built for the Steinerne Renne which still exists today. In 1869 a log cabin was built immediately next to the waterfall, the predecessor of the present- day hotel. The Steinerne Renne a forest inn and hotel Steinerne Renne station During the post-war period the spot ended up in East Germany and the hotel building was operated until the mid-1970s as a Handelsorganisation pub. Later it was converted and used as a works holiday home for the VEB Elektroaaparatewerke Berlin-Treptow, a German electrical machinery combine. The holiday home also had a public restaurant . When the building was converted, the romantic woodland path to the pub, which ran along the northern side of the Holtemme and past the waterfall, was blocked. Today the footpath runs along the southern bank of the river. The Steinerne Renne Hotel (Gasthaus Steinerne Renne) is No. 28 in the system of checkpoints in the Harzer Wandernadel.  Hydroelectricity  Near Steinerne Renne station there is a hydropower plant, opened in 1899, which was used to power the gravel and granite works operating in those days. In 1943 it went into the possession of the town of Wernigerode, which used it to supply power to the district of Hasserode. From 1945 it was run by the VEB Energiekombinat Magdeburg, later the VEB Instandsetzungsbetrieb f√ºr Batterien und Flurf√∂rderger√§te. After its privatization as WERBAT GmbH, the hydroelectric plant was sold in 1995 to a private owner. In 2002 it was sold back to the town, who operate it today as a technical monument. The water taken from a weir below the inn along a 1.7-kilometre enclosed channel to the screen house, where suspended solids are filtered out. Behind that, it drops over a 160 metre long penstock to the hydroelectric power plant. The current is generated by two Pelton turbines.  Concentration subcamp  On the site of the former granite and gravel plant, which has been used since 1944 as the Steinerne Renne Brickworks and for the construction of parts for aircraft engines, a subcamp of the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp was built. Initially French, Belgian and Italian forced labourers worked in the subcamp. Later 500 prisoners from the former subcamp on Veckenstedter Way in Wernigerode worked here. One day before the occupation of the camp by American troops on 10 April 1945 they were sent on a death march to Leitmeritz.  References  External links  * Die Steinerne Renne at www.harzlife.de.

Near Vini≈°te there is a formation of rocks called Kamiko. The village name reflects the good conditions in the region for cultivating grapes and making wine (Bulgarian vino, English wine).  History  This region of Bulgaria became part of the Roman Empire in 26 BC. About AD 150, the Romans built a stronghold in the region called Montana, and the military division that first settled there was recruited in the Swiss Alps. The town was populated by Latin-speaking local tribes who were later called Wallachs by the Slavs. Christianity was introduced in AD 325. Vini≈°te is first mentioned in 15th-century Ottoman tax documents. The village is located on an important road that connects Sofia with Vidin on the Danube river and from there to Central Europe. The road was used for carrying the collected taxes and military retreat first by the Romans (from the Balkans to Central Europe), by the Bulgarians and by the Turks (from Central Europe to Constantinople). Roman coins have been found around Vini≈°te and can be seen in the museums in Montana and Sofia.  Traditions  Though Vini≈°te has been Christian since the 9th century, pagan customs were maintained into the 20th century. One such custom is the kurban. In older days, kurban involved a ritualistic animal sacrifice but in modern times, it is a gathering around a special stone or other symbol.

This is notable as perhaps the oldest continuously open public restaurant in the world. In 1135 AD a building was erected as the construction office for the Regensburg stone bridge. When the bridge was finished in 1146 AD, the building became a restaurant named \\"Garkueche auf dem Kranchen\\" ('cookshop near the crane') as it was situated near the then river port. Dockers, sailors and the staff of the nearby St. Peter cathedral workshop were the regulars for the centuries to come. The present building at this location dates from the 17th century, but archaeological evidence has confirmed the existence of a previous building from the 12th century with about the same dimensions. Until ca. AD 1800, the specialty was 'gesottenes Fleisch' (boiled meat), but when the family who currently own the restaurant took over in 1806, charcoal grilled sausages were introduced as the main dish offered. The kitchen still operates today (daily 8AM‚Äì7PM, except holidays) and serves 6,000 sausages to guests daily. Sausages are the main dish on the menu and come in portions of six, eight or ten, along with sauerkraut and mustard.

In a career spanning almost 20 years, he made almost 250 appearances in the Football League for a total of five different clubs. Early life Born in the town of Hindley, Lancashire, Broadhurst played for his hometown club, Hindley Central, as a youth before joining Football League side Preston North End in April 1910.  Career  He signed his first professional contract with North End in August of the same year and went on to make two league appearances during the 1910‚Äì11 season. Broadhurst returned to Hindley Central on loan in March 1913, before his career was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War, which halted all competitive football in England for four seasons between 1915 and 1919. Upon the recommencement of League football in 1919‚Äì20, Broadhurst was awarded ¬£400 (¬£ as of ) by Preston for completing ten seasons with the team. In the summer of 1922, having played 107 league matches and scored 3 goals for North End, Broadhurst moved to Stalybridge Celtic, who had joined the Football League the previous year following the formation of the Third Division North. He missed only two matches of the 1922‚Äì23 campaign, making 36 league appearances for the side as they finished 11th in the league.Joyce (2004), p. 298 However, Stalybridge left the League at the end of the season, and Broadhurst subsequently moved to Second Division outfit Stockport County. He did not feature regularly with his new club, however, and played only four matches for them. A return to the Third Division North with Barrow followed in June 1924, and Broadhurst was almost ever-present during the 1924‚Äì25 season as the side ended the campaign in 14th position. Broadhurst joined Nelson in June 1925 and made his debut for the club on 29 August 1925 in the 2‚Äì1 win against Crewe Alexandra at Seedhill. He retained his place in the starting eleven for some time, playing in 36 competitive league matches before being replaced by Walter Chadwick for the 0‚Äì3 loss to Grimsby Town on 17 April 1926. Throughout the 1926‚Äì27 campaign, Broadhurst shared right-back duties with Clement Rigg and James Pearson. His final appearance for Nelson came on 7 May 1927, in the 0‚Äì2 defeat at home to Tranmere Rovers. He left the club at the end of the season and, at the age of 38, moved into non-league football with Chorley of the Lancashire Combination.
