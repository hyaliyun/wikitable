The fighting soon spread, causing hundreds of casualties, and continued on at various levels of intensity until October. The battle's name usually includes the year, when referenced, in order to distinguish it amongst the nine major Battles of Mogadishu during the decades long Somali Civil War. The Islamist offensive lasted from 8 to 14 May and ended with relative success as they managed to take control over most of the capital, while ARS-D and government (TFG) forces withdrew into AMISOM protected territories. But despite major gains, the rebels failed to topple the government during the eight days of fighting and small scale clashes continued until 22 May, when the government launched a major offensive to retake the city, as Islamist forces had mostly withdrawn into the Central Region and the government was now backed by powerful warlord Indho Ade. The government offensive initially had some success as they captured a few bases, however in a matter of hours the Islamist launched a successful counter offensive and re-captured the lost areas and made even more gains. As a result, the government offensive was aborted on 23 May.

The government launched another offensive on 1 July, insurgents however successfully repelled the offensive, making gains until 5 July, when al-Shabaab's leader Sheikh Moktar Ali Zubeyr gave government forces a five-day ultimatum to hand over their weapons. The ultimatum was however rejected and so, al-Shabaab launched several attacks on key sites in the city provoking a major government offensive on 11 ‚Äì 12 July, which led to a total expulsion of Islamist forces from the city. Islamists however returned on 13 July, with large re-enforcements from the South Eastern Region, government forces withdrew from all captured positions and minor clashes continued.

The number was originally written as \\"Replay\\" (The Way We Live Now) for the 1970 short film Replay, with both music and lyrics by Strouse.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418102/ Composition and lyrics In 1972 Strouse, Charnin and Thomas Meehan began working on a musical based on the Little Orphan Annie comic strips, Annie. Strouse contributed a reworked version of \\"Replay\\" as \\"Tomorrow\\". \\"Annie\\" took until 1976 to reach Broadwayhttps://www.playbill.com/article/cast-changes-rewrites-and-more-from- yesterday-to-tomorrow-annies-history-on-stage-and-screen-com-337596 and during that time Strouse reworked \\"Replay\\" again for possible use in what became \\"Charlie and Algernon\\", a musical version of Daniel Keyes's Flowers for Algernon with book by playwright David Rogers although it was not ultimately used. \\" The song has always been prominently featured in productions of the musical throughout its history: several variations of the song were performed in the original 1977 Broadway production, including being the show's finale. Its lyrics are repeated as a personal motto by the character of Annie in Thomas Meehan's 1980 novelisation. It was the entry and concluding credits score for the 1982 film adaptation; an a capella version of the song was performed by Aileen Quinn as Annie during the scene at the White House where Annie and Warbucks meet Franklin D. Roosevelt. The song pronounces an optimistic view of life through its main themes and the phrases 'hang on until tomorrow' and 'when I'm stuck with a day that's gray and lonely, I just stick out my chin and grin'. It appears to be in unison with another song in the score, \\"You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile\\", which again pronounces the importance of smiling, though in a much lighter and cheerful tone. The lyrics were likely influenced by the song \\"There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow\\", written by the Sherman Brothers for Disney's Carousel of Progress attraction for the 1964 New York World's Fair. They have very similar themes, stressing the importance of looking forward optimistically to a shining future, and in some places use almost identical lyrical phrases (compare \\"just a dream away\\" and \\"only a day away,\\" for example).  Cover versions  Cissy Houston, (Mother of Whitney Houston) recorded a cover of this song as a single as well as a track on her 1977 self titled album Cissy Houston, Grace Jones recorded a disco version of the song on her debut album Portfolio, in 1977. The song was recorded by Barbra Streisand on her 1978 album Songbird; by The Manhattans on their 1978 album There's No Good in Goodbye; and by Lou Rawls on his 1979 album Let Me Be Good to You. It was also sung by Petula Clark with the Muppets in the background near the end of \\"The Muppet Show\\" episode of her own name. Patricia Paay from The Star Sisters also recorded and released her version in 1982. Elaine Paige recorded an up-tempo version for her 1983 album Stages, and a live version from her 40th-anniversary tour is included on the 2008 live album Elaine Paige Live. Lea Salonga recorded it on her album, I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing. Me First and the Gimme Gimmes recorded a punk rock version for their 1999 album Are a Drag. It is featured as a hidden track on the 2002 compilation album Land by Patti Smith. Amy Diamond recorded a pop version on her debut album This Is Me Now, in 2005. Alvin and the Chipmunks covered this song in their 1982 album The Chipmunks Go Hollywood. The Chipettes also covered this song in The Chipette Story, an episode from Alvin and the Chipmunks. The song was covered by the Rock-afire Explosion animatronic band of ShowBiz Pizza Place in the 1982 \\"Tribute to Abbey Road\\" showtape. It, sung by Mitzi Mozzarella, was combined with Maybe and was the first major song sung by Mitzi's current voice actress, Shalisa Sloan, at the age of 11. Lisa Whelchel as Blair Warner performed the chorus of the song with a sock puppet on her hand on a 1987 The Facts of Life episode called Boy About The House in which Beverly Ann (Cloris Leachman) adopts Andy (Mackenzie Astin). Kevin Kline and Sigourney Weaver sing an a capella version in the 1993 film Dave. Former Los Angeles Dodgers organist Nancy Bea Hefley would play the song following a Dodgers loss as an inspirational message. Anaheim Ducks organist Gil Imber has continued the tradition. The song appears in the 2008 film Igor in the climax of the movie involving a giant robot portraying Annie. Broadway star Idina Menzel covered the song as the final encore on her 2010‚Äì2011 Symphony Tour. In 2013, the song became the official campaign song for the charity Save the Children, sung by Liverpool chorister Jack Topping.\\"Choirboy sensation Jack Topping joins Save the Children\\" Save The Children Sept 2013. Accessed 19 December 2013 In 2015, the song was performed by New Zealand pop singer Gin Wigmore for a series of television commercials advertising Air New Zealand. The song is featured in Deadpool 2 (2018). Ryan Reynolds also performed a live version of the song on the South Korean series King of Mask Singer. In March 2020, Jennifer Nettles released a version of Tomorrow as Covid-19 was spreading through New York City with a music video, writing \\"And to my beautiful Broadway community: I recorded this song with Alex Lacamoire on March 12th, the day that Broadway had to shut its doors in order to protect their patrons by no longer assembling in the beautiful masses that come to enjoy story telling through theatre. Alex and I were in the studio finishing an album of theatre songs...It seemed poignantly and eerily kismet that we recorded it as the last session, on our last day in the studio, and then found out Broadway was closed.

It is a primary learning method in yeshivas and kollels, where students often engage regular study partners of similar knowledge and ability, and is also practiced by those outside the yeshiva setting, in work, home, and vacation settings. The traditional phrase is to learn b'chavrusa (◊ë÷∞◊ó÷∑◊ë÷∞◊®◊ï÷º◊™÷∏◊ê, \\"in chavrusa\\"; i.e., in partnership); the word has come by metonymy to refer to the study partner as an individual, though it would more logically describe the pair. Unlike a teacher-student relationship, in which the student memorizes and repeats the material back in tests, chavrusa-style learning puts each student in the position of analyzing the text, organizing his thoughts into logical arguments, explaining his reasoning to his partner, hearing out his partner's reasoning, and questioning and sharpening each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights into the meaning of the text. While chavrusa-style learning is traditionally practiced by men and boys, it has also become popular in women's yeshivas that study Talmudic texts. In the 2000s it was extended to telephone and internet learning sessions in which partners study Talmud as well as other traditional Jewish texts. Definition Chavrusa is an Aramaic word meaning \\"friendship\\" or \\"companionship\\". The Rabbis of the Mishnah and Gemara use the cognate term chaver (◊ó◊ë◊®, \\"friend\\" or \\"companion\\" in Hebrew) to refer to the one with whom a person studies Torah. In contemporary usage, chavrusa is defined as a \\"study partner\\". In Orthodox Judaism, a chavrusa always refers to two students learning one on one. When three or more students learn together, they are called a chavurah (, group). Reform Judaism has expanded the idea of chavrusa to include two, three, four or even five individuals studying together. It has also extended the material being studied beyond traditional texts, to modern scholarship and poetry. The Reform and Conservative movements have also altered the idea of chavurah from its Orthodox meaning of groups that meet only for Torah study. In Reform and Conservative terminology, a chavurah is a group of individuals or families which is part study or prayer group, part social club. Origin Based on statements in the Mishnah and Gemara, chavrusa learning was a key feature of yeshivas in the eras of the Tannaim (Rabbis of the Mishnaic period, 10-220 CE) and Amoraim (Rabbis of the Talmudic period, 200 to 500 CE). The Rabbis repeatedly urged their students to acquire a study partner; for example, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Perachya enjoined students to \\"Make for yourself a Rav and acquire for yourself a chaver\\",Avot 1:6. and Rabbi Yose ben Chalafta told his son Rabbi Abba that he was ignorant because he did not study with someone else.Yerushalmi Nedarim 11:1, 41c. The choice of chavrusas seems to have been based on friendship or social proximity; thus, chavrusas fulfilled a social as well as an educational need. While an individual may choose to study Talmud alone, it is strongly discouraged. In the Talmud, R. Yosi b. R. Hanina is quoted as saying that \\"scholars who sit alone to study the Torah ... become stupid\\" (Berakhot 63b). Chavrusa-style learning is particularly suited to Talmud study, as the latter is a text filled with conflicting opinions and seemingly contradictory statements on principles of Jewish law. Besides tracking the back-and-forth debates, a student of Talmud must be able to analyze each opinion and present hypotheses to reconcile it in light of the others. The chavrusa relationship gives each student a platform to clarify and explain his position to a partner; then the two go on to question, defend, convince, amend, fine-tune, and even arrive at new conclusions through rigorous intellectual collaboration. Educational benefits Unlike conventional classroom learning, in which a teacher lectures to the student and the student memorizes and repeats the information back in tests, and unlike an academic seminary, where students do independent research, chavrusa learning challenges the student to analyze and verbally explain the material, point out the errors in his partner's reasoning, and question and sharpen each other's ideas, often arriving at entirely new insights into the meaning of the text. A chavrusa helps the student stay awake, keep his mind focused on the learning, sharpen his reasoning powers, develop his thoughts into words, and organize his thoughts into logical arguments. This type of learning also imparts precision and clarity into ideas that would otherwise remain vague. Having to listen to, analyze and respond to another's opinion inculcates respect for others. It is considered poor manners to interrupt one's chavrusa. The chavrusa relationship also strengthens the student's personal commitment to his studies, as he is loath to disappoint or cancel on his chavrusa. Practice Chavrusa learning takes place in the formalized structure of the yeshiva or kollel, as well as in Talmudic study that an individual does at any time of day. Although a man skilled in learning could study certain topics on his own, the chavrusa relationship is preferred to help him crystallize his thoughts. In the yeshiva setting, students prepare for and review the shiur (lecture) with their chavrusas during morning, afternoon, and evening study sessions known as sedarim. On average, a yeshiva student spends ten hours per day learning in chavrusa.Helmreich, The World of the Yeshiva, p. 112. Since having the right chavrusa makes all the difference between having a good year and a bad year, class rebbis may switch chavrusas eight or nine times in a class of 20 boys until the partnerships work for both sides. If a chavrusa gets stuck on a difficult point or needs further clarification, they can turn to the rabbis, lecturers, or a sho'el u'mashiv (literally, \\"ask and answer\\", a rabbi who is intimately familiar with the Talmudic text being studied) who are available to them in the study hall during sedarim. In women's yeshiva programs, teachers are on hand to guide the chavrusas. Chavrusa learning tends to be loud and animated, as the study partners read the Talmudic text and the commentaries aloud to each other and then analyze, question, debate, and defend their points of view to arrive at a mutual understanding of the text. In the heat of discussion, they may wave their hands or even shout at each other. Depending on the size of the yeshiva, dozens or even hundreds of chavrusas can be heard discussing and debating each other's opinions. One of the skills of chavrusa learning is the ability to block out all other discussions in the study hall and focus on one's study partner alone. Choosing a chavrusa Pairing up study partners has been compared to making a shidduch (marriage match), as the skills, interests, temperament and schedule of each person must be taken into consideration. Good friends do not necessarily make good chavrusas. If the chavrusas spend too much time chatting or joking with each other at the expense of their study time, they are advised to find different study partners. In the yeshiva world, the brightest students are highly desirable as chavrusas. However, there are pros and cons to learning with chavrusas who are stronger, weaker, or equal in knowledge and ability to the student. A stronger chavrusa will correct and fill in the student's knowledge and help him improve his learning techniques, acting more like a teacher. With a chavrusa who is equal in knowledge and ability, the student is forced to prove his point with logic rather than by right of seniority, which improves his ability to think logically, analyze other people's opinions objectively, and accept criticism. With a weaker chavrusa, who often worries over and questions each step, the student is forced to understand the material thoroughly, refine and organize his thoughts in a logical structure, present his viewpoint clearly, and be ready to justify each and every point. The stronger chavrusa helps the student acquire a great deal of information, but the weaker chavrusa helps the student learn how to learn. Yeshiva students are usually advised to have one of each of these three types of chavrusas in order to develop on all three levels. Tumult day in Beth Medrash Govoha. Beth Medrash Govoha in Lakewood Township, New Jersey is known for its \\"tumult day\\" at the beginning of each z'man (semester), when thousands of students mingle outdoors with the goal of choosing a chavrusa for the new term. A similar \\"tumult day\\" takes place among the hundreds of students at the main Brisk yeshiva in Jerusalem, and at the Mir in Jerusalem. Chavrusas often develop into lasting friendships. The shared commitment to scholarship and intellectual growth creates a close bond between study partners Second, revised edition that has been said to be closer than that of many married couples. Women's chavrusas Women's yeshivas that include Talmud study on the curriculum often schedule chavrusa study sessions for their students. In Orthodox women's seminaries, students are paired with study partners of equal or greater strength to learn Halakha, Chumash, Jewish philosophy, or any other topic in Judaism. In recent years, telephone study partnerships for women have been promoted as a kiruv (Orthodox Judaism outreach) tool in Israel and as an option for busy homemakers. Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld, Chief Rabbi of Mandatory Palestine, reportedly had a regular half-hour chavrusa with his wife, during which they studied Orach Chayim . Telephone and online chavrusas Partners in Torah was the first was the first to move chavrusa- style learning out of the yeshiva and synagogue and into telephone study sessions in 1997. During the 2000s, many free internet services began matching up study partners around the world using videoconferencing and Skype hook-ups. =Telephone chavrusas= * TorahMates, a free chavrusa program of national nonprofit Oorah, offers to partner knowledgeable volunteers with students with weaker backgrounds to study any Jewish topics of their choice, with coordinators on staff to ensure the partnership works well. *Partners in Torah -- founded in 1991 as a one-on-one study program for Jewish day school parents under the umbrella of Torah Umesorah, the National Society for Hebrew Day Schools.

They are \\"superfiring\\" because one has been mounted over the other, and can shoot over its top. Superfiring armament is a naval military building technique according to which two (or more) turrets are located in a line, one behind the other, but with the second turret located above (\\"super\\") the one in front so that the second turret could fire over the first. This configuration meant that both forward or aft turrets could fire at any target within their sector, even when the target was in the same vertical plane as the turrets.  History  The history of large surface warships follow generic labels as battleships, and a further distinction between pre- dreadnoughts and dreadnoughts. The era of technical evolution occurred roughly from 1900 to 1945. Part of the technical evolution was driven by the need to compress as much large-gun firepower into the smallest space possible. In early designs, the large-caliber turrets were all located on the same plane firing to one side or the other. In firing ahead or to the rear, usually only the forward-most or rearmost turret could fire, especially at low angles. Line drawing of a South Carolina-class battleship, showing superfiring main armament.Reprinted from Brassey's Naval Annual, 1912. An early concern was that the pressure and shock from the higher turret would damage the lower one when firing over the top. In 1908, United States Navy tests using the monitor as the testbed proved that superfiring was safe. The result was the design for the first (commissioned in 1910). The first ship with superfiring artillery (though not of the same caliber), was the French battleship Henri IV, launched in 1899.Roger Chesneau, Eug√®ne Kolesnik (ed.): Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships, 1860-1905, Conway Maritime Press, London, 1979, , p.295 Superfiring was not limited to only two turrets. For example, the Atlanta- class of light cruiser, which were developed and built for service in World War II, utilized a triple-overlap system both forward and astern, their armament of dual-mount 5\\"/38 caliber dual-purpose main armament having a nearly unobstructed arc of fire.  Advantages and disadvantages  Advantages of superfiring turrets over non-superfiring arrangements include improved firing arcs for all except the foremost and rearmost turrets, as well as an increase of useful deck space on which to build the ship's superstructure thanks to the concentration of the main batteries towards the ends of the ship. Depending on the design of the ship and its weapons, it may also help to avoid issues with the ship's propulsion. The Japanese battleship Fuso featured a combination of superfiring and non-superfiring turrets. The placement of the Z-turret (third from the stern) interfered with the steam turbines, requiring it to be raised above the deck. These advantages do however come at the cost of raising the centre of mass as a result of the higher placement of turrets, thus decreasing the metacentric height. This decrease in stability may cause issues if not corrected by compromises elsewhere to keep the center of mass low. Because of this, superfiring arrangements, while common, are not used exclusively. Examples of non-superfiring designs include but are not limited to the Gangut, Imperatritsa Mariya, and Imperator Nikolai classes of battleships built for the Imperial Russian navy, as well as modern ships such as the Zumwalt-class destroyers. In addition, many ships, such as the New York-class battleships, used combinations of superfiring and non-superfiring arrangements. Exclusively non-superfiring arrangements also remained common on destroyers.

He played at representative level for Great Britain, England, English League XIII and Yorkshire, and at club level for Wakefield Trinity (Heritage No. 333) and Leeds as a , i.e. number 2 or 5, and coached at club level for Featherstone Rovers. Background Stanley Smith worked as a foreman at a stone quarry in Tadcaster. Playing careerClub career= Smith started his career at Wakefield Trinity before he was transferred to Leeds during January 1930 for a record fee of ¬£1,075, (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately ¬£307,200 in 2014). Smith played , i.e. number 5, in Leeds' 2‚Äì8 defeat by Hunslet in the Championship Final during the 1937‚Äì38 season at Elland Road, Leeds on Saturday 30 April 1938. Smith retired from first class rugby in January 1940 having played for Leeds for 10 years. He had a long-standing plan to retire from rugby so that he and his wife Hilda could focus on running their pub the Butchers Arms on Williams Street in Wakefield but the outbreak of WWII saw him joining the Army at the age of 30. Stan served in the REME seeing service throughout the North African and Italian campaigns and returning home in late 1945. =International honours= Stan Smith won caps for England while at Leeds in 1931 against Wales, in 1932 against Wales (2 matches), in 1934 against Australia, and France, in 1935 against France, and won caps for Great Britain while at Wakefield Trinity in 1929 against Australia, while at Leeds in 1930 against Australia (2 matches), in 1932 against Australia (3 matches), and New Zealand (3 matches), and in 1933 against Australia (2 matches). Stan Smith played twice for an English rugby league representative XIII against France. Playing at left-wing on both occasions, the first was at Wilderspool Stadium, Warrington on 17 March 1934 when the English team won 32‚Äì16, this game was also the first international match played by the France national rugby league team. The second was at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds just over a year later, on 6 May 1935 when the English side won 25‚Äì18. =County honours= Stan Smith won cap(s) for Yorkshire while at Wakefield Trinity. =County Cup Final appearances= Stanley Smith played , i.e. number 5, in Leeds' 14-8 victory over Huddersfield in the 1937‚Äì38 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1937‚Äì38 season at Belle Vue, Wakefield on Saturday 30 October 1937. The record for the most tries in a Yorkshire County Cup Final is 4-tries, and is jointly held by; Stan Moorhouse, Alan Smith, and Stanley Smith. Genealogical information Stan had family links to several well known rugby players, notably in the Batten and Metcalfe families. Stan's mother Selena and Billy Batten's wife Annie were sisters so Billy was Stan's uncle by marriage and Billy's rugby playing sons, Billy (Jr), Eric and Bob, and his grandson Ray were Stan's cousins. Whilst a player at Trinity Stan became good friends with his teammate Jimmy Metcalfe the son of James Davis Metcalfe who played at full back for Trinity in the period 1897-1911. Jimmy (Jr) introduced Stan to his sister Hilda and the two were married in 1932. Jimmy's (Jr) son Donald Metcalfe, played for Trinity in the 1950s and was Stan's nephew by marriage.

Mainali is the pioneer and one of the well-known short story writers of Nepali literature. He is famous for his short story anthology 'Naaso'. Early life Mainali was born in a middle class Brahmin family in Kanpur, Kavrepalanchok. He was a son of Kashi Nath Mainali and Kashi Rupa Devi Mainali. He joined a government job for his living. Career Mainali's works contributed to the development of Nepali short stories. Altogether, Mainali wrote only eleven short stories, but his knowledge of the Nepalese society made him an excellent describer of the life in the country side. His stories alone possessed all the qualities of modern short stories during his time. He started writing stories to publish in a literary magazine, 'Sharada (Devnagari: ‡§∂‡§æ‡§∞‡§¶‡§æ)'. His first story was 'Naso' (The Ward). Most of his stories were published in the period between 1935 and 1938. Strongly influenced by Prem Chand, the famous Hindi fiction writer, Mainali intimately dealt with his characters from rural Nepal. Due to his contact with different kinds of people in different parts of the country as a judge transferred from one district court to the other, Mainali had ample opportunity to study the human character in various situations at close quarters. His description of the sad plight of the common people in Nepal due to constraints imposed upon individuals by traditional values and beliefs made in his stories remains unmatched even today. He is arguably the first modern short story writer of Nepal. Some of his unforgettable short stories are 'Naso' (The Ward), 'Paralko Aago' (A Blaze in the Straw), 'Shaheed' (The Martyr) and 'Chhimeki' (Neighbors). Naso is also the title of his anthology. Some of his stories are included in text books of primary school and secondary schools in Nepal. 'Naso' and 'Paralko Aago' are available in English versions. The former was translated as 'The Ward' by Theodore Riccardi in 1964 and the later was translated as 'A Blaze in the Straw' by Michael Hutt in 1991.

Today Trainriders Northeast may be most well known for their role in bringing passenger service back to Portland, with the Amtrak Downeaster. The organization was established not only to promote the extension of rail service, but to educate the public on the pros of rail. They also support comprehensive transportation planning, or creating long-term regional transportation plans. History The Downeaster Trainriders Northeast adopted five goals when they were organized in 1989, the first being the return of passenger rail service to Maine from Boston on the former Pine Tree route of the Boston & Maine and the Maine Central. One of the original goals was to return passenger rail service from Portland to Brunswick, where Amtrak service could connect with the Maine Eastern Railroad. This was accomplished with a $35 million federal grant. The Maine Eastern Railroad operates a scenic train with service from Brunswick to Rockland, via Bath and Wiscasset. Pan Am Railways completed the work on time and on budget. The Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority initiated passenger rail service to Freeport and Brunswick in December 2012. Goals and objectives Trainriders Northeast also hope to return passenger rail service to Bangor, via Lewiston ‚Äì Waterville, and via Brunswick ‚Äì Augusta, along with returning passenger rail service to other areas of Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. The organization also states that it is in their goals to improve and upgrade the current rail system through northern New England.

Spiritual teaching The essence of Hamblin's mystical experience and philosophy was of the omnipresence, omnipotence and all-goodness of God (\\"The Kingdom or realm of God is with us now and always\\").A Modern Mystic of the West (Article by Gilbert Gedge) He believed that \\"abounding health, sufficiency of supply, achievement, accomplishment and joy indescribable are the normal state for man.\\", and that, to achieve this state, man needed to come into \\"harmony with Cosmic Law\\". Over time the emphasis of Hamblin's written work changed from showing people how to change their lives through right thought and faith, to teaching them how to find a living consciousness of God for himself alone. Hamblin's work is continued to this day through the Hamblin Trust,The Hamblin Trust (Website) a registered charity which publishes his books and the magazine, \\"New Vision\\" (founded in 1921).

Its last assignment was with First Air Force stationed at Mitchel Field, New York. It was inactivated on 7 November 1945. During World War II the group was assigned to Ninth Air Force in Western Europe. It was awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation for a mission on 20 March 1945, that greatly facilitated the crossing of the Rhine River by Allied ground forces: without losing any planes, the group repeatedly dived through barrages of antiaircraft fire to bomb vital airfields east of the river; also attacked rail lines and highways leading to the Rhine, hitting rolling stock, motor transports, and other objectives. The 373d was redesignated as the 146th Fighter Group, and allotted to the California Air National Guard on 24 May 1946. History During World War II the 373d Fighter Group participated in the aerial operations which made possible the establishment of the Normandy beachhead and the rapid advance of the Allied ground forces into Germany. Although in combat only 12 months, the Group took part in six campaigns and was awarded one Distinguished Unit Citation for outstanding performance of duty in action. AFHRA 373d Fighter Group History The unit was constituted as the 373d Fighter Group on 25 May 1943. The unit, consisting of the 410th, 411th, and 412th Fighter Squadrons, was activated at Westover Field, Massachusetts, on 15 August 1943. The original personnel for the 373d were supplied by the 326th Fighter Group. Training for the 373d Fighter Group began at Westover Field in September 1943 and was continued at Norfolk Army Airfield, Virginia, where the unit moved on 22 October. On 12 February 1944 the group's training was brought to a halt and the organization prepared for its departure overseas. The group moved to Camp Shanks, New York, on 15 March. One week later the unit's personnel moved to the New York Port of Embarkation, boarded HMS Duchess of Bedford, and on the following day sailed for Great Britain. The ship reached Greenock, Scotland, on 3 April, and the men disembarked and moved to their new station at RAF Woodchurch, Kent, England. During the remainder of the month the group prepared for combat operations by flying training missions. Some of the pilots, in order to gain experience, participated in missions with the 358th Fighter Group. The 373d Fighter Group flew its first combat mission‚Äîa fighter sweep over the coast of France‚Äîon 8 May 1944. No aerial opposition or flak was encountered. All planes returned safely to their base. Three days later the unit escorted a group of Martin B-26 Marauder bombers to France. Then, on 21 May, the unit participated in its first strike into Germany, when 50 of its Republic P-47 Thunderbolts conducted a fighter sweep over the lower Ruhr Valley. The unit met its first enemy air opposition on the mission of 24 May, when it was attacked by seven Focke-Wulf Fw 190s while escorting bombers to Belgium. Three days later the group completed its first dive-bombing mission‚Äîa strike against a railway bridge in the vicinity of Rouen. During another strike on that same target later in the day, the unit's pilots scored three direct hits. The mission accomplished by the 373d Fighter Group in May 1944 prepared the unit for the tremendous tasks it was to undertake during the month of June. In all, the 373d completed 54 missions, consisting of 1,532 sorties, during the month. Fourteen of its missions were flown on D-Day (6 June), when it patrolled the beaches and provided top cover for other outfits in dive-bombing attacks against enemy targets. In the days succeeding the successful establishment of the Normandy beachhead the 373d Group swept behind enemy lines, attacking motor convoys, troops, transportation facilities, and other tactical and interdictory targets, in an effort to isolate the battlefield. Often the pilots directed their strikes against any target of opportunity which would hamper the movement of enemy supplies, hinder communications, and check the flow of German reinforcements to the front. On 25 June, the 411th Squadron became the first component of the 373d Fighter Group to land in France. On that day the squadron was sent out to patrol the area between Le Havre and Cap de Barfleur. When their fuel supply was nearly exhausted the squadron's P-47s were relieved by aircraft from one of the other squadrons, and the pilots landed Azeville Airfield (A-7) on the Cotentin Peninsula. At that landing strip the planes were refueled and the pilots took off to patrol the same area. Later they returned to their base at Woodchurch. Although the 373d Group was primarily concerned with ground support and interdiction operations, it did, on several occasions, engage the enemy in aerial combat. For example, on 7 June, one day after the landings, the 410th Fighter Squadron accounted for three aerial victories. On 29 June, while the 411th Fighter Squadron was providing top cover for a dive-bombing strike against rolling stock in the Le Mans-Tours area, its pilots ran into seven Messerschmitt Bf 109s. In the battle which ensued the 411th's pilots chalked up five aerial victories. The movement of the 373d Fighter Group to France in July 1944 hindered its operations during the latter part of the month; however, in August the Group's operations were once again in high gear. With reduced flying distance to and from the front lines the unit was able to complete 94 missions during the month. Most of those missions were in support of General George Patton's United States Third Army, which during the month burst out of Normandy and into Brittany, liberated all of that peninsula except three port cities, and swept past Paris to within of the German border. During that rapid advance across France the 373d Fighter Group and other XIX Tactical Air Command units blazed the way for General Patton's tank columns. The 373d, along with the other units, provided \\"umbrella cover\\" for the advancing ground forces, knocked out enemy rail and railroad transportation, and struck again and again at enemy tanks, gun emplacements, troop concentrations, and strongpoints. Late in August and early in September the 373d Fighter Group devoted much of its attention to blasting the German fortifications at Brest. After the Third Army burst out of Normandy at Avranches on 1 August and began its rapid advance to the east, the first real stumbling block was met at Brest. The old fortifications of that city had been reinforced by the Germans and presented a barrier to American troops. In spite of repeated air attacks and shelling by 31 artillery battalions, the enemy still held on to its position. Early in September the Ninth Air Force made the city its primary objective. In addition to continuing its air attacks with bombardment aircraft, the Ninth Air Force directed eight fighter groups, (one of which was the 373d), consisting of approximately 400 planes, to provide air cooperation for the troops assaulting the city. Continuous dive-bombing and strafing attacks by the 373d Fighter Group and its sister organizations finally forced the enemy to withdraw into the city itself. In the final phase of the assault the 373d attacked enemy strongpoints which were obstructing the progress of our ground troops. After 12 September the 373d Fighter Group returned to supporting the front line elements of General Patton's Third Army. Despite the fact that the unit's base was far from the front lines, it completed 67 dive-bombing and reconnaissance missions‚Äîsome of them to targets as far away as Luxembourg and Saarbr√ºcken. On 1 October 1944 the 373d Fighter Group was transferred from the XIX Tactical Air Command to the newly formed XXIX Tactical Air Command. Thereafter the 373d sought to isolate the front line battle areas by cutting rails and by destroying bridges and other transportation targets; and it gave direct ground support to elements of the Ninth Army by hitting enemy strongpoints, tanks, and gun positions. Late in October the Group moved to Le Culot Airfield (A-68), Belgium, where it was located when, on 16 December, the Germans began their historic breakthrough which resulted in the Battle of the Bulge. From 19 to 23 December, while the Germans smashed Allied positions, Allied airpower lay helpless, bound down by unfavorable weather conditions which helped to shield the German thrust. Then, on 24 December the weather cleared and the 373d Group and other air units flew attack after attack in support of our beleaguered ground forces through the remainder of December and during the entire month of January 1945. The German thrust was checked, and the enemy was slowly pushed back. So effective were the Allied aerial blows that by 1 February our ground forces had regained the positions held prior to 16 December. Throughout that entire battle the 373d Group played a small but significant role. Despite snow, fog, freezing rain, and cold weather, the group flew 13 missions during the month of January. Typical of the results attained in the missions were those of 1 January. On that day the unit destroyed 18 vehicles, 27 buildings, 15 railroad cars, and 4 tanks, and effected 19 road and railroad cuts. In February 1945 the Germans, with their attempted breakthrough thwarted, were retreating rapidly. To cut off that retreat and to prevent the Germans from forming a line of defense, the 373d Fighter Group and other XXIX Tactical Air Command units made repeated attacks against the enemy's retreating columns and against transportation targets behind enemy lines. During the month the group destroyed a total of 605 buildings, 412 railroad cars, 12 locomotives, 88 motor vehicles, and 2 tanks. The unit also effected 193 railroad and road cuts. and it blasted bridges, supply dumps. ammunition stores, gun positions, and pockets of resistance. Operations of that type continued until the war came to an end early in May 1945. On 20 March 1945, when the group's pilots destroyed or damaged 119 enemy aircraft on the ground. When the war ended the 373d Fighter Group was stationed at Lippstadt, Germany. Later in the month the unit moved to Illesheim. Germany, where it remained until some time in July. The group then moved back to England, where on 25 July it boarded and sailed for the United States. After arriving at the Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation on 1 August, the Group moved to Camp Patrick Henry, Virginia. On the following day the 373d was transferred to Sioux Falls Army Air Field. South Dakota. The group's stay at that base was short, for on 17 August it moved to Seymour- Johnson Field, North Carolina, and then to Mitchel Field, New York, on 28 September. Less than two months later, on 7 November 1945, the 373d Fighter Group was inactivated. The group emblem was an \\"unofficial\\" type but was carried on some P-47s of the unit, also the squadrons had \\"Unofficial\\" emblems as well. The World War II-era emblem was a shield with a checkered upper right portion and a bar dividing the shield from top left to lower right and a solid color in the lower left portion. =Lineage= * Constituted as 373d Fighter Group on 25 May 1943 : Activated on 15 August 1943 : Inactivated on 7 November 1945 =Assignments= * I Fighter Command, 15 August 1943 ‚Äì 15 March 1944 : Attached to: New York Fighter Wing, 23 October 1943 ‚Äì 15 March 1944 * 303d Fighter Wing : Attached to: XIX Tactical Air Command, 4 April 1944 * Second Air Force, 4 August 1945 * First Air Force, 20 August ‚Äì 7 November 1945 =Stations= * Westover Field, Massachusetts, 15 August 1943 * Norfolk Airport, Virginia, 23 October 1943 * Richmond Army Air Base, Virginia, 15 February ‚Äì 15 March 1944 * RAF Woodchurch (AAF-419), England, 4 April ‚Äì 4 July 1944 * Tour-en-Bessin Airfield (A-13), France, 19 July 1944 * Saint James Airfield (A-29), France, 19 August 1944 * Reims/Champagne Airfield (A-62), France, 19 September 1944 * Le Culot Airfield (A-89), Belgium, 22 October 1944 * Venlo Airfield (Y-55), Netherlands, 11 March 1945 * Lippstadt Airfield (Y-98), Germany, 20 April 1945 * AAF Station Illesheim, Germany, 20 May‚ÄìJuly 1945 * Sioux Falls Army Air Field, South Dakota, 4 August 1945 * Seymour Johnson Field, North Carolina, 20 August 1945 * Mitchel Field, New York, 28 September ‚Äì 7 November 1945 =Components= * 410th Fighter Squadron, 15 August 1943 ‚Äì 7 November 1945 * 411th Fighter Squadron, 15 August 1943 ‚Äì 7 November 1945 * 412th Fighter Squadron, 15 August 1943 ‚Äì 7 November 1945 =Aircraft= * P-47 Thunderbolt, 1943‚Äì1945 References * Maurer, Maurer (1983).

The equipment consists of a bat and a tennis ball that has had its outer layer burned or worn off. The rules come from baseball and are modified to fit the situation, i.e. whether it is played indoors or outside. Fuzzball can be played by as few as two players; outside of leagues in St. Louis, the Bevo Area Fuzzball League and the St. Louis Metro Fuzzball League and the annual Kearns Park Fuzzball Tournament of Champions, it exists as a pickup game, which has been successfully transplanted to \\"players leagues\\" which play a quasi-legal, quasi-outlaw version in Philadelphia and Northern California (San Jose and Santa Cruz, specifically). There are also fully official organized leagues for indoor fuzzball in St. Louis. Interest in the game was waning, however, at the turn of the century: by 2004, most serious players were in their 40s, with a decreasing number of new players becoming interested. Many St. Louis locals consider fuzzball to be a minor league training ground for future corkball players. History Fuzzball developed from the forms of bottlecaps and corkball that were played in St. Louis in the 1920s and 1930s. Fuzzball Nation has hosted a tournament in South St. Louis County since 1982 every Labor Day weekend. John Enger serves as the commissioner. Game play Fuzzball rules follow the same general rule structure as baseball, with the finer details varying considerably by region. The one consistent difference between fuzzball and baseball is the use of a tennis ball instead of a baseball. Players may or may not use a baseball glove while fielding. Indoor fuzzball is usually played inside of a large net with no base runners. Outdoor fuzzball can be played either on paved school playgrounds (typically marked off for kickball) or on a baseball or softball field. Serious players will also use a cigarette lighter or a blowtorch to burn the felt off of the ball, thereby making it much faster when pitched. Bats may consist of broom handles, baseball bats, corkball bats, or official fuzzball bats, such as those made by Markwort Sporting Goods of St. Louis, Missouri. Markwort also makes an official fuzzball for use in games. The batter may be out after one, two or three strikes. The batter may also walk after three, four, or five balls. If a batter is hit by a pitch, it can be worth two balls or the strike count may be reset. Once again, this depends on regional rules. If the ball lands behind a fence, on a roof, on a porch, or breaks a window far away it is usually ruled a home run. In some versions of fuzzball where space is a concern, hits are decided by how far the ball travels, in which case there is no running (similar to corkball). If small teams play, \\"ghost runners\\" can take the place of an on-base player who must go back to home plate to bat once more. Ghost runners move the same number of bases as the batter gets on a hit. For example, if a \\"ghost runner\\" is on second base and the batter hits a double, the ghost runner passes home plate and scores a run. Game length (including innings and outs-per-inning) also varies considerably from region to region. A popular version of fuzzball played in the western Summit, NJ suburbs involves nine two-out innings as well as a twenty-run mercy limit.

The dormant team was revived in 1926 as the Kitchener Dutchmen of the Canadian Professional Hockey League. The dormant name was revived in 1947 as the senior Kitchener- Waterloo Dutchmen, notable for winning Canada a bronze medal at the 1956 Olympics and a silver medal at the 1960 Olympics. The minor junior Kitchener Dutchmen continue the name today. Etymology \\"Dutchman\\" is a misnomer for a Germanic person, from Deutsch (German). This is even more so for Waterloo County, Ontario, as many of the earliest settlers were so-called \\"Pennsylvania Dutch\\". History The Dutchmen were one of the founding teams of the OPHL in 1907. Starting play in January 1908, the club would be a member of the OPHL until 1911.

It is now in the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas.Brown, Angela K., Texas museum acquires Michelangelo's 1st painting, Associated Press 2009-05-13, retrieved 2009-05-13 It shows the common medieval subject, included in the Golden Legend and other sources, of Saint Anthony (AD 251 ‚Äì 356) being assailed in the desert by demons, whose temptations he resisted; the Temptation of St Anthony (or \\"Trial\\") is the more common name of the subject.

On the basis of stylistic hallmarks such as \\"emphatic cross hatching\\", it was decided that the painting was indeed by Michelangelo. It was soon bought by the Kimbell Art Museum for an undisclosed amount, believed to be in excess of $6 million. Characteristics Giorgio Vasari in his Lives of the Artists noted that Michelangelo had painted St. Anthony after a print by Schongauer, and Ascanio Condivi recorded that Michelangelo had gone to a market to draw fish scales, a feature not present in the original engraving. Besides this enhancement, Michelangelo also added a landscape below the figures, and altered the expression of the saint. Legacy It is one of only four surviving panel paintings by Michelangelo, whom Vasari records as speaking disparagingly of oil painting in later life, and the only one, if the new attribution holds, from his adolescence. Schongauer's late-Gothic style is also in strong contrast with the rest of Michelangelo's oeuvre, even in his youth. The prints of Schongauer, just reaching the end of his short life when Michelangelo copied him, were widely distributed in Europe, including Italy.Shestack, no. 34 Martin Schongauer, The Temptation of St Anthony, c. 1470‚Äì1475 References Category:Religious paintings by Michelangelo Category:1480s paintings Category:Paintings of Anthony the Great Category:Demons in art Category:Ships in art Category:Paintings of the Kimbell Art Museum ","title":"The Torment of Saint Anthony"},{"id":"22787957","text":"Pitt Fall was a drop tower ride located at Kennywood amusement park in the Pittsburgh suburb of West Mifflin, Pennsylvania.

The story was written by Robert A. Stemmle, Curt Siodmak and Max W. Kimmich, who also presented the idea to this film to his colleagues. It was made at the Johannisthal Studios in Berlin and on location in Hamburg. The film's sets were designed by the art directors Artur G√ºnther and Willi Herrmann. The location shooting started on 7 October 1932, while the studio shooting began only two weeks later, on 21 October 1932. The final movie passed censorship on 22 December 1932 and made its debut just a day later in Berlins Capitol cinema.Kester p.299  Plot  During World War I, young Ellen Lange runs away from her boarding school in Hamburg, because she cannot stand its strict rules any longer, and escapes to her brother Rolf, who lives in Kiel. Rolf, a vice-helmsman by profession, is not too enthusiastic about Ellen's arrival, because he has to go to England by secret orders. So he tries to convince her to go back to her boarding school, and when they both separate at the station, he is convinced that she will do so. But Ellen is unwilling to give up her new freedom again, so she takes another train to Berlin instead. During the journey, she meets a young girl that promises to help her find a job in Berlin. She also provides Ellen with the address of \\"Aunt Jenny\\", a dubious lady who finally gets her a job in a music store. After her three months of probation, Mr. Hansen, her boss, orders Ellen to bring a precious violin to Copenhagen. He also provides her with a false passport, as Ellen does not have any identity papers. Only after her arrival at Copenhagen, Ellen learns that she has not only transported the violin, but also secret strategic papers that were stolen in Berlin. She also meets Erik Larsen, a German secret service agent who works under cover at the Lyra publishing house, that in fact is a centre of the enemy's espionage ring. After that, she decides to work for the German secret service to make up for her fault. As a first step, after returning to Berlin, she tells the German counterespionage about the music shop in Copenhagen, which is rounded up shortly afterwards. Then Ellen learns that the papers she smuggled out of the country lead to the destruction of her brother's submarine. Deeply affected by his death, she gives in to Larsen to take on to another spying order with him which leads them both via Copenhagen to London. When they are invited to a ball at the American military delegation there, Ellen manages to distract Colonel Stanley long enough for Larsen to search the colonel's desk and to steal important papers from it. But when the boss of Lyra publishing house arrives at the party, he recognizes her and gets her arrested. During a German airship attack, Larsen is able to free her again, but while the two are attempting to escape, in a final irony Ellen is fatally injured by the fragment of a German bomb.

Facts Catherine Lee‚Äôs husband Geoffrey Lee formed the company through Christchurch accountants, which worked in Canterbury, New Zealand. It spread fertilisers on farmland from the air, known as top dressing. Mr Lee held 2999 of 3000 shares, was the sole director and employed as the chief pilot. He was killed in a plane crash.

It published 12 Reports from 2002 until 2015, and was then renamed, and relaunched under a new mandate as the Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report, UNESCO, whose principal role is to monitor progress towards the education targets in the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. It has been replaced by the Global Education Monitoring Report. Background In April 2000 more than 1,100 participants from 164 countries gathered in Dakar, Senegal, for the World Education Forum. The participants, ranging from teachers to prime ministers, academics to policymakers, non-governmental bodies to the heads of major international organizations, adopted the 2000-word Dakar Framework for Action, Education for All: Meeting Our Collective Commitments About the EFA Global Monitoring Report The Education for All Global Monitoring Report was the prime instrument to assess progress towards achieving the six 'Dakar' EFA goals to which over 160 countries committed themselves in 2000. It tracked progress, identifies policy reforms and best practice in all areas relating to EFA, draws attention to emerging challenges and promotes international cooperation in favour of education. The publication was targeted at decision-makers at the national and international level, and more broadly, at all those engaged in promoting the right to quality education ‚Äì teachers, civil society groups, NGOs, researchers and the international community. Whilst the report had an annual agenda for reporting progress on each of the six EFA goals, each edition also adopted a theme, chosen because of its importance to the EFA process. As of 1 January 2016, the EFA Global Monitoring Report became the Global Education Monitoring Report (GEM Report), with a new mandate to monitor the new sustainable development goal on education (SDG 4). https://en.unesco.org/gem-report/ Aims and audience The Education for All Global Monitoring Report aimed to inform education and aid policy through analysis of the challenges facing countries. While the prime audience consists of decision-makers such as ministers, policymakers, parliamentarians and education planners, other groups such as civil society, teachers, non-governmental organizations, university researchers and the media are important. Data The 'UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS), based in Montreal, played a leading role in providing data for the report on students, teachers, school performance, adult literacy and education expenditure. The institute collects data from over 200 countries and territories, but serious limitations in data coverage make it difficult to monitor certain aspects of Education for All, from public financing to education. To improve and accelerate data collection, UIS is helping governments to strengthen their own systems and analysis capacities. The report also draws on data from national household surveys, specially commissioned studies and other sources. The report published quality-assured data, compiled so that statistics are comparable for the majority of countries, using the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). Not all countries use the same classification systems, however, which lead to discrepancies between national data and those published internationally. Differences also stemmed from national population estimates. To calculate several indicators, UIS uses estimates from the United Nations Population Division, which can differ from those published by individual countries. More generally, the quality assurance process entailed a time lag between the collection (and often the publication) of data by national governments and their release by UIS for use in this and other reports. Where possible, the report identified discrepancies and data gaps. Funding and organization The publication was funded in the majority by multilateral and bilateral agencies, and benefited from the expertise of an international Advisory Board. During its annual meeting, the Board discussed the scope and contents of the Report underway and provides advice on its future development. Each Report was developed over a 12 to 18-month period. It drew on scholarship and expertise from governments, NGOs, bilateral and multilateral agencies, UNESCO institutes and research institutions. Research Papers commissioned for each Report are available on the website. The final version of the Report was submitted to the Director-General of UNESCO on an annual basis and considered by the High-Level Group on Education for All, comprising 24 members, including government ministers, representatives of donor organizations, UN agencies and non-governmental organizations. Its role, as stated in the Dakar Framework for Action (paragraph 19), was to sustain and accelerate the political momentum created at the World Education Forum. The Report is translated into the UN and other languages so that its messages and findings may be shared.

James Porter affair Father James Porter was a Roman Catholic priest who was convicted of molesting 28 children; he admitted sexually abusing at least 100 of both sexes over a period of 30 years, starting in the 1960s. 101 abuse claims On June 16, 1992, following the Porter affair, Bishop Sean O'Malley was chosen to head the Diocese of Fall River. He was installed on the following August 11. While Bishop of Fall River, O'Malley settled 101 abuse claims and initiated a zero-tolerance policy against sexual abuse. He also instituted one of the first comprehensive sexual abuse policies in the Roman Catholic Church. Laicization of Edward Paquette Father Edward Paquette, who was dismissed from the Diocese of Fall River and stripped of his priestly faculties in 1963 after accusations of \\"improper behavior\\" with young boys, only to resurface a year later as a priest in Indiana and then in Vermont, was officially removed from the priesthood by Pope Benedict XVI.Ex-Fall River priest, alleged pedophile, defrocked Continued allegations The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests has alleged that the Fall River Diocese has not done enough to inform the public about allegations against a Maine priest who once served in the Fall River and Attleboro areas, but diocesan officials have said that they already have done everything the group is now demanding. Lawsuit against former Bishop In 2018, a judge ruled that a lawsuit against former Fall River Bishop Daniel Cronin, alleging that Cronin protected a priest who sexually abused two altar boys in the 1970s and 1980s, could proceed.https://www.southcoasttoday.com/news/20180329/judge-lawsuit-against- former-fall-river-diocese-bishop-cronin-can-proceed 2020 lawsuits In January 2020, it was announced lawsuits alleging sex abuse by nine priests and one church employment between 1947 and 1986 were filed against the Diocese of Fall River.https://www.masslive.com/news/2020/01/9-catholic-priests-1-church- employee-within-fall-river-diocese-accused-of-sexually-abusing-children- decades-ago-attorney- says.html#:~:text=Nine%20Catholic%20priests%20and%20one,Garabedian%20said%20in%20a%20statement.

Formal statement Specifically, Sophie Germain proved that at least one of the numbers x, y, z must be divisible by p^2 if an auxiliary prime q can be found such that two conditions are satisfied: # No two nonzero p^{\\\\mathrm{th}} powers differ by one modulo q; and # p is itself not a p^{\\\\mathrm{th}} power modulo q. Conversely, the first case of Fermat's Last Theorem (the case in which p does not divide xyz) must hold for every prime p for which even one auxiliary prime can be found. History Germain identified such an auxiliary prime q for every prime less than 100. The theorem and its application to primes p less than 100 were attributed to Germain by Adrien-Marie Legendre in 1823. Didot, Paris, 1827.

It derives its inspiration from organic and asymmetrical forms in nature, fashion and sculpture. The Trioba 2+1 concept won the 3rd place in the ‚ÄúStile Italiano Giovani 2008‚Äù International Car Design Exhibition at Turin, Italy. The exhibition was also part of the World Design Capital ‚Äì Torino 2008.  Interior space  The interior space is based on enhancing social interaction and focuses mainly on the third seat. From Shashwath's MA Automotive Design (Coventry University, 2006 - 2007) research and three seat user tests, it has been found that the following parameters affect social interaction directly and indirectly and these have been considered while designing the interiors: *Social space *Physical distance *Eye contact *Effort required to hear / be heard *Sense of importance *Perceived safety *Openness to communication *Comfort  Exterior  Once the seating layout was established the exterior was designed around it, hence designing inside out. The form is largely symmetrical and asymmetry is introduced in such a way that it does not hamper aerodynamic efficiency. The features include asymmetric body panels and bonnet, which creates interesting, highlights and provides space for boot and a spare wheel. The non ‚Äì driver side has an asymmetrical gull-wing door, which provides easier ingress and egress for occupants.  Power  This rear driven concept has modulated Li-ion batteries, which gives the freedom to use space behind the third seat in such a way that optimizes seating space within. The Power Control Unit (PCU) provides sufficient power to the rear wheels through the Rear battery (Power = 250KW) and transmission unit. Air-intakes are provided to cool the Li-ion batteries and large vents are provided at the rear for dissipating heat from batteries.  3-seat concept  Since 2000 there have been many 3 seat / 2+1 concepts launched by almost all big OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) in various motor shows around the world like the Jeep Treo, Renault Zoe, Wind, Nissan Urge, Pivot, Volvo 3CC Ford Reflex, etc. This clearly shows an upward trend for this new segment of cars. Moreover, research shows that one-child family is a growing trend all over the world and also the average occupancy in cars has gone down (The avg. occupancy per car in UK has gone down from 1.64 to 1.59 between 1985/86 and 2002/03).DfT ¬¨Focus on Personal Travel 2005 Looking at the rate at which our natural resources are getting depleted, it is ironical to build cars that over satiate our demands rather than meet our needs. This clearly shows the huge potential for the 3 seat cars in the near future.  Development  Once final sketches, renderings and package drawing was done a quarter scale clay model was done in 6 weeks. Later a mould was taken and an FRP model was created out of the mould. Further sanding, hand polishing, painting and finishing was made on the FRP model to arrive at the final model.

Its mission is: \\"to promote the value and reuse of greater New Bedford's historic structures through preservation, education and advocacy\\".WHALE - Waterfront Historic Area League. 26 May 2009 . The organization often promotes its cause with the words of one of its founders, Sarah Delano (President of WHALE, 1966-1982). Delano said, \\"if you bulldoze your heritage, you become just anywhere\\".McCabe, Marsha, and Joseph D. Thomas. Not Just Anywhere. New Bedford, MA: Spinner Publications, Inc., 1995.  History  The organization was founded by a group of concerned citizens in 1962, at a time when urban renewal threatened much of the city's history and architectural heritage. The original focus was on the city's waterfront district, a dense area of whaling era buildings suffering from severe neglect and disrepair. WHALE took on the preservation/restoration of as many as 20 buildings within the district's boundaries over the years. This became the organization's first neighborhood revitalization project and lead to the establishment of Bedford Landing Waterfront National Register Historic District. With WHALE's leadership, the district would later be designated, New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park. Over time, WHALE expanded to properties beyond this district, taking on preservation projects throughout the city.

The Hanseatic School for Life pursues an educational concept on the basis of the \\"situational approach\\", which UNESCO classified as a \\"... much needed world-class innovative effort in the field of education\\" and a \\"new standard of educational excellence for the world community of the 21st century\\".http://www.worldharmonyrun.org/thailand/news/2007/0222 Through family-like living and project-oriented learning, the children and adolescents gain skills which can give their life a positive direction. The intellectual father of the situational approach is the Berlin educationalist Prof. em. Dr. J√ºrgen Zimmer, who founded the International Academy for Innovative Pedagogy, Psychology and Economics gGmbH (INA) at the Free University Berlin. History Tsunami warning sign in Khao Lak Hanseatic School for Life, formerly Beluga School for Life, in Na Nai (\\"village in a rice field\\") near Khao Lak in the south of Thailand was founded by Niels Stolberg and inaugurated in October 2006. The aim was to help the children in Thailand who had lost their parents due to the tsunami in the Indian Ocean on December 26, 2004. Thailand was among the regions most affected by the natural disaster. The children live in family-like structures, similar to those of the worldwide SOS Children's Villages. Education takes place in \\"Learning Centers\\" on the premises. The focus of the school is no longer exclusively aimed at the victims of the 2004 tsunami catastrophe, but also at local children and adolescents in need. The former premises of a coconut plantation in the heartland of Thailand have been continuously developed since the opening of the school.http://www.lyra-kultur.de/html/tsunami-hilfe.html Currently, 150 children and adolescents live in the newly built village. The age of the children ranges from infancy through adolescence. The Hanseatic School for Life is open to the public, and since 2007 it has also been possible to temporarily live on the premises as a visitor.http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/hilfsaktion-der-vater-von-na- nai_aid_359394.html The first School for Life following the concept of Professor em. Dr. J√ºrgen Zimmer was founded in 2003 in the north of Thailand, near the provincial capital Chiang Mai. This facility focused on AIDS orphans, as AIDS had caused the death of many parents in the region and left children in utmost poverty. The School for Life near Chiang Mai is located a 45-minute drive away from the provincial capital on the farm \\"Suan Suo Fha Sai\\", which in English means \\"clear skies over beautiful gardens\\". Today the school cares for and teaches more than 120 orphans. Activity Partial overview of the Beluga School for Life campus The objective of the Hanseatic School for Life, and a distinguishing feature compared to similar aid projects, is the orientation towards the transfer of practical skills which allow the students to set up their own business in the future and thus to even create new jobs. The concept is based on the idea of \\"helping people to help themselves\\", and aims at lastingly reducing poverty. The guest area of the village, the Hotel Training Institute, serves as a learning center. At the institute, school graduates learn how to cater to vacationers and qualify for employment in the hotel business during a one-year training course. Six subject areas are offered: *Organic farming *Culture sensitive tourism *Nutrition and health *Body and soul *Cultural heritage and development *International communication The organization of the school and the education on-site are the responsibility of a total of 60 employees. Five of them are German nationals, the rest are from Thailand. Financing The Hanseatic School for Life primarily finances itself by means of donations and sponsorships. Legally the Hanseatic School for Life is operated by the charitable Hanseatic School for Life gGmbH. In October 2005, Thai Beluga S.L. Ltd. was founded, which acts as owner of the premises and buildings.http://www.beluga- schoolforlife.com/pdf/BSfL-Figures-Data-Facts.pdf The plan for the near future is that the project will be able to largely finance itself on the basis of proceeds from \\"culture sensitive tourism\\" at the Beluga School for Life, which began in 2007. As guests of the Hanseatic School for Life, culturally interested vacationers receive insights into life in Southeast Asia on equal footing with the Thai residents. To this end, guest bungalows have been erected on the premises. Awards On September 30, 2007, the Hanseatic School for Life was selected by the initiative \\"Germany ‚Äì Land of Ideas\\"http://www.senatspressestelle.bremen.de/detail.php?id=8742 as a \\"Landmark in the Land of Ideas\\".http://www.land-of-ideas.org/ In November 2008, the Hanseatic School for Life received a personal award from Willi Lemke, UN Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Sport for Development and Peace.

After what was seen as the battalion's failure in action in August 1916, however, the divisional commander removed McCrae from command and assigned him to a reserve unit.

The first part of the title refers to the song \\"Rural Route\\" (which is included in two versions) from his 2007 album Freedom's Road and the fact that Mellencamp's music and lifestyle have always been very rural in nature, and 7609 references that the set spans Mellencamp's entire recording career from 1976 to 2009. Said Mellencamp in the set's liner notes: \\"I started making records in '76, and the most recent track on the collection was done in '09. So Rural Route 7609; it's like an address. I thought it sounded cool.\\" The liner notes for On the Rural Route 7609 were penned by veteran rock journalist Anthony DeCurtis, who also wrote the liner notes for Eric Clapton's Crossroads and Billy Joel's My Lives. DeCurtis wrote a 4,500-word essay on Mellencamp, and Mellencamp provides track-by-track commentary. Summary This box set contains four discs and 54 tracks and each disc is set up as an individual album with common themes rather than being presented in chronological order. The purpose behind this set is to highlight Mellencamp's songwriting. While there are many standard album tracks included on the set, there is also quite a bit of previously unreleased material, although no new unreleased songs. Highlights include Mellencamp's newly recorded version of \\"Colored Lights\\" ‚Äì a song he wrote for The Blasters in 1985 ‚Äì \\"Jenny at 16\\", a demo which ultimately became \\"Jack and Diane\\", and recently recorded solo acoustic versions of \\"Sugar Marie\\" and \\"To M.G.

Turkey bacon may also be used as a substitute for bacon where religious restrictions forbid the consumption of pork. Preparation right Turkey bacon can be cooked by pan-frying or deep-frying. Cured turkey bacon made from dark meat can be 90% fat free. It can be used in the same manner as bacon (such as in a BLT sandwich), but the low fat content of turkey bacon means it does not shrink while being cooked and has a tendency to stick to the pan, thus making deep-frying a faster and more practical option. Alternative to pork bacon Turkey bacon is lower in fat and calories than pork bacon, but its lower fat content makes it unsuitable in some situations, such as grilling. As a lower fat alternative, it became popular in America in the early 90s. Turkey bacon is an alternative also for people who do not eat pork for religious or dietary reasons. When Beautiful Brands International, a company from Tulsa, Oklahoma, signed a deal with a Saudi Arabian firm to open 120 locations in eight countries in the Middle East, they had to substitute pork bacon with halal turkey bacon in their recipes at Camille's Sidewalk Cafe locations because Islamic and Jewish customs forbid consumption of pork and non-halal meat. Nutritional value Two strips of Butterball turkey bacon contain 3 grams of fat and 50 calories (32% of which from fat); turkey bacon from Louis Rich and Mr. Turkey contain 5 and 4 grams of fat, respectively, per two slices. By comparison, two strips of regular pork bacon contain, on average, some 7 grams of fat.

The museum, which is run by volunteers, first opened in 2004 housed in temporary premises known as 'The Stables'. The museum relocated to its present site, in the town's Market Square, in October 2009. The museum's collection of artefacts and photographs documents the history of the town and surrounding areas. History alt= Chesham Town Picture, from about 1760 The initial idea for a museum was suggested in 1981 by the late Arnold Baines a longstanding Chesham resident, councillor and local historian. The Francis Trust was originally set up to raise funds to restore a painting known as the Town Picture and having achieved this objective the Trust's volunteers took up the challenge to establish a town museum. However, despite much local enthusiasm progress on establishing the museum was initially frustrated by the lack of official support to generate sufficient funds or secure suitable premises. In 1991 the Town Museum Project was launched. Over a ten-year period from 1992, and in the absence of premises, a hard-working team created a succession of thirty-eight temporary displays in a dedicated cabinet in Chesham Library. A diverse range of themes were tackled including a number on Chesham's industrial heritage; several commemorating national and local events and anniversaries; one on non- conformist churches and chapels; and a series on the renowned worthies of Chesham, including the Liberty and Lowndes families. Alongside the exhibits talks and fundraising events were organised and a Friends' newsletter produced. Despite this with only limited funds available it remained not possible to secure a permanent home for the rapidly growing collection donated by local people.A Display Case in the Library - The History of the Chesham Town Museum Project - Charles Armour 2003 The Stables Chesham Museum's former home In 2003 the Town Museum Project was wound up but some of the original project members joined with the publican of the Gamekeepers Lodge in Bellingdon Road who offered temporary facilities in a stable block behind the pub.

There is a substantial social history collection, comprising over 700 photographs, oral and video recordings, objects and documents relating to such topics as: Chesham's unique history of religious non-conformity; the influence of the major families and other 'worthies' of the town; and the early days of some of Chesham's institutions, societies and public services such as the fire brigade and the cottage hospital. These themes are illustrated through the five permanent displays: Made in Chesham; Chesham at War; Coming to Chesham; Digging up the Past, and Remember Chesham. Chiltern Bears made in Chesham =Made in Chesham= There is wide variety of artefacts, including craftsmen's tools, manufactured goods and toys, reflecting the changing fortunes of its traditional industries; - boots and shoes, brushes, woodenware and beer brewing. Exhibits demonstrate the transition from cottage industries to ones carried out in large Victorian factories. Early on in the 20th century the town was the centre of diverse industrial activity. Among the vast range of products made were handbags, pencils, teddy bears, aircraft seats, flags and aluminium foil. Through its exhibits, which form part of its permanent display, the museum illustrates how these manufacturing industries first flourished and then, in the second half of the 20th century, declined as they were progressively replaced by new businesses relating to pharmaceuticals, information technology and engineering. Gas Mask =Chesham at war= The museum also has a growing collection of 20th century images recording day-to-day life in wartime Chesham; the impact on people and the town of the First and Second World Wars and those who left the town to fight. Displays include the gas masks that were issued to adults and children, the activities of Air Raid Wardens, and how the use of ration cards and the growing of vegetables became the way of life for everyone. =Coming to Chesham= The story of how people arrived in Chesham, over the years for many reasons described through images, interviews and memorabilia. For example, the upheavals that resulted from a rise in religious non-conformity, as evacuees during the Second World War, those who were drawn by the demand for skilled labour in the 1950s, and those arriving more recently from the Commonwealth. Old Photo of Chemist Shop =Digging up the past= Some of the results of archaeological investigations which have played a crucial role in unlocking the story of the town's past as well as topographical and mapping surveys are accessible. The museum has also displayed prehistoric artefacts from Chesham now in the County Museum, Aylesbury, including a Bronze Age bowl imported from the Alps. =Remember Chesham= Another important area of work, currently underway is the gathering of oral and video histories through the recording of reminiscences from those who are long-term residents of the town. Through audio-visual, photographic and documents the memories of local people reflecting, on what has changed and what has remained constant in more recent times. =Temporary displays and website= The museum has space for temporary exhibition space which changes each spring and autumn. The first of these at the new location in autumn 2009 exhibition was entitled Pastimes and Pleasure the story of entertainment in Chesham, from amateur theatre to radio and television.

Community museum Since its inception, the museum has undertaken conservation work and research. It has provided for educational visits, town walks, craft displays and put on exhibitions at other locations. However, the shortage of space and its location away from the town centre limited the activities of the museum. In the museum's business plan the trustees set out their intentions to create a fully-fledged community museum at the relocated site. By relocating to larger premises in the town's centre the trustees envisaged being able to stimulate more interest from town people and visitors in Chesham's heritage. Although themed temporary displays will continue to feature, increased space now permits permanent exhibits and a dedicated area for group visits with audio-visual facilities. There is also an intention to interact more fully with other institutions, such as Chesham Library, the theatre and other social and cultural groups. Management and funding The museum, which is a registered charity, is overseen by a board of trustees operating as an executive committee with overall responsibility for the management of the museum's collection and its activities. The collection is looked after by a team of volunteers.

He was born as one of a pair of fraternal twins. During his career he worked in cabaret, and in 1938-1939, he entertained Princess Elizabeth and her sister, Princess Margaret Rose at Buckingham Palace, which got him invited to numerous engagements to entertain the titled gentry of England. Crowther was also a founder, member and President of the Puppet Guild, and he made more than 500 puppets in his lifetime.The Encyclopedia of Witches, Witchcraft And Wicca, by Rosemary Ellen GuileyThe Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism by Shelley Rabinovitch, James Lewis  Introduction to witchcraft  Shortly before World War II Crowther met Gerald Gardner and his wife Donna at the Caledonian Market in London. Arnold Crowther became friends with the Gardners and Crowther frequently visited the Gardners' London flat. Crowther became very interested in Witchcraft after meeting Gardner, but was not initiated until eighteen years later. When they met, Gardner's coven was very averse to publicity, and was afraid that Crowther might use Witchcraft in his act.  World War II  During World War II Crowther entertained with the Entertainments National Services Association, touring throughout Europe and entertaining service men with his \\"Black Magic\\" show. During the war years, Crowther joined the Forces Entertainment‚Äôs Corps, and entertained troops all over Europe with his show \\"Black Magic.\\" The \\"Black Magic\\" show also included an African Basuto choir. On 10 November 1943, while en route from Tripoli to Malta, he performed aboard a DC 3 airplane flying at 4,000 feet. For a time during the war Crowther was stationed in Paris, France and there he first learned of what he would come to believe was an accurate representation of his past life as a Tibetan beggar monk. He and an officer went to visit palmist, \\"Madame Brux\\", who invited them to a s√©ance. After introductions the medium, \\"Madame Brux\\", conceivably went into a trance and mayhap began to communicate with a masculine spirit. According to Crowther's testimony, the spirit claimed to have been Crowther's teacher in a previous life, and was his guide in this present one. The perceived spirit reported that Crowther had been a student in a Tibetan lamasery, and he (the spirit) mentioned the name \\"Younghusband\\" and that \\"he\\" had been killed in a battle. However, Crowther reasoned that if he had been such a monk in a past life he would not have been reincarnated as Crowther in this one. But later, at a London exhibition of Tibetan curios, Crowther discovered that there had been a Colonel Younghusband who had led a military attack against Tibet in 1904. Crowther came to believe that in his previous life as \\"Younghusband\\" he had killed a soldier in the attack before being killed himself. Also, during his wartime travels he had met Aleister Crowley who he introduced to Gardner in 1947. Following the war Crowther returned to performing on public stage and then he met Patricia Dawson who initiated Arnold Crowther into Witchcraft, and later married him (see Patricia Crowther.) Spokespersons for witchcraft  After they were married in 1960, Arnold and Patricia Crowther lived in Sheffield and the both of them became prominent spokespersons for Witchcraft. Crowther authored in collaboration with Patricia two books, numerous magazine articles, and a radio series on Witchcraft. In addition to his collaborated works with his wife Patricia, Crowther's other publishing efforts include: Let's Put on a Show (1964), a how-to magic book that he illustrated himself; Linda and the Lollipop Man (1973), a book on road safety for children; Yorkshire Customs (1974); and Hex Certificate (late 1970s), a collection of cartoons which he drew on the themes of Witchcraft. His autobiography, Hand in Glove, was not published but made into a series by the BBC Radio and heard in Bristol, Sheffield, Medway and Leeds between 1975 and 1977.

It has been designated as a Grade I listed building. History Cannington Priory, later to be known as Cannington Court, was first established by the De Courcy family in about 1138. Many of the gentry of Somerset sent their daughters to reside there. By the fourteenth century, there was some moral backsliding and in 1328, an inquiry was set up to investigate illicit activities of monks and nuns. Large iron-bound gates were erected to ensure the nuns stayed inside the grounds, and there existed rumours that tunnels connected the nunnery to the village. The Cannington Nunnery built the adjacent Church of St Mary and survived until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536. The nunnery owned significant land in the area. Following the dissolution of the priory the building was bought by Edward Rogers and he made various alterations. These were continued by the Clifford family when they acquired it, particularly in the early 18th century. During the 19th and 20th centuries there has been some redesigning of the interior. From 1807 to 1835, Cannington Court was used by a community of Benedictine nuns who had returned to England following the French Revolution. After the nuns had left, the house was used as a Roman Catholic industrial school for boys. This was removed to Bath in 1917 where it became the Prior Park Industrial School. The Court then became part of the Somerset Farm Institute which later became Cannington College, and this was merged with Bridgwater College in 2004. Since then, there has been significant investment in the site, and a project to revive the walled garden has been undertaken. This garden was officially opened by Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex in 2009. Cannington Court is currently being leased to the energy firm EDF as a residential training centre. EDF have installed renewable energy sources such as ground source heat pumps and solar panels, to provide half of the building's power requirements. The house Cannington Court is a Grade I listed building, having been so designated on 29 March 1963. It is built of red sandstone with some brick sections. There is a moulded cornice and ashlar parapet with a coping. Some of the roofs are hipped; some are slated and others have Roman tiles. The range of buildings consist of a medieval hall and other buildings surrounding an irregular quadrangle, with a chapel wing on the south side. The entrance building has three storeys. The central, three-storey porch is made of ashlar stone and has slender Ionic columns on pedestals on either side. The windows have stone mullions.

Life and work Leonhardi was the son of the Minister Plenipotentiary Ludwig (Louis) Freiherr von Leonhardi and Luise, n√©e Bennigsen. He grew up in Karben and Darmstadt. He studied law in Heidelberg until he had to cancel due to sickness. Since then he lived in Karben. Moritz von Leonhardi is a nephew of the liberal politician Rudolf von Bennigsen. He worked as a privat scholar in Gro√ü Karben, from where he corresponded with scientists. Since 1899, encouraged by the novel publications of Walter Baldwin Spencer and Francis Gillen on Australian cultures, he connected with missionaries in Australia, especially to Carl Strehlow, missionary conductor in Centralaustralian Hermannsburg. Since 1907 Leonhardi engaged in the lively anthropological scientific discussion with the publication of the first volume of the Arrernte - and Loritja tribes. Amongst other things he was concerned with the acceptance and positive assessment of the existence of a high god of the Aranda. Leonhardi frankly opposed to Spencer and Gillen, who in his time were influential scientists. The contemporary discussion around 1900 was affected by a severe lack of acceptance towards the, according to the European view, newly discovered cultures of the Aborigines. Therefore, Spencer and Gillen followed the evolutionistic cultural anthropology of Edward Tylor and James Frazer. In contrast Leonhardi stood for a humanistic notion of anthropology in the tradition of Adolf Bastian and Rudolf Virchow. Leonhardi managed to confirm his claim for acceptance of the Aborigine-Cultures mainly in collaboration with Carl Strehlow and with a preciser handling of sources as the one of his scientific opponents. These texts constitute a possible base for political claims of the Aborigines in the 21st century. (Kenny, 65) Strehlows and Leonhardi's heavy critique of Gillen's and Spencer's absolutely wrong translations and interpretations, as for example translating the Aranda- word 'Alcheringa' into 'Dreamtime', still influencing today's popular literatur, is granted in latest researches. (V√∂lker, Nicholls) Due to his unsound health, Leonhardi never went to Australia. As an arm-chair-researcher, he was reliant on the collaboration with local partners. He had an agile correspondence with Carl Strehlow, in which he developed extensive questionnaires on topics like geography, language, social systems, marriage rules, totemism, initiation rites, monotheism, conceptions of soul, burial rites, clothing, adornment or ceremonial life. Monotheistic ideas were of special importance to him. Although Leonhardi published on Australian topics throughout his life, he acted out of a comprehensive anthropological interest, and worked on cultures in Europe, North America and New-Guinea. While making missionaries familiar with the technical terms and the doctrines of other scientists, sending them technical literature, commented by himself, Moritz von Leonhardi gradually dissolved the boundaries between informant and scientist. Thereby he allowed the missionaries to have their own scientific opinion. Also Leonhardi published the writings of the missionaries under their names, which was an unusual method for an armchair-researcher, to appear only as an editor and not as an author. Amongst discussions in terms of content, a controversy about methodological issues of data provision, field-research and scientific handling of sources was provoked. In the course of the exchange, Moritz von Leonhardi had brought ethnographic, zoologic and botanic objects to Europe and gave them to several museums, especially the Museum for Ethnology in Frankfurt am Main (today the Museum of World Cultures) as well as the Senckenberg Research Institute. Numerous Australian plants have been sown for the first time in Europe in a specially built green house in Gro√ü Karben, the grown plants are brought to their destination at the Research Institute Senckenberg in Frankfurt. Legacy and Honours Up to his death, Leonhardi couldn't compete with the well organized networks of Spencer and Gillen. With his early death, the German-speaking anthropological research on Australia came to a standstill for a longer period. His own network became anchorless because of his death and collapsed. Since then, especially Strehlow lost access to scientific discussions. The journal Leonhardi initiated and edited, containing the writings of Strehlow, was discussed by Lucien L√©vy-Bruhl (La Mythologie Primitive), √âmile Durkheim (Les formes √©l√©mentaires de la vie religieuse), Elias Canetti (Masse und Macht), and others. Lately a new reception begins. He was honored for his research, by the naming of the vespid Belonogaster leonhardii and the lizard Ctenotus leonardii Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

Philatelic activity Joyce was an active member of a number of stamp societies, including the Collectors Club of New York, where he was a member of the Board of Directors, and the American Philatelic Society. He was a founding member of the American Revenue Association and was also president of the Booklet Pane Society. Philatelic literature Morton Joyce acquired the Butler and Carpenter letter books and made them available to philatelic researchers, and, in his will, he bequeathed them to the Smithsonian Institution, in Washington, D.C. Joyce wrote numerous articles on the results of his studies of United States revenue stamps. In addition to authoring philatelic literature himself, he financially supported other authors and editors including the work of his friend George Townsend Turner in assembling Sloane's Column into book form.

As Governor of Lagos, his administration supervised the unpopular demolition of the Ajele Cemetery in the early 1970s. Early life and education Johnson was born to the family of Joshua Motola Johnson and his wife, Gbemisola Johnson (n√©e Dudley-Coker). His father was of Egba heritage and was a member of the Royal West African Frontier Force during World War.

In 1967 he became the First Governor of Lagos State. Johnson's tenure as Military Governor of Lagos State saw the building of major infrastructure in Lagos State. Governor Johnson was first appointed by Aguiyi-Ironsi as the administrator of the former federal territory of Lagos in 1966. Ironsi was the head of state and wanted someone from Lagos to handle some of the problems of the federal territory. In May 1967, Lagos State was created and Johnson became the first governor of Lagos; the state was now composed of the old Federal Territory of Victoria Island, Ikoyi and Lagos Island plus the additions of the Epe, Badagry, Ikorodu and Ikeja divisions. He was involved in developing the civil service in Lagos State. Johnson was initially assisted in running the state with help from some key civil servants such as Administrative Secretary, Adeyemi-Bero, Finance Secretary, Folarin Coker, and the acting secretary to the Military Government, Howson Wright and waited until April 1968 before appointing his commissioners. =Building Lagos= * 60.7-kilometre international express road (Lagos‚ÄìBadagry Expressway) linking Nigeria with the neighbouring countries Benin, Ghana and Togo.http://www.thisdayonline.com/nview.php?id= * Toikin Bridge to link Epe to Ikorodu * Eko Bridge * Third Mainland Bridge * A network of roads and bridges that constitutes what is modern day Lagos * Reclamation of the Bar Beach shoreline.

The committee was chaired by Dr. Benito F. Reyes and the members were Gabriel Formoso, Leoncio Monzon, Alfredo Morales, Vicente Albano Pacis, Jose S. Roldan, Carlos Moran Sison, with Atty.

The Senate version of the bill was spearheaded by senators Gil Puyat and Camilo Os√≠as, which was passed by the Philippine Senate in 1965. The consolidation of the two bills was tackled during the Fourth Session of the Fifth Congress, which began and was held in Manila on January 25, 1965.

For the fictionalized version, see Derfel Cadarn (Warlord Chronicles). For other uses, see Derfel (disambiguation). Derfel, known as Derfel Gadarn ([c]adarn: \\"mighty, valiant, strong\\"), was a 6th-century Celtic Christian monk regarded as a saint. Local legend holds that he was a warrior of King Arthur. Family Medieval Welsh tradition held that he was related to Hywel, a legendary Brythonic king of Brittany. He is said to be one of Hywel's sons in a late version of the genealogical tract Bonedd y Saint. Welsh tradition also makes him a brother of Sts. Tudwal and Arthfael (also reputed sons of Hywel), and a cousin to Saint Cadfan. Life Reputedly born around 566, Derfel is said to be one of seven warriors of Arthur who survived the Battle of Camlan. Three of the six other survivors were also said to have become saints. While others survived through good fortune, Derfel survived \\"by his strength alone\\". Derfel is said to have been a noted warrior in medieval Welsh poetry. Tudur Penllyn wrote: :Derfel mewn rhyfel, gwnai'i wayw'n rhyfedd, Darrisg dur yw'r wisg, dewr yw'r osgedd. :(\\"Derfel in war, he would work his spear wondrously, steel covering is the garment, brave is the appearance.\\") According to Lewys Glyn Cothi: :\\"When there were at Camlan men and fighting and a host being slain, Derfel with his arms was dividing steel there in two\\". After Camlan, Derfel is unanimously held in Welsh tradition to have entered the religious life. After a possible stint as a hermit, he is said to have entered the monastery of Llantwit. He was also associated with Llandderfel in Gwynedd, named after and said to have founded by him. He is also said to have served as the abbot of Ynys Enlli, Bardsey Island, succeeding his cousin St. Cadfan. He is said to have died of natural causes on 6 April 660. Veneration Derfel's feast day is 5 April. For centuries Derfel was venerated at the churches of Llanfihangel Llantarnam, which claimed a relic of him, and Llandderfel, which featured a wooden image of him; he was an object of pilgrimage at these sites. Derfel was depicted as a warrior in full armour riding a horse rather than as an ecclesiastic. The Llandderfel image was removed and dismantled by order of Thomas Cromwell during the English Reformation and used to burn a Catholic priest, John Forest, at Smithfield in London. This was held to be a fulfillment of a prophecy that the image would burn down a forest. Part of the image survives to the present day at Llandderfel. In fiction A fictionalized Derfel Cadarn is the main character in Bernard Cornwell's historical fiction/historical fantasy novel trilogy The Warlord Chronicles, retelling the story of King Arthur in Dark Age Britain.

It is part of the Monongahela National Forest and includes Mount Porte Crayon, the sixth highest point in the state. Known as \\"Roaring Plains West\\" to the advocates of a much larger area (15,138 acres) of proposed wilderness preservation, the RPW consists of set aside by the Wild Monongahela Act, which was made law on 30 March 2009. (There are also areas known as \\"Roaring Plains North\\" and \\"Roaring Plains East\\" not included in the WMA.) Along with neighboring Flatrock Plains, these areas comprise the highest plateau in the eastern United States. Geography 260px The Roaring Plains and Flatrock Plains areas include portions of Randolph and Pendleton Counties. These high-elevation plateaux, which encompass the highest sphagnum bogs in West Virginia, consist of vast expanses of rocky, tree-studded plains surrounded by rock outcrops and cliffs offering impressive views of the surrounding mountain ridges. Elevations range from 2,360 to and the area includes the Allegheny Front, the name for the Eastern Continental Divide in this area. The bogs serve to regulate stream flow at the headwaters for both sides of the Front. Recreational trails provide loops within the area as well as connecting to Red Creek Plains, Dolly Sods Wilderness and even further north to Canaan Valley. An average of 180 inches (15 ft) of snow falls on the area annually, affording opportunities for cross- country skiing and snowshoeing. Snow typically falls from early October into early May. Blizzard conditions can frequent the high ground above 4,000 feet from November into April making travel perilous at times. About 5.5 square miles (14 square km) lie at or above the 4,500 foot contour, making this the largest and highest flat-topped plateau in eastern North America. Ecology The dominant vegetation in the RPW consists of a mesic habitat with red spruce, mixed hardwoods and open brush terrain. Extensive and virtually impenetrable mountain laurel and rhododendron thickets are also present. (The former bloom spectacularly in late June with pink and white blossoms.) The seven known high-elevation wetlands (sphagnum bogs) provide habitat to rare plants and animals such as the snowshoe hare, bog lemming, bobcat and fisher. The area provides protection to the federally threatened Cheat Mountain salamander. Deer, turkey, black bear and other native animals are abundant.

Legal consequences of a charge-off While a charge-off is considered to be \\"written off as uncollectable\\" by the lender, the debt is still legally valid and remains so after the fact. The creditor has the right to legally collect the full amount for the time period permitted by the statute of limitations applicable to the location of the financial institution and the consumer's residence. Depending on the location, this period may be a certain number of years (e.g. three to seven years) or, in some places, indefinite. Methods of collection that can be used include contacts from internal collections staff, outside collection agencies, arbitration, or a lawsuit. United StatesTax regulations= In the United States, federal regulations require creditors to charge off installment loans after 120 days of delinquency, while revolving credit accounts must be charged-off after 180 days. The purpose of making such a declaration is to help support a tax deduction for bad debts under Section 166 of the Internal Revenue Code. In that respect it is a form of write-off. Bad debts and even fraud are simply part of the cost of doing business. The charge-off, though, does not free the debtor of having to pay the debt. =Effects on credit report= A charge-off is one of the most adverse factors that can be listed on a credit report.http://www.thetruthaboutcreditcards.com/what-is-a-charge- off/ It will then be listed as such on the debtor's credit bureau reports (Equifax, for instance, lists \\"R9\\" in the \\"status\\" column to denote a charge- off.) The item will include relevant dates, and the amount of the bad debt. This may make obtaining any unsecured or even secured credit more difficult. If the charge-off has been paid in full, it will be listed on the credit report as \\"paid in full\\". If settled for less than the amount due, it will be listed as \\"settled\\". Even such a listing on a credit report can be negative.http://financialplan.about.com/od/creditcarddebt/f/Chargeoff.htm =Effects on banks= As the number of charge-offs climbs or becomes erratic, officials from the bank's regulators take a close look at the finances of the bank. They may impose various operating restrictions on the bank and, in the most extreme cases, may close the bank entirely.

She delivers on those promises. Yet a raw and genuine agony pulses within and finally bursts through this sturdy framework, giving Ruined an impact that lingers beyond its well-shaped, sentimental ending. . . .

Biography Born in Bangor, Maine, Holden graduated from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1917. He saw service in World War I on destroyers based in Queenstown, Ireland. Lieutenant Commander Holden was given command of the destroyer in 1920. In 1922-1924 he took a master's degree in Electrical Communications Engineering from the Naval Academy and Harvard University, and spent the next ten years on communications-related assignments, including a posting with the Naval Mission to Brazil. He commanded the destroyer in 1932-34, and in 1935-36 was sent to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii as District Communications Officer. On the morning of December 7, 1941, Holden was serving as Executive Officer with the rank of Commander on the battleship when it was attacked and damaged by Japanese aircraft at Pearl Harbor. In January 1942 he was made Fleet Communication Officer on the Staff of the Commander-in-Chief of the United States Fleet, and was then appointed Director of Naval Communications in September 1942, replacing Joseph Redman. In 1943 he became the first captain of the battleship , a position he held for most of the war. In 1945 he was made Rear Admiral in charge of Cruiser Division Pacific, and witnessed the Japanese surrender from the deck of the in Tokyo Bay. He subsequently became Commander of US Naval Forces in occupied Germany, retiring from that position (and the Navy) in 1952. He was decorated with Bronze Star Medal for his service from August 1944 to January 1945 in Philippines and South China Seas and later also with Legion of Merit.

He was one of the founders and the leader of the Nepal Praja Parishad, the first political party in Nepal with the goal of removing the Rana Dynasty's dictatorship.  Founding of the Nepal Praja Parishad  Tanka Prasad Acharya was born to Tika Prasad Acharya and Tika Devi Acharya in 1912. Acharya met multiple other intellectuals seeking the end of the Rana dictatorship, primarily Dashrath Chand. In a hotel in Bhimphedi, Makwanpur District, Acharya and Chand came up with the idea to form the Nepal Praja Parishad (Nepal People's Council). They formed the group in 1936, after getting support from other pro-democracy intellectuals like Dharma Bhakta Mathema and Gangalal Shrestha. Acharya was voted the leader of the group. Dharma Bhakta Mathema was also the gym instructor of King Tribhuvan, and Tribhuvan explicitly gave his support to the organisation. The Nepal Praja Parishad took part in many anti-Rana activities. Initially, they handed out hand-written pamphlets to Nepali's, and wrote articles in multiple Indian papers. Eventually, Acharya brought a printing machine from India to Nepal, allowing them to print and distribute more pamphlets. The group became more extreme as time went on, and later, in 1940, they planned the assassination of multiple officials in the Rana government. However, they were discovered after someone informed the government of their plan. Acharya and many members of the group were sentenced to death, however Acharya was not executed, for he was a Brahmin, and the killing of Brahmins was not allowed under Nepali law at the time. Instead, Acharya was sentenced to life in prison. The Nepal Praja Parishad was effectively dissolved. While in prison, in 1947, the Nepali National Congress was formed, and Acharya was elected its president. However, due to being in prison and unable to communicate with the Nepali Congress, this was only a symbolic move, and B.P. Koirala became acting president.  Post-revolution political career  Following the 1951 Revolution, Acharya was released from prison and pardoned by King Tribhuvan. For a few years he remained a part of the Nepali Congress as a senior member, however, following disagreements with the Nepali Congress leadership, he split off with Bhadrakali Mishra, another senior politician of the Nepali Congress, and reformed the Nepal Praja Parishad. Acharya and the Nepal Praja Parishad were part of Matrika Prasad Koirala's government in 1953, and remained a part of the opposition to the dominant Nepali Congress. Tanka Prasad Acharya (left) visiting Beijing  Premiership  In 1956, King Mahendra made Acharya Prime Minister. During his premiership, the first 5-year plan was started, the Nepal Rastra Bank was created and the Supreme Court was established. Acharya's tenure was also seen as a golden age for Nepal for foreign relations, establishing diplomatic relations with many countries and working closely with the Chinese government, primarily seen through the signing of the Economic Assistance Agreement with them on 7 October 1956, with China pledging Rs 60 million to the Nepali government for development. Acharya resigned as Prime Minister in July 1957.  Post-premiership  By the 1959 Nepali elections, there had been a split between Acharya and Mishra in the Nepal Praja Parishad, leading them to run separately. Acharya's faction of the Nepal Praja Parishad won 2 seats, whereas Mishra's won 1. After King Mahendra's 1960 coup where he installed the Panchayat system, Acharya was arrested and put in prison. He was released the following year, though he made little political impact. Tanka Prasad Acharya died on 23 April 1992 due to kidney complications, aged 80.

Infection with D. mansonoides in humans can result in sparganosis. Justus F. Mueller first reported this organism in 1935. D. mansonoides is similar to D. latum and Spirometra erinacei. When the organism was discovered, scientist did not know if D. mansonoides and S. erinacei were separate species. PCR analysis of the two worms has shown the two to be separate but closely related organisms. General Characteristics Cestodes have a dorso-ventrally flattened shape. Cestodes are segmented worms, and their bodies are divided into three distinct regions: the scolex, the neck, and the strobila. The scolex is the head of the cestode, and it functions as a holdfast organ that is specialized to attach to intestines using a variety of mechanisms. Posterior to the scolex is the neck, which is an unsegmented, poorly differentiated region. The neck is where asexual reproduction of proglottid segments occurs. Proglottid segments are individual sets of reproductive organs that compose the rest of the cestode body. The most posterior section of the cestode body consists of multiple strobila, each being made up of several proglottids. There are 3 stages that proglottids go through in their maturation. The first proglottid stage is the immature stage, characterized by functional reproductive organs. The immature stage is the most anterior proglottid, and consists of anywhere between 200 and 300 proglottids. The mature proglottid is located medially to the other proglottids, and is reproductively functional and hermaphroditic. The most posterior proglottid is the gravid stage, and it is packed with eggs. These eggs are eventually released from the gravid proglottid either through a pore in the proglottid or by disintegration of the proglottid. Cestodes also have sensory organs in the scolex that detect tactile stimulation. The sensory organs are attached to longitudinal nerves that run along the body and are attached to organs. Distribution D. mansonoides is typically found in the southern US. It is especially common in Florida and along the Gulf Coast. D. mansonoides is found in freshwater. The eggs, coracidia and copepods (1st intermediate hosts) inhabit freshwater. The plerocercoids are found in the muscles of hosts. The adult stage is found in various organs (CNS, eye, muscles, etc.) of the definitive host (cat, dog, birds, and other mammals). Digestion/Metabolism Cestodes have no digestive tract, and instead, they absorb nutrients along their tegument, which contains microvilli and glycocalyxes. The microvilli are used to absorb nutrients. The glycocalyx is a fuzzy coat that absorbs host enzymes and inhibits host proteases. Life cycle *The adult dog or cat drops eggs, which hatch between 9 and 120 days. The coracidium exit the egg through the operculum, a cap in the egg. *The coracidium is ciliated and swims around in the water, where it is ingested by a copepod. *The coracidium then sheds its ciliated epithelium, penetrates the midgut wall of the copepod, and develops into the infective procercoid after 18 days. *The copepod is the 1st intermediate host. *The procercoid cause the copepod to be sluggish, making it susceptible to be ingested by a 2nd intermediate host, often a frog, snake, or mammal. *The procercoid penetrates the gut wall and enters the muscles or connective tissues. The procercoid then develops into the plerocercoid. *The 2nd intermediate host is then eaten by either the definitive host (the bobcat) or a secondary definitive host (a dog or cat). The adult penetrates the intestinal wall and enters the muscles, where it absorbs nutrients. *Humans can acquire the parasite by ingesting an infected copepod from drinking contaminated water or by eating infected secondary definitive hosts. Therefore, humans can act as 2nd intermediate hosts or paratenic hosts. Cestode Lecture, Spring 2009. Dr. Ravinder N.M. Sehgal. San Francisco State University, Department of Biology. Disease and Treatment Infection with Diphyllobothrium mansonoides results in sparganosis. Sparganosis is the development of plerocercoids in tissues. There are several routes of human infection: :*When a human mistakenly eats or drinks the procercoid-containing copepod, becoming the 2nd intermediate host. :*When a human ingests the plerocercoid-containing 2nd intermediate host (frog or snake). The human then becomes the paratenic host. :*When a human uses the 2nd intermediate host as a poultice on the skin, vagina, or eyes. A biopsy of the infected area is conducted to identify the pathogen. Surgical removal of the tapeworm is usually the best method. However, drugs like praziquantel can be administered to treat the infection. A study was conducted on free-range Florida panthers on the effectiveness of anthelmintic treatment. In the study, the intensity of infection of S. mansonoides increased 6 months after treatment instead of decreasing.Foster GW, Cunningham MW, Kinsella JM, McLaughlin G, Forrester DJ. \\"Gastrointestinal helminths of free-ranging Florida panthers (Puma concolor coryi) and the efficacy of the current anthelmintic treatment protocol.\\" Journal of Wildlife Diseases. 2006 Apr;42(2):402-6 References Category:Cestoda ","title":"Diphyllobothrium mansonoides"},{"id":"22789485","text":"The Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas \\"Rafael Rodr√≠guez Padilla\\" (National School of Plastic Arts) (ENAP), based in Guatemala City, is a public institution of higher education, research, and professional education in academic and applied fine arts of painting, sculpture, and graphic design.

This pattern uses a central registry known as the \\"service locator\\", which on request returns the information necessary to perform a certain task.http://martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html#UsingAServiceLocator Proponents of the pattern say the approach simplifies component-based applications where all dependencies are cleanly listed at the beginning of the whole application design, consequently making traditional dependency injection a more complex way of connecting objects. Critics of the pattern argue that it is an anti-pattern which obscures dependencies and makes software harder to test. Advantages * The \\"service locator\\" can act as a simple run-time linker. This allows code to be added at run-time without re-compiling the application, and in some cases without having to even restart it. * Applications can optimize themselves at run-time by selectively adding and removing items from the service locator. For example, an application can detect that it has a better library for reading JPG images available than the default one, and alter the registry accordingly. * Large sections of a library or application can be completely separated. The only link between them becomes the registry. * An application may use multiple structured service locators purposed for particular functionality/testing. Service locator does not mandate one single static class per process * The solution may be simpler with service locator (vs. dependency injection) in applications with well- structured component/service design. In these cases the disadvantages may actually be considered as an advantage (e.g. no need to supply various dependencies to every class and maintain dependency configurations) Disadvantages * The registry hides the class' dependencies, causing run- time errors instead of compile-time errors when dependencies are missing (similar to using Dependency injection). But each library is compiled, just the discovery of the concrete Class might not be found and cause an error, it's more a deployment issue than a Service Locator issue. * The registry makes code harder to test, since all tests need to interact with the same global service locator class to set the fake dependencies of a class under test. However, this is easily overcome by injecting application classes with a single service locator interface. Simulator can be implemented to simulate each interface provided by the service locator, so it's easy to swap the real implementation with a simulator.

It originally aired on May 18, 2009.  Plot  Future Ted (Bob Saget) describes the evening of his 31st birthday. Over the previous 3 days, Ted had been working hard to design a hat-shaped rib restaurant. As he pulls an all-nighter in an attempt to win his firm a contract, Marshall attempts to lure Ted to the roof for a surprise 31st birthday party, which Ted waves off because he thinks Marshall would never schedule two surprise parties in a row. Barney asks for Ted's blessing to pursue Robin, using an obvious analogy involving a suit. Disappointed at his inability to throw a good party, Marshall stands on the ledge of the roof, ready to jump from their apartment roof to the neighboring building's roof (beautifully furnished with a hot tub), about seven feet away. A flashback shows Marshall's attempts over the last years to get the courage to jump. Lily tries to dissuade him by falsely claiming that she is pregnant, resulting in Marshall saying that he noticed Lily gaining weight, and Lily storming off afterwards. Downstairs, while Ted is hard at work, the goat scuttles through the apartment. Ted calls Lily, anxious and annoyed at its presence. After he repeatedly takes a wash-cloth away from the animal, the goat mauls Ted, and he is sent to the hospital. Finally, when he shows up to his restaurant design meeting, his clients decide to go with Swedish avant-garde architecture collective Sven, instead of him. Meanwhile, Barney has decided to confess his feelings for Robin, but before he can say anything, she says that she loves him. He quickly reacts by saying they should just be friends, and picks up a random girl at the party. Lily then tells him that Robin overheard his suit analogy with Ted, and was worried about what to do. After discussing it with Lily and Marshall (who reveal they had known for months), Robin decides to \\"Mosby\\" Barney, telling him she loves him right away, just like Ted did. Barney discovers the truth, gets disappointed, and confronts Robin at the hospital. She admits to \\"Mosbying\\" him, but then tries to do it again, until the two confess their complicated feelings for each other and kiss. After this, they decide to discuss it later. Finally, back in the apartment, Ted laments his situation, and Lily tells him to stop chasing something that is not working, and let the universe take over for a bit. When Lily tells Ted that maybe he should just take \\"the leap\\" and do what the world seems to want him to do, Marshall takes the advice literally, and leaps from the roof to the other building, followed by the rest of the gang. Ted is the last to jump, and cheered on by his friends, makes the leap to the other building alongside them, and later accepts the professor job at the University. The episode ends with Ted, now Professor Mosby, in front of a class of students. Future Ted tells his children that despite being the year where he was left at the altar, knocked out by a crazed bartender, fired and attacked by a goat, it was the best year of his life.

It has an apparent magnitude 11.67, fainter than Proxima Centauri (mag. 11.05), the nearest star to the Sun. This star is located in the Monoceros constellation. Location and properties The star is located in the LRa01 field of view of the CoRoT spacecraft. It is about 500 light years from Earth. According to the project website, this field is in the Monoceros constellation. Published data lists the stellar properties as being a G9V yellow dwarf with a temperature of 5250 K, a radius of about 82% of the Sun and a mass of about 91% of the Sun. But other sources have been known to list it is a (K0V) orange dwarf. The metallicity is 0.12 ¬± 0.06. The star is estimated to be about 150 parsecs away and with an age in the range 1.2 ‚Äì 2.3 billion years, is younger than our own star which has an age of 4.6 billion years. The rotation period of the star, inferred by the lightcurve obtained by CoRoT, is around 23 days. Planetary system The star is reported to be orbited by the super-Earth extrasolar planets CoRoT-7b and CoRoT-7c, both discovered in 2009. The existence of a possible third planet CoRoT-7d, detected in a published study, remains unconfirmed. The discovery of the inner planet was made using the astronomical transit method by the CoRoT program. CoRoT-7b is notable for its small size. This star was reported to have stellar activity, making the confirmation process for CoRoT-7b more difficult. In fact, mass estimates are affected by large uncertainty due to stellar activity, that perturbs the radial velocity measurements needed to \\"weigh\\" the planets.

He is the patron saint of Bettona, in Umbria, and said to have been the first bishop of that city, although the dioceses of Nocera and Foligno also include his name in episcopal lists.Giuseppe Cappelletti, Le chiese d'Italia della loro origine sino ai nostri giorni (Venice, 1846), 398. According to a legendary Passio of the 12th century, Crispoldus was a native of Jerusalem and one of the Seventy Disciples; in 58 AD Crispoldus was sent to Italy by Saint Peter to preach Christianity there. Crispoldus traveled to Umbria and performed miracles at the town of Bettona. He was consecrated bishop of Bettona by St. Brictius (Brizio), who was bishop of Massa Martana. Britius is also named as a bishop of Spoleto and of Foligno. According to Giuseppe Cappelletti, Britius may have been a regional bishop, rather than a bishop of a particular diocese, which explains his association with multiple dioceses. Crispoldus began to preach Christianity in his diocese, but was arrested by soldiers of the Roman Emperor Maximian (250-310). He was tried before the prefect Asterius and invited to sacrifice to the Roman gods. Crispoldus refused, and was killed after being tortured. At the same time, a man named Barontius (Baronzio) was decapitated for being a Christian. Crispoldus‚Äô sister Tutela, along with twelve other women, attempted to bury Crispoldus and Barontius, but were arrested in the attempt. They also refused to sacrifice to the Roman gods and were put to death. Their martyrdom is said to have occurred on May 12. Crispoldus' Germanic name makes his connection to the Apostles unlikely and probably legendary. Veneration Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, where Crispoldus' relics rest. A church was built on the site of Crispoldus‚Äô martyrdom in what is now Passaggio di Bettona, a frazione of the Comune of Bettona. Crispoldus is mentioned in a document dating from 1018, found in the archives of Assisi Cathedral. The church of San Crispolto was built in the 8th century when the remains of the saint were moved inside the walls of the historic center. There the sliver and gilded reliquary bust of the saint resides in the transept to the left of the main altar. It was subsequently renovated in the 18th century with a brick facade by Antonio Stefanucci. Originally Benedictine the church was later given to the Franciscan Order. A new church, Santa Maria Maggiore, was built within the walls of Bettona in the 13th century, and was consecrated by Bishop Guido of Bettona in 1225. In 1266, the church became a Benedictine foundation and then became a Franciscan church. The church was restored in 1266 and also in 1797. The most recent renovation was necessary after damage from the 1997 earthquake that damaged the Basilica of San Francesco in Assisi.

History During the early years of the war, Warboys was a relatively conventional bomber station which was supplemented with the addition of an exceptionally long main runway measuring 6,290 feet. Construction of this runway resulted in the closure of the nearby road to Huntingdon (Church Road) during the war years, necessitating the construction of a bypass road, still in use (2015) as part of the A141. The extension to the runway is still clearly visible, on Google Earth, as crop marks between the old and new roads. The station was allocated to No.3 Group in August 1942. RAF Warboys became one of the original Pathfinder Force stations. The construction of Warboys began in 1940. The airfield was built to relieve the congestion at RAF Upwood for the use of No. 17 Operational Training Unit (No. 17 OTU) with Bristol Blenheims. The completion of barbed wire around strategic areas, and three AA gun positions with one Vickers gun, were almost finished by 17 May. The airfield was ready to use at the end of July 1941, and the first squadron to arrive was a detachment of Short Stirlings from 15 Squadron, arriving from RAF Wyton. The next unit to arrive was 'D' Flight 17 OTU which was based at RAF Upwood and came to Warboys on 15 December. 15 squadron left two days before 17 OTU arrived. The completion of the domestic sites and the new officers' mess and Sergeants' mess were in use about this time. Bad weather held up completion of a lot of the buildings including the Battle Headquarters. The first fully operational squadron to arrive at Warboys was 156 Squadron on 5 August 1942. The squadron came from RAF Alconbury with Vickers Wellingtons; in the new year it re-equipped with Avro Lancasters. The first RAF unit at Warboys was No. 1507 Beam Approach Training for the RAF Bomber Command, equipped with Airspeed Oxfords, but was only at Warboys from 13 March to 17 June 1943. After 1507 (BAT) left, the Stirlings, Lancasters, Handley Page Halifaxes and Oxfords of the Pathfinder Force Navigation Training Unit arrived from RAF Gransden Lodge. In January 1943, the base converted to Avro Lancaster bombers, which remained at the site until March 1944, when the aircraft were relocated to nearby RAF Upwood. Tests were made on the defence of the base on 31 October 1943 when the Home Guard, from non-local Platoons, attempted to take over the airfield but was unable to do so. The further strengthening of defences was made on 1 March 1944 when No. 2716 Squadron RAF Regiment took over ten Bofors gun sites. Upwood, which was still having problems with the grass runways, decided to convert to concrete runways, three in total. One of its first squadrons on the new concrete runways was 156 squadron when it left Warboys in March 1944. On 7 March came No. 1655 (Mosquito) Training Unit which had just come from RAF Marham. On 8 March, the A.O.C. of the Pathfinder Force, Air Comm. Bennett arrived to inspect the station and the personnel, The small Warboys airfield was getting very busy when on 6 October nineteen Lancasters of 428 squadron arrived from RAF Middleton St. George after operations over Germany, but by 12 December 1944 1655 (Mosquito) Training Unit left and went to RAF Upper Heyford. On 1 January came a smaller unit, No. 1323 Flight (Automatic Gun Laying Turret) from RAF Bourn. VE Day, 8 May 1945, saw big changes at RAF Warboys; the first was Navigation Training Unit that disbanded at the end of June 1945 but was replaced on 22 July by 128 Squadron with the re-equipped de Havilland Mosquitos from RAF Wyton. On 28 June arriving from Bourn was No. 1696 (Bomber) Defence Training Flight. 571 Squadron arrived from Oakington on 20 July equipped with Mosquitos. On 23 July the A.O.C. of 8 Group, AVM J.R. Whitley DSO AFC, came to inspect the station for the final time; he was very impressed. Warboys was coming to an end and it started with 571 Squadron when it disbanded on 20 September 1945; not long to follow was 1696 (Bomber) Defence Training Flight on 28 September and 1323 (AGLT) Flight was two days after that. 128 Squadron left on 8 October for service on the continent. With only a few communications aircraft left the airfield was strangely quiet. On 15 December 1945 Warboys was placed under a care and maintenance basis with its parent station Upwood. Over the following years RAF Warboys reverted to agricultural use. The buildings became derelict and the runways and taxiways were gradually broken up. Bloodhound air-defence missiles of 257 squadron were based at Warboys from 1 July 1960 with the return of the Royal Air Force. No accommodation was provided and the operating crews lived at Upwood, which had enough room. By the end of December 1963 the Bloodhounds had been withdrawn and the Royal Air Force relinquished the airfield for the second and last time. Airfield layout and additional buildings Located on the north side of the site was the battle headquarters bunker, defended by a pair of mushroom shaped F.C Construction type pillboxes (also known as Oakington or Fairlop type pillboxes), one of which remains in good condition in 2009. The airfield's bomb stores were located to the west of the airfield and to the north lay a machine gun butt, used for testing, discharge and alignment of aircraft machine guns. Domestic, mess and communal sites were dispersed to the south east of the airfield either side of the modern A141 on the borders of the neighbouring village of Old Hurst. At least 11 separate dispersed locations provided maximum accommodation for 1,959 male and 291 female personnel.

Post war In 1960, the former airfield became a Bristol Bloodhound air defence missile site, later withdrawn in 1963.

A small part of the airfield is now used by Ramsay Aero Model Club to fly radio controlled model aircraft.

His tales are usually set in the Southern United States and feature language and actions that are associated with those regions. Biography Ronald Kelly was born November 20, 1959 in Nashville, Tennessee and grew up in the small rural town of Pegram, Tennessee. He attended Pegram Elementary School in Pegram, Tennessee and Cheatham County Central High School in Ashland City, Tennessee before starting his writing career. He currently lives in the rural farming community of Brush Creek, Tennessee with his wife, three children, and a Jack Russel terrier named Toby. Ronald Kelly originally had aspirations of becoming a comic book artist and spent most of his high school years writing and drawing his own comic books featuring his own superheroes and characters. He also collaborated with classmate, Lowell Cunningham, who later became the creator of the Men In Black comic book series, which spawned several major motion pictures. Kelly began writing fiction during his junior year in high school, concentrating on horror, suspense, and male adventure. Between 1977 and 1985, he wrote several novels in the adventure and western genres that were never published. It was only when he turned back to his first love, horror fiction, that he became successful. He began his professional writing career in 1986 and quickly sold his first short story, \\"Breakfast Serial,\\" to Terror Time Again magazine. Between 1986 and 1996, Kelly's work was featured in the small press horror magazines of that era, appearing regularly in independently-published magazines such as Cemetery Dance, Deathrealm, Noctulpa, and numerous others. His first novel, Hindsight was released by Zebra Books in 1990. His audiobook collection, Dark Dixie: Tales of Southern Horror, was on the nominating ballot of the 1992 Grammy Awards for Best Spoken Word or Non-Musical Album. Zebra published seven of Ronald Kelly's novels from 1990 to 1996. Ronald's short fiction work has been published by Cemetery Dance, Borderlands 3, Deathrealm, Dark at Heart, Hot Blood: Seeds of Fear, and many more. After selling hundreds of thousands of books, the bottom dropped out of the horror market in 1996. When Zebra dropped their horror line in October 1996, Ronald Kelly stopped writing for almost ten years and worked various jobs including welder, factory worker, production manager, drugstore manager, and custodian. His hesitation to write horror fiction during that time was partly due to his religious convictions; he is a Southern Baptist and born-again Christian. In 2006, Ronald Kelly started writing again. In early 2008, Croatoan Publishing released his work Flesh Welder as a stand-alone chapbook, and it quickly sold out. In early 2009 Cemetery Dance Publications released a limited edition hardcover of his first short story collection, Midnight Grinding & Other Twilight Terrors. In 2010, Cemetery Dance released his first novel in over ten years called, Hell Hollow in hardcover. Full Moon Press had made a deal to release all of Ronald Kelly's previous novels in hardcover format with bonus material and a brand new added novella in each release. They were calling the series of books The Essential Ronald Kelly, but the deal fell through when Full Moon Press closed its doors.

It is dated to between 40,000 and 35,000 years ago, belonging to the early Aurignacian, at the very beginning of the Upper Paleolithic, which is associated with the earliest presence of Cro- Magnon in Europe. The figure is the oldest undisputed example of a depiction of a human being. In terms of figurative art only the lion-headed, zoomorphic L√∂wenmensch figurine is older. The Venus figurine is housed at the Prehistoric Museum of Blaubeuren (). Context The Swabian Alb region of Germany has a number of caves that have yielded many mammoth-ivory artifacts of the Upper Paleolithic period. Approximately twenty-five items have been discovered to date. These include the L√∂wenmensch figurine of Hohlenstein-Stadel dated to 40,000 years ago and an ivory flute found at Gei√üenkl√∂sterle, dated to 42,000 years ago. This mountainous region is located in Baden-W√ºrttemberg and is bounded by the Danube in the southeast, the upper Neckar in the northwest, and in the southwest it rises to the higher mountains of the Black Forest. This concentration of evidence of full behavioral modernity, including figurative art and instrumental music among humans in the period of 40 to 30 thousand years ago, is unique worldwide and its discoverer, archaeologist Nicholas Conard, speculates that the bearers of the Aurignacian culture in the Swabian Alb may be credited with the invention, not just of figurative art and music, but possibly, the earliest religious practices as well.√Ñlteste Menschenfigur der Welt gefunden S√ºdwestrundfunk 14 May 2009. Within a distance of 70 cm to the Venus figurine, Conard's team also found a flute made from a vulture bone. Additional artifacts excavated from the same cave layer included flint- knapping debris, worked bone, and carved ivory as well as remains of tarpans, reindeer, cave bears, woolly mammoths, and Alpine Ibexes. Discovery The discovery of the Venus of Hohle Fels by the archaeological team led by Nicholas J. Conard of Universit√§t T√ºbingen Abteilung √Ñltere Urgeschichte und Quart√§r√∂kologie pushed back the date of the oldest known human figurative art, by several millennia, establishing that works of art were being produced throughout the Aurignacian Period. The remarkably early figurine was discovered in September 2008 in a cave called ' (Swabian German for \\"hollow rock\\") near Schelklingen, some west of Ulm, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, in southwestern Germany, by a team from the University of T√ºbingen led by archaeology professor Nicholas Conard, who reported their find in Nature. The figurine was found in the cave hall, approximately from the entrance and below the current ground level. Nearby a bone flute dating to approximately 42,000 years ago was found, the oldest known uncontested musical instrument. In 2015 the team presented two further pieces of carved mammoth ivory discovered at the site that have been identified as parts of a second female figurine.. The venus and the fragment are shown in comparison here. Description The figurine was sculpted from a woolly mammoth tusk and it has broken into fragments, of which six have been recovered, with the left arm and shoulder still missing. In place of the head, the figurine has a perforated protrusion, which may have allowed it to be worn as an amulet. Interpretation The discoverer, anthropologist Nicholas Conard, said: \\"This [figure] is about sex, reproduction... [it is] an extremely powerful depiction of the essence of being female\\". Anthropologist, Paul Mellars of Cambridge University has suggested that‚Äîby modern standards‚Äîthe figurine \\"could be seen as bordering on the pornographic\\". Anthropologists from Victoria University of Wellington have suggested that such figurines were not depictions of beauty, but represented \\"hope for survival and longevity, within well-nourished and reproductively successful communities\\", reflecting the conventional interpretation of these types of figurines as representing a fertility goddess.

Background Upon the death of Margaret, Maid of Norway, in late September 1290, there arose a number of claimants to the throne of Scotland. The Guardians of Scotland were the de facto heads of state until a king was chosen. The late king, Alexander III, had been married to Margaret of England, sister to Edward I, and he was asked to conduct the court proceedings in the dispute, though not to arbitrate; the decision was to be made by a jury of 104 \\"auditors\\".Powicke, F.

When he demanded military support for his war against France, the Scots responded by forming an alliance with the French, and launched an unsuccessful attack on Carlisle. Berwick After the raid on Carlisle committed by the 7 invading Scottish earls (Buchan, Menteith, Strathearn, Lennox, Ross, Athol and Mar),Scalacronica p14 the English, under Edward I, began the initial conquest of Scotland in the first phase of the war. On 28 March (the Wednesday in Easter Week), Edward passed the river Tweed with his troops and stayed that night in Scotland at the priory of Coldstream. From there he marched on the town of Berwick.Prestwich, Michael (1997). Edward I. New Haven, US: Yale University Press. . Berwick was a Royal burgh just north of the border, and was Scotland's most important trading port, second only to London in economic importance in medieval Britain at that point. Berwick is referenced to be called \\"Alexandria of the North\\". Estimates also show that Berwick was, if not the most, one of the most populated towns in Scotland. Its garrison was commanded by William the Hardy, Lord of Douglas, while the besieging party was led by Robert de Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford. Contemporary accounts of the number slain range from 4,000 to 17,000. Women by some sources were spared. The English took the castle, whereupon Douglas surrendered and his life and those of his garrison were spared. The Battle of Dunbar crushed further Scottish resistance.

Built about 1670, it is one of Connecticut's oldest surviving houses, notable for its occupation by refugee Acadians following their 1755 deportation from Nova Scotia. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history The Acadian House is located in a residential setting just northeast of the town center of Guilford, on the south side of Union Street near its junction with Market Place. It is a 2 1/2-story timber framed structure, with a gabled roof, large central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade, oriented at an angle to the street, is three bays wide, with a central entrance framed with simple moulding and topped by a fourlight transom window. The windows on either side of the entrance are placed asymmetrically. The rear slope of the roof extends to the first floor, giving the house a saltbox shape. The chimney has an unusual T shape, the result of an expansion after the house was built. The oldest portion of the house was built about 1670 by Joseph Clay. Clay's grandson inherited the property in the 18th century, but vacated the house for a more modern one in 1726. The house has its name because a family of Acadians from Grand Pr√© were settled in the house following their 1755 deportation from Nova Scotia.

It was screened as part of the Un Certain Regard section at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. The film is composed of six whimsical yet blackly comic short stories, each one set in the late communist period in Romania and based on urban myths from the time, reflecting the perspective of ordinary people. The title of the film refers to the alleged \\"Golden Age\\" (by communist propaganda) of the last 15 years of Nicolae Ceau»ôescu's regime. Each episode concludes with \\"legend tells us ... \\", each item being legend because, of course, no such thing could have happened during the \\"Golden Age\\". Episodes The Legend of the Official Visit (Romanian: Legenda Activistului √Æn Inspectie) * Alexandru Potocean - The Secretary * Teodor Corban - The Mayor * Emanuel Parvu - The Party Inspector Local Party officials scurry into action when a motorcade of VIPs and foreign dignitaries promises to pass through the village. A government official arrives and attention is paid to the smallest detail, yet the people are let down when a phone call reveals the motorcade is no longer coming. With everyone disconsolate and the worse for drink, the official orders everyone to ride together on the children's carousel, but as the mayor passes out, they realize that there is no one to switch the machine off and get them down. Legend tells that they were all still trapped there when the motorcade did after all pass through. The Legend of the Party Photographer (Romanian: Legenda Fotografului Oficial) * Avram Birau - The Photographer * Paul Dunca - The Photographer's Assistant * Viorel Comanici - The Party Secretary Newspaper editors and Party officials fret over a photograph of Ceau»ôescu and the visiting Giscard d'Estaing to be published in tomorrow's paper. Much argument is had over how best to doctor the photograph to make Ceau»ôescu appear taller than d'Estaing, and whether he should be wearing a hat. Pressure is mounting as the deadline to get the paper out to the workers approaches. A hat is duly provided for Ceau»ôescu in the photograph, but no one notices until too late that he was already carrying one, leaving the image of him comically carrying one hat while wearing another. Police are sent out to retrieve all the copies that had been sent out. One copy is left uncollected on a train, and its reader laughs at the picture. Legend tells us that this was the only time that the paper, Sc√Ænteia, did not reach the workers. The Legend of the Zealous Activist (Romanian: Legenda Politrucului Zelos) * Calin Chirila - The Party Activist * Romeo Tudor - The Shepherd The audience at a large county level Communist Party meeting is told by an outside official that their county, home to four notables that he names, has an unacceptably low literacy rate in its villages and towns. He urges the young activists to spare no effort to remedy this disgrace. One such activist is next seen being driven out to a remote village until the washed out road forces him to complete the journey on foot over difficult territory. The first person he meets is a shepherd. He wastes no time establishing himself as a know-it-all, informing the shepherd that his cooking method is dangerous. He heads into town to meet the mayor, who offers various excuses, such as lack of electricity and the demands of farm work, for the poor attendance at the local school and other problems. The activist will accept no excuse insisting that all illiterate locals old and young must come in for class. Only a few children attend the first session when the activist insists that the mayor round up the adults. Some come, others, including the shepherd, send food items instead. A boy who has learned to read starts reading labels and warning signs to the shepherd, who ignores the information doing what he pleases as always. The activist, fed up with the shepherd's resistance goes out in the rain to get the shepherd to class. The activist stops to work on his shoe leaning against a power line tower. The shepherd, fed up with the activist's meddling, uses the pretext that the activist is being electrocuted by the tower to strike him with his crook. Next we see the activist, arm in sling, sitting on a cart loaded with food stuffs and chickens, while the mayor reads an appreciative farewell praising the activist and feigning sorrow at his early departure. On the way out the activist offers his hand to the shepherd who does not accept the gesture but hands him a bag of cheese to say goodbye and good riddance. Legend tells us that the next year the village reported a literacy rate of 99%. The Legend of the Greedy Policeman (Romanian: Legenda Mili»õianului Lacom) * Ion Sapdaru - Policeman Alexa * Virginia Mirea - Policeman's Wife * Gabriel Spahiu - Neighbor * Ingrid Bisu - Viviana A policeman is promised a pig by his brother, but when it is delivered, is found to still be alive. Uncertain how to slaughter a pig, and unwilling to share the pig with their neighbours, the family manage to gas it with butane in their apartment's kitchen. Believing the gas to have completely dissipated, they try to burn the hairs from its corpse with a blow lamp, but instead succeed in blowing up their apartment. Legend tells us that the family used what remained of the animal for the seasonal celebrations. The Legend of the Air Sellers (Romanian: Legenda V√¢nzƒÉtorilor de Aer) * Diana Cavallioti - Crina * Radu Iacoban - Bughi Crina meets small-time con-artist Bughi, who ekes a living pretending to be a water inspector: calling door-to-door, he asks residents to provide a sample of their tap water in a bottle they supply, which he turns in for the deposit. She joins him on one of his trips, but persuades him that collecting multiple air samples will be faster. They discuss how many bottles it would take to buy a car, if not a Dacia then the inferior Lastun. Their scheme unravels when they become overambitious and try to scam an entire apartment block out of its bottles. Legend tells us that with the end of Communism, Romanians bought Dacia cars with empty bottles. The Legend of the Chicken Driver (Romanian: Legenda ≈ûoferului de GƒÉini) * Vlad Ivanov - Grigore * Tania Popa - Camelia * Liliana Mocanu - Marusia A poultry truck driver, disillusioned with his loveless marriage, tries to win the heart of the manageress of a roadside inn. He brings her the eggs laid overnight by the chickens in his truck, but the two of them realize with Easter coming up, it would be more profitable to sell them on to the general public instead. Their scheme collapses when he is found out and jailed for embezzlement. He is eventually permitted a visitor to his prison, though it proves to be not the woman he sought, but his angry wife. Legend tells us that many Romanians were forced to steal to survive during the 80s.

The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The John Wilson House is located in the village of Jewett City, on the south side of Ashland Street at its junction with Hill Street. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, two chimneys, and clapboard siding. Its main facade has a slightly projecting center section, marked by two-story pilasters, a detail repeated at the building corners. A pair of doors are topped by an open gable pediment with heavy brackets. The interior has been altered in some significant ways to facilitate conversion to a duplex, including the removal of its original central chimney. The house was built c. 1781-82 by John Wilson, an early settler of Jewett City who married the daughter of Eliezer Jewett. Wilson was a significant early industrialist in Jewett City, establishing a fulling mill in 1790 and incorporating the Jewett City Cotton Manufacturing Company in 1815. His house, originally a center- chimney plan, was originally located up the street at the corner of Main and Ashland Streets. It was moved a short distance in the 1860s by Alfred Young, the agent for the Slater Mills, then the area's largest mill. It is the only surviving house associated with either man.

Biography  Yela G√ºnther working in his studio. Photograph by Carmen Yela. Yela studied sculpture under his father Baldomero Yela Montenegro (1859‚Äì1909), a sculptor and marble-carver, and afterwards under the Venezuelan Santiago Gonz√°lez (1850‚Äì1909). The Italian Antonio Doninelli taught him bronze casting techniques. In his early life he made the acquaintances of notable artists like Carlos M√©rida, Carlos Mauricio Valenti Perrillat and Jaime Sabart√©s. He was a member of the 1910 Generation in Guatemala Around 1921, after being disappointed of the Unionist Party that overthrew president Manuel Estrada Cabrera, and in which he had been actively involved in Quetzaltenango, he moved to M√©xico, where he met Diego Rivera and came in contact for the first time with Maya art and Aztec art through the famous archeologist Manuel Gamio. Over the years of Gambio's large anthropological and archeological project, besides Mexican scholars a group of intellectual from all over the world came to Teotihuacan and help him in several ways; Yela G√ºnther was one of them, working for Gamio from 1921 to 1925. In Teotihuacan, Yela G√∫nther worked in several tasks, working on the large Auditorium project, the museum murals and the sculptor known as \\"Tr√≠ptico de la Raza\\" (\\"Race triple sculpture\\"); regarding the Auditorium, besides building it, he was in charge of its ancient native motif decorations in which it is evident the influence that Diego Rivera had on his work. After completion of the building, Yela continued workin in Mexico for the old Secretariat of Anthropology ; about his work, Diego Rivera said that Yela G√ºnther was the best representative of the Mexican sculpture movement at the time. In 1926, Gamio was forced to leave Mexico due to serious accusations that he had been bribing his superiors; he left for New York City and then, thanks to Yela -who had come along as his private secretary- moved to Guatemala City where he worked on the ruins of Kaminal Juy√∫. In that mayan city they made several stratigraphic wells that were later used by Alfred Kidder to work on the systematic excavation of the site. From 1927 to 1930 the lived in the United States, where the worked with Edgar Lee Hewett, who had already worked in Guatemala in the Quirigu√° Maya site between 1910 and 1913 and who had been a mentor to other famous archeologist such as Sylvanus Morley and Kidder. In 1930, Yela G√ºnther went back to M√©xico as the cultural attach√© of the Guatemalan Embassy and in 1935, the government of general Jorge Ubico appointed him as director of the Plastic Arts Academy ¬´Rafael Rodr√≠guez Padilla¬ª where he worked until his death in 1942.Yela G√ºnther, Rafael, Literatura Guatemalteca. Regarding his relationship with president Ubico there are diverse opinions; while Ubico was a despotic leader that did not tolerate any opposition but that was in search of all kinds of contemporary culture -such as Mexican Muralism at the time-, and Yela -after having spent a few years with Gamio- was more inclined to the ideals of the Mexican Revolution, art was one of the few means by which a Guatemalan could earn a decent living at the time.

As a pop pioneer, he wrote The Village Stompers' international hit \\"Washington Square\\" and produced The GoldeBriars, Curt Boettcher's original Sunshine Pop singing group. Early years Bobb Goldsteinn was born in Philadelphia, where he attended Overbrook High School and Temple University.Philadelphia Daily News, October 18, 1966 He began writing songs while still in junior high school and continued through college. In 1958, he won an audition to write songs and sketches at the Tamiment Playhouse in the Pocono Mountains of Eastern Pennsylvania. At Tamiment, his sketch-writing partner was Woody Allen and his songwriting partner was Billy Goldenberg.Rex Weiner, \\"Bobb-ing and Weaving,\\" Variety, June 10‚Äì16, 1996 Midway through the summer season of 1958, Goldsteinn discovered that his songs were being especially well received and decided to work as a solo songwriter after Tamiment. He moved to New York City shortly thereafter and became an assistant to Burt Shevelove. A social encounter with songwriter John Gluck Jr. in 1959 led to Bobb's introduction to the legendary Brill Building, then the heart of America's Tin Pan Alley, where Goldsteinn and Gluck soon began peddling their tunes. They had little success and Bobb decided to move back to Philadelphia to concentrate on mastering the craft of theatre songwriting. Within a year, he had created a body of original material and recorded a revue of topical sketches and songs called \\"Present Tense\\" (with songs by Goldsteinn and sketches by Woody Allen). At the same time, Bob Sour (the President of BMI) and Allan Becker (the head of BMI's music theatre department) heard of Goldsteinn's work and invited him back to New York to join the first class of writers at the innovative BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theater Workshop. After returning to New York in 1960, Bobb continued working with John Gluck and the duo was discovered by Jerry Leiber of Leiber and Stoller Music. Goldsteinn and Gluck were signed on as staff writers, just as Ellie Greenwich was a while later (who had also met Leiber through John Gluck). Unfortunately, only one record from that period bears Goldsteinn's name: ‚ÄúThe Other Girls‚Äù ‚Äì the ‚ÄòB‚Äô side of Jay and the Americans‚Äô first 45 single, backed with ‚ÄúTonight‚Äù from ‚ÄúWest Side Story.‚Äù \\"Washington Square\\" In 1962, Goldsteinn took a song called \\"India,\\" which he had written as a high school student, and renamed it \\"Washington Square.\\" He created a distinctive arrangement for the tune called \\"folk-dixie,\\" an instrumental style that synthesized folk, jazz and Dixieland and represented the first hyphenated arrangement in pop music.John S. Wilson, \\"Folk Music and Dixieland Jazz Blended in Popular Hit Record,\\" The New York Times, October 31, 1963. \\"Washington Square,\\" as recorded by the Village Stompers, became a chart-topper across the world in 1963 and 1964, reaching No. 2 in the United States and holding the No. 1 spot on the Japanese charts for six months. In Japan, the recording sold over 800,000 copies and earned a Gold Record from the Recording Industry Association of Japan by June 1964; it held the record for best-selling album and single until it was surpassed by Michael Jackson's Thriller 19 years later.\\"The Village Stompers,\\" The Japan Times, June 5, 1964. In 1964, the song was nominated for two Grammy Awards - Best Instrumental Arrangement and Best Instrumental Theme. In the following years, the song would be recorded by The Ames Brothers, the Kirby Stone Four, Percy Faith, Lawrence Welk, Kenny Ball, Spike Jones, James Last, Andre Kostelanetz, Kai Winding, The Ventures, and The Dukes of Dixieland (among many others). In late 1964, Goldsteinn started managing, producing and co-writing for the GoldeBriars. Among his most significant lyrical contributions were \\"Sea of Tears,\\" which he co-wrote with Curt Boettcher, \\"June Bride Baby\\" with Beverly Ross, and \\"Tell it to the Wind\\" with Jeff Barry. \\"Lightworks\\" and Multimedia In 1965, when the GoldeBriars disbanded, Goldsteinn turned his attention to further developing the field of \\"colour music.\\" That year, he hosted a Christmas party for his friends, which he called \\"Bob Goldstein‚Äôs Lightworks.\\" In his Greenwich Village studio, Bob created an environmental visual jukebox that illustrated music by surrounding the spectator with manually synchronized light effects, slides, films, moving screens, and curtains of light under mirror balls that kept the room in spin.Eugenia Sheppard, \\"A Wham to the Senses,\\" New York Herald Tribune, March 21, 1966Thomas Meehan, \\"The Wiggy Scene,\\" The Saturday Evening Post, October 22, 1966. Year 239. No. 22. Word soon spread about the show's pioneering style (Life magazine referred to the parties as \\"the seedbed of new sound and light concept,\\" Women's Wear Daily proclaimed that \\"'Lightworks' may well replace the discotheque, movies, TV, and everything else!\\", and the New York Herald Tribune explained that \\"Bob Goldstein has managed to put into workable form something that lots of people have been reaching for... The problem for a long time has been to appeal to more than one of the senses at the same time\\") and the presentation became a continual happening, held both in New York City and in Southampton, Long Island at L‚ÄôOursin.Albert Goldman, Freakshow: Misadventures in the Counterculture, 1959-1971, New York: Cooper Square Press, 2001.LIFE Magazine, May 27, 1966, Vol. 60, No. 21, p. 73Ted James Jr., \\"Something New,\\" Women's Wear Daily, January 21, 1966.Eugenia Sheppard, \\"A Wham to the Senses,\\" New York Herald Tribune, March 21, 1966.Leo Lerman, Mademoiselle, September 1966, Vol. 63, No. 5 In 1966, Albert Goldman profiled Goldsteinn in New York Magazine, and said of his experience at L'Oursin: \\"After tuning my senses to the stunning melange of sights and sounds coming from every direction, I made a snap decision to stay there the rest of my life.\\" Lightworks even inspired the term \\"multimedia\\" ‚Äî a word coined by Goldsteinn to describe the technical nature of his entertainment and popularized by articles in Variety, Newsday, and other publications.Joseph Gelmis, \\"Modesty Blaise Previews in a Juke Box,\\" Newsday, August 8, 1966Richard Albarino, \\"Goldstein's LightWorks at Southhampton,\\" Variety, August 10, 1966. Vol. 213, No. 12. Goldsteinn's multimedia work was recognized as an important influence on art, cinema, advertising, fashion, and retail display. The first commercial application of the concept was designed and produced by Goldsteinn himself at Henri Bendel's in New York in 1966. For that year's Christmas season, Goldsteinn designed a first-floor display based on the ‚ÄúChristmas on the Thames‚Äù scene in Virginia Woolf‚Äôs Orlando: A Biography. The Lightworks-inspired set included 70,000 hand-painted bulbs that ‚Äúdimmed up and dimmed down to the groovy beat of records played by a full-time dee-jay‚Äù and was called a ‚Äúcourageous‚Äù departure from the traditional Christmas Trees and Santa Clauses of holiday decorations by the New York World Journal Tribune.Eugenia Sheppard, \\"A New Fashioned Yule\\", World Journal Tribune, November 23, 1966, p. 10 Lester Gaba, a renowned retail display designer and a partner of Vincente Minnelli, raved about the ‚ÄúChriscotheque‚Äù at Bendel's ‚Äì calling it ‚Äúthe nouvelle spell of Christmas 1966‚Äù.Lester Gaba, Women's Wear Daily, November 29, 1966, p. 13 Finally, Goldsteinn's identity as an important influence on the art world in general was solidified by his inclusion in Fluxus founder, George Maciunas's \\"Expanded Arts Diagram\\" as an \\"Expanded Cinema\\" pioneer in 1989. The \\"Lightworks\\" name was appropriated by Helena Rubenstein to brand a new line of youthful cosmetics. While the line featured a handful of products that were imagined and created without Goldsteinn's input, the Rubenstein Company allowed him to produce a radio commercial that was an audio counterpart of the psychedelic posters announcing the contemporary rock bills at various venues around the country. The radio spot featured spoken copy delivered over a singer and a music track, written by Bob Kessler. This simultaneous combination of copy and song had never been done before. Bobb hired Ellie Greenwich to do the singing, and selected Jim Morrison as the announcer. Unfortunately, the ad agency that handled the line had never heard of either Morrison or The Doors, and they nixed him. In the fall of 1968, Goldsteinn returned to songwriting and crafted the lyrics for \\"Canterbury Road\\" to a melody by Curt Boettcher and friends. The song was written for pop singer Lou Christie and while it was not formally released, Roy Hallee made a copy of the mix and took it to Paul Simon; a few months later, \\"Bridge over Troubled Water\\" appeared. All master tape copies of \\"Canterbury Road\\" disappeared until 1990-1991, when an in-flight audiotape was found in a Dutch flea market. The song was finally released on a Lou Christie import album called Glory River in 1992. Between 1969 and 1972, Goldsteinn collaborated with Andy Warhol on a number of projects. First, he wrote the title track to Warhol's movie Lonesome Cowboys, a track that is now known to be the first disco arrangement in music history. Goldsteinn also conceived the cover of The Rolling Stones‚Äô Sticky Fingers album, originally designed to be the cover of the Lonesome Cowboys LP. This record was to contain a dozen new compositions, all ‚Äòinspired‚Äô by the title song, but the label went under before the project could be completed and released. Finally, Goldsteinn ran the Lightworks equipment as the mise en scene in the opening scene of Warhol's film Trash. Stripper Jeri Miller attempts to fellate the star, Joe Dallesandro, as Goldsteinn's screens, curtains of lights and mirror balls play in the background. In 1972, Goldsteinn created a Lightworks retrospective entitled \\"The Strange Festival\\" that featured all of his sequences arranged into a narrative form, illustrating the central chapters of the French classic Le Grand Meaulnes.Michael Smith, \\"The Strange Festival,\\" Village Voice, December 28, 1972. Ernest Leogrande, writing for the New York Daily News, reported that \\"for two hours, curtains of lights move back and forth, screens roll up and down, mirrored balls revolve overhead, images appear and fade, blending into one another, music plays and there is both beauty and humor with a Goldstein concert of his own songs at the end.\\"Ernest Leogrande, \\"Merry Extended Christmas,\\" New York Daily News, January 13, 1973. California Schooling In 1974, Goldsteinn left for California in order to continue his education at Los Angeles Pierce College. He studied music, photography, and law, and graduated with an Associates degree from Los Angeles City College in 1982. While at Pierce, he studied music theory with the prolific composer, Rowan Taylor and was one of the winners of Radio KWST LA Soundtrack Record Competition with the song \\"San Fernando Valley Valerie\\" In 1980, Goldsteinn went to Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado to study Buddhism. During this time, Goldsteinn participated in a number of small projects as a favor to friends and acquaintances (including a brief co-venture with the pioneering gay adult magazine publisher Don Embinder), but he was making a concerted effort to stay out of the entertainment business and intended to do so until he felt ready to return. Return to Entertainment In 1987, Goldsteinn was summoned back to New York for family reasons and, at the suggestion of Johnson Burtt, a future business partner, decided to re-enter the industry. That year, he was invited to join the Board of Directors at Theatre Off Park, which produced shows like \\"Mademoiselle Colombe\\" starring Tammy Grimes under his tenure. During his first year back in New York, Goldsteinn was also heavily involved in the production of the 1st benefit for Bailey House, a hospice for homeless people with AIDS. ‚ÄúThat's What Friends Are For‚Äù at the fabled Village Gate was an all-star evening of cabaret featuring two dozen stars, including Larry Kert, Julie Wilson, Margaret Whiting and Jack Wrangler. California, Again By 1990, Goldsteinn became dissatisfied with work in New York and decided to return once again to California. In Los Angeles, he began an entertainment company, gOLDbURTT Media, with his former neighbor, Johnson Burtt. The company was initially confronted with failure, when it was removed from a commission to orchestrate the domestic release of Impromptu the first movie directed by James Lapine.Rex Weiner, \\"Bobb-ing an Weaving\\", Variety, June 10‚Äì16, 1996 However, the company roared back immediately when Goldsteinn promoted \\"The Strippers' Hall of Fame\\"‚Äîa sensational reunion event featuring a collection of elderly ecdysiasts which prompted TV crews from around the world to descend en masse upon a dilapidated motel in the Antelope Valley, between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. gOLDbURT Media was dissolved in 1993 due to financial and personal hardships that befell the company. That year, Goldsteinn was asked by Albert Brenner's daughter, Faye, to manage and stage an all-female a cappella group called The Joy of Six. The group made its first stage appearance in front of an audience at The Harmony Sweepstakes Southern California Regionals and won First Prize. The group was offered thousands of dollars in bookings, but the women decided that they did not want to spend their lives on the road and disbanded after the San Francisco Finals were held a month later. In 1995, Goldsteinn completed two high-profile art projects in quick succession. First, he designed the print teaser for \\"David Lynch Presents CRUMB\\", a documentary about Robert Crumb, for which Goldsteinn was nominated for a Key Art Award from The Hollywood Reporter.\\"The Hollywood Reporter 25th Annual Key Art Awards\\" Program, 1996, pp. 66 Then, in 1996, he created what he considers to be his graphic masterwork: \\"The 'Hollywood Boulevard' Street Sign\\". The billboard, unveiled by Robert Downey Sr. the night of the Hollywood Christmas Parade, is presented in a landscape format, where the words \\"Hollywood\\" and \\"Boulevard\\" are placed atop one another to spell out the word \\"OLD\\" with the letters that they share in common (a subcutaneous nod to the history of a street that rivals Broadway in legend). New York, Again In 1997, Goldsteinn was invited back to New York for a Passover Seder at his brother's house, but he decided to stay, as he had been embraced by the city's anarchist community. The anarchists provided him with a room in a \\"homestead\\" as a squatter on 9th Street in Alphabet City. In appreciation, Goldsteinn co-founded and co-curated a group art-show at their community center, ABC No Rio.

Early life Kustro≈Ñ spent his childhood in the southern town of Nowy SƒÖcz, where his family had settled. In high school, he was an active member of youth organizations fighting for Poland‚Äôs independence (see Partitions of Poland), such as the ZET Youth Association. In 1910 he began studying law and philosophy at the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w, and two years later joined the paramilitary Riflemen's Association. After the outbreak of World War I, Kustron joined the Polish Legions, and was promoted to platoon commander in the Second Infantry Regiment of the Legions. On 29 October 1914 he was wounded during the Battle of Molotkowo and, after recuperating, was promoted to porucznik (lieutenant). Transferred to the 4th Infantry Regiment, he fought against the Russians in the area of Lublin, and in Volhynia, and was promoted to captain. After the Oath crisis, Kustron was demoted by the Austrians, and moved to an infantry regiment of the Austro-Hungarian Army. From 1917, he was an active member of the Polish Military Organisation, and in late autumn of 1918, he participated in the disarmament of Austrian troops in Krak√≥w. After Poland regained independence in late 1918, Kustro≈Ñ worked for the Ministry of Military Affairs. During the Polish-Soviet War, he oversaw military rail transportation from July 1920 and, three years later, he was awarded the Virtuti Militari order.  Between the wars  In the inter-war period, Kustro≈Ñ served in several infantry units. He was deputy of the 42nd Infantry Regiment in Bia≈Çystok, then commander of the 55th Infantry Regiment in Leszno. During the May Coup, he supported J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, and prevented his regiment from going to Warsaw to fight for the lawful president. In the late 1930s, he commanded the Pomeranian 16th Infantry Division from GrudziƒÖdz and, in 1935, he was appointed commander of the 21st Mountain Infantry Division from Bielsko-Bia≈Ça. With this unit, he took part in the annexation of Zaolzie (Cesky Tesin) in 1938 (see Independent Operational Group Silesia) and was promoted to brigadier general in March 1939.  Second World War  During the Polish September Campaign, Kustro≈Ñ's division was part of the Krak√≥w Army, and was engaged in heavy fighting with the advancing Wehrmacht from the first day of the war. After several battles and skirmishes, the division, retreating east, found itself near the town of Oleszyce on 16 September. Trying to break through German lines and reach Lw√≥w, the Poles fought a battle with Wehrmacht‚Äôs 45th Infantry Division. Kustro≈Ñ was killed at around 2 p.m. He was buried on the battlefield, and in 1953, his remains were moved to Nowy SƒÖcz. He was the first Polish general to die in the invasion, and the second general officer casualty of the campaign overall; the first was Wilhelm Fritz von Roettig.

The crisis was triggered by a telegram from King Christian X of Denmark to Adolf Hitler, acknowledging Hitler's congratulations on the occasion of the king's 72nd birthday on 26 September 1942. Hitler was outraged by the perfunctory response of \\"Spreche Meinen besten Dank aus. Chr. Rex\\" (English: \\"Giving my best thanks, King Christian\\"). After this perceived slight, Hitler recalled his ambassador from Copenhagen and expelled the Danish ambassador from Germany. Attempts to placate Hitler, including a proposal of sending Crown Prince Frederick to Berlin to apologize to Hitler personally, were refused. In early November 1942, the plenipotentiary, Cecil von Renthe-Fink, was replaced by Werner Best and the commander of the German forces in Denmark Erich L√ºdke was replaced with the more heavy-handed General Hermann von Hanneken, and all remaining Danish troops were ordered out of Jutland. German pressure also resulted in the dismissal of the government led by Vilhelm Buhl and its replacement with a new cabinet led by non-party member and veteran diplomat Erik Scavenius, whom the Germans expected to be more cooperative. The background to the crisis was not only the famous telegram, but also a growing dissatisfaction in the German leadership--especially Hitler--with their occupation of Denmark, where the resistance movement was starting to be felt.

Artifacts found in the cave represent some of the earliest examples of prehistoric art and musical instruments ever discovered. The cave is just outside the town of Schelklingen in the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, near Ulm. In 2017 the site became part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \\"Caves and Ice Age Art in the Swabian Jura\\". Features The cave entrance is at above sea level. The cave consists of a tunnel of about length and a main hall with a volume of , making the cave hall one of the largest of Southern Germany. Discoveries The first excavation took place in 1870, yielding remnants of cave bears, reindeer, mammoths and horses as well as tools belonging to the Aurignacian culture of the Upper Paleolithic. Further excavations during 1958 to 1960, 1977, and 2002 yielded a number of spectacular finds, including several specimens of prehistoric sculpture such as an ivory bird and a human-lion hybrid figure similar to the L√∂wenmensch figurine but only 2.5 cm tall. In 2005, one of the oldest phallic representations was discovered. In 2008, a team from the University of T√ºbingen, led by archaeologist Nicholas Conard, discovered an artifact known as the Venus of Hohle Fels, dated to about 35,000 to 40,000 years ago. This is the earliest known Venus figurine and the earliest undisputed example of expressly human figurative art. The team also unearthed a bone flute in the cave, and found two fragments of ivory flutes in nearby caves. The flutes date back at least 35,000 years and are some of the earliest musical instruments ever found. In 2012, it was announced that an earlier discovery of bone flute fragments in Gei√üenkl√∂sterle Cave now date back to about 42,000 years, instead of 37,000 years, as earlier perceived. In 2020 a twenty centimetre long forty thousand year old mammoth tusk with a line of four holes drilled into it was interpreted as being a device for making rope. Grooves around each hole would have held plant fibres in place. The instrument was found near the base of the Aurignacian deposits at Hohle Fels by a team led by Nicholas Conard of the institute of archaeological sciences at the University of T√ºbingen. Veerle Rots, of the University of Li√®ge in Belgium was able to make four twisted strands of twine, using a bronze replica of the Hohle Fels cave device, an example of reconstruction archaeology. A similar 15,000 years old device, made of reindeer antler, was found in Gough's Cave in Cheddar Gorge, Somerset and at many other sites. The existence of these tools at different locations indicates rope-making had already become an important human activity by the Upper Paleolithic. Chris Stringer Research Leader in Human Origins at the Natural History Museum said, ‚ÄúThese devices were called batons and were originally thought to have been carried by chiefs as badges of rank. However, they had holes with spirals round them and we now realise they must have been used to make or manipulate ropes.‚Äù The ropes could then have been used to construct fishing nets, snares and traps, bows and arrows, clothing and containers for carrying food. Heavy objects, such as sleds, could now be hauled on ropes while spear points could be lashed to poles. Archaeogenetics The remains of at least five distinct individuals were found at Hohle Fels. In 2016, researchers successfully extracted the DNA from three samples taken from the Magdalenian period found at Hohle Fels. The tests were performed on two femur fragments, HohleFels10 and HohleFels49, and a cranial fragment, HohleFels79. The two femur fragments possibly came from one individual. HohleFels10 and HohleFels49 were indirectly dated to around 16,000-14,260 BP BP, while HohleFels79 was directly dated to around 15,070-14,270 BP. All three samples were found to belong to mtDNA Haplogroup U8a. The Hohle Fels samples were found to be genetically closest to other ancient samples from the Magdalenian, showing closest genetic affinity to each other and for other samples taken from the Swabian Jura, such as Brillenh√∂hle, while also showing genetic affinity for another Magdalenian sample, taken from the Red Lady of El Mir√≥n, as well as a sample from the Aurignacian, GoyetQ116-1, taken from Goyet Caves. UNESCO World Heritage Site In January 2016, the federal government of Germany applied for the status of World Heritage Site for two valleys with six caves named H√∂hlen der √§ltesten Eiszeitkunst (\\"Caves with the oldest Ice Age art\\"). The site would encompass areas in the Lonetal (valley of the Lone) and the Achtal (valley of the Ach) both in the southern Swabian Jura. The former includes the caves Hohlenstein- Stadel, Vogelherd and Bocksteinh√∂hle, the latter Geissenkl√∂sterle, Hohle Fels and Sirgenstein Cave. Each valley would contain a core area of around length, surrounded by a buffer zone of a least width. In the argument why these sites deserve recognition as a part of the universal human heritage, the area is described as the source of the currently oldest (non-stationary) works of human art in the form of carved animal and humanoid figurines as well as the oldest musical instruments. Their creators lived, were inspired and worked in and around these caves. The caves also served as the repositories of the figurines which may have been used in a religious context. In addition, they were the venue where performers used the excavated musical instruments and where the social groups lived from which the artists sprang. The committee awarded the status of WHS in July 2017. See also * Art of the Upper Paleolithic NotesFurther reading * Jill Cook: Ice Age Art: the Arrival of the Modern Mind.

He was the fourth son of W≈Çadys≈Çaw, Duke of Opole- Racib√≥rz, by his wife Euphemia, daughter of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Odonic, Duke of Greater Poland. He was born between 21 October 1258 and 12 June 1268.

In 1285, Przemys≈Çaw, together with the brothers (except Bolko I) supported the Bishop Thomas II Zaremba in his fight against Henry IV Probus, Duke of Wroc≈Çaw, and even the Bishop found refuge in Racib√≥rz. In 1287 Henry IV made a retaliatory expedition against Racib√≥rz, who was sieged and almost destroyed. In 1290 was made the formal division of the Duchy of Racib√≥rz. Przemys≈Çaw retained the main city of Racib√≥rz and Mieszko I obtained Cieszyn and O≈õwiƒôcim. A year later, the Duke of Racib√≥rz, together with his brothers Mieszko I and Bolko I paid homage to the King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia (the other brother, Casimir was a vassal of Bohemia since 1289). It is unknown whether Przemys≈Çaw was also considered to be a vassal, but this is very likely. In the internal politics, Przemys≈Çaw made two important events in his lands: in 1299 he granted urban privileges to the city of Racib√≥rz and founded a Dominican monastery there. Przemys≈Çaw died on 7 May 1306 and was buried in the Dominican monastery in Racib√≥rz.

Brenner first became known in Philadelphia in the late 1980s as a music writer for such publications as The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia Weekly (then called Welcomat), Tower Records' Pulse and more. He soon switched course and returned to playing music, joining local band Flight of Mavis as its second guitarist. In 1990, Brenner's own project, The Low Road, was in its infancy but grew quickly and soon forced a 'one or the other decision.' Brenner left Flight of Mavis to concentrate on The Low Road, which eventually inked a deal with Caroline Records. The band put out two discs on Caroline/Passenger: The Devil's Pocket and Fidelity and toured with Los Lobos, Ben Folds Five, Barenaked Ladies, Black 47 and others. When the Low Road broke up in 1997, Brenner was already taken with the sound of the square-necked dobro or resonator guitar. Largely inspired by Jerry Douglas, Mike Auldridge and Josh Graves, he became quite fluent in bluegrass and country dobro styles. The first project that featured his slide playing was John Train, then a duo with Brenner and songwriter and guitarist Jon Houlon. This band remains viable today and includes drummer Mark Schreiber, bassist Steve Demarest, mandolinist Bill Fergusson and electric/steel guitarist Mark Tucker. Around this time, Brenner also played lap steel with NYC country duo Y'ALL. Brenner played dobro on the first disc by Philadelphia band Marah, \\"Let's Cut The Crap and Hook Up Later Tonight,\\" and shortly thereafter joined as a touring member of this band, primarily playing lap steel guitar. He wound up recording tracks on their lauded 2nd disc \\"Kids in Philly\\" and touring the US and Europe, including many gigs as an opening act for Steve Earle, the Jayhawks, Government Mule and more. During his tenure with Marah, Brenner began experimenting with combining the dobro and electronica beats. His initial efforts, produced by John Wicks, led to a deal with Bong Load Records in Los Angeles, produced by Tom Rothrock (Beck, Foo Fighters, James Blunt, Richard Thompson) and Beale Dabbs. The CD, titled \\"Novelty\\", came out in 2001 under the name Slo-Mo. The disc featured the talents of Attraction's drummer Pete Thomas, singer/guitarist Johnny Irion, Jenny Benford and many more. Since then, Slo-Mo has morphed into a hip-hop hybrid, mainly due to the addition and collaboration of Mic Wrecka, a Philly rapper. The 2nd Slo-Mo disc, 2005's My Buzz Comes Back, was produced by Brenner and Edan Cohen and was a local hit and received much airplay from Philadelphia Triple A radio station WXPN. The follow-up, 2007's \\"Smokey Mountain\\" continued the evolution of the band and the songwriting partnership of Brenner and Wrecka. Female vocals have played a large part in Slo-Mo's recordings. Past singers have included Nancy Falkow, Lauren Hart, Ty Stiklorius and current band members Susan Rosetti and Steph Hayes (of Stargazer Lily). Other members to pass through Slo-Mo's ranks (both recording and touring) have been trumpeter Matt Cappy (the Roots, Jill Scott) and Brian Christinzio (BC Camplight). The current line-up (as of May 2009) includes the aforementioned rhythm section of Schreiber and Demarest, plus percussionist Hoagy Wing, keyboardist Daryl Hirsch, Steph Hayes, Susan Rosetti, Brenner and Wrecka. The newly renamed Slo-Mo featuring Mic Wrecka has played with India.Arie, Arrested Development, Robert Randolph, and is a crowd favorite at the Great Blue Heron Festival in Sherman, NY. Brenner also has recorded and toured extensively with Magnolia Electric Company/Song:Ohia, projects led by songwriter Jason Molina. Brenner's work has appeared on numerous of the band's discs including those recorded by producer Steve Albini in Chicago.

With a construction history dating to about 1690, it is one of the town's oldest surviving buildings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. It is now used for commercial purposes. Description and history The Meigs-Bishop House is located in Madison's central business district, on the west side of Wall Street at Brookside Road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, large central chimney, and clapboard exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with slightly asymmetrical placement of sash windows around a nearly centered entrance. The entrance is simply framed, with a six-light transom window topped by crown moulding. Original interior features include wide floor boards, exposed posts and beams in the front rooms; the fireplace surrounds in these rooms are later alterations. The house was built in stages, the oldest portion being a single three-bay pile dating to c. 1690. A second pile was added in the early 18th century, with the addition of the rear leanto c. 1725 to give the house a saltbox appearance. There were further additions in the late 19th century. It is believed to be Madison's second oldest house. Its initial construction was by Janna Meigs, who represented what was then Guilford in the colonial assembly. It was later owned by Phineas Meigs, who served in the American Revolutionary War, and was killed defending the area from a British raid. In the 20th century, it was adapted for commercial use.Front Parlour website retrieved on 2009-05-13 See also *List of the oldest buildings in Connecticut *National Register of Historic Places listings in New Haven County, Connecticut References Category:Madison, Connecticut Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:Houses completed in 1690 Category:Houses in New Haven County, Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in New Haven County, Connecticut Category:1690 establishments in Connecticut ","title":"Meigs-Bishop House"},{"id":"22790964","text":"Briceland is an unincorporated community in Humboldt County, California.

Early life and education Dobson was born on 8 October 1949 in Rinteln, Germany, where his father, Arthur Dobson was commissioned as an officer. Both Arthur Dobson and Christopher Dobson's mother, Mabel Dobson (n√©e Pollard), were originally from Bradford in Yorkshire and had left school at age 14. Dobson had two older siblings, Graham and Gillian. Due to his father's postings, Dobson also lived in Lagos, Nigeria. Christopher Dobson was educated at Hereford Cathedral Junior School, and then Abingdon School from 1960 until 1967. He completed a Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy at the University of Oxford, where he was a student of Keble College, Oxford and Merton College, Oxford. Research and career Dobson's research largely focused on protein folding and protein misfolding, and its association with medical disorders particularly Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. By applying chemical and biophysical techniques, Dobson investigated links between protein structure, function, and disease. He is well known for his serendipitous discovery that ordinary proteins can misfold and aggregate to form amyloid structures. Dobson authored and co-authored over 800 papers and review articles, including 38 in Nature, Science and Cell, which have been cited over 100,000 times. his H-index is 153. Dobson held research fellowships at Merton College, Oxford and then Linacre College, Oxford before working at Harvard University. He returned to Oxford in 1980 as a Fellow of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford and as a University Lecturer in Chemistry, later receiving promotions to Reader, then Professor of Chemistry in 1996. Dobson moved to the University of Cambridge in 2001 as the John Humphrey Plummer Professor of Chemical and Structural Biology. In 2007, he became the Master of St John's College, Cambridge, a post which he held until his death in September 2019. In 2012, Dobson founded the Cambridge Centre for Misfolding Diseases, which is currently based in the Chemistry of Health building at the Department of Chemistry at the University of Cambridge. In 2016, Chris Dobson co-founded Wren Therapeutics, a biotechnology start-up company whose mission is to find new therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease. =Awards and honours= Dobson was knighted in the 2018 Queen's Birthday Honours for his contributions to science and higher education. In 2009, Dobson was awarded the Royal Medal by the Royal Society \\"for his outstanding contributions to the understanding of the mechanisms of protein folding and mis-folding, and the implications for disease\\", and in 2014 he received both the Heineken Prize for Biochemistry and Biophysics and the Feltrinelli International Prize for Medicine.

Plot The time is 1905, the place New York City, where Esther, a black seamstress, lives in a boarding house for women and sews intimate apparel for clients who range from wealthy white patrons to black prostitutes. Her skills and discretion are much in demand, and she has managed to stuff a good sum of money into her quilt over the years. One by one, the other denizens of the boarding house marry and move away, but Esther remains, lonely and longing for a husband and a future. Her plan is to find the right man and use the money she's saved to open a beauty parlor where black women will be treated as royally as the white women she sews for. By way of a mutual acquaintance, she begins to receive beautiful letters from a lonesome Caribbean man named George Armstrong who is working on the Panama Canal. Being illiterate, Esther has one of her patrons respond to the letters, and over time the correspondence becomes increasingly intimate until George persuades her that they should marry, sight unseen. Meanwhile, Esther's heart seems to lie with the Hasidic shopkeeper from whom she buys fabric, and his heart with her, but the impossibility of the match is obvious to them both, and Esther consents to marry George. When George arrives in New York, however, he turns out not to be the man his letters painted him to be, and he absconds with Esther's savings, frittering it away on whores, liquor, and gambling. Deeply wounded by the betrayal, but somehow unbroken, Esther returns to the boarding house determined to use her gifted hands and her sewing machine to refashion her dreams and make them anew from the whole cloth of her life's experiences. The final stage directions reveal that Esther is also pregnant. The play is based on the life of Nottage's great-grandmother.Zinoman, Jason. \\"Lynn Nottage Enters Her Flippant Period\\" The New York Times, June 13, 2004 Critical response The CurtainUp reviewer of the 2004 production at the Mark Taper Forum wrote: \\"...the lyric and powerful expressive writing of playwright Lynn Nottage. She's an actor's gift with sly one-syllable humorous punch words; poetic paintings of physical and emotional landscapes; dramatic conflict that pulls no punches and is not afraid to make sympathetic characters unsympathetic; and an intimate knowledge of loneliness and passion.\\" The reviewer for The New York Times of a 2010 production at the Two River Theatre Company (Red Bank, New Jersey), wrote: \\"If you‚Äôve seen Ms. Nottage‚Äôs 'Ruined,' about Congolese women in wartime,... no introduction is necessary.

Keeping two sets of books has its disadvantages and advantages. The concept of having two sets of books is so that public traded companies can prepare the financial statements for the US Securities and Exchange Commission, investors and sometimes the Internal Revenue Service. That is considered an advantage because it shows investors that they are a rich company. Therefore, they can get more shareholders to buy their stocks. The disadvantage with these companies for having two sets of books is when they report one or both of the books to the Internal Revenue Service, they tend to lower their income to avoid taxes. Keeping \\"two sets of books\\" does not always refer to an illegal practice. Most publicly-traded companies use the legal practice ans abide by the rules set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) when they prepare financial statements and abide by the Internal Revenue Code when they prepare tax returns. The goal is then to maximize income for the financial statements so tthat when investors see them, they are intrigued to invest. On the other hand, companies want to have a lower income on the tax returns to avoid being required to pay high taxes. Organisations that keep two sets of books can sometimes be caught out when a tax inspector or other official happens to make a visit and asks to see the books, and an inexperienced member of staff happens to be on duty and shows the wrong set of books.

It was written, directed and produced by David O. Rogers. It satirizes the use of redshirts on the television series as well as the show itself, its fans, and popular culture.  Plot  The disillusioned and disgruntled redshirt Crewman Averson is stuck on patrol on an unknown planet when he meets optimistic Crewman Leeds, who is new on board the USS Enterprise. As the two search for an energy field, Averson tells Leeds the true nature of redshirts as cannon fodder: \\"Redshirts die first\\" and goes on about his opinions on Captain Kirk, Spock, and other fixtures of the show. Leeds on the other hand says he is eager to serve in Starfleet, wants to learn to speak Klingon \\"just for fun\\" and his observation about how Qui-Gon Jinn doesn't disappear in Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace as does Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. Eventually, the two encounter an alien resembling a floating orb. While Averson hides, Leeds is stuck admiring its beauty and is killed. Averson tries to contact the Enterprise with his communicator, which he finds is broken and replaces it with that of Leeds and moves on.  Reception  Redshirt Blues was first shown in the 2000 Boston Film Festival, which The Boston Phoenix reporter Mike Miliard reviewed as a \\"great Star Trek parody\\". It was also screened at the 2000 Pacific Palisades Film Festival, 2001 Nodance Film Festival, and shown on a special Star Trek episode of Sci Fi Channel's short film television series Exposure on September 16, 2001. Entertainment Weekly reviews it as an \\"amusing riff on the hapless Starfleet crewmen whose uniforms invariably mark them for untimely deaths.\\" Overall, Wook Kim rated the Exposure episode as \\"B\\".

Life Born about 1501, he was son of Sir Thomas Forster (d. 1527) of Etherston, Northumberland, marshal of Berwick, and his wife Dorothy, daughter of Ralph Ogle, 3rd Baron Ogle and Margaret Gascoigne. Trained from early youth in border warfare, he was in August 1542 put in command of Harbottle Castle with a garrison of a hundred men. He fought at the Battle of Solway Moss, 23 November 1542, under Thomas Wharton, 1st Baron Wharton, and claimed to have captured Robert Maxwell, 5th Baron Maxwell; Cuthbert Tunstall and Suffolk, however, determined that Maxwell's real captor was Edward Aglionby. He fought also at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh, 1547. Knighted by Protector Somerset in 1547, he was sheriff of Northumberland, 1549-50. On 4 August 1563 he was appointed a commissioner to treat concerning the delimitation of the borders, and on 10 January 1565 to discuss the position of James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray and other Scottish exiles in England. In 1569 he assisted in suppressing the Rebellion of the Northern Earls, and in 1570 took punitive measures against the Scottish borderers who had helped them. In August 1572 he was ordered to have the Earl of Northumberland executed. Forster came to Holyrood Palace in August 1573 as an ambassador to discuss border affairs.Thomas Thomson, A diurnal of remarkable occurrents that have passed within Scotland (Edinburgh, 1833), p. 336 His role included regular meetings with the Scottish Wardens on days of truce. His meeting with Sir John Carmichael on 7 July 1575 turned into a battle, and he was defeated and captured. His lieutenant, Sir George Heron, among others, was killed. Forster and his companions, after a few days at Dalkeith Palace, were released by Regent Morton, on Elizabeth's remonstrances. On 27 July 1585, Forster and his son-in-law, Francis, Lord Russell were attacked by Thomas Kerr of Ferniehirst, and Russell was killed. Forster at first described it as an accident, but this did not suit the English government, and, with a view to exacting compensation, Russell's death was represented as the result of a deliberate plot. Meanwhile various accusations, promoted perhaps by local feuds, were brought against Forster; he was said to have connived at murder, set thieves at liberty, executed others on insufficient grounds, and had dealings with Northumberland wreckers. Articles based on these accusations were drawn up on 27 September 1586, and Forster was dismissed from his office, Lord Eure being appointed in his place. Lord Hunsdon, however, thought the charges frivolous, and about April 1588 Forster was restored. He held the wardenry until October 1595, when he was again superseded by Lord Eure; his removal was due partly to his old age, partly to a renewal of the charges against him. On 24 October 1597 he was nearly surprised at Bamburgh Castle by a party of Scots. He died at Bamburgh on 13 January 1602.

Scott (1986). The Butterflies of North America. Stanford University Press, Stanford, CA. Flight The Palamedes swallowtail is encountered from May to October in southeastern Virginia and from March to December in more southern regions. In Mexico it is represented by subspecies P. p. leontis Rothschild & Jordan, 1906. Life cycle Males seek females by patrolling near forest edges and forest openings. In courtship, the male and female will fly about a foot apart, slowly flying together in unison. The male will then fly above and behind the female to disperse his pheromones and he will continue to do this until the female decides to mate with him. Females lay their pale greenish-yellow eggs singly on host plant leaves. The larva is green with two false eyespots on the thorax. It has a few blue spots on the first abdominal segment to the eighth segment. It also lives in a leaf shelter.Thomas J. Allen, Jim P. Brock, Jeffrey Glassberg (2005). Caterpillars in the Field and Garden. Oxford University Press, New York, NY. David L. Wagner (2005). Caterpillars of Eastern North America. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ. The larva is almost identical to the caterpillar of the spicebush swallowtail (Papilio troilus, except the spicebush swallowtail larva has larger false eyes, larger blue spots, and different host plant preferences.) However, in the coastal Southeast, a subspecies of the spicebush swallowtail P. t. ilioneus shares the redbay (Persea borbonia) as a host plant. The green chrysalis has a whitish lateral stripe edged with brown above and has two horns on the head. The chrysalis hibernates. The Palamedes swallowtail has two or three broods per year.

He served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Boston. BiographyEarly life and education= John Dooher was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts, to Irish immigrants Anthony (Tony) and Brigid (Patsy) Dooher. One of four children, he has two brothers, Francis and Terence, and one sister, Kathleen. Following the death of his aunt, many of his cousins moved in with his family. He had several priests in his family. He was inspired as a young man by Fr. Mortimer Gavin, who founded the Boston Labor Guild. He studied at St. John's Seminary in Brighton, from where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965 and a Master's in Divinity in 1969. =Ordination and ministry= Dooher was ordained to the priesthood on May 21, 1969, and then served as associate pastor at St. Francis Xavier Church in Weymouth and chaplain at South Shore Hospital and South Weymouth Naval Air Station until 1974. From 1974 to 1991, he served at St. Augustine Church in South Boston. During this period, he was also President of the Priests' Senate (1978‚Äì1982) and Director of the Office of Spiritual Development (1982‚Äì1991). From 1991 to 1996, Dooher served at St. Vincent de Paul Church and Ss. Peter and Paul Church, which were later merged. He was then named pastor of St. Mary of the Assumption Church in Dedham in 1996. At St. Mary's, Dooher also founded the Life Teen program. He said that Life Teen was \\"one of the most satisfying things I've ever been involved with in ministry. If there's any group that needs to feel as if they belong to a church, its teenagers, and Life Teen really helps with that.\\" Dooher was part of the Singing Priests, a group that performed for various charities, and plays the guitar, harp, and piano. =Auxiliary Bishop of Boston= On October 12, 2006, Dooher was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Boston and Titular Bishop of Theveste by Pope Benedict XVI.

As an auxiliary, Dooher serves as regional bishop for the South Pastoral Region. His appointment was met with some criticism from advocates of sexual abuse victims' rights, who claimed that Dooher \\"abetted a harmful and immoral coverup for the Boston archdiocese\\" as a priest. He had been mentioned in a 2003 report by Attorney General Thomas Reilly as one of two priests who in the mid-1990s met with pastors in parishes affected by abuse cases, and in a 2002 deposition by Bishop John McCormack as having participated in conversations in the Archdiocese in 1994 about where to house abusive priests.

Bull Creek Road parallels Bull Creek and is also known as the Mattole Road. History Members of the Eel River Athapaskan peoples, a group known as the Northern Sinkyone people lived along the South Fork of the Eel River between Miranda and the South Fork confluence with the Eel, and for a short way on both sides of Dyerville. Their main village was at the confluence of the South Fork and Bull Creek. The first written record of the area is in the Journal of George Gibbs who accompanied Indian agent Redick McKee's expedition in 1851. Gibbs remarked on a level prairie within redwoods described as being up to in diameter near the ground, that the language spoken by locals here was different than those they had contacted previously and described a redwood canoe. The area was settled in the 1850s, but the large trees prevented anything but small-scale farming and logging until after the development of heavy equipment.Jager, Douglas and Richard LaVen, Twenty years of rehabilitation work in Bull Creek, Humboldt Redwoods State Park, http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/tmdl/records/region_1/2003/ref1178.pdf, pages 322-328 The town of Bull Creek was located near the present day Albee Campground. Clearcutting the forest began in 1946 and between 1950 and 1959 over 10,000 acres of the forest burned in uncontrolled wildfires. About three dozen homes washed away in the 1955 floods; coffins from the cemetery ended up in the redwood trees. Additionally the contents of the saw mill log deck, propane tanks, cars and other debris were washed into the creek and downstream. Gravel entrainment in the flood resulted in a county bridge being buried. By 1960, almost 60 percent of the forest cover in the area had been clearcut, but no reforestation or erosion control had been put into place. The Christmas flood of 1964 removed all the CCC buildings, mud and debris slides from clear cut slopes above Bull Creek resulted in massive damages for areas downstream. Almost of sand and gravel were deposited in the creek in this flood event, and the same bridge which was buried in 1955, was again covered in gravel. Over 850 large redwoods were washed into the flood. The channel, which in 1955 had been about wide had been enlarged by slope failure and erosional force to over in places. Bull Creek.

The original conference attracted approximately 60 people. The group was concerned that there was activity occurring in networked simulation, but that it was occurring in isolation. The group believed that if there were a means to exchange information between companies and groups that the technology would advance more rapidly. The group also believed that once the technology begins to stabilize then there would also be a need for standardization. The technology and the consensus of the community would be captured in the standards as networking or simulation technology matured.\\"About SISO\\", SISO, 13 May 2009 The pre-history of SISO starts with SIMNET, a DARPA program from 1983 through 1991 that demonstrated the feasibility of networking substantial numbers of (relatively) low-cost simulators on a \\"virtual battlefield.\\" Based on the success of this program, the US Army initiated a large-scale program called Combined Arms Tactical Training. In order to ensure that multiple teams of contractors would be able to bid on various components of this program, the Army Program Manager for Training Devices (PM TRADE), soon to be renamed as the Army Simulation Training and Instrumentation Command (STRICOM - now PEO STRI), in conjunction with DARPA and the newly established Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO now Modeling and Simulation Coordination Office (MSCO)), initiated a series of workshops at which user agencies and interested contractors could work together to develop standards based on the SIMNET protocols. The \\"First Conference on Standards for the Interoperability of Defense Simulations\\" was held on 22‚Äì23 August 1989 in Orlando, Florida. DIS Workshops were held semi- annually from 1989 through 1996. The first Simulation Interoperability Workshop (SIW) held under the SISO banner was the 1997 Spring SIW in Orlando. SIWs have continued semi-annually since 1997. In 2001, SISO also began holding annual Euro-SIWs at various locations in Europe.

According to Mead, poverty is mainly found in minority groups and is caused by a lack of work ethic in their cultures. Mead believes that so-called \\"entitlement\\" form a harmful welfare culture of dependence. In a study conducted by fellow economist Stephen M. Petterson, Mead's argument was not supported, and Petterson found that differences in employment between Black and White men could not be attributed to differences in \\"willingness to work.\\" Scholars Stanford M.

In the paper, Mead argues that Black and Hispanic people in the United States are poor because they \\"typically respond only weakly to chances to get ahead through education and work\\" due to cultural differences in adapting to the \\"individualist culture\\" of the United States, a culture he posits is derived from Europe. The paper drew widespread outrage from the academic community for perpetuating racist, xenophobic and classist stereotypes, and multiple petitions were circulated requesting a retraction.

Valerie Susan Meux, n√©e Langdon, (1847 ‚Äì 1910) was a Victorian socialite and the wife of the London brewer, Sir Henry Meux (pronounced \\"Mews\\"). She claimed to have been an actress, but was apparently on the stage for only a single season.Frick Collection, p. 18. She is believed to have met Sir Henry at the Casino de Venise in Holborn, where she worked as a banjo-playing barmaid and prostitute under the name Val Reece.Bradburn, 1989, p. 29. Glancey, 2004 James Abbott McNeill Whistler was an American expatriate and one of the most accomplished portraitists of his time.Ellis, 1990, p. 222. However, the artist had become bankrupt in 1879, following his lawsuit against the critic John Ruskin. In 1881, Lady Meux offered Whistler his first significant commission after the bankruptcy. Her full-length portrait, known as Arrangement in Black, No. 5 (Portrait of Lady Meux) now hangs in the Honolulu Museum of Art. It shows her dressed in black with a long white fur coat, diamond tiara, diamond necklace, and diamond bracelet. Reportedly, the painting was commended by Edward VII of the United Kingdom (then Prince of Wales) and Princess Alexandra, when they saw it in the artist‚Äôs studio.Ellis, 1990, p. 222. The painting was also exhibited in the 1882 Paris Salon, where it was enthusiastically received.Ellis, 2000, p. 209. Whistler painted a second portrait of Lady Meux in 1881 called Harmony in Pink and Grey (Portrait of Lady Meux) which belongs to the Frick Collection in New York City. This full-length portrait shows the subject on stage standing before a pinkish-grey curtain, in an obvious allusion to her alleged stage career. She wears a light grey dress trimmed in pink satin. The butterfly emblem that Whistler used as a signature is on the right side of the painting a little below the middle. Whistler assigned many of his paintings titles with terms like ‚Äúarrangement‚Äù and ‚Äúharmony‚Äù, which may be interpreted as either musical or abstract. A third painting known as Portrait of Lady Meux in Furs was also commenced in 1881. This canvas was probably destroyed by the artist in a dispute with the sitter,Sutton, 1974, p. 42. however a photograph of it exists in the Whistler Archives, University of Glasgow, Scotland. Both the Honolulu painting and the destroyed painting belong to a series of ‚Äúblack portraits‚Äù, paintings Whistler executed at various stages of his career in a palette dominated by black.

Plants used for bedding are generally annuals, biennials or tender perennials; succulents are gaining in popularity. Some bedding plants are also referred to as \\"patio plants\\" because they are widely used in pots and other containers positioned on patios, terraces, decking and other areas around houses. Larger tender \\"conservatory plants\\" may also be moved out from greenhouses or conservatories and planted out in borders (or stood in their pots in sheltered positions) for the warmer months, then returned to shelter for the winter. The modern bedding plant industry breeds and produces plants with a neat, dwarf habit, which flower uniformly and reliably. They are bred primarily for use in large-scale bedding schemes where uniformity and predictability is of paramount importance, but this is often achieved by losing the plants' individual character, and has been criticised by such notable plantsmen as the late Christopher Lloyd, who championed an informal style of bedding. Spring bedding with tulips, wallflowers and forget-me-nots Bedding plants There exists a huge range of plants specifically grown to produce a period of flower colour throughout the spring and summer, and (usually) discarded after flowering. They may conveniently be divided into four groups: *Hardy annuals sown directly into the ground early in the season (poppy, stock, sunflower, clarkia, godetia, eschscholzia, nigella, dianthus) *Tender annual or perennial plants treated as half-hardy annuals ‚Äì sown under glass in late winter in heat, or purchased as young plants, and hardened-off outdoors when all danger of frost has passed (begonia, lobelia, petunia, argyranthemum, chrysanthemum, pelargonium, nicotiana, cosmos, fuchsia) *Hardy biennial plants, or perennials treated as biennial, sown in one year to flower the next, and discarded after flowering (antirrhinum, polyanthus, wallflower, daisy, foxglove, some dianthus, some poppies, campanula, delphinium, aubrieta, aquilegia, cornflower, pansies) *Corms, rhizomes, bulbs and tubers, planted each year and lifted after the plant has died down and stored in winter, or discarded (tulip, narcissus, hyacinth, gladiolus, dahlia, canna) Types of bedding Formal bedding, as seen in parks and large gardens, where whole flower beds are replanted two or three times a year, is a costly and labour-intensive process. Towns and cities are encouraged to produce impressive displays by campaigns such as \\"Britain in bloom\\". Spring bedding (tulips and polyanthus), South Shields, UK =Spring bedding= Plants used for spring bedding are often biennials (sown one year to flower the next), or hardy, but short-lived, perennials. Spring-flowering bulbs such as tulips are often used, typically with forget-me-nots, wallflowers, winter pansies and polyanthus. =Summer bedding= Formal summer bedding scheme in Victoria Park, Bath, Somerset. Most of the colour is provided by large-flowered begonias Plants used for summer bedding are generally annuals or tender perennials. They become available (often as what are referred to as \\"plug plants\\") in nurseries and garden centres during spring, to be gradually \\"hardened off\\" (acclimatised to outdoor conditions) by the purchaser and finally planted out around the time that the last frosts are expected. Experienced gardeners keep an eye on the weather forecasts at that time of year and are on standby to protect their bedding displays overnight with horticultural fleece (or the older alternatives of net curtains or newspaper) if frost threatens. Carpet bedding Municipal carpet bedding schemes often incorporate lettering Carpet bedding employs two or more contrasting plant cultivars with a neat, dwarf habit and distinct colouring (of flower or foliage) to create geometric displays. It is often used to form such things as lettering, logos or trademarks, coats of arms, or floral clocks. Suitable plants are rosette-forming succulents such as Echeveria or fairly slow-growing or mat-forming foliage plants, such as coloured-leaved Alternanthera cultivars, which are tolerant of clipping; such plants may also be used in three-dimensional sculptural forms or pseudo-topiary. =Winter bedding= Planted in autumn to give a display until early spring, the plants used for winter bedding are mainly hardy perennials. As it has to be planted at the same time of year as spring bedding does, winter bedding tends to be less commonly seen, except in containers such as windowboxes. Some are short- lived and will be discarded after their first display; others may be used as a source of cuttings for the next year. Winter-hardy ornamental vegetables such as cultivars of kale and cabbage with coloured or variegated foliage are increasingly common. Primula cultivars (polyanthus and primroses) are commonly used, as are winter-flowering heathers and Viola √ówittrockiana, winter pansies. Variegated evergreens such as cultivars of Vinca minor (lesser periwinkle), Euonymus fortunei and Hedera helix (ivies) are also popular.

The word culdoscopy (and culdoscope) is derived from the term cul-de-sac, which means literally in French \\"bottom of a sac\\", and refers to the rectouterine pouch (or called the pouch of Douglas). The culdoscope is a non-flexible endoscope, basically a modified laparoscope. A trocar is first inserted through the vagina into the posterior cul-de-sac, the space behind the cervix, allowing then the entry of the culdoscope. Due to the position of the patient intestines fall away from the pelvic organs which can then be inspected. Conditions diagnosable by culdoscopy include tubal adhesions (causing sterility), ectopic pregnancy, and salpingitis. Culdoscopy allows the performance of minor procedures such as tubal sterilization. Culdoscopy is performed with the patient in a knee chest position under local or general anesthesia. There is no insufflation of the abdomen as necessary in laparoscopy. There is no abdominal incision, the entry point in the vagina is closed with a suture. The procedure was inaugurated by Albert Decker in 1939 and became popular after his reported experience in 1944. Decker had his culdoscope made by American Cystoscope Makers (ACM). He published a textbook about culdoscopy in 1952. The use of culdoscopy faded in the 1970s as the laparoscopic approach was recognized to be superior due to technological advancements.

It is now supported by the Landmark Trust and is available as holiday accommodation. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building and is considered notable partly due to the substantial survival of medieval construction throughout. The first building on the site was an open hall house erected before 1350. It was rebuilt around 1400 with various additions during the 15th century. William Dodisham added the south wing, porch, and kitchen and put in new windows. In 1480 he left it to his niece Agnes, who married local landowner Walter Michael. Their family and descendants owned and improved the manor until 1616. It then became a farmhouse often inhabited by tenants until the early 20th century. In these 300 years the property enjoyed few improvements but nonetheless suffered few fundamental alterations. In World War II the house was divided into flats by a Mr Harris, whose descendants sold it to the Landmark Trust in the 1980s. The interior includes the remnants of a 17th-century strapwork plaster ceiling. Restoration work in the late 20th century included the repair of structural problems as well as the construction of new oak roof trusses made in a traditional fashion with an adze.

Diderichsen was professor of Danish at the University of Copenhagen from 1943 until his death. The Diderichsen Sentence Model In order to describe the different operations in Danish syntax, Diderichsen developed a model, making use of ordered slots into which different sentence constituents can be inserted. Danish is a so-called V2 language, a language in which the verb is nearly always the second constituent in a wellformed clause, the preverbal slot can be used to insert many different kinds of syntactic elements. The basic model distinguishes a grounding field, a nexus field and a content field. The grounding field contains elements that are moved out of one of the other slots in order to serve as the theme of the sentence. The nexus field contains slots for the finite verb and its arguments and adverbial modifiers. The content field contains the infinite verb, its object and adverbial modifiers.

The game was ported to the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A computer and the IBM PCjr. Microsurgeon was re-released as part of the Intellivision Rocks collection. Plot A tanker carrying hazardous material was damaged during an accident, allowing the gas inside to escape. Those exposed to the fumes begin to suffer a range of immune disorders, such as rampant bacterial infections, rapidly growing tumors, and widespread tar deposits in the lungs. Patients are being rushed to Xenon Medical Center for emergency microsurgery before their conditions become fatal; the player assumes the role of a member of the surgical staff. Gameplay Microsurgeon is one of the first published video games related to health or health education. The player must guide a tiny medical device, the Robot Probe, throughout a patient's body to treat the ailments affecting various organs, such as bacterial infections, brain tumors, cholesterol blockages in arteries, and tapeworms. At the start of the game, the player is presented with the patient's status chart, which shows information on each individual organ as well as an overall condition, ranging from \\"Good\\" to \\"Terminal.\\" The Robot Probe is equipped with three different treatments: ultrasonic rays, antibiotics, and aspirin. The treatment to be used depends on the ailment; for example, bacteria only respond to antibiotics, while viruses can only be temporarily disabled with aspirin. If the Robot Probe moves outside of the patient's blood vessels or lymphatic system, phagocytes (roaming white blood cells) will attack it and start to drain its power. Moving the Robot Probe and dispensing treatments also use up power. Any system status will slowly deteriorate toward \\"Terminal\\" until and unless it is brought up to \\"Good\\" with appropriate treatment. The ultimate goal is to bring the patient's overall status up to \\"Good\\" and exit the patient's body through the eye, ear, nose, or mouth before the power runs out. The game ends when the power reaches zero, the player pilots the Robot Probe out of the body, or the overall status reaches \\"Terminal.\\" The player's score is reported only at the end of the game, and is determined by several factors such as the overall difficulty of the surgery and the patient's final status. Reception Danny Goodman of Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games tested Microsurgeon at the summer 1982 Consumer Electronics Show. He wrote \\"From preliminary play, this cartridge looks like a 'must' for Intellivision owners for both graphics and unique game theme\\". It was noted as \\"among the most innovative computer/game software for 1982-1983\\" at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. It tied for \\"Most Original Game\\" of the year in Electronic Fun with Computers & Games magazine, December 1983. The game appeared on the cover of IEEE Spectrum, December 1982, and on The Anniversary's Designing a Nervous Breakdown album cover. Microsurgeon was among 240 video games selected to be included in \\"The Art of Video Games\\" exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution in 2012.

Crispin gave her his Captain's circlet as a sign of their marriage. ; Arran : Arran is an extremely sensible otter, one who sees what needs doing and does it with great efficiency. She reacts to a crisis with commonsense rather than emotion - but she cries when Crispin is exiled, and repeatedly risks her own safety to protect the young. She doesn't like to let Padra know how much she cares about him, because she's not altogether sure of his feelings for her. Whenever anyone says she should ask him to marry her, she just says 'He'd only laugh.' She later marries Padra and becomes a Captain of Mistmantle. She is the mother of Tide and Swanfeather. She is described as being a lighter color, like Urchin, with spiky, tufty fur on the top of her head. ; (Urchin of the Riding Stars, Urchin and the Heartstone, The Heir of Mistmantle, Urchin and the Raven War, Urchin and the Rage Tide) ; Padra : An otter captain. Padra is Crispin's best friend, and they share the same outlook of life. Padra's presence is reassuring, and if his responsibilities are sometimes heavy, he doesn't let it show. He dislikes injustice, especially towards the young, and can't stay away from the water for long. Padra has a long-term lover, Arran, but hasn't asked her to marry him because he's not convinced that she'll have him. When ever any one says he should ask her, he just says 'She'd only hit me.' When he does finally ask her she hits him and he laughs, but they do get married and have three children, Tide, Swanfeather, and Fionn. ; (Urchin of the Riding Stars, Urchin and the Heartstone, The Heir of Mistmantle, Urchin and the Raven War, Urchin and the Rage Tide) ; Hope : His real name is Hoppen, and he's much loved by the animals in charge of the Old Palace nursery. Because he's short-sighted, he's brought up in secret. He has very good manners, adores his mother Thripple, and is a brave little soul determined to get places, even if he bumps into everything in his way. He found the Heartstone in book two. In book one, He is the reason for Husk's death, as Husk was running to the dark prison that had been blessed by Brother Fir, and Hope and Urchin were in the tunnels leading towards it. Hope tried to eat crushed berries, making a blood-like stain on his chest, plus for his short-sightedness, he was wandering around like he was searching for Husk, terrifyingly like Prince Tumble, making Husk flee and fall to his death. ; (Urchin of the Riding Stars, Urchin and the Heartstone, The Heir of Mistmantle, Urchin and the Raven War) ; Needle : Needle works at the tower, especially on the Threadings - the woven, stitched and painted pictures showing the history of Mistmantle.

Like most moles he says little, and what he does say is brief and down-to-earth. He is a good judge of character and a no-nonsense, dependable animal with a dry sense of humor. He dies in book three while attempting to rescue Princess Catkin. He has a wife, Cott, and three daughters, Wing, the mother of Tip and Todd, Wren, who is married, and Moth, a member of the circle and now married to Twigg. ; (Urchin of the Riding Stars, Urchin and the Heartstone, The Heir of Mistmantle) ; Tay : Tay took an interest in the history of Mistmantle from a very early age, and then turned to a study of the law.

Dignity is important to her, and it is said that nobody has ever seen her laugh. She is very disapproving of silliness and play for an otter. She was held captive in book one after discovering the secret nursery. ; (Urchin of the Riding Stars, Urchin and the Heartstone, The Heir of Mistmantle, Urchin and the Raven War) ; Fingal : Captain Padra sent his younger brother Fingal to live on a different part of the island, preferring to keep him as far away from Husk as possible. We don't meet him until the ending of the first book, but he comes in a lot more in the next two. He is extremely carefree and talkative, and Urchin quickly realizes why Padra sent him away while Husk was in power. Throughout the second and third book, especially the third book, he matures noticeably, but is still the fun-loving and courageous otter that threw rocks at Husk's army in the first book. He is known for ridding the island of the cause of foul-drought and for his love of his own boat. ; (Urchin of the Riding Stars, Urchin and the Heartstone, The Heir of Mistmantle, Urchin and the Raven War) ; Crackle : Crackle is a tower squirrel who works at the kitchen.

Gleaner adores Lady Aspen and refuses to believe she had anything to do with Husk's tyranny. Gleaner cares about Aspen in the afterlife and is always seen bringing things to her grave. She gets very angry with those who talk badly about Aspen and easily jumps to conclusions. She is badly injured by the Silver Prince in book four. ; (Urchin of the Riding Stars, Urchin and the Heartstone, The Heir of Mistmantle, Urchin and the Raven War) ; Apple : Apple is the foster-mother of Urchin.

But he was too much aware of all this, and too ready to consider himself superior to other animals. He wanted to impress, and learned to conceal anything in himself which would meet with disapproval. He tried to take over Mistmantle by killing Prince Tumble, and seeing to Queen Spindle's death as well (through Aspen and Gleaner; Gleaner thought she was giving the Queen medicine, but it was poison) and framing Crispin for Prince Tumble's murder. Later, he falls off a sort of cliff in the dark ancient dungeon and dies. Some animals think they see him in book three, but it is only Juniper. When he was younger, he reasoned that his weak brother was a drain on society, and murdered him by pushing him off of a cliff. He was responsible for the death of Juniper's real mother and attempted to kill Juniper (his son) in order to avoid political complications. He married Aspen.1 ; Aspen : Aspen was the eldest of three sisters - the younger ones both married 'off the island', leaving Mistmantle for ever. She realized early in life that she had beauty, intelligence, and charm, and was determined to use these to the greatest advantage. She marries Lord Husk. She fell out of a window with the king and died. Gleaner was her personal maid and is still convinced that Aspen was good and sweet. Aspen most probably poisoned the Queen, as she refuses to talk to Husk about it, and the \\"special medicine\\" that was only for the Queen was given to her by Gleaner after she fell.

The Scotsman William Wallace led an uprising against the English and killed the Sheriff of Lanark, William Heselrig. The attack was not an isolated incident, but rather saw Wallace joining in with uprisings taking place across Scotland.John Prebble The Lion in the North Not much is definitely known about this incident. The best account comes from the Scalacronica by Thomas Grey, whose father, also called Thomas Grey, was present. A fracas broke out at a court being held by Heselrig, but Wallace was able to escape with help from a girl who may have been his wife. He then came back with some supporters and attacked Heselrig and his men, killed Heselrig, nearly killed Thomas Grey senior, and set fire to some houses. Wallace then continued with his rebellion, which culminated in his victory at the Battle of Stirling Bridge four months later. It is unclear what Wallace was doing at Heselrig's court, and whether this was a spontaneous incident or if it was co-ordinated with other risings in Scotland.Peter Traquair Freedom's Sword According to the 15th century poem The Wallace, written by Blind Harry, Wallace carried out the attack in revenge for the killing of his beloved wife by Heselrig. The identity of Wallace's wife is not known for certain, but her name is believed to be Marion Braidfute. Harry also claims that Wallace dismembered Heselrig's body. Fictionalised versions of this incident have appeared in various accounts of the Wallace's life, notably in the 1995 film Braveheart, in which his wife was called Murron MacClannough, and her execution preceded the battle.

It was directed by Elizabeth Allen, co-produced by Dune Entertainment, Di Novi Pictures, and Walden Media, written by Laurie Craig and Nick Pustay, and produced by Denise Di Novi and Alison Greenspan with music by Mark Mothersbaugh. The film stars Joey King, Selena Gomez, John Corbett, Bridget Moynahan, Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Duhamel, and Sandra Oh. Though the film's title is derived from Beezus and Ramona, the first of Cleary's Ramona books, the plot is mostly based on the sequels Ramona Forever and Ramona's World. Fox 2000 Pictures released the film on July 23, 2010. Ramona and Beezus earned generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $27 million. Plot The adventurous and creative third-grader Ramona Quimby (Joey King) often finds herself in trouble at school and at home, usually with her best friend, Howie (Jason Spevack). When her father Robert (John Corbett) loses his job and the family falls into severe debt, Ramona's efforts to earn money end up backfiring in humorous ways. She repeatedly embarrasses her older sister, Beatrice (Selena Gomez), calling her by her family nickname, \\"Beezus\\", in front of Beatrice's crush, the paperboy Henry Huggins (Hutch Dano). After working as an executive in a storage company since Beezus's birth, Robert causes quarrels with his wife and the girls' mother Dorothy (Bridget Moynahan) when he decides to pursue a creative career. Meanwhile, Ramona's visiting aunt Bea (Ginnifer Goodwin) is one of the few people who accept Ramona despite all her eccentricities. After a car-painting accident involving Bea's old flame Hobart (Josh Duhamel), Ramona gives up her money-making schemes. The next day, Ramona ruins her school portrait by cracking a raw egg in her hair and responding with disgust when the photographer asks her to say \\"Peas\\" instead of \\"Cheese\\". Ramona's worries increase the following day, when her classmate Susan (Sierra McCormick) reveals that after her own father lost his job, her parents divorced and her father moved to Tacoma. The news makes Ramona sick, and Robert has to pick her up early from school, interfering with a sudden job interview. Instead of being angry, Robert decides to spend the rest of his day drawing a mural with Ramona. Ramona and Beezus attempt to make dinner for their parents, but the pan catches fire while Beezus is on the phone with Henry. During the ensuing argument, Henry overhears that Beezus loves him. Still upset, Ramona goes to feed her cat Picky-Picky but is devastated to find the cat dead. The girls' private funeral for Picky-Picky helps them reconcile. A job offer for Robert in Oregon leads Ramona's parents to decide to sell their house. As the family touches up the garden during an open house, Ramona inadvertently initiates a water fight with the neighbors, which floods the neighbors' backyard and exposes a box that Hobart buried there years ago. The box contains mementos of Bea and Hobart's teenage romance, and in light of their rekindling relationship, he proposes to her. Hesitantly, Bea accepts, and the family begins planning the impromptu wedding. Furious that her aunt broke her promise not to get \\"reeled in\\", Ramona rushes home and seeks solace in the attic. The fragile rafters break, leaving Ramona's legs dangling from the ceiling during the open house. After the open house clears out, Robert scolds Ramona for her lack of maturity; Ramona and her mother then berate Robert for showing little compassion for Ramona, and he leaves. He then receives a phone call from her teacher, Mrs. Meachum (Sandra Oh). Feeling unwanted, Ramona decides to run away. Unable to convince Ramona not to leave, her mother helps her pack her suitcase. Opening the heavy suitcase at a bus stop, Ramona discovers that her mother made it heavy on purpose to keep Ramona from traveling far. Inside, her mother has packed a book of Robert's sketches of Ramona. Her family finds her soon afterward and everyone is happily reunited. At Bea and Hobart's wedding, Ramona saves the day when she finds the wedding ring Howie dropped. During the reception, Beezus and Henry share a kiss and dance together. Robert also receives a job offer from Ramona's school; Mrs. Meachum recommended Robert to the school's board as its new art teacher after she saw the mural that he and Ramona made. Ramona is delighted that the family will not have to move and that Robert and Dorothy reconcile. Before Bea and Hobart leave for their honeymoon in Alaska, Ramona gives Bea a locket with her school picture, and Bea tells Ramona that she's \\"extraordinary\\".

The German Empire was briefly involved in a military intervention in 1918. More recently, Germany has been involved in diplomatic and peacekeeping efforts to resolve the dispute between the so- called Republic of Abkhazia and Georgia, Germany's strategic ally. Early Involvement Kress von Kressenstein in 1916 Russian Tsar Alexander II established German villages near Sukhum in Abkhazia in the 1870s, hoping they would help \\"civilize\\" the newly incorporated Caucasian tribes. Russian State Archive: –†–¶–•–ò–î–ù–ò. —Ñ. 644. –æ–ø. 1. –¥. 11. –ª. 195 During World War I, concerned about the security of oil supplies from the Baku region, General Kress von Kressenstein directed the German Caucasus Expedition to give military support to the Democratic Republic of Georgia against the Bolsheviks in Abkhazia in 1918. German troops were tasked with guarding strategic infrastructure, they were never in direct conflict with any foreign troops. German general Erich Ludendorff said that turning Georgia into a German protectorate would ensure Germany access to Caucasus resources independent of Turkey. In 1942, as the German offensive in southern Russia approached the area, the Soviet government ordered removal of the Abkhaz Germans to Kazakhstan. Current German Interest Georgia, together with Armenia and Azerbaijan, is located in the South Caucasus, south of Russia. This may give Europe direct access to the energy resources of the Caspian basin via the Nabucco pipeline. Germany has said that it feels a special responsibility to act as broker in the region. Germany is coordinator of the UN secretary-general‚Äôs Group of Friends of Georgia, and pays special attention to the problems between Georgia and the separatist territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Germany is said to hold the key to Georgia's membership of NATO, and Germany's close relations with Russia make it an essential player in any resolution of the Abkhaz conflict. Group of friends Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany Following the War in Abkhazia (1992‚Äì1993), the Friends of Georgia, with representatives from France, the UK, the USA, Germany and Russia was set up to aid the UN Secretary General in the peace process. In May 1996, the ambassadors from the five countries met with president Vladislav Ardzinba in Sukhumi to discuss options for resolving the conflict. In 1997 they resumed meetings with the Georgian and Abkhaz parties in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations, with representatives of the Russian Federation and the organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe In late 2000, the group drafted a document entitled \\"Basic Principles for the Distribution of Competencies between Tbilisi and Sukhumi\\" that defined Abkhazia as \\"a sovereign entity\\" enjoying \\"special status\\" within Georgia. In December 2004, representatives of the group met in Geneva to review the state of the Georgian-Abkhaz peace process. They stressed that the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG) must continue to be in a position to fulfill its mandate unhindered. Peace Plan In July 2008, the German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier distributed a plan titled Georgia/Abkhazia: Elements for a Peaceful Settlement of the Conflict to a United Nations group of experts on Abkhazia. The plan did not mention Georgia‚Äôs territorial integrity and accepts the continued Russian presence in Abkhazia. Leaders of the opposing sides reacted positively, although the Georgians insisted that Georgia‚Äôs territorial integrity be guaranteed. The plan asked both sides to agree to avoid violence and to engage in dialog facilitated by the UN Secretary General‚Äôs Group of Friends (France, Germany, Great Britain, Russia and the U.S.). It also covered return of internally displaced persons, facilitating trade between Abkhazia and Georgia, reconstruction aid and formation of a working group to draft the political status of Abkhazia. After publishing the peace plan Frank-Walter Steinmeier visited Tbilisi for a diplomatic drive to reduce conflict in the country‚Äôs separatist conflict zones, meeting with the Georgian president and other leaders in Tbilisi, then traveling to Abkhazia to meet Abkhaz separatist leaders before flying to Moscow. Later that month German Ambassador Patricia Flor accompanied US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Mathew Bryza in a visit to Sukhumi to discuss the German Peace Plan with de facto Abkhaz leadership. De facto Abkhaz foreign minister Sergey Shamba noted that possible participation in the planned Berlin meeting did not necessarily mean that the Abkhaz side was resuming direct talks with the Georgian side. The Permanent Representative of Russia to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin also said Moscow opposed the meeting of the Group of Friends in Berlin. Active involvement Map showing security zone German military observers and paramedics are serving in the Georgia/Abkhazia crisis zone as part of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia (UNOMIG). The German involvement started in 1993. The doctors and paramedics from the German Armed Forces provide medical support to UNOMIG Sukhumi Headquarters and to the Gali and Zugdidi sectors. From 1993 until 2002, the head of UNOMIG was Dieter Boden from Germany. As an observer mission, UNOMIG played no effective role in preventing the conflict between Russia and Georgia that broke out in August 2008. Germany has provided continued funding to HALO Trust, which implements demining operations in Abkhazia, and funding for other reconstruction efforts and improvements in sanitation, health and education. German observers reportedly monitored the March 2007 elections for the Abkhaz Parliament.

Afzal Bangash became one of the leading lawyers of NWFP and during Ayub Khan's rule he was offered the judgeship of the West Pakistan high court. He declined the offer, choosing instead to concentrate on pleading cases of peasants who were being evicted by Ayub's land reforms.Afzal Bangash: A Life Dedicated to Militant Struggle, Feroz Ahmed, Economic and Political Weekly, Vol. 21, No. 51 (Dec. 20, 1986), p. 2219 Political life Bangash joined the Communist Party of Pakistan (CPP) soon after its formation in 1948 and became a member of its NWFP committee.Afzal Bangash: A Life Dedicated to Militant Struggle, Feroz Ahmed, Economic and Political Weekly, Vol. 21, No. 51 (Dec. 20, 1986), p. 2219 In 1957 he was elected as the first General Secretary of the National Awami Party (NAP). He was responsible for organizing the peasant committee in NWFP. In the 1965 Pakistani presidential election, Bangash served as Fatima Jinnah's provincial chief campaign manager in her campaign against Ayub Khan. In 1967 the NAP split, and Afzal Bangash along with other leftists who were active in peasant committees decided to follow the Wali Khan faction. However, The NAP leadership soon decided to bar Bangash and others from simultaneously working in peasant committees while being members of the NAP. As a result, they decided to leave the NAP and found the Mazdoor Kisan Party (MKP) on May 1, 1968. The MKP was to become the largest and most militant party with a Marxist orientation in the history of Pakistan.Dr Mohammad Taqi \\"Afzal Bangash: the Marxist maverick\\", Daily Times, 28 October 2010. Retrieved on 2016-09-20. Although Bangash was recognized as principal leader of the MKP, he did not hold any official position until July 1979 when he was elected its president at the party's second congress.Afzal Bangash: A Life Dedicated to Militant Struggle, Feroz Ahmed, Economic and Political Weekly, Vol. 21, No. 51 (Dec. 20, 1986), p. 2219 As a trade union organiser, Bangash was founder-president of the Sarhad Trade Union Federation. He also edited the weekly MKP magazine Sanober. =Travel abroad= On October 16, 1979, Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq declared martial law and intensified political repression. A number of serious charges were drawn up with which to frame Bangash in military courts, however they remained internal and were never made public. Afzal Bangash had numerous health problems, including chronic bronchitis, asthma, kidney failure, stroke, near blindness, diabetes, heart disease and hypertension. These health issues prompted him to travel abroad to the United Kingdom in 1979, to receive treatment. While staying in the UK he decided against returning to Pakistan for the time being, due to the situation in Pakistan. Instead, he remained active abroad in mobilizing opposition to the military rule of Zia-ul-Haq. During these years he also traveled extensively throughout western Europe, and made trips to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the United States, Cuba, India and Mongolia. He also traveled to Afghanistan. After the Saur Revolution in 1978, Hafizullah Amin had come to power and during Bangash's visit to Afghanistan they spoke together. Amin wanted Bangash to turn the MKP into a Pakistani party allied with his Khalq faction thereby extending the revolution into Pakistan. However, Bangash refused this and instead admonished Amin advising him to take local culture and norms into consideration. In 1981 the MKP helped found the Movement for the Restoration of Democracy (MRD), and Bangash worked with Benazir Bhutto during that era. On 31 March 1985, in London and together with Ataullah Mengal, Mumtaz Bhutto and Hafiz Pirzada, he formed the Sindhi Baloch Pushtoon Front (SBPF) demanding a confederal structure for Pakistan to guarantee the rights of smaller nationalities and counter what they perceived as a Punjabi establishment's hegemony of Pakistan. =Return to Pakistan= After the lifting of martial law and induction of a civilian government in 1985, political activity was revived in Pakistan and in mid-1986 Afzal Bangash returned to his home country.Afzal Bangash: A Life Dedicated to Militant Struggle, Feroz Ahmed, Economic and Political Weekly, Vol. 21, No. 51 (Dec. 20, 1986), p. 2219 He resided at his house at Kohat Road in Peshawar and remained involved with merging leftist parties including supporting the fateful decision to merge the MKP with Khan Abdul Wali Khan's National Democratic Party (NDP) thus creating the new Awami National Party (ANP) and ending a nearly two decade-long dispute with Wali Khan. Other parties included in this merger were a faction of the PNP and Rasool Paleejo‚Äôs Awami Tehrik.

Recently, his remains have been transferred back to Shadi Khel in Kohat, in accordance with the burial wishes of Bangash. Political views Although Afzal Bangash had a good grasp of the fundamentals of revolutionary theory and Marxist method of analysis, he never pretended to be a theoretician. He detested the idea of revolutionary theory without practice, and laid great emphasis on revolutionary militant action. Apart from writing articles in Sanober, he also translated an Urdu book on historical materialism into Pashto.Afzal Bangash: A Life Dedicated to Militant Struggle, Feroz Ahmed, Economic and Political Weekly, Vol. 21, No. 51 (Dec. 20, 1986), p. 2219 Bangash did not consider himself a Maoist, and was opposed to the Chinese invasion of Vietnam, in contrast to many of his colleagues who endorsed it. He did not believe in importing or exporting revolutions, but instead believed in indigenous struggle, with mass mobilization of oppressed people through an astute leadership. In an agrarian society the vanguard of such a struggle would be the peasantry.Dr Mohammad Taqi \\"Afzal Bangash: the Marxist maverick\\", Daily Times, 28 October 2010. Retrieved on 2016-09-20.

Known for its immigrant heritage and bohemian history, the architecture of the South Village is primarily tenement-style apartment buildings, indicative of the area's history as an enclave for Italian-American immigrants and working-class residents of New York. The South Village is roughly bounded by West 4th Street and Washington Square Park on the north, Seventh Avenue South and Varick Street on the west,Dolkart (2006), \\"Foreword\\", p. iii Canal Street on the south, and West Broadway and LaGuardia Place on the east. West Broadway separates the predominantly residential South Village from SoHo, dominated by factory and loft buildings, to the east.Sullivan‚ÄìThompson Historic District: Designation Report, December 13, 2016. The South Village includes the Charlton‚ÄìKing‚ÄìVandam Historic District, the MacDougal‚ÄìSullivan Gardens Historic District, and the Sullivan‚ÄìThompson Historic District. History Originally home to a merchant class in the early 19th century, by the late 19th century the area was dominated by immigrants, largely from Italy. The Italian immigrants built their own distinct parishes, to distinguish them not only from their Protestant neighbors on the north side of Washington Square Park (in Greenwich Village), but their Irish neighbors in the South Village. By the late 19th century, Italians outnumbered the Irish in the area, but were not preeminent in the local church hierarchy, especially the parish of St. Patrick's, which covered this area. In response, the Italian-American communities of the South Village built Our Lady of Pompeii and St. Anthony of Padua churches, which remain the area's defining religious edifices.Dolkart (2006), \\"A History of the South Village: Population Change in the Tenements of the South Village\\", pp.41-48 The Italian-American community was very poor, and its parish churches often had to be subsidized by third parties; Our Lady of Pompeii Church was the personal charity of a woman named Annie Leary who is buried in the crypt of Old St. Patrick's Cathedral.Morris, Charles R. (1997) American Catholic. New York: Times Books. p.129 By the 1920s, however ‚Äì the Village having fallen out of fashion with New York's patricians ‚Äì artists, bohemians, and radical thinkers began to populate the area, and the institutions which served them, such as jazz clubs and speakeasies became commonplace throughout the area. By the 1950s and 1960s, many of these had become coffeehouses and folk clubs for hippies, beatniks, and artists. These South Village establishments were frequented by some of the most significant players in these cultural movements, including Bob Dylan, Jack Kerouac, James Agee, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Sam Shepard and Jackson Pollock.  Preservation  The South Village was left out of the Greenwich Village Historic District designated by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) in 1969, though Village activists had pushed to include much of it. Perhaps because much of the significant history of the area was relatively recent, associated with the Beats, the Folk Revival, and modern American Theater and progressive education ‚Äì and because the architecture was more reflective of the Village's late 19th- and early 20th- century working-class, immigrant evolution, rather than its 19th-century patrician origins ‚Äì the area was sidestepped for inclusion in the historic district. There was much speculation that New York University, located on its edges and in its midst, may have also played a role in the area's exclusion. Two small sections of the area were designated early on by the LPC, however, as well as being listed on the New York State and National Registers of Historic Places: the Charlton-King-Vandam Historic District in 1966, and the MacDougal-Sullivan Gardens Historic District in 1967. Several buildings also were individually landmarked, including Judson Memorial Church; 26, 28, and 30 Jones Street; 203 Prince Street; and 83, 85, and 116 Sullivan Street. The neighborhood remained relatively free of demolitions and out-of-scale new development until the 1980s, when New York University (NYU) erected the high- rise D'Agostino Hall on West Third Street. The pace of change quickened in the late 1990s and early 2000s with the demolition of the historic Poe House and Judson Houses on West Third Street by NYU to make way for the new Furman Hall Law School Building. The relatively modest, mid-century modern NYU Skirball Student Center on Washington Square South also was demolished to make way for the considerably larger and more prominent NYU Kimmel Student Center, which was criticized for blocking the view downtown through Washington Square Arch. This increased calls for landmark and zoning protections for the South Village, which became a campaign led by the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation (GVSHP). = Renewing the call = The GVSHP researched the history of every one of approximately 750 buildings in the 25-block area and commissioned noted architectural historian Andrew Dolkart to write a history of the area to buttress GVSHP's proposal for a South Village Historic District.Dolkart (2006) The report, research, and landmarking proposal were submitted to the LPC in December 2006. The LPC divided the proposed district into three sections, promising to consider only one at a time. While the Commission considered the proposal, several key buildings were lost, including the Tunnel Garage, an early Art Deco building; the Provincetown Playhouse and Apartments, demolished by NYU to make way for another Law School building; the Circle in the Square Theater, the first non-profit theater; an 1861 rowhouse at 178 Bleecker Street; and 186 Spring Street, an 1824 rowhouse which gay activists and GVSHP rallied to save because it served as the home to some of the most important and influential figures in the post-Stonewall LGBT rights movement. The first phase of GVSHP's proposed South Village Historic District, covering approximately 11 blocks and 235 buildings west of Sixth Avenue, were landmarked in 2010, officially designated the \\"Greenwich Village Historic District Extension II\\" ‚Äì or more informally, the \\"South Village Extension\\" of the Greenwich Village Historic District. After this, the LPC stalled on the two remaining phases of the proposed South Village Historic District, in spite of promises to move ahead. In 2012, developer Trinity Real Estate applied for a rezoning of the adjacent Hudson Square area, which would require the approval of both the NYC Planning Commission and City Council. The proposed rezoning would have allowed high-rise residential development in the manufacturing district directly bordering the South Village, which according to the developer's own draft environmental impact statement, would have had a \\"direct adverse impact\\" upon the remaining, un-landmarked part of the proposed South Village Historic District. In its part of the environmental review for the proposed Hudson Square rezoning (which included an examination of all potential historic resources within a 400-foot radius of the proposed rezoning), the LPC also acknowledged that the remaining un-landmarked portion of the proposed South Village Historic District was \\"landmark-eligible\\". = Rezoning politics = The Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation used this potential harm to spearhead a campaign to insist that the City Council not approve the Hudson Square Rezoning unless the proposed South Village Historic District was also approved. This put pressure on City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, who represented the area. Quinn had long claimed to support designation of the proposed South Village Historic District, but had not exerted any political pressure to get the City to act. GVSHP waged a letter-writing campaign, took out ads in local papers, and published op-eds demanding that Quinn vote down the rezoning unless she was also able to get the city to move ahead with the long-delayed South Village Historic District. The strategy partly paid off. On March 13, 2013, the City Council announced an agreement by the city to move ahead before year's end with Phase II of GVSHP's proposed South Village Historic District ‚Äì the area east of Sixth Avenue and north of Houston Street, as well as to survey Phase III ‚Äì the area south of Houston Street. While GVSHP and other advocates claimed victory, they pointed out the shortcomings in the Quinn-brokered deal: the landmarking would not take effect until months after the rezoning, which was to be voted on that spring; the deal only included a commitment to survey Phase III, with no assurances about the outcome of the survey; and even the Phase II commitment was nebulous, in that no boundaries for the proposed district were offered, and the commitment of \\"a vote\\" by year's end did not guarantee passage. When the LPC announced its proposed boundaries for Phase II ‚Äì to be called \\"The South Village Historic District\\" ‚Äì in April 2013, several key sites were excluded from the district, including two NYU properties, the Kevorkian Center and Vanderbilt Hall, the latter of which occupied a full block on Washington Square South and could have, under existing zoning and without landmark protections, been replaced with a -tall dorm. GVSHP called for the proposed district to be expanded to include the two NYU sites and a row of ten altered 1840s houses on West Houston Street, and began a campaign to convince Speaker Quinn, who brokered the deal, to pressure the LPC to bring these sites into the proposed district. The strategy again worked, and the LPC and Quinn announced in May that the three sites, along with another NYU building, D'Agostino Hall, which was surrounded by the other sites, would be formally added into the proposed district for consideration. At the time of the scheduled vote in December 2013, the LPC could vote to exclude any site from the district or deny landmark status to the entire proposed district. By that time Quinn, who was running for mayor and thus sensitive to pressure, would be past her election bid. =Designation= The LPC voted to designate the South Village Historic District on December 17, 2013. From the beginning, the LPC expressed skepticism of the landmark-worthiness of the row of ten houses on West Houston Street, and they did in fact exclude those houses. However, in a victory for GVSHP and other advocates of the landmark campaign, LPC designated more than 250 buildings on more than a dozen blocks in the South Village, including the NYU buildings ‚Äì even the full-block Vanderbilt Hall with its potential for replacement by a -tall dorm. At the end of December, LPC Chairman Robert B. Tierney wrote to GVSHP saying that the Commission's survey found the third phase of the proposed South Village Historic District was unworthy of landmark designation, and therefore the LPC would not be moving ahead with consideration of it. However, with a new Mayor taking office in January 2014, Bill de Blasio, Tierney was replaced. GVSHP and advocates are continuing the campaign to landmark the entire South Village, including the Phase III area south of Houston Street. In December 2013, GVSHP's nomination of the entire South Village to the State and National Registers of Historic Places was accepted, and the South Village was formally listed in the State and National Registers of Historic Places in the spring of 2014. The LPC held a public hearing on Phase III ‚Äì which it referred to as the \\"Sullivan-Thompson Historic District\\" ‚Äì in late November 2016, which provoked a \\"spirited debate\\". Politicians such as Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer, New York State Assemblyperson Deborah Glick, and City Council member Corey Johnson, had voiced their support for the project, and Johnson has attempted to use his support for the proposed district as leverage for the rezoning and redevelopment of St. John's Terminal at 550 Washington Street, using air rights from the city-owned Pier 40. The proposed five-building complex would have a hotel, of retail space, and more than 1,500 apartments.Gourarie, Chava (October 20, 2016) \\"City plans to extend the South Village Historic District\\" The Real Deal Organizations that spoke in favor of the historic district included the GVSHP, the New York Landmarks Conservancy ‚Äì whose representative, Gale Umberger, said \\"This district is part of the narrative of New York City\\" ‚Äì and the Historic Districts Council, whose representative said that the proposed district \\"most notably demonstrates New York City's evolution of housing development spanning two centuries\\". Concerns were expressed about the Trump SoHo, which was said to be out of character for the neighborhood, and the recent real estate purchases in the area by Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's son-in-law. Others, such as Joseph Rosenberg of the Catholic Community Relations Council, said that the landmarking of Phase III would put an undue burden on St. Anthony of Padua Church and the work it does for the immigrant community, and some residents complained that landmarking would make the upkeep of their buildings more difficult and expensive, with one remarking \\"Landmarking our block will force us to sell our building as we'll no longer be able to afford to maintain it. You will have created a museum but destroyed a community.\\"Rosenberg, Zoe (November 29, 2016) \\"Proposed Sullivan-Thompson Historic District elicits support, dissent at LPC\\" Curbed New YorkBockmann, Rich (November 30, 2016) \\"Plan for extended South Village Historic District gets mixed reception at hearing\\" The Real Deal On December 13, 2016, the LPC voted to create the Sullivan-Thompson Historic District.Staff (December 13, 2016) \\"Commission Designated Sullivan-Thompson as New York City Historic District\\" (press release) New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission Sites and attractions *Father Demo Square *Our Lady of Pompeii Church *Greenwich House *Provincetown Playhouse *San Remo *The Bitter End *Caffe Cino Transportation New York City Subway service is located at: *West Fourth Street ‚Äì Washington Square at Sixth Avenue; serving the *Spring Street at Sixth Avenue; serving the *Canal Street at Sixth Avenue; serving the New York City Bus routes in the area include .

Early career In 1908 after training in cadet school von Hanneken joined the army as a F√§hnrich. A year later he was promoted to Leutnant. In April 1917 he was transferred to the General Staff, and the year after he was promoted to Hauptmann. World War I In 1915 von Hanneken became Oberleutnant and aide to a regiment in World War I. In July 1916 von Hanneken was transferred to the 260th Reserve-Infantry-Regiment, where he served as leader of the Machine Gun- Company. Interbellum After the war von Hanneken was in 1919 among the officers who joined the German Reichswehr. Then he took a job in Reichswehr Ministry where he was the next year. Then from 1924 to 1927 he was transferred to Reichwaffenamt (materiel command). From 1927 he led troops as a company commander, and it continued until in 1930 when he was promoted to Major. Three years later he was again promoted to Oberstleutnant. From 1935 he had command of a regiment and was thus promoted to Oberst. A year later, in 1936, he was transferred to Heereswaffenamt (materiel command), where he became Chief of Staff. On 3 July 1937, he became responsible for the purchase of iron and steel. On 1 September 1939 he was appointed Head of Section II (Industrial) in the ministry of commercial. In 1940 he received the position as vice Secretary of State. That same year he was promoted to Generalleutnant and in 1941 he was General der Infanterie. World War II After the outbreak of World War II a supply crisis in the iron and steel division caused him problems, and only could save him. Delivery time had increased dramatically because over a period of two years von Hanneken had approved supplies that exceeded the amount of iron and steel that could be delivered. Hans Kehrl said nothing about this in its public records, but his caseworker did in return. Kehrl wrote in his memoirs that von Hanneken was not sufficiently decisive and was afraid of conflict. von Hanneken was also responsible for addressing the issues of coal to the steel industry. So on 6 June 1941 he raised at the 11th meeting in the problem that the demand for coal in the last four years had risen faster than supply. The European countries which were dependent on German coal only got 60% of the claimed amounts. From April 1941 domestic coal consumers had to accept a reduction of supplies of around 10%. This led to many closures of companies or reduction of operations. Domestic energy suppliers had to accept a reduction in coal consumption of 20%. In March / April 1942 von Hanneken was denied responsibility for the distribution of iron and steel, which were transferred to the so-called central planning. As a result of further changes in the tasks of Section II largely transferred to other bodies so Hanneken went on holiday in August 1942 and left Section II in October. On 12 October 1942 he took over the duties of Erich L√ºdke as commander of the German forces in Denmark. He was responsible for defending the invasion and took a tougher line against the Danish resistance movement, which brought him into conflict with Werner Best. On 29 August 1943 von Hanneken imposed martial law in Denmark. It was the result of growing unrest, strikes and sabotage in the months before. Simultaneously, the Danish army and navy were dissolved and their personnel interned. von Hanneke was made aware of but was not otherwise involved in the action against the Danish Jews in early October 1943 led by G√ºnther Pancke. On 19 September 1944 he backtracked over the dissolution of the Danish police. In January 1945 he was released from his command and replaced by Georg Lindemann. He was accused of corruption and by the German National-martial sentenced 8 years imprisonment. He was, however, pardoned by Adolf Hitler, who thought that they could not afford the luxury of letting von Hanneken sit in jail. Instead, von Hanneken was demoted to Major and sent to the front. At the end of the war he became an American prisoner. From there, he was extradited to Denmark, where in 1948 he was sentenced to 8 years imprisonment. At the Court he was acquitted on 9 May 1949. He was expelled from Denmark and lived thereafter retracted until his death in 1981.

It is potentially important in epigenetics, because the hydroxymethyl group on the cytosine can possibly switch a gene on and off. It was first seen in bacteriophages in 1952. However, in 2009 it was found to be abundant in human and mouse brains, as well as in embryonic stem cells. In mammals, it can be generated by oxidation of 5-methylcytosine, a reaction mediated by TET enzymes. Its molecular formula is C5H7N3O2. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine, nextbio.com Localization Every mammalian cell seems to contain 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine, but the levels vary significantly depending on the cell type. The highest levels are found in neuronal cells of the central nervous system. The amount of hydroxymethylcytosine increases with age, as shown in mouse hippocampus and cerebellum. Function The exact function of this nitrogen base is still not fully elucidated, but it is thought that it may regulate gene expression or prompt DNA demethylation. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that artificial DNA that contains 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC) can be converted into unmodified cytosines once introduced into mammalian cells. Moreover, 5hmC is highly enriched in primordial germ cells, where it apparently plays a role in global DNA demethylation. Additionally, 5-Formylcytosine, an oxidation product of 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine and possible intermediate of an oxidative demethylation pathway was detected in DNA from embryonic stem cells, although no significant amounts of these putative demethylation intermediates could be detected in mouse tissue. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine may be especially important in the central nervous system, as it is found in very high levels there. Reduction in the 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine levels have been found associated with impaired self-renewal in embryonic stem cells. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine is also associated with labile, unstable nucleosomes which are frequently repositioned during cell differentiation. The accumulation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in post-mitotic neurons is associated with ‚Äúfunctional demethylation‚Äù that facilitates transcription and gene expression. The term ‚Äúdemethylation,‚Äù as applied to neurons, ordinarily refers to the replacement of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) by cytosine in DNA that can occur through a series of reactions involving a TET enzyme as well as enzymes of the DNA base excision repair pathway (see Epigenetics in learning and memory). ‚ÄúDemethylation‚Äù of 5mC in DNA most often results in the promotion of expression of genes with neuronal activities. ‚ÄúFunctional demethylation‚Äù refers to the replacement of 5mC by 5hmC, ordinarily a single-step TET- mediated reaction, that also facilitates gene expression, an effect similar to that of ‚Äúdemethylation.‚Äù  Bacteria and phages  Phages probably evolved to use 5hmC to avoid recogniztion by most restriction enzymes in bacteria. The T4 phage uses 5hmC exclusively during replication, adding glycosylation to the hydroxyl group to further complicate the moiety. Some bacteria have in turn evolved restriction enzymes specific for sites containing 5hmC. One prominent example is PvuRts1I, originally identified in 1994. 5hmC in T4 is produced by genome protein 42, deoxycytidylate 5-hydroxymethyltransferase (; EC 2.1.2.8). The glycosylation reactions are known as EC 2.4.1.26, EC 2.4.1.27, and EC 2.4.1.28. History 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine was observed by Skirmantas Kriaucionis, an associate at the Heintz lab, who was looking for levels of 5-methylcytosine in two different neuron types. He discovered a significant amount of an unknown substance instead, and after conducting several tests, identified it as being 5-hydroxymethylcytosine.A, T, G, C and What?, popsci.com The lab of L. Aravind used bioinformatic tools to predict that the Tet family of enzymes would likely oxidize 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. This was demonstrated in vitro and in live human and mouse cells by scientists working in the labs of Anjana Rao and David R. Liu. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine was originally observed in mammals in 1972 by R. Yura, but this initial finding is dubious. Yura found 5-hmC present at extremely high levels in rat brain and liver, completely supplanting 5-methylcytosine. This contradicts all research conducted on mammalian DNA composition conducted before and since, including the Heintz and Rao papers, and another group was unable to reproduce Yura's result. With the discovery of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine some concerns have been raised regarding DNA methylation studies using the bisulfite sequencing technique. 5-hydroxymethylcytosine has been shown to behave like its precursor, 5-methylcytosine, in bisulfite conversion experiments.Jin SG et al. (Jun 2010) \\"Examination of the specificity of DNA methylation profiling techniques towards 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine.\\" Nucleic Acids Res. 2010 Jun 1;38(11):e125 Therefore, bisulfite sequencing data may need to be revisited to verify whether the detected modified base is 5-methylcytosine or 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. In 2012 the lab of Chuan He discovered a method to solve the problems of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine being detected as 5-methylcytosine in normal bisulfite conversion experiments using the oxidative properties of the Tet-family of enzymes, this method has been termed TAB-seq. In June 2020, Oxford Nanopore added a hydroxymethyl cytosine detection model to their research basecaller, rerio, allowing old signal-level data from any R9+ nanopore runs to be re-called to identify 5hmC.

Features Web storage differs from cookies in some key ways. ; Purpose : Cookies are intended for communication with server; they are automatically added to all requests and can be accessed by both the server and client side. Web storage falls exclusively under the purview of client-side scripting. Web storage data is not automatically transmitted to the server in every HTTP request, and a web server can't directly write to Web storage. However, either of these effects can be achieved with explicit client-side scripts, allowing for fine-tuning of the desired interaction with the server. ; Storage size : Cookies are restricted to 4 kilobytes.

Microsoft Developer Network, msdn.microsoft.com. Retrieved on 2014-08-05. ; Local and session storage : Web storage offers two different storage areas‚Äîlocal storage and session storage‚Äîwhich differ in scope and lifetime. Data placed in local storage is per origin‚Äîthe combination of protocol, host name, and port number as defined in the same-origin policy. The data is available to all scripts loaded from pages from the same origin that previously stored the data and persists after the browser is closed. As such, Web storage does not suffer from cookie Weak Integrity and Weak Confidentiality issues, described in sections 8.5 and 8.6. Session storage is both per-origin and per-instance (per-window or per-tab) and is limited to the lifetime of the instance. Session storage is intended to allow separate instances of the same web app to run in different windows without interfering with each other, a use case that's not well supported by cookies.W3C: Web Storage draft standard.

Retrieved on 2011-06-12. ; Interface and data model : Web storage provides a better programmatic interface than cookies because it exposes an associative array data model where the keys and values are both strings.

Usage Browsers that support web storage have the global objects \`sessionStorage\` and \`localStorage\` declared at the window level. The following JavaScript code can be used on these browsers to trigger web storage behavior: // Store value on browser for duration of the session sessionStorage.setItem('key', 'value'); // Retrieve value (gets deleted when browser is closed and re-opened) ... alert(sessionStorage.getItem('key')); // Store value on the browser beyond the duration of the session localStorage.setItem('key', 'value'); // Retrieve value (persists even after closing and re-opening the browser) alert(localStorage.getItem('key')); Only strings can be stored via the Storage API.W3C, 2011 http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/ Attempting to store a different data type will result in an automatic conversion into a string in most browsers. Conversion into JSON, however, allows for effective storage of JavaScript objects. // Store an object instead of a string localStorage.setItem('key', {name: 'value'}); alert(typeof localStorage.getItem('key')); // string // Store an integer instead of a string localStorage.setItem('key', 1); alert(typeof localStorage.getItem('key')); // string // Store an object using JSON localStorage.setItem('key', JSON.stringify({name: 'value'})); alert(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('key')).name); // value Nomenclature The W3C draft is titled \\"Web Storage\\". \\"DOM storage\\" has also been a commonly used name, though it is becoming less so; for example the \\"DOM Storage\\" web articles of the Mozilla and Microsoft developer sites have been replaced with \\"Web Storage\\" articles.

The helicopter was funded by the Kent Air Ambulance Trust (under the operating name of the Kent Air Ambulance Fund), which was a registered charity, raising money from public and private donations in excess of ¬£4m every year between Kent, Sussex and Surrey. In June 2007, the service extended it areas of operation to Surrey and Sussex requiring an additional helicopter. It now operates as Air Ambulance Kent Surrey Sussex. Overview and history The service was operated by the Kent Air Ambulance Trust, a registered charity established in 1989. The trust was founded by Kate Chivers (in whose honour the helicopter was named), and was originally called the South East Thames Air Ambulance. Initially operated on a part-time basis, the air ambulance became a seven-day service in January 2000 and shortly afterwards moved from its original Rochester Airport base to Marden near Maidstone. It operated one McDonnell Douglas MD902 Explorer helicopter (registration G-KAAT) from Marden. This location, combined with its high cruise speed, quoted by the manufacturer as in excess of 150 mph, enabled the crew to reach almost all of the county within 15 minutes of takeoff (the exception being the farther reaches of Thanet which may take up to 20 minutes to reach). In March 2008, it was announced that the trust would be collaborating with Sussex Police to provide a night time rescue service utilising the Sussex Police Air Operations Unit helicopter, Hotel 900, which is equipped to fly at night. Prior to this, the service was restricted to daylight operation only. The ¬£1.6m that it cost to run each year was funded almost entirely by voluntary donations and fund- raising, such as the sale of its own lottery tickets, as it received little government, National Lottery or NHS funding. The service flew over 12,000 missions since its inception. 1998 crash Memorial to the crash of the Kent Air Ambulance in 1998 In July 1998, the air ambulance, a Eurocopter AS355 Twin Squirrel, registration G-MASK, crashed in good weather after colliding with power cables near Burham while returning to Rochester Airport following an aborted call to attend a road accident. All three crew - the pilot, Graham Budden, and two paramedics, Tony Richardson and Mark Darby - were killed as the helicopter burst into flames on impact. Initial investigation established no cause for the crash, due to the fireball produced on impact. Initially the pilot's employers, Police Aviation Services, denied liability. On 19 February 2004, following a civil case brought by the pilot's widow to the High Court in Manchester, it was ruled that the crash was caused by mechanical failure not, as had been suggested, flying low for fun, and ordered compensation to be paid. A memorial to the crew is located at the Blue Bell Hill picnic site, close to the scene of the crash. Expansion In June 2007, following a two- year fundraising campaign, spearheaded by Penelope Keith, the trust began operating a second helicopter from a new base at Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey, serving the Surrey and Sussex area. This newer service operated as the Surrey and Sussex Air Ambulance. This aircraft was subsequently relocated to Redhill Aerodrome and was capable of night flight.

History He founded the Vollaro clan during the mid-seventies. During his tenure as a Camorra boss, Vollaro earned the nickname \\"'o Califfo\\" (The Caliph) for his alleged unlimited sexual potency. When he eventually was arrested in 1982, the police found that Vollaro was living in a concubinage with 17 women and had 27 children.

Football career Hodgkinson was born at Pembroke Dock in South Wales, but grew up in Derbyshire. His first professional club was Derby County before he joined Grimsby Town of the Football League Second Division in October 1903. After a season at Blundell Park, in which he made seventeen appearances, scoring five goals, Hodgkinson moved in May 1904 to Devon, where he joined Plymouth Argyle of the Southern League. This was followed by seasons with Leicester Fosse of the Second Division and Bury in the First Division. In May 1907, Hodgkinson returned to the Southern League when he joined Southampton, along with his Bury teammate John Johnston. Described by the Saints' historians, Holley and Chalk, as \\"a consistent performer with all his previous clubs\\", Hodgkinson was \\"still developing as a dashing outside-left\\" when he came to Southampton. He made his debut for the Saints on 7 September 1907, when he scored in a 3‚Äì2 defeat at home to Crystal Palace. He soon formed useful partnerships with his fellow Welsh forward John Lewis and with George Smith, going on to make 29 appearances in 1907‚Äì08, scoring nine goals as Southampton finished the league season in mid-table. He also played in all six FA Cup matches as Saints reached the semi-finals, losing to Wolverhampton Wanderers who went on to take the cup in the final. The FA Cup Fourth Round tie against Everton played at Goodison Park on Saturday 7 March 1908 was a 0‚Äì0 draw. The replay was arranged for the following Tuesday, but was put back by one day to allow Hodgkinson to attend the funeral of his brother, William Henry Hodgkinson, who had died, aged 26, on the Saturday. As a mark of respect, the Saints players wore black armbands. Saints won the replay 3‚Äì2, with two goals from \\"man-of-the-match\\", Frank Costello. Hodgkinson is described by Holley & Chalk as > \\"a mercurial player, who would suddenly achieve the sensational only to, > just as suddenly, disappear from prominence; he also rarely did what his > opponents expected of him.\\" His reputation grew during his time at The Dell and on 11 April 1908, he played for Wales against Ireland; the match, held at the Athletic Ground, Aberdare ended in a 1‚Äì0 victory for the Irish.

The recording, made during the first leg of the 1987 Clutching at Straws tour, documents the band at the peak of their commercial success in the 1980s when they had original frontman Fish on vocals. The show was attended by an audience of 20,000; support acts were Magnum, The Cult (cancelled), and It Bites. It comprises songs from the four studio albums they released up to that point, i.e. Script for a Jester's Tear (1983), Fugazi (1984), Misplaced Childhood (1985), and Clutching at Straws (1987). The non-album debut single \\"Market Square Heroes\\" is also included. The cover uses the original 1987 concert poster designed by Fish-era Marillion (and later Fish solo) graphic artist Mark Wilkinson. It shows the central character from the cover of the then-current single \\"Incommunicado\\" above a drawing of the characteristic marquee above the venue's stage. Release history A video recording of this concert had first been released on VHS tape in November 1987, and re-released in 1995, then packaged together with an audio CD (one disc) including the soundtrack of the VHS tape except \\"Incubus\\". This 'Sound & Vision' video recording, since out of print, was re-issued on DVD in August 2004. On 22 June 2009, EMI released the recording a fourth time, this time as a digitally remastered double audio CD including four tracks that had been omitted from the previous video and audio versions (\\"White Russian\\", \\"Fugazi\\", \\"Garden Party\\" and \\"Market Square Heroes\\"). The version of \\"White Russian\\" found on the 2009 issue had previously been released on the B-side \\"Warm Wet Circles\\" (1987). On the same day, EMI released Recital of the Script, another first-time audio version of a 1980s live video. Although neither Marillion nor ex-singer Fish were involved in the decision to re-release this material, they officially approved it and Fish has written liner notes for both. Fish commented that \\"as contractually we have no control over the material [we] decided it would be more advisable to help out rather than relinquish total responsibility. (...) I understand there will be accusations of \\"scraping the barrel\\" directed at EMI, and perhaps there is some justification, but (...) our choice was to walk away and let Amazon and the like benefit or get involved and at least try and get some return above the pennies we get as royalties as a band under our old contract.\\" Track listing (2009 double audio CD)Disc 1= #\\"Sl√†inte Mhath\\" (from Clutching at Straws, 1987) ‚Äì 5:14 #\\"Assassing\\" (from Fugazi, 1984) ‚Äì 7:07 #\\"Script for a Jester's Tear\\" (from Script for a Jester's Tear, 1983) ‚Äì 9:45 #\\"White Russian\\" (from Clutching at Straws, 1987) ‚Äì 6:48 #\\"Incubus\\" (from Fugazi, 1984) ‚Äì 9:21 #\\"Sugar Mice\\" (from Clutching at Straws, 1987) ‚Äì 6:34 #\\"Fugazi\\" (from Fugazi, 1984) ‚Äì 8:23 =Disc 2= #\\"Hotel Hobbies\\" (from Clutching at Straws, 1987) ‚Äì 4:15 #\\"Warm Wet Circles\\" (from Clutching at Straws, 1987) ‚Äì 4:19 #\\"That Time of the Night (The Short Straw)\\" (from Clutching at Straws, 1987) ‚Äì 6:03 #\\"Kayleigh\\" (from Misplaced Childhood, 1985) ‚Äì 4:22 #\\"Lavender\\" (from Misplaced Childhood, 1985) ‚Äì 2:38 #\\"Bitter Suite (Medley)\\" (from Misplaced Childhood, 1985) ‚Äì 7:39 #\\"Heart of Lothian\\" (from Misplaced Childhood, 1985) ‚Äì 4:24 #\\"The Last Straw\\" (from Clutching at Straws, 1987) ‚Äì 6:23 #\\"Incommunicado\\" (from Clutching at Straws, 1987) ‚Äì 6:13 #\\"Garden Party\\" (from Script for a Jester's Tear, 1983) ‚Äì 7:13 #\\"Market Square Heroes\\" (non-album single, 1982) ‚Äì 11:32 Track listing (earlier versions) 1987 VHS tape, 1995 VHS tape+audio CD package, 2004 DVD #\\"Sl√†inte Mhath\\" #\\"Assassing\\" #\\"Script for a Jester's Tear\\" #\\"Incubus\\" (not on the 1995 audio CD) #\\"Sugar Mice\\" #\\"Hotel Hobbies\\" #\\"Warm Wet Circles\\" #\\"That Time of the Night\\" #\\"Kayleigh\\" #\\"Lavender\\" #\\"Bitter Suite\\" #\\"Heart of Lothian\\" #\\"The Last Straw\\" #\\"Incommunicado\\" Personnel *Fish ‚Äì vocals *Steve Rothery ‚Äì guitars *Mark Kelly ‚Äì keyboards *Pete Trewavas ‚Äì bass, backing vocals *Ian Mosley ‚Äì drums *Cori Josias ‚Äì backing vocals ReferencesExternal links *Entry on marillion.com *Entry on Fish's site the-company.com Category:2009 live albums Category:Marillion live albums ","title":"Live from Loreley"},{"id":"22792304","text":"Iraqi Jewish cuisine: Kubbeh matfuniya Moroccan pickled lemons Mizrahi Jewish cuisine is an assortment of cooking traditions that developed among the Jews of the Middle East, North Africa, Asia, and Arab countries. Mizrahi Jews have also been known as Oriental Jews (Mizrahi is Hebrew: Eastern or Oriental). Jews of the Mizrahi communities cook foods that were and are popular in their home countries, while following the laws of kashrut. The cuisine is based largely on fresh ingredients, as marketing was done in the local souq. Meat is ritually slaughtered in the shehita process, and is soaked and salted. Meat dishes are a prominent feature of sabbath, festival, and celebratory meals. Cooked, stuffed and baked vegetables are central to the cuisine, as are various kinds of beans, chickpeas, lentils and burghul (cracked wheat). Rice takes the place of potatoes. History Tahina with lemon and garlic, a staple of Mizrahi Jewish cuisine as a dip or cooking sauce Mizrahi Jews are the Jews of the Middle East, and points south and east, largely along the Mediterranean coastal areas and the Levant. In some countries, there was much mixing of populations after 1492 when the Jews were expelled from Spain. Cuisine of the Mizrahi Jews includes the cuisines of the Jews of Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Iran (Persia), Afghanistan, Bukhara (Uzbekistan), Egypt, the Berber communities, Kurdistan, Eastern Caucasus and Georgia. Some of these communities and cuisine styles overlap with Sephardic communities who fled to many Eastern, Middle Eastern, and North African countries after the Spanish expulsion. Coming from the Mediterranean and \\"sunny\\" climes, Mizrahi cuisine is often light, with an emphasis on salads, stuffed vegetables and vine leaves, olive oil, lentils, fresh and dried fruits, herbs and nuts, and chickpeas. Meat dishes often make use of lamb or ground beef. Fresh lemon juice is added to many soups and sauces. Many meat and rice dishes incorporate dried fruits such as apricots, prunes and raisins. Pine nuts are used as a garnish. Pomegranate juice is a staple of Persian Jewish cooking. Kubbeh, a meat-stuffed bulgur dumpling, features in the cooking of many Mizrahi communities. It is served in the cooking broth, as a kind of soup. Breads Flatbreads of many varieties are the staple of the Mizrahi diet. Various flatbreads such as pitas, laffa, malawah, and lavash are used alongside challah. Lahoh is a flatbread of the Yemenite Jews with a spongy texture.See Kosher and Traditional Jewish Cooking: Authentic recipes from a classic culinary heritage: 150 delicious dishes shown in 250 stunning photographs, Marlena Spieler, Lorenz Books, UK 2008, p. 218 Herbs, spices and seasoning blends Couscous with vegetables and chickpeas Mizrahi cuisine makes liberal use of cumin, pepper, sesame seeds, and various spices common to all Middle Eastern cuisines.See The Book of Jewish Food: An Odyssey from Samarkand to New York, Claudia Roden, Knopf 1996, p. 232 Saffron, a staple of Sephardic cuisine, is also featured in certain Mizrahi dishes. Many dishes are flavored with seasoning blends or pastes, and light sauces. Hilbe, a paste made from fenugreek seeds and hot pepper, is added to soups and other traditional Yemenite dishes.A recipe for Yemenite hilbe Skhug, a hot pepper sauce, comes in red and green varieties. A diluted version of skhug is spooned over felafel. Hawaij is a Yemenite spice mixture that comes into two varieties. One, a blend of powdered ginger, cinnamon, cloves and cardamom, is added to coffee and baked goods. The other, a blend of turmeric, black pepper, onion, cumin, cardamom and cloves, is added to soup. Pastes and sauces are very often served on the side in small dishes on the table during meals, to be added by each diner as desired. Yaprak stuffed vine leaves Certain spice combinations are characteristic of particular countries, such as coriander and cumin in Egyptian cuisine.The Book of Jewish Food: An Odyssey from Samarkand to New York, Claudia Roden, Knopf 1996, p. 232 The souqs of the Middle East and North Africa sell ready-made spice blends sold in bulk, but traditionally, Mizrahi Jews bought fresh herbs and prepared their own blends at home to maintain kashruth, fearing insects in the blends sold in the open-air bazaar.See The Book of Jewish Food: An Odyssey from Samarkand to New York, Claudia Roden, Knopf, 2006, pg 234 * Adeni hawaij (Aden) - cumin, coriander, black pepper * Adeni black tea spice (Aden) - cardamom, cinnamon, cloves * Advieh-e halegh, halegh (charoset) spice (Iran) - It may contain: cinnamon, cloves, ginger, nutmeg, and cardamom (optional)Recipe for Persian halegh * Hawaij (Yemen) - black pepper, cardamom, turmeric, saffron * Kama (Morocco) - black pepper, cumin, ginger, turmeric, nutmeg * Quatre √©pices or four spices (Egypt) - cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cloves * Za'tar or zahtar - za'atar, thyme or hyssop with ground sesame seeds, sumac and salt Desserts Hot sahlab, a liquidy cornstarch pudding originally flavored with orchid powder (today invariably replaced by artificial flavorings), is served in cups as a winter drink, garnished with cinnamon, nuts, coconut and raisins. Arak from the Anis drinks family, is the preferred alcoholic beverage. Rosewater is a common ingredient in cakes and desserts. Malabi, a cold cornstarch pudding, is sprinkled with rosewater and red syrup. Ikaddaif or kadaif is a very sweet pastry similar in style and technique to baklavah. It consists of shredded dough, which is wrapped around crushed nuts, baked and then soaked in syrup. It is common in various parts of the Middle East and is served at festive meals.See Kosher and Traditional Jewish Cooking: Authentic recipes from a classic culinary heritage: 150 delicious dishes shown in 250 stunning photographs, Marlena Spieler, Lorenz Books, UK 2008 Cooking techniques As cooking on Shabbat is prohibited, Mizrahi Jews take advantage of slow cooking techniques, such as baking on a low temperature over night, to have available, hot dishes on the sabbath. This technique is virtually universal to all Jewish cuisines. One staple of this technique is Hamin or Chamin (from the word \\"kham,\\" which means \\"hot\\"). In north Africa this dish is known as Dafina. There are many varieties of hamin and Dafina, as particularly local spices and ingredients are used, as well as the method of preparation. Some varieties are denser than others, and some use rice as a staple instead of the common root vegetables. Bourekas are often served on Shabbat morning. In Yemenite cooking, Shabbat dishes include jachnun and kubbanah. Shabbat and holiday cooking Shabbat = Sabbath foods are often slow-cooked prior to Sabbath, and kept warm overnight once cooked, as cooking is forbidden on the Sabbath by Jewish Law. In Yemenite cooking, Shabbat dishes include jahnun and kubbanah. = Rosh Hashanah = Makroud are pastries stuffed with spiced dates and scented with orange-flower water prepared for Rosh Hashanah by Algerian Jews. Slow-cooked vegetables stuffed with meat are a popular holiday dish. Moroccan Jews season the stuffing with cinnamon, turmeric, and nutmeg. Holiday meals start with at least a dozen small salads.Rosh Hashana Recipes Routed Through Africa = Passover = Mizrahi cuisine allows the use of kitniyot, which is forbidden amongst the Ashkenazim. Kitniyot are legumes and some grains, which include rice and a variety of beans and pulses. Whereas charoset in Ashkenazi homes is a blend of chopped apples and nuts spiced with wine and cinnamon, Mizrahi charoset is often based on dried fruits, especially dates, and is much thicker in consistency. Other Mizrahi Jewish dishes are tebit, a chicken and rice dish, and ingriyi, sweet and sour meat topped with aubergines, both from the cuisine of Iraqi Jews.

Notably, Brophy and coworkers isolated the simpler carpacin, a phenylpropanoid with a 9-carbon framework, recognized its substructure as being dimerized within the complex carpanone structure,G.C. Brophy, J. Mohandas, M. Slaytor, T.R. Watson & L.A. Wilson, 1969, Novel lignans from a Cinnamomum sp. from Bougainville, Tetrahedron Lett. 10:5159-5162. and proposed a hypothesis of how carpacin was converted to carpanone in plant cells: Carpacin, an ortho-methoxystyrene, and a more common type of phenolic plant phenylpropanoid whose structure was recognized as being dimerized in carpanone * carpacin underwent loss of a methyl (-CH3) group from the ring methoxy (-OCH3) group to provide the phenol, desmethylcarpacin, * this phenol intermediate then underwent a phenolic coupling to generate a dimeric intermediate, which was * followed immediately by a Diels-Alder (4+2) cycloaddition reaction to create 2 new rings, to give the final carpanone product. Remarkably, within two years, Chapman and coworkers were able to chemically design a route to mimic this proposed biosynthetic route, and achieved the synthesis of carpanone from carpacin in a single \\"pot\\", in about 50% yield. Carpanone itself is limited in its pharmacologic and biologic activities, but related analogs arrived at by variations of the Brophy-Chapman approach have shown activities as tool compounds relevant to mammalian exocytosis and vesicular traffic,Brian C. Goess, Rami N. Hannoush, Lawrence K. Chan, Tomas Kirchhausen, and Matthew D. Shair, 2006, Synthesis of a 10,000-Membered Library of Molecules Resembling Carpanone and Discovery of Vesicular Traffic Inhibitors, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 128(16): 5391‚Äì5403, DOI: 10.1021/ja056338g, see , accessed 4 June 2014. and provided therapeutic \\"hits\\" in antiinfective, antihypertensive, and hepatoprotective areas. The original Chapman design and synthesis is considered a classic in total synthesis, and one that highlights the power of biomimetic synthesis. Total synthesis The first total synthesis of carpanone was the biomimetic approach published by Chapman et al. in 1971. The required desmethylcarpacin (2-allylsesamol), shown below as the starting molecule in the scheme, is acquired in two high-yield steps involving three transformations: * allylation of the phenolic anion generated after treatment of sesamol with potassium carbonate and allyl bromide, * followed by a thermal Claisen rearrangement to move the O-allyl group onto the adjacent site on the aromatic ring, and then * thermal isomerization of the Claisen product, to move the terminal olefin (alkene) into conjugation with the ring (with e.g., potassium tert-butoxide as base). This procedure is one of several that gives the required desmethylcarpacin (carpacin with the methyl of its methoxy group removed). Though oxidative dimerizations of phenols normally used a 1-electron oxidant, Chapman then followed a precedent involving a 2-electron oxidant and treated desmethylcarpacin with PdCl2 in the presence of sodium acetate (e.g., dissolved in a mixture of methanol and water); the reaction was perceived to proceed via a complexation of a pair of carpacins to the Pd(II) metal via their phenolic anions (as shown in scheme, below right), followed by a classic 8-8' (Œ≤-Œ≤') oxidative phenolic coupling of the two olefin tails‚Äîshown crossing in the image‚Äîto give a dimeric trans-ortho-quinone methide-type of lignan intermediate. A particular conformation of this dimer then places a 4-electron enone of one ring over the 2-electron enol of the other (shown adjacent in image for clarity), setting the state for a variant of the Diels-Alder reaction termed an inverse demand Diels-Alder reaction (see curved arrows in image), which closes the 2 new rings and generates the 5 contiguous stereocenters. The carpanone is produced in yields of ‚âà50% by the original method, and in yields >90% in modern variants (see below). The synthesis of a single diastereomer was confirmed in the original Chapman work, using X-ray crystallography. Biomimetic transformation of desmethylcarpacin into carpanone in one pot, via a tandem oxidative coupling‚ÄìDiels Alder reaction sequence. Note, in the second image in the scheme, the two lines crossing at the top are the two molecules overlapping each other (and do not imply chemical bonds). In this scheme, Pd (II) is shown forming a complex between two monomers of carpacin, then mediating oxidative 8-8' (Œ≤-Œ≤') phenolic coupling of their alkene tails to generate a dimer, a trans-ortho-quinone methide intermediate, followed immediately by an endo-selective inverse electron-demand hetero- Diels-Alder reaction (see Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction#Reaction mechanism), to close the rings and generates the stereocenters. For the elegance of its \\"one-pot construction of a tetracyclic scaffold with complete stereocontrol of five contiguous stereo centers\\", the original Chapman design and synthesis is \\"[n]ow considered a classic in total synthesis\\" that \\"highlights the power of biomimetic synthesis\\".  Extensions of the system  The Chapman approach has been applied in a variety of ways since its original report, varying substrates, oxidants,Per Lindsley et al., see following, oxidant systems, generally including dioxygen, adventitious or otherwise, include azobisisobutyronitrile, Ag2O, M(II) salen systems (M=Co, Mn, Fe), singlet oxygen (hŒΩ, Rose Bengal), dibenzoyl peroxide, and IPh(OAC)2. and other aspects (and so synthesis of carpanone has subsequently been achieved by \\"quite a few research groups\\"); the actual mechanism of Pd(II) action is likely more complex than the original conjecture, and there is evidence that the mechanism, broadly speaking, depends on actual conditions (specific substrate, oxidant, etc.). Various groups, including the laboratories of Steve Ley, Craig Lindley, and Matthew Shair, have succeeded in extending the Chapman method to solid-supported synthesis, i.e., phenolic starting materials on polymeric supports, thus allowing the generation of libraries of carpanone analogs. A hetero-8-8' oxidative coupling system akin to the Chapman approach has been developed that uses IPh(OAC)2, and that allows for preparation of more electron rich homodimers, and for hetero-tetracyclic analogs of carpanone.C.W.

The original hall was a timber-framed moated manor house circa 1470 but it was largely demolished by Sir John Cutte (d. 1520) who built the present house between 1510 and 1515. Sir John Cutte was under-treasurer in the households of Henry VII and Henry VIII. The mansion was built in brick in two storeys in a quadrilateral layout with a gatehouse and incorporated some elements of the former building. The house was visited by Elizabeth I both as a princess and twice as Queen (1571 and 1578) as the guest of Sir John Cutte (1545-1615). It is believed that the Tower was built for her to watch the local hunt. It was while staying at Horham in 1578 that the Queen received the envoy of the Duke of Alen√ßon proposing marriage. She responded by inviting her to court her in person. During her 1571 visit, the court was agitated by the discovery of a plot to place Mary, Queen of Scots on the throne. At its height, Horham Hall was a much larger building than the present structure. Parts of the complex, including the chapel, were demolished in succeeding centuries, but the remaining building was restored in 1840‚Äì50. The estate was sold by Sir John Cutte (c.1581-1646) in 1609 to Andrew Huddleston, who rapidly sold it to John Wiseman. In 1617, it passed to Sir William Smith, nephew and heir of the learned scholar and statesman, Sir Thomas Smith of Hill Hall, Theydon Mount, who was born in Saffron Walden. Horham remained in the possession of the Smith family until the death of the Reverend Sir Edward Bowyer-Smith, 10th Baronet, in 1850. The Smiths were seldom resident, and Charles Buckler (architect) wrote in 1843: \\"The mansion has been uninhabited for about 40 years but it is kept in good repair. The walls, roof, parapet and chimneys are quite entire and not one of the rooms, tho‚Äô all are unfurnished, is made ye resceptical of rubbish, even dust is denied a resting place.\\" The house was sold to Francis George West Esq in 1854. His son, Reverend George West, is commemorated by a tall cross in Thaxted churchyard. In 1905, the house was again sold to Alfred Paget Humphrey, a barrister and famous rifle sharpshooter. His daughter married the then vicar of Thaxted, Revd. Leonard Sedgwick Westall, in 1909. Humphrey's widow lived in the house until the war. During the Second World War, the house was used as a Barnardo‚Äôs evacuation centre for girls and young children. After the war, the house was acquired by Arctic explorer and war hero, Sir George Binney DSO, (1900‚Äì 72). In 1968 the estate land, which consisted of several farms, was sold off and the hall itself purchased by Michael Ward-Thomas and his wife, the novelist Evelyn Anthony. Ward-Thomas sold the house in 1976, due to the excessive maintenance costs. Very extensive major work and entirely contemporary repairs on the house and facilities were carried out by Mr Sandy Shand prior to the Ward- Thomas family returning to Horham Hall in 1982. Evelyn Anthony remained at the Hall until her death in 2018. The Hall is a Grade I listed building. Features 300px All of the typical features of a hall house are still present: a screens passage, above the porch in the plan; a dais; a buttery and a pantry; a bay window (not essential, but very common).

The red box encloses the former Midland Works asbestos factory. The Armley asbestos disaster is an ongoing health issue originating in Armley, a suburb of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. Described by Dr. Geoffrey Tweedale as a \\"social disaster\\", it involved the contamination with asbestos dust of an area consisting of around 1,000 houses in the Armley Lodge area of the city. The contamination was the result of the activities of a local asbestos factory, part of the Turner & Newall (T&N;) group (often referred to by the name of its founders, J. W. Roberts Ltd.) and occurred between the end of the 19th century and 1959 when the factory eventually closed. At its peak the factory had 250 employees. At least 300 former employees are believed to have died from asbestos-related illnesses, and a number of cancer deaths in the Armley area were traced to the factory in 1988 as a result of an investigation by the Yorkshire Evening Post. The estate was found to have the highest incidence in the country of mesothelioma. As the interval between exposure and diagnosis can be up to 50 years the number of further deaths which may occur due to the factory's emissions or residual dust since its closure cannot be predicted. Background J. W. Roberts Ltd. was founded in Armley in 1874 as a textile producer, primarily working with cotton, hemp and jute. By 1906, its factory on Canal Road, known as the Midland Works, specialised in the manufacture of asbestos insulation mattresses for steam locomotive boilers and is believed to have been one of only two factories in the world at the time which processed blue asbestos. In 1920 it merged with Turner Brothers Asbestos Company Ltd., Newalls Insulation Company Ltd., and the Washington Chemical Company Ltd., to form Turner & Newall Ltd., which in 1925 became a public company. T&N;'s rapid growth has been attributed to a product called \\"Sprayed Limpet Asbestos\\", developed in the Armley works in 1931. This was made by mixing raw asbestos with water and cement, the resulting slurry being spray applied to the surface to be insulated, creating a cheap soundproof and extremely fire resistant coating. Sprayed Limpet Asbestos generated huge profits for T&N; who exported the product to 60 countries where it was applied to a wide range of buildings including schools, churches and theatres and the London Underground. The factory at Armley closed in 1959. Asbestos dust emissions Midland Works emitted vast quantities of asbestos dust, primarily through its ventilation system, which covered the nearby streets and rooftops of surrounding houses. One resident told of how his wife \\"used to wipe the greyish white dust off the window sills of their home at 9.30 am, and that an hour later, if the machines at Roberts were blowing out dust, there would be another layer of dust half an inch thick.\\" It was not uncommon until the factory's closure for children to be seen playing in the dust in the streets and the local school's playground, making 'snowballs' which were thrown in ignorance of the danger they posed. Others used the thick layer of dust in the playground to mark out hopscotch squares. In subsequent legal hearings, residents testified how: \\"If you walked right behind the factory it was like cotton. It was in the cracks in the pavement behind the factory;\\" and: \\"It used to be blue-white. We used to sweep this blue dust up. It was blue fluffy stuff ... I used to get up in the morning and the other side of the street always had a layer of fine dust with footmarks on it from the early morning workers.\\" Of the conditions in the nearby school one said: \\"The dust was always there while I was at school, lying on walls or window ledges if it had been damp. It was like snow fall.\\" Describing the loading bay, to which local children had easy access, one witness recalled: \\"Sometimes sacks were left out overnight. They were hessian sacks and they were full of a sort of fluffy dust. We could jump on the sacks when they were left out... I remember seeing grey-blue coloured dust come out of them. If we jumped hard enough the sacks burst open. After sitting or bouncing on the sacks I remember being covered in dust.\\" During the summer doors and windows of both the factory and the houses were left open for cooling, and during the winter children often congregated around the factory's street-level ventilation outlets for warmth. =Residual contamination= In 1974, after reviewing company documents about Midland Works, a T&N; public relations officer wrote: \\"I hope very much indeed that we are never called upon to discuss Armley in the public arena.\\" In 1978, however, Leeds City Council informed T&N; that the factory was still \\"badly contaminated\\" with asbestos, with dust found in the basement, lift shaft, roof, ventilation shafts and beneath the floors. Hessian sacks containing asbestos fibre were still present, and the yard was filled with 'a few hundred tonnes' of blue asbestos waste mixed with soil. R. D. Lunt, T&N;'s Safety and Environment manager, wrote of the factory basement: \\"Every nook and cranny has asbestos fibre in it\\". T&N; contributed ¬£15,000 towards the clean-up of the factory, and claimed they were doing so out of \\"a moral, not a legal responsibility\\" to do so. The surrounding houses and buildings were not included in this operation, and Leeds City Council and T&N; \\"agreed to keep the whole matter 'low-key' if approached by the media\\", while a T&N; internal memo stated \\"The Principal Inspector of Factories and the Assistant Director of Environmental Health are anxious to play this down and have given us considerable support.\\" Documents discovered by lawyers in the 1990s revealed that in 1979 T&N; were also notified of asbestos contamination in a house in Aviary Road that had once been part of the Midland Works after the city's Public Analyst found asbestos in an attic and garden, and an internal T&N; memo about this stated \\"... presumably it is reasonable to suppose that adjoining properties might also be involved.\\" Leeds City Council did not inform the public. T&N; paid for the decontamination of the property in Aviary Road but \\"secured an understanding that 'any reference to the proximity of the buildings to the old JW Roberts factory will now be omitted from the Land Registry Records'\\" and all such references were then removed by Leeds City Council. They then began to prepare \\"dossiers on 'likely attackers' and journalists with a 'special interest' in asbestos.\\" In 1992, when asked to comment about contamination in Aviary Road T&N; said: \\"T&N; has not been made aware of any evidence linking that asbestos with JW Roberts's former factory.\\" Yorkshire Evening Post investigation During the 1970s the incidence of mesothelioma in former workers at the factory began to rise, but cases were also being found in people who had never worked for T&N;, although they had lived in the vicinity of Midland Works or had relatives who were former employees. In 1987 Richard Taylor, a journalist with the Yorkshire Evening Post, began checking through the coroner's court reports, examining death certificates and interviewing relatives and neighbours of the deceased. As a result, Taylor was able to demonstrate a pattern \\"of an incredibly high incidence of mesothelioma deaths in Armley around the Roberts factory.\\" Philip Sanderson Gill, the coroner, agreed with the findings, and said: \\"It was only as a trend over a number of years that a more precise picture appeared. I have very few other cases from other areas of Leeds. It is significant that virtually all the cases we have come from that area.\\" The Yorkshire Evening Post produced a series of articles about the ongoing contamination and disease, which they dubbed the \\"Armley Asbestos Tragedy\\". =Parliamentary debate= Taylor met with John Battle, then the Member of Parliament for Leeds West, in 1987 to present his findings, and Battle raised the matter in a House of Commons debate. Along with Leeds City Council, he called for a public inquiry into the deaths at Armley, but the incumbent Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher rejected the request, on the grounds that it \\"would cause needless concern, that it was impossible to discover what had happened at Roberts, and that no one could then have imagined that the dust could have harmed residents.\\" Battle submitted to the House: \\"I cannot believe that those who owned and ran Roberts can have gone in and out without seeing the dust everywhere on the surrounding streets and pavements. If they knew that their workers within had to be protected from the asbestos dust, how could they have ignored the position of their neighbours who lived with that dust outside? It was not rendered neutral or innocuous as it left their premises. If they knew, why did they knowingly continue to ask not only their employees but local residents for a generation to pay the price with their lives for the profits of continued asbestos production? ...Should not the company be responsible for that deadly legacy? The Armley asbestos tragedy cannot remain private and hidden because it is not yet over.\\" ='Civic conscience'= Walley (2003) stressed the importance of the role played by the Yorkshire Evening Post and the local MP, John Battle in sustaining interest in the Armley story for several years, from the discovery of the associated deaths, largely the work of Taylor at the Post, up until the case finally reached court. Without downplaying the later efforts of such organisations, Walley believed it noteworthy that the Post was championing the cause \\"significantly before the emergence of any residents organisation\\" and sees their persistence as evidence that \\"behind the front page headlines there was at work a 'civic conscience' committed to the revelation and exposure of something very significant to the city as a whole,\\" rather than a superficial, immediate coverage focusing predominantly on \\"the spectacular effects of eco- disasters.\\" Between 1988 and 1992, he says, \\"the development of the issues of the tragedy seem almost an elite affair between local journalists and the local M.P.\\" and dealt with the \\"reality... which may be intrinsically long term and whose complexity goes considerably beyond the human interest aspects of the spectacular.\\" =Yorkshire Television= On 20 July 1982, Yorkshire Television broadcast the documentary Alice - A Fight For Life, predominantly the story of Alice Jefferson, who had worked at the Acre Mill asbestos factory in Hebden Bridge for just nine months when she was 17 years old. Thirty years later she was diagnosed with mesothelioma and given only six months to live. The documentary was also an \\"expos√© on the workings of the asbestos industry.\\" Its broadcast resulted in ¬£60 million being knocked off T&N;'s share price overnight, headlines in the national newspapers, and the setting up of a government enquiry. Within ten days the government had halved the legal limit for asbestos dust in the workplace. In 1988 Yorkshire Television picked up the Yorkshire Evening Post story and produced a second critical investigation focusing on the pattern of deaths in Armley, and contradicting the government's reasons for refusing an inquiry. Called Too Close to Home, it was broadcast as part of the First Tuesday documentary series on 6 December 1988. City Council responses Leeds City Council commissioned a report into the deaths from the Department of Public Health at the University of Leeds. The council also began a survey of some of the houses in the neighbourhood, looking for residual contamination. Asbestos dust was found to be present in the roofing, cellars and window sashes. As a result, a warning letter was sent to all residents informing them of the possibility of asbestos contamination in their homes and the need for specialised decontamination. When asked, the Minister for Housing and Planning, Sir George Young, responded that the government would not provide financial assistance to the home owners or the council to pay for decontamination, as this \\"would not be a justifiable use of public funds.\\" In further tests between 1998 - 2001 the council surveyed 364 houses adjacent to Midland Works. Residual asbestos contamination was found in 363 of the properties tested. As of November 2008, a further 610 properties had been tested and found to contain residual asbestos dust, and decontaminated at a cost of ¬£9.3 million. T&N; response T&N;'s chairman Sir Colin Hope, writing on 25 October 1989, claimed that after the company vacated and sold the premises in 1959, it had ceased to keep any records relating to the operation, that it held no archived records, and what records might still exist would be \\"extremely scanty\\" (sic) and \\"largely confined to basic employee record cards.\\" John Battle MP addressed the House of Commons on 8 July 1992 regarding the difficulties faced in mounting a legal case against T&N;: \\"Basically, it is an attempt legally to prove negligence in the face of foreseeable likelihood that harm would occur as a result of causing or permitting asbestos dust to permeate the atmosphere in or around the factory premises in Canal Road, Armley, between 1925 and 1958... The legal test is whether the company knew that the dust could cause serious or possibly fatal injury to those living in the 840 houses nearby who work in the local workplaces or who attend the Armley Clock school... I have reason to believe that the company and other sources, medical and environmental, did have that sort of data, and still do. The difficulty lies in seeking it out - discovering it - and, especially, forcing the company to disclose all that it knew and knows.\\" =Obstruction= T&N; allegedly sought wherever possible to delay proceedings, including slowing and obstructing the process of disclosure of documents, by claiming that \\"within the interlocking structure of companies T&N; could not be construed as liable for its subsidiary‚Äôs actions\\" and by conduct, as the judge later ruled, \\"reflecting a wish to contest these claims by any means possible, legitimate or otherwise... simply to obstruct the plaintiff‚Äôs road.\\" In parallel with the delaying tactics, T&N; pursued \\"a resilient re-affirmation of the safety of asbestos products and manufacturing processes\\" in the press, spending ¬£500,000 on PR in just six weeks. In a speech to the Commons on 21 February 1994 John Battle outlined the extent of the delays with disclosure, describing how an order for certain documents to be disclosed had been made by the judge in September 1992, to which T&N; applied for permission to appeal in March 1993. The appeal was heard on 9 December 1993 at which point T&N; decided to drop their appeal. Then on 8 February 1994 they applied for their time for the compliance to be extended until 1 May 1994, followed by a claim that, \\"as they are to put all their records on computer and are to use an American company to do it, it would be too difficult for them to comply with that order. They said that the preliminary search work and drawing up of computer specifications cannot be completed until the beginning of July [1994] and that the real process of making the documentation available may not happen until 1995.\\" =Disowning Midland Works= In 1993, Sir Colin Hope stated: \\"...[T]he factory in question was not owned or operated by this Company. It was owned and operated by a company known as J.W. Roberts Limited (\\"JWR\\"). JWR ceased production at that factory in 1958/59, and vacated and sold the premises shortly thereafter. Although JWR continued in business for some time after leaving the Armley site, the company ceased to trade over twenty years ago... I am aware of the various comments and allegations that have been made about JWR's Armley factory, particularly as the source of the contamination to which you refer. Those comments and allegations are not accepted.\\" In the Commons, John Battle responded that he was in possession of correspondence \\"in which the same T&N; plc sought to convince Her Majesty's Inspector of Taxes that, for tax purposes, J.W. Roberts of Armley was still in business as an integral part of T&N; and should be taken into account when calculating tax reductions. Is it too cynical to suggest that JWR is counted in only for profits, but discounted when it comes to its responsibility for local lives?\\" Chase Manhattan Bank v T&N; In 1987 Chase Manhattan Bank (Chase) began legal proceedings against T&N; in the United States. Chase claimed compensatory and punitive damages from T&N; for the hazard created at Chase's corporate headquarters by the presence of spray applicated asbestos fireproofing materials. In the United Kingdom, John Battle had complained to Parliament that securing documents from T&N; was causing progress with the Armley victims' cases to stall, with \\"documents shifted around from one subsidiary to another within the parent group. Lawyers are expected to specify exactly what records they want without knowing what the company holds. Even if they manage to specify particular records, such as reports on the escape of dust from the factory and tested measurements of asbestos levels within the factory or in the surrounding area - even details of the factory's structure and its ventilation system - those documents are either outwith the rules of discovery or the reply comes back that the records no longer exist.\\" But as the Chase case progressed, around two million T&N; documents, many of which had previously been unseen by British solicitors and historians, were uncovered by the discovery process and research in the US. =Michael O'Connor= The bank's Vice President Michael O'Connor, himself a senior lawyer, recognised the value of the documents, which dated back as far as the 1920s, and, as no protective order had been placed on them which would have prevented their disclosure to third parties, \\"began sending large bundles of key T&N; documents to the media, lawyers, doctors, victims' support groups and historians.\\" As well as forming the basis for two BBC documentaries, \\"Deadly Legacy\\" (broadcast 14 April 1993) and \\"An Acceptable Level of Death\\" (14 April 1994) and two BBC Radio 4 programmes, \\"The Shocking Story of Asbestos\\" (6 October 1993) and \\"Asbestos and the Third World\\" (13 October 1993), the documents provided crucial information to lawyers in the U.K. who had previously been told that such information was no longer kept, and also revealed how early the company had known about the real risks of asbestos. Other documents included a 1964 T&N; memorandum describing the growing public awareness that asbestos caused cancer as a \\"sinister development\\" and a document about new safety regulations which said: \\"If, however, we demonstrate by a token effort only an ostensible intention to comply with the regulations, it is conceivable that we can ward off the evil day when asbestos cannot be economically applied.\\" In 1995 O'Connor was awarded the Freedom of Information Award in the UK, presented by Tony Blair, in recognition of \\"his remarkable efforts to supply British victims of asbestos diseases with documents needed for their compensation claims.\\" Margereson v J. W. Roberts Ltd. and Hancock v J. W. Roberts Ltd. Arthur Margereson was born in 1925 and lived approximately 200 yards away from Midland Works. Although he never worked at the factory, he lived all of his life in the same property in Armley except during his wartime military service, commencing in 1943, returning to the house after his service had ended. In September 1990 he was diagnosed with mesothelioma. Although legal action was commenced in 1990, Margereson died from his cancer in 1991, and the case subsequently involved his widow, Evelyn, under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 and on behalf of her husband's estate under the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934. The case suffered many delays and setbacks, particularly due to the obstructive actions of the defendants, who for two years had resisted access to internal company documents which demonstrated they were aware of the risk in 1933, and was still unresolved by the time it was combined with the case of a second victim of environmental exposure, June Hancock, in 1994. Although separate cases, they were heard as one. A third plaintiff, David Young, died of his cancer in December 1993, but had no surviving family to continue his action against the company. A further 12 victims who were previously seeking compensation from T&N; had also died before their cases reached court. June Hancock had also grown up next to the Midland Works, and had never worked inside the factory. Her mother died of mesothelioma in 1982, and June was diagnosed with the cancer herself in 1993. Hancock instructed a solicitor shortly after she was diagnosed and the writ was issued on 5 September 1994. The two cases were heard over six weeks at Leeds High Court in 1995. Despite being in the terminal stage of her illness, Hancock attended court on all but one day of the hearing. T&N; had conceded before the trial that Hancock's and Margereson's illnesses were caused by asbestos from the factory, but any compensation depended on proving that the company knew or should have known the dangers the dust could cause. Three months after the hearing ended Mr. Justice Holland handed down a written judgment, finding for the plaintiffs, and awarded damages of ¬£65,000 to June Hancock and ¬£50,000 to Evelyn Margereson. The judge ruled that the defendant was liable on the grounds that the risks of asbestos dust exposure had been known by the defendant since 1933 and it was foreseeable that children allowed to play in the vicinity of the factory would be exposed to the risk of pulmonary disease. This was a landmark decision, extending as it did the duty of care beyond factory employees to those outside a factory's walls. The judge said of the emissions from Midland Works: \\"there is no doubt but that every process in varying degree gave off dust ... There was at all material times, a substantial emission of dust from the factory premises\\", and that \\"There was knowledge, sufficient to found reasonable foresight on the part of the Defendants, that children were particularly vulnerable to personal injury arising out of inhalation of asbestos dust ... Reasonably practicable steps were not taken to reduce or prevent inhalation of emitted asbestos dust.\\" Regarding the conduct of the case, Mr Justice Holland accused T&N; of trying to obstruct the legal action and to wear Hancock and Margereson down \\"by attrition\\". He said they had shown \\"a wish to contest these claims by any means possible, legitimate or otherwise\\" and that their lawyers had \\"remorselessly persisted in taking bad points, apparently simply to obstruct the plaintiffs' road.\\" In a press statement, T&N; repeated their claim that they could not have known \\"so many years ago of the risks to individuals such as these plaintiffs\\" and said they believed \\"the judge was wrong to find T&N; liable in these cases. The factory closed almost 40 years ago.\\" Hancock said after the ruling: \\"The money won't do me much good, but there's no other way they can pay. The only way they can answer for what they did is money.\\" She died on 19 July 1997. A charity, the June Hancock Mesothelioma Research Fund, was established shortly after her death to support victims of mesothelioma and mesothelioma research projects. =Appeal= T&N; applied for leave to appeal in December 1995, and submissions were heard in March 1996 by Lord Justices Russell, Saville and Otton. William Woodward QC, for T&N;, submitted that it could never be known when and where a person developed mesothelioma and it could not be determined which particular dust particle produced mesothelioma. On these grounds, T&N; should not be held responsible for cancer which could have arisen from asbestos dust produced by another company. Lord Justice Russell responded that the line that had to be drawn was where, outside the factory walls, the risk of personal injury became less than a real possibility and said \\"It is not a very attractive argument for the factory owner to agree that mountains of asbestos dust were created but these cases of cancer were not the result of that.\\" The appeal was dismissed on 2 April 1996, and permission to appeal to the House of Lords was refused. Lord Justice Russell rejected T&N;'s claim that they could not have known of the dangers before 1933 and said: \\"The true date was much earlier, certainly long before Mr Margereson's birth date [1925]. His activities as a child, therefore, as well as Mrs Hancock's, were at a time when the defendants were on actual or constructive notice as to the potential pulmonary damage that exposure to asbestos dust could bring about.\\" As a result of the ruling, T&N; accepted liability with a further 60 claimants from Armley. The full amount of compensation was never paid out as T&N; eventually filed for bankruptcy. There were still hundreds of outstanding cases relating to dust emitted from Midland Works, but plaintiffs' solicitors were informed that as a result of the bankruptcy, all legal actions against T&N; and its subsidiaries would be stayed. Federal-Mogul In 1998, with 263,000 claims for injury pending, T&N; was bought by Federal-Mogul, a multinational auto-parts conglomerate based in Southfield, Michigan, USA. On 1 October 2001, after lobbying efforts for a bailout failed, Federal-Mogul filed for Chapter 11 protection to shield the company from asbestos litigation. This allowed them to \\"ringfence\\" their assets and continue trading while not having to meet the asbestos-related claims. At the time, the company's turnover was approximately $6 billion, and its UK group of companies had a turnover of approximately ¬£400 million. Compensation cheques to victims who had won their claims were dishonoured, outstanding court cases placed on hold and an embargo put in place preventing new actions from being launched. Federal-Mogul's chairman Frank Macher, claimed that despite the insolvency: \\"Federal-Mogul will continue to serve its existing customers, fulfill current contracts and secure new business... Federal-Mogul is continuing business operations without interruption and with the full support of our major customers.\\" Speaking in the Commons, John Battle MP alleged: \\"The resort to administration looks like a rearguard action of complex corporate gamesmanship to avoid responsibility for paying out legitimate court-won compensation awards.\\" =Lack of valid insurance= In the UK, questions were raised over whether T&N; had any valid insurance in place. Those insurance companies which could be connected to T&N;, such as Royal & Sun Alliance, alleged that their policies excluded liability for asbestos-related claims, although this was in breach of the Employers' Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969. Insurers stated that instead they had an \\"understanding\\" that T&N; itself would settle asbestos claims and, \\"in return for premiums received, the insurers would, however, issue a Certificate of Insurance which complied with the terms of the Employers' Liability Act, thereby enabling T&N; to continue trading.\\" By 2003, no payments had been received by UK claimants and a request to the government to set up an interim compensation scheme was rejected, as was a request to the US Creditors' Committee of Federal-Mogul to make hardship payments to UK victims. As further litigation ensued to test the validity of the insurers' exclusions, public demonstrations were held outside the Manchester offices of Kroll Corporate Advisory & Restructuring Group, the court-appointed Administrators for T&N.; Tony Whitston, spokesperson for North-West Asbestos Victims‚Äô Support Groups, said: \\"Kroll have charged ¬£17 million in fees to date and their solicitors have charged ¬£6 million. The charge out rate for a senior partner at Kroll is ¬£460 per hour. The financial ‚Äúkilling‚Äù being made by the Administrators is reducing the resources [¬£70 million] left to pay dying victims. We think this behaviour is a classic example of corporate greed and callousness.\\" =Payment= In November 2004, law firms representing 50 successful claimants from Armley secured payment of 24 pence in the pound for their clients. June Hancock's solicitor Adrian Budgen explained that victims were \\"typically\\" awarded compensation of ¬£100,000, of which ¬£10,000 was invariably paid back to cover any industrial injury benefits received. The victim would then receive only 24% of the remaining ¬£90,000. He said: \\"It is a pittance. If we had known in 2001 it was going to take four years I am sure there would have been a much bigger outcry. We just ran into the mire. It was beyond our control. Very much of what was happening was being dictated across the water in the United States.\\" All of the 50 claimants had already died by the time the payments were made. Further claims of compensation for other victims eventually commenced in 2007 when Federal-Mogul emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. By that time, just ¬£91 million was available for T&N;'s worldwide non-U.S. asbestos liabilities for the next 40 years. Successful applicants receive as little as 17% of the value of their claims. =Post-2007= Rachel Reeves, elected as MP for Leeds West in May 2010, raised the issue of justice for the victims of the asbestos disaster and their families in a series of questions in Parliament. In her maiden speech she said: \\"There is a real concern that the coalition will use the country's financial deficit as an excuse to unfairly target working people, particularly those who have been left dealing with the devastating effects of exposure to asbestos. With the backing of trade unions and support groups a huge amount of effort has gone into making sure that the voices of asbestos victims and their families are heard by Government and as a result a number of important assurances were made to them at the end of the last Parliament. It's vital those commitments are not reneged upon to the detriment of thousands of asbestos victims across the country.\\" Dust June Hancock's story formed the subject of a play, Dust, by Kenneth F. Yates, which was performed in Armley and at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in July 2009.

His paternal great-grandmother, Racheal Williams, was born 1810 in Virginia and was commonly referred to as a mulatto. She may have had a white mother or father (more likely a white father, as would have been more typical of the period). Peg Leg Sam taught himself to play harmonica as a small child. He left home at the age of 12 and never stopped roving. He shined shoes, worked as a houseboy, cooked on ships, hoboed, and then made a living busking on street corners.

He joined the medicine show circuit in 1937, often performing with Pink Anderson. His ability to play two harmonicas at once (while one went in and out of his mouth) made him an attraction; he could also play notes on a harmonica with his nose. Peg Leg Sam married Theo S. Jackson, who was 18 years his senior and the mother of Herbert Miller and Katherine Miller, both natives of Tennessee. Peg Leg Sam gave his last medicine-show performance in 1972 in North Carolina but continued to appear at music festivals in his final years.

Several Roman writers give accounts of Surus, which was probably a large Syrian elephant with one tusk. Although a Carthaginian coin struck in the time of Hannibal depicts a North African elephant, historians believe Surus was an Western Asiatic or Syrian elephant descended from those seized by the Ptolemies of Egypt in the Syrian Wars. According to some accounts, the animal was the last of the 37 war elephants Hannibal took with him on his 218 B.C. crossing of the Alps, during the Second Punic War. According to Plautus, Surus wore a red cloth, and may also have carried a red shield and a howdah (a construction on the animal's back), which served as a platform for Hannibal, who had difficulties overlooking the battlefield after losing one eye from an infection.

The Act stipulated explicitly that a \\"good reason\\" could include sporting or competition purposes, or shooting vermin. Section 5 prohibited the sale of shotgun ammunition except to someone entitled under the Act to possess a shotgun, or someone acting on their behalf.s. 5 The Act made it an offence to modify a shotgun to have a barrel less than 24 inches in length,s. 6 (1) and stipulated that a prohibited weapon which had been converted into another type of weapon remained prohibited with the exception of the fitting of a barrel longer than 24 inches to a pump action or semi- automatic shotgun that had previously had a shorter barrel fitted.s. 7 However, a prohibited firearm could be \\"deactivated\\" and thus no longer fall under the scope of the Act.s. 8 Sections 9 through 12 governed the issuing of firearm certificates, whilst section 13 modified the regulations involving firearms dealers and section 14 required people transporting or storing firearms to store them securelys. 14 (1) (a) and report any loss to the police.s. 14 (1) (b) There were a number of specified exemptions to the requirement for a licence; members of approved rifle or pistol clubs were allowed to carry and use firearms when target shooting even if they did not themselves hold a licence,s. 15 (1) and someone over the age of seventeen was allowed to borrow a legally held firearm from its owner and use it, under supervision of the owner and complying with the owner's licence, on private premises.s. 16 (1) Foreign visitors could hold a \\"visitor's permit\\", which allowed them to possess any legal firearm without a licence;s. 17 (1) this licence would be granted by the local police.s. 17 (2) It was also possible to purchase a firearm without a licence if it was intended to be promptly exported.s. 18. The purchaser had to have been in Britain for less than thirty days in the previous year, and the firearm would have to be exported without first coming into their physical possession Finally, firearms in museums were exempted from certain provisions.s. 19, and the Schedule Amendments *Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997: introduced in response to the Dunblane school massacre and the recommendations of the Cullen Report that followed it.

Originally, Caswell Massey started as an apothecary shop in Newport, Rhode Island, by a Scottish-born doctor named William Hunter.‚ÄúCaswell-Massey Timetable‚Äù, by Wermuth/Reed Associates; part of company archives. The main product categories include fine-fragrance, soap, bath & body products, men's shaving products and toiletries, other assorted apothecary-style personal care accessories. Its products are preferred favorites of notable historical figures such as: JFK, George Washington, Cole Porter, Alla Nazimova, John Denver, and The Rolling Stones. The company is regarded as the fourth-oldest continuously operating company in America and the oldest American consumer brand in operation. The current motto of is \\"America's Original\\". 1752-1755 Dr. William Hunter established Dr. Hunters Dispensary in Newport in 1752. Caswell Massey began as an apothecary shop selling medical supplies. Hunter gave the first lectures on anatomy and surgery in the Colonies in 1755. During that time, he also invented orange soda to help his customers take the medicines sold in his apothecary shop. 1789-1800 Newport, Rhode Island, at the time, was a destination for the social elite to buy European-style luxuries. While selling medical products, Dr. Hunter also began selling cosmetic, personal care, and hygiene products and developed a business in medicinal essential oils, such as lavender and verbena. He also imported fragrances from Europe, and blended 20 of his own different colognes, numbered One through Twenty; Dr. Hunter's Cologne Number Six was often purchased by George Washington and was given as a gift by the President to the Marquis de Lafayette, and thereby became very popular among many politicians and intellectuals in early American society after Independence. During the same time, White Rose perfume was introduced for women, and became a favorite of Dolley Madison, who was rumored to bathe in the perfume. The shop was also known for its very high-quality Castile soap, which was purchased by Lewis and Clark for their Western expedition. 1800-1840 For approximately the first three-quarters of a century the apothecary shop changed owners in the traditional way; each retiring pharmacist handing over the keys to his apprentice. Dr. William Hunter was followed by his son, also William Hunter; then followed by Charles Feke, who in turn was followed by Rowland Hazard in 1822. Hazard took Philip Caswell into partnership and the name became Hazard & Caswell. In 1833 following Rowland Hazard‚Äôs death the company became Caswell & Hazard. In the same year, the first Caswell-Hazard branch opened in New York City. 1840-1906 A fragrance called Jockey Club was introduced in 1840. The company during that time also continued to expand its line to include other apothecary products including cucumber night cream, oatmeal soaps, goats milk soaps, and other items. In the 1850s, Hazard formed a partnership with Phillip Caswell, and later in 1867, was joined by both John R. Caswell (Phillips Brother) and J. Hazard (Rowland's Brother or son?). Phillip Caswell resigned from the partnership in 1872, and sold his shares to Rowland Hazard; John Caswell set up shops and continued the business in parallel to the Hazard business during this time, and a lawsuit was undertaken in 1876 over the rights to be the successor of both the 'Caswell' name and the 'Established 1780 AD' trademark, as well as the books of formulations, Caswell was triumphant in the suit, proving in the court records that in fact, they had sold the physical shops and the shop fixtures and stock in labels, but not the rights to the name or the formulations. It is unclear, but it appears that the Hazards were given the exclusive right to claim the 'Established 1780 AD' mark; but in fact, Caswell also succeeded on this point, as it was later established that the business was in fact established by Dr. Hunter in 1752 and not by Feke in 1780 - that had merely been the aforementioned ruse that was used to prevent the firm from being confiscated under disloyalty to the new American government. The company took its present name, Caswell-Massey, when then-owner John Rose Caswell formed a partnership with New York businessman William Massey in 1876. With rightful ownership of the original formulations of Dr. Hunter and a new partnership with William Massey, a Canadian doctor, the firm rightly claimed the 'Established 1752' trademark and provenance for their brand. In that year the company operated two stores, one in Newport and one in New York City. John R. Caswell and William Massey continued to operate in New York City and Newport, RI, until 1906 when the business was incorporated as the Caswell- Massey Company under the guidance of George C. Lyon and John C. Knight of the Hall & Lyon Company of Providence, Rhode Island; the business continued to grow to ten stores, but was reduced to two stores by 1915. 1906-1936 During the early to mid-1900s, the apothecary business expanded its service to provide 'custom' perfumes and fragrances as private stock for its most notable customers. Customers who used this service were interviewed on their tastes in food, music, and lifestyle, and given five fragrances to try. After a period of time, their favorite fragrance was selected and five variants of that fragrance were created. After a final period of wearing these, the customer's signature fragrance was refined and bottled and could be ordered on demand. This was an expensive service at the time, costing customers up to $200 per ounce. Customers to the Caswell-Massey stores during this time included many notable New Yorkers, as well as Broadway stars such as Alla Nazimova, and New York elite such as the Astors and Vanderbilts;Caswell-Massey products can be found on display in the Vanderbilt Mansion in Hyde Park, New York George Gershwin, Judy Garland, Katharine Hepburn and Greta Garbo.‚ÄúThe Amazing World of Caswell-Massey‚Äù, Cosmopolitan Magazine, 1977 In 1926 a store was opened on Lexington (the 48th in New York City), in what was then the Barclay Hotel, later InterContinental New York Barclay Hotel. ( It remained the company‚Äôs flagship store until 2010 when the Barclay's Hotel was closed for renovations). In 1936, Ralph Taylor and his younger brother Milton Taylor bought the company. Ralph had been working for Caswell-Massey for twenty years since 1916 when a 13-year-old Ralph Taylor was hired to sweep the shop and clean bottles in the basement. Unlike the previous owners, the Taylors retained the name Caswell-Massey, which had acquired a worldwide reputation during the 60 years under Caswell as one of the most important fragrances and soap brands in the world. 1940-1953 In 1941, Caswell-Massey introduced Tricorn cologne and expanded its notoriety among the New York elite. The company's cold cream was a popular product for many Broadway stars, and luminaries such as Cole Porter who wore the new Tricorn cologne. 1960-1988 During the second half of the century, clients included United States President John F. Kennedy, who wore Caswell Massey's Jockey Club cologne; his wife, Jacqueline Onassis (who bought avocado oil), and pop culture figures who shopped from the company's famously hand-illustrated direct mail catalog and who frequented the company's Lexington Avenue Store. Patrons at the Lexington & 48th street store included Debbie Harry, Joni Mitchell, John Denver, and the Rolling Stones. In the 1980s, the company expanded across the United States and added several overseas stores. Caswell-Massey was managed by the Taylor family from 1936‚Äì1989. Milton's older son Adam joined the company in 1974 and soon rose to be president, and younger son Joshua joined in 1979. When they started working at Caswell-Massey, the company had only one store. However, the new younger Taylor blood injected fresh energy into the enterprise, and over the next ten years they added 20 more retail stores and about a dozen franchise stores, spread throughout the US and Canada. Also during that time frame, Josh oversaw and overhauled the extensive product lines and assortments offered by the company, and introduced or re packaged 600 Caswell-Massey branded products, and together with the retail store expansion the company grew ten times in sales. Josh created and introduced Greenbriar cologne in 1984. 1988-2007 The Taylors sold the company to private owners in 1988; at the time, the company had over 28 stores in the US; the company continued with modest growth under new owners for several years before taking a downturn due to rising competition from mall competitors such as Crabtree & Evelyn (founded in 1972) and Bath & Body Works (founded in 1990) which offered similar products, albeit with less history. In 1999, after struggling for several years, Anne Robinson lead a buyout of the company. Under Anne Robinson's leadership, the company experienced a brief turnaround and celebrated its 250th anniversary in 2002. Modest growth and international business continued for the company. Anne Robinson departed the company in 2003. After trading hands between various investors, the company was purchased by its current ownership in 2007. Re-branding & re-launch As of 2017, the company remains privately owned and operated in America, headquartered in Edison, New Jersey, and New York City. The company re-branded in 2017 which included the launch of a new website and new catalog. Updated formulas of their \\"Heritage\\" men‚Äôs colognes and their \\"Centuries\\" collection have been re-released. Caswell also re-launched its essential oil business in collaboration with MKG Bio Alchemy, and is planning 2018 releases of new men's and women's fragrances in collaboration with the world-renowned New York Botanical Gardens and the International Flavors and Fragrances, Inc. Caswell Massey plans to re-release some of its private stock fragrances, such as \\"Marem\\": a fragrance originally created for silent film star Alla Nazimova in 1914, and \\"Supernatural Number 6\\": the fragrance favorite of George Washington. Caswell Massey continues to formulate and produce original, unique products that maintains a loyal client base. All of its fragrance and personal care items are still made in America, many using the original formulations. center References * ‚ÄúCaswell-Massey Timetable‚Äù, by Wermuth/Reed Associates; part of company archives. * ‚ÄúThe Amazing World of Caswell-Massey‚Äù, Cosmopolitan Magazine, 1977  External links  *Website Notes Category:Companies established in 1752 Category:Companies based in New Jersey Category:Personal care brands Category:Fragrance companies Category:Soap brands Category:Personal care companies Category:Cosmetics companies of the United States Category:American brands ","title":"Caswell-Massey"},{"id":"22793143","text":"Buddhism in Finland represents a very small percentage of that nation's religious practices.

The site contains important information for archaeologists on how early humans adapted to a constantly changing environment. Gobero is located in the T√©n√©r√© desert of Niger, and is named after the Tuareg name for the region. It is the type site of the Holocene era Kiffian culture and Tenerian culture. Site The area was once the location of a freshwater paleolake named Gobero, approximately 3 km in diameter and, 3 m in depth. There are eight sites that make up Gobero: G1, G2, G3, G4, G5, G6, G7, and G8, five of which (G1, G2, G3, G5, and G8) have funerary and habitation remains. Site G1 is a dune that rises from the lake basin to an elevation of 56.035m above sea level and extends east-west. It contains 19 excavated burials, 20 individuals in total. Site G2 is a hill between Site G1 and 3 that contained four burials. G3 is 300 meters Northwest of G1 and contained 48 burials with 51 individuals total. Site G8 is 6.5 km West of G3 and contained some human burials as well as lithic artifacts and pottery. The time frame of the site has been divided into four phases: Phase I dates from around 14,000-7700 BCE and is characterized by weakening monsoons and the aridification of the area, which created the earliest paleodunes at the site, Phase II dates from 7700-6200 BCE and is characterized by a wet climate and the first evidence of occupation by a fisher-gatherer group known as the Kiffians. The next phase is an interruption in the occupation of the site from 6200 BCE ‚Äì 5200 BCE due to the return of dry and arid conditions making the site uninhabitable. Phase III dates from 5200 BCE to 2200 BCE, and is characterized by the second main occupation of the site at Gobero by a group known as the Tenerians. The final Phase, Phase IV, dates from 2500 BCE to 300 BCE and is the period in which the Sahara dries out once more, ending any occupation. A wealth of lithic artifacts were recovered from sites G1 and G3, though most came from the surface. A total of 4,685 artifacts came from G1 and 11,503 came from G3. These included cores, blanks, endscrapers, perforators, burins, backed tools, notches, denticulates, truncations, geometric tools, sidescrapers, arrowheads, tenerian disks, bifacial tools, axes and adzes, grinding stones and polished axes and other retouched tools. 4,646 potsherds were collected during excavations in 2005-6, all from G1 and G3. Vessel shapes were open and closed bowls and jars. Types of decorative techniques for the pots included rocker stamping, mainly found at site G1, decorations with cord-wrapped tools, and decorations made with combs. Some decoration styles included plain zigzags, straight zigzags, curved zigzags, zigzags that form fishnet patterns, and dotted zigzags. Excavations Aerial view of Gobero archaeological siteThe site was discovered in 2000 by a team led by University of Chicago paleontologist and geologist Paul Sereno, whose previous expeditions to the region had uncovered numerous fossils, including those of the formerly unknown dinosaur Nigersaurus and the crocodylomorph Sarcosuchus. Discovered by team photographer Mike Hettwer on October 13, 2000, the sheer size and scope of the find, including traces of pottery, human remains and quantities of aquatic-environment animal bones, suggested the site dated to the early- to mid-Holocene, or \\"Green Sahara\\" period (7500‚Äì3500 BCE). In 2005, Sereno organized an international team of archaeologists to explore the site. These archaeologists discovered that Gobero had been almost continually inhabited for 5000 years, beginning roughly from 8000 BCE onwards when the area fronted a large lake. The 2007 and 2008 expeditions had to be canceled due to hostilities between Nigerien government forces and Tuareg tribesmen. The first comprehensive report on Gobero was published by Sereno in August 2008, and he returned again to the region in 2011. Human occupationKiffian culture= Evidence of human occupation at Gobero started during the Early Holocene dating around 7550 BCE to 6250 BCE (9500 to 8200 BP). The Early Holocene occupation is associated with the Kiffian culture: they were tall (as much as 6-foot 8-inches). According to Sereno (2008), \\"Their crania were long and low and are characterized by a distinct occipital bun, flattened sagittal profile, pentagonal posterior outline, broad proportions across the zygoma and interorbital region, broad nasal aperture, and negligible alveolar prognathism.\\" They were heavily muscled hunter-fishers, they left a distinctive pottery with wavy lines and probably remained in the region until around 6000 BCE. A radiogenic strontium isotopic analysis done on the burials at the G3 area of the site show limited variability in the mobility of the group: people stayed and lived in the area for most of their lives, and it was only towards the end of this occupation that evidence indicating possible mobility started appearing. Artifacts associated with this occupation at the Gobero site include microliths, bone harpoons and hooks, dotted wavy-line pottery, and zigzag impressed motifs. =Tenerian culture= The Middle Holocene occupation is associated with the T√©n√©rians, who settled the area 1000 or more years after the Kiffians, 6250 BCE to 2550 BCE (8200 to 4500 BP). According to Sereno, \\"Their crania are long, high and narrow, and their faces are taller with considerable alveolar prognathism.\\" This was a nomadic herding culture. Artifacts found in association include bones and tusks from fauna, projectile points, ceramics, ivory, bone and shell ornaments. There are also middens with remains of catfish, tilapia, hippos, antelope, soft shell turtles, crocodile, and domesticated cattle. Burials At least 182 burial sites were found at Gobero. Of these, 67 have been excavated, and some were found to have pottery and other artifacts located around them. Earlier burials, usually those associated with the early occupation, have bones that are very dark in color which was most likely caused by their submersion when the lake levels rose. The early burials had tight constriction of the legs, which were usually pulled towards the torso, and arms. This suggests that their bodies might have been wrapped or bound with animal skin, ligament or basketry binding. According to Sereno (2008), the later burials are \\"most commonly in semi-flexed postures on either left or right sides.\\" Some of the remains uncovered at the area were decorated with jewelry, including a young girl wearing a bracelet made from the tusk of a hippo, and a man buried with the carapace of a turtle. A likely family grave was also found, with a woman and two children buried on their sides, facing each other and with hands entwined. They were buried with four hollow based points, and there was pollen evidence found at the probable family burial, suggesting that flowers decorated the grave.

It is best played in a large group of people, and does not require use of a table or playing surface. Gameplay is similar to Liar's dice or Liar's poker.  Gameplay  Object = The object of Commune is to be the last player remaining in the game. Players are removed from the game when they have received three penalties. Penalties are gathered through making invalid bids or calling valid bids. = Deal = At the beginning of each hand, each player is dealt one card more than the number of penalties they have. For example, a player with one penalty is dealt two cards. Players may look at their own cards, but must refrain from telling other players information about their hand. Twos are wild cards and may take on any value. = Bidding = Beginning with the player who last received a penalty, bidding proceeds clockwise. A bid is a poker hand that the bidder believes exists in the combined cards of all the players, known as the commune. Each successive bid must have a higher value than the previous, with the allowed hands being as follows: * High Card ‚Äì e.g. \\"jack high\\" ‚Äì valid if there is one or more card of the named rank in the commune * Pair ‚Äì e.g. \\"two sixes\\" ‚Äì valid if there are two or more cards of the named rank in the commune * Two Pair ‚Äì e.g. \\"eights and fours\\" ‚Äì valid if there are two or more cards of each of the named ranks in the commune * Three of a Kind ‚Äì e.g. \\"three queens\\" ‚Äì valid if there are three or more cards of the named rank in the commune * Straight ‚Äì e.g. \\"straight to nine\\" ‚Äì valid if all five consecutively numbered cards, up to and including the named rank, are in the commune * Full House ‚Äì e.g. \\"fives over kings\\" ‚Äì valid if there are three or more cards of the first named rank and two or more cards of the second named rank in the commune * Four of a Kind ‚Äì e.g. \\"four aces\\" ‚Äì valid if there are four or more cards of the named rank in the commune Note that flushes are not hands in Commune, because bidding gives no information about the suits of the cards in the commune. Also note that no bid may involve a two, for example, no player may bid \\"twos over queens\\" or \\"straight to six\\". = Calling = If a player believes that the previous bid is invalid, and does not exist in the commune, then he may announce so by declaring \\"call\\". When this happens, players reveal their cards and the validity of the bid is determined. If the bid was valid, the player who \\"called\\" receives a penalty. Otherwise, the bidder receives a penalty. The hand is then over and a new hand begins. = End Game = If a player receives three penalties then they are out. However, as players accrue more penalties, they receive more cards each hand and will thus have more information about the game, making it harder to force further penalties on them. Eventually, though, all players will receive their third penalty and drop out of the game. When only one player is left, that player is the winner.  Variations  Card Number Variations = A common variation when playing with two to four players is to play with up to 5 penalties, allowing the game to go on longer and for bigger hands to be bid. Another variation is that each player begins with 3 cards, and each penalty decreases the number of cards they are dealt. This makes for less drastic drops in the number of cards when a player drops out, but makes it easier for a player to lose as soon as they receive a few penalties. = Bidding Variations = Some variations allow flushes to be bid, as long as the bidder can name every rank in the flush, making it a rather rare bid. This also means that straight flushes can be bid, above four of a kinds but below five of a kinds. A final variation allows the bidding of hands larger than five cards: six of a kind, seven of a kind, and eight of a kind.

It is located at 4901 Eastern Avenue in Avondale, Maryland. It provides housing and support to pregnant and parenting young women and their children, as well as quality day care to the children of working families.St. Ann's Center for Children, Youth and Families - Our Programs History Prior to 1860 and the beginning of the Civil War, three Daughters of Charity came from Emmitsburg, Maryland, to Washington, D.C., where they established the city's first foundling home. In 1861, St. Ann's initiated its first education and job-training program to prepare single mothers to become family breadwinners.St. Ann's Infant and Maternity Home website - History On March 3, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln signed an Act of Congress to incorporate St. Ann's Infant Asylum, as it was then called. St. Ann's was chartered \\"for the purpose of establishing and maintaining in the city of Washington, in the District of Columbia, an institution for the maintenance and support of foundlings and infant orphan and half orphan children, and also to provide for deserving, indigent, and unprotected females during their confinement and childbirth.\\" The asylum was charged with caring for the city's growing number of abandoned children and unwed mothers of all races and religions, many of whom had no place else to turn. For 83 years St. Ann's occupied the old British Embassy at 24th Street and K Street, Northwest. In 1949, St. Ann's started providing affordable day care for working mothers with young children to further assist the Washington community. To meet the growing need for space and services, in 1962 St. Ann's moved from the city to a larger facility in Avondale, Maryland.\\"St. Ann's Children Take Quickly to New Home,\\" The Washington Post, Feb 3, 1962, p. C1. In 1996, it was expanded to include a transitional apartment facility to help impoverished, young single mothers, and their children, make the transition to independent living.

In 2012, the name was officially changed to St. Ann's Center for Children, Youth and Families to better reflect the full range of clients served and programs offered.  Programs  St. Ann's currently operates transitional housing programs for at-risk mothers and their children as well as a community day care center. As a residential facility, St. Ann's operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. = Teen Mother-Baby Program = The program offers residential care for pregnant adolescents and young mothers up to age 22 and their babies. Extensive services include an accredited high school, medical care, parenting classes, life skills training, day care, individual and family counseling, and social and cultural activities. = Supportive and Transitional Housing Program = In 1996, St. Ann's opened Faith House to address the critical housing need for young, homeless mothers in our community. In 2013, the organization expanded its transitional living program with the opening of Hope House, a new housing unit for homeless single mothers and their children. In the Faith House and Hope House programs, vulnerable young families receive resources and support to help them transition to financial independence and self-sufficiency in two years. = Child Care Center = St. Ann's Child Care Center provides affordable, developmental day care for infants and preschool children in the community and in residence, including children with special needs, and children from low-income, single parent families and from families in crisis.

Although Hesperogavialis is one of the best known gavialoids from South America, the posterior portion of the skull is still unknown, making any attempts at classification within the family somewhat more difficult than other gavialoids in which much of the skull is present. The genus possibly comprises three species. The type species, H. cruxenti, has been found in the Urumaco Formation in Venezuela. A second possible species, named H. bocquentini, has been described from the Solim√µes Formation in Acre, Brazil and can be distinguished from H. cruxenti by the asymmetry seen in the anterior portion of the nasals and the small distance between alveoli. A third species can be recognized from the same locality in Acre, although a formal name has yet to be given to it.Souza-Filho, J. P. (1999). New crocodylian fossils (Alligatoridae and Gavialidae) from the Cenozoic, Acre State, Brazil. Ameghiniana 36(Supplement to Number 4)  Phylogenetics  Although a South American gryposuchine, Hesperogavialis may actually have had closer relations to the extant Gavialis known from Asia. This has been concluded on the basis of a lack of a nasal-premaxillary contact on the rostrum that can be seen in the extinct South American gavialoids. The position of these bones bears a closer resemblance to Gavialis by being rather slender and extending from the orbits to the middle of the rostrum while being considerably separated from the premaxilla.Brochu, C. A. and Rinc√≥n, A. D. (2004). A gavialoid crocodylian from the lower Miocene of Venezuela. In: S√°nchez-Villagra, M. R., Clack, J. A., and Batten, D. J., eds., Fossils of the Miocene Castillo Formation, Venezuela: contributions on neotropical palaeontology. Special Papers in Palaeontology No. 71, The Palaeontological Association (London), p. 61-79. This close relationship suggests that there may have been multiple gavialid dispersal events from the Old World to South America. It has also been proposed that this is just an independently derived characteristic unique to Hesperogavialis among the gryposuchines, and that it does not suggest any relationship to Asian gavialoids.Langston, W. and Gasparini, Z.

It has since been reissued twice, with new editions appearing in 2001 and 2007. Overview The book examines the phenomenon of love and human connection from a combined scientific and cultural perspective. It attempts to reconcile the language and insights of humanistic inquiry and cultural wisdom (literature, song, poetry, painting, sculpture, dance and philosophy) with the more recent findings of social science, neuroscience and evolutionary biology. Presenting scientific facts and hypotheses through engaging prose, A General Theory of Love has been compared to the work of Steven Pinker and Oliver Sacks. Since its first publication, the book has been translated into Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Korean, Latvian, Croatian, and Persian. Contents The book surveys scientific understanding of emotions and particularly intimacy and love, from Freud through modern neuroscience, with a focus on the emerging understanding of the limbic brain and the development of personality. The authors put forward the idea that our nervous systems are not separate or self-contained; beginning in earliest childhood, the areas of our brain identified as the limbic system (hippocampus, amygdala, anterior thalamic nuclei, and limbic cortex) is affected by those closest to us (limbic resonance) and synchronizes with them (limbic regulation) in a way that has profound implications for personality and lifelong emotional health. The authors maintain that various forms of therapy are effective not so much by virtue of their underlying theory or methodology, but to the degree to which the therapist is able to empathetically modify these set patterns (limbic revision). The authors go on to examine how many aspects of our society and social institutions have been constructed in a way that is incompatible with our innate biology, which gives rise to individual and social pathologies. Critical reception A General Theory of Love received generally positive reviews, including Kirkus Reviews, Library Journal, the Washington Post, and the San Francisco Examiner. It reached number 5 slot on the San Francisco Chronicle's Non-Fiction best seller list. However, the book has been criticized for its \\"convoluted and opaque\\" prose style, as well as its extensive reliance on the model of the triune brain as defined by Paul D. MacLean, a model that has been variously categorized as obsolete, imprecise or unnecessary.

Plot summary  Kathleen \\"Katie\\" Chandler has been living and working in New York City for about a year, but originates from Texas. She has a job under a boss named Mimi, but she hates it. She is soon offered a mysterious job. When she looks into the job, it turns out that she is one of the 1% in the world who are immune to magic, and that the company offering her the job is a magic company called MSI Inc, which stands for Magic, Spells, and Illusions Inc. It soon becomes apparent that the world is in trouble from the evil wizard Phelan Idris and it is up to Katie and her friends to save it. Characters ;Katie Chandler: A young Texas woman who has been always ordinary. She discovers that she is one of the rare people who has absolutely no magic in them and so magic can not be used on her. Because of this immunity she is recruited by MSI as a verifier. She can see through every spell or veiling without exception. ;Owen Palmer: A shy, intelligent, powerful and gorgeous wizard who works for MSI. Owen works translating ancient spells. A former MSI employee, Phelan Idris, has a personal vendetta against him because Owen got him canned. ;Rod Gwaltney: Owen's best friend since boyhood, Rod is a playboy who hides his not so attractive visage behind a very handsome illusion. He and Owen are the ones who recruit Katie ;Merlin: The actual Merlin, from King Arthur. Merlin was woken from his enchanted sleep to help with some serious, imminent magical trouble. Merlin is very powerful and is fond of Katie, who teaches him about life in New York. ;Phelan Idris: A former MSI employee who worked with Owen. Idris was fired for dappling in dark magic, MSI is strictly good, and Owen was the one who turned him in. Idris is now selling his own evil spells and Katie, Owen, and Merlin have to stop him before it is too late. ;Ethan Wainwright: A lawyer who specializes in intellectual property. Katie and Ethan met on a date (He was set up with one of her roommates) and started talking about law. After consulting with Merlin, Katie asks Ethan out, mostly to find out if they had an intellectual property case against Idris. On their date Katie finds out that Ethan is an immune and recruits him to be a lawyer for MSI. ;Sam: The head of security for MSI and also a gargoyle. Katie had been seeing him around the city for months prior to finding out that magic exists ;Marcia & Gemma: Katie's roommates. Normal humans in every way (except maybe a little brighter and more beautiful). Katie is not allowed to tell them about magic and that is fine with her, she needs some normalcy in her life. It does cause problems, though, when Katie needs to sneak away to battle evil magicians, or when her friends start dating former frogs she freed from enchantment.

Early career  Boles≈Çaw was born around 1278 into the Silesian Piasts, as the oldest son of Duke Casimir of Bytom by his wife Helena. He was designed by his father to the Church career, despite the fact that he was the eldest son. Already 1294 he was appointed Scholastic of Krak√≥w, and three years later (in 1297), obtain the title of Canon of the Chapter of Wroc≈Çaw. A bull of Pope John XXII referred to Boles≈Çaw's \\"literacy in sciences\\". Hungarian historian Antal P√≥r considered that he is identical with that namesake provost of Opole, who functioned as rector of the ultramontanes at the University of Padua in May 1308. Polish historian Stanis≈Çaw Sroka called P√≥r's argument as hypothesis, but agreed, Boles≈Çaw may have been a student of an universitas in Italy, taking into account his Italian language skills and later diplomatic missions to the peninsula. Despite his church career, in 1303 Boles≈Çaw received from his father the town of Toszek years duchy, which formally remained under his rule until his death (although the real government of that land, after Boles≈Çaw's departure to Hungary, was performed by his younger brother W≈Çadys≈Çaw). After departing to Hungary, he gave up his former benefices in Poland, but still used the title of Duke of Toszek in his documents, albeit sporadically.  Archbishop of Esztergom Diplomatic missions= Around 1315 Boles≈Çaw, at the request of his sister, Queen Maria of Hungary, moved to the court of his brother-in-law King Charles I Robert in Buda; however, his career in the Hungarian hierarchy only began thanks to the efforts of Queen Elizabeth, Charles I's third and last wife (Queen Maria died in 1317). At the end of 1320, Boles≈Çaw went to the Krak√≥w court, and at the beginning of the next year (1321) the King Charles I gave him the most important and powerful position of the Hungarian church: the Archbishopric of Esztergom. His predecessor Thomas died in the first half of 1321. Subsequently, the cathedral chapter of Esztergom convened and elected Boles≈Çaw sometime 14 April, he was also styled as perpetual count of Esztergom County thereafter. Boles≈Çaw has not yet visited Avignon for papal confirmation, because Charles' eldest namesake son was born in that year and the archbishop- elect baptized him. Finally, Pope John XXII confirmed his election on 2 October 1321. Boles≈Çaw visited the papal court two months after his confirmation, in December, where he was consecrated as bishop by B√©renger Fredoli. In the name of the pope, cardinal Napoleone Orsini Frangipani sent his pallium on 5 December 1321. One of the greatest successes of Boles≈Çaw during his archiepiscopate was the normalization of the diplomatic relations between Hungary and Venice. In January 1322, two Dalmatian towns, ≈†ibenik and Trogir, rebelled against Mladen ≈†ubiƒá, who was a son of Charles's one-time leading partisan, Paul ≈†ubiƒá. The two towns also accepted the suzerainty of the Republic of Venice although Charles had urged Venice not to intervene in the conflict between his subjects. These countries (who had a long-lasting dispute over the Adriatic coast), finally entered into an agreement after the Archbishop's mediation, who visited the republic in the spring of that year: the rich cities of Dalmatia (who included Zadar and Split) were placed under Hungarian rule. Boles≈Çaw also participated in the royal campaign against the last rebellious lords, the ≈†ubiƒái and Baboniƒái in Croatia at the turn of 1322 and 1323. After their defeat, Charles had taken \\"full possession\\" of his kingdom, as one of his charters concluded. Charles I appointed Boles≈Çaw isp√°n of Po≈æega County in 1323 for his successful diplomatic mission to Venice. =Ecclesiastical affairs= Boles≈Çaw successfully recovered some estates and landholdings, which had formerly belonged to the archdiocese. For instance, Charles has returned Rozsny√≥b√°nya, Szelincs, V√°ga (present-day Ro≈æ≈àava, Zeleneƒç and V√°hovce in Slovakia, respectively) and T√ºrnye in 1323. However the recovery of Nezsider (today Neusiedl am See, Austria) was unsuccessful, despite even Pope John's intervention, as the donation letters were lost and Boles≈Çaw could not prove that the archdiocese was granted the land by King Andrew III's consort Queen Agnes. Boles≈Çaw personally visited the widow, who lived in the K√∂nigsfelden Monastery, in order to renew her donation, but he did not succeed. In addition to recover previously owned lands, Boles≈Çaw has increased the wealth of his archdiocese. He bought Cs√©v, Esztergom County for inexpensive 50 silver denari from Mik√≥ca Rosd, who, with that step, paid his debts, which existed since his act of unintentional homicide against a serf in Keszt√∂lc, a subject of the archdiocese. He also exchanged the estate of √ñlveld for Borch in 1327. During the first six years of his rule as Archbishop (1321‚Äì1326), Boles≈Çaw had to fight against an extreme Franciscan faction, the Fraticelli, who at that time were considered too radical by Pope John XXII. He expelled the order from the territory of the Kingdom of Hungary, ahead of the Pope's orders. In the autumn of 1322, Pope John appointed Boles≈Çaw as patron (conservator) of the Order of Saint Paul the First Hermit, alongside Ladislaus J√°nki, the Archbishop of Kalocsa and vice-chancellor Ladislaus, the provost of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. Boles≈Çaw reconfirmed the privileges of the Poor Clares of Pressburg (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia) on 1 April 1324. When Pope John called the Hungarian Benedictine abbots to convene their collegiate annually in order to restore discipline, he simultaneously commissioned metropolitans Boles≈Çaw and Ladislaus J√°nki to supervise the enforcement of the provision. Boles≈Çaw held a provincial synod in Esztergom on 8 November 1326. Though its edicts did not survive, a charter issued in Visegr√°d on 4 February 1327 summarizes the key elements. Accordingly, the synod was attended by the all suffragans, in addition to abbots, provosts and representants of cathedral chapters. There Henry, Bishop of Veszpr√©m filed a lawsuit against Boles≈Çaw, accusing him of unauthorized possession of some churches and their benefices in his diocese. After that the archbishop recommended to appoint each two trustees to pursue the probation procedure. The synod ruled in favour of Henry. Boles≈Çaw tried to delay the implementation and moved the place of the council to Visegr√°d. The archbishop did not present before the council until 20 January 1327, when he requested papal mediation and proceeding. Boles≈Çaw tried to maintain their jurisdiction over Spisz (Szepes), disputed by the Diocese of Krak√≥w. Its bishop Nanker complained to the Holy See in 1324 that archbishops Thomas and his successor Boles≈Çaw have exercised unjustifiably ecclesiastical authority over the Catholic communities of Podolin, Gn√©zda and Lubl√≥ (present-day Podol√≠nec, Hniezdne and Star√° ƒΩubov≈àa in Slovakia, respectively). On 15 June 1324, Pope John XXII instructed Bartholomew, the superior of the Premonstratensian monastery of CzarnowƒÖsy to investigate the case. By 1325, both Boles≈Çaw and Nanker selected their attorneys, along with John, provost of Szepes in April 1326. At first, representats of Esztergom did not appear before the court, later the trial delayed because of the deaths of Boles≈Çaw and Bartholomew in 1328. This conflict was only resolved in 1332, when Bartholomew's successor Prot ruled in favour of Krak√≥w, however the towns passed in the reign of Hungary in later in the second half of the 14th century, overwriting the verdict. At the end of his life, Boles≈Çaw fought for the approval of the election of his youngest brother Mieszko as Bishop of Nyitra (Nitra). The local chapter was against the nepotism, according to the complaint of its lector Stephen. The clergyman reported on 1 May 1328 that immediately after the death of their bishop John, they sent a delegation to King Charles, but their envoys were captured en route and imprisoned in Esztergom Castle by Boles≈Çaw's troops. There the archbishop persuaded the delegates to accept his brother as their bishop. Supporting his claim, the archiepiscopal banderium seized the St. Emmeram's Cathedral and its collegiate chapter. His soldiers threatened the canons with death, if they do not accept Mieszko as bishop. The full support shown to the Piast princes by King Charles and Queen Elizabeth ended that dispute with a complete success to Mieszko. Boles≈Çaw died in December 1328 and was buried in the cathedral in Esztergom. The Duchy of Toszek was then officially merged to Bytom by Duke W≈Çadys≈Çaw.

Broadcasting is multilingual, with Arabic, English, French and Urdu being represented.  History  In 1965, Qatar's first radio station was created. It was broadcast on Fridays and relayed the Quran, religious programs and news. This event paved the way for the official formation of Qatar Radio on 25 June 1968. Broadcasts were made from the Al Kheesa transmission station. Qatar Radio started broadcasting on a medium wave in Arabic for a total daily duration of five hours during two periods: one and a half hours in the morning, and three hours in the evening. At the close of 1968, the transmission was upgraded from 10 kilowatts to 50 kilowatts. Transmission hours were raised to nine hours in 1969, and by 1970 had been increased to 13 hours. By 1982 there were nineteen hours of transmission, and finally in 2002 Qatar Radio began non-stop transmission. In an effort to cater to non-Arabic speakers, an English program was established in 1971. It had a transmission duration of one hour at that time, eventually increasing to 19 hours by 2004. In 1979, Qatar Radio installed a new short-wave transmitter which assisted in increasing the number of programs and transmission time. The station began broadcasting Urdu transmissions in 1980 on a medium wavelength for a duration of one hour. This time was raised to three hours in 1989. A program for French speakers was launched in 1985 on a medium wave, having a daily up-time of three hours. The Holy Quran service was launched by Qatar Radio in 1992. It discusses various aspects of the Quran and tackles modern-day issues in the context of Islam.  Eurovision Song Contest  Qatar Radio is currently an associate member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), while all competing countries of the Eurovision Song Contest must be active members of the Union. The broadcaster first revealed on 12 May 2009 that they were interested in becoming active members of the Union, which would allow the nation to compete in the Contest. Qatar Radio has stated that they hope to join Eurovision by 2011. Qatar first became involved in the Contest at the 2009 edition, where the broadcaster sent a delegation to the contest and broadcast a weekly radio show called '12pointsqatar' dedicated to Eurovision, which received favourable responses and has initiated the further involvement of Qatar in Eurovision. Qatar Radio has said that they feel that they would be happy to join all other competitors in the contest, including Israel if Qatar gets membership. Qatar is required to have a broadcaster which has at least associate membership of the EBU in order to have a chance to take part, as Qatar Radio is only a radio station and Qatar lies outside the European Broadcasting Area and cannot apply for Council of Europe membership with Australia being the only exception after being an associate member for over 30 years. The broadcaster would most likely be Qatar Television (QTV) also owned and run by the Qatar General Broadcasting and Television Corporation. If Qatar Radio gets accepted too, then they would be able to air the contest alongside the television broadcast.

They have released three full length albums and one EP, as well as a collaboration with former techno artist Floorboard. They are currently signed with One Eleven Records. The band consists of two members, Travis Adams, former frontman from My Hotel Year and Davey Pierce who has worked with of Montreal. The band recently performed a small tour with of Montreal along the east coast. Their most recent album Rivers of Blood and Sadness, or Maybe Happy was released on iTunes music store April 21, 2009. History The band's sound features some standard alternative rock elements, but infuses indie, power pop, and even some ambient elements into their albums. The debut album, Chaos Reveals Rhyme was released June 7, 2005 through Amateur Records and received good listener reviews despite not getting much attention. The lack of stardom did not deter the duo from continuing their work. After being pursued by \\"One Eleven Records\\" and eventually signing on they created their next release, These Stars are Monsters, just over a year later: June 25, 2006. This album was hosted on iTunes music store as well as being sold on the record labels site. This album greatly increased the band's exposure, to the point where EA Sports put the song \\"Ecuador is Lovely This Time of Year\\" into NHL 07's soundtrack.http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/sports/nhl07/index.html?q=nhl%2007 The album also received raving reviews from some smaller outlets such as Hybrid magazine and Emotional Punk.http://www.hybridmagazine.com/reviews/0906/inkwell.shtml However punknews.org was less receptive but was one of the uncommon negative reviews of the album.http://www.punknews.org/review/5548 =Post 2006= Due to Davey Pierce's commitments with \\"of Montreal\\" the band took a break between the release of These Stars are Monsters and their upcoming work. During this time, Travis did a \\"My Hotel Year\\" reunion tour. Exactly one year after the release of These Stars are Monsters, the band posted an update on their Myspace page. They invited fans to help create clever song titles. One element of Inkwell's signature style is that none of their song titles reflect the actual lyrics. Shortly after this, it was announced that a few summer shows would be performed. =2008 works= December 30, 2008 marked the first release of standard Inkwell music since the second full length album. This EP, titled Flotsam, was made available through the iTunes Music Store. It was a collection of cast-off songs and a couple pieces of new material from the upcoming album. The first two songs appear on the latest album and are identical in production. The next three songs were songs that did not make the final cut from their three studio albums. One cut from each album was included. And finally, a remix of a Chaos Reveals Rhyme song was put on at the end. The EP received positive reviews, but to a lesser extent than These Stars are Monsters. This was to be expected to a degree as half the CD consists of songs the band did not give a final cut to.http://thealbumproject.net/category/one- liners/page/2/http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=792682 =Rivers of Blood and Sadness, or Maybe Happy= Inkwell released their third full length album on April 21, 2009.

Ecosystem management is a process that aims to conserve major ecological services and restore natural resources while meeting the socioeconomic, political, and cultural needs of current and future generations. The principal objective of ecosystem management is the efficient maintenance and socially appropriate use of natural resources.Szaro et al. (1998) It is a multifaceted and holistic approach which requires a significant change in how the natural and human environments are identified. Several different approaches to implementing ecosystem management exist and these involve conservation efforts at both local and landscape levels and involve: * Adaptive management * Natural resource management * Strategic management * Command and control management Formulations A variety of definitions exist. Robert T. Lackey defined ecosystem management as, \\"the application of ecological and social information, options, and constraints to achieve desired social benefits within a defined geographic area and over a specified period.\\" Lackey (1998) F. Stuart Chapin and coauthors define it as, \\"the application of ecological science to resource management to promote long-term sustainability of ecosystems and the delivery of essential ecosystem goods and services,\\" while Norman Christensen and coauthors define it as, \\"management driven by explicit goals, executed by policies, protocols, and practices, and made adaptable by monitoring and research based on our best understanding of the ecological interactions and processes necessary to sustain ecosystem structure and function.\\" Peter Brussard and colleagues defined it as \\"managing areas at various scales in such a way that ecosystem services and biological resources are preserved while appropriate human use and options for livelihood are sustained.\\" The definitions of ecosystem management are typically vague. Several core principles define and bound the concept and provide operational meaning: #ecosystem management reflects a stage in the continuing evolution of social values and priorities; it is neither a beginning nor an end; #ecosystem management is place-based and the boundaries of the place must be clearly and formally defined; #ecosystem management should maintain ecosystems in the appropriate condition to achieve desired social benefits; #ecosystem management should take advantage of the ability of ecosystems to respond to a variety of natural and man-made stressors, but all ecosystems have limited ability to accommodate stressors and maintain a desired state; #ecosystem management may or may not result in emphasis on biological diversity; #the term sustainability, if used at all in ecosystem management, should be clearly defined‚Äîspecifically, the time frame of concern, the benefits and costs of concern, and the relative priority of the benefits and costs; and #scientific information is important for effective ecosystem management, but is only one element in a decision-making process that is fundamentally one of public and private choice. A fundamental principle is the long-term sustainability of the production of goods and services by the ecosystem; \\"intergenerational sustainability [is] a precondition for management, not an afterthought\\". Ideally, there should be clear, publicly-stated goals with respect to future trajectories and behaviors of the system being managed. Other important requirements include a sound ecological understanding of the system, including connectedness, ecological dynamics and the context in which the system is embedded. An understanding of the role of humans as components of the ecosystems and the use of adaptive management is also important. While ecosystem management can be used as part of a plan for wilderness conservation, it can also be used in intensively managed ecosystems (see, for example, agroecosystem and close to nature forestry). As a concept of natural resource management, ecosystem management remains both ambiguous and controversial, in part because some of its formulations rest on policy and scientific assertions that are contested. These assertions are important to understanding much of the conflict surrounding ecosystem management. Professional natural resource managers, typically operating from within government bureaucracies and professional organizations, often mask debate over controversial assertions by depicting ecosystem management as an evolution of past management approaches.  History  Sustainable ecosystem management was used by large parts of populations thousands of years ago. Prior to colonization, Indigenous cultures across North America sustainably managed their natural resources through intergenerational Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK). These historical management strategies vary by region but vary from prescribed burning to permaculture farming. The adoption of the broad philosophy underlying ecosystem management is a recognition that technical and scientific knowledge, though necessary in all approaches to natural resource management, is insufficient. Science is merely one component of natural resource management and ecosystem management explicitly recognizes this fact. Stakeholders Stakeholders are individuals or groups of people who have an interest in or are affected by policy or management decisions and actions, but they also may have power to influence the goals, policies, and decisions relating to ecosystem management. The complex nature of decisions made in ecosystem management, from local to international scales, requires stakeholder participation with a diversity of knowledge, perceptions, and values of nature. Stakeholders will often have different interests in ecosystem services.Shepherd, G. (ed.) 2008. The Ecosystem Approach: Learning from Experience. International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, Gland, Switzerland This means that effective management of ecosystems requires a flexible management process that develops mutual trust in issues of common interest with the objective of creating mutually beneficial partnerships. Adaptive management Adaptive management is based on the concept that predicting future influences/disturbance to an ecosystem is limited and unclear. Therefore, the goal of adaptive management is to manage the ecosystem so it maintains the greatest amount of ecological integrity, but also to utilize management practices that have the ability to change based on new experience and insights.Holling, C. S. (1978). Adaptive Environmental Assessment and Management. Wiley, London. Reprinted by Blackburn Press in 2005Pahl-Wostl (2007) Adaptive management aims to identify uncertainties in the management of an ecosystem while using hypothesis testing to further understand the system.The Resilience Alliance, 2010. Adaptive Management. Viewed 8 September 2010. http://www.resalliance.org/600.php In this regard, adaptive management encourages learning from the outcomes of previously implemented management strategies. Ecosystem managers form hypotheses about the ecosystem and its functionality and then implement different management techniques to test the hypotheses.United States Department of Interior. Technical Guide: Chapter 1: What is Adaptive Management? Viewed 8 Sep. 2010.http://www.doi.gov/initiatives/AdaptiveManagement/TechGuide/Chapter1.pdf The implemented techniques are then analyzed to evaluate any regressions or improvements in functionality of the ecosystem caused by the technique. Further analysis allows for modification of the technique until it successfully meets the ecological needs of the ecosystem.Holling (1978) Thus, adaptive management serves as a ‚Äúlearning by doing‚Äù method for ecosystem management. Adaptive management has had mixed success in the field of ecosystem management, fisheries management, wildlife management, and forest management, possibly because ecosystem managers may not be equipped with the decision-making skills needed to undertake an adaptive management methodology.Gregory, R, Ohlson, D, Arvai, J, 2006. \\"Deconstructing adaptive management: criteria for applications to environmental management.\\" Ecological Applications. Vol. 16(6). pp. 2411‚Äì2425. Additionally, economic, social and political priorities can interfere with adaptive management decisions.Gregory et al. (2006) For this reason, adaptive management to be successful must be a social process as well as a scientific one, focusing on institutional strategies while implementing experimental management techniques.Resilience Alliance (2010) Natural resource management The term natural resource management is frequently used when dealing with a particular resource for human use rather than managing the whole ecosystem. A main objective of natural resources management is sustainability for future generations. One method to achieve this is by appointing ecosystem managers to balance natural resources exploitation and conservation over a long-term timeframe. The balanced relationship of each resource in an ecosystem is subject to change at different spatial and temporal scales.Boyce, MS, Haney, A, 1997. Ecosystem Management: Applications for Sustainable Forest and Wildlife Resources. Yale University Press. New Haven. Dimensions such as watersheds, soils, flora, and fauna need to be considered individually and on a landscape level. A variety of natural resources are utilized for food, medicine, energy and shelter.Chapin, F.S.III, Kofinas, G.P. and Floke, C. (2009). Principles of Ecosystem Stewardship. Resilience-Based Natural Resource Management in a Change World. Springer. The ecosystem management concept is based on the relationship between sustainable resource maintenance and human demand for use of natural resources.Boyce & Heney (1997) Therefore, socioeconomics factors significantly affect natural resource management.Kellert et al. (2000) The goal of a natural resource manager is to fulfill the demand for a given resource without causing harm to the ecosystem, or jeopardizing the future of the resource. Partnerships between ecosystem managers, natural resource managers and stakeholders should be encouraged in order to promote a more sustainable use of limited natural resources.Cork, S., Stoneham, G. and Lowe, K. (2007). Ecosystem Service and Australian Natural Resource Management (NRM) Futures. Paper to the Natural Resource Policy and Programs Committee (NRPPC) and the Natural Resource Management Standing Committee (NRMSC). Retrieved September 1, 2010 from http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/publications/ecosystem-services- and-australian-natural-resource-management-nrm-futures Natural resource managers must initially measure the overall condition of the ecosystem they are involved in. If the ecosystem's resources are healthy, managers can decide on the ideal amount of resource extraction, while leaving enough to allow the resource to replenish itself for subsequent harvests.Grimble & Wellard (1997) Historically, some natural resources have experienced limited human disturbance and therefore have been able to subsist naturally. However, some ecosystems, such as forests, which typically provide considerable timber resources; have sometimes undergone successful reforestation processes and consequently have accommodated the needs of future generations. A successfully managed resource will provide for current demand while leaving enough to repopulate and provide for future demand. Human populations have been increasing rapidly, introducing new stressors to ecosystems, such as climate change and influxes of invasive species. As a result, the demand for natural resources is unpredictable.Chapin et al. (2009) Although ecosystem changes may occur gradually, the cumulative changes can have negative effects for humans and wildlife.Ascher (2001) Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing Applications can be used to monitor and evaluate natural resources by mapping them in local and global scales. These tools will continue to be highly beneficial in natural resources management. Strategic management Strategic management encourages the establishment of goals that will sustain the ecosystem while keeping socioeconomic and politically relevant policy drivers in mind. Strategic management differs from other types of ecosystem management because it keeps stakeholders involved and relies on their input to develop the best management strategy for an ecosystem. Similarly to other modes of ecosystem management, this method places a high level of importance on evaluating and reviewing any changes, progress, or negative impacts and prioritizes flexibility in adapting management protocols as a result of new information. Landscape level conservation Landscape level conservation is a method that considers wildlife needs at a broader landscape level scale when implementing conservation initiatives.African Wildlife Foundation. Protecting Land. African Wildlife Foundation website. Viewed 9 September 2010. http://www.awf.org/section/land This approach to ecosystem management involves the consideration of broad scale interconnected ecological systems that acknowledges the whole scope of an environmental problem.Boyce & Haney (1997) In a human-dominated world, weighing the landscape requirements of wildlife versus the needs of humans is a complicated matter.Opdam, P, Wascher, D, 2003. \\"Climate change meets habitat fragmentation: linking landscape and biogeographical scale levels in research and conservation.\\" Biological Conservation. Vol. 117: 285-297. Landscape level conservation is carried out in a number of ways. A wildlife corridor, for example, is a connection between otherwise isolated habitat patches that are proposed as a solution to habitat fragmentation.Hudgens, BR, Haddad, NM, 2003. \\"Predicting Which Species Will Benefit from Corridors in Fragmented Landscapes from Population Growth Models.\\" The American Naturalist. Vol. 161(5): 808-820. In some landscape level conservation approaches, a key species vulnerable to landscape alteration is identified and its habitat requirements are assessed in order to identify the best option for protecting their ecosystem. However, lining up the habitat requirements of numerous species in an ecosystem can be difficult, which is why more comprehensive approaches to further understand these variations have been considered in landscape level conservation. Human-induced environmental degradation is an increasing problem globally, which is why landscape level ecology plays an important role in ecosystem management.Velazquez, A, Bocco, G, Romero, FJ, Perez Vega, A, 2003. \\"A Landscape Perspective on Biodiversity Conservation: The Case of Central Mexico.\\" Mountain Research and Development. Vol. 23(3): 230-246. Traditional conservation methods targeted at individual species need to be modified to include the maintenance of wildlife habitats through consideration of both human-induced and natural environmental factors.Velazquez et al. (2003) Command and control management Command and control management utilizes a linear problem solving approach where a perceived problem is solved through controlling devices such as laws, threats, contracts and/or agreements. This top-down approach is used across many disciplines and works best with problems that are relatively simple, well-defined and work in terms of cause and effect and for which there is broad societal agreement as to policy and management goals. The application of command and control management has often attempted to control nature in order to improve product extractions, establish predictability and reduce threats.Holling & Meffe (1996) Some obvious examples of command and control management actions include: the use of herbicides and pesticides to safeguard crops in order to harvest more products; the culling of predators in order to obtain larger, more reliable game species; and the safeguarding of timber supply, by suppressing forest fires. Attempts at command and control management often backfire (a literal problem in forests that have been ‚Äòprotected‚Äô from fire by humans and are subsequently full of fuel build-up) in ecosystems due to their inherent complexities. Consequently, there has been a transition away from command and control management due to many undesirable outcomes and a stronger focus has been placed on more holistic approaches that focus on adaptive management and finding solutions through partnerships.Knight & Meffe (1997) See also * Ecosystem-based management * Sustainable forest management * Sustainable land management References  * *Walters, C.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Arizona Diamondbacks, Milwaukee Brewers, Baltimore Orioles, Colorado Rockies, San Francisco Giants, and Washington Nationals. Parra is a two-time Gold Glove Award winner. He won the 2019 World Series with the Nationals. CareerArizona Diamondbacks= Arizona Diamondbacks in 2011 On May 13, 2009 he was called up from AA (Double A) Mobile BayBears when left fielder Conor Jackson was placed on the disabled list. He was inserted into the starting lineup the same day, and in his first Major League at bat he became the 100th player in MLB history to hit a home run in his first at bat. In his first five games he had at least one RBI, becoming the second player since Mike Lansing (1993) in the last 30 years to accomplish this feat. Parra was named NL Rookie of the Month for May and reached base in each of his first 17 games. In 2011, Parra broke out batting .292 with 8 home runs and 46 runs batted in. Not only did he do well offensively, he also established himself as a threat with his powerful throwing arm, throwing out runners on various occasions. He was a very underrated player in 2011 as he was a key ingredient in leading the Diamondbacks turnaround.http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/29807/gerardo-parra After an outstanding season defensively Parra was awarded the 2011 National League Left Fielder Gold Glove award on November 1, 2011. In an 18 inning game on 24‚Äì25 August 2013 at the Philadelphia Phillies, Parra collected a career- high five hits. The teams drew a combined 28 bases on balls, a National League record. The Diamondbacks' 18 walks tied the National League mark. The game lasted seven hours and six minutes, the longest in franchise history for both clubs. =Milwaukee Brewers= On July 31, 2014, the Diamondbacks traded Parra to the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for minor leaguers Mitch Haniger and Anthony Banda. Parra hit between Arizona and Milwaukee .261 with 9 home runs and 40 RBI's. =Baltimore Orioles= Parra with the Orioles in 2015 On July 31, 2015, he was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for Zach Davies. After a slow start with the O's, Parra tied a career-high in hits with five on August 16 in an 18-2 victory over the Oakland Athletics. The five hits were the most hits he had collected in a nine-inning game. =Colorado Rockies= Parra with the Rockies in 2018 On January 19, 2016, Parra signed a three-year contract with the Colorado Rockies. In his first season as a Rockie, he spent time on the disabled list. He played in 102 games, hitting just .253/.271/.399 with a strikeout to walk ratio of 73/9. He bounced back the following season, hitting career highs in average (.309) and RBIs (71). On April 13, 2018, Parra was suspended for four games due to his involvement in a brawl that occurred with the Padres two days prior. He ended his three year contract hitting .284/.342/.372 with 6 home runs and 53 runs batted in. On October 30, 2018, the Rockies declined the 2019 option on Parra's contract, instead paying him a $1.5 million buyout and making him a free agent. =San Francisco Giants= On February 12, 2019, Parra signed a minor league deal with the San Francisco Giants that included an invitation to spring training. In 30 major league games for the Giants, he batted .198/.278/.267. He was designated for assignment on May 3, 2019. =Washington Nationals= On May 9, 2019, Parra signed a one-year major league contract with the Washington Nationals. His first hit with the team was a go-ahead grand slam in a May 11 game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. In a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks on August 3, Parra was called upon to pitch in the 8th inning with the Nationals trailing 11‚Äì4. He gave up 5 runs on 1 hit and 4 walks before being replaced by another position player, Brian Dozier, and the Nationals eventually lost 18‚Äì7. The 25 career pitches thrown by Parra are the most without retiring a batter since at least 2000. In 2019 with the Nationals he batted .250/.300/.447. Between the Giants and the Nationals combined, in 2019 he batted .234/.293/.391 with nine home runs and 48 RBIs in 274 at bats. During his time with the Nationals, at the suggestion of his children, Parra changed his walk-up music to the popular children's song \\"Baby Shark\\". This became a crowd favorite throughout the second half of 2019, as crowds at Nationals Park began to sing along and do the accompanying motions whenever Parra came up to bat. Fans throughout the stadium were seen doing the \\"shark dance\\" when Parra was called up to bat in Game 4 of the 2019 National League Championship Series, and then again when Parra was called up to pinch-hit in Games 3, 4, and 5 of the 2019 World Series vs. the Houston Astros. The Nationals won the World Series in 7 games, their first in franchise history. =Yomiuri Giants= On November 20, 2019, Parra signed a one-year contract with the Yomiuri Giants of Nippon Professional Baseball.

The historic Kona coffee farm was established in 1900. The open-air agriculture museum depicts the daily lives of early Japanese immigrants to Hawaii during the period of 1920-1945. It is located at coordinates , the area now known as Captain Cook, but the traditional land division (ahupuaa) known as Kealakekua. History The farm was owned by Daisaku Uchida, who came to Hawaii from southern Japan at the age of 19 on September 27, 1906. After a three-year sugar contract at Lƒ´hue Plantation on Kauai, Daisaku came to the Kona District. Between 1868 and 1924, more than 140,000 Japanese workers came to Hawaii with labor contracts at sugarcane plantation. Many, like Uchida, decided to leave the plantations and start their own family businesses when their contract expired. In 1912, Daisaku married his cousin, Shima Maruo. They moved to the farm in 1913, expanding it and the house in 1925. The land was owned by the Greenwell family. Henry Nicholas Greenwell had been in the coffee trading business in the area since the 1870s. The Uchida family lived here until Shima died at the age of 73 in 1966, and Daisaku in 1986 at the age of 99. Three children were born in the original house, and three in the new one after 1925. The eldest son Masao Uchida also farmed the property until he and his wife Masako retired to Honolulu in 1994. =Preservation= The long-term leashold had finally run out, and the land was scheduled to be redeveloped into a residential subdivision. Since the farm had never been modernized, it was instead donated to the Kona Historical Society by Sherwood Greenwell. Museum The living history museum offers self-guided tours, that include the coffee orchard, farmhouse, and coffee mill. A kiosk is open to visitors, and a full tour by costumed interpreters from the Kona Historical Society is available at limited times. A fee is charged. The state registry of historic places listed the farm as site 10-47-7509 on April 16, 1994.Hawaii County Historic Places on State web site On February 9, 1995 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings on the island of Hawaii as site number 94001621. The original Henry Greenwell Store houses the Historical Society, and is also on the National Register. They are both located on the Mamalahoa Highway, known as the Hawaii Belt Road.

She is met with many challenges during each episode, e.g., finding enough members, bearing the weight of being captain, going through training, and experiencing some setbacks. With the help of her coach, childhood friend Sekino Hiroyuki (Nishikido Ryo), and the boys' rowing team, she and her team are able to overcome those obstacles. Ganbatte Ikimasshoi is a sports drama about hope, hard work, and perseverance. Synopsis Etsuko Shinomura, at first glance, seems to be a courageous and active girl. Actually, she has low self-esteem but hides it by acting boldly. She's a typical teenager who is interested in rowing. Etsuko lives with her family: her always cheerful mother, her father who runs a dry cleaning shop, and her lighthearted grandmother. Four years ago, her older sister entered the prestigious Kyoto University. Since childhood, Etsuko hated being compared with her smart sister. Although she successfully entered the famous Matsuyama High School this spring, she soon falls behind the others. One day, she happens to see four boys from the school's boat team rowing in unison. This sight lights a fire in Etsuko's heart, and she is determined to establish a girl's boating club. The problem is, not only does she hate sports, she also has anemia. Despite her difficulties, she actively takes part in forming a new club. Hiroyuki Sekino is Etsuko's neighbor and a member of the boy's boat team. He used to be overweight, but now he's a tall, handsome young man. He has a lot of friends because of his friendly personality. Hiroyuki is always in a good mood. What his friends don't know is that when he was a member of his middle school's soccer club, the pressure caused him to have a breakdown. At home, his parents' attention always went to his smart young brother. Etsuko has an uneasy feeling when she finds out how much girls at school like Hiroyuki. When they were kids, Hiroyuki and Etsuko never got along. Always fighting and quarreling, Hiroyuki once pushed Etsuko off a jungle gym. What Etsuko doesn't know is that Hiroyuki always has had a crush on her. Saburo Nakata belongs to the rugby club. His tall figure and handsome looks capture the girls' attention at school. Contrary to his idol-like looks, Saburo is a serious and dedicated guy. Brought up in an all-female family, he's seen plenty of the negative side of women. That's why Saburo is a bit timid when it comes to romance. He's not only brilliant, he's also a great athlete and is hoping to enter the prestigious Tokyo University. His dream is to get a job that will touch people's hearts. Saburo's \\"never give up\\" attitude is a positive influence on Etsuko and the girls who tend to give up easily. Rie Yano is the typical honor student. She shoulders the burden of her parents' expectations and is aiming to enter a national university and go to medical school. Rie is moved when she sees how dedicated and passionate Etsuko is when it comes to the girl's boat club, and decides to join the club herself. She has a tough time balancing her studies and club activities, but with her rich knowledge of Science, Rie makes a big contribution as a member of the maintenance crew. As the expert mechanic, she makes her presence on the team felt by all. Taeko Kikuchi stands out in the boat team with her bright-colored hair and pierced ears. Before joining the team, her strong personality gave the false impression that Taeko was the leader of a group of juvenile delinquents. But when she became friends with Etsuko and was moved by her passion for boats, Taeko joins the team. Soon, she becomes an essential member of the team. Her only weak point is that she's short-tempered. Hitomi Ohno was the star member of the award-winning girl's squad when Matsuyama High School previously had a girl's boat team. When Etsuko asks Hitomi to coach her team, she happily accepts, and teaches the girls the excitement of rowing. Hitomi's husband Ken, is the coach of the boy's boat club and still active in boat rowing. They've been married for four years, but Ken's worries about continuing the sport has created a gap between the couple. Yukio Shinomura is Etsuko's father and the owner of a dry cleaning store. He takes pride in what he does and refuses to buy computers and other new equipment for his store. Yukio likes to do it the old-fashioned way. While Yukio is always displaying his love and affection for Etsuko's elder sister, he seems strict when it comes to Etsuko. He often calls her a good-for-nothing, but Etsuko doesn't know that her father says these things to hide his true feelings. Yukio loves Etsuko more than anybody and cares for her greatly. He soon becomes the leader of the group cheering for Etsuko's boat club.

His surviving work runs to around 3 million words. Karl Gottlob K√ºhn of Leipzig (1754‚Äì1840) published an edition of 122 of Galen's writings between 1821 and 1833. His edition, which is the most complete, although flawed, consists of the Greek text with facing-page Latin translation.

The Five Orders of Periwigs (The Five Orders of Perriwigs as they were Worn at the Late Coronation Measured Architectonically) is a 1761 engraving by William Hogarth. It contains several levels of satire. First, and most clearly, it lampoons the fashion for outlandish wigs in the mid to late 18th century. Second, in classifying the wigs into \\"orders\\", it satirises the formulation of canons of beauty from the analysis of surviving pieces of classical architecture and sculpture from ancient Greece and ancient Rome, particularly the precise drawings of James \\"Athenian\\" Stuart (published in the Antiquities of Athens, the first volume of which appeared in 1762). To the lower right, the engraving gives its publication date as 15 October 1761. Of the engraving, Hogarth himself commented in his book of anecdotes: :There is no great difficulty in measuring the length, breadth, or height of any figures, where the parts are made up of plain lines. It requires no more skill to take the dimensions of a pillar or cornice, than to measure a square box, and yet the man who does the latter is neglected, and he who accomplishes the former, is considered as a miracle of genius; but I suppose he receives his honours for the distance he has travelled to do his business. As a parallel to the five orders of classical architecture identified by Palladio (Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, Composite and Tuscan), the engraving postulates five \\"orders\\" of periwig, from the relatively simple \\"Episcopal\\" (for the clergy), through the \\"Old Peerian or Aldermanic\\" (for lords and council officials) and \\"Lexonic\\" (for lawyers) to the more ornate \\"Composite or Half Natural\\", and finally the effete \\"Queerinthian or Queue de Reynard\\" (a pun on the French for \\"foxtail\\"). A scale shows the \\"Athenian Measure\\" by which the dimensions of each wig are annotated, with one \\"nodule\\" comprising 3 \\"nasos\\" (noses) and each \\"naso\\" of 3 \\"minutes\\". The component parts of each wig are labelled with letters A to I, each denoting a mock architectural term, from A: the \\"Corona or Lermier or Foretop\\" and B: the \\"Architrave or Archivolt or Caul\\" to H: \\"Fillet or Ribbon\\" and I: \\"Helices or Volute or Spiral or Curl\\". Several of the faces depicted have been identified. Those in the Episcopal line are intended to resemble Doctor William Warburton, Bishop of Gloucester (left) and Doctor Samuel Squire, Bishop of St David's (right). In the \\"Old Peerian or Aldermanic\\" row are Lord Melcombe (left) and another. The wig depicted to the far right is a \\"remarkable winged periwig\\" worn by Sir Samuel Fludyer, 1st Baronet when he became Lord Mayor of London earlier in 1761. At the bottom of the engraving is an inscription stating that a series of six folio volumes published over 17 years will set out the measurements of the periwigs of the ancients. This satirises Stuart's Antiquities of Athens. Above, a line of female profiles shows, from left to right, the face of Queen Charlotte and five others, each wearing a triple necklace and bearing a coronet: a duchess, a marchioness, a countess, a viscountess, and a baroness. They have been alternatively identified as the Ladies of the Bedchamber in 1761: the Duchess of Ancaster, Duchess of Hamilton, Countess of Effingham, Countess of Northumberland, Viscountess Weymouth, and Viscountess Bolingbroke. Hogarth created the engraving a few weeks after the coronation of George III and Queen Charlotte, inspired by the elaborate costume worn by those who attended. Horace Walpole wrote: \\"Some of the peeresses were dressed over night, slept in armchairs, and were waked if they tumbled their heads\\". A number of spelling mistakes were noted in the first state of the engraving (\\"\\", \\"\\"). A second state of the engraving corrects a typographical error by inserting the letter \\"e\\" in \\"\\", and relabels the \\"Episcopal\\" order of periwigs as \\"Episcopal and Parsonic\\".

Its responsibilities include the investigation and prosecution of cases involving contraband, illegal drugs, financial evasion and violations, money laundering, surveillance for financial police purposes and the provision of judicial police services. Its activities can be compared in USA with agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration, ATF, or some of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection HistoryOrigins= The origin of the service goes back to the creation of a paramilitary organization (called in Spanish Resguardo) to protect the monopoly of tobacco of the Tabacalera (the oldest tobacco company in the world), a Spanish tobacco monopoly which was established in 1636. The primary duty of the Resguardo was to protect the monopoly that the State exercised over the tobacco, combatting smuggling since its trade was one of the primary sources of funds of the Spanish Royal Treasury between the seventeenth and the 18th centuries. =Recent history= Recent history of the service begins in 1944 with the creation of the Servicio Especial de Vigilancia Mar√≠tima y Terrestre de Tabacalera S.A. (Special Service of Maritime and Terrestrial Surveillance from Tabacalera) charged of preventing the tobacco contraband. In 1954 due to the ineffectiveness of the service its duties were assumed by the Spanish Treasury who reorganized the service and created the Servicio Especial de Vigilancia Fiscal (Special Service of Fiscal Surveillance), made up of military and civilian personnel, which assumed the task of fighting the contraband. In 1982 the service was reorganized under the Servicio de Vigilancia Aduanera (Customs Surveillance Service) and its duties were broadened to include the investigation of economic crimes and the fight against illegal drugs, among other roles. Activities The most common duties of the SVA are regulated by the Royal Decree 319/1982 and the Organic Law against contraband 12/1995. Those are the investigation, discovery and prosecution of contraband violations throughout the nation, territorial waters and airspace. The force also has powers conferred by the Spanish Tax Agency (Agencia Tributaria) regarding economic crimes, including the fight against corruption, fraud investigation in foreign trade and money laundering, among other roles. The SVA cooperates with international and European organizations such as the European Anti-Fraud Office, Europol or the World Customs Organization.

The school was first held on the \\"back porch\\" of the Hockings' house on Quincy Street in Cambridge.Handbook of Private Schools, Boston: P. Sargent, 1920 The school enrollment quickly outgrew the Hocking home, and the Cooperative Open Air School (as it was originally known) moved to the Charles Eliot Norton estate at the corner of Scott and Holden Streets in Cambridge. The school took its current name from this location: Shady Hill Square, before moving to the school's current location on Coolidge Hill, also in Cambridge. Campus The Shady Hill School campus features eleven acres of tree-lined paths, wetlands, and ample grassy areas for play and team sports. The campus includes nineteen buildings: an art, woodshop, and music center; library; gymnasium; science laboratories; a STEAM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) building known as the hub which includes a makerspace; an assembly hall; and a number of child-scaled classroom buildings. The Hub is connected to the gym and used to be another gym.

Early life and education The third of nine children, Thomas Paprocki was born in Chicago, Illinois; he has six brothers and two sisters. A lifelong fan of hockey - who is sometimes referred to in the media as the \\"Holy Goalie\\" -, he began playing at a young age in the basement of his father's drugstore and supports the Chicago Blackhawks. He graduated from Quigley Preparatory Seminary South in 1970, and then entered Niles College, where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1974. From 1974 to 1979, he studied at St. Mary of the Lake Seminary, where he earned a Bachelor's in Sacred Theology (1976), Master's in Divinity (1978), and Licentiate in Sacred Theology (1979). Ordination and ministry Paprocki was ordained to the priesthood by John Cardinal Cody on May 10, 1978, and then served as associate pastor at St. Michael's Church in South Chicago until 1983. In 1981, he earned his Juris Doctor from DePaul University College of Law and founded the Chicago Legal Clinic to assist the working poor and disadvantaged. Paprocki served as administrator of St. Joseph Church in Chicago from 1983 to 1986 and as vice- chancellor of the Archdiocese of Chicago from 1985 to 1987. He then furthered his studies in Rome at the Pontifical Gregorian University, where he obtained a Licentiate of Canon Law (1989) and a Doctor of Canon Law degree (1991). Upon his return to the United States, he was named chancellor of the archdiocese in 1992 and later pastor of St. Constance Church in 2000. In 2013 he received an MBA from the University of Notre Dame. Auxiliary Bishop of Chicago On January 24, 2003, Paprocki was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Chicago and Titular Bishop of Vulturaria by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following March 19 from Francis Cardinal George, O.M.I., with bishops Raymond E. Goedert and Ricardo Watty Urquidi, M.Sp.S., serving as co-consecrators. As an auxiliary, he served as Episcopal Vicar for Vicariate IV, and as the cardinal's liaison for Polonia and for health and hospital affairs. He is also a member of the boards of directors of the Polish American Association and the Polish American Leadership Initiative. When the Governor of Illinois, Rod Blagojevich, issued an executive order in 2005 requiring all pharmacists in the state to dispense prescription contraceptives, Paprocki condemned the order in Blagojevich's presence, saying, \\"I am dismayed that our secular society has reached the point that individuals are being required by law to violate their personal religious beliefs in order to accommodate the selfish demands of special interest groups.\\" In November 2008, Paprocki spoke out against the Freedom of Choice Act (FOCA), saying, \\"It could mean discontinuing obstetrics in our hospitals, and we may need to consider taking the drastic step of closing our Catholic hospitals entirely. It would not be sufficient to withdraw our sponsorship or to sell them to someone who would perform abortions. That would be a morally unacceptable cooperation in evil.\\" In a subsequent interview with The Chicago Tribune, he reaffirmed his position, saying, \\"If Catholic hospitals were required by federal law to perform abortions, we'd have to close our hospitals.\\" When remarking about who was responsible for the sexual abuse crises in the Catholic Church, Paprocki said that the devil was the principal force behind the lawsuits. Bishop of Springfield On April 20, 2010, Paprocki was appointed as the Bishop of Springfield by Pope Benedict XVI. He was installed at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception on June 22, 2010. In November 2010, he organized a conference on exorcism. In April 2012, Paprocki was named as part of a three- member board of American Catholic Bishops charged by the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) with a multi-year investigation into the U.S. Leadership Conference of Women Religious (LCWR). He coined the name of the Fortnight for Freedom, a campaign of the American bishops on behalf of religious liberty. Paprocki is Episcopal Board Chairman for the Catholic Athletes for Christ, and is the author of Holy Goals for Body and Soul. =Politics= In September 2012, Paprocki wrote a column in his diocese's Catholic Times newspaper about the upcoming elections. He declared that voting for a candidate who promotes actions or behaviors that are \\"intrinsically evil and gravely sinful\\" makes one \\"morally complicit\\" and places the eternal salvation of the soul in \\"serious jeopardy.\\" His article went on at length discussing how in his view the Democratic Party embraced objectionable doctrines, such as abortion and same-sex marriage. Paprocki took notice of the Republican Party's support for capital punishment in murder cases, stating that this did not directly conflict with Church teaching. He also argued that party differences over caring for the poor and immigration were \\"prudential judgments about the most effective means of achieving morally desirable ends, not intrinsic evils.\\" Ahead of the 2016 elections, Paprocki denounced the Democratic Party for its \\"aggressive pro-abortion stance and activist agenda expanding lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender rights,\\" adding that Republicans \\"have not fared very well in these same areas.\\" He wrote that Democrats, who \\"articulate strong concern for the poor,\\" have made little progress in fighting poverty. Paprocki said that Catholics could choose not to vote for either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. =Opposition to abortion= In February 2018, Paprocki officially upheld a previous decision to bar U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, a Catholic in his diocese, from receiving Holy Communion after the Senator voted against a 20-week abortion ban. \\"In April 2004, Sen. Durbin's pastor, then Msgr. Kevin Vann (now Bishop Kevin Vann of Orange, CA), said that he would be reticent to give Sen. Durbin Holy Communion because his pro-abortion position put him outside of communion or unity with the Church's teachings on life,\\" Paprocki said. \\"My predecessor, now Archbishop George Lucas of Omaha, said that he would support that decision. I have continued that position.\\" Paprocki said that the \\"provision is intended not to punish, but to bring about a change of heart.\\" On June 6, 2019, Paprocki issued a decree officially barring Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton from presenting themselves to receive the Eucharist on account of their role in Passing the Reproductive Health Act, which removes spousal consent and waiting periods for abortions. While singling out Madigan and Cullerton specifically, Paprocki also asked that other legislators who voted for the bill not present themselves for Communion either, stating that they had \\"cooperated in evil and committed grave sin.\\" Madigan stated that Paprocki had informed him earlier that he would be forbidden from taking the sacrament if he permitted the House to debate and vote on the measure, but that he chose to do so. =Opposition to same-sex marriage= In November 2013, Paprocki said that Satan was behind recent Illinois legalization of same-sex marriage and held an exorcism ceremony, during which he read the exorcism rite \\"in reparation for the sin of same-sex marriage\\". On June 23, 2017 Paprocki instructed priests in his diocese to \\"deny Communion, last rites and funeral rites to people in same-sex marriages ‚Äì unless they repent\\". He prohibited clergy and parish staff from either performing same-sex marriages or allowing wedding receptions to be hosted in any facilities or centres owned by the Catholic church. This was followed by strong criticism. Michael Sean Winters of the National Catholic Reporter called for Paprocki to be \\"sacked.\\" Christopher Pett, incoming President of DignityUSA, described the decree as \\"mean-spirited and hurtful in the extreme.\\" Paprocki defended his position as \\"a rather straightforward application of existing Church teaching and canon law.\\" In July 2017, he stated publicly that Catholic politicians who have been involved in making same-sex marriage legal in the United States should refrain from Holy Communion until they had sought forgiveness in the confessional. Paprocki has been critical of the Jesuit priest James Martin, whose outreach to the LGBT community has drawn opposition from conservative Catholics. According to Paprocki, Martin \\"correctly expresses God‚Äôs love for all people, while on the other, he either encourages or fails to correct behavior that separates a person from that very love. This is deeply scandalous in the sense of leading people to believe that wrongful behavior is not sinful.\\" =Opposition to labor unions= Paprocki dissented from the amicus brief filed by the Bishops' Conference in support of labor unions in the Janus case. The bishops had affirmed the Church's traditional teaching in support for unions, citing various Church documents. Paprocki disagreed with the amicus brief. He instead supported the mandatory open shop for public employers. Paprocki has not been a visitor or spiritual guide at union halls but has collaborated with Legatus, and organization of Catholic corporate executives. He has also preached for lawyers and MBA executives. However, it must be said that Bishop Paprocki's stance makes a clear distinction in regards to unions: Although he did support the Janus ruling and respectfully rejected the USCCB's amicus brief, Paprocki did so in order to defend the conscience of the Catholic worker. Paprocki asserts that some labor unions support anti-Catholic stances; therefore, his approach defends the right of the worker to not support said groups that violate conscience. This distinction makes his opposition merely conditional; unions that are not contrary to Catholic teaching are not ruled out Ipso facto. The bishop explains this in a video he released, and he cites Pope Leo XIII's critical encyclical Rerum novarum paragraph 57 in order to show that although the Church has supported unions, said support has never been unconditional: \\"To sum up, then, We may lay it down as a general and lasting law that working men's associations should be so organized and governed as to furnish the best and most suitable means for attaining what is aimed at, that is to say, for helping each individual member to better his condition to the utmost in body, soul, and property. It is clear that they must pay special and chief attention to the duties of religion and morality, and that social betterment should have this chiefly in view; otherwise they would lose wholly their special character, and end by becoming little better than those societies which take no account whatever of religion. What advantage can it be to a working man to obtain by means of a society material well-being, if he endangers his soul for lack of spiritual food?\\" =Criticism of sexual abuse= In response to 2018 allegations by Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan√≤ that Pope Francis coverruped up allegations of sexual abuse against former-cardinal Theodore McCarrick, Paprocki called on all Vatican officials, including Francis, to \\"make public the pertinent files indicating who knew what and when...and provide the accountability that the Holy Father has promised.\\" Paprocki criticized Pope Francis for declining to answer a question about whether or not the accusations were true, saying, \\"Frankly, but with all due respect, that response is not adequate.\\" Paprocki called for \\"public prayers of repentance and acts of atonement\\" after reports of widespread sexual abuse and coverrup in the Catholic Church.

Biography Jonas was born in Exeter, England to Annie Ezekiel and Benjamin Jonas. Abraham's brother, Joseph Jonas, moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, becoming the first Jew to settle west of the Allegheny Mountains.Frolic, David A. (1998) \\"From Immigration to Integration: Jewish Life in Quincy in the Nineteenth Century\\". Abraham and his brother Edward joined Joseph in Cincinnati in 1819. Abraham and his two brothers were original members of Congregation B'nai Israel (Sons of Israel), the first Jewish congregation west of the Allegheny Mountains. Abraham also joined the Freemasons in Cincinnati. He and Joseph married Lucy and Rachel Seixas; daughters of the first Rabbi born in America ‚Äì Gershom Mendes Seixas. Lucy suddenly died in 1825, and Abraham moved to Williamstown, Kentucky. There he married Louisa Block from a pioneering Jewish American family and operated a general store. He was elected to the state legislature for four years. While in Kentucky, Abraham organized a Masonic Lodge and was eventually elected Master of the lodge in 1832.Landrum, Carl. (January 31, 1971) \\"Lincoln and the Jonas Family\\", Landrum's Quincy, Volume 2, Quincy Herald-Whig. During that time he and Louisa had five children. In 1836 he moved to Columbus in Adams County, Illinois, to operate a general store. Within two years he moved to Quincy, Illinois opening a carriage business and studying law in Orville Browning's office. He then organized the Grand Masonic Lodge of Illinois in 1840 and was elected Grand Master. In 1842 he was elected as a Whig to the state legislature. Lucy and Abraham had three more children around this time. He decided to establish a law partnership with Henry Asbury, turning over the family business to his brothers Edward and Samuel who had joined him in Quincy in 1840 or 1841. Although Abraham Lincoln was no longer in the Illinois General Assembly, it is likely that Jonas met Lincoln during Jonas's service in the legislature in Springfield. Jonas ran for the Illinois Senate in 1844 but was defeated by the Democratic candidate. But his loyalty to the Whig party earned him the position as postmaster of Quincy in 1849 serving until 1853. Lincoln and Jonas remained dear friends during this time. When the Whig party died, Jonas and Lincoln both joined the new Republican Party. On November 1, 1854 Lincoln was accused of attending a Know-Nothing Party meeting, but was vouched by Jonas who he was actually with.Landrum, Carl. (August 29, 1982) \\"Abraham Jonas ‚Äì Early Leader Here\\". Quincy Herald-Whig. Jonas arranged the 1858 Lincoln- Douglas debate in Quincy, and aided Lincoln to his candidacy. It was his law partner Henry Asbury who suggested Lincoln's candidacy in front of a group of local Republicans. Asbury's suggestion was greeted by silence until Jonas agreed that it would be a good idea. Abraham Jonas was noted as one of the greatest orators himself in the area.Mehlman, Mike. (2001) \\"One of Lincoln's Most Valued Friends\\". Lincoln Herald. He was elected Grand Orator of the Grand Lodge of Illinois in 1843. Lincoln appointed Jonas postmaster of Quincy in 1861 until his death in 1864. Jonas had seven children, six sons and a daughter. Four of his sons, including future U.S. Senator Benjamin F. Jonas, fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War, being residents of Louisiana; two others fought for the Union. Lincoln personally ordered the release of his son Charles Jonas from a prisoner of war camp to be at his father's bedside before he died.

It was a double track incline on the South Side Slopes of Pittsburgh from Josephine St. to Salisbury St. The lower station was near the intersection of S. 22nd Street and Josephine. The upper station was on Salisbury Street across from the former Fort Laughlin site eventually occupied by Arlington Playground. The incline was long, with a vertical rise of . It was designed by engineer J. H. McRoberts. As it carried both freight and passengers over steep tracks laid on the ground, it could be considered to be a cable railway. Its path was not of constant slope but became progressively steeper toward the top, tracing a parabolic arc. It is uncertain exactly when the incline closed permanently, but it was reported as shut down in a 1932 Associated Press article about the \\"passing\\" of Pittsburgh's inclines. The structure was dismantled in 1934. Fatal Accidents At 3:30 in the morning of April 6, 1909, an accident occurred when engineer Jesse Burton fainted against the controls, releasing the brake. As the upbound car reached the top, it slammed into the upper support, bounced away and rolled freely back down the grade. The impact had knocked both cables from their drums, so the car at the lower station did not provide a counterbalance on the move. The night turn had ended shortly before at D.O. Cunningham Glass on Jane St. near the lower station, and the upbound car was taking some passengers home. After the impact at the top, three young men jumped during their descent. One, Frank Bredl, 17, jumped early and survived. The others, Albert Klingenberger, 16, and Arthur Miller, 17, died from their injuries. A postcard of the era showed the aftermath of the accident. On July 22, 1915, a car ran over a 19-month-old baby who attempted to follow his two older sisters across the tracks.

During World War I she came under the control of the United States Shipping Board, and the United States Army chartered her on 15 October 1917 to haul Army cargo during World War I. The U.S. Navy acquired Cauto from the Shipping Board for World War I service on 12 July 1918, assigned her the naval registry Identification Number (Id. No.) 1538, and commissioned as USS Cauto on 13 July 1918 with Lieutenant Commander J. R. Curtis, USNRF, in command. Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, Cauto was outfitted for naval service at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Between 21 July 1918 and 9 February 1919, Cauto made three round-trip transatlantic voyages between the United States and France, carrying supplies for the American Expeditionary Force in France. Cauto was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 22 February 1919 and transferred to the U.S. Shipping Board for return to the New York and Cuba Mail Steamship Company.

Craftsmanship The egg was created by Faberg√©'s workmaster, Henrik Wigstr√∂m (Finnish, 1860‚Äì1923) is made of silver, gold, opalescent white and translucent red enamel, watercolor on gold and glass. The white enamel on this gold-mounted egg is decorated with a translucent red enamel cross on either side. The egg measures . The center of each cross is set with a painted miniature of respectively Grand Duchess Olga and Grand Duchess Tatiana in their Red Cross uniforms. The front cross with the portrait of Tatiana serves as a clasp, securing the double opening doors. The front of the egg divides into two quarters when opened, reveals a triptych within. The central scene is the Harrowing of Hell, the Orthodox representation of the Resurrection. Saint Olga, the founder of Christianity in Russia is represented on the left wing of the triptych. The martyr Saint Tatiana on the right. The interior miniatures are executed by Adrian Prachow, who specialized in icons. The remaining two panels of the doors are inscribed with the crown monogram of the tsarina, and the other one with the year \\"1915\\". The two miniature portraits of the two Grand Duchesses are probably by the court painter Vasilii Zuiev, who painted the miniatures for the companion Red Cross with Imperial Portraits Egg.

In Japanese Buddhism, it is a type of good deed, and was done as a type of puja.  Description  In the Nara period, the practice of copying sutras was the center of Buddhism in the country, and was done as a government project. During the Heian period, however, the idea of Pure Land Buddhism spread, and with it the objective of doing personal prayer. In the middle part of the Heian period, it was predicted that the mapp≈ç age would come into existence, and it was said that this would start in China and Korea. The Lotus Sutra was the main sutra that was buried, but the Heart Sutra, Amitabha Sutra, Mahavairocana Tantra, Vajrasekhara Sutra were also buried. In other locations, the Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings, Kannon sutra, and opening and closing sutras were also found. The sutras were usually copied onto paper, but materials like clay, copper, pebbles and shells were also used. The sutras were stored in metal vessels called , and inscriptions were written on them. The sutra tubes were small, but some hexagon-shaped boxes and two-storied pagoda shapes with affixed ornaments were found. The tubes also had caps on them. The tubes were usually made of metal or ceramics, but bamboo and other containers have also been found. The tubes were buried with ancient mirrors, coins, swords and jewels, and were buried with dehumidification substances like charcoal. The sutra tubes were often buried in sacred places such as mountain summits and on the grounds of Shinto temples. Occasionally they were buried underground or above ground, and stone huts were built to enshrine their contents.  History  For Japanese buildings, in 1007, Fujiwara no Michinaga built the oldest sutra mound at the summit of Kinpusen, a mountain range in Yamato Province. He did so because there was a sense of impending danger about the coming of mapp≈ç among the aristocracy, and he wanted to prepare for the coming of Maitreya and ensure that the sutras would be passed along to future generations. In the middle of the 12th century, a monk who traveled around the country went around handing out copies of the sutras to the masses as a way of improving his spirit and puja.  Recent times  Since they were first buried, the small sutra tubes have decayed, so instead, sutra words have been written on small flat stones. Mounds containing stones where one character has been written on each, and mounds with multiple characters on each stone, became more popular. There are places where the stones were buried and covered up and a memorial stone was placed. In recent centuries, an increase in agriculture and the permeation of a monetary economy has moved religious actions to the background. Giving copied sutras to temples has become standard as a way to spread knowledge about the sutras. Clay tile sutras While the ritual burial of s≈´tra, typically on paper, is known from over two thousand two hundred sites, at several that date to the late-Heian period, have been found. The text was incised into clay tiles that were then low fired; the selection of a more durable medium may have had some symbolic significance. Several examples have been excavated in Fukuoka Prefecture. A clay tile sutra mound in Itano is among the Historic Sites of Tokushima Prefecture.

The first was area code 206 which at the time covered all the state. In 1957, the state was divided in half when area code 509 was created to cover Eastern Washington leaving 206 to cover Western Washington. In 1995, 206 was split again covering just the Puget Sound region after area code 360 was created to cover the remaining area. In 1997, area code 425 was created from Seattle's Eastside suburbs and area code 253 for the Tacoma area, leaving 206 to cover just the city of Seattle, closely neighboring cities in King and Snohomish counties, and Bainbridge Island in Kitsap County. Area code 564 was approved on May 19, 2016 by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission for new numbers in the 360 area code, with assignments starting in 2017.http://www.king5.com/news/local/new-564-area-code-coming-to-western- washington/205026751 Area codes and major citiesArea code 206, Seattle= Area code 206 is the North American area code for Seattle; nearby Mercer Island, Bainbridge Island and Vashon Island; and portions of the Seattle metro area from Des Moines to Woodway. Area code 206 was one of the original area codes created in 1947. In 1957, area code 509 was created for the area east of the Cascades in a flash-cut. It split to form area 360 (one of the first 2 area codes not of N0X/N1X form) in 1995, and underwent a 3-way split in 1997 to form areas 253 and 425. =Area code 253, Tacoma= Area code 253 is a telephone dialing code for the suburbs south of Seattle and the South Puget Sound region, centered at Tacoma and extending to include the areas around Gig Harbor, Auburn, and Roy. It currently serves Federal Way and the western half of Pierce County. The area code went into service on April 27, 1997 as part of a three-way split of area code 206. =Area code 360, Western Washington= Area code 360 is the area code for Western Washington outside the greater Seattle metropolitan area, including the capital, Olympia. It began service on January 15, 1995. The area, which encompasses all of western Washington outside of urban King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties and Bainbridge Island, was previously part of area code 206. The 360 area code was one of the first two area codes that did not take the N1X or N0X form (i.e., the middle digit is neither 0 nor 1) in the North American Numbering Plan, along with Alabama area code 334, which began service on the same day. =Area code 425, Everett and the Eastside= Area code 425 is a telephone dialing code for the suburbs north and east of Seattle, particularly the Eastside, extending east to Snoqualmie Summit ski resort (most of which is in Kittitas County),Contact, Summit at Snoqualmie, accessed June 20, 2020 north to Everett, and south to Maple Valley. The area code went into service on April 27, 1997 as part of a three-way split of area code 206. =Area code 509, Eastern Washington= Area code 509 is an area code covering Eastern Washington, including Spokane, the Tri-Cities, Yakima, Walla Walla, and Wenatchee. It was created in a split from area code 206 in a flash-cut on January 1, 1957. =Area code 564, Western Washington= Area code 564 is a recently approved area code covering all of Western Washington, including Seattle. It is part of the overlay plan for area codes 206, 253, 360 and 425. This was approved on May 19, 2016 to be implemented starting in the fall of 2017 for new phone numbers. In 1999, the 564 area code was proposed as an overlay of area code 360, which serves areas of Western Washington outside of the Seattle-Tacoma metropolitan area. This version of the NPA was slated for implementation on July 29, 2000. Later, the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC) determined that the actual increase in need for new numbers in 360 had fallen short of projections, and postponed the NPA until at least February 2001. In May 2000, the commission projected that the metropolitan Seattle area codes (206, 253, and 425) would also soon exhaust their number pools, and expanded the 564 plan to include those areas as well. By the summer, however, this was determined to be not immediately necessary. The NPA was then planned for application on October 20, 2001. On August 22, 2001, the WUTC announced that, due to increased efficiency in the reuse of the existing number pool, the immediate need for the new NPA had subsided. Part of this was also attributed to a downturn in the telecommunications sector. The commission put off implementation until no earlier than October 20, 2002. Since the development of the initial plan for the area code, the WUTC and the NANPA have rebuffed the telephone companies' request for a new NPA and instead directed them to actively share and efficiently use the number blocks already assigned. This mainly refers to the practice of number pooling, or dividing telephone exchanges (aka prefixes) into up to 10 1,000-number blocks, instead of a whole prefix's numbering space being assigned wholesale to one carrier. Due to the 564 overlay, 10-digit dialing was required for all local phone calls in Western Washington starting July 29, 2017. Before that time, local calls within an NPA could use 7-digit dialing. Projected exhaust dates , the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission reported projected exhaust dates for the Washington area codes as follows: 206 exhausted by 2027; 253 exhausted by 2046; 360 exhausted by 2018; 425 exhausted by 2040; and 509 exhausted by 2025.

Location In spite of its relatively modest size, Holmul was important to both the Tikal and the Kaanul (Kan/\\"Snake\\") dynasties. According to archaeologist Francisco Estrada-Belli, Holmul occupied a strategic position for both these kingdoms. Holmul lay along the best east-west route between Tikal and the coast. And it also lay on the north-south route between the Kaanul capital Dzibanche and the Guatemalan Highlands. The latter route did not pass through Tikal territory, and was very important for trade, because of the strategic materials that could be imported from there. Archaeological research The site was first visited by an archaeological research team in 1911, led by Harvard University archaeologist Raymond Merwin. The initial work by Merwin at Holmul (later expanded by George Clapp Vaillant) produced the first stratigraphic ceramic sequence to be defined at a Maya region site. However, the results of this Peabody Museum expedition were not formally published until some twenty years afterwards, and subsequently the site remained relatively little-studied. Excavation and research at Holmul resumed only in the year 2000, as an archaeological group from Boston University, organized by Dr. Francisco Estrada Belli, began to explore the site. Shortly after its start, this archaeological project received funding from Vanderbilt University, until 2008, when Boston University took over the exploration's funding again. History Holmul, as a city, began its existence around 800 BCE and was abandoned by 900 CE at around the time of the Classic Maya collapse. This made the city one of the longest occupied by the Maya. Holmul reached the height of its power at between 750 and 900 and may have had a considerable social influence over the many communities located in the compact area around it. The region likely influenced by Holmul is sometimes referred to as the \\"Holmul Domain\\". One archaeological site located near Holmul, called La Sufricaya, includes painted murals which seem to suggest some degree of foreign involvement in the Holmul Domain. Foreigners in the region may have been from Teotihuacan, or possibly from Tikal. This could have drastic implications for traditional understanding of the relationship between the Maya and the people of Teotihuacan, especially between the years 300-550 CE. In 2013, a building from about 600 CE was found with a large stucco frieze showing a central ruler and two flanking ones in repose. Below the frieze runs a long inscription from which it appears that the construction (which contains a staircase burial) was commissioned by king Ajwosaj of Naranjo, a city on the Holmul River. Naranjo was subordinated to the Kaan(ul/al) dynasty of Dzibanche and Calakmul. The latter kingdom was a main rival to Tikal. Because of Holmul's status as one of the last Mayan cities to be abandoned, archaeologists are interested in walls built around the city during its last years of habitation. Walls also exist around another city in the Holmul Domain, called Cival, and could suggest the possibility of a final siege near the time of the collapse of the two cities, although the real implications of the structures are unknown. Holmul ceramic style Dish with parrot effigy lid, Holmul, Group II, Building B, Early Classic The name of Holmul is also attached to a Late-Classic ceramic art style associated with the wider Holmul- Naranjo region, and characterized by a red and orange palette on a cream background; its predominant theme is that of the so-called 'Holmul dancer', that is, the Tonsured Maize God, shown as a dancer with a ceremonial back rack.

Background In 1861 the citizens of Chincoteague voted 138-2 to remain loyal to the Union, despite Virginia's vote for secession on May 23‚Äîthe island was the only part of Virginia to do so. With little need for slaves because of its poor cropland, Chincoteague's economic survival depended on selling seafood to northern cities. Though loyal to the Union, Chincoteague was surrounded by Confederate sympathizers in Virginia and Maryland. Chincoteague Bay, Sinepuxent Bay, and Pocomoke River all served as routes to Maryland and Delaware which the Confederates were using to smuggle arms north into the two border states. They also had plans to prey on Union shipping entering and leaving Delaware Bay: at the center of these plans was the schooner Venus. On July 4, 1861, 418 men from the barrier islands in Maryland and Virginia met at Chincoteague to celebrate the 85th anniversary of American independence. All who were present signed a draft declaration prepared by Dr. George Schereer which pledged support for the United States against its enemies. Captain Edward Whaley, Sr., a War of 1812 veteran, shouted, \\"I will defend the old flag to my last drop of blood, against the lazy, slave-holding aristocrats and their lackeys in Richmond.\\" On July 5, the declaration, and letters addressed to the commanding officers of the U.S. Navy at Hampton Roads, were dispatched aboard the sloop Jenny Sharpley. The letters detailed the importation of arms through Chincoteague Inlet and up the Pocomoke River to Confederate sympathizers; the islanders also requested the right to ship oysters to northern ports and for protection by the Federal Navy. When Jenny Sharpley arrived at Hampton Roads, the packet was delivered to Flag Officer S. H. Stringham. Stringham ignored the letters, but was enraged that Jenny Sharpley had broken through the Union Blocking Squadron and the islanders had been able to board his ship without being challenged. The Navy subsequently stonewalled the islanders' requests for several months, but Chincoteague remained loyal, despite growing Confederate forces at the county seat, Drummondtown. However, during a September 2 cabinet meeting, President Lincoln was handed a letter by Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase. Addressed to Flag Officer Stringham, it read: United States Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles jumped to his feet: \\"If no action is pending then Stringham will be replaced.\\" General Winfield Scott suggested that the United States Army send several thousand troops immediately for the relief of Chincoteague. On September 19, Captain Louis M. Goldsborough relieved Stringham as flag officer. Battle On the evening of September 28, eight small boats were spotted rowing toward Chincoteague Inlet from the mainland. An alarm bell was rung in front of W.H. Watson and Company warehouse, and 94 armed men from Chincoteague responded, taking up positions along their warehouses and docks. It soon became clear that the boats were not attacking Chincoteague, but marking the channel with lanterns, so two sloops and a large schooner could enter the inlet. By dawn, the three ships had anchored near Cockle Creek and a British flag that had been flying from the schooner, Venus, had been replaced by the Confederate banner. On the afternoon of the 25th, an oyster sloop commanded by Edward Whaley, Jr., and crewed by William Lynch, John Jester, Henry Savage, and Robert Snead set off to Hampton Roads to again warn the Navy. Whaley and crew were escorted in guard boats to the flagship, the steam frigate , and presented to Captain Goldsborough; they then ate with their host in Minnesota's great cabin. Four sailors from Minnesota, armed with rifles and cutlasses, accompanied the men back to Chincoteague with the pledge of immediate aid. On September 30, Navy Lieutenant Commander Alexander Murray arrived off Chincoteague with 90 men in the recently built, propeller-driven, iron-hull steamer, . Meanwhile, Venus had rapidly been converted into a privateer of ten guns: in addition to cannon, 1,000 New England rifles, shot, and three tons of powder had been put aboard. The 135-foot (41-meter) schooner, with her broad beam and shoal draft, would have been ideal to prey on shipping entering or leaving Delaware Bay. However, at 9 a.m. on October 5, two boats from Louisiana were launched and attacked Venus with howitzers. Louisiana herself was then piloted through Chincoteague Inlet and opened fire with her 32-pounder. Next, a Virginian force of 300 cut off the Louisiana's boats, but the Federal crews attacked and boarded Venus. The heavy fire from Louisiana shut down the Virginian defenses, and the Federal boarding party set fire to Venus, which burned to the water line before sinking in Cockle Creek. The two accompanying sloops were captured and taken to Norfolk as prizes of war. On hearing the news, Winfield Scott is said to have ordered Chincoteague oysters and Bermuda onions at Willard's Hotel. In early December, Venus‚Ä≤s rifles and cannon were salvaged from the wreck; her gear is likely still buried in her so-far-undiscovered hull. Aftermath Louisiana remained at Chincoteague until late December. Two days after the battle, she captured the schooner S.T. Carrison with a cargo of wood near Wallops Island. On 14 October Louisiana‚Ä≤s Commander Murray witnessed the administration of the oath of allegiance to the United States to Chincoteague's citizens. Louisiana‚Ä≤s boats, led by Lieutenant Alfred Hopkins, surprised and burned three Confederate vessels at Chincoteague Inlet on October 28 and 29. On December 8, 4,000 Federal troops secured the remainder of the Eastern Shore of Virginia for the Union. Although a minor skirmish, the Battle of Cockle Creek eliminated the Confederate threat to Delaware Bay and strengthened Union control over Maryland's and Virginia's Eastern Shores.

Traditionally occupied for 12 days beginning the last Wednesday of July for prayer and religious instruction, the camp is composed of 47 wood cabins (called \\"tents\\") in an oval around a tabernacle. As with many such meeting grounds, the camp is located in a grove of oak trees. The front-gabled cabins almost touch each other. Each cabin has a window in the gable and a porch on the front. The rear of the porch is entirely open to the interior of the house, so that the cabin's occupants could see and be seen from the center. An enclosed kitchen is in the back of the cabin. Sleeping rooms are located upstairs. Tents are usually owned by families, although a few tents, such as the preacher's, are owned by the camp committee. A boarding tent with six sleeping rooms offers food, and a confectionery is located outside the circle. At the center of the circle is the tabernacle. Originally a long shed, two arms were added to make it cruciform in shape, with three arms used for seating while a fourth serves as a chancel. Hinged panels open to allow a view into the tabernacle from outside. Benches outside accommodate overflow. Carey's Camp was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

Construction, acquisition, and commissioning SS William Isom was built as a commercial tanker in 1917 at Baltimore, Maryland, by the Baltimore Drydock and Shipbuilding Corporation for the Sinclair Gulf Corporation. The United States Shipping Board acquired her from Sinclair Gulf on 24 April 1918 for service in World War I. The U.S. Navy acquired her from the Shipping Board on 1 May 1918, assigned the naval registry Identification Number (Id. No.) 1555, and commissioned as USS William Isom the same day at New York City with Lieutenant Commander Wenzel Habel, USNRF, in command. United States Navy career Initially assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, William Isom had been reassigned to the Fleet Train by 1 July 1918 to serve as a depot tanker. In that role, she carried fuel and supplies to various American ships and stations. She appears never to have seen service overseas, but rather remained close to the shores of the United States throughout her 15 months of naval service. On 21 August 1919, William Isom simultaneously was decommissioned, transferred to the U.S. Shipping Board, and returned to the Sinclair Gulf Corporation . Later career The ship resumed mercantile service with the Sinclair Gulf Corporation as SS William Isom. In 1920, she was sold to the American Italian Commercial Corporation, then in the mid-1920s to the Cuba Distilling Company. In 1930, Edwin B. DeGolia acquired her and in 1931 renamed her SS Edwin B. DeGolia. She served with the Hillcone Steamship Company under that name until late 1947 or early 1948, when the Artemis Maritime Company of Panama acquired her and renamed her SS Demosthenes. She continued in mercantile service with Artemis under the name Demosthenes until late in 1955 or early in 1956. At that point, all mention of her in mercantile lists ceased.

History Before the arrival of Europeans, Cherokees settled the area around the Reedy River. The first white settlements occurred in 1777, and the city of Greenville grew around the river when mills harnessed its power. Evidence of the mills can still be seen along the river today. Furman University built a campus nearby in 1850. Reedy River Falls Preservation In 1907 the first idea of turning Reedy River Falls into a park was introduced. This idea had been ruined when the city began to become industrialized. Industries and even individuals used the river as a dump for waste and trash. The actual pollution hadn't ceased until the 1960s. Furman donated the land needed to set aside to begin Reedy River Falls Historic Park and Greenway. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The development of Falls Park began in the 1990s when a developer proposed the concept of turning the park into a regional attraction. The development of the park began with a budget of 13,000,000 and was funded through the City of Greenville Hospitality Tax. Description of Falls Park Falls Park is located right in the center of Greenville County. This area has become known as Downtown Greenville and is a huge attraction with its citizens. The area today is filled with thousands of stores and restaurants. The park now includes a bridge known as Liberty Bridge and brings together many different types of greenery and benches, and different trails throughout the park.

Written on the game board, it says \\"If you manage to see off six Jews, you‚Äôve won a clear victory!\\" Juden Raus is a commercial boardgame rather than a Nazi propaganda effort, and contains no Nazi symbolism. The game was criticised by the SS journal Das Schwarze Korps, which believed the game trivialised anti-Semitic policies. Ben Barkow of the Holocaust museum at the Wiener Library recounts it being documented as a \\"considerable commercial success\\", with possibly a million copies of it being sold. However, an article in the Board Game Studies Journal suggests that the game's commercial performance may never actually be known because it may have been exaggerated in advertising material. The article considers it unlikely that the game could have been successful in Germany after having been condemned by the SS. The article published by the International Board Game Studies Association calls it \\"history's most infamous board game\\". The review says, \\"Juden Raus! shows that after decades of propaganda, anti-Semitism was so deeply rooted in German society in the 1930s, that someone thought it would be a good subject for a children‚Äôs game. Racism is present in many board games, but Juden Raus! is unique in its portrayal of how racism manifests itself in society and is a terrifying example of the banality of evil. ... There are many areas of the world where such a game might still find a receptive audience. ... Juden Raus! is a warning to us all\\". = Bomber √ºber England (1940) = Bomber √ºber England (lit. \\"Bombers over England\\") is a bagatelle (or pinball) style game featuring a map of England and part of Northern Europe. The map contains holes in the location of key cities such as London, Liverpool, Newcastle, and Plymouth as well as various points representing targets in the North Sea. Players shoot spring-driven balls representing \\"bombs\\" at these targets and are awarded various points for hitting the enemy targets. If players bomb locations under the control of Nazi Germany such as Brussels and Amsterdam, they lose points. = Jagd auf Kohlenklau (1944) = Jagd auf Kohlenklau (lit. \\"Hunting for the Coal Thief\\") is a roll-and-move board game which was produced by Lepthian-Schiffers in Nazi Germany during the latter years of World War II. The game was part of a Nazi propaganda campaign that was launched on June 23, 1942, under the slogan \\"Kampf dem Kohlenklau\\" or \\"fight the coal thief\\".Kohlenklau (GERMAN) This campaign sought to promote energy conservation as a means to save the country's dwindling resources for the war effort. The visual representation of the Kohlenklau, or \\"coal thief,\\" became an iconic image of Nazi Germany and was often featured in newspapers, magazines, posters, and films. Four million copies of Jagd auf Kohlenklau were produced and distributed among the households with the most children. The game board consists of 50 spaces, red, black and white. The players roll a die and advance their game piece that many spaces. When the player lands on a space, they read aloud a corresponding text passage from the board. Red spaces represent energy wasting actions that penalise players, e.g. \\"..leaves the radio on when nobody is listening. The coal thief likes that! (miss a turn)\\". Black spaces feature actions that conserve energy and reward the players. White spaces are neutral and have no effect. Players take turns until one finally reaches the end and is declared the winner. The winner discovers who the \\"coal thief\\" was and successfully evicts them from the house.

Life and business career  Ralph Thompson was born in Poughkeepsie, NY, to a Jamaican mother and US father, but the marriage lasted only three years, and from 1931 Thompson and his sister were raised in Jamaica. His mother's family, \\"a mixture of crypto Jewish (Isaacs) and Irish stock (Fielding)\\", was \\"staunchly Catholic and claimed to be white\\".\\"About the author\\", in Ralph Thompson, View from Mount Diablo (Leeds: Peepal Tree Press, 2003), p. 56. He was educated by Jesuits both at St George's College in Kingston and at Fordham University in New York, where he earned a Doctor of Law degree in 1952. After graduation he served for two years as an officer in the United States Air Force, principally in Japan, but returned to Jamaica in 1953, married a Jamaican, Doreen Lyons, in 1954, and has since lived in Kingston with his wife and children save for a brief period in the 1970s. Thompson's business career was initially in property development with Abe Issa, the \\"father of Jamaican tourism\\", then independently. After his return to Jamaica he was deeply involved in governmental redevelopment of agriculture, and in 1988 was appointed a Commander of Distinction by the administration of Edward Seaga. His last major post was as CEO of Seprod Ltd, a large Jamaican manufacturing firm supplying household products and consumer goods for the local market. Thompson is also a noted educational activist, speaking on radio and TV, and frequently writing for The Gleaner and The Jamaica Observer. He is also an amateur painter, and has publicly exhibited several times in Kingston; a selection of his paintings was published by Peepal Tree Press in 2008.Jacqueline Bishop (ed.), Writers Who Paint / Painters Who Write: Three Jamaican Artists (Leeds: Peepal Tree Press, 2007), pp. 32‚Äì45.  Poetry  During his residence in Florida in the late 1970s Thompson took a Masters in English Literature at the University of South Florida, submitted some poems as part of an assignment, and was encouraged to publish them. He began to write poetry more intensively, and in 1987 Alan Ross accepted \\"Florida\\" for the London Magazine. Thompson has subsequently published more than 20 poems in British, US, and Caribbean journals, including The Caribbean Writer and Mississippi Review. His work is represented in The Heinemann Book of Caribbean Poetry (1992), A World of Poetry for CXC (1994), several Observer Arts Magazine anthologies, The Oxford Book of Caribbean Verse (2005), and Writers Who Paint / Painters Who Write (2007).

Palm Beach County Canvassing Board, 531 U.S. 70 (2000), was a United States Supreme Court decision involving Florida voters during the 2000 presidential election. In this case, the U.S. Supreme Court requested clarification from the Florida Supreme Court regarding a decision it had made. Shortly after the Florida Supreme Court provided those clarifications, the U.S. Supreme Court resolved the election in favor of George W. Bush over Al Gore in the case of Bush v. Gore. Background The 2000 presidential election was contingent upon who won the popular vote in Florida. Republican George W. Bush was narrowly ahead in the tally. Democrat Al Gore challenged the decision of Katherine Harris, Florida's Secretary of State, to certify Bush as the winner on November 14 (a deadline established by Florida statute). Gore asserted that Harris had disregarded manual recount results in four Florida counties. The Florida Supreme Court responded to Gore's challenge by holding that Harris had to wait until November 26 to certify the winner, and that she must include the manual recount results. Bush then appealed the Florida Supreme Court decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. Issues before U.S. Supreme Court The Court was faced with two questions. First, did post- election court decisions in Florida violate the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution or ? Second, did the Florida Supreme Court violate Article II of the United States Constitution, which confers plenary power in federal election matters on state legislatures, when the Florida Supreme Court allegedly changed the manner in which Florida's electoral votes were chosen? Holding The Court unanimously held that there was \\"considerable uncertainty\\" as to the reasons for the Florida Supreme Court's decision. Therefore, the Court declined to review the questions presented, instead vacating the Florida Supreme Court decision and remanding the case for clarification of two questions. First, to what extent did the Florida Supreme Court see the Florida Constitution as circumscribing the legislature's authority under Article II of the federal Constitution? Second, how much consideration did the Florida Supreme Court give to a relevant federal statute, namely 3 U.S.C. ¬ß 5? See also * Bush v.

The Chipman House was built in 1913 by Joseph and Ernest Chipman on their property with the assistance of Alva Hudson. The 2¬Ω story balloon-framed house was furnished with sparse, shuttered windows and slatted floors, allowing adjustment of air circulation.

Windows were once glazed beneath the shutters, a very unusual feature in a potato house. The internal structure used samson posts, a kind of capped column that is normally employed in mill construction to bear heavy loads, leading to speculation that the feature echos construction in the adjacent, now destroyed Chipman's Mill.

It was first released in 2006 and is distributed by Radiotelevisione Italiana and RaiTrade. Plot In part one, Don Pietro (Flavio Insinna) gives refuge from the Nazis to Lidia (Ana Caterina Morariu) and Mario (Paolo Briguglia). We meet Teresa (Paola Tiziana Cruciani), Don Pietro's no-nonsense housekeeper; Gioacchino (Ignazio Oliva), a professor, former pupil, and good friend of Don Pietro's; and Oscar (Max Mazzotta), a transient visitor. Don Pietro accompanies a Jewish physician and young mother to San Paolo, a safe haven from the regime. In part two, Lidia and Mario fall in love and plan to get married. Oscar betrays Don Pietro. The Nazi SS storm the refuge and arrest Don Pietro and friends. Don Pietro and Gioacchino are among the 335 men executed at the Ardeatine Caves. The overall message of this film is that Don Pietro could have fled to San Paolo when he had the chance, but, like St. Peter, he came back to help any more people from being deported to the Nazi concentration camps. And like Judas betraying Jesus, Oscar betrayed Don Pietro by telling the Nazis where he lived. But Oscar got his rightful punishment when Gioacchino's men found him and threw him off a second floor balcony.

The company's specialty and only currently-produced vehicle is the S3 Roadster, a kit-car copy of the Lotus Super 7. The founder and owner of the company is John Watson, a descendant of pioneering race car driver Tim Birkin. Birkin Cars was formed in 1982. Founder John Watson, an automotive enthusiast, was a fan of the classic Lotus Seven. However, the car had since finished production from the manufacturer and could no longer be purchased as new. Through the early 1980s, Watson developed and built his own version of the Seven. The cars were unveiled to the public at the 1983 South African Grand Prix. The first shipment of completed S3 Roadsters were delivered directly to be sold at Lotus car dealerships.Birkin History at Xmission.com Since the 1980s, Birkin has expanded several times, but has kept its base of operations near Durban in KwaZulu-Natal. Cars are currently sold through dealers around the world in the United States, Japan, and across Europe. The car can be purchased as either a turn-key car, or as a DIY kit, that can be completed by the owner. Several inline 4 cylinder engines, such as the Ford ZetecZetec-Powered Birkin Road test at Kit Car Magazine and Toyota 4AG can be used in the vehicle. Further developments to the car include using an independent rear suspension as opposed to the previously used live axle. As of July 2013 Birkin has added a wide body version, this car is approximately 4\\" wider and 3\\" longer.

The story highlighted differences between two facilities in Rutherford County, Tennessee. One inmate had been released from a facility to participate in a rehabilitation program, but was asked to return after authorities discovered she still had time to serve on her sentence, as calculated by that facility. Bell discovered the Rutherford County Correctional Work Center had been using a formula to calculate the length of inmates' sentences which was different from the 2-for-1 'Good Time' credit that is prescribed by Tennessee law. 'Inmates work in scrutiny' Bell won the Malcolm Law award in 2012 for a series of stories dealing with Rutherford County, Tennessee inmates working on a private horse farm without a valid contract, which was in violation of state law governing such labor on private property. Bell uncovered that inmates from the jail were cleaning up storm debris and repairing fences at the private farm, where the Rutherford County Sheriff's Office mounted patrol division boarded and trained its horses. The lease agreement allowing the sheriff's office to use the stables and property had been expired for more than a year when Bell broke the story in May 2011. The following day, inmate work there was suspended. It resumed several months later when the county drew up a new lease agreement with the stables owner, which allowed the sheriff's office mounted patrol and inmates to access and work on the property for $200 per month. Also uncovered in the series of stories was that a now-former sheriff had signed a contract with the stables owner without going to the Rutherford County Board of Commissioners for approval. Fatal accident investigation Bell first won the Malcolm Law award in 2009 for a series of investigative articles stemming from a July 17, 2008 fatal crash, which involved an 11-year-old Hopkinsville, Kentucky girl and a now-former sheriff's detective. The crash occurred on Bradyville Pike in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Bell reported eyewitness accounts that the detective dumped bottles containing alcohol from his cruiser after the crash and that investigators initially ignored those accounts and failed to collect the bottles at the scene.Mark Bell. \\"Deputy hits, kills girl.\\" The Daily News Journal Murfreesboro, TN. 19 July 2008.

Karen Maeda and Amanda Tarbet of Sequential Tart, Comic Book Bin's Leroy Douresseaux, Mania's Patricia Beard, Comic Book Resources's Michelle Smith, and Pop Culture Shock's Sam Kusek said its art to be confusing. On the contrary, Active Anime's Holly Ellingwood, ICv2's Steve Bennett, Anime News Network's Carlo Santos, and a Publishers Weeklys reviewer praised its art; it was said to be imaginative, and its character designs \\"full of unorthodox curves and lines ... look unlike anything else in the genre\\", according to Santos. Beard, Kusek and Tarbet criticized the story; the former qualified it as \\"poorly elaborated\\", and the latter two found the story lacked explanations about the plot. On the other hand, Ellingwood stated it is \\"an enthralling story\\" because there are mysteries to be discovered. Smith praised how the plot was elucidated a bit in the second volume, but still thought it was \\"convoluted\\" as in the first one. Douresseaux described that in the second volume \\"the narrative runs a lot smoother, unencumbered\\" and Fujisaki's art was \\"a lot of clearer\\". Douresseaux, Beard, Bennett, Santos and Kusek described it as having elements from a typical sh≈çnen series. Conversely, Douresseaux stated \\"The eccentric narrative and the eclectic art makes the four-volume WƒÅqwƒÅq unique graphical storytelling\\", while Ellingwood declared \\"The originality and creativity in the story and the art work make it a stand out from the norm in manga.\\" Regarding its characters, Maeda praised the variety, while Tarbet praised their \\"not only believable but realistic\\" motivations. Beard said the series has \\"memorable\\" characters, comparing Shio's personality to Gon Freecss from Hunter √ó Hunter. Zaki Zakaria of The Star commented that \\"the chemistry between Shio and Matsuda, despite requiring more work, is charming.\\" On the other hand, Kusek asserted \\"I don't really think Shio is that strong of a lead\\", and Bennet criticized the non-development of the characters' relationships. Smith highlighted its post-apocalyptic setting as a reason to continue reading, but Douresseaux affirmed, \\"It's also a typical post- apocalyptic sci-fi series with the Mad Max-type violence watered down for young readers.\\" Tarbet wrote that its mithology is the most appealing characteristic of the series and praised the battle scenes involving other characters than Shio. The action was also praised by Publishers Weekly, Ellingwood, Maeda, Santos, and Zakaria, who said \\"They are mandala-like battles of gorgeously drawn mechs straight out of the game Zone of the Enders, and of Gurren Lagann heights of crazy.\\" Santos said it \\"does the remarkable\\" as reach \\"an epic finale\\" in only four volumes.
