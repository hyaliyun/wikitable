Much of his research is focused on the reptiles and amphibians of Madagascar. Life Vences attended the Schiller-Gymnasium K√∂ln from 1979 to 1988, and graduated with the German Abitur. The following year he began to study Biology at the University of Cologne. There he met Frank Glaw, and as undergraduate students they undertook their first excursions to Madagascar. 496 pp. After completing the Vordiplom in 1993, Vences transferred to the University of Bonn and the Museum K√∂nig, where he completed his Diplom studies. Vences continued his studies there as a PhD student under the supervision of Wolfgang B√∂hme until 2000. His thesis was on the evolutionary history of true frogs (Ranoidea) and related families in Madagascar. Thereafter, he worked for one year at the National Museum of Natural History of France in Paris, before returning to Germany in 2001 to work at the University of Konstanz. In 2002 he worked at the University of Amsterdam and the Zoological Museum of Amsterdam as assistant professor and Leader of the Vertebrate section. In 2005 he moved to the Braunschweig University of Technology as a professor of evolutionary biology, where he works to this day. In 2013 he was elected into the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities, and in 2018 to the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina (the German National Academy of Sciences). Scientific work Glaw is Brookesia micra, one of the smallest reptile species.alt=Juvenile of Brookesia micra on the head of a match The focus of Vences' work is on the amphibians and reptiles of Madagascar. He works together with Frank Glaw on many taxonomic species descriptions; together they have described over 200 new species of frogs, and numerous new species of snakes, chameleons, and other reptiles. In 1992, they produced a field guide to the reptiles and amphibians of Madagascar. In 1994 they produced a second edition of this guide, including the descriptions of numerous new taxa, and a significantly expanded reptile section. In 2007, a third edition was produced, which did not describe any new species, but included colour photographs and short text descriptions of over 100 unnamed species. In recent years, Vences has been coauthor on several publications over a wide range of subjects, including but not limited to biogeography, amphibian disease and amphibian-associated microbiomes, population genetics, evolution and speciation, and taxonomy.

History Proponents, often including police unions and associations, say the spit hoods can help protect personnel from exposure to serious infections like hepatitis and that in London, 59% of injecting drug users test positive for hepatitis C. According to The New York Times, spit hoods have been involved in several deaths in law enforcement custody, where people died after saying, \\"I can't breathe.\\" Several studies have concluded that the risk of transmission of disease from spitting was low. According to OSHA regulations saliva is considered potentially infectious for hepatitis C, HIV and other bloodbpurne pathogens only if visible blood is present. The spit hoods have been criticised for breaching human rights guidelines. Critics describe the hoods as primitive, cruel, and degrading. Some British police chiefs have privately expressed concerns that the hoods are reminiscent of those used at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. A decision by the Metropolitan Police Service in London to start using spit hoods was condemned by the human rights group Amnesty International, the civil rights group Liberty and the campaign group Inquest. Many major British police forces have chosen to outlaw spit hoods. The use of spit hoods and restraint chairs at the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre in the Northern Territory, Australia lead to the establishment of the Royal Commission into the Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory.

Engineering Analysis with Boundary Elements. in order to further improve the computational efficiency of meshfree methods in numerical analysis. Local meshfree methods are derived through a weighted-residual formulation which leads to a local weak form that is the well known work theorem of the theory of structures. In an arbitrary local region, the work theorem establishes an energy relationship between a statically-admissible stress field and an independent kinematically- admissible strain field. Based on the independence of these two fields, this formulation results in a local form of the work theorem that is reduced to regular boundary terms only, integration-free and free of volumetric locking. Advantages over finite element methods are that GSMF doesn't rely on a grid, and is more precise and faster when solving bi-dimensional problems.

Formulation In the local form of the work theorem, equation: : \\\\int_{\\\\Gamma_Q} \\\\mathbf{t}^T \\\\mathbf{u}^{*} d\\\\Gamma + \\\\int_{\\\\Omega_Q} \\\\mathbf{b}^{T} \\\\mathbf{u}^{*} d\\\\Omega = \\\\int_{\\\\Omega_Q} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}^T \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}^{*} d\\\\Omega. The displacement field \\\\mathbf{u}^{*}, was assumed as a continuous function leading to a regular integrable function that is the kinematically-admissible strain field \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}^{*}. However, this continuity assumption on \\\\mathbf{u}^{*}, enforced in the local form of the work theorem, is not absolutely required but can be relaxed by convenience, provided \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}^{*} can be useful as a generalized function, in the sense of the theory of distributions, see Gelfand and Shilov.Gelfand, I.M., Shilov, G.E. (1964). Generalized Functions. Volume I, Academic Press, New York. Hence, this formulation considers that the displacement field \\\\mathbf{u}^{*}, is a piecewise continuous function, defined in terms of the Heaviside step function and therefore the corresponding strain field \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\varepsilon}^{*}, is a generalized function defined in terms of the Dirac delta function. For the sake of the simplicity, in dealing with Heaviside and Dirac delta functions in a two-dimensional coordinate space, consider a scalar function d, defined as: : d = \\\\lVert\\\\ \\\\mathbf{x}-\\\\mathbf{x}_Q \\\\rVert which represents the absolute-value function of the distance between a field point \\\\mathbf{x} and a particular reference point \\\\mathbf{x}_Q, in the local domain \\\\Omega_Q \\\\cup \\\\Gamma_Q assigned to the field node Q. Therefore, this definition always assumes d=d(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{x}_Q) \\\\geq 0, as a positive or null value, in this case whenever \\\\mathbf{x} and \\\\mathbf{x}_Q are coincident points. For a scalar coordinate d\\\\supset d(\\\\mathbf{x},\\\\mathbf{x}_Q), the Heaviside step function can be defined as : H(d) = 1 \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, if \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, d\\\\leq 0 \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, (d=0 \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, for \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\equiv \\\\mathbf{x}_Q) : H(d) = 0 \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, if \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, d > 0 \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, (\\\\mathbf{x} eq \\\\mathbf{x}_Q) in which the discontinuity is assumed at \\\\mathbf{x}_Q and consequently, the Dirac delta function is defined with the following properties : \\\\delta(d) = H'(d) = \\\\infty \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, if \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, d=0 \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, that \\\\,\\\\, is \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\equiv \\\\mathbf{x}_Q : \\\\delta(d) = H'(d) = 0 \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, if \\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\,\\\\, d eq 0 \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, (d>0 \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, for \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\mathbf{x} eq \\\\mathbf{x}_Q) and : \\\\int\\\\limits_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty} \\\\delta(d)\\\\,d d=1 in which H'(d) represents the distributional derivative of H(d).

This is the equation used in the Generalized-Strain Mesh- Free (GSMF) formulation which, therefore, is free of integration. Since the work theorem is a weighted-residual weak form, it can be easily seen that this integration-free formulation is nothing else other than a weighted-residual weak-form collocation. The weighted-residual weak-form collocation readily overcomes the well-known difficulties posed by the weighted-residual strong- form collocation,Kansa, E.J.,(1990) \\"Multiquadrics: A Scattered Data Approximation Scheme with Applications to Computational Fluid Dynamics\\", Computers and Mathematics with Applications, 19(8-9), 127--145. regarding accuracy and stability of the solution.

It protects an area of Atlantic Forest. The area has been badly degraded in some areas by human activity before the park was created, but efforts are being made to restore the former ecology. Location The Montanhas de Teres√≥polis Municipal Nature Park is in the northwest part of the municipality of Teres√≥polis, adjoining the municipalities of Petr√≥polis and S√£o Jos√© do Vale do Rio Preto. With an area of , it is the largest fully protected municipal conservation unit in the state of Rio de Janeiro. It is in the hydrological basin of the Piabanha, Preto and Paquequer rivers. The park contains an imposing mountain range that contains large rocky outcrops such as the Tartaruga, Camelo and Santana. The park is used by students of the municipality's Alpine Farming School for environmental education projects in a partnership between the environment and education departments. The park adjoins the Serra dos √ìrg√£os National Park at the Caleme Dam. History The Montanhas de Teres√≥polis Municipal Nature Park was created by municipal decree 3.693 of 6 June 2009. The objectives are to preserve natural ecosystems of great ecological importance and scenic beauty, enabling scientific research and education, recreation in contact with nature and eco-tourism. The park was included in the Central Rio de Janeiro Atlantic Forest Mosaic, which had been created in December 2006. As of 2016 the park did not have a management plan. Environment The park protects many springs and important remnants of Atlantic Forest. An ecological survey identified 121 bird species, 31 mammals, including some endangered species, 19 reptiles, 10 amphibians and 8 groups of insects. Much damage was done to the ecology in the past, but it is slowly recovering. Extraction of minerals was common, but is now prohibited, and the traces of quarrying are being covered by vegetation. A partnership between the park and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro is to plant seedlings of native Atlantic Forest trees in the most degraded areas. Hunting and trapping of birds has been almost eliminated with the help of the people living around the conservation unit. Headquarters The Santa Rita center contains a settlement founded by the Swiss zoologist √âmil Goeldi in 1891. It was expropriated by the Instituto Nacional de Coloniza√ß√£o e Reforma Agr√°ria (INCRA: National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform) in 1990 and made into a rural settlement project with about 100 plots. It contains the park headquarters, accommodation, a leisure area and an interpretive trail. The region was hit by the massive storm of January 2011. The headquarters of the park occupy an area of that was purchased by the municipality in late 2012. Damage to the area from the January 2011 storm had been repaired by 2014. The headquarters include the administrative center, an auditorium, library and areas for research work and permanent exhibitions. Another building to accommodate visitors was planned in 2013. Other centers For administrative purposes there are two other distinct centers. The Pedra da Tartaruga (Turtle Rock) center contains the rock mass including the Tartaruga, Camelo and Arrieiro rocks. It has easy trails, a camping area, clean water and toilets. It is used for sports such as hiking, climbing and abseiling.

Mano Bouzamour (born 1991 in Amsterdam) is a Dutch novelist and columnist. He scored a stunning success with his first novel, De belofte van Pisa (The Promise of Pisa), in which he described his childhood and youth as the son of immigrants in the Netherlands.  Life and work  Bouzamour grew up in an immigrant family in the Amsterdam neighborhood of De Pijp. His parents originate from Morocco. He has three sisters and three brothers. His high school was the Reformed Lyceum South. In 2013, when his first novel was published, he worked in a sushi bar and lived together with his girlfriend and his older brother. He intended to study history and continue writing. His literary idoles are American writers such as J.D. Salinger, Stephen King and David Benioff. He admitted that he stole The Catcher in the Rye by Salinger from a Dutch library.Ally Smid: 'Ik ben niet de zoon die mijn vader wil dat ik ben' (I am not the son my father wants me to be), Trouw, 22 december 2013 (Dutch) In 2013, he debuted with his novel The Promise of Pisa. The novel is based on how Bouzamour himself as a teenager grew up in an immigrant neighborhood surrounding De Pijp. In the book, he describes his illiterate and narrow-minded parents, being beaten in the Koran school, hanging around in youth clubs and visiting luxurious homes of classmates. In the morning the protagonist Samir played classical music on a stolen concert piano, and on Fridays, during prayers in the mosque, he struggled with fantasies of blonde and nude female devils, but his happiest hours were at night roaring through Amsterdam with his beloved brother on the Vespa. While his brother had to serve a six-year-sentence for fraud and theft Sam promised and provided ‚Äî against all odds ‚Äî the degree of an elite high school. The book caused an outcry within the Moroccan community as it was not conceived as fiction, but as autobiography. The author was confronted with hatred and, as he called it, ‚Ä≥mass hysteria‚Ä≥, even from relatives and friends. But the Dutch public and the international press loved the book, it became the best-selling debut novel of 2014 in the Netherlands. The film, theater and radio play rights were sold, and publications in the German language and in Latin America were prepared. Bouzamour defended his novel fiercely: \\"Why should my protagonist not be allowed to make jokes about the sweaty feet of his mother?\\" The book is now on the reading list of a some secondary schools. In 2016, the book was published by the prestigious Residenz Verlag in Austria ‚Äî with the German title Samir, genannt Sam (Samir, called Sam). Also was published by the independent publisher house Rey Naranjo in Spanish. In October 2019, the film adaptation of the book premiered: The Promise of Pisa.

He is the current world record holder in the amount of time taken to summit all of the Seven Summits consecutively, having also previously held the same record. He was also the first person to solo summit several of the world's tallest peaks. Tejas was named one of the top fifty Alaskan athletes of the twentieth century by Sports Illustrated in 2002. In 2012, he was elected to the Alaska Sports Hall of Fame. Tejas plays the harmonica and guitar. He currently resides in Greenwich Village, New York. Life and times Vernon Tejas was born on 16 March 1953 at Portland, Oregon, the son of Phillip Sand Hansel and Janice Elaine Hansel. Tejas was born Vernon Edward Hansel and later changed his name to Vernon Tejas. Career From Oregon, Tejas headed north and ended up in Alaska. He went to work on The Alaska Pipeline and for Alaska Telecom, and enjoyed tower work where he built and maintained communication towers on North Slope in Alaska. He is now with Alpine Ascents International as a senior international high altitude alpine mountain guide.Schmuland, Arlene, Damron, Marty, and Sinnott, Jeffrey. (2010).

Hunter from the northwest (Kahilta Base Camp) Tejas became a mountain guide and mountain rescuer operating in the Andes, Himalayas, the Alaska Range, and Antarctica during the 1980s. In 1980, he was part of the team that summited Mount Hunter in the winter season for the first time. The team consisted of Gary Bocarde, Paul Denkewalter, Vernon Tejas. The ascent began on Kahiltna Glacier. Their climb was via the Northwest Spur. The Northwest Spur is also known as the Lowe-Kennedy Route, after Michael Kennedy and George Lowe made the ascent with this route in 1977. The team took their supplies to the base of Triangle Face, which was located a few thousand feet above their base camp and established an advanced camp. They climbed the Triangle Face and headed for Mushroom Ridge. Next the team climbed and reached the summit of Mount Hunter.Bocarde, Gary. (1981). Winter Madness and Joy‚ÄîMount Hunter in Winter.

Anchorage, Alaska. In the autumn of 1982, Tejas broke his ankle while rock climbing in Yosemite. The doctors had to wait a week for the swelling to subside before setting the fracture with a cast. The stress the ankle was subjected to over the years took its toll. The pursuits of a mountaineer and a high altitude alpine mountain guide had destroyed the cartilage in between the subtalar joint. In 2010, S. Robert Rozbruch, M.D. of the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City utilized the Ilizarov technique and injected stem cells into the fixated subtalar joint to stimulate the growth of cartilage.

Around this time he also made several summits of Mount Aconcagua, two of which led to descents to the base camp via a mountain bike, and then a paraglider, both of which he took to the peak himself along the climb. In 1988 he became the first person to paraglide from the Vinson Massif in Antarctica, and later became the first man to solo ascend the mountain. He has also paraglided from the summit of Mount Elbrus. In 1988, Tejas became the first person to successfully solo climb Mount McKinley (now named Mount Denali), during the winter season.Foster, David. (22 May 1988). Solo Trek to Top of Mt.

In order to prevent becoming lost on the climb, he used an aluminum ladder as a part of his safety equipment, so that he would not fall into a crevasse.

In 1992, Tejas was part of the team that measured the exact height of Mount Everest, and was the team member that planted the prism pole at the top of the mountain so that lasers could be used to measure the exact altitude. On 12 May 1992, Tejas, Todd Burleson and Peter Athans placed laser prisms from Bradford Washburn on the summit of Mount Everest as part of a study to determine the height.Angus- Leppan, P. V. (1982).

The American Alpine Journal. 44(76): 286. In 2001, a nine-person team on the Return To The Top Of The World Expedition (RTOW2001) landed at Frigg Fjord. The group traversed the peninsula to the north, and made their way up the Syd Glacier, then crossed the Polkorridoren, and proceeded down the Nord Glacier. As the team crossed, five climbers: John Jancik, Joe Sears, Vernon Tejas, Ken Zerbst, and Steve Gardiner made the second ascent of Helvetia Tinde on 17 July 2001 via a new route up the east ridge. In 1969, the British Joint Services Expedition first climbed the 1920 meter summit of Helvetia Tinde. Helvetia Tinde is the highest peak in the most northerly mountain range on Earth, a mere 750 km from the geographic North Pole. On 18 July 2001, all nine team members: David Baker, Terri Baker, John Jancik, Jim McCrain, Jim Schaefer, Joe Sears, Vernon Tejas, Ken Zerbst, and Steve Gardiner made the first ascent of the highest as yet not climbed peak in the norther most mountain range on Earth. On reaching the north coast, the team recorded altitudes of summits, altitudes of saddles, and GPS readings for 14 peaks. On 23 July 2001, a team crossed the sea ice at Sands Fjord to make first ascents of several peaks on Cape Christian IV. On 25 July 2001, Sears, Tejas, and Gardiner climbed additional peaks in the area that included Peak 6.

Grant is a Canadian trucking magnate and standardbred horse owner from Milton, Ontario. He is the former owner of the Milton Icehawks (previously known as the Milton Merchants), which is part of the Ontario Junior Hockey League. Early life Grant was born in 1954 or 1955 to Kathleen \\"Kay\\" and John Grant, owner of J.B. Grant Trucking, a company that hauled cement in Ontario. Brad has four sisters and one brother. Grant's roots in harness racing stretch back to his childhood. He spent a lot of time on his father's standardbred breeding farm in Hornby, which he purchased in 1965. John Grant, who was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame as a builder in 1998, bred and raced a notable list of provincial stars including Hornby Glory, Hornby Tora, Hornby Judy, Armbro Luxury, and Classic Wish. Brad opted not to continue his father's Hornby breeding operation. The elder John was not only involved in the trucking business, but also the golf course business as well as horse racing. Trucking Ownership Grant founded his trucking company, Active Transport, in 1983. His father owned and operated John Grant Haulage, but it is now a family-owned business that is run by Brad. John Grant Haulage has 57 trucks in operation. In 2015, Brad Grant's investment firm purchased a controlling interest in Hutton Transport from St. Marys Cement. Bradley J. Grant Investments also have financial interests in \\"a number of working transport companies,\\" including Active Transport and Movin' Freight. Hockey Team Ownership Brad Grant purchased the Tier-II Jr. A hockey team, the Milton Steamers in April 1986 around the time the organization was speculated to fold. During the 1986-87 season, he changed the team's name from the Steamers to the Merchants, and brought in former coach Gerry Inglis. Inglis had prior experience coaching the Georgetown Raiders and had won five intermediate championships at the time. Grant led the team to tremendous success in the late 1990s. During his 15-year ownership run, the team captured four division crowns, three league championships and a provincial title. In 1992, the Milton Merchants were Central Junior B Hockey League champions with a 4-2 victory in Game 7 over the Aurora Eagles. They made the Ontario Hockey Association Sutherland Cup Junior B championship, but lost five games to the Mid-Western Junior B Hockey League's Kitchener Dutchmen. The 1994-95 season marked the beginning of a historical run for the franchise as the club won five straight division titles. The surge of success increased when the Merchants were crowned league champions in 1997, winning the Buckland Trophy after defeating the Newmarket 87's. In the 1997 Dudley Cup playoffs, the Rayside-Balfour Sabrecats (NOJHL) beat Milton four games to one. In 1998, the Milton Merchants repeated their Buckland Trophy title, dispatching the Newmarket Hurricanes this time, and then went on to become Central Canadian Junior A Champions by winning the Dudley Hewitt Cup, defeating the Rayside-Balfour Sabrecats (NOJHL) four games to two, and exacting revenge for the previous year's loss to Rayside-Balfour. At the 1998 Royal Bank Cup, the Milton Merchants went 1-3 in round robin play. In the semifinal game, Milton lost 6-2 to the South Surrey Eagles and were eliminated from the tournament. In 2001, Grant sold the team to a trio that consisted of ex-NHLer Dave Gagner, then-owner of the Mississauga IceDogs Mario Forgione, and wine distillery consultant Ken Chase. Harness Racing In the 1970s, Charles Juravinski tried to get a new racetrack off the ground just outside Hamilton, Ontario. Juravinski was introduced to John Grant, Brad's father, who joined in on the venture. With the help of John Grant, Juravinski succeeded in founding his new racetrack in 1971. The half-mile harness horse racing track was named Flamboro Downs. Flamboro Downs proved to be a wise move for Grant as the Hamilton-area racetrack was extremely well received after opening in April 1975. During the first year of opening, Juravinski got to know John Grant's son, Brad. Years later John Grant sold his stake in Flamboro Downs due to health concerns, much to Juravinski's dismay. Many years later Juravinski and the younger Grant joined forces to co-own a horse named American Rock. In 1997, Brad Grant got drawn back into the horse racing industry through the ownership of horses. On January 4, 2016, a devastating barn fire at Classy Lane Training Centre in Puslinch, Ontario killed 43 horses. Grant himself lost four of his horses in the fire ‚Äî millionaire older pacer Apprentice Hanover, unraced three-year-old pacing mare Proven Effective, older gelded pacer Whiskey N Pie (a winner of $47,000 on the track) and older gelded pacer Whistle Jimmy K, who earned more than $47,000 racing. Two weeks later, Grant traveled to New Jersey where he spent $275,000 USD on three racehorses to be trained by Guelph native Ben Wallace, who had lost all 17 horses of his horses due to the Classy Lane fire. Personal Grant serves the Milton District Hospital Foundation as vice chair and is a past chair of the foundation. He has donated thousands of dollars to the hospital foundation through his personal donations as well as donations from his trucking companies. He is also the finance chairman of the Ontario Hockey Association. Grant lives in Milton, Ontario. He is married to his wife Bonnie.

Masses of bodies, particularly humans, are the subjects of these crowd tracking analyses that include how a particular crowd moves and when a movement pattern changes.Gamma, \\"Data-driven Crowd Simulation and Crowd Tracking\\", UNC at Chapel Hill, 2015 Researchers use the data to predict future crowd movement, crowd density, and plan responses to potential events such as those that require evacuation routes.Jacques, Julio, \\"Crowd Analysis Using Computer Vision Techniques\\", \\"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine\\", September 2010 Applications of crowd analysis can range from video game crowd simulation to security and surveillance.  Background  Due to population growth, crowd analysis has become a major interest in social and technical disciplines. People use crowd analysis to develop crowd management strategies in public events as well as public space design, visual surveillance, and virtual environments. Goals include to make areas more convenient, and prevent crowd induced disasters. Some crowds cannot be analyzed as easily as others. The psychology of a crowd impacts how it is broken up and studied. Crowds can be casual, such as a group of pedestrian walking down the road, or causal, like people participating in a marathon or protest. They can be as active an erratic as a mob or as passive as an audience. While the main crowd is the subject of the bulk of the analysis, anomalies must be taken into account, like someone opposing the flow of traffic or a biker travelling through a group of walkers. Hence, the purpose of a group of individuals determines the interpretation of the data obtained. Significant research has been done to understand the way crowds moves in order to predict where areas of conflicts may occur.M. Butenuth et al., \\"Integrating pedestrian simulation, tracking and event detection for crowd analysis,\\" 2011 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCV Workshops), Barcelona, 2011, pp. 150-157. Web. This research is done by analyzing data from crowds, and then proceeding to create models of similar situations using software. Many models that simulate crowd behavior exists, with some stating \\"macroscopic models like network- based models or fluid-dynamics models as well as microscopic models like e.g. the Social Force Model or Cellular Automata.\\"  Methodology  Crowd density refers to the number of objects within a unit area, such as people per square meter.Still, G. Keith, \\"Crowd Safety and Risk Analysis\\", G. Keith Still, August 2016 Density is important to determine the maximum occupancy of a room or building to address safety concerns. Analyzing areas that become more densely packed than others is essential for designing buildings and evacuation routes. Addressing such concerns involve the management and optimization of the crowd and its predict movement patterns. Crowd flow involves the speed that objects in a crowd move in a space. At a critical capacity, flow begins to decrease as crowd density increases. The Yerkes-Dodson law explains how performance is impacted by the amount of stress on an individual. The stress is caused by external factors such as an object coming at the individual, a time constraint for the individual to perform a task, or the number of agents crowding an individual.S. Kim, S. Guy, D. Manocha, M. Lin, \\"Interactive Simulation of Dynamic Crowd Behaviors using General Adaptation Syndrome Theory\\", Gamma research group, February 2015 In regards to computer animation, simulated individuals (referred to as agents) are often written to portray realistic crowd-like behavior. They follow algorithm based on stress, navigation fields, and surrounding agents in order to manipulate behavior. The study of producing intelligent agents to follow lifelike behavior falls under the field of artificial intelligence.  Applications  The data drawn from crowd analysis is invaluable in a range of fields and real world implementations. = Crowd Artificial Intelligence = Otherwise referred to as swarm intelligence, the analysis and application of crowd movement can contribute to the modeling of group behavior based on biological and artificial models. Social instinct behavior is applied to complex systems that model multiple agents and their interactions. Population-based methods are used to represent local interactions of agents with their surroundings. = Sociology = There are countless social applications of crowd analysis ranging from uses within the film and video game industries, to uses in public planning. Being that crowd simulations are based on group dynamics and crowd psychology, the accuracy and relevance to real life situations is clear. A large aspect of public planning and its use of crowd analysis lies within the realm of situational representations for emergency evacuation. Evacuations can be planned via the modeling and study of crowd interaction and reaction. These representations are based on biological models and patterns, thus the movements predicted are quite realistic. Similar models are utilized within motion picture industries to produce realistic and lifelike simulations and scenes. = Simulations = A system can generate a realistic crowd simulation with given inputs and simulate how the simulated moving objects, or agents, will interact with each other and with the environment. The goal is to replicate a crowd's movement patterns given a large number of agents in a given space. Algorithms based on crowd analysis attempt to manage the movement of the crowd.

Background The fifth of thirteen sons (alongside one daughter) of the Rev. George Wilson, of Kirby Cane, Norfolk, rector of Didlington (younger brother of the tenth Baron Berners,Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage thirtieth edition, 1868, pg 1185 Wilson was educated at Norwich School.The Norvicensian, No. 1, 1873, pg 39 Early career After training at the Honourable East India Company's military college at Addiscombe, Wilson was commissioned in the Bengal Artillery aged eighteen. Reaching India in 1819 he subsequently saw active service in the siege of Bharatpur and during the Second Sikh War. As an artilleryman Wilson was appointed to staff positions which included adjutant-general of the Bengal Artillery and superintendent of the Cossipore foundry. Role in Great Rebellion of 1857 In 1857 Wilson was serving as Brigadier Commandant of Bengal Artillery at Meerut, the regimental headquarters.The Norvicensian, No. 1, 1873, pg 40 This was the military station where the mutiny of the Bengal Army first broke out on 10 May 1857. Wilson was to be criticised for his inactivity in Meerut, enabling the bulk of the sepoy mutineers to escape to Delhi. Departing on 27 May, Wilson did however lead his column to victory over the mutineers in an action between Meerut and Delhi on the 30th, then joined with the Delhi Field Force, the commander of which, Sir Henry Barnard, died soon after, Wilson being selected (in preference to three senior officers)Forty-one Years in India: From Subaltern to Commander-in-Chief, Field-Marshal Lord Roberts of Kandahar, Asian Educational Services, 2005, pg 108 in command on 17 July.

Delhi was then captured after six days of street fighting. Wilson subsequently commanded the whole of the Artillery at the siege of Lucknow in 1858, for which successes he was nominated in succession a Companion, Knight Commander, and Knight Grand Cross (17 Nov. 1853) of the Order of the Bath, created a baronet 8 January 1858 (with an amended patent issued 8 July 1858, allowing the succession of his baronetcy to the heirs male of his eldest brother, George) and was granted a pension of ¬£1,000 by the East India Company.

History The year 1970 was a milestone year for Apollon Paralimnio. In 1970, the idea of merging two groups began. By Digenis and Iraklis Paralimnio. On 14 April 1971, the sports club was officially founded under the name \\"Football Club of Paralimnio Apollon\\". The purpose of the association as described in its statutes is the symmetrical and harmonious development of the physical and mental strength and skills of the members and the creation of strong and moral characters by using competition and football in combination with the implementation of an educational program for athletes. After the change of the millennium, the successes of Apollon in terms of titles begin. The beginning is in the season 2000-01 with the conquest of the FCA Serres Cup. This is followed by an even more successful season, in 2001-2002, when they won the double of the local association, acquiring at the same time the right to participate in the Fourth National Division of Greece. They remained in the 4th National for five consecutive years until the 2005-2006 season. In the meantime, in 2004-05, they won the FCA Serres Cup again. The team immediately enters a very difficult period in its history after not finding the appropriate interest from people to continue Apollon. The 2011-12 season begins with a new effort by young people with an appetite for work and a vision for the team. The necessary funds have been found to regenerate the team and make a fresh start with players who come from the lakeside, with the player-coach and president Keramaris Dimitris in front, along with a group of people determined to bring the team back to success while always keeping a low profile. He started his career by participating in the 3rd category of EPS SERRES and ascended to the AŒÑCategory in two years. In the 2015-16 season, he manages to return to the National categories, facing Makedonikos, AO Kardia and Doxa Petrousas in the promotion barrages. In the periods 2012-13, 2014‚Äì15 and 2017‚Äì18, he becomes the cup winner of FCA Serres again. The year 2018 was, so far, the most successful in the history of the team, managing to win the championship of the first group of the Third National, participating in the promotion barrages for the promotion to the Second National, with opponents Iraklis, Volos and Tilikratis. The 2019-20 season is the most historic season, with the team participating in the groups of the Greek Cup. In order to enter the groups, she had to exclude Feres (cup winner of FCA Evros) and Aiginiakos (Second National) in knockout matches. In the groups, he faced Trikala (Second National), Apollon Smyrnis (First National) and Asteras Tripolis (First National).

Personal life  Rene di Rosa was born in Boston and graduated from Yale University where he was editor of the Yale Daily News. He took a job in 1950 as a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle after serving in World War II and then spending some time in Paris. Di Rosa married artist Veronica McDonald (1934-1991) in 1974.  Winery Lake Vineyard In 1960, di Rosa purchased 460 acres of land in Carneros region in the Napa Valley. Sullivan gives the size of the purchase as 400 acres. On a 250-acre portion of that land, in an area once known as Talcoa Vineyard, di Rosa planted grapes and called his new fields the Winery Lake Vineyard. Prial gives the size of the planted field as 225 acres. Di Rosa produced Chardonnay and Pinot noir on site, but he received the most accolades for the grapes he sold to other vineyards in the region, including Belvedere and Acacia. In 1979, di Rosa was a founding partner of Hagafen Cellars, along with Ernie Weir, Zach Berkowitz, and Norm Miller. In 1986, di Rosa sold the Winery Lake Vineyard to Joseph E. Seagram & Sons and used the money to invest in his art collection.  Art collection  Di Rosa became acquainted with the Northern California counterculture artists in San Francisco's North Beach when he first arrived in the 1950s. He became very involved in collecting Northern California art in the 1960s while taking viticulture classes at UC Davis, whose art department included Robert Arneson, Roy De Forest, and William T. Wiley, among others. Di Rosa's collection consists of works of art spanning Bay Area movements such as assemblage, the Bay Area Figurative Movement, Funk Art, and Conceptual Art. Key artists include Joan Brown, Jay DeFeo, Viola Frey, Robert Arneson, William T. Wiley, Peter Voulkos, Robert H. Hudson, Bruce Conner, Manuel Neri, Carlos Villa, Nathan Oliveira, Richard Shaw, David Best, and more. Di Rosa housed his collection in a historic home (formally of Talcoa Vineyard) and additional buildings he constructed on his property, most of which is classified as a nature preserve under the Land Trust of Napa County. In 1997, he opened the property, dubbed the di Rosa Preserve, to visitors. In 2000, the collection and property was incorporated as a public trust. In 2002, di Rosa stepped down and the institution's first executive director, Jack Rasmussen, was hired. Now referred to simply as di Rosa, the organization maintains the collection, organizes rotating contemporary art exhibitions, and presents educational and public programs.

Early life and family Of his birth, parentage, and early education nothing has been transmitted. He was at the university of Oxford, and is named by Anthony √† Wood; but in what college does not appear. In his ‚ÄòConcordance‚Äô he describes himself as B.D. He was presented by Lord Wharton to the rectory of Waddesdon, Buckinghamshire, in 1648. The living included three separate rectories. One of these had been simultaneously bestowed on a John Ellis, ‚Äòwho scrupled to take the title upon him, and only preached every other Lord's day in his turn.‚Äô Bennet discharged all the other duties of baptising, pastoral visitation, preaching, etc., but freely let Ellis enjoy half the profits. From the parish registers it is found that he was married, and that his wife's Christian name was Margaret. A son Gervase and daughter Margaret appear among the baptisms. Later life On the passing of the Act of Uniformity in 1662, Bennet joined the two thousand ejected, while Ellis conformed, and got his majesty's title to all the three benefices. To his honour, however, it must be recorded that he allowed the ejected rector 55l. for life. After some time spent in retirement in Derbyshire ‚Äî probably his native county ‚Äî he settled at Aylesbury, where he preached privately to a small congregation. Thence he removed to Abingdon, Berkshire, where he died 6 April 1687. It may be noted that Lipscomb in his list of the rectors of Waddesdon designates him Richard. Probably the mistake originated in the fact that a former rector (in 1383) was a Richard Bennet. His ‚ÄòTheological Concordance‚Äô has only R. Bennet, but the parish entry is distinctly Robert, and so Calamy. Works Bennet was the author of ‚ÄòA Theological Concordance of the Synonymous Terms in the Holy Scriptures, wherein the many various and different Words and Phrases that concur in Sense and Signification, are exactly referred to their distinct Heads and Common Places, digested in an Alphabetical Order.

Mason Sr. (October 7, 1928 ‚Äì July 8, 2006), was a physician who was a family practitioner and civil rights leader in Biloxi, Mississippi. He is noted for organizing three wade-ins, from 1959 to 1963, to desegregate the city's public beaches, which had been made with federal funds. This was the first nonviolent civil disobedience action conducted in Mississippi in the 1950s. After conducting the second protest on April 24, 1960, which was attacked by white mobs, Mason helped found the Biloxi chapter of the NAACP, and was elected president. He served in that position for more than 30 years, as well as head of the Mississippi state NAACP. In addition to his practice, Mason gained full privileges at Biloxi Regional Hospital and later served as chairman of family practice there. Late in life he wrote a memoir about his early political activities, called Beaches, Blood, and Ballots: A Black Doctor's Civil Rights Struggle (2000). Biography Gilbert Mason was born in Jackson, Mississippi, the capital, to Willie Atwood Mason and Adeline (Jackson) Mason. He received his secondary education in Jackson. In 1949, Mason graduated from Tennessee State University with a BS degree and received an MD degree in 1954 from Howard University, a historically black college.The HistoryMakers: Dr. Gilbert R. Mason, Sr. Retrieved 2016-12-18. He served his internship in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1955, Dr. Mason moved to the Gulf Coast and established a family medical practice in Biloxi, Mississippi. He was the second African-American doctor in Harrison County, after Dr. Felix Dunn from Biloxi. Dunn had established his practice in Gulfport, where he also led the local NAACP branch. The two doctors became colleagues. Mason had married Natalie Hamlar in 1950. They had children together, including a son, Gilbert Mason Jr., who became a doctor like his father. During his medical career, Mason quickly gained respect, but due to local racial conditions, he did not have full privileges at Biloxi Hospital for 15 years. He eventually became chairman of the family practice section at Biloxi Regional Hospital. In 1997, Mason suffered a stroke, and his wife Natalie died in 1999. Mason retired from his medical practice in 2002. In 2004 he married again, to Gwendolyn Lewis Anderson. =Civil rights leader= Dr. Mason is most notable for organizing and participating in Mississippi's first nonviolent civil disobedience action, known as the Biloxi wade-ins, which took place from 1959 to 1963. He and some other men concerned about local conditions set up a Citizens Action Committee, hoping to lessen discrimination. In 1959 he and Dr. Felix Dunn and their families, including children, went swimming at the Biloxi beach to protest the racial segregation of the 26-mile long public waterfront. He and Dunn were taken to the police station and told they could not use the sand beaches, that these were claimed as private property by adjacent homeowners. In April 1960, Mason returned to the beach and was arrested. When other African Americans learned of this, they expressed their support of him. A week later on April 24, 1960, he and others gathered at the beach in a second wade-in to assert their rights to use the public lands. The group of 125 people included elderly men and women, as well as younger adults, teenagers and children. They were attacked by groups of whites across the beaches, in what became known as \\"Bloody Sunday\\". The Biloxi police stood by without taking action. Mason led a third wade-in protest at the beach in the spring 1963, two weeks after the funeral for Medgar Evers, who was assassinated. The protesters faced a much larger group of nearly 2000 white protesters, but this time the police prevented violence against them. A legal challenge to the segregation had been initiated by the US Department of Justice in May 1960, but had been delayed in getting a court hearing. It was not decided until 1968, when the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Mississippi beaches were public (private homeowners had claimed territory on the beach and into the water) and had to be desegregated by federal law. The state decided against appealing the decision to the US Supreme Court. Next actions In 1960, Mason and other activists organized a grassroots effort for a voter registration drive. African Americans had been largely disenfranchised since the turn of the century by the 1890 constitution that imposed poll taxes and literacy tests as barriers. Administration by white officials meant that rulings were subjectively decided against African Americans. After the wade-in protests, Mason and other activists formed the first chapter in Biloxi of the NAACP; he was chosen as president and served in that position for the next 34 years. Mason also served as president of the Mississippi state NAACP for 33 years. In 2000, Mason published a memoir about the wade-ins, entitled Beaches, Blood, and Ballots: A Black Doctor's Civil Rights Struggle. It was written with James Patterson Smith and published by University Press of Mississippi. =Death and legacy= Mason died on July 8, 2006, in Ocean Springs, Mississippi. He was interred in Biloxi City Cemetery, Biloxi, Mississippi. Mason's contributions to the civil rights movement were honored posthumously in May 2009 and 2010. The state of Mississippi designated a section of U.S. Highway 90 near Biloxi as the \\"Dr. Gilbert Mason Sr. Memorial Highway.\\" In addition, the state installed historic markers commemorating these civil rights events on the beach in 2009 and at the Biloxi Light in 2010, to mark the 50th anniversaries of two of the wade-in events. A Head Start center in Biloxi was named for him in 2010. In 2019, the National Science Foundation announced that its third Regional Class Research Vessel would be named in Mason's honor. The Research Vessel Gilbert R. Mason will have dual homeports at the Port of Gulfport and Houma, LA, and will be operated by the Gulf ‚Äì Caribbean Oceanographic Consortium, led by the University of Southern Mississippi (USM) and the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON).

The idea refers to a method teachers use to improve instruction by looking at the information they have about their students. It takes place within the classroom, compared to data-driven decision making. Data-driven instruction works on two levels. One, it provides teachers the ability to be more responsive to students‚Äô needs, and two, it allows students to be in charge of their own learning. Data-driven instruction can be understood through examination of its history, how it is used in the classroom, its attributes, and examples from teachers using this process.  History  Prior to the current emphasis on data and accountability in schools, some school leaders and education researchers focused on standards- based reform in education. From the idea of creating standards comes accountability, the idea that schools should report on their ability to meet the designated standards. Late in the last century and in the early 2000s, an increased emphasis on accountability in public organizations made its way into the realm of education. With the passing of the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act in 2001 came laws requiring schools to provide information to the public concerning the quality of education provided to students. To be able to provide such data, states were mandated to create accountability measures and yearly assessments to gauge the effectiveness of schools in meeting those measures. Following NCLB, more recent legislation under the Race to the Top Act further pushed states to use data gathering and reporting to demonstrate school‚Äôs ability to meet the demands of the public. Embedded in both NCLB and the Race to the Top Act is an assumption that the collection and use of data can lead to increased student performance.  Attributes  Data in the classroom is any information that is visible during instruction that could be used to inform teaching and learning. Types of data include quantitative and qualitative data, although quantitative data is most often used for data- driven instruction. Examples of quantitative data include test scores, results on a quiz, and levels of performance on a periodic assessment. Examples of qualitative data include field notes, student work/artifacts, interviews, focus groups, digital pictures, video, reflective journals. Quantitative and qualitative data is generally captured through two forms of assessments: formative and summative. Formative assessment is the information that is revealed and shared during instruction and is actionable by the teacher or student. Paul Black and Dylan Wiliam offer examples of classroom assessment that is formative in nature, including student observations and discussions, understand pupils‚Äô needs and challenges, and looking at student work. Conversely, summative assessments are designed to determine whether or not a student can transfer their learning to new contexts, as well as for accountability purposes. Formative assessment is the use of information made evident during instruction in order to improve student progress and performance. Summative assessments occur after teaching and learning occurred.  Examples  Understanding the differences between quantitative data vs. qualitative data, as well as formative assessment vs. summative assessment that tease out this data can be defined as assessment literacy. Building assessment literacy also includes knowing when to use which type of assessment and the resulting data to use to inform instruction. The purpose of data driven instruction is to use information to guide teaching and learning. Dylan Wiliam offers examples of data driven instruction using formative assessment: * Clarifying, sharing, and understanding learning intentions and criteria * Eliciting evidence of learners‚Äô achievement * Providing feedback that moves learning forward * Activating students as instructional resources for one another * Activating students as owners of their own learning Because of the lack of timely feedback regarding the results plus the inability to personalize the approach, summative assessments are not readily used for data driven instruction in the classroom. Instead, a variety of information gleaned from different forms of assessments should be used to make decisions about student progress and performance within data-driven instruction. The use of multiple measures of different forms and at different times to make instructional decisions is referred to as triangulation.  Data-Driven Instructional Systems  = Background and origins = Data-Driven Instructional Systems refers to a comprehensive system of structures that school leaders and teachers design in order to incorporate the data into their instructions. Building on organizational and school change literature, Richard Halverson, Jeffrey Grigg, Reid Prichett, and Chris Thomas developed a DDIS framework in an attempt to describe how relevant actors manage school-level internal accountability to external accountability. Specifically, high-stakes external accountability policies such as No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) was implemented to hold schools accountable for the reported standardized, summative assessment metrics. However, schools already had active internal accountability systems that place high emphasis on an ongoing cycle of instructional improvement based on the use of data including formative assessment results and behavioral information. Therefore, when the high-stakes accountability was implemented, schools naturally go through process of alignment between different types of data different purposes and the corresponding tension. Richard Halverson and his colleagues, employing case study approaches, explore leaders‚Äô effort of coordination and alignment process which occurs between extant ‚Äúcentral practices and cultures of schools‚Äù and ‚Äúnew accountability pressure‚Äù in a pursuit of improving student achievement score. = Key concepts = In their article, Richard Halverson, Jeffrey Grigg, Reid Prichett, and Chris Thomas suggest that the DDIS framework is composed of six organizational functions: data acquisition; data reflection; program alignment; program design; formative feedback; test preparation.  Data Acquisition  Data acquisition includes the data collection, data storage, and data reporting functions. ‚ÄúData‚Äù in DDIS model is broadly conceptualized as any type of information that guides teaching and learning. In practice, schools collect academic data standardized assessment test scores, as well as non-academic data like student demographic information, community survey data, curricula, technological capacity, and behavioral records. In order to store such data, some schools develop their own local collection strategies using low-tech printouts and notebooks, whereas other schools rely on high-tech district storage systems, which provide tremendous amounts of reports. School leaders have discussions around which data needs to be reported and how to report the data in a way that they can use to guide teaching practices.  Data Reflection  In the DDIS model, data reflection refers to collectively making sense of the reported data. District-level data retreats provide key opportunities for the schools within districts to identify the school-level strengths and weaknesses in terms of achievement data. Retreats help districts to develop district-level visions for instruction. In contrast, through local data reflection meetings, teachers have conversations focused on the individual students‚Äô progress by examining each student‚Äôs performance on the assessed standards.  Program Alignment  Richard Halverson and his colleagues states that program alignment function refers to ‚Äúlink[ing] the relevant content and performance standards with the actual content taught in classroom.‚Äù For example, the benchmark assessment results, as ‚Äúproblem-finding tools,‚Äù help educators to identify the curricular standards that are not aligned well with the current instructional programs.  Program Design  After identifying the main areas in relation to students learning needs and school goals, leaders and teachers design interventions: faculty-based programs; curriculum-based programs; and student-based programs. In an effort to improve the faculty‚Äôs data literacy, educators are provided with a variety of professional development opportunities and coaching focused on professional interaction (faculty-based programs). In addition, educators modify their curriculum as a whole-classroom approach (curriculum-based programs) or develop customized instructional plans taking into account individual students‚Äô needs (student- based programs).  Formative Feedback  Educators interact with each other around the formative feedback on the local interventions implemented across classrooms and programs. Formative feedback systems are made of three main components: intervention, assessment, and actuation. Intervention artifacts here include curriculum materials like textbooks and experiments, or programs such as individualized education programs (Intervention). The effect of these intervention artifacts can be evaluated through formative assessments, either commercial or self-created, from the perspective that they had brought intended changes to teaching and learning (Assessment). In the actuation space, educators interpret the assessment results in relation to the initial goals of the intervention, and discuss how to modify the instruction delivery or assessment as measurement tools, which lays groundwork for the new interventions (Actuation).  Test Preparation  This function is not intended for teachers to ‚Äúteach to the test.‚Äù Rather, it points to the following activities: curriculum-embedded activities, test practice, environmental design, and community outreach. Teachers incorporate the content of standardized assessment into their day-to-day instructions (curriculum- embedded activities), assist students to practice or be accustomed to test- taking with similar types of tests (test practice), and establish a favorable test-taking environment (environmental design). Further, teachers communicate with parents and the community members on the topics ranging from test implementation to interpreting the test results (community outreach).  Implications  = For school districts = The primary implication for school districts is in ensuring high quality and relevant data is gathered and available. Beyond creating systems to gather and share the data, the school district must provide the expertise, in the form of data expert personnel and/or the access to professional development resources to ensure school building leaders are able to access and use the data. Another critical component of the responsibility of the district is to provide the leadership and vision to promulgate the use of information about student performance to improve teaching practice. Zavadsky and Dolejs suggest two areas for school districts to consider: ‚ÄúThe first is data collection and analysis. Districts and schools must carefully consider what data they need to collect, develop instruments with which to collect the data, and make the data available as soon as possible. The second component is data use. Principals and district leaders must give teachers sufficient time and training to understand the data and learn how to respond to what the data reveal‚Äù. While the literature shows the vital importance of the role of the district in setting the stage for data driven instruction, more of the work of connecting student performance to classroom practices happens at the school and classroom level. = For schools = Schools have a major role in establishing the conditions for data-driven instruction to flourish. Heppen, et al. indicate a need for a clear and consistent focus on using data and a data-rich environment to support teachers‚Äô efforts to use data to drive instruction. When the leadership creates and maintains an environment which promotes collaboration and clearly communicates the urgency to improve student learning, teachers feel supported to engage in data use. The additional scaffold of modeling the use of data at the school level increases teachers‚Äô expertise in the use of data. = For teachers = Data-driven instruction is created and implemented in the classroom. Teachers have the most direct link between student performance and classroom practices. Through the use of data, teachers can make decisions about what and how to teach including how to use time in class, interventions for students who are not meeting standards, customizing lessons based on real- time information, adapting teaching practice to align to student needs, and making changes to pace, scope and sequence.Hamilton et al. - 2009 - Using student achievement data to support instruct.pdf. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED506645.pdf To be able to engage in data- driven instruction, teachers must first develop the knowledge, skills, and dispositions required. Working in a school culture and climate in which data- driven instruction is valued and supported, teachers have the ability to increase student achievement and potentially reduce the achievement gap. Additionally, teachers must have access to learning opportunities or professional development which helps them understand the pedagogical framework and technical skills required to obtain, analyze, and use information about students to make instructional decisions. = For students = A significant new growth in data-driven instruction is in having students shape their lessons using data about their own progress. Younger learners who are able to self-report regarding grades and other assessments can experience high levels of achievement and progress within instruction. To embed data analysis by students into classroom practices, it requires time, training, and action. The strategies that students use to evaluate their own learning vary in effectiveness. In a meta-analysis, Dunlosky, Rawson, Marsh, Nathan & Willingham ranked ten learning strategies based on the projected impact each would have on achievement: Highly Effective Strategies: * Practice testing - self-testing, solving practice problems * Distributed practice - repetitive practice over specific intervals of time Moderately Effective Strategies: * Elaborative interrogation - explaining the 'why' * Self-explanation - explaining how new information relates to what is already known * Interleaved practice - mixing different kinds of problems in a practice session Less Effective Strategies: * Summarization - writing summaries of the material being learned * Highlighting - marking parts of text that are important * Keyword mnemonic - various mnemonic techniques * Imagery use for text learning - attempt to form mental images of the things being read * Rereading - read material again after initial reading It is worth noting that the less effective strategies may be more commonly used in K-12 classrooms than the moderately effective and highly effective strategies. The authors suggest that students should be taught how to use more effective techniques and when they are most helpful in guiding their learning. When these strategies become internalized, students will have developed techniques in order to learn how to learn. This is critical as they move into the secondary level and are expected to be more independent in their studies.  Criticisms  A major criticism of data driven instruction is that it focuses too much on test scores, and that not enough attention is given to the results of classroom assessments. Data driven instruction should serve as a ‚Äúroad map through assessment‚Äù that helps ‚Äúteachers plan instruction to meet students‚Äô needs, leading to better achievement‚Äù. Summative assessments should not be used to inform the day-to- day teaching and learning that is supported by data-driven instruction. Additional problems associated with perceptions of data driven instruction include the limitations of quantitative data to represent student learning, not considering the social and emotional needs or the context of the data when making instructional decisions, and a hyperfocus on the core areas of literacy and mathematics while ignoring the encore, traditionally high-interest areas such as the arts and humanities.

He was a professor at Shaw University, Howard University, and Alcorn University. Early life Newell Houston Ensley was born a slave in Nashville, Tennessee August 23, 1852 to George and Clara Ensley. His family was owned by his mother's father and Ensley was allowed to play with the white children on the farm and to learn to read. While still a child during the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), Ensley ran away and hid in Union Army camps that were nearby until the Army moved on and he returned to the farm where he received a whipping. In spite of this, Ensley remained on the farm after the war was over and the abolition of slavery. His former master died in 1866, a year after the war ended. Ensley's father died some time earlier, and his step-father did not wish him to attend school. In spite of this, he did attend lessons, one of his teachers was Benjamin Holmes, who later was a member of the Fisk Jubilee Singers. Career When Holmes left the school to join the Jubilee Singers on their first tour in 1871, Ensley was appointed in his stead. On top of his teaching duties, Ensley taught the Sunday school. He was also baptized and became a deacon. In February 1871, he entered Roger Williams University where he studied under Daniel W. Phillips. About this time he was licensed to preach. He also became known for his singing. At the same time he attended the six- year classical course Nashville Baptist Institute, receiving a diploma in May 1877. In June 1878 he graduated third in his class from Roger Williams University and entered Newton Theological Seminary in Newton Center, Massachusetts. He graduated three years later as the only black person in a class of seven. After graduating from Newton he took a position of professor of theology and Latin at Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina.The Newton Theological Institution: General Catalogue, Andover Newton Theological School, 1912, p. 160. One year later he moved to Howard University in Washington, DC. About this time he married. He then moved to Alcorn University in Lorman, Mississippi where he held the title of professor of rhetoric, natural sciences, and vocal music from 1882 until his death in 1888. He was a scholar of Greek, and a noted orator and poet. =Civil rights= Later in his life, Ensley frequently traveled to give talks about African-American issues. In June 1883, he was in Chicago for a Baptist Minister Conference at the Grand Pacific Hotel. Reverend E. O. Taylor and a group of ministers including Ensley went to Race Brothers' oyster house. The restaurant had a rule against serving black people, and Ensley was thrown out in an affair which received national coverage. In 1886, he traveled to St. Louis for the First National Convention of Colored Baptists. At that meeting, he spoke out against the poor behavior of certain leaders of the Colored Conventions Movement Personal life and death Elizabeth Piper Ensley was an educator, suffragette, journalist and activist Ensley married Elizabeth Piper Ensley on September 4, 1882, in Boston.

It was created for the New York City ePrix of the single-seater, electrically powered Formula E championship. Its first use was during the 2016‚Äì17 Formula E season when it hosted the 2017 New York City ePrix. Following the last known CART PPG Cup races in the New York metropolitan area in the 1980s, there have been several failed attempts to establish a race in or near New York City for a major automobile series. In September 2016, New York City and F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) officials announced the establishment of a 2017 event in the city for Formula E, with the Red Hook location selected over other potential sites including Central Park. The race was approved due to the absence of air pollution and noise disturbances from the electric-powered race cars, compared to normal gasoline-powered racing automobiles. The inaugural New York City ePrix events were held on July 15‚àí16, 2017, with Sam Bird of DS Virgin Racing winning both races. Description The old 2017 layout of the circuit, with the hairpin at turn 1 The course is situated at the west end of the Red Hook neighborhood in western Brooklyn, adjacent to the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal and the Atlantic Basin, the small body of water within the Upper New York Bay served by the terminal. The site is bound by the east-to-west portion of Bowne Street, the Red Hook Container Terminal, and the Brooklyn‚ÄìBattery Tunnel to the north, and by Wolcott Street to the south. Imlay Street and Conover Street mark the east end of the site, with Van Brunt Street (the primary thoroughfare of Red Hook) one block east. The original configuration of the circuit measured in length and consisted of 13 corners. The course predominantly follows the existing layout of the streets and parking areas of the terminal, separated from the rest of the street plan of Red Hook. The main and second straights utilize the north-south stretch of Bowne Street (which turns south after entering the terminal area), adjacent to Pier 11 of the terminal. Curving west, the track then parallels Clinton Wharf towards the Buttermilk Channel coastline. The track offers views of the Lower Manhattan skyline and the Statue of Liberty. Prior to its inaugural running, driver Felix Rosenqvist described the track as \\"one of those really technical circuits\\" comparable to the Circuit des Invalides on the streets of Paris. For the 2018 race, the circuit was lengthened to , extending the course farther north and west to Summit Street and Hamilton Avenue. As opposed to the original right-hand hairpin at the end of the main straight on Bowne Street, a four-turn complex was added featuring a lefthander and three right-handed turns leading to the second straight. The changes were made to accommodate the second generation Formula E car, introduced in the 2018‚Äì19 season to replace the Spark-Renault SRT 01E. The new cars have increased downforce and power. =Entrances and amenities= A BMW i3 electric car on display in the eVillage at the 2017 ePrix. The Brooklyn Street Circuit features two grandstands. Grandstand 1 is located on the main straight in front of Pier 11 of the ship terminal, just to the west of the start-finish line, providing a view of the starting grid. The smaller Grandstand 2 is just to the west, also adjacent to Pier 11, in front of the turn leading to the main straight. According to Formula E CEO Alejandro Agag, the organizers were \\"quite cautions\\" in designing the seating area. Various pedestrian overpass bridges are set up around the circuit to cross the track. Like at other Formula E events, the Brooklyn Street Circuit features an eVillage entertainment area. It features displays of technological innovations and electric- and hybrid-powered production vehicles, racing simulators, and it hosts a driver autograph session prior to the race. Food and drinks are available from stands and local food trucks located within the event. The original 2017 layout featured three entrances to the track. Entrance 1 (e1) is located at Ferris Street and King Street near the paddock and podium areas. Entrance 2 (e2) is located adjacent to the NYC Ferry landing of the cruise terminal, leading to the grandstands. Entrance 3 (e3) was located on Pioneer Street near Van Brunt Street, leading directly to the eVillage. An overpass bridge led from this entrance to the grandstands. For the 2018 event, entrance 3 was moved one block north to Verona Street. Two additional entrances were added. The first (e4) is located at Imlay Street and Bowne Street near the new turn complex. The second (e5) is located at Brooklyn Cruise Terminal Pier 12. The former eVillage area near entrance 3 will instead be used for race suites and an accreditation center. The new eVillage will be located behind grandstand 1 and around the new turn complex near entrance 4. History View of the circuit in 2017. =Previous races in the New York area= One of the earliest known automobile races in New York City was in 1896, when six cars competed in a race between the city and Westchester County, New York. In 1904, William Kissam Vanderbilt II began hosting the Vanderbilt Cup, held on a circuit of local dirt roads in Nassau County, Long Island. In 1908 Vanderbilt began construction on the Long Island Motor Parkway (also known as the Vanderbilt Parkway), a paved and grade separated limited-access highway between Queens and Nassau County, to host the race beginning that year. The course only used a section of the parkway located in Nassau County between Westbury and Hicksville. Following a crash in the 1910 Vanderbilt Cup, the New York State Legislature banned all automobile racing outside of self-contained circuits. The parkway remained open to normal passenger traffic as a toll road until 1938, and was largely replaced by the free Northern State Parkway and Grand Central Parkway. The Vanderbilt Cup was later held at Roosevelt Raceway (now a horse racing course) in Westbury, Nassau County in 1936 and 1937. A NASCAR Grand National Series race was held at Linden Airport in Linden, New Jersey in 1954. In June 1956 Wall Stadium in Wall Township, New Jersey hosted a race for NASCAR's Convertible Division, with Glen Wood of Wood Brothers Racing participating. In July 1958 the track held a race for the Grand National Series. To this day, Wall Stadium is a popular Modified stop for various Northeastern-based touring series, including the Whelen Modified Tour, NASCAR's popular touring series in the Northeast, and forms the core for their local racing program, which has featured legendary engineer Ray Evernham and premership champion Martin Truex, Jr. as drivers who have raced on local cards, which is most notable for Turkey Derby held in late November since 1974. The Vanderbilt Cup was revived as a Formula Junior event in 1960 at Roosevelt Raceway. In 1965, 1967 and 1968 the Bridgehampton Sports Car Races, held at Bridgehampton Race Circuit located in Suffolk County in eastern Long Island, were billed as the Vanderbilt Cup. For many years afterwards, attempts have been made to establish an event for a major auto racing series within the New York metropolitan area, including Formula One, NASCAR, and IndyCar. In 1975 and again in 1983, a racing circuit to host a Formula One Grand Prix event was proposed for the New York City area. Potential sites included Flushing Meadows‚ÄìCorona Park in the borough of Queens, and the Meadowlands Sports Complex in New Jersey. The Flushing Meadows plans were opposed by the local community and environmental groups, and the race was postponed and ultimately cancelled by 1985. The Meadowlands site would host the Meadowlands Grand Prix Champ Car event in 1984. Beginning in 2003, a NASCAR track called Liberty Speedway was planned, with potential sites at the Meadowlands and Linden in New Jersey, and Bloomfield in western Staten Island. In December 2004, the International Speedway Corporation (owned by NASCAR) and The Related Companies purchased the Staten Island site. At the time the planned 80,000-seat track was the largest proposed sports venue in the city, with greater potential seating capacity than the proposed West Side Stadium or the future Barclays Center. After protests from environment groups over pollution and the loss of wetlands in the area, and from local residents over potential traffic congestion and parking issues, in 2006 NASCAR cancelled plans for the track. In July 2012, New York State Assembly candidate Paul Saryian proposed reviving the plans for the Staten Island track as part of a potential bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics. Around 2012, Formula One again planned to hold the Grand Prix of America on the proposed Port Imperial Street Circuit in New Jersey, but by 2014, the plan had fallen through. In 2015, NASCAR was seriously considering buying stock in order to build a track in New York City. Existing NASCAR Cup Series tracks in close proximity to New York City include Watkins Glen International in upstate New York, Pocono Raceway in Pennsylvania, and Dover International Speedway in Dover, Delaware. Watkins Glen also held Formula One events from 1961 to 1980. New Jersey Motorsports Park, which has held races for the ARCA Racing Series and the NASCAR K&N; Pro Series East (a developmental NASCAR series), is located in southern New Jersey. The now-defunct Nazareth Speedway, located in eastern Pennsylvania, hosted the IndyCar Firestone Indy 225 event, and NASCAR Busch Series (now Xfinity Series) and Truck Series events until its closure in 2004. The Meadowlands site has also hosted domestic motorcycle racing; the American Flat Track championship runs on the Meadowlands Racetrack, as their series often runs during off-season for horse racing at notable horse tracks. =New York City ePrix= In March 2014, it was announced that Formula E was working with New York City authorities to bring a motor race to the area. On September 21, 2016, F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) President Jean Todt, Formula E CEO Alejandro Agag, and New York City government officials announced that the New York City ePrix would be held in July 2017 at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal in Red Hook, with a track layout presented. Government officials approved the ePrix only because, as an electric race, it would not create noise or air pollution. Originally, planners considered Governors Island, Central Park, and Liberty State Park in Jersey City as possible locations for the track. However, these sites were not chosen since a Governors Island track would have been too costly; a Central Park track would have required demolishing trees; and Liberty State Park was outside the city limits. In June 2017, Brooklyn-based McLaren Engineering Group (unrelated to the racing team) and D‚ÄôOnofrio General Contractors Corp were contracted to create the circuit within the terminal. Construction of the track began on July 2, thirteen days before the first race. Much of the project involved erecting both temporary and permanent structures for the race, while existing infrastructure such as signs and curbing had to be removed or redesigned to facilitate the race course. The temporary infrastructure of a typical Formula E street circuit includes track barriers and curbs, grandstands, pedestrian overpass bridges, and electronic cables for television broadcasting and race scoring. After the end of the event, this equipment is transported to the next location. In the case of the Brooklyn Street Circuit, most of the materials were locally acquired, with only the fencing for the track provided by Formula E. Permanent structures built for the Brooklyn circuit included the cruise terminal's guardhouse, which was originally situated in the middle of the proposed circuit. It was rebuilt in order to be portable so it could be moved prior to the event, and then reinstalled into its normal location after the event. Much of the area was repaved for the event as well. A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held on July 12, 2017, upon the arrival of the race cars. The first race of the inaugural event was held on July 15, 2017, won by Sam Bird of DS Virgin Racing. Bird won the second race of the weekend on July 16, after which the track was taken apart. For the 2018 event, the track was lengthened and reconfigured. Access and transportation The bus route runs one block east of the circuit along Van Brunt Street, between Downtown Brooklyn and Park Slope/Windsor Terrace. The closest New York City Subway stations are the Carroll Street and Smith‚ÄìNinth Streets on the IND Culver Line () along Smith Street. The B61 connects with the Smith‚ÄìNinth Streets station. On race days, shuttle buses operate to the race track from the Carroll Street station, and from the Atlantic Avenue‚ÄìBarclays Center station complex in Downtown Brooklyn. The circuit is also close to the NYC Ferry stops at Red Hook and Brooklyn Bridge Park Pier 6. The Red Hook ferry landing is located at entrance 2 adjacent to the track.

From 2010 Davies and Day continued the press as the two remaining founders, Day concentrating on the setting and design of the books, and Davies on their editing, publicising and distribution. Collaboration Davies and Phil Day (artist) have collaborated on books since 2008. Their first collaboration being Cat's eye (2008), a short story by Davies, with copper engravings by Day. Their most recent collaborations are the \\"tangentially related\\" novels Crow Mellow (2014) and Call Me (2018).

He was knighted by King George IV. Family King George IV's entry into Dublin in 1821 Born in 1783 to Sir John Lees, 1st Baronet and Mary Cathcart, Lees was the fourth son with six brothers and a sister, amongst them the Irish clergyman and political pamphleteer Harcourt Lees. He married a daughter of Capt. Clarke of the 40th Regiment of Foot in 1821 but they had no issue. Lees was personally knighted by King George IV during his state visit to Ireland in the same year. For many years Lees had a heart complaint and died at Broughty Ferry, on the outskirts of Dundee on 24 September 1846. Career At only 18 years of age, by a patant dated 23 March 1801, Lees was jointly appointed with his father as Secretary of the Irish Post Office, a position his father already held in his own right since 1774 until his death in 1811.

Between Edward Lees and his father, they held sway for almost 60 years but despite the reports of bribery Edward was not expelled from the post office, instead he was transferred to the same position in Edinburgh in 1831. In April 1840, as part of the British postal reforms, Lees was responsible for informing the Scottish postmaster about the introduction of the first postage stamps and the accompanying postal stationery, sending them samples of the Mulready stationery and the Penny Black, though, as they were not ready at that time, no Two penny blue stamp samples were sent. His notice also provided information on possible forgeries and cancelling the new stamps.

The malt tax riots were a wave of protest against the imposition of the English malt tax on Scotland. The riots began in Hamilton on 23 June 1725 and soon spread throughout the country. The fiercest protests, the Shawfield riots, were in Glasgow, but significant disturbances occurred in Edinburgh, Stirling, Dundee, Ayr, Dundee, Elgin and Paisley. The Lord Advocate, Robert Dundas, an opponent of the imposition of the malt tax on Scotland, published an anti-malt tax pamphlet and was sacked. General Wade was appointed to quell the protests and several rioters were killed or transported. However, the British government was forced to make concessions, and the riots led to the establishment of the Board of Trustees for Manufacturers and Fisheries in 1727. Background A duty on malt had been imposed in England to pay for a war against France. At the union with Scotland in 1707, most taxes were made uniform, but under the Treaty of Union Scotland was given a temporary exemption from the malt tax, until the end of the war. An extension of the Malt Tax to Scotland was proposed in 1713 but abandoned in the face of opposition. By the 1720s the English were attempting to reform the Scottish taxation system. This climate of political turmoil promoted George Drummond by 1723. In 1725, the House of Commons applied a new malt tax which applied throughout Great Britain, but charged at only half the rate in Scotland. Scots were unused to this tax, which increased the price of beer. Enraged citizens in Glasgow drove out the military and destroyed the home of Daniel Campbell, their representative in parliament, who had voted for the tax.Chalmers, George Caledonia, or, A historical and topographical account of North Britain, vol. 2 (1887). In Edinburgh, brewers went on strike, illegally. Andrew Millar, then a book trade apprentice, helped overthrow attempts by Edinburgh magistrates to control dissemination of opinion during the unrest by printing opposition material in Leith, outside the council of Edinburgh's jurisdiction. The pamphlet Millar refers to in the letter to Robert Wodrow dated 10 August 1725, and his actions detailed in the letter dated 15 July, emphasized contemporary doubts and challenges to the strike's \\"illegality\\".

Subsequently acquired by Sir Percival David and latterly by Meiso Mizuhara.Auction: 16012 ‚Äì Meiso Mizuhara, The Exhibition Collections, The Chinese Customs Post Lot: 1514. Spink. Retrieved 6 October 2016. John Alexander Agnew (1872 ‚Äì 2 August 1939) was a New Zealand mining engineer who worked with future United States president Herbert Hoover and later became chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields, the first chairman of the firm to be from a mining engineering background. In his spare time he was a noted philatelist whose collection of Chinese stamps and postal history was regarded as one of the finest of his era. Early life and family John Alexander Agnew was born in New Zealand in 1872. He studied under professor James Park at the University of Otago School of Mines.\\"Mr. J. A. Agnew\\", The Times, 4 August 1939, p. 14. His son was Dolf Agnew and his grandson was Sir Rudolph Agnew, group chief executive of Consolidated Goldfields plc from 1978 to 1989 and chairman from 1983 to 1989. Agnew was a board member of the Cementation Company, and asked his son-in-law Abram Rupert Neelands, a Canadian mining engineer to look over the company and report its prospects. The shareholders were impressed with a report produced by Rupert, and asked if he could commit to the company. The offer was accepted on the basis Rupert had 'full charge and complete control', and he took over management of the business in 1921. Career Agnew's early career was at the Thames Goldfield in New Zealand where he became the mine manager. In 1898 he moved to Western Australia where he worked for Bewick Moreing & Company under mining engineer and future American president Herbert Hoover. He travelled with Hoover to China but returned to Australia in 1903 when their work was interrupted by the Boxer Rebellion. In 1912 he resigned from Bewick MoreingThe Mining Magazine, Vol. VII, No. 2 (August 1912), p. 142. and travelled to London where Hoover had mining interests.Liggett, Walter W. (1932) The rise of Herbert Hoover. New York: H.K. Fly. p. 83. Based in London, Agnew travelled widely and particularly in north and south America and was involved with Herbert Hoover and Francis Algernon Govett in Lake View and Oroya Exploration Limited, Lake View and Star Limited, Camp Bird Limited, and Santa Gertrudis Limited. After the First World War he was involved with the Burma Corporation Limited among other companies. He became a director of Consolidated Gold Fields in 1922 and chairman in March 1933, succeeding the fourth Lord Brabourne. Agnew was the first mining engineer to hold the position.\\"The Agnew connection\\", Gold Fields Golden Age, September 2012, p. 17. He held a large number of other company appointments as director or chairman and it was thought by some that in some cases his appointments and shareholdings were on behalf of Herbert Hoover who had resigned his company appointments after 1919.Liggett, p. 377. He was credited by The Times with playing a leading part in the renaissance of mining in Western Australia, particularly at Lake View and Wiluna, and a similarly important role in the development of mining in the Gold Coast, the Far West Rand, and gold-dredging at Bulolo in New Guinea. Agnew joined the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy in 1906 and served on its council. He was awarded their gold medal in 1934. He was chairman of the Western Australian Mine Owners' Association. The gold mining town of Agnew, Western Australia is named after him. In 1949, the gold mine closed. An operating gold mine is located adjacent to the townsite, and is also named Agnew. The mine is owned by Gold Fields. Philately Agnew specialised in the stamps and postal history of China and built a collection that was rumoured to be housed in 60 albums and was regarded as one of the finest of his time. He bought most of the proofs and essays owned by Sir Robert Hart after Hart's death in 1911. He became a member of the Royal Philatelic Society London in 1923, and a fellow in 1927, and in December that year he gave a display to the society on the essays of the first stamps of China, his paper on the subject appearing in The London Philatelist in February 1928. In 1929, he displayed his collection of \\"The Treaty Ports of China\\" to the society and his paper on that subject was published in the journal for December 1929.\\"Mr. J. A. Agnew\\", The London Philatelist, Vol. XLVIII, No. 572 (August 1939), p. 266. He was awarded the society's Tilleard Medal the same year\\"The Royal Philatelic Society\\" in Gibbons Stamp Monthly, Vol. 2, No. 12 (September 1929), p. 234. for his 1927 display. Among his awards for competitive displays were a gold medal for his North Borneo at the Strasburg Philatelic Exhibition of 1927,\\"Strasburg Philatelic Exhibition, 1927\\" in Stanley Gibbons Monthly Journal, Vol. IV, No. 10 (1 July 1927), p. 1. and gold medals for his China displays at the International Philatelic Exhibition, Le Havre, in 1929\\"International Philatelic Exhibition, Le Havre\\" in Gibbons Stamp Monthly, Vol. 2, No. 10 (July 1929), p. 189. and at the 1930 Antwerp exhibition.\\"Antwerp: British Successes\\" in Gibbons Stamp Monthly, Vol. 3, No. 12 (September 1930), p. 225. It is likely that after his death, much of his collection, possibly the whole of it, was acquired by Sir Percival David, whose collection, sold by Robson Lowe between 1964 and 1975, is thought to be the most important of China ever assembled. Material from David's collection, including items formerly owned by Agnew, in turn entered the Meiso Mizuhara collection.\\"Designs for the first Chinese stamps: Proofs and essays from the Meiso Mizuhara collection\\" by Neill Granger in Spink Insider, No. 23 (Winter 2015), pp. 66‚Äì67. Death In June 1939, Agnew left England on a tour of the mining interests of the Yukon Consolidated Gold Corporation, of which he was the president, on the edge of the Arctic Circle. He also visited properties in the United States. He died at Trona, California, from pneumonia on 2 August 1939. His home in London at the time of his death was in West Heath Avenue, Hampstead.

He succeeded his father Lu'lu' al-Kabir, with whom he had shared power. Unlike Lu'lu', however, Mansur's rule was opposed by Aleppo's notables, who chafed at his oppression and monopolization of power. Both Mansur and his father harassed the remaining members of the Hamdanid dynasty, in whose name they ostensibly ruled. On the diplomatic front, Mansur balanced ties with both the Byzantine Empire and the Fatimid Caliphate, and maintained the emirate's Shia Muslim orientation. Mansur fought off two attempts to reinstall Hamdanid rule in the city, critically aided each time by the powerful Banu Kilab tribe. In return, Mansur promised the Kilab half of the emirate's revenues, but reneged on the agreement. To rid himself of the Kilab, he set a trap for them by inviting hundreds of their tribesmen to a feast only to ambush them. The tribesmen were either killed or imprisoned in the Citadel of Aleppo between 1012 and 1014. By the latter year, one of the Kilabi chieftains, Salih ibn Mirdas, escaped and went to war with Mansur, who was captured. To gain his freedom, he agreed to release all Kilabi prisoners and accord Salih half of the emirate's revenues. He reneged on the latter stipulation, prompting a renewal of conflict with the Kilab, who effectively besieged Aleppo. In 1016, Mansur's citadel commander, Fath al-Qal'i, rebelled in collaboration with Salih and forced Mansur to flee Aleppo. The Byzantine emperor Basil II gave Mansur asylum in Antioch and a fief near the Byzantine‚ÄìArab frontier. Afterward, Mansur became a commander of a Byzantine army unit and was in the entourage of Emperor Romanos III during the Battle of Azaz against Salih's son and successor, Shibl al-Dawla Nasr, in 1030. Early life and career Mansur was the son of Lu'lu' al-Kabir, a former ghulƒÅm (slave soldier; pl. ghilmƒÅn) of the Hamdanid emirs of Aleppo who became ·∏•ƒÅjib (chamberlain) under Emir Sa'd al-Dawla (r. 967‚Äì991).Zakkar 1971, p. 43. Though Sa'd was officially succeeded by his son Sa'id al-Dawla, power was effectively held by Lu'lu' al-Kabir. When Sa'id al-Dawla died in January 1002, Lu'lu' ruled Aleppo in the name of Sa'id al-Dawla's young sons Abu al-Hasan Ali and Abu al-Ma'ali Sharif until ousting them shortly afterward and declaring himself a ruler in his own right. Mansur ruled as his father's deputy and partner.Zakkar 1971, pp. 43‚Äì44. Both Mansur and Lu'lu' harassed the remaining members of the Hamdanid dynasty in Aleppo, prompting one of them, Abu al- Hayja' to flee the city for Byzantine territory where he received official protection.Zakkar 1971, p. 44. At one point Mansur was made governor of Raqqa, which was taken from him by the Numayrid emir Waththab ibn Sabiq in 1007.Rice 1952, p. 75. Emir of Aleppo =Conflict with the Hamdanids= Lu'lu' al- Kabir died in 1008 and was succeeded by Mansur. Mansur attempted to concentrate further power into his hands at the expense of the Aleppine a øyƒÅn (local elite), though he formally continued his predecessors' policy of separating the Emirate of Aleppo's civil administration from its military command.Amabe 2016, p. 59. On the diplomatic front, he maintained the Byzantines' virtual protectorate over Aleppo, though he also developed contacts with the Cairo-based Fatimid Caliphate. Basing his information on the chronicles of medieval Aleppine historians, historian Suhayl Zakkar wrote, > Unlike his father, Mansur was over-confident, short-sighted, a drunkard, > '[an] oppressor and unjust'. Because of this the Aleppines hated him and > several of their poets cursed him in their poems. ... The population of > Aleppo ... began to search for a way to get rid of him. As time went by he > was heedlessly and arrogantly increasing his oppression. ... the Aleppines > found that the restoration of the Hamdanid dynasty would be the solution. > They recalled and emphasized the fact that Mansur himself was the son of > [the] Hamdanids' slave who had betrayed his masters and who had usurped > their rights.Zakkar 1971, pp. 44‚Äì45. With Mansur's rule lacking any strong foundation, his opponents among Aleppine factions or individuals, unnamed in sources, resolved to move against him and install Abu'l-Hayja' to the emirate. They gained the support of the Banu Kilab tribe, one of the most powerful elements in the emirate, and then appealed for the assistance of the Marwanid ruler of Diyar Bakr, Mumahhid al-Dawla; the latter was Abu'l-Hayja's father-in-law.Zakkar 1971, p. 45‚Äì46. Mumahhid al- Dawla secured Byzantine Emperor Basil II's permission for Abu'l-Hayja' to leave Byzantine territory and depose Mansur, provided that Mumahhid bear the financial expense of such an endeavor.Zakkar 1971, p. 46. Indeed, Mumahhid supplied Abu'l-Hayja' with money and 200 horsemen, and the Hamdanid was further promised the critical support of the Kilabi chieftains, whom he met on his way to Aleppo. However, once Mansur caught wind of the Kilab's backing for Abu'l-Hayja', he wrote to the tribe's chieftains, promising them a share of the Emirate of Aleppo's revenues and control of some of its rural areas in return for withdrawing their support for the Hamdanid. Moreover, Mansur appealed for military aid from Fatimid Caliph al-Hakim; Mansur promised to allow a Fatimid appointed governor control the Citadel of Aleppo in return for such aid, which came in the form of Fatimid troops from Tripoli. By the time Mansur's Fatimid reinforcements arrived in Aleppo, Abu'l-Hayja' and the Kilab had reached the city's outskirts.Zakkar 1971, p. 47. The Fatimid troops marched toward Abu'l-Hayja's camp, after which the Kilab, having secretly agreed to Mansur's offer, abandoned Abu'l-Hayja'. The latter then fled back to Byzantine territory. Basil II at first refused to once again grant asylum to the Hamdanid, but Mansur persuaded him to keep Abu'l-Hayja' under virtual house arrest in the Byzantine capital, Constantinople. Meanwhile, Mansur did not abide by his promise to al-Hakim, who responded by sending an army from Cairo with the aim of replacing Mansur with the Hamdanid emir Abu al-Ma'ali Sharif.Zakkar 1971, p. 48. This army made it to Ma'arrat al-Nu'man, in Aleppo's countryside, in 1011, but retreated after encountering resistance by the Kilab, who attempted to kidnap Abu al-Ma'ali Sharif and sell him to Mansur. =Subjugation of the Kilab= Mansur avoided giving the Kilab their promised share of the emirate, and when the Kilabi chieftains demanded Mansur abide by their secret agreement, Mansur procrastinated or used diplomatic means to stave off the tribesmen.Zakkar 1971, p. 49. According to Zakkar, the Kilab \\"neither understood nor trusted diplomacy. When Mansur paid nothing to the Kilabis they began to take.\\" Accordingly, the tribesmen set up their encampments immediately outside of Aleppo and applied pressure against Mansur by grazing their flocks in the city's gardens, orchards and grain fields. They cut down olive trees and paralysed life in the city. Not strong enough to check the Kilab, Mansur engineered a ploy to rid himself of them.Bianquis 1993, p. 116. He pretended to accept Kilabi demands and enter a permanent settlement with the tribe. To feign good faith, he held a feast at his palace in Aleppo on 27 May 1012, hosting between 700 and 1,000 Kilabi tribesmen, including many prominent chieftains. The invitation was a ruse, and upon their arrival to the palace, the tribesmen were surrounded and ambushed by Mansur and his ghilmƒÅn. Those Kilabi tribesmen who were not massacred were thrown into the dungeons of Aleppo's citadel. To gain their freedom, Muqallid ibn Za'ida, a Kilabi chieftain who did not attend the banquet, rallied his tribal forces and placed pressure on Mansur by besieging Kafartab, south of Aleppo. Mansur subsequently decided to show good faith by moving the Kilabi prisoners to better facilities and giving particularly favourable treatment to Muqallid's brothers, Jami' and Hamid.Zakkar 1971, pp. 49‚Äì50. However, Mansur shortly after rescinded these good faith measures following Muqallid's death at Kafartab and the dispersal of his tribesmen.Zakkar 1971, p. 50. Mansur executed several Kilabi chieftains in captivity, and tortured others, while many died from the poor conditions they were kept in. The contemporary Aleppine historian, Yahya al-Antaki, wrote that Mansur managed to induce some Kilabi chieftains to accept his terms, and released a small group of tribesmen in 1013. =Relations with the Fatimids= During his father's lifetime, Mansur developed good relations with Caliph al-Hakim. As early as 1007, he sent his two sons to Cairo, where al-Hakim granted them a large amount of money and seven villages in Palestine.Zakkar 1971, p. 45. Moreover, al-Hakim bestowed on Mansur the title of murta·∏çƒÅ al-dawla (\\"approved of the Dynasty\\" or \\"content of the State\\").Canard 1986, p. 130. Though relations deteriorated in 1011, by 1014 Mansur resumed friendly ties with al-Hakim. In March 1014, al- Hakim sent Mansur a diploma recognizing Mansur's authority in Aleppo. Mansur was the first emir of Aleppo to accept the suzerainty, even if nominal, of the Fatimid Caliphate, as opposed to Mansur's predecessors, who nominally recognized the supremacy of the Abbasid Caliphate. It is not known when exactly Mansur paid formal allegiance to the Fatimids. Mansur maintained Aleppo's Shia Muslim orientation, in line with the Fatimids, and had the khu·π≠ba (Friday prayer sermon) made in the name of al-Hakim.Amabe 2016, p. 64. =Struggle with Salih ibn Mirdas= Among Mansur's Kilabi prisoners was Salih ibn Mirdas, the emir of al-Rahba. Mansur tortured and humiliated Salih in captivity and forced Salih to divorce his wife Tarud so that Mansur could wed her; Tarud was well known for her beauty, and according to historian Thierry Bianquis, was \\"the most beautiful woman of the age\\". According to Zakkar, it is not clear if Mansur did this solely to humiliate Salih and enjoy his wife, or to form a marital link with part of the Kilab.Zakkar 1971, p. 51. On 3 July 1014, Salih managed to escape the citadel and rejoin his tribesmen at Marj Dabiq, north of Aleppo.Zakkar 1971, p. 52. While contemporary Aleppine chronicles hold that Salih escaped through acrobatic means, Mansur later accused the governor of the citadel, Fath al-Qal'i, of collusion with Salih. Salih quickly gained the allegiance of the entire body of Kilab, who were in awe of his escape, and moved against Aleppo. Mansur's ghilmƒÅn staved off Salih's forces at Aleppo's outskirts, encouraging Mansur to assemble a larger army composed of his ghilmƒÅn, craftsmen from the suq and men from Aleppo's lower-class neighbourhoods, including many Christians and Jews.Zakkar 1971, pp. 52‚Äì53.Amabe 2016, p. 60. On 13 August, Salih routed the Aleppine force, killing some 2,000 of Mansur's soldiers, and capturing Mansur and his senior commanders.Zakkar 1971, p. 53. Two of Mansur's brothers escaped the Kilabi onslaught and returned to Aleppo, where they maintained order in the city with assistance from their mother. Salih attempted and failed to capture the city, and negotiations for Mansur's release were initiated between Salih and Mansur's representatives, mediated by Aleppine dignitaries. An agreement was soon reached which saw Mansur released in return for several overtures to Salih and the Kilab; among the overtures was the return of Salih's wife Tarud, a daughter of Mansur's for Salih to wed, the release of all Kilabi prisoners, a ransom of 50,000 gold dinars, recognition of Salih's authority over the Kilab, and the assignment of half of the Emirate of Aleppo's revenues to Salih. While Mansur fulfilled some parts of the agreement, he ultimately refused to give Salih his daughter and the promised share of Aleppo's revenues.Zakkar 1971, p. 54. In retaliation against Mansur's reneging on their deal, Salih attacked Aleppo and prevented movement into and out of the city.Zakkar 1971, pp. 54‚Äì55. This caused severe hardship for its inhabitants and Mansur was unable to challenge the Kilab alone.Zakkar 1971, p. 55. He thus appealed for support from Basil II, warning him that the Bedouin uprising was bound to harm the Byzantine Empire. Basil II agreed and dispatched 1,000 Armenian soldiers to assist Mansur, but they were soon after withdrawn when Salih convinced Basil II of Mansur's treachery and promised the emperor of his goodwill toward him. Basil II may have actually withdrawn his men to avoid antagonizing the Kilab or, more importantly, the Kilab's Numayrid kinsmen and allies, who posed a more immediate threat to Byzantine territory. In any case, Mansur's position was further weakened as a consequence. =Ouster= Zakkar asserts that Mansur's conflict with the Kilab ultimately led to his collapse, but the \\"fatal blow to Mansur's rule came when he disputed with his ghulƒÅm Fath al-Qal'i, the governor of Aleppo's citadel\\".Zakkar 1971, pp. 55‚Äì56. Mansur pinned the blame for his troubles with the Kilab on Fath, whom he accused of conniving with Salih. Mansur did not have the power to forcibly remove Fath; instead, he attempted to set a trap against Fath, inviting the latter to meet him outside the citadel.Zakkar 1971, p. 56. Fath caught wind of Mansur's intrigues, locked the gates of the citadel and opened a rebellion against Mansur. On 7 January 1016, Fath recognized Salih's rule, an act which took Mansur by surprise. Having falsely believed that Fath handed over the citadel to Salih, Mansur fled Aleppo that night with his sons, brothers and a few of his ghilmƒÅn. Disorder spread throughout Aleppo the morning after Mansur's flight. Aleppines looted Mansur's palace, taking some 80,000 gold dinars-worth of property. The medieval Aleppine chronicler Ibn al-Adim further noted that 28,000 volumes of manuscripts stored in the palace library were lost. A number of Christian and Jewish homes were also plundered. Though actual members of the Hamdanid dynasty had lost power by 1002, many contemporary Arabic chroniclers consider Mansur's ouster to represent the formal end of the Hamdanid emirate. Service with Byzantines Mansur reached Byzantine-held Antioch two days after his flight, and Basil II ordered the catepan of that city to give him an honorable reception;Cheynet 2003, p. 87. providing refuge to former rulers of Aleppo was a common Byzantine practice because such ex-rulers could be used to pressure or threaten their successors. In his rush to escape Aleppo, Mansur left behind his mother, wives and daughters, who were detained by Fath, then transferred to Salih's custody.Zakkar 1971, p. 57. Salih then had Mansur's womenfolk safely returned to him in Antioch, with the exception of one of Mansur's daughters, whom Salih wed per his previous agreement with Mansur. Basil II accorded Mansur the fief of Shih al-Laylun (Loulon) near the Byzantine‚ÄìArab frontier. According to historian Jean-Claude Cheynet, this fief could not have been the frontier fortress of Loulon, but rather a group of villages from which Mansur received his income during his asylum in Antioch.Cheynet 2006, p. 6, n. 20. Mansur later built a fortress in his fief. Basil II also granted Mansur a building in Antioch itself.Cheynet 2003, p. 81. Mansur received a salary and he and his men served in the Byzantine army of Antioch, where he commanded a tagma (professional regiment) of 700 men. He was in the entourage of Emperor Romanos III at the Battle of Azaz in 1030, which was fought against Salih's son and successor, Shibl al-Dawla Nasr.Canard 1986, pp. 130‚Äì131. Mansur's presence likely indicates Romanos's intention to restore Mansur to Aleppo, according to Zakkar, though the attempt ended in a decisive Byzantine defeat.Zakkar 1971, p. 111.

She is also a transgender woman, having transitioned from life as Robert to Bobbi after undergoing gender reassignment surgery in 2010. She attempted to qualify for the LPGA Tour in 2013 and her efforts garnered international media attention. Early life Bobbi Lancaster was born Robert Douglas Lancaster on June 23, 1950 in Chatham, Ontario, Canada. Her father, Douglas Lorne Lancaster, was a high school graduate and World War II U.S. paratrooper and later worked for Revenue Canada. He died in 1984. Bobbi's mother, Rosalie Clara Lancaster was a farmer's daughter. At the age of fourteen, she finished formal education and worked in a garment factory making uniforms for the military. She married Douglas in 1948. Bobbi was the first of four children. The family lived in Chatham until 1956 and then moved to Ridgetown, a small town in southwestern Ontario farm country. Young Bobbi was an excellent student who excelled at all sports, delivered newspapers, studied butterflies, served mass as a Catholic altar boy and learned to play the piano. She was introduced to golf by her father, an excellent player, who was on the Board of Ridgetown Golf and Curling Club. The Lancasters moved to Hamilton, Ontario in 1960 where Bobbi continued piano studies with the Royal Conservatory of Music and caddied. She became caddy champion at Hamilton Golf and C.C. at fourteen years of age and attended Cathedral Boys High School where she was taught by Jesuit priests. Bobbi dreamed of being a professional golfer, a biologist, a pianist or perhaps a priest. Struggles Lancaster liked to cross-dress by wearing her cousin's dresses when they were not around and felt like a girl from the age of four or five. She hid these feelings from others because she knew she was different and had observed how badly others around her were treated because they were different. Her father was an abusive alcoholic who never knew of her struggles. At fourteen, Lancaster finally told a trusted parish priest about her desire to be a girl. She was told her thoughts and her cross-dressing were sinful. This news cemented Bobbi's decision to hide and she remained \\"closeted\\" until sixty years of age. She lived with a constant yearning to just live as the woman she knew herself to be. This led to depression and a near suicide in her fifties and ultimately culminated in the transition to life as Bobbi. Medical career She was an Ontario Scholar and received an academic scholarship to McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario where she studied honors Biology (1969-1972). She received an Honor M for academic excellence and captained the men's varsity golf team to two OUAA Championships (1972 and 1974) She was accepted to McMaster Medical School in 1972 and ultimately was awarded an M.D. degree in 1978. She completed her family medicine residency in 1980 during which time she was elected Chief Resident. Lancaster passed her board certification and practiced in Hamilton until 1991. She provided obstetrical care, looked after children, assisted in surgery, attended hospitalized patients, made house calls and provided medical care for all age groups. She served as an assistant clinical professor from 1981 to 1991 where she taught medical students and residents. Lancaster was nominated as Canadian Family Practice Teacher of the Year in 1986. She served on many hospital committees and volunteered in the community. Most notably she served as a Board of Director for the Hamilton Catholic Children's Aid Society and became president in 1984. In 1991, Lancaster moved to Phoenix, Arizona where she became American Board Certified, established a family practice and continued to teach interns and residents at St. Joseph's Hospital. She took a leave of absence from practice in 2001 because she was struggling with depression and gender identity difficulties. During that time she volunteered at the Phoenix Art Museum, Phoenix Zoo and Boyce Thompson Arboretum. Lancaster resumed her medical career and ultimately became medical director of Advanced Healthcare of Mesa and Scottsdale (medical-surgical rehabilitation facilities). She also became a medical director with Hospice of the Valley. She ultimately lost these positions during her gender transition in 2012. Lancaster then provided medical supervision of modified barium swallow studies (2012-2016) while she maintained her small concierge family practice in Gold Canyon, Arizona (2001 to present). She is a revered clinician and patients back in Hamilton, Ontario still wish she would return to care for them. Golf career She graduated from Cathedral Boys High School in 1969 as one of the top students. She had captained the varsity golf team and had participated on the track and field team. She high jumped six feet in a city meet. Bobbi also participated in soccer, hockey and the chess club. Lancaster excelled at golf from a young age, winning the prestigious caddy championship at Hamilton Golf and C.C. in her early teens. At 11, she won a caddie tournament at the club, beating peers who were in their late teens. She also qualified for the Ontario Caddy Championship. During high school she captained the Cathedral Boys varsity team to multiple victories. She also won junior tournaments, interclub matches representing Chedoke Civic Golf Course and was victorious as a member of the CANUSA Games golf team. In her late teens and twenties, Bobbi won multiple club championships at Chedoke. She also qualified and competed in several Canadian and Ontario Amateur Championships as well as the Ontario Open, a professional event. Bobbi also captained the McMaster University Men's Varsity Golf Team to two OUAA Championships (1972 and 1974). When she began her medical career in 1980, Lancaster joined Hamilton Golf and C.C. where she quickly became club champion and three-time Sclater Bowl champion. She successfully represented the club in interclub and Somerville Matches. Upon moving to Phoenix, she competed on the Western States Tour in 1997 and won a professional event at Palm Valley Golf Course. After moving to Gold Canyon, she became Senior Club Champion at Superstition Mountain Golf Club in 2008. After Lancaster's transition in 2012 and her unexpected unemployment and free time, she took up golf with renewed enthusiasm. She received permission from the USGA to compete as a female and promptly won the Papago Club Championship against some of the best players in Arizona. After several more victories, there were complaints that her prior status as a male gave her an unfair advantage around strength and distance. Bobbi basically handicapped herself and became a professional golfer in 2013. She competed on the Cactus Tour against elite players forty years younger. She enjoyed modest success and was instrumental in changing the Cactus Tour's female-at-birth gender policy. Bobbi then attempted to qualify for the LPGA Tour, under their new transgender policy, and competed in the LPGA Qualifying Tournament in 2013. She failed in her attempt but did gain conditional status on the Symetra Tour. Various life events curtailed her golf adventures (see Media and Advocacy below) and she regained her amateur status in 2016. Bobbi still competes occasionally and represented Papago Golf Course in interclub matches in 2017. She is also once again their club champion. Media When Lancaster became a professional golfer and attempted to qualify for the LPGA Tour at sixty three years of age, her story garnered international media attention. It started after Paola Boivin (senior sports columnist for the Arizona Republic) received a complaint from a fan about how inappropriate it was to see her playing on the Cactus Tour. This resulted in a full-length feature about her golf dreams, her personal life and her work as a physician. The story was picked up nationally and Boivin was nominated for a Sports Emmy. Following that article, stories appeared in the Canadian newspapers, Huffington Post, USA Today, Good Morning America, Canadian Medical Post. Bobbi agreed to interviews with TMZ Sports, Channel 12 News, New Times weekly newspaper, McMaster Times Alumnae magazine, Echo magazine, Freedom for All Americans and The League of Fans. There was a documentary that appeared on national television produced by the Golf Channel (interview conducted by multiple Emmy Award-winner Jimmy Roberts). There were also documentaries exploring Bobbi's life by Cronkite News, Sports Illustrated (golf.com) and the Human Rights Campaign (Arizona). Advocacy As a result of the media attention, Lancaster has become a minor celebrity. She has been asked to give educational and motivational speeches to various groups including students at the University of Kansas, Arizona State University, Chandler and Gilbert Community Colleges, Stanford School of Law and McMaster School of Medicine. She has also given speeches to Phoenix Valley Leadership, the Arizona Women Lawyers Convention in Tucson, the Performing Artists Medical Association International Symposium (NYC 2016). Dr. Bobbi's efforts promoting awareness of transgender issues caught the attention of the Human Rights Campaign. She was awarded their 2015 Equality Award at a gala in Phoenix in 2015 where her famous Humpty Dumpty acceptance speech can be found on YouTube. She was elected to their national Board of Directors in 2016. She has worked tirelessly on their behalf, lobbying on Capitol Hill and at the Arizona State Capitol.

In 2015, the Rockefeller Foundation and The Lancet launched the concept as the Rockefeller Foundation‚ÄìLancet Commission on Planetary Health. History The idea of planetary health has been around for some time. In 1993 the Norwegian physician Per Fugelli wrote: \\"The patient Earth is sick. Global environmental disruptions can have serious consequences for human health. It's time for doctors to give a world diagnosis and advise on treatment.\\" Twenty-one years later, a commentary in the March 2014 issue of the medical journal The Lancet called to create a movement for planetary health to transform the field of public health, which has traditionally focused on the health of human populations without necessarily considering the surrounding natural ecosystems. The proposal recognized the emerging threats to natural and human-made systems that support humanity. In 2015, the Rockefeller Foundation and The Lancet launched the concept as the Rockefeller Foundation‚ÄìLancet Commission on Planetary Health. Definition Drawing from the definition of health ‚Äì \\"a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\\" \\\\- as well as principles articulated in the preamble of the constitution of the World Health Organization, the report elaborated that planetary health refers to the \\"achievement of the highest attainable standard of health, wellbeing, and equity worldwide through judicious attention to the human systems ‚Äì political, economic, and social ‚Äì that shape the future of humanity and the Earth's natural systems that define the safe environmental limits within which humanity can flourish.\\" Principles The Lancet Commission's report laid down the overarching principles guiding the idea of planetary health. One is that human health depends on \\"flourishing natural systems and the wise stewardship of those natural systems\\". Human activities, such as energy generation and food production, have led to substantial global effect on the Earth's systems, prompting scientists to refer to the modern times as the anthropocene. A group of Earth system and environmental scientists led by Johan Rockstr√∂m from the Stockholm Resilience Centre proposed the concept of nine planetary boundaries within which humanity can continue to develop and thrive for generations to come. According to a 2015 update, four of the planetary boundaries ‚Äì climate change, biosphere integrity, biogeochemical flows, and land-system change ‚Äì had already been exceeded. The report concluded that urgent and transformative actions are needed to protect present and future generations. One important area which required immediate attention was the system of governance and organization of human knowledge, which was deemed inadequate to address the threats to planetary health. The report made several overarching recommendations. One was to improve governance to aid the integration of social, economic, and environmental policies and for the creation, synthesis, and application of interdisciplinary knowledge. The authors called for solutions based on the redefinition of prosperity to focus on the enhancement of quality of life and delivery of improved health for all, together with respect for the integrity of natural systems. Comparison with other fields Planetary health is considered a response to existing fields and paradigms such as public health environmental health, ecohealth, One Health and international health. While there may be competing definitions of global health, it is loosely defined as the health of populations in a global context, a response to the cross-border movement of health drivers as well as risks, and an improvement over the older concept of international health with its new emphasis on achieving equity in health among all people. The editor in chief of The Lancet Richard Horton wrote in a 2014 special issue of The Economist on planetary health, that global health was no longer able to truly meet the demands which societies face, as it was still too narrow to explain and illuminate some pressing challenges.\\"Global health does not fully take into account the natural foundation on which humans live ‚Äì the planet itself. Nor does it factor in the force and fragility of human civilizations.\\" Judith Rodin, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, declared planetary health as a new discipline in global health. Issues Planetary health concerns itself with governance and stewardship which pose a threat to the sustainability of the human civilization, environment, and planet. Specifically, it seeks to confront three main types of challenges: \\"imagination challenges\\", such as failing to account for long-term human or environmental consequences of human progress; \\"research and information challenges\\", such as underfunding and lack of scope in research; and \\"governance challenges\\", such as delayed environmental action by governing bodies determined by unwillingness, uncertainty, or non-cooperation. A primary ethical focus of planetary health research is human cooperation and non-cooperation in the form of conflict, nationalism, and competition. As one goal, the Lancet Commission on Health and Climate Change plans to use an accountability mechanism to track human cooperation and study the link between health, climate, and political action. Likewise, nutrition and diet are important contributors to and indicators of planetary health. Scientists speculate that human population growth threatens the carrying capacity of the planet. Diets, agriculture, and technology must adjust to sustain population projections upwards of 9 billion while reducing harmful consequences on the environment through food waste and carbon- intensive diets. A focus of planetary health research will be nutritional solutions that are sustainable for the human species and the environment, and the generation of scientific research and political will to create and implement desired solutions. Planetary health aims to seek out further solutions to global human and environmental sustainability through collaboration and research across all sectors, including the economy, energy, agriculture, water, and health. Biodiversity loss, exposure to pollutants, climate change, and fuel consumption are all issues that threaten human and climate health alike, and are, as such, foci of the field. A number of researchers think that it is actually humanity's destruction of biodiversity and the invasion of wild landscapes that creates the conditions for new diseases such as Covid-19. Developments since 2015 In December 2015, Harvard University, together with the Wildlife Conservation Society and other partner organizations, founded the Planetary Health Alliance to promote the concept. Funded by Rockefeller Foundation and housed in Harvard, the Alliance aims to support the development of \\"rigorous, policy-focused, transdisciplinary field of applied research aimed at understanding and addressing the human health implications of accelerating change in the structure and function of Earth's natural systems.\\" The Alliance's initiatives include the Rockefeller Foundation Planetary Health Fellowship, a planetary health course for Harvard undergraduates, and a Planetary Health Annual Meeting, which was first held in April 2017 in Boston, MA.

It has rough, tessellated bark on the trunk and branches, lance-shaped or curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven and barrel-shaped, urn-shaped or shortened spherical fruit. Description Corymbia leptoloma is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has thick, rough, grey-yellow, tessellated to flaky bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have glossy green leaves that are paler on the lower surface, egg-shaped to lance-shaped, long, wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are dark glossy green on the upper surface, much paler below, lance-shaped to curved, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with seven buds that are sessile or on pedicels up to long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a flattened to rounded operculum, sometimes with a central knob. The fruit is a woody barrel-shaped, urn-shaped or shortened spherical capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit. Corymbia leichhardtii sometimes occurs in the same vicinity and can be distinguished from C. leptoloma by its dull leaves that are a similar colour on both sides. Taxonomy and naming Yellowjacket was first formally described in 1991 by Ian Brooker and Anthony Bean in the journal Austrobaileya, and was given the name Eucalyptus leptoloma from specimens Brooker collected near Paluma in 1989. In 1995, Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson changed the name to Corymbia leptoloma. Distribution and habitat Corymbia leptoloma is only known from a small area north west of Townsville where it is found in remnant areas of wet sclerophyll forest in association with Syncarpia glomulifera, Eucalyptus resinifera and Corymbia intermedia in gullies or on hillsides. It grows in coarse sandy soils derived from granite. Conservation status This eucalypt is classified as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the Queensland Government Nature Conservation Act 1992. The main threats to the species are habitat destruction and disturbance due to agriculture, mining and timber harvesting.

Born in Austria, he moved to England in 1935, where he became naturalised in 1946. Early and private life Charoux was born in Vienna. His father Josef Kinich was a civil engineer who had served in the Austro-Hungarian Army. His mother Anna Buchta (n√©e Charous) was a dressmaker. She had Czech ancestry, and was the widow of Johann Buchta. He was given the name Siegfried Buchta at birth, and was renamed Siegfried Charous in 1914 after his mother's maiden name. He changed the spelling to Charoux in 1926, at the time of his marriage to Margarethe Treibl (1895 - 1985). They had no children. He attended schools in Vienna, and was conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian Army in early 1915. His right hand was wounded in the First World War, with nerve damage causing paralysis, and he left the army due to his wounds in 1917. He regained use of his right arm after a successful surgical operation. Career in Vienna He studied privately under . He was rejected by the Vienna School of Applied Arts (Hochschule f√ºr angewandte Kunst), but attended the Vienna Academy (Akademie der Bildenden K√ºnste), under , from 1922 to 1924. He was a political cartoonist from about 1923 to about 1933, using the pseudonym \\"Chat Roux\\". His cartoons were published in the Arbeiter-Zeitung and other left-wing journals. He shifted to sculpture, opening his own studio in 1926, and made memorials in Vienna to Robert Blum (1927) and Matteotti (1929). In 1930 he won an international competition to create a memorial statue to Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, erected in Judenplatz in 1935. (The statue was removed by the Nazi regime after 1939 and destroyed. After the Second World War, Charoux was commissioned to replace the lost memorial with a bronze copy, which was unveiled in 1968, the year after his death, at in Vienna; it was moved back to Judenplatz in 1981.) Career in England Life became difficult for Charoux in Austria due to his left-wing political views, and he moved to England in September 1935. He was interned on the Isle of Man as an enemy alien during the Second World War, but became naturalized as a British subject in November 1946. He made a memorial bust of Amy Johnson in 1944, displayed at the Ferens Art Gallery in Hull. He did stone carvings for the School of Anatomy and the Engineering Laboratory at Cambridge University in 1948. His work was also part of the sculpture event in the art competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics. His terracotta statue Youth: Standing Boy (1948) - built using an Etruscan technique in layers without an armature - was bought by the Tate Gallery in 1948, using funds from the Chantrey Bequest. The Tate also holds his statue of Civilisation: The Judge (1962), made for the Royal Courts of Justice in the Strand as part of a series of six sculptures, the others including Cellist for the Royal Festival Hall, Motorcyclist for the Shell Building on the South Bank, Violinist, and Survivor.Siegfried Charoux, Youth exhibited 1948, Tate GallerySiegfried Charoux, Civilization: The Judge, 1962, Tate Gallery He also contributed to open-air exhibitions of sculptures held at Battersea Park in 1948, 1951, 1954, and 1960, and at Holland Park in 1957.

She was furthermore the only contemporary female physician in France, except for Martinette, who was permitted to treat the poor of Dijon.

Soto signed with the Nationals as an international free agent in 2015. He made his MLB debut in 2018. Early life and family Soto was born in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, to Juan Soto, Sr. and Belkis Pacheco. He has an older sister and younger brother. His father, a salesman, was a catcher in a local men's league and encouraged his son to make baseball his passion. Career =Minor leagues= Soto signed with the Washington Nationals as an international free agent in July 2015. He made his professional debut in 2016 with the Gulf Coast League Nationals in the rookie-level Gulf Coast League and was named the Gulf Coast League MVP after hitting .368 with five home runs and 32 runs batted in (RBIs). In September 2016 he was promoted to the Auburn Doubledays of the Class A-Short Season New York-Penn League for the final few games of the 2016 season. Appearing in six games for the Doubledays, he went 9-for-21 (.429) with three doubles and an RBI. He finished the 2016 season with an overall batting average of .368, five home runs, and 32 RBIs. Promoted to play with the Hagerstown Suns of the Class A South Atlantic League in 2017, Soto got off to a hot start before injuring his ankle while sliding into home in a game on May 2 and landing on the disabled list. At the time of his injury, he was batting .360 with three home runs in 23 games with the Suns. In July 2017, MLB Pipeline ranked Soto the Nationals' second-best prospect and the 42nd-best among all prospects. Soto did not return to the Suns in 2017, but he had two rehabilitation stints with the Gulf Coast Nationals, one of five games in July 2017 and a second one of four games in September 2017 before injuring his hamstring and finally being shut down for the season. In those nine games with the Gulf Coast League Nationals, he went 8-for-25 (.320) with a double, a triple, and four RBIs, and finished the 2017 season with a batting average of .351, three home runs, and 18 RBIs. Soto entered 2018 as one of the minor leagues' top prospects. He started the season with the Hagerstown Suns, hitting .373 in 16 games with five home runs and 24 RBIs, before being promoted early in the season to the Potomac Nationals in the Class A-Advanced Carolina League. After 15 games with Potomac, in which he hit .371 with seven home runs and 18 RBIs, he was promoted to play with the Harrisburg Senators in the Class AA Eastern League. He had appeared in eight games for the Senators, going 10-for-31 (.323) with two doubles, two home runs, and 10 RBIs, when on May 20, 2018, the Washington Nationals called him up to the major leagues for the first time to reinforce their outfield after an injury to second baseman and outfielder Howie Kendrick. =Washington Nationals=  2018 season  Soto made his major-league debut on May 20, 2018, becoming the youngest player in the major leagues at 19 years, 207 days, and the first player born in 1998 to appear in a major-league game. He came on as a pinch-hitter in the eighth inning of a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., and struck out swinging against right-handed relief pitcher Erik Goeddel. Soto made his first major-league start the next day, playing left field in a game against the San Diego Padres at Nationals Park, and on the first pitch of his first plate appearance of the game, got his first major-league hit, a opposite-field three-run homer off of Robbie Erlin. After rounding the bases and returning to the dugout, Soto stepped back out for a curtain call from the crowd. He became the youngest player in franchise history to hit a home run and the first teenager to homer in a major-league game since Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper did it at age 19 in 2012. \\"He's a special player,\\" Harper said of Soto after the game. Soto became the youngest major league player since Ken Griffey Jr. in 1989 to be intentionally walked in a game when Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter elected to do so rather than give him an opportunity to drive in a run on May 29. On June 2018, shortly after being called up to the major leagues, Baseball America listed Soto as the Nationals' top prospect, overtaking fellow outfielder V√≠ctor Robles, and the fourth-best overall prospect in baseball. Soto contributed to a notable oddity when he hit a home run against the New York Yankees on June 18, 2018. The contest began on May 15, 2018, but was suspended until June 18 due to inclement weather with the score at 3‚Äì3. Since the stoppage occurred in the fifth inning, a team would have been awarded the win if they were ahead, which implied that he had technically hit a home run before his MLB debut. To prevent confusion, it was added in sequence to his already accrued home run total as his sixth home run. He had hit three home runs in his first five plate appearances against the Yankees. On June 21, he started as the cleanup hitter for the first time in the major leagues, against the Baltimore Orioles. He doubled home the winning run in a 4‚Äì2 victory. Soto's first multi-home run game came on June 13, 2018, against the New York Yankees, and he repeated the feat on June 29, 2018, at Citizens Bank Park against the Philadelphia Phillies, tallying two home runs, four hits, and five RBIs as the Nationals defeated the Phillies 17‚Äì7.https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/jun/29/juan-soto-nationals- play-longball/ Soto had another multi-home run game against the Phillies on September 11, 2018, going 3-for-4 with four RBIs in the second game of a doubleheader. In 2018, he batted a slash line of .292/.406/.517 with 79 walks (10th in the NL), 22 home runs, and 70 RBIs in 414 at-bats, and was the youngest player in the NL. He finished second in voting for NL Rookie of the Year.  2019 season  Soto at the Nationals Victory Parade in 2019 On August 19, 2019, Soto became only the fourth player in MLB history to record 100 extra-base hits before his 21st birthday, joining Mel Ott, Tony Conigliaro, and his former teammate, Bryce Harper. He later became the seventh MLB player in history to reach 30 home runs before their 21st birthday. In 2019, he batted .282/.401/.548 with 110 runs (7th), 108 walks (3rd), 34 home runs, and 110 RBIs (9th) as he stole 12 bases in 13 attempts and was the 4th- youngest player in the NL. With the Nationals trailing the Milwaukee Brewers 3‚Äì1 in the bottom of the eighth during the NL Wild Card Game, Soto hit a bases-clearing single off of Brewers closer Josh Hader to give the Nationals a 4-3 lead. They would later hang on to the lead and advance to the National League Division Series. On October 9, 2019, in the decisive Game 5 of the NLDS, Soto hit a game-tying home run in the top of the 8th off Clayton Kershaw. The Nationals eventually won the game (7‚Äì3) and series against the Dodgers. On October 23, 2019, playing in Game 1 of his first World Series, Soto hit a home run off of Astros' ace Gerrit Cole to start the fourth inning and became the fourth youngest player in MLB history to ever hit a home run in a World Series. On October 25, 2019, Soto played in a World Series on his birthday, an event his father predicted about 10 years earlier. It was Soto's 21st birthday and Game 3 of the World Series.https://www.lavidabaseball.com/game-1-world-series-juan-soto-father/ The Nationals eventually won the World Series, their first in franchise history, and Soto batted .277/.373/.554 with 5 home runs and 14 RBIs in the postseason (.333/.438/.741 with 3 HR, 7 RBIs in the World Series). For the series, he led the Nationals in home runs, hits, walks and runs scored. Soto was later named the co-winner (with Stephen Strasburg) of the 2019 Babe Ruth Award. He also made the All-MLB Second Team for the season in an annual honor rolled out in 2019.  2020 season: Batting champion  On July 23, 2020, just before the opening game of a shortened 2020 season, it was announced that Soto had tested positive for COVID-19. Soto returned to action on August 4 after multiple negative tests; he told The Washington Post that he had been following team rules for social distancing before the positive test, never experienced COVID-19 symptoms, received negative results on three rapid-result tests the day he learned of the positive test result through the official MLB testing program, and believed the result that caused him to miss time was a false positive. In a series at Citi Field against the division-rival New York Mets, Soto first hit a home run on August 10, the longest of his career, then another home run measured at on August 12 to set a new personal best. He was named National League Player of the Week on August 17, his first such honor. Despite losing the first week of play to the positive COVID-19 test and missing some time in September with an elbow injury, Soto qualified for the batting title and became the youngest player in National League history to win, hitting .351 during the regular season. Soto also led all qualified hitters in MLB in on-base percentage (.490), slugging percentage (.695), and on-base plus slugging (1.185), posting the highest marks in those three categories for any major league hitter with at least 195 plate appearances in a season since Barry Bonds in the 2004 season. In spite of Soto's achievement, the Nationals were unable to capitalize, missing the playoffs even with an expanded format. Playing style The Soto Shuffle in 2020 During his 2018 rookie season, Soto became known for his movements and adjustments in the batter's box between pitches. Dubbed the \\"Soto Shuffle\\", the routine includes Soto swinging his hips, wiping the dirt with a wide arc of his leg, pulling at his crotch, and lowering himself into a squat and staring down the pitcher. As an ESPN writer describes it: \\"He'll swing his hips or spread his legs or sweep his feet or shimmy his shoulders or lick his lips or squeeze his, um, junk, sometimes all at once\\". Soto says he started the routine in the minor leagues \\"to get in the minds of the pitchers, because sometimes they get scared\\". In Game 1 of the 2019 National League Championship Series, St. Louis Cardinals pitcher Miles Mikolas responded to Soto's antics by grabbing his own crotch after retiring Soto on a ground out. Soto responded later by saying, \\"He got me out, he can do whatever he wants.\\" Soto employs a \\"two-strike approach\\" in which he raises his grip along the bat handle and adopts a wider, lower stance, sometimes described as a crouch, in the batter's box. He is noted for his ability to drive the ball to all fields, even on a two-strike count. At the conclusion of his 2020 season, Soto had hit 69 career home runs in MLB and divided them evenly by direction: 23 to left field, 23 to center field, and 23 to right field. Although he was a finalist for a Gold Glove Award as a left fielder after the 2019 season, Soto has indicated a preference for playing right field, his main position during his brief minor league career. The Nationals began deploying him as their starting right fielder late in the 2020 season. International career On October 29, 2018, he was selected to the MLB All-Stars Team for the 2018 MLB Japan All-Star Series.

Minnesota was won by the Republican Party candidate, incumbent President Dwight D. Eisenhower won the state over former Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson by a margin of 101,777 votes, or 7.6%. Eisenhower went on to win the election nationally, with 457 electoral votes and a landslide 15.4% lead over Stevenson in the popular vote. The 1956 presidential election was a rematch of the 1952 election, in which Eisenhower also defeated Stevenson, both nationally and in Minnesota. , this is the last time Minnesota was carried twice by the Republican nominee. The Democratic nomination campaign leading into 1956 presidential election may have had a major role in the end of the political career of Coya Knutson, the first woman to be elected to the United States House of Representatives from Minnesota. The Minnesota Democratic- Farmer-Labor Party, in a ploy to win a possible vice presidential nomination for its rising star, U.S. Senator Hubert Humphrey, desperately attempted to ensure that Stevenson would win in the DFL Presidential Primary in Minnesota that year. However, Congresswoman Knutson, believing that the agricultural policy positions of U.S. Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee would have been more beneficial to her constituents, instead endorsed and campaigned on behalf of Kefauver. In part due to Knutson's efforts, Kefauver won the March 20th Minnesota Presidential Primary; as a result, when Stevenson was ultimately nominated, Kefauver was chosen as his running mate. Two years later, shortly before the 1958 DFL state convention, a letter signed but not written by Knutson's husband was circulated to reporters. The contents of the letter played on anxieties over deviations from the rigid gender roles of the time, and its publication by newspapers essentially ensured Knutson's defeat in her bid for re-election that year. It has been alleged by several individuals, including Concordia College political science professor Harding Noblitt, Knutson biographer Gretchen Beito, and numerous people who were close to Knutson, that either DFL state leadership or local operatives wrote the letter and bribed Knutson's husband to sign it, as a means to exact retribution against the Congresswoman for denying Humphrey a shot at the vice presidential nomination in 1956.

Description Leucopogon affinis is an erect, often bushy shrub which grows to a height of , sometimes with its youngest branches having a covering of tiny hairs. Its leaves are lance-shaped, elliptic or egg-shaped, long, wide. They are almost stalkless, have a narrow base, a pointed tip, fine striations on the lower surface and the edges sometimes have fine teeth near the tip. The flowers are arranged in spikes on the ends of the branches and in the upper leaf axils. The spikes are long and contain between 2 and 16 tube- shaped white flowers. The flower tube is long with 5 pointed lobes that are densely hairy inside. The base of the tube is surrounded by narrow, egg-shaped sepals that are long. Flowering occurs from August to October and is followed by glabrous, edible, oval-shaped, reddish-orange fruit about long.L. affinis growing near Wollomombi FallsMount Imlay Taxonomy and naming Leucopogon affinis was first formally described by Robert Brown in 1810 and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae.

He was the founder and leader of the Septeto Matancero for over 50 years, and the author of many famous sones such as \\"Engancha carretero\\". Throughout his long career Oviedo only recorded a handful of sessions, mostly for American record labels. He has been called \\"one of the greatest Cuban tres players\\" by other musicians such as Efra√≠n R√≠os and Pancho Amat. According to the latter, Oviedo was the pioneering and most influential tresero of the septeto format (the major type of son ensemble of the 1920s and '30s). His technical innovations include the alzap√∫a thumb stroke and the use of the pinky finger. His son Ernesto played in his band since the 1940s and became a successful bolero singer, while his other son Gilberto, known as Papi Oviedo, has also had a long career as a tresero, playing with Conjunto Chappott√≠n, Estrellas de Chocolate and Orquesta Rev√©.  Life and career  Isaac Oviedo was born on July 6, 1902 in the village of Sabanilla del Encomendador (now known as Juan Gualberto G√≥mez) in the municipality of Uni√≥n de Reyes, Matanzas, Cuba. His family was poor and his mother worked as a sugarcane cutter. From an early age he taught himself to play the guitar. At age 11 he learned to play the tres from a musician from Santiago de Cuba who had relocated to Matanzas after the War of Independence.Roots of Rhythm. New York, NY: New Video Group [NVG-9476], 2001. By his late teens he was playing in Pepito L√≥pez's orchestra, and also formed his own band, Los Unionenses. He played at the Sauto Theater, and in 1922 founded the Sexteto Matancero alongside guitarist Julio Gov√≠n. He then took his group to Havana in 1926, as many other rural artists were doing at the time. Between 1926 and 1928 he played at various bars and cabarets in Marianao, the most touristic seaside neighbourhood of Havana. In this period Graciano G√≥mez joined the band on guitar and Barbarito D√≠ez became the lead singer. With them, the Sexteto Matancero held its first recording sessions on February 7, 1928, for Victor. They recorded \\"Engancha carretero\\", Oviedo's most successful and critically acclaimed song, noted for its creole character. In 1929, Oviedo toured Puerto Rico with G√≥mez co-directing the Quinteto T√≠pico G√≥mez-Oviedo.Amador (2005) p. 99. During their stay, Oviedo taught Guillermo \\"Piliche\\" Ayala how to play the tres, thus becoming the first Puerto Rican tres player. Back in Havana the Sexteto Matancero became a septeto with the addition of cornettist Seraf√≠n Terry and recorded four songs in June 1930 for Brunswick. Oviedo, G√≥mez and D√≠ez continued playing together with a varying lineup (cuarteto, quinteto, sexteto, etc.). The Quinteto T√≠pico became the Quinteto Selecto, and in 1941 they recorded a single for Victor as Cuarteto Selecto. The association between Oviedo and G√≥mez under various names (Matancero, T√≠pico, Selecto) lasted until the early 1970s, when G√≥mez retired. Oviedo continued to perform, recording an album for Areito in 1984. Between 1962 and 1968, Oviedo performed with Los Tutankam√©n, a live band organized by Alfredo Gonz√°lez Suazo \\"Sirique\\" at his pe√±a.Veitia, H√©ctor (1966). La Herrer√≠a de Sirique [film]. Havana, Cuba. Despite his lasting impact in the music of Cuba, and to a lesser extent Puerto Rico, Oviedo remained virtually unknown to international audiences until 1989, when he was featured in the Latin music documentary Routes of Rhythm, presented by Harry Belafonte, which explored the historical development of some Afro-Cuban musical traditions. The documentary, filmed in 1984, was broadcast by PBS and accompanied by the release of three CDs. While Oviedo appears only in one track on each of the first two volumes (released in 1990), the final volume (released in 1992) consists entirely of his music. The \\"rediscovery\\" of Oviedo's music was however followed by his death on June 16, 1992, aged 89. The documentary was released on DVD in 2001 under the title Roots of Rhythm.  Style and technique  Oviedo is considered one of the earliest innovators of the tres, developing a series of techniques that increased tha timbral and melodic possibilities of the instrument. Most importantly, he pioneered the thumb stroke known as alzap√∫a (a technique already used by mandolinists and nowadays common in flamenco),Amador (2005) p. 43. as well as the use of the pinky finger. Although sometimes described as \\"traditionalist\\" in comparison to treseros from later decades,Sublette (2004) p. 572. Oviedo is considered the first virtuoso of the tres due to his varied and complex style, which was imitated by many. Oviedo's preferred tuning was that of a D-major chord, A‚ÄìD‚ÄìF#, the same that Arsenio Rodr√≠guez would use years later.Sublette (2004) p. 338.

She was the daughter and granddaughter of missionaries who later took it upon herself to continue in the family business. Allen worked primarily with the Universities' Mission to Central Africa (which would later become the United Mission to Central Africa) in their hospitals at Mkunazini and Zanzibar. Allen was the director of the hospital in Mkunazini. Though she was mainly concerned with the health of the people she served, she helped them in many other ways as well. She was a leader who pushed for the education of the women and children of the areas where she worked. She founded the Zenana Mission in Zanzibar through the UMCA. The main goal of the Universities' Mission to Central Africa (UMCA) was evangelistic. They were an Anglo-Catholic organization and they brought their religious beliefs to the people of Africa. She was one of the most important missionaries of the time because she endured so much hardship, helped so many people, and overcame the difficulty that came with being a woman at the time. Work with the ill and injured The Universities' Mission to Central Africa was founded in 1860 at the request of \\"the great David Livingston.\\" It was originally a mission for the people around Lake Nyassa, but it quickly grew. The main goal of the mission was always evangelistic but they also spent a lot of time bringing education and healthcare to the people of the region. Although Allen worked on all three major aspects of this mission, she was a medical missionary first and foremost. She came to Mkunazini alongside Bishop Steere and twenty other workers on 11 February 1875. Of these twenty workers, Allen was put in charge of the hospital. She was helped by only two other nurses. They were horribly understaffed and it was up to Allen to pick up the slack. Her work was not confined to the hospital. The bishop would travel to nearby villages to spread the gospel and give advice. Allen accompanied him on these trips and would tend to the medical needs of the growing crowds. Allen continued working in Mkunazini for the next 10 years and faced a variety of difficulties. The hospital was subject to flood and war. This made it even more difficult for Allen to do her important medical work. In August 1888 she, along with Sister Agnes, Sister Anne Margaret, Sister Mary Elizabeth, and Mr. Gill, journeyed to Maglia. They traveled by donkey for over a week before reaching their destination. They had been in Maglia less than a month when tragedy struck. On November 5 the Great Fire hit the mission in Maglia. Many structures were lost including many houses and half the newly built hospital. Allen, as the only doctor in the village at the time, had to care for all the injuries sustained in the fire. In addition to these burns, she had to cure the rampant illness that occurred as a result of living so close together during the rainy season. The patients she dealt with were especially on-edge because war in the region was seeming more and more inevitable. On 6 January 1889, another fire ravaged the mission at Maglia. Six weeks later, on 18 February, a tornado hit the village and did substantial damage to the newly rebuilt hospital. The rain that came after the tornado damaged what remained of the hospital. The downpour caused mud from the roof to coat everything below. Then, on 27 February, the war between Kimweri and Kibanga came to Maglia. The village was plagued by 400 Masai, the \\"most warlike and invincible tribe in Central Africa.\\" This war lasted until 7 March, when Archdeacon Farier made peace with Kimweri. Allen continued to care for the people of Maglia through these tumultuous times. Evangelistic work with women and children Allen did not only help people medically. She also was an integral part of many Zenana Missions. In 1878 she started one such mission in Zanzibar. She worked extensively with the people of Zanzibar and considered it her home. She recruited Miss Hinton, and the two women used the mission to spread Christianity. Hinton helped run the Mission's nursery because, \\"the nation comes from the nursery\\" where there can be \\"a firm foothold for Christianity.\\" The two women spent a lot of time with the children of Zanzibar making sure they had a proper Christian education. Allen also visited the mothers to read Bible stories. She was especially successful in converting these Muslim women by pointing out the many similarities between their religion and the Genesis stories in the Bible. She employed the same technique when she later worked with the Copts of Cairo. The Copts, though they were \\"descendants of the ancient Christians of Egypt,\\" had changed a lot. The Church Mission Society (CMS) was especially concerned with how superstitious the Copts had become. She was not as successful with converting this group. Like many Zenana Missions, Allen's later became less evangelistic and more focused on educating women and young girls. One of the skills she taught them was sewing. She gave them the skills and materials necessary to mend their own clothes, thereby making them more self-sufficient. In a letter detailing her 1906 trip to Yinege, Allen details some of the other skills and values they taught women. She remarks that she was impressed by their \\"lady like manner and neat dress.\\" She also was very happy to report that the women seemed receptive toward Christianity. In all of her years as a Zenanan missionary, these were the characteristics she expected to see in women who were served by similar establishments.

Ali won the series 2‚Äì1, though the final fight (judged a unanimous decision in Ali's favor) was highly controversial and disputed by many, including Ali himself. First match Still rebuilding a winning record after his first professional loss to Joe Frazier, Ali faced Norton on March 31, 1973, at the Sports Arena, San Diego, California. The fight was aired live on free TV in the United States via ABC. The fight against Norton started a years-long rivalry. Ali was outmaneuvered by Norton's unorthodox fighting style, which involved jabbing from below and crossing his hands for defence. As the final bell rang, Norton won on a split decision, igniting a controversy in the boxing world. Soon after the fight, Ali was treated in hospital for a broken jaw, an injury sustained in the first round of the fight. Second match On September 10, 1973, Ali and Norton met at the Forum, Inglewood, California, USA, for their highly anticipated rematch. Norton was in superb shape going into the second fight while Ali took to training at his training camp in Deer Lake, Pennsylvania, where he \\"sought to whip his once Adonis-like physique back into shape.\\" As the fight began, both Ali and Norton appeared in shape and energetic. However, Ali demonstrated his physical stamina by skipping without pause and standing between rounds. Norton came out aggressively in the beginning of the fifth round, leading with a barrage of jabs and pushing Ali to a more defensive posture. In the final round, Ali dominated with a series of combinations. Though the match was close, Ali ended up winning the split with 2 votes to 1. Although Ali had demonstrated the physical stamina for which he had become known, he admitted, \\"I'm tireder than usual, because of my age.\\" Third match Ali and Norton met for the third and last time on September 28, 1976, at Yankee Stadium, Bronx, New York, USA, completing their trilogy. This time, 34-year-old Ali entered the ring as Heavyweight Champion. Both fighters showed their strengths, but neither established themselves as the obvious winner. Most commentators gave the fight to Norton. Ultimately, Ali won by a unanimous decision, thereby retaining his title. Ali said during an interview with Mark Cronin in October of 1976: \\"Kenny‚Äôs style is too difficult for me. I can‚Äôt beat him, and I sure don‚Äôt want to fight him again. I honestly thought he beat me in Yankee Stadium, but the judges gave it to me, and I‚Äôm grateful to them.\\" Norton was bitter, stating after the fight: \\"I won at least nine or ten rounds. I was robbed.\\"BoxRec: Norton vs Ali 3 Overall, Ali landed 199 of 709 punches while Norton landed 286 of 635 punches, per Bob Canobbio's CompuBox statistics. Norton both landed more punches and had far better accuracy (45% vs 28%). Norton also landed 192 power punches to Ali's 128.\\"Ali-Norton III: Who Really Won?\\". Wall Street Journal.

It aired on November 2, 2016, on the cable network FX. The episode was written by Todd Kubrak and directed by Gwyneth Horder-Payton. Plot After Dominic and Shelby witness Agnes' murder by the Butcher, the colonists' ghosts surround the house and start their attack. Shelby and Dominic try to escape through the basement's passageway but it is infested by the Chen family's ghosts who attack them. The other ghosts resurface in the house and attack, severely injuring both Shelby and Dominic in the process. The two are forced to hide inside the bedroom's bathroom but Shelby could no longer handle her guilt after murdering Matt and commits suicide. At their family compound, the Polks continue torturing Lee, Audrey, and Monet as retribution for kidnapping their grandchildren. Mama and her reluctant son Jether then begin to butcher flesh from Lee's leg. The matriarch then explains that the Polks first resorted to cannibalism with a group of pig thieves as their first victims during the Great Depression. The son cuts off Lee's right ear, detailing another family tradition of presenting pickled ears as gifts during Christmas. After Mama leaves Jether to watch over Lee, Lee commiserates with him, insisting that he is being treated by his family as inept, and they are denying giving him the fame and attention that he desires. Jether, who showed an interest in Lee without any intent to kill her, refuses and explains that he will never live up to his ancestor Kincaid Polk who emulated the Piggy Man and murdered several people at the Chicago World‚Äôs Fair back in 1893 which gave way to an urban legend thereafter. After refusing his offer of drugs to her; Lee demands Jether to explain more of the Polk's family tradition and in case of her impending fate, requested to record her last message to her daughter Flora on camera. In her message, Lee confesses that she did murder her ex-husband Mason out of resentment at his primary custody of Flora. Afterwards, Lee takes advantage of her freedom by seducing Jether, who had released her restraints, and incapacitates and kills him by stabbing him in the neck with a knife. Meanwhile, Audrey and Monet tried to explain the truth behind the loss of the feral children to the Polks but they do not believe their explanations and begin pulling out each of the actresses' teeth to craft necklaces as family sacramentals. As they are commencing to take Monet's teeth, her chair breaks and she fights back and manages to escape out of the compound as Ishmael and Lot chases after her into the woods while Mama continued to rip out Audrey's teeth. Lee arrives and knocks out the Polk matriarch from behind with a hammer. As Mama Polk regains consciousness, Audrey grabs the hammer from Lee and repeatedly bludgeons Mama's head, killing her. By the time Lee and Audrey return to the farmhouse through its secret passageway to the basement, the former brakes down in tears at the sight of her brother's mutilated corpse. In the upstairs bedroom, Audrey tries to comfort Lee while nursing her back to health. The former enters the bathroom to fetch some water and is horrified to see Shelby's dead body. When Dominic tries to explain what happened, a fierce argument erupts among the three of them during which a grief-stricken Lee locks Dominic out of the bedroom in the hallway, holding him responsible for the deaths of her brother and sister-in- law, where he is then murdered by the Piggy Man. The next morning, Lee convinces Audrey that they have to go back to the Polk family compound to retrieve the video evidence of their torture by the Polks as proof of their story. Despite Audrey's protests, they agree to do so but just as they approach the front door to leave, they are confronted by a person dressed in a Piggy Man costume who turns out to be Dylan, the re-enactor who portrayed Ambrose White, much to the women's surprise.

Behind the plaza exists a grassy space suitable for picnics and enjoying the sun on a warm day. The play area consists of stumps to jump on as well as a slide made out of Goshen stone. Other unique features include planters and other features made of rusty steel, serving as a nod to Northampton's industrial past. Still another environmentally friendly feature that was added to the park was a stormwater garden consisting of plants that absorb rainwater and naturally treat it before being carried into the storm drainage system. The park was named after Polish military leader Casimir Pulaski. A bus stop that serves several routes on the Pioneer Valley Transit Authority (PVTA), including several routes leading to University of Massachusetts Amherst, is also located there.  Renovations  The park, last renovated in 1976, fell into a state of disrepair and neglect. In addition, the park was dominated by concrete and lacked open green spaces. In 2014, a plan was adopted to renovate the existing park to make it more inviting to the public. Construction on the first phase started in late 2015. On July 22nd, 2016, the park reopened with a grand ceremony. The new incarnation of the park was themed around nature. Phase II of the park renovation consists of the expansion of the park, improving connections to the adjacent Roundhouse Parking Lot and the New Haven-Northampton Rail.

History Pelt was born in Copenhagen, the son of Hans Peter Pelt (died 1715) and Dorothea Kellinghusen (died 1732). In 1708, his father, who was originally from the Netherlands, obtained a license to establish Copenhagen's second sugar refinery. The sugar refineries were generally the most successful industrial enterprises in the country at the time. Pelt inherited a thriving sugar refinery business. It was originally located in Christianshavn but moved to Gammeltorv after the Copenhagen Fire of 1728. Pelt was active in the Danish Asiatic Company and served as a bank commissioner at Kurantbanken in 1759-74. Personal life On 18 November 1743, Pelt married Maria Elisabeth Mushardt (13 3 May 1725 In Kristiania - 1 2 February 1760 in Copenhagen) in Church of Our Saviour. She was a daughter of later Major- General Christian Eberhardt M (died 1732). They had one child, a son, Peter Pelt, who died in 1770. Abraham Pelt died in 1783. He is buried in St. Peter's Church. The sugar refinery, which had by then moved to a site next to the Exchange Dock, was taken over by Pelt's associated Hinrich Ladiges (1731-1805). He was also the owner of a sugar refinery in Nabol√∏s. Pelts Stiftelse Commemorative plaque Larslejsstr√¶de 7: The building from 1899 In 1779, having no longer any living heirs, Pelt established a home for 16 elderly men and women, Pelts Plejestiftelse (or Den Peltske Stiftelse), which was located in Larslejsstr√¶de, adjacent to two similar institutions. One had been operated by St. peter's Church while the other, Thymes Stiftelse, had been established by Winand Thyme in 1775. They were later merged under the name Skt. Petri kirkes, Thymes og Pelts plejestiftelse. It was destroyed in the British bombardment of Copenhagen in 1807 but a new and larger building was completed after the war. A new building (Larslejsstr√¶de 7) was built in 1899 to design by the architect Frederik Lecy. It was built as part of a larger complex which also comprised new precises for the Herman congregation's Sankt Petri Schule. The new building contained 38 one-room apartments as well as various residences for people associated with the school, congregation or church. Most of the residents were German expatriate women. In 1997, the building was sold to the school which needed more space for its increasing number of students.

Minnesota was won by the Republican candidate, former Supreme Allied Commander Europe General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower won the state over Illinois governor Adlai Stevenson by a margin of 154,753 votes, or 11.22%. Eisenhower went on to win the election nationally, with 442 electoral votes and a commanding 10.9% lead over Stevenson in the popular vote. Incumbent President Harry S. Truman was the last President who was unaffected by the term limit imposed under the 22nd Amendment, but decided as early as 1950 that he would not seek another term. Eisenhower was the first Republican presidential nominee to win Minnesota (which had otherwise normally been a Democratic stronghold) since the Stock Market Crash of 1929, and the first Republican elected to the presidency since Herbert Hoover left office in 1933 and the first to win Minnesota since Hoover in 1928. Until the 2016 presidential election, this was the last time that the state was more Republican than the national average. This was also the last time Swift County voted Republican until 2016. On March 18, 1952, Minnesota held a Presidential Primary for the first time since 1916.

His father was a tailor, and he was the fourth son. In 1923, twelve year old Matvey organized a drama club in Saratov called \\"Revolutionary Theater\\" and staged his first production \\"Robin Hood\\". In the early years of 1930 Dubrovin spent time in Leningrad. For a while he studied at the Faculty of Philology of Saint Petersburg State University. Then he entered the Russian State Institute of Performing Arts to major in directing. Before the war he was an assistant director of Vsevolod Meyerhold for the production of \\"The Queen of Spades\\" in the Small State Opera House. Starting from 1939, Dubrovin helped the war effort for Russia during war. At the beginning of Finnish War he directed the propaganda team. After severe concussion he was sent to the evacuation city of Khorog, located on the \\"top of the world\\" (Pamir Mountains). There he organized the first Musical Theatre in Tajikistan.Khorog State Music and Drama Theater. Mehrubon Nazarova It was during this time he developed the idea of a theater in which \\"everyone would be happy ...\\", that later he embodied in TYUT. =Leningrad period (children's drama club)= After he returned to Leningrad in 1947, Dubrovin began to teach four different children's drama groups (drama club at the House of Cinema, drama in DK (cultural house) Kirov, drama club in the Moika Palace, drama in the Palace of Pioneers. Working with children became the main purpose of his life. From the Cinema House came out such wonderful actors as Margarita Volodina and Lidiya Fedoseyeva-Shukshina. =Leningrad period (TYUT)= The busiest time of Anichkov Palace, came in the middle of the 1950s, at the time of thaw . In 1956, Dubrovin starts to lead Theater of Youth Creativity (main children's theater group in Leningrad), which brings together participants of all previously created, children's drama clubs. November 10, 1956 TYUT opens its season with the play by Mikhail Svetlov, After Twenty Years. Among the first students of TYUT are Evgeny Sazonov, Lev Dodin and Sergei Solovyov. =Matvey Dubrovin's Circle= Theatre School TYUT, established in 1956 was built on the principle of the Matvey Dubrovin's Circle.\\"The Circle of Matvey Dubrovin\\" EY Sazonov. ‚Äì SPb. : Balt. Seasons, 2006 The typical \\"professional\\" theater of the time was managed with a defined hierarchy, where at the top were the director and the actors, and at the bottom were all of the theater's workshops: costume designers, make-up, props, and lighting. Dubrovin moved away from this model and created a Circle, where all of the theatrical professions worked cohesively towards a path to a performance, resulting in common labor of all of the participants. Each participant chose a theatrical profession according to their own taste, then trained in that profession. This way, all participants contributed to the creation of the performance. This helped keep children grounded and away from the \\"star\\" fever. It is difficult to become conceited if today you act on stage, but tomorrow you are behind the scenes helping your friends. At the head of each department stands a leader, who helps the workshop teacher. Lessons in one of the workshops are mandatory for the Studio. Thus, the participants get the skills of the theatrical professions and are prepared to work on their own TYUT performances.  Cultural workers and students of Matvey Dubrovin  The monument at the grave of Matvey Dubrovin with the inscription ¬´From TYUT's childhood¬ª Lev Dodin: \\"I think his idea was bigger than professional theater by itself, or at least of the theater of that era -. He was the spirit ‚Äì the prophet, the teacher in the Biblical sense of the word ‚Äì Preacher\\" . \\"Matvey Dubrovin was a terrific demiurge. Once we were working on the play \\" The secret is in the suitcase\\", with the second teacher, very smart, informative. We rehearsed it and it was very serious, but boring. Suddenly Dubrovin came in and began to disassemble the play and was able to show WHAT that play can become. He was the boss for us, but suddenly he grabbed a chair, pulled the table, jumped up on the table, picked up the chair and began to swing it ... We rolled down with laughter.

The Privy Council did not answer the question asked by the High Court, and the court never issued another certificate of appeal. Background The Commonwealth established a Royal Commission to inquire into the sugar industry in Australia. Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd operated sugar mills and refineries, principally in Australia and Fiji. The Royal Commission had summoned the general manager and directors of Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd to testify and produce documents, including a list of documents to be produced and questions they would be asked. Colonial Sugar Refining Co Ltd sought a declaration in the High Court that the Royal Commissions Act 1902-1912 was invalid. as amended by the The decision of the High Court In separate judgments, each of the judges upheld the validity of the Royal Commission Act. What split the court however was the question of whether the Royal Commission could inquire into matters that might be the subject of an amendment to the Constitution. =Griffith CJ & Barton J= In separate judgments, Griffith CJ & Barton J took a narrow view of the powers of the Royal Commission, applying the reserved powers doctrine. Their Honours held that the Commission could not lawfully ask questions, or demand the production of documents, relevant solely to: * The internal management of the affairs of the company; * The operations of the company outside the Commonwealth, except in so far as they related to the conditions of carrying on the sugar industry irrespective of the persons by whom it was carried on; * Matters relating to the value of particular parts of the property of the company, except such parts as were actually and directly employed in the production and manufacture of sugar within the Commonwealth; * Details of salaries paid to officers of the company, except so far as they were relevant to the actual cost of such production and manufacture. =Isaacs & Higgins JJ= In separate judgments, Isaacs & Higgins JJ took a much broader view of the incidental power under the Constitution to make inquiries with a view to the exercise of any other functions of the Commonwealth, including the power to seek approval for an amendment of the constitution. =The certificate= Section 74 of the constitution provided that > No appeal shall be permitted to the Queen in Council from a decision of the > High Court upon any question, howsoever arising, as to the limits inter se > of the Constitutional powers of the Commonwealth and those of any State or > States, or as to the limits inter se of the Constitutional powers of any two > or more States, unless the High Court shall certify that the question is one > which ought to be determined by Her Majesty in Council. The High Court may > so certify if satisfied that for any special reason the certificate should > be granted, and thereupon an appeal shall lie to Her Majesty in Council on > the question without further leave. Except as provided in this section, this > Constitution shall not impair any right which the Queen may be pleased to > exercise by virtue of Her Royal prerogative to grant special leave of appeal > from the High Court to Her Majesty in Council. The Parliament may make laws > limiting the matters in which such leave may be asked, but proposed laws > containing any such limitation shall be reserved by the Governor-General for > Her Majesty's pleasure. Because the High Court was equally divided in opinion, it granted a certificate pursuant to section 74 of the Constitution in the following form: > Pursuant to sec. 74 of the Constitution this Court doth certify that, so far > as the question whether the Parliament of the Commonwealth has power to make > laws for the compulsory examination of witnesses by Royal Commissions > touching matters which are not within the ambit of the existing legislative > powers of the Commonwealth, that is to say, such powers as may now be > exercised without an amendment of the Constitution under the provisions of > sec. 128, is a question as to the limits inter se of the constitutional > powers of the Commonwealth and those of any State or States, the question is > one which ought to be determined by His Majesty in Council. The decision of the Privy Council The Privy Council did not answer the question posed by the High Court, whether a Royal Commission could inquire into matters that might be the subject of an amendment to the Constitution. Instead the Privy Council held that, contrary to the decision of all four of the judges of the High Court, the Royal Commission Act, was invalid so far as it purported to enable a Royal Commission to compel answers generally to questions, or to order the production of documents.; . Significance In 1918 Prime Minister Hughes described the decision of the Privy Council as one \\"which must have caused great embarrassment and confusion, if it were not for the fortunate fact that the reasons for the Judicial Committee's decision are stated in such a way that no court and no counsel in Australia has yet been able to find out what they were\\". The High Court never certified another inter se appeal. In Whitehouse v Queensland the court said: \\"experience shows - and that experience was anticipated when s. 74 was enacted - that it is only those who dwell under a Federal Constitution who can become adequately qualified to interpret and apply its provisions.\\". In the case of Kirmani v Captain Cook Cruises Pty Ltd (1985), the High Court went further holding that it would never again grant a certificate of appeal, stating \\"Although the jurisdiction to grant a certificate stands in the Constitution, such limited purpose as it had has long since been spent. The march of events and the legislative changes that have been effected - to say nothing of national sentiment - have made the jurisdiction obsolete.\\". This declaration by the Court and the provisions of the Australia Act 1986 by both the UK Parliament. and the Parliament of Australia (with the request and consent of the Australian States) have for practical purposes ended all means of appeal from Australian courts to the Privy Council.

On 6 April 1941, less than two weeks after Yugoslavia had signed onto the Tripartite Pact, the Axis invaded Yugoslavia. By 18 April, the country was conquered and occupied by the Axis powers. Background Political map of Europe at the end of October 1940 (in German). Political map of Europe at the end of March 1941 (in German). Prince Paul of Yugoslavia. After the French armistice in June 1940, only the United Kingdom seemed to have any chance of winning a fight against the Germans, with even it having a greater chance of negotiating a humiliating peace. Thus, the historian Vladislav Sotiroviƒá wrote that \\"no wonder British politicians and diplomats tried by all means, including military coups, to drag any neutral country into war on their side for a final victory against Hitler's Germany\\". Yugoslavia had been ruled as a dictatorship by the regent, Prince Paul, since the assassination of King Alexander I in 1934. After the 1938 Anschluss, the German annexation of Austria; the 1939 Italian occupation of Albania; and the accession of Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria to the Tripartite Pact from 20 November 1940 to 1 March 1941, Yugoslavia was bordered by Axis powers on all sides except the southern border with Greece. All of those factors, combined with traditional Croatian separatism, caused Paul to be in a great psychological, political and patriotic dilemma in March 1941 on how to resist Hitler's diplomatic pressures and concrete political offers to sign Yugoslavia's accession to the pact. He was unable to stall since Hitler was in a hurry to start the Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Also, the potential of Croatian betrayal during a German invasion was the Berlin's main argument during its negotiations with Belgrade. In the spring of 1941, Yugoslavia could rely only on Britain, which had more economic and population resources than Germany because of its colonies in the British Empire. Yugoslavia needed quick military aid, which Britain could offer, if the former rejected the pact. Paul was pro-British and himself a relative of British King George VI. Since Paul gave the impression that he would rather resign than turn his back on Britain, Hitler viewed him as a British puppet in the Balkans. There was also the perceived risk of a communist fifth column because of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, which made General Milan Nediƒá prepare a plan in December 1940 to open six internment camps for communists if it was necessary. Nediƒá also proposed for the Yugoslav Army to take Thessaloniki before Italian troops could do so after the November 1940 Italian invasion of Greece since the loss of that port would make eventual British military aid impossible if Yugoslavia was invaded. The Greeks, however, held firm against the Italians and even entered Albania, where the Italian invasion had begun. Nediƒá's plan for the communists was uncovered by a spy, the young officer ≈Ωivadin Simiƒá, in the War Ministry; he copied the two-page document, which was then quickly handed out in Belgrade by the communists. It was crucial for Hitler to solve the questions of Yugoslavia and Greece before he attacked the Soviet Union since he believed that Britain, which was, along with France, at war with Germany, would accept peace only when the Soviets could no longer threaten Germany. (London held the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact as dishonest, volatile and forced by the foreign situation.) The invasion of the Soviet Union needed the Balkans to be pro- German, and the only unreliable countries in the region were Yugoslavia, the Serbs being traditional enemies of Germany, and Greece, which had been invaded by Italy on its own accord after the German annexation of Austria, but it became clear that Benito Mussolini could not manage in Greece on his own. The British Army in Continental Europe was successfully fighting only in Greece. The military and political elimination of Greece and Yugoslavia, as potential British allies, would thus be extremely serious for Britain. Seven German divisions were thus moved into Bulgaria, and permission for six divisions to cross Yugoslavia into Greece was sought by Paul. On 1 March 1941, Hitler compelled Paul to visit him personally in his favourite resort, in Berchtesgaden. They secretly met in Berghof, Hitler's residence, on 4 March. In an extremely uncomfortable discussion for Paul, Hitler said that after he would expel British troops from Greece, he would invade the Soviet Union in the summer to destroy bolshevism. Yugoslav historiography is mostly silent about the fact that Hitler offered Paul someone of the latter's Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá dynasty to become the emperor of Russia. That was hinted to be Paul himself, whose his regency mandate would end on 6 September 1941, when Peter II would become an adult and thus the legitimate king of Yugoslavia. However, the offer, which was more imaginary than realistic, was not crucial in influencing Paul's decision to accede to the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941 since it was Realpolitik that was the ultimate factor. Paul had first addressed British diplomatic circles in Belgrade and London to urge help and protection, but Britain offered no military aid to Yugoslavia, despite doing so for Greece. The British sought for a Yugoslav military engagement against Germany, which was then defeating Britain, and promised an adequate reward after their victory. During the negotiations with Hitler, Paul feared that London would demand a formal public declaration of friendship with Britain that would only anger Germany but bring no good. Concrete British aid was out of the question, especially since Yugoslavia had bordered Germany since the annexation of Austria. The Yugoslav Army was inadequately armed and so would not stand a chance against Germany, which had won the Battle of France only a year earlier. On 12 January 1941, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill informed Paul that Yugoslav neutrality was not enough. The German and British demands thus differed enormously since the Germans sought only neutrality and a nonaggression pact, but the British demanded open conflict. On 6 March, Yugoslav War Minister Petar Pe≈°iƒá, despite being supported by the British since he was anti-German, laid out the slim chances of Yugoslavia against Germany. He stressed that the Germans would quickly take over the northern Yugoslavia with Belgrade, Zagreb and Ljubljana and then force the Yugoslav Army to retreat into the Herzegovinian Mountains, where the army could hold out for no more than six weeks before it surrendered since there were not enough weapons, ammunition and food. Accordingly, the next day, Dragi≈°a Cvetkoviƒá sent his demands to the German embassy in Belgrade: the respect of the political sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, the rejection of military aid from or the transport of troops across Yugoslavia during the war and the taking into consideration of the country's interest for an access on the Aegean Sea during the postwar political reorganisation of Europe. Negotiations =November 1940= On 28 November 1940, Yugoslav Foreign Minister Aleksandar Cincar-Markoviƒá met with Hitler at Berghof. Hitler spoke of his plans of the \\"consolidation of Europe\\" and called for the conclusion of a nonaggression pact with Germany and Italy. Although the Yugoslav government agreed, Hitler immediately answered that it was not enough by not meeting the need for the improvement of relations with the Axis powers, and the question of Yugoslavia's accession to the Tripartite Pact needed to be discussed. =February 1941= On 14 February 1941, Prime Minister Dragi≈°a Cvetkoviƒá and Foreign Minister Cincar-Markoviƒá met with Hitler, who insisted on a quick decision on accession since it was \\"Yugoslavia's last chance\\". Hitler had modified his demands by making special concessions to Yugoslavia that would include nothing \\"contrary to her military traditions and her national honour\\". Hitler did not demand the passage of troops, the use of railways, the installation of military bases or military collaboration with Yugoslavia and guaranteed its national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Finally, Hitler said, \\"What I am proposing to you is not in fact the Tripartite Pact\\". The Yugoslavs, however, managed to refuse and to delay the negotiations by noting that the decision lay in Prince Paul. =4 March 1941= On 4 March 1941, Prince Paul secretly met with Hitler at Berghof, where no obligations were taken, and Paul noted that he needed to consult with his advisers and government. Hitler had offered concrete guarantees and told Paul that the accession would have \\"a purely formal character\\". =6‚Äì14 March 1941= Aleksandar Cincar-Markoviƒá On 6 March, the Crown Council was summoned, and Prince Paul informed of Hitler's demand for accession. Cincar-Markoviƒá presented the foreign situation and the problems related to Yugoslav accession, and Pe≈°iƒá portrayed the poor military situation. It was generally concluded from the discussions that accession would occur but that certain limitations and reserves were be demanded from Germany, with Cincar-Markoviƒá in charge of drafting those points, which would be held in highest secrecy. The conference showed that the question of accession was very serious and, with respect to public opinion, very difficult.Viktor von HeerenThe next day, Cincar-Markoviƒá called Viktor von Heeren, the German minister in Belgrade, to the ministry and informed him of the Crown Council had agreed to Hitler's wish for Yugoslav accession to the pact. Simultaneously, an uneasiness, sparked by anti-Yugoslav manifestations and the negative articles in the media in Bulgaria in recent days, came to the fore. Then, Ribbentrop was asked to clarify through Heeren whether Yugoslavia would receive a written statement from Germany and Italy if it acceded that Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial integrity would be respected; that no Yugoslav military aid would be requested and, during the creation of a new order in Europe, that the Yugoslav interest in free access to the Aegean Sea through Thessaloniki would be considered. Cincar-Markoviƒá noted while he presented those points that there had already been a consensus on all questions. He then informed Paul that Ribbentrop had offered written guarantees. To clarify the situation, Cincar-Markoviƒá again asked for a precise answer from the German government to confirm those questions, which would help the Yugoslav government to implement the desired policy. On 8 March, Heeren strictly confidentially contacted the German ministry. He stated that he had a strong impression that Yugoslavia had already decided that it would soon join the pact if the Germans either fulfilled the demands presented by Cincar-Markoviƒá or only slightly amended the German-Italian written statements. Heeren believed that Ribbentrop's incentive for another discussion with Paul was very appropriate and would be best held at the Brdo Castle, near Kranj. In Belgrade's political and military circles, joining the German camp was generally discussed, but the thought that it would come in stages, with the help of government statements, prevailed and that by not acceding the pact would spare the population's hostile mood. The same day that Heeren contacted Ribbentrop about the latter's instructions, Heeren decided to see Cincar-Markoviƒá to state immediately that the German- Italian response to all three points had been positive. Heeren then warned Cincar-Markoviƒá the situation made it seem that it was in the best interest for Yugoslavia to decide on its accession as fast as possible. On 9 March, continuing his phone conversation, Ribbentrop stated to Heeren from Fuschl am See that Germany was ready to recognise its respect of Yugoslav sovereignty and territorial integrity in a special note, which could be publicised by the Yugoslav government. The Germans were ready to promise that no request on passage or transfer of troops would be made to Yugoslavia during the war, which could be publicised if the Yugoslav government thought that internal politics made it necessary. That and the announcement's timing could be discussed during the pact's conclusion. =20‚Äì24 March 1941= On 20 March, three Yugoslav ministers (Branko ƒåubriloviƒá, Mihailo Konstantinoviƒá and Srƒëan Budisavljeviƒá) resigned in protest. After consultations with British and American ministers, the Crown Council decided that the military situation was hopeless and voted 15‚Äì3 in favour of accession. Signing Dragi≈°a Cvetkoviƒá. Joachim von Ribbentrop. On 25 March, the pact was signed at the Belvedere, in Vienna, the main signatories being Ribbentrop and Cvetkoviƒá. An official banquet was held, which Hitler complained felt like a funeral party. The German side had accepted the demands that had been made by Paul and Cvetkoviƒá although both had actually hoped that Hitler would not accept them so that they could prolong the negotiations. The agreement stated that Germany would respect the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and that the Axis powers would neither seek permission to transport troops across Yugoslavia nor request any military assistance. The Yugoslav ambassador to Germany, Ivo Andriƒá, better known for being a writer, transcribed the document. German radio later announced that \\"the Axis Powers would not demand the right of passage of troops or war materials\\" although the official document mentioned only troops and omitted any mention of war materials. Likewise, no pledge to consider giving Thessalonika to Yugoslavia appeared in the document. Aftermath =Demonstrations= The day after the signing of the pact, demonstrators gathered on the streets of Belgrade and shouted, \\"Better the grave than a slave, better a war than the pact\\" (). =Coup d'√©tat= Belgraders demonstrate their support for breaking with the Tripartite Pact on 27 March, during the Yugoslav coup d'√©tat. On March 27, the regime was overthrown in a coup d'√©tat that had British support. King Peter II was declared to be of age despite being only 17. The new Yugoslav government, under Prime Minister and General Du≈°an Simoviƒá, refused to ratify Yugoslavia's signing of the Tripartite Pact and started negotiations with the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. The enraged Hitler issued Directive 25 as an answer to the coup and attacked both Yugoslavia and Greece on April 6. The German Air Force bombed Belgrade for three days and nights. German ground troops moved in, and Yugoslavia surrendered on April 17. =Legacy= In September 1945, the State Commission of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Paul a \\"criminal\\", one reason being that he had caused Yugoslavia to join the Tripartite Pact. Serbia rehabilitated him on 14 December 2011.

Kavanagh was the creator of Canada Reads, an annual \\"battle of the books\\" competition which was first broadcast on CBC Radio in 2002. Kavanagh first conceived of the idea for what would become Canada Reads after learning of a similar program on public radio in the United States. On the Canada Reads program, five prominent Canadians, known as \\"advocates,\\" each select a book. CBC Radio listeners then choose the winner. Past winners of the competition have included Michael Ondaatje, Joseph Boyden and Kim Th√∫y. Kavanagh was a co-producer on the first season of Canada Reads before leaving the show to pursue other CBC projects. Kavanagh was born in Deep River, Ontario, on June 12, 1953, as the third of five children of Cyril and Thelma Kavanagh. He contracted paralytic poliomyelitis when he was just two months old and spent much of his early infancy and childhood as a patient at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. He endured medical procedures and surgeries throughout his life. When he was 60-years old, Kavanagh underwent a surgery to lengthen one of his legs, making both legs the same length for the first time. As a result of the operation, he had to learn how to walk again. He documented his experience in his memoir, The Man Who Learned to Walk Three Times, which was published in 2013. Kavanagh retired from the CBC in 2013. Peter Kavanagh died of a heart attack on September 7, 2016, at the age of 63. He was survived by his wife, Debi Goodwin, and their daughter, Jane.

However, on the same day the North Korean army invades South Korea outbreaking the Second Korean War. Meanwhile, the Chinese government see an opportunity to threaten Japan in the amidst of the confusion Sakuragi now has to resolve. Publication The writer Yoshiki Hidaka, a famous political analyst of Japan‚ÄìUnited States relations, worked along with illustrator Ryuji Tsugihara in The First President of Japan. The seinen manga was published on Bart magazine of the publisher Shueisha between 1998 and 2000. In Japan it was first published in tank≈çbon format through a single omnibus edition in December 1998. Then a new edition of three volumes was published through the Super Playboy Comics label from December 1999 to April 2000. An American edition was published by Gutsoon! Entertainment on its magazine Raijin Comics, starting from the second issue in January 2003. The graphic novel version had four volumes that were published between July 9, 2003 and January 6, 2004. A spin-off series, also written by Hidaka, but this time illustrated by Kenji Yoshida, was published under the name . Serialized in Shinchosha's magazine Weekly Comic Bunch, it spawned sixteen tank≈çbon published between November 9, 2003 and September 8, 2006. Reception John Jakala from Anime News Network (ANN) was surprised by its first chapter because of the absence of on-screen appearance of the main character on it. He considered it \\"a daring move\\" but said \\"it pays off: I found myself anxious to meet Sakuragi, and curious to see how he will deal with all of the political crises erupting around him.\\" However, Jakala affirmed the first actual appearance of Sakuragi probably would be more impactful if his face had not been shown on a Jumbotron at the end of the chapter. \\"Still, it was a cute bit\\", he said. The third chapter had \\"a very powerful\\" scene about the formation of a lifelong friendship between Sakuragi and a childhood's friend. Jakala deemed it \\"inspirational without becoming overly sentimental\\". On the other hand, he criticized the \\"'excited' word balloons\\" in uppercase that seem to be shouting at him as \\"painfully purple\\". In the end, Jakala said that \\"certain situations or lines seem a bit too melodramatic, but overall the series maintains an engaging tone\\". About its tone, Greg McElhatton of Read About Comics stated it \\"feature[s] overly dramatic theatrics in the forms of speeches and actions by the protagonist\\" ‚Äî which led to a comparison to Eagle: The Making of an Asian-American President. Overall, Jakala said \\"the series has grown on [him] over time. Part of the reason is that Hidaka isn't just writing about dry political systems in the abstract; he humanizes concepts by crafting various characters that we follow through the tumultuous events depicted in this book.\\" Both Jakala and McElhatton highlighted and praised the fact that although Sakuragi is depicted as \\"handsome, suave, and poised\\" (Jakala), \\"decisive, smart, and charismatic\\" (McElhatton), \\"Yoshiki remembers to keep his character human; he's got his flaws, and his doubts that he hides from the public. In the end, it just makes him all the more likable\\" (McElhatton). In Jakala's opinion, \\"One of the strongest things about this series is Sakuragi's character\\" because \\"Hidaka hasn't gone too far in making Sakuragi unbelievably perfect\\". In opposition, Jason Thompson, writing for ANN, considered the depiction of \\"a badass Japanese politician, who stands up to America, China and North Korea, more comedic than believable.\\" Jakala commended the art because \\"Tsugihara helps distinguish characters by giving everyone distinctive looks.\\" Further, he appreciated how the detailing on body language and facial expressions, saying, \\"In one scene, I could almost feel the intensity of Sakuragi's gaze coming off the page.\\" RAC's commentator also asserted there are \\"lots of careful shots of people's faces to show their reactions\\", and deemed Tsugihara's art very suitable to the series, calling it \\"a solid, straight-forward style\\" and comparing it to storyboards for a television show or a film. Patrick King of Animefringe labeled it \\"a frighteningly realistic political thriller for the sophisticated reader\\" and said fans of The West Wing would probably \\"find this series appealing\\". A similar comparison was done by RAC's critic who affirmed that \\"If this was a television show, it would be the Japanese equivalent of The West Wing, able to make politics interesting to a wide audience though characters and situations that draw its viewers in.\\" King considered it \\"A very good series\\", while McElhatton declared, \\"One of the consistently best serials in the Raijin Comics anthology, The First President of Japan is one of those series that I think almost anyone who likes 'real world' stories would appreciate.\\" In a 2015 list, Matt White of Publishers Weekly ranked it among the \\"12 Great Comics On Presidential Politics\\". On the other hand, Thompson, said \\"It's sort of like a faltering unintentional prototype for The Legend of Koizumi\\" and that \\"it ends very abruptly\\".

History William was born in South Australia, the son of Charles Sanders (c. 1846 ‚Äì 10 July 1891) from Redruth, Cornwall, and Sarah Rhoda Sanders, n√©e Veysey (c. 1844 ‚Äì 27 August 1890). She was daughter of Frederick John Veysey of Athelstone. Charles was the keeper of Thorndon Park reservoir, and killed himself there, by hanging. William studied for Bachelor of Music at the Elder Conservatorium of Music around 1888: piano under Gotthold Reimann and organ under John Ellis. William Pybus, a near-contemporary, was a fellow-student. He served briefly as organist at St. Paul's Anglican church in Port Adelaide, followed by Kent Town Wesleyan Methodist Church from 1890 to 1893, then began working in conjunction with organ-builder J. E. Dodd soon after he took over the business of Fincham & Hobday, setting up an organ teaching studio at their factory in Twin Street. He was appointed musical director, choirmaster and organist at Clayton Congregational Church in May 1895 at a salary of ¬£50 per annum. The original church instrument, which though of good make, was old and somewhat limiting, and following a donation of ¬£1,000 from Sir Edwin Smith, Sanders ordered a new one, built in Adelaide by the firm of J. E. Dodd of Twin Street, which was duly installed and opened by Sanders on 8 September 1897. This article includes a comprehensive technical specification of the instrument, as well as the pieces performed. He resigned his post in 1916, and his replacement, pro tem, was Harold Wylde. He remained a worshipper at Clayton for many years, sometimes giving organ recitals, on occasion as a duet with his son Ray. Other activities He was frequently called on to judge choir competitions and musical contests in the city and country centres. He wrote, as \\"Musicus\\", the column Musical Notes for the Evening Journal and the South Australian Register from 1897 to 1911, and served as the paper's music critic. He was one of the first to predict future greatness for Peter Dawson. A similar Musical Notes column, also bylined \\"Musicus\\", ran in the Daily Herald in 1920 and 1921. This may have been Sanders, but the style of writing bears little resemblance to the Evening Journal pieces. Sanders edited a paper called Music from 1896 to 1900. In 1913 or earlier he established \\"Sanders' Piano Warehouse\\" at 81 Grenfell Street, selling pianos and organs. The firm was still operating in 1950, managed or owned by Ray Sanders.

The episode received positive reviews, with critics highlighting Benedict Samuel's performance although Bruce's doppelganger's story received mixed reviews. Plot At Sirens Nightclub, Jervis Tetch (Benedict Samuel) performs an hypnosis show to the audience, to Barbara's (Erin Richards) delight but Tabitha's (Jessica Lucas) concern. He selects a man of the audience to be his volunteer after seeing his wife's collar. After performing the hypnosis on the man, he whispers something to him before freeing him from the hypnosis. Barbara questions whether people can do anything he says to which Tetch explains, \\"only things they secretly wish to do\\". At Wayne Manor, Bruce's (David Mazouz) doppelganger reveals to Bruce and Alfred (Sean Pertwee) that he's named \\"514A\\" but \\"5\\" to be short and that he awoke in Indian Hill over a year ago and they performed tests on him. Bruce decides to let him stay with them although Alfred is worried about him. Having slept with Valerie (Jamie Chung), Gordon (Benjamin McKenzie) goes to the GCPD to collect his bounty. He runs into Lee (Morena Baccarin), who was being offered her previous job back by Barnes (Michael Chiklis). She explains to Jim that she is moving permanently to Gotham with her fianc√©, who is a doctor in head trauma in the Gotham General, and she is seeking to join the GCPD again. That night, the man Tetch hypnotized is awoken by a phone call. The man in the other end is Tetch, who whispers the same words he used and uses it to open the door for him. The man kills his wife under the hypnosis and is then told by Tetch to kill himself while Tetch takes the house for himself as he plans on finding his missing sister, Alice. Alice (Naian Gonzalez Norvind) is revealed to be living with a gift; she has a virus in her blood that kills people. She accidentally kills her landlord when he tries to kiss her. Mayor James (Richard Kind) announces to the press that he plans on continuing his position as mayor. However, Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) and his mob interrupt the press to criticize the \\"corrupt\\" system and Mayor James and announces that he will run for mayor in the new elections. Bruce and Alfred notice scars on \\"5\\"'s body and are confused when he bests Alfred in boxing and takes a punch without feeling pain. Tetch visits Gordon, asking for help in finding Alice. He explains that after losing their parents, he took care of her when she began experiencing a rare condition, to which he sought help from Hugo Strange. It revealed a poison in her blood and he took her for \\"supervision\\" and never saw her again. After hearing of the Indian Hill breakout, he deduces that she escaped alongside the others. Gordon agrees to find her when he doubles the GCPD's offer. Cobblepot begins working on his campaign, showing Butch (Drew Powell) that the headquarters are based on Dahl Manor, planning on leaving a legacy for his father. Selina (Camren Bicondova) approaches Bruce for help in locating Ivy but they end up having an argument and she calls Bruce selfish before leaving. \\"5\\" watches this and begins to imitate Bruce's voice.

The owner and some goons arrive and attack him but Gordon manages to beat them. However, he is injured in the head and goes to the hospital for stitches. The doctor stitching him is revealed to be Mario (James Carpinello), Lee's fianc√©. He explains that he won't hurt her although Gordon \\"threatens\\" to kill him if he ever does so. Cobblepot meets with James in a restaurant to discuss his campaign. Cobblepot states that James' position is endangering the city and upon threatening him, they are surrounded by both parties' guards. Cobblepot then gives him a patch for his campaign, while planning on having someone help him. Gordon locates Alice's room and finds the landlord in the closet, who attacks him until Alice arrives and kills him. She then burns the corpse as she claims it's infected and flees, claiming she wants nothing to do with Tetch. In Wayne Manor, \\"5\\" watches Bruce sleeping and then begins to cut his hair to make it look like Bruce. The next morning, Bruce and Alfred find that he left and took clothes and a car. Cobblepot arrives at Arkham Asylum and threatens the Warden in order to claim that Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) is sane and freed. Nygma is released and picked up by Cobblepot that night. Tetch performs again in the Sirens, this time causing Barbara to kiss him, stunning Tabitha. Gordon confronts Tetch about Alice's claim so he takes him to the rooftop to talk but Tetch hypnotizes Gordon and sends him to climb on the ledge to fall to his death. Alice arrives and stops him. Tetch tries to talk her down but she shoots him in the shoulder, causing Gordon to awake from the hypnosis. Alice saves Gordon from falling from the roof, afterward, he handcuffs her.

Production =Development= On September 2016, it was announced that the third episode of the season will be titled \\"Look Into My Eyes\\" and was to be directed by Rob Bailey and written by executive producer Danny Cannon. =Writing= The episode is remarked as a point where the show gets political, with critics noting emphasis on Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. Actor Robin Lord Taylor talked about the approach, \\"I think the Gotham writers are writing our actual reality right now, and that's probably the scariest thing you could possibly imagine. He tries to present himself as he thinks a candidate should look. There is a certain homage to a certain candidate who is out there which is entirely intentional. Our show is like any comic book in that the stories are written to reflect the times in which we live. Comic books are written with that idea in mind, the social climate. So our show is reflecting that.\\" The episode was originally titled \\"Misscarrige of Justice\\". =Casting= On June 2016, it was revealed that the Mad Hatter would be appearing in the third season. On July 18, The Walking Deads vet Benedict Samuel was cast in the role, with the role described as \\"a talented hypnotist teetering on the edge of madness. He arrives in Gotham with an unwavering desire to find his sister, Alice, a young woman who went missing in the city years ago.\\" On August 23, 2016, Naian Gonzalez Norvind was cast as his sister, Alice, with her role being described as \\"she has a powerful ability she was born with, that she thinks is a curse and Jervis Tetch aka Mad Hatter, thinks is a gift.\\" Chris Chalk and Maggie Geha don't appear in the episode as their respective characters. In September 2016, it was announced that the guest cast for the episode would include Jamie Chung as Valerie Vale, Naian Gonzalez Norvind as Alice Tetch, Richard Kind as Aubrey James, James Carpinello as Mario Falcone, and John Doman as Carmine Falcone. Reception =Viewers= The episode was watched by 3.19 million viewers with a 1.0/3 share among adults aged 18 to 49, a series low. This was a 10% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 3.54 million viewers with a 1.2/4 in the 18-49 demographics. With this rating, Gotham ranked second for FOX, behind Lucifer, fourth on its timeslot and eight for the night behind Lucifer, Scorpion, Dancing with the Stars, Timeless, Kevin Can Wait, The Voice, and The Big Bang Theory.

The episode received a rating of 90% with an average score of 7.5 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. The website's critics consensus states, \\"'Look Into My Eyes' strategically primes viewers for future thrills with a creepy new villain and off-the-wall humor.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.6 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"'Look Into My Eyes' gave us a cool and creepy Mad Hatter, some nice Falcone family surprises, and a politically-minded Penguin. The clone arc is pretty dang dumb, but overall I'm still enjoying the show's use of Gordon. Particularly, here, how his role as a bounty hunter is being woven into the guest villain storyline.\\" Merrill Barr of Forbes wrote, \\"Gotham is a strange but tantalizing mess of a show right now. It‚Äôs hard to even tell what it‚Äôs trying to be anymore. When it began, it was being painted as a depiction of the city‚Äôs demise that would ultimately lead to there needing to be a Batman 15 years from now. However, in the pilot, the city was already in ruin and instead of spiraling further, it‚Äôs just gotten sillier and sillier.\\" Nick Hogan of TV Overmind gave the series a star rating of 4.5 out of 5, writing \\"Ultimately, I found this to be an enjoyable episode. Cobblepot was fantastic, Jim's story was an emotional roller coaster, Leslie & Falcone returned, Nygma was freed, and we met the Mad Hatter. It sounds jam packed, but each story was told with ease and little flash. Very well done.\\" Sage Young of EW stated: \\"Over on Fox this Monday night, a career politician who's made some mistakes went head-to-head with an eccentric opportunist who's exploiting the fear of the masses for a position of power. No, you didn't miss the last presidential debate: Oswald Cobblepot has thrown his hat into the ring of Gotham's mayoral race.\\" Lisa Babick from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.0 star rating out of 5.0, stating: \\"I'm not getting the Butch/Penguin dynamic at all this season so far. They seem separated, yet Butch is always right there. So how can he not know what's going on? It's just odd. Still, it's pretty exciting that Penguin threw his hat in the ring. In a crap town like Gotham, Penguin does seem like the best choice. He'd certainly add a lot of flavor to the office. But, even more exciting is that Penguin got Nygma out of Arkham. What is Jim going to think about that little tidbit when he finds out?\\" Drew Grant of New York Observer wrote, \\"Watching Jim Gordon slowly climb up the police chain with his loyalty and strong morals has been excruciating. All the good intentions in the world do not make you qualified to be a police officer anywhere in the world except Gotham. I'm so glad he's a bounty hunter now!\\" MaryAnn Sleasman of TV.com questioned the episode, stating \\"I want Gotham to return to the crazy creativity that gave us the Maniax early last season, the tragic origins of so many future rogues gallery all-stars, and sure, even Galavan. That doesn't mean replaying the story with a different cast or keeping Fish Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith) waiting in the wings like some kind of unspoken threat: 'Oh, you don't like Gotham City political drama? Careful, we can always bring this hot mess back.'\\" Kayti Burt of Den of Geek gave the episode a 3.5 star rating out of 5 and wrote, \\"Gotham is at its best when it is doing these two characters well, and tonight's episode ‚Äî 'Look Into My Eyes' ‚Äî was the perfect example.\\" References  External links  * * Category:Gotham (season 3) episodes Category:2016 American television episodes ","title":"Look into My Eyes (Gotham)"},{"id":"51868728","text":"Abdellatif Mohamed Ahmed Mohamed (born December 8, 1995) is an Egyptian Greco- Roman wrestler.

She is the former assistant coach for the Afghanistan Women's National Football Team and currently serves as the goalkeeper coach for the Antigua and Barbuda Women's National Team. Early life Born and raised in Friendswood, Texas, Carter competed in three Texas high school state championships and was the starting goalkeeper of the Friendswood High School 2001 Texas 4A UIL State High School Championship team. After graduating from high school in 2002, Carter played four years of NCAA Division I Women's Soccer at the United States Naval Academy. Following her time at Navy, she spent nearly eight years in the United States Marine Corps having made multiple combat deployments in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Playing career While serving on active duty in the Marine Corps, Carter represented the United States in two International Military Sports Council Women's Military World Soccer Championships (Ede, Netherlands ‚Äì 2008, Cherbourg-Octeville, 2010). In 2010, Carter was named Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point Female Athlete of the Year and finalist for the United States Marine Corps Female Athlete of the Year. From 2010‚Äì2013, Carter was stationed in Hawaii and played semi-professionally for the Honolulu Bulls W1 Women's team, where she was teammates with future professional player Caprice Dydasco. Upon her end of active service in 2013, Carter returned to Texas and spent the next three years as a reserve goalkeeper for the Houston Dash in the National Women's Soccer League. She made her first‚Äîand to date, only‚Äîprofessional appearance against the Washington Spirit on August 18, 2016.  Coaching career While playing at Houston, Carter also served as a volunteer assistant coach for the women's soccer programs at Huston‚ÄìTillotson University and Sam Houston State University. She has served not only as assistant coach for the Afghanistan women's national football team but also as an Olympic Development coach for South Texas Youth Soccer Association and the South Region (formerly Region III) of the United States Youth Soccer Association. On November 10, 2016, Carter became the first female professional player to receive the FIFPro World Players Union Merit Award for her efforts coaching the Afghanistan women. She used these funds to cover the teams expenses and participation in the 2016 South Asia Football Federation Women's Championships. During 2017, the team did not participate in any formal events due to budget constraints. They attended their first training camp of 2018 in Amman, Jordan, where they played two games against the Jordanian Women's National Team. In November 2018, Carter and Afghan National Team head coach, Kelly Lindsey, were left off the Afghanistan Football Federation's delegation for the Central Asian Football Association's Women's Championships. Their absence was accompanied by the simultaneous dismissal of multiple key players from the team, including its Captain, Shabnam Mobarez. Shortly thereafter, the dismissed players released statements on social media that their dismissal was the result of a refusal to sign a player contract substantially limiting their rights as players and human beings. Carter stated that the contract forced upon the players was deemed non-negotiable by the Afghan Federation, it was unconscionable, and that she could not support asking the players to take part. The contract has been linked to an effort to intimidate and silence the players and staff from publicly discussing allegations they made to the Afghanistan Football Federation detailing the sexual abuse of women players by male Federation members. Documentation supporting the allegations was provided to Hummel International, and on November 30, 2018, Hummel terminated their sponsorship with the Afghan Football Federation and immediately demanded the removal of its president, Kerim Kerramudin. The allegations were investigated by both the Afghanistan Attorney General, Farid Hamidi, and the FIFA Ethics Committee. As of December 9, 2018, five members of the Afghan Football Federation, including its president, were suspended indefinitely following initial inquiries. On June 8, 2019, following its investigation, FIFA announced a lifetime ban for Kerim Kerramudin and fined him 1,000,000 CHF for breaching article 23 (protection of physical and mental integrity) and article 25 (abuse of position) of the FIFA Code of Ethics. On the following day, the Afghanistan Attorney General's office also issued an arrest warrant for Kerramudin although he remains at large. The investigation of additional Afghanistan Football Federation officials is ongoing. Following her departure from the Afghan Women's National Team, Carter was nominated to run for Vice President of the United Soccer Coaches Board of Directors and although losing the election, was later appointed Chair of the United Soccer Coaches Women Coaches Advocacy Group. In October 2019, Carter joined Lisa Cole's staff for the Antigua and Barbuda Women's National Team as a goalkeeper coach at the 2020 CONCACAF Caribbean Football Union's Olympic Qualifiers. Personal life In addition to her degree from the Naval Academy, Carter owns an MBA with Distinction from the University of Liverpool and currently attends the University of Houston Law Center in pursuit of a joint Juris Doctor/Master of Laws (J.D./LL.M.), specializing in International Law. Her military awards and decorations include the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal (w/ Gold Star in Lieu of Second Award), the Joint Unit Commendation Medal, Global War on Terrorism Medal, and Iraqi Campaign Medal (w/ 3 Bronze Stars).

Early life and education  George Wall, was born on 22 December 1820 in North Shields, Northumberland, England, the second son of George Wall (1773‚Äì1852), a Methodist Minister, and Ann n√©e Lytham. He attended Harrow School. Wall began his career in the engineering firm of Sir Joseph Whitworth. Suffering ill health, in September 1846 he moved to Ceylon to take advantage of the climate, and was made acting manager of the Ceylon Plantation Company in Kandy. He remained with the company until 1854, when he established his own business, George Wall and Company, Coffee Merchants and Estate Agents.  Coffee and other trade  Wall opened an office in Colombo and the business soon grew into an important concern, with Wall rising to prominence, accordingly. He became the first Englishman to chair the Planters' Association of Ceylon (1856‚Äì1857) and was re-elected Chairman nine times. From 1858 Wall sat on the Legislative Council of Ceylon as an unofficial member, supporting the case against the Paddy Tax. On 15 November 1864, Wall along with James De Alwis, Charles Lorenz, W. Thompson, John Capper and John Eaton resigned from the Council on a point of principle regarding the fiscal policy of the Government and its strict disregard to respect the procedures of the Legislative Council. Wall returned to England in 1859 and spent the next four years in Manchester, where he served as a partner with his former employer, Sir Joseph Whitworth & Co., enjoying success in small arms manufacturing. Upon his return to Ceylon, he was elected chair of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in 1866.He was made a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in February 1872 and the Linnean Society of London. Wall's business eventually suspended operations in August 1879 following a devastating outbreak of coffee blight. George Wall and Company was subsequently taken over by Bosanquet and Company.  Botany and later life  Alongside his business activities, Wall was a keen botanist and amateur astronomer. He was especially interested in ferns and built up a significant herbarium of plants from Ceylon. In 1889 he became the editor of the Ceylon Independent newspaper, a position he retained for six years. In 1892 Wall received the Gold Medal from the Cobden Club for his efforts in abolishing the Ceylon Grain tax. After falling ill in 1894 he returned to England for treatment at St. Thomas' Hospital, where he died in December that year. He was married twice (Alice n√©e Makinson (1822‚Äì1854), the cousin of Edward Watkin and Mary Anne n√©e Dixon, and had thirteen children. One of his sons, Arnold (1869‚Äì1966), went on to become a professor of botany in New Zealand and another, Frank, also became a naturalist. His daughter Rowena married Edward Seymour, 16th Duke of Somerset in 1881. He died on 18 December 1894.  Legacy  Wall Street in Kotahena, Sri Lanka, is named in honour of George Wall. A Hindu-Saracenic fountain at the Lipton Circus junction in Cinnamon Gardens, Colombo was erected in memory of Wall.

Early life Mann was born in Toodyay, Western Australia, to Caroline Jane (n√©e Edwards) and John Gibson Mann. He was raised in Beverley, where his father was an early settler and served as the town's mayor for a period. Mann enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in December 1914, and during the war served with the 10th Light Horse Regiment. After returning to Australia, he took up land at Beverley as part of a soldier settlement scheme.James Isaac Mann ‚Äì Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia. Retrieved 20 September 2016. Politics Mann first ran for parliament at the 1924 state election, but was narrowly defeated by Charles Wansbrough in the seat of Beverley, losing by just 15 votes on the two-candidate-preferred count. Both Mann and Wansbrough stood for the Country Party, but owing to a split in party stood for different factions, with Mann representing the Ministerial faction (supporting the government of James Mitchell) and Wansbrough representing the Executive faction (opposing Mitchell's government). At the 1927 state election, Mann recontested Beverley for the Nationalist Party, but was again defeated by Wansbrough. He had switched back to the Country Party by the 1930 election, and on his third attempt defeated Wansbrough with 55.4 percent of the two-candidate-preferred vote.

The seat of Beverley was abolished at the 1950 state election, and Mann transferred to the new seat of Avon Valley. He held that seat until his retirement at the 1962 election, consistently winning large majorities (and running unopposed on one occasion, in 1953).

He was founder and vice president of South Brooklyn Savings Institution and president of the Lenox Fire Insurance Company. He sat on the board or was a trustee for many organizations. As the result of his success, Jarvis was able to be a contributor and founder of a number of educational, historical, religious, and other efforts. His donations helped establish the Episcopalian Jarvis Hall, a college for males in Golden, Colorado; Wolfe Hall in Denver for girls; Bronson Hall at Cheshire Academy; and Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. He wrote a book about the genealogical lineage of the Jarvis family. Jarvis was married three times and had one child, Mary Caroline who married Dr. Frederick J. Bancroft in Denver. Early years Bowden Hall at Cheshire Academy, the oldest schoolhouse in continuous use in the state of Connecticut George Atwater Jarvis, born on March 9, 1806 in Cheshire, Connecticut. He was the son of Stephen and Mary Ann Atwater Jarvis, who was the daughter of Benjamin Atwater of Cheshire. His father was treasurer and warden at the St. Peter's church. Both of his parents were devout Episcopalians. His grandfather was Hezekiah Jarvis. Jarvis had a brother, Benjamin and other siblings. George attended an Episcopalian Cheshire Academy, which was run by Rev. Dr. Tillotson Bronson. At some point during his childhood, Benjamin began to be raised by his uncle, Titus Atwater. Benjamin was a legislator, farmer, and official at St. Peters Church. His family had been Episcopalians for several generations. Some were wardens, lay-readers, and bishops. His immediate family lived in the former home of a relative, Bishop Abraham Jarvis. The house was built for the bishop about 1797 when he became a trustee of the newly opened Episcopalian academy in Cheshire. Professional and philanthropic career =Professions= George A. Jarvis hard times tokens from his Wine and Tea store, 1837 At 18 years of age, Jarvis went to New York. His uncle, Noah Jarvis, let him live in his home and made an arrangement with a wool store for George to work as an apprentice with no pay for a year while he learned the business. The second year, he was paid for his work. Within the third year, the economy crashed. Jarvis lost his position at the store and, because of the poor economy, he was unable to find another position. Noah hired his nephew to assist him in the collection of assessments and he performed well. Noah provided a loan so that George could establish a grocery business near Broadway on Grand Street. George repaid the loan, with interest, within several years. George was a wine and tea dealer. He issued copper hard times tokens with his address 142 Grand near Elm, a bust image of Liberty, and the year 1837. He cofounded a wholesale grocery business, Stanton and Jarvis, in September 1838. Former South Brooklyn Savings Institution building, now Trader Joe's After Jarvis moved to Brooklyn in 1841, he developed business and civic interests within the borough. Jarvis withdrew from Stanton and Jarvis in 1854 and the same year resigned as director of Atlantic Dock Company. Jarvis was a trustee or director of the Home Life Insurance Company, Brooklyn Collegiate and Polytechnic Institute and Union Trust Company. For 33 years, he was vice president of South Brooklyn Savings Institution, which he co-founded. Jarvis was president of the Lenox Fire Insurance Company beginning in 1860, during which time it had acquired a $90,000 surplus after having been \\"crippled\\". He retired in 1881. =New York and other eastern states= Christ Church in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn Jarvis made large donations to the Christ Church in Brooklyn and his hometown St. Peter's Church. The Cheshire Academy received funds for the construction of Bronson Hall from Jarvis. He also provided scholarships for the Berkeley Divinity School in Middletown. Jarvis was one of the founders of the Brooklyn Athenaeum. He was also a director or trustee of the General Theological Seminary of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States and The Church Charity Foundation. Jarvis was a member of the Brooklyn Mercantile Library, New York Chamber of Commerce, and the Long Island Historical Society. =Colorado= George M. Randall During the history of the Colorado Territory, Jarvis worked with his friend Bishop George M. Randall to develop Episcopalian educational facilities in Colorado, where Randall was an Episcopal missionary for the Diocese of Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming. The friendship between Randall and Jarvis began when Randall came to New York in 1835 seeking a theological education after graduating from Brown University. After they met, Jarvis donated monies to fund Randall's education. Thus began the first of many efforts by Jarvis to donate funds for people's Episcopal seminary education. He purchased land in Denver for Bishop Randall, his daughter, the Diocese to build a church, other charities, and personal investment. Wolfe Hall Wolfe Hall, an Episcopalian academy for girls in Denver, Colorado, 1871 Jarvis donated funds for the development of Wolfe Hall, an Episcopal school for girls in Denver. It was located at Champa and 17th Street. Jarvis was the largest contributor to the territorial activities of Bishop Randall. John D. Wolfe of New York was the second largest donor and the namesake for Wolfe Hall, which opened in September 1868. Bishop Randall lived at Wolfe Hall with his wife. Jarvis Hall Jarvis Hall (on the left) in Golden, Colorado before it burned down in 1874 Jarvis created an endowment to found Jarvis Hall, a liberal arts, grammar and military college for males in 1869 that was a predecessor of the Colorado School of Mines. Randall coordinated the creation of the university in Golden, Colorado which operated from 1870 until 1874, when it was destroyed by a fire. The college operated in another Golden building from 1878 to 1882. The school moved to Denver in 1882, where it operated until 1904. The site is now part of the Lowry Campus. Military service During the time that Davis was managing his business, he had also served in the National Guard of the City of New York from September 1, 1832 to June 4, 1841, when he was honorably discharged. Horatio Seymour, Governor of New York, appointed Jarvis as a War Committee member in 1862. Rather than serve in the New York Seventh regiment, Jarvis hired someone to serve in his stead. This was a practice that other businessmen and friends utilized. He was a member of the Veteran Corps of Artillery of the State of New York. Personal life and death Jarvis was married three times. Catharine Jarvis, his first wife, died within a year of their marriage. She was the daughter of Samuel Jarvis of New York. Jarvis married his second wife, Mary McLean on February 11, 1836. She was the daughter of Cornelius McLean of New York. Maria Jenkins, his third wife, was the daughter of Lewis Jenkins of Canandaigua, New York and then Buffalo. Maria was the granddaughter of Hon. Moses Atwater, a founder of St. John's Episcopal Church, Canandaigua. His only surviving child was Mary Caroline that he had with his second wife, Mary McLean Jarvis. Unable to approve of his daughter's suitor, Jarvis broke their relationship and arranged for Mary Caroline to travel to Europe for a \\"Grand Tour\\", which did not relieve her broken heart. Mary Caroline contracted tuberculosis after throwing herself \\"arduously into church work\\". Mary Caroline came to Denver with Bishop George M. Randall to cure her case of tuberculosis. For one year she lived with Bishop Randall and his wife before she married Dr. Frederick J. Bancroft in 1871. During an extended trip to celebrate his daughter's wedding, Jarvis bought four lots that the couple could build a house upon at the southwest corner of Stout and 16th Street. Mary Caroline, an Episcopalian, was a contributor to church and Denver community activities. Jarvis moved to Brooklyn in 1841 and three years later had a house built there. Jarvis wrote the book The Jarvis Family: Or, The Descendants Of The First Settlers Of The Name In Massachusetts And Long Island, And Those Who Have More Recently Settled In Other Parts Of The United States And British America. On May 8, 1893, Jarvis died. He was buried in Brooklyn at Greenwood Cemetery of Brooklyn. Among the charities that Javis left money to in his will, the largest was for construction of Trinity College of Hartford, Connecticut.

In Hungary, the Serbian population was very active in defending the southern border against the Ottomans. The production of this type of sword became more typologically uniform in Hungary and Venice.

N. Rao and produced by Mubarak Pictures. Based on the life of the Kashmiri poet of the same name, the film stars K. R. Ramasamy and A. R. Sakunthala. It was released on 1 November 1948.  Plot  A king hires the poet Bilhana to educate his daughter, Yamini. To prevent having a romance developing between them, the king lies to Yamini that Bilhana is blind, and to Bilhana that Yamini is deformed. When they are to interact, he arranges a curtain between the two. One day, during a lesson, Bilhana is amused at the sight of the full moon in the sky. To express his feeling of rapture, he starts reciting a poem. At this, Yamini begins wondering how a blind man could sing about the beauty of the moon so well. She pulls down the curtain and finds that Bilhana is attractive and youthful. At the same time, Bilhana learns that Yamini is beautiful and not disfigured. The two fall in love, and decide to marry, much to the anger of the king, who sentences them both to death. When the king's friends and other people revolt against his decision, he yields, and the two lovers marry.  Production  In 1944, T. R. Sundaram of Modern Theatres announced his intention to direct a film adaptation of the story of the Kashmiri poet Bilhana, to star M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar. However, the film was shelved due to Bhagavathar's arrest as a suspect in the Lakshmikanthan murder case. Later, the TKS Brothers adapted the story of Bilhana twice. The first instance was for a stage performance and the second was for the screen, in April 1948 under the title Bilhanan. Since the story was not protected by copyright, Mubarak Pictures could produce their own adaptation, with the title Bilhana. This version was directed by B. N. Rao and scripted by S. Sundarachariar, with music by Papanasam Sivan. The film featured K. R. Ramasamy as the title character and A. R. Sakunthala as Yamini. Supporting roles were played by G. Sakunthala, S. M.

She was one of the founders of the Elsie Women's Refuge Night Shelter, the first women‚Äôs refuge in Australia. Early life Bessie Jean Thompson Mitchell was born on 2 July 1905 at Rosalie, Church Street, Camperdown, New South Wales. The only child of James Buchanan Mitchell and his wife Jane Elizabeth Coulson. She was raised and educated by her two schoolteacher aunts, Janet Forbes Mackenzie Mitchell and Margaret Crichton Mitchell. Education Guthrie attended industrial and modern interior design classes at East Sydney Technical College. She was the first woman to hold an exhibition of design art at the college in 1930. Career Guthrie began selling her designs for modular furniture to various companies. She was employed as furniture draughtswoman with Grace Bros Ltd's department stores. Guthrie also developed a private practice in interior design specialising in the modernist style. Her group of friends included Hal Missingham, Kenneth Slessor and Dulcie Deamer who invited her to write for the Australian Woman's Mirror in the late 1930s. She also contributed to the Australian Women's Weekly and Good Fellows magazines. =Publisher= Guthrie established her own publishing company, Viking Press, in 1939. She concentrated on anti-war tracts and designed and illustrated books of women's poetry including the earliest works of Dorothy Auchterlonie (later Green), Elizabeth Riddell, Elizabeth Lambert, Harley Matthews and Muir Holburn. =WW2= During WW2 Guthrie became head draughtswoman for De Havilland Aircraft Pty Ltd's experimental gliders factory and worked for the Commonwealth as a draughtswoman on aircraft design. =Teacher and activist= After the war, Guthrie lectured in design at East Sydney Technical College, the Workers' Educational Association and for the university's Department of Tutorial Classes. Guthrie worked as a clerk in the Government Insurance Office of New South Wales from 1952 until her retirement in 1972. In the 1950s Guthrie and her husband opened their home to young girls who were victims of domestic violence, abuse, drunkenness, homelessness and the child welfare system. Guthrie was one of a small group of women who made a squatter occupation of two empty houses in inner-city Glebe which led to the establishment of 'Elsie' in 1974, the first refuge in Australia for women and children who were the victims of domestic violence. Bessie Guthrie continued her 20 year involvement with girls and women. She did extensive research of the network of Children‚Äôs Courts, church and state homes and the child welfare system generally, and led protests and gained publicity that gradually led to change including the closure of both the Parramatta Girls' Training School and Hay children's prison.

The agitation is also known as Perinad Lahala or Perinad Mutiny. It enjoys a significant position in Kerala history.  History  The agitation was a sudden uprising against the upper class's dictum to the minority castes to not use the public road, denying the right to education, prohibiting entry to temples and denying women to wear gold or metal ornaments. The agitation intensified by December-end and a meeting was convened under the chair of Ayyankali on 21 December 1915 at Plavilapurayidom, Cherumoodu, near Perinad where women belonging to Pulaya community threw away the Kallumala (ornaments made out of stone and woods) and proclaimed that they will only use gold or metal ornaments. Kallumala's were chains of beads worn by their ladies as a symbol of slavery and inferior caste status. Through this agitation the oppressed class fought the caste elites by breaking their chains to win the right to wear ornaments. During pre-independence era women from lower castes in Kerala faced severe unfathomable oppression. There were strict diktats regarding dress codes and ornaments and there was even taxes to be paid to erstwhile Travancore kings for covering their breasts.

It aired on November 16, 2016, on the cable network FX. The episode was written by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk, and directed by Bradley Buecker. Plot The March after My Roanoke Nightmare aired, it is screened at PaleyFest, where the cast and crew were interviewed by Trixie Mattel and Edward Hansen. During the interview, Sidney teases the possibility of a second season. During the Q&A; the rabid fans profess their love to various members of the cast, and the re-enactors compete for the audience's attention. One British fan loves Lee and asks if she can give her a picture she drew, which Lee reluctantly agrees to. Sometime later, the same fan makes a YouTube video, directly addressing Lee, asking her why she felt the need to come back for the follow up to My Roanoke Nightmare. She goes on to criticize the derivative nature of the follow-up, saying that it felt contrived and would only tarnish the legacy of the original. In another video, the real Lot Polk films himself promising vengeance on Lee for taking his two children away from him and killing his family members. A television series called Crack'd documents Lee's life, her family, her addiction to pills, her custody battle, her kidnapping of her daughter, her murder of her ex-husband, Mason, and her appearance on My Roanoke Nightmare. During an on- camera interview, the district attorney claims he always knew Lee was guilty and that the footage of the murders from Return to Roanoke: Three Days in Hell prove it. Lee goes on trial for the murders but her attorney successfully uses the horror and psychological trauma that Lee faced at the hands of the Polks as a defense strategy. Not satisfied, the district attorney then prosecutes her for Mason's murder and, in another interview, walks through his evidence of Lee's guilt. During the trial, Lee's daughter Flora testifies against her mother, saying the she witnessed Lee murder her father in the woods. During her cross examination, Lee's attorney questions why Flora went out into the woods alone in the first place. Flora says she went out there because she felt safe with Priscilla, and this is used by the attorney to cast doubt on her story. The series details that the jury found Lee not guilty of Mason's murder. The district attorney expresses frustration with the verdict. After the trial, Lee tries to talk to Flora but is rebuffed. This leads the district attorney to speculate that Lee lost a lot despite going free. In another TV series, The Lana Winters Special, famed reporter Lana Winters details Lee's life following her acquittal: Lee has written a best selling book about her harrowing ordeal and Lana has come out of retirement to interview her. Lee is skeptical of Lana's intentions but states that Flora gives her hope, and that hope gets her through, but admits when questioned that she doesn't see much of Flora. Lana says Lee can't be very surprised at this and Lee begins to get angry and defensive. Lana asks Lee why, despite offers from many major news outlets, Lee picked her, and Lee responds that she thought Lana would be more sympathetic given her history with atrocities. Lana bristles and says she had to do what she did in order to survive and that Lee only did what she did so that she could be with her daughter. Lana invites Lee to speak to Flora directly and Lee does, saying she hopes one day Flora can understand and forgive her for what she has done. Lana asks point blank about Flora's whereabouts, informing a shocked Lee that Flora went missing earlier that day, accusing Lee of having taken her. As Lee panics, there are sounds of assault rifle shots in the hallway. Lot Polk breaks into the room and threatens them, knocking Lana out with the butt of his rifle as she attempts to talk him into giving up the gun. Just as he is about to shoot Lee, he is shot to death by police who have just arrived on the scene. In another TV show, called Spirit Chasers, a group of paranormal investigators trespass into the Roanoke house during the blood moon, hoping to capture the reported ghosts of the house on film. As the house is being set up for filming, the host explains some of its haunted history. The series recruits the re-enactor who played Cricket Marlowe, Ashley Gilbert. Come nightfall, the participants begin to experience various paranormal events that unnerve them. They are interrupted by Lee, searching for her daughter who has now been missing for two weeks. The Spirit Chasers offer to help but she advises them to flee the house while they can. Thermal cameras pick up the ghosts of the Chen family and the voice of Priscilla is recorded. Lee advises them once again to leave, and goes in search of Priscilla. The chasers ignore Lee's advice and try to follow her, but are attacked by the Piggy Man (who kills Ashley), the skittering creature, and various spirits within the house. The rest of the Spirit Chasers attempt to flee, seeing police cars outside, but both they and the police are killed by Thomasin and her mob. Inside the house, Flora and Lee are reunited. The next day a news report details Lee's 14 hour stand-off with police at the Roanoke house. It is believed Lee kidnapped Flora and is holding her hostage. Lana finally sympathizes with Lee, admitting she understands her single mindedness in rescuing her daughter. Late in the afternoon, inside the house, Lee and Flora begin to bond again and Lee explains that her mistakes were always for Flora's benefit. Lee sincerely apologizes and emotionally begs forgiveness. Lee wants Flora to come home, but Flora wants to sacrifice herself by burning the house down and staying as a ghost for all eternity so that she can protect Priscilla from Thomasin. Lee offers to take Flora's place, so Flora can leave and live her life. After conferring with Priscilla, Flora agrees. After Flora leaves, Lee allows Priscilla to kill her, in the process burning down the house. As Flora leaves and is discovered and driven away by police, she watches Lee walk off into the woods with Priscilla. In the closing scene, Thomasin watches from a hilltop and laughing maniacally as her mob surrounds the remaining officers and the burning house, with the blood moon looming in the sky and the sound of wooden totems clanging ominously.

V. Srinivasan, written by A. S. A. Sami and produced by T. K. Shanmugam of TKS Brothers. An adaptation of the play of the same name by Sami, itself based on the story of the Kashmiri poet Bilhana, Shanmugam also stars as the title character, along with T. K. Bhagavathi, M. S. Draupathi, T. K.Sivathanu and \\"Friend\\" Ramasami.  Plot  A king searches for a teacher to educate his daughter Yamini, eventually settling on the poet Bilhana. To prevent any romance from developing between the two, the king tells Yamini that Bilhana is blind, and Bilhana that Yamini is deformed. He hangs a curtain between the two to prevent them from seeing each other. One night, amused by the sight of the full moon, Bilhana sings a poem in its praise. Yamini, wondering how a man can compose a poem about the moon when blind, pulls down the curtain and finds that Bilhana is attractive and youthful, and he finds the princess attractive in turn. The two fall in love and want to marry. The king opposes this and when Bilhana and Yamini do not listen to him, he sentences them both to death. The king's friends and people protest and, understanding the power of true love, he forgives Bilhana and Yamini and lets them marry.  Production  A. S. A. Sami wrote and produced the Tamil play Bilhanan, based on the life of the Kashmiri poet Bilhana, for his college's annual day celebrations. The play became a success, and soon he submitted it to the Tiruchirappalli station of All India Radio, who broadcast it as a radio drama, with M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar playing the title character. The radio drama was also a success, and T. K. Shanmugam of TKS Brothers bought the rights to the play. He later adapted it into a film with the same name, and starred as the title character, with M.S. Draupathi playing princess Yamini and T. K. Bhagavathi playing her father, the king. Sami rewrote the script for the film adaptation, which K. V. Srinivasan directed. Shooting took place at Central Studios in Coimbatore.  Soundtrack  The music of the film was composed by T. A. Kalyanam. One of the songs, \\"Thoondir Puzhuvinaipol\\" that was sung by the TKS brothers, used lyrics by the late Tamil poet Subramania Bharati. Film producer A. V. Meiyappan, who held the copyright to all of Bharati's work, sued the TKS Brothers for copyright infringement.  Release and reception  Bilhanan was released on 23 April 1948. According to film historian Randor Guy, the film was an average success because audiences \\"felt it was stagy in presentation\\". He did, however, note that the film would be \\"Remembered for the interesting storyline, impressive performances by Shanmugam, Bhagavathi and Draupathi\\".

Very interesting are the classical fa√ßade, with portals in the windows, and its square bell-tower, with four pointed arches.http://www.weagoo.com/it/card/13545/chiesa-del-ss-salvatore The church was closed for several years because of the damages suffered during the 1968 Belice earthquake. Until some years ago, every Wednesday evening they celebrated the Holy Mass in Latin, accompanied by the Gregorian chant and polyphonic ones of the del choir Jacopone da Todi. Inside the Church there are cultural activities connected with the sacred chants, the old one in particular, thanks to the same choir that uses this building on Sunday afternoon and on Wednesday evening.http://www.alqamah.it/2013/06/17/tela- del-700-restaurata-tornera-nella-chiesa-del-ss-salvatore-di-alcamo/ = Works = The church has one nave with a barrel vault and five altars. Inside it there are beautiful works of great artistic value, among which ten stucco statues: * Two great angels in the presbitery and eight allegorical statues on the walls (Religion, Faith, Patience, Renounce to World, Vigilance, Happiness, Charity and Hope) made by Serpotta's pupil, Bartolomeo Sanseverino (1758). * The Transfiguration of Jesus (1759‚Äì60), a painting on the high altar * saint Benedict among a group of saints, a fresco on the vault by Carlo Brunetti * the sacrificial Lamb among Angels, a fresco on the vault by Carlo Brunetti * Saint Benedict of Nursia, a marble statue realized by Antonino Gagini (1545) * The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa, assigned to Pietro Novelli, on the first right altar * The Assumption of Mary, assigned to Pietro Novelli, on the first left altar * The Annunciation: oval paintings by Baldassare Massa In 1982 the ovals of the Annunciation were stolen, together with the high reliefs of saint Michael the Archangel and with saint John Baptist, one of them was bought again at Sotheby's auction in 1994 for 25 million liras. = The Tabernacle = The marble tabernacle, in high relief and about four metres high, was made by Antonino Gagini and Baldassare Massa (1557‚Äì1558). The ciborium, among for kneeling angels, is surmounted by a Crucifix above the figures of saint John the Apostle, the Virgin Mary and the Holy Ghost as a dove and among four angels‚Äô heads:[5] there are also the scene of the Flagellation and the figure of saint John Baptist with Jesus‚Äôbaptism, saint Michael the Archangel while defeating Satan, the chasing away of the rebel angels into hell, and finally the coat of arms of Alcamo and of the abbess Margherita di Montesa.Gianni Guadalupi, Mariano Coppola, Alcamo, introduzione di Vincenzo Regina(collana Grand Tour), Milano, Grafiche Mazzucchelli, 1995, . She made Baldassare Massa (a sculptor from Palermo) complete the work started by Gagini and inserted seven scenes of the Passion of Jesus, two oval paintings representing saint Benedict and the Redeemer, and a depiction of God the Father with his open arms. The marble tabernacle of the Holy Sacrament was later gilded by Giovan Leonardo Bagolino, a painter from Verona and Sebastiano Bagolino‚Äôs father.  Nunnery  The sisters of the nunnery came from noble families; besides religious practices, they created works of sacred handicraft such as plastic polish and ceroplastics, and probably vestments. To avoid the suppression of the convent, owing to the 1866 Laws, they opened a school from 1862 onwards; in fact the sisters administrated a College for Civil Damsels with three classes working inside it;Carlo Cataldo: La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.226; ed.Campo, Alcamo, 2001 besides reading and writing correctly, they devoted themselves to embroidery, the study of arithmetics, geography and Italian. In the final year they studied history, music and French; the boarding fee also included books, equipment and any medical care. The convent was suppressed in 1906: the remaining nuns were moved to the nunnery of Badia Nuova, and the premises were first used as barracks, then as schools (primary, nursery and training school). Today they are utilised by the secondary school \\"Pietro Maria Rocca\\".

Life Zollner was born in Regensburg, Germany, in 1966 and has been a member of the Jesuits since the 16 September 1990. He studied philosophy and theology in Regensburg. He completed his Doctorate in Theology at University of Innsbruck, and furthered his studies in Psychology at the Institute of Psychology at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. Since 2003, he has taught at the Institute of Psychology at the Pontifical Gregorian University. Zollner filled the role of academic Vice Rector of the Gregorian from 2010 to 2019. Zollner is regarded as one of the leading ecclesiastical experts in the field of safeguarding of minors from sexual abuse, especially in the Catholic Church. He has been a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors since its creation in 2014 and president of the Centre for Child Protection (CCP) at the Gregorian. In 2010‚Äì2011 he was a member of the Scientific Working Group of the ‚ÄúRound Table on Child Abuse‚Äù commissioned by the Federal Government of Germany. He co-authored Chiesa e pedofilia. Una ferita aperta. Un approccio psicologico-pastorale (\\"The Church and Pedophilia ‚Äì An Open Wound: A Psychological and Pastoral Approach\\") (2010). He is also Honorary Professor in the Department of Theology and Religion of the University of Durham (England). Hans Zollner views safeguarding minors as one of the main tasks the Catholic Church needs to have at heart. On 1 April 2017, Pope Francis appointed him as a consultor to the Congregation for the Clergy. As of March 2017, he reported, he had visited 40 countries to address episcopal conferences on the need for developing awareness and establishing safeguarding measures. In May 2010, he co-authored an article defending the record of Pope Benedict XVI in removing priests accused of sexual abuse. The article presented data to show that sexual abuse is no higher among celibate clergy than in other areas and that media reports present an inflated picture of the scale of the problem. It decried the \\"moral panic\\" surrounding the subject of clerical sexual abuse. In 2011, when Polish church officials were downplaying the need for a commission to establish procedures for handling cases of clerical sexual abuse, he told a Polish magazine that \\"If the church in Poland doesn't confront this reality and doesn't take the bull by the horns, the same thing will happen which we witnessed in the United States, Canada, Ireland, Germany, Austria and recently in Belgium. If the church doesn't know how to react to such situations because it hasn't bothered to ascertain the facts, its image will suffer much more than if it had said, 'Yes, we had such cases -- they were very painful, but we tackled them.'\\" Addressing church workers in Australia in September 2017, Zollner said that in Australia \\"there seems to be almost nil trust in what the Church says .... This is not true in other parts of the world. I think you are in a pretty unique situation\\". He thought Europe and North America had made progress in dealing with clerical sexual abuse, but \\"It has not yet hit the surface of public interest and discussion and news in 75 per cent of countries, if not more. I cannot say where or when it will hit, but it will hit.\\" In February 2019, Hans Zollner co-organized the \\"Abuse Summit\\" in Rome. The gathering consisted of Pope Francis and presidents of bishops' conferences meeting with experts on best practices for handling abuse cases in the Catholic Church.

This station straddles the Lander River and is adjacent to the Tanami Desert. History This station was formerly established on Anmatyerre tribal lands by James Wickham in 1940 when he obtained leases over several areas he previously held under grazing licences. Wickham ran Willowra in partnership with Robert Edward Davis and by 1946 they were running 2000 head of cattle. Davis was charged for the murder of two Aboriginal men in December 1943, one of whom was named Chuckara. Davis was acquitted in July 1945. In 1946, Willowra was sold to Jack Parkinson for ‚Ç§12,000. He began to develop the station in earnest and by 1953 it boasted six wells, one bore, and five yards. The initial homestead was a Sidney Williams hut but this was soon to be replaced with a new building made of concrete bricks on site. Parkinson was charged for stealing calves from Anningie Station in 1951. He was found not guilty. Parkinson was then charged for shooting an Aboriginal man Johny Granite, \\"with intent to do grevious bodily harm\\". Parkinson allegedly shot at Granite after ongoing incidents of theft and violence towards his former partner, a woman named Mavis. The case was dismissed as evidence given by Granite was \\"almost impossible to follow\\". Parkinson died in 1958 and his son Edgar took over running Willowra, along with adjoining Mt Barkly. Despite drought he continued to develop the station and by 1962 his herd, improvements, and maintenance was described as excellent. In 1972, Willowra received national publicity when it was one of several stations proposed to be acquired on behalf of the Indigenous traditional owners, of whom 150 lived on the property. The proposal, initiated in the last days of the McMahon government, was implemented in 1973. In 1979, Willowra was subjected to land claim and after this process the station became Aboriginal Freehold.

The second generation was announced at the Pixel 4 hardware event on October 15, 2019, and was released in the United States on November 4, 2019. Google Nest Wifi aims to provide enhanced Wi-Fi coverage through the setup of multiple Nest Wifi devices in a home. Nest Wifi automatically switches between access points depending on signal strength. Nest Wifi can be purchased as a single unit or in a multi-pack.  History  =First generation= Android Police reported in September 2016 that Google was preparing to introduce a mesh-capable wireless router with enhanced range, along with its October 4 date of announcement and US$129 price point. Google Wifi was officially announced on October 4, 2016, with expected availability in the United States in December. The device became available in the United States on December 5, 2016, in the United Kingdom on April 6, 2017, in Canada on April 28, 2017, in France and Germany on June 26, 2017, in Australia on July 20, 2017, in Hong Kong and Singapore on 30 August, 2017, and in Philippines on June 26th, 2018.https://businessmirror.com.ph/google-wifi- arrives-in-the-philippines/ The first generation Google Wifi features 802.11ac connectivity with 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz channels, 2x2 antennas, and support for beamforming. It has two gigabit Ethernet ports, and contains a quad-core processor with 512 MB RAM and 4 GB flash memory. Wi-Fi access can be controlled through a companion mobile app. =Second generation= The second generation of the product was officially announced at the Pixel 4 hardware event on October 15, 2019, renamed as Google Nest Wifi as part of the company's shift towards its rebranding of all its smart home products to the Google Nest name. It combines a smart speaker along with its Wi-Fi capabilities.  Users blocked from accessing the device  In April 2019 some users started reporting that Google Wifi's settings are not accessible. Google responded in the forums that users that have their App Store set to a country that is not in a specific list cannot download their application anymore and change settings of their installed devices. This sparked a wave of consumer criticism of Google effectively blocking users out of their purchased devices. https://support.google.com/wifi/thread/3787129  Reception  James Trew of Engadget praised the ease of setup for the device, writing that \\"Setting up a router isn't usually that hard, but it often involves an ugly web admin panel that -- ironically for a device that helps you enjoy the internet -- looks like it was designed in 2003. You'll set Google WiFi up with an app\\" and described the process as \\"all very simple and painless\\". Trew also liked the design, calling it \\"nice\\" and compared it to other routers by writing that \\"A quick internet search for \\"wireless router\\" returns a slew of angular black boxes with ugly antennas that might look okay in an office or basement, but nowhere else\\" and stated that \\"Google WiFi's white cylindrical design, however, is fairly unremarkable, and that's precisely the point\\". For performance, Trew was surprised to find that Google Wifi gave him a considerably higher speed than his previous router, describing it as \\"almost tripling the transfer rate of my old router every time\\". He also praised the app's ability to easily add more units around a house, the ability to manually prioritize what devices should get the highest Internet speed and the mesh network's capabilities of automatically switching between access points. However, he criticized the lack of a website interface and noted that the device might not be suitable for advanced users but rather \\"for people who don't enjoy navigating the typical router admin console (or don't even know that their router has one)\\". Dong Ngo of CNET also praised the setup process, describing it as \\"self-explanatory, and dare I say, fun\\". Ngo also praised speed, calling it \\"fast\\" and that the coverage and reliability provided by the mesh system was \\"great\\". Similarly to Trew, Ngo criticized the lack of proper customization features, calling it \\"frustrating\\" and elaborating that \\"You can't do as much with the Wifi as you can with a regular router. To name a few, there's no MAC filtering, content filtering, or even support for Dynamic DNS (DDNS)\\". Ngo also noted that the Wifi system is connected to a user's Google account \\"at all times\\", meaning that, while security updates can be provided on a regular basis, the \\"constant connection to Google is required. That's a dealbreaker for some\\". Dan Seifert of The Verge reiterated praise for design, writing \\"each unit is a compact, unobtrusive cylinder that can be tucked away on a shelf or counter and doesn‚Äôt look like a piece of computer equipment in the middle of your living room\\", and also for the setup, describing it as \\"painless and took about 10 minutes total to complete\\". Seifert wrote that \\"In each room, Google Wifi was able to provide a strong wireless signal and enough internet bandwidth for the most demanding streaming needs\\" and complimented the system for being able to provide his bedroom with decent speeds, despite it being \\"the furthest room\\" and the \\"hardest test\\" in his home. He noted that, while the app shows which access point a device is connected to, it \\"doesn‚Äôt allow you to force devices to hop from one to another\\". Overall, Seifert stated that \\"If all you care about is raw performance, [Netgear] Orbi is a better router, but for overall experience, including cost and maintenance, Google Wifi is an easier system to use\\".

Until the early modern period magical powers were accepted as part of the general lifestyle, but witch-hunts began on the mainland of Scotland in about 1550, and the Scottish Witchcraft Act of 1563 made witchcraft or consultation with witches a crime punishable by death. One of the first Orcadians tried and executed for witchcraft was Allison Balfour, in 1594. Balfour, her elderly husband and two young children, were subjected to severe torture for two days to elicit a confession from her. Trials were generally held in St Magnus Cathedral where the accused were also incarcerated while being interrogated. Once convicted, witches were taken to Gallow Ha to be executed by strangulation and then their bodies were burned. Early laws also allowed the seizure of any property or belongings of those guilty of any crimes associated with witchcraft; this was manipulated to suit whatever purpose the ruling Earls such as Patrick Stewart, 2nd Earl of Orkney had in mind, and left much of the island's population destitute. These laws were overturned in 1611 but were replaced by Scottish law, causing a shift from the exploitation by the Earls to the administration of justice by the Bishop's court of James Law, a fervent minister from West Lothian. The reforms instituted by the restoration of the Bishops had a significant impact but failed to introduce any neutrality into the proceedings against those accused of witchcraft during the most intensive period of witch-hunting on the island from 1615 until 1645. The new court regime produced varying results regarding punishments passed down: the first trial held on 7 June 1615 was against two women from Westray, both were deemed guilty but one was sentenced to be banished after a severe public flogging while the other was tied to a stake, strangled and burned. Charges in cases varied but the slightest misdemeanour could lead to charges of witchcraft and devilry being brought and upheld. If confessions of associations with the Devil were not forthcoming, convictions were obtained on the basis of consorting with fairies. In 1616 Elspeth Reoch was found guilty and executed after she admitted having sexual intercourse with a fairy man. Mirroring the time span of witch persecution on the mainland of Scotland, the trials in Orkney drew to an end in 1708; most took place prior to 1650. Sixty-eight people had been accused, the majority ‚Äì around ninety percent ‚Äì were women, a higher ratio than that recorded in the rest of the country. Background The islanders of Orkney had a long tradition of belief in broadly construed forms of witchcraft, sorcery, and supernatural creatures, possibly stretching back to the arrival of the first Norse settlers. The date the Norse first began to settle Orkney is not certainly known, although it likely occurred prior to the first written records of their appearance in north Britain, which date to the late eighth century. Magical powers were accepted as part of the general lifestyle and were not questioned. Superstitious island farmers attributed poor harvests or the loss of their stock to the malevolence of witches. Gradually attitudes began to change; theologians suggested that those with mystical powers were devil worshippers and it was heresy. Components of local folk tales were associated with witches by ministers who suggested the alleged witches were working with fairies and other supernatural creatures. It was common for inquisitors to transcribe the word devil or demon in place of any appellation for a fairy an alleged witch may have used in their statement. In Scotland witch-hunts began around 1550; the parliament of Mary, Queen of Scots passed the Scottish Witchcraft Act in 1563 making witchcraft convictions a capital punishment. Although the Orkney archipelago was officially under Norwegian law until 1611, at which time it was abolished by an act of the Privy Council of Scotland, it had been held by Scotland from 1468 under the rule of Scottish earls. Patrick Stewart, 2nd Earl of Orkney, known as Black Patie, had control of the islands in 1594 at the time of the initial witch trials but later trials were overseen by James Law who took on the role of sheriff after he had been appointed Bishop of Orkney by King James. In contrast to the mainland where the Privy Council oversaw trials, there are no records of it having any involvement on Orkney where, from 1615, the Procurator Fiscal instigated hearings in the Sheriff Court or they were heard by the church elders. The Witchcraft Act not only allowed the execution of witches but also those who sought advice from them. Patie treated the islanders with contempt and tended to impose extremely heavy penalties on the advice seekers. When the Privy Council questioned him about it in 1609, he replied that without the severe penalties the islanders \\"wald all have becommit witches and warlockis for the people ar naturally inclynit thairto\\". King James also considered Orkney as one of the places where sorcery and magic were widespread, mentioning it in his book Daemonologie. Early to mid-19th century sailors held a similar conviction concerning the archipelago: Walter Traill Dennison, a folklorist and native of Sanday, born in 1825, had been taken on an excursion to Leith as a child. An elderly sailor sat the boy on his lap while recounting him a tale; when he discovered Traill Dennison was a visitor from Orkney, he recoiled from him in fear crying \\"O, my lad, you hail from that lubber land where so many cursed witches dwell.\\" Early trials Only sparse information is available on witch trials in Orkney prior to 1612, yet the first of two connected witchcraft trials associated with Orkney, held in 1594 and 1596, has been described by the academic historian Julian Goodare as \\"one of Scotland's most frequently-cited witchcraft cases.\\" Admissions of guilt were an integral part of witchcraft trials in Scotland and torture was often used until the practice was discontinued in 1708. Allison Balfour, who lived in an area of Stenness known as Ireland, had been asked for advice on how best to cast a spell on Patie by his brothers and friends who were plotting to kill him. Together with her aged husband, son and seven-year-old daughter, Balfour was subjected to extensive torture for forty-eight hours. She finally confessed but was found guilty of conspiring to murder by the use of witchcraft and was sentenced to be strangled and burned. On 16 December 1594 she was executed despite having retracted her confession. The majority of trials were held in St Magnus Cathedral. Prisoners may also have been held captive in the Cathedral; a roofed cell-like area, often referred to as Marwick's-hole, is set between the side wall and the south transept chapel. Above the north and south chapels, on the second floor, are small rooms that may have been utilised as cells too. Convicted witches were executed on Gallow Ha, an area in Kirkwall located at the top of a street called Clay Loan. Early Norwegian law dating back to the 11th century stipulated that anyone declared guilty of sorcery or associated crimes would forfeit all their possessions; records in Orkney for the period around 1602‚Äì04 detail land seized due to crimes of witchcraft. Like his father before him Patie had no compunction about seizing land from lowly islanders; the law was manipulated to suit his own desires leaving much of the population destitute. Court papers frequently show the status of an accused islander as a vagabond, some having been forced into that lifestyle after being banished from their local community. Convictions and fines utilising the Lawburrows Act were often imposed by Patie but were rarely listed as such. The Rentals of the Ancient Earldom and Bishoprick of Orkney for 1595 indicate that two women, Jonet of Cara from South Ronaldsay ‚Äì whose possessions had been seized by Patie ‚Äì and another who is simply listed as \\"Alisoun Margaret's daughter\\" from Thurvoe were burned for witchcraft in or around 1595. The same document records Anne Marsetter of Halkland in Rendall, Elspet Marsetter of Wosbuster in South Sandwick and Robert Ness from the Ireland area of Stenness as being witches. Later trials The court reforms instigated by James Law, the Bishop of Orkney, impacted significantly on the witch trials in Orkney. The early years of the 17th century were a period of political turmoil. James Law, a fervent minister from Kirkliston in West Lothian, was appointed Bishop of Orkney by King James in 1605. Eventually subjugated by Bishop Law, Black Patie was incarcerated and then executed after he enraged King James; Patie's illegitimate son, Robert, was also executed after he was forced to surrender following a siege at Kirkwall Castle in 1614. In addition, the old Norse Laws were officially replaced by the laws of Scotland in 1611 and, according to the scholar Robert Barclay, while \\"the earl's court had manipulated the law, the bishop's court now administered justice\\". The most intensive period during which the witches were persecuted on Orkney was from 1615 until 1645. The historian Liv Helene Willumsen considers the court reforms instigated by Bishop Law around 1614 and the restoration of the bishops impacted significantly on the witch trials, but failed to improve the neutrality of the proceedings. On 7 June 1615 the new court regime saw the first instance of charges being levelled for \\"the abohminable and divelishe cryme of witchcraft\\". The two accused women, Jonet Drever and Katherene Bigland, both from Westray, were declared guilty at their joint trial held in Kirkwall but with differing sentences. Drever confessed to having 26 years earlier conversed with fairies, that she left a child in the care of the fairy folk who she called \\"our good neighbours and in having carnal dealings with her.\\" Orcadian historian Ernest Marwick considered part of the phrasing used in the accusations made against Bigland to be ambiguous; it could be interpreted as Bigland acting as lookout while a gathering of witches took place in the churchyard. Instead he read the meaning to be she was \\"accused of raising a procession of the dead\\". She had also washed her master with salt water after taking him down to the shoreline as it was thought to have medicinal properties; his illness was allegedly caused by Bigland, who then cured him by inflicting the sickness on his servant but she then transferred it back to the master again. The punishment ordered for Drever was that she be severely flogged in public the following afternoon then banished whereas Bigland was bound to a stake, strangled and burned. The type of accusation made against Bigland, the curing or being responsible for the illness of livestock or people, was the most common charge against alleged witches until 1650. During that period fourteen islanders were accused of causing or being responsible for the death of a person, and thirteen for bringing about the death of an animal. Charges were brought if the accused was known to have disliked someone who died or if they had been heard muttering threats against others. Katherine Craigie of Rousay was tried twice, first in 1640 and again in 1643; among her alleged misdeeds was that she had accurately predicted a man she had a dispute with would die within a year. When the claim was causing the death of animals, an alleged witch being seen near the barns or pastures where livestock were accommodated provided adequate grounds for prosecution. Generally even tentative evidence indicating any association with the Devil or the merest connection to curing disease was \\"devilrie and witchcraft.\\" At the trial of Jonet Rendall in 1629 the charges against her alleged she received her healing powers from the Devil. He had a grey beard, was dressed in white with a head of the same colour yet a few years later at the trial against Marion Richart from Sanday in 1633, the Devil she was meeting with had the \\"likeness of a black man\\".Miscellany of the Abbotsford Club, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1837), pp. 150-163. Rendall and Richart were both convicted and sentenced to be strangled and burned. If the evidence did not show connections to the Devil, the courts would convict on tales of involvement with fairies. At her trial in 1616 Elspeth Reoch admitted to having several rendezvous with the Devil who had assumed the form of a fairy; she said one of the meetings she had with the Devil occurred on Halloween. Her confession stated that when she was twelve years old she had met two men near a loch; after she produced an illegitimate child, one of the men appeared again at her bedside. She admitted that she had sexual intercourse with the \\"Farie man\\". At one of the meetings she had with him, he informed her that \\"Orkney was Priestgone, as there were too many ministers in it.\\" Reoch was found guilty and executed. Decline Witch trials continued on Orkney until 1708, a similar time span to that on the mainland of Scotland, although the majority of Orcadian trials took place prior to 1650, when witch-hunting on the archipelago virtually came to an end. Accusations were made against sixty- eight people. The highest number of cases heard in one year was during 1643 when twenty-four individuals were accused of witchcraft or using charms. Around ninety percent of the witchcraft allegations in Orkney were brought against women, a higher proportion than seen on the mainland. Any accusations levelled against men were all related to cases dealing with women.

Life Ada Elizabeth Edith Swanwick was born in Forest Hill in London in 1915. Her father, Henry Gerard Swanwick, who was in the naval reserve, painted marine watercolours. She was inspired by her father, and her mother, Ethel Priscilla (n√©e Bacon), gave her pencils which she had retrieved from shipwrecks on the Scilly Isles. Swanwick enrolled at Goldsmiths College at the age of fifteen and by 1934 she was simultaneously attending classes at Goldsmith's, the Royal College of Art and the Central School of Arts and Crafts. She was a student of Edward Bawden. This academic activity continued until 1936.

She would later create another mural for Evelina Children's Hospital in 1960. A painting by Swanwick titled The Dream was used on the cover of the 1973 Genesis album Selling England by the Pound. The original painting did not include a lawn mower; the band had Swanwick add it later as an allusion to the track \\"I Know What I Like\\", because Swanwick told them she did not have enough time to paint a new picture for the cover. Her drawings could take 200 hours to create and she had strong views. She was appalled to find that her students did not have to attend life drawing classes. Swanwick died in 1989.

The church is a Grade I listed building built on a site dating back to the 13th century within the grounds of Barking Abbey, the ruins of a former royal monastery that was originally established in the 7th century. The building is dedicated to Margaret the Virgin. History =Medieval= It originated as a chapel for local people within the grounds of Barking Abbey, to the south of the Abbey church. Its oldest part is the chancel, built early in the 13th century during the reign of King John. The building is said to have been made into a parish church in 1300 by Anne de Vere, abbess of the Abbey.Essex Record Office, T/P 93/2 f. 193. Until the 1390s Barking formed a rectory, held by the Abbey and divided into two vicarages known as 'Northstrete' (probably funded by income from the Ilford area) and 'Southstrete' (serving the Abbey church). The area suffered severe flooding in the late 14th century, leading to financial difficulties and a merger of the two vicarages from 1398 onwards.'The ancient parish of Barking: Abbeys and churches founded before 1830', in A History of the County of Essex: Volume 5, ed. W R Powell (London, 1966), pp. 222‚Äì231.. A chaplain from the Abbey led worship. The present bell tower was added late in the 15th century. =Reformation= It remained a parish church when the Abbey was dissolved and the rectory and advowson devolved to the Crown, who initially leased it to the widow Mary Blackenhall for 21 years in 1540. In 1557 these were bought by Robert Thomas and Andrew Salter using money from the estate of William Pownsett of nearby Loxford, and granted to All Souls College, Oxford, in return for the vicar praying for the souls of Pownsett, his parents and benefactors every Sunday, giving 6 shillings and 8 pence amongst twenty poor people annually on the anniversary of Pownsett's death, paying the College an annual sum to maintain two poor scholars and only being absent from the parish 80 or fewer days a year. The College presented when the next vacancy occurred in 1560, but at the following one the Crown contested its right, though this was overturned via a lawsuit. Sir John Petre reconfirmed the 1557 grant in 1594, but dropped the requirement to pray for the dead. The right is now shared between All Souls College, Oxford, the Bishop of Chelmsford (in whose diocese it now falls) and the church's churchwardens. =17th century to 20th century= The church contains several memorials, including one to the 17th- century politician Charles Montagu. The explorer James Cook married Elizabeth Batts in the church on 21 December 1762. Ten years later the nave, chancel and sanctuary all had their ceilings plastered, though this was removed from the nave ceiling in 1842. Charles Winmill and George Jack were involved in a restoration of the interior between 1929 and 1936. The building was Grade I listed in 1954. An extension was added along the south side late in the 20th century to provide an office, bookshop and refectory. Present day The church is now one of three in a team parish covering Barking ‚Äì the other two are Christ Church and St Patrick's. The parish is unusual in having three churchwardens rather than the more normal two. In 2007, two small stones from remains of the old medieval London Bridge were joined together in a sculpture in front of St Margaret's church facing the Barking Abbey ruins as part of several public artworks placed in Barking Town Centre by artist Joost Van Santen. Notable clergy Many vicars of Barking have gone on to become bishops. Hugh Jermyn was Bishop of Colombo 1871‚Äì1875 and Bishop of Brechin 1875‚Äì1903, and Primus of Scotland 1886‚Äì1901.

The association has launched its own social media too: Framasph√®re. In , a new functionality was added to Framapad to avoid flooding servers with unused text. It became also possible to choose the data conservation time. In the meantime, the association developed a picture sharing tool (FramaPic) and an URL shortener (Huit.re / frama.link). Framasoft also took the opportunity to start their own code body hosting called Forge. In May 2015, Framasoft started a new Web search engine service (Framabee), in order to continue demonstrating that alternatives to Google are possible. In , phase 2 of the De-google-ify campaign started and lead into the release of 6 new services: * Framalistes: managing mailing lists * Framanotes: dealing with all sorts of contents * Framaforms: managing forms * Framatalk: audio/video chat * Framagenda: creating public or private calendars In 2019, they started developing Mobilizon, a project to allow communities to organise events without depending on tech giants‚Äô platforms.  The organization of the network  The association \\"Framasoft\\" was founded in January 2004, about 3 years after first the publication of the web site. Since Framasoft was becoming a large collaborative project, it became necessary to provide all the technical parts of a growing network, like ownership of domain names associated with a moral person, to accompany projects in a coherent way so they are part of a whole (starting with guarantee the open-source and free nature of the created resources) and also to represent Framasoft through more and more interventions in the field. This association aims \\"to promote and disseminate the free culture and especially the open-source software culture\\". The founding is mainly based upon gift economy from users, collected through the Internet. The association take part in many events, whether while giving conferences, or having a place, for example during the \\"Rencontres mondiales du logiciel libre\\" (RMLL, from 2004 until 2014), the first \\"Rencontres mondiales d√©centralis√©es du logiciel libre\\" in Saint-Joseph on the island of R√©union (from 2006 until 2014), \\"Paris Capitale du Libre\\" (from 2006 until 2008), the \\"Salon de l'√âducation\\" (from 2004 until 2006), the \\"F√™te de l'Humanit√©\\" (from 2004 until 2009, and 2014) and also during many Install parties and local \\"Freeware Day\\" organized by GULL, like \\"Ubuntu Party\\" in Paris (from 2008 until 2011) and in Toulouse (from 2009 to 2010) or like JDLL in Lyon (from 2007 until 2010). The association is a member of the April, of Wikimedia France and of the association of French-speaking freeware users AFUL. It collaborates with websites like Linuxfr, La Quadrature du Net, the Tristan Nitot Standblog or the formats ouverts's blog about open formats by Thierry St≈ìhr.

It is a rare ground orchid with a single hairy leaf and a single yellow flower. Description Caladenia audasii is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single hairy leaf, long and wide. A single yellow flower in diameter is borne on a spike high. The petals and sepals are long and spreading, the petals somewhat shorter than the sepals. The petals and lateral sepals are wide and taper to a thread-like end covered with glandular hairs. The labellum is curved with the tip rolled under and has erect lateral lobes. It is about long and wide when flattened. The edges of the labellum are scalloped and the middle lobe has short, broad teeth. There are six rows of stalkless calli along the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from September to November. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Richard Rogers in 1927 and the description was published in Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of South Australia. The type specimen was collected on Mount McIvor near Bendigo. The specific epithet (audasii) honours James Wales Clarendon Audas, a member of staff at the National Herbarium of Victoria. Distribution and habitat Only five plants of this orchid species were known in 2000, growing in grassy Box‚Äìironbark forest in three disjunct populations near Bendigo, Kingower and Deep Lead north-west of Stawell. It is extinct in South Australia. In June 2015, thirty new plants were introduced into the Greater Bendigo National Park.

Description  Amanita spreta is usually distinguished by its grayish brown cap with dark, radial streaks; its medium to large size, the presence of a ring on the upper stem, and its stem base, in which it features a white, sacklike volva and is not prominently swollen. Its ellipsoid, inamyloid spores also help to distinguish it. = Cap = The cap of A. spreta measures around 58 ‚Äì 154 mm (5.8 - 15.4 cm) wide, with whitish or pallid tints of gray and/or brown at first, often darkening to gray-brown or brown-gray, often darkest in the center, often white or nearly white at the margin, having minute colorless spots and/or giving the impression of densely placed radial fibers embedded in the cap skin. In addition, the cap is broadly campanulate to plano-convex, and eventually has a large umbo in a slight depression. The cap is viscid to tacky and dull to shiny to subshiny with drying, and it has a decurved, short- striate margin. The volva is either absent or present as white to pale gray, scant, irregular patches, soft to smooth, easily removable, and membranous. The flesh is white, pale brown under the cap skin in the center, is 8 ‚Äì 17 mm (0.8 - 1.7 cm) thick over the stem, and is thinning evenly nearing the margin. = Gills = The gills are free, receding at maturity, very crowded to crowded, pale cream to cream to white, 8 ‚Äì 19 mm broad, broadest at the midpoint, anastomosing, with faint and short decurrent lines on the top of the stem, and with a minutely powdery edge. The short gills are truncate to rounded truncate to subtruncate, unevenly distributed, of diverse lengths, and plentiful (sometimes more plentiful than full-length gills). The short gills can be adjacent to the stipe or adjacent to the cap margin or neither. = Stem = The stem of A. spreta is 5‚Äì10 cm long, up to 2 cm thick, tapering slightly to apex, is whitish, sometimes discoloring a little brownish; finely hairy to shaggy; with a white, skirtlike ring that may discolor brownish; with a slightly enlarged but not bulbous base that is set in a sack-like, flaring or lobed, white volva.

It has been Grade II* listed since 1951. History =Beginnings= West door inscription William Henry, 2nd Baron Leigh gave the site for the church. It was built with funds from John Hubbard, 1st Baron Addington,Bernard Palmer, Reverend Rebels: Five Victorian Clerics and their Fight Against Authority, (London, Darton, Longman & Todd, 1993), p.78 and designed by William Butterfield in 1859. Construction occurred between 1861 and 1862 in yellow and red stock bricks with stone dressings and tiled roofs. In 1862 Alexander Mackonochie became its first perpetual curate. He introduced a daily Eucharist, which featured Gregorian chant and significant ritual elements (e.g. the lighting of altar candles and the cleansing of eucharistic vessels at the altar). St Alban's was the first Anglican church to hold the three-hour devotion on Good Friday (in 1864) and one of the first to celebrate a Harvest Festival. Mackonochie also openly heard confessions. Mackonochie's pastoral ministry was typical of the 19th-century ritualist \\"slum priest\\". With his two curates, Arthur Stanton (who remained at the church until his death in 1913) and Edward Russell, and lay assistants he founded schools, soup kitchens, a working men's club, mothers' meetings, clothing funds and more. Though he remained until 1882 and remained as an assistant priest after that date, he became known as \\"the martyr of St Alban's\\" for regular Low Church prosecutions against his support for ritualism.Michael Reynolds, Martyr of Ritualism: Father Mackonochie of St. Alban‚Äôs, Holborn (London: Faber and Faber, 1965) In 1891 a chapel was added to designs by Charles Henry Money Mileham (1837‚Äì1917), with the chapel's stained glass by Charles Eamer Kempe added in 1898 ‚Äì it now also contains two Stations of the Cross by Ninian Comper. The 1890s also saw the future bishop Hensley Henson (then vicar of St Margaret's Church, Barking) frequently visiting St Alban's as a guest preacher.\\"Bishop Hensley Henson ‚Äì Master of Dialectic\\", The Times, 29 September 1947, p. 27 =1900‚Äìpresent= 'Jesus Being Raised From the Dead' by Hans Feibusch In 1938 the church hosted England's first complete performance of Olivier Messiaen's La Nativit√© du Seigneur, organised by Felix Aprahamian and played by the composer himself. The church was burned out during the London Blitz in 1941, though the chapel survived. The main church was restored by Adrian Gilbert Scott between 1959 and 1961, including a new organ by John Compton. Beside the church's entrance is a 1985 sculpture by Hans Feibusch entitled 'Jesus being Raised from the Dead' ‚Äì the same artist had produced the church's current set of Stations of the Cross (date unknown) and a mural of the Holy Trinity for the east wall (1966).

After 1945 he chose an academic career, becoming a university professor and economist, while also engaging in the Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime (\\"Vereinigung der Verfolgten des Naziregimes\\") and its successor organisation. Life =Early years= Kurt Langendorf was born in L√∂rrach and grew up in the Mannheim area. His parents, Rudolf Langendorf (1894-1942) and Antonie Langendorf (1894-1969) were both founder members of the Communist Party. According to one source Kurt Langendorf received his name to honour Kurt Eisner, the murdered leader of the short-lived Munich Soviet Republic. Kurt and his brother, Hans, became conscious of their parents' activism at an early age: their childhood was a politicised one. =Nazi years= In January 1933, when Kurt Langendorf was 12, the Nazis took power. His father was taken into \\"protective custody\\" in March 1933 and his mother soon afterwards. They were both released during (or possibly before) 1935 and restored their contacts with \\"fellow antifascists\\". Kurt Langendorf was able to take and pass his school final exams (Abitur). The authorities attempted to \\"turn him politically\\", but subsequent research in Gestapo files indicate an awareness that he had not been \\"turned\\". He is identified in Gestapo reports of the time as a \\"dog that takes orders from Moscow\\" (\\"ein moskauh√∂riger Hund\\"), but evidently the authorities had no sufficient evidence to proceed actively against him. In fact, he exhibited practical and valuable skills, constructing and maintaining radio receivers enabling his parents and their political associates to listen (illegally) to broadcasts transmitted from London and Moscow. He also led a form of double life, acting as a courier, taking messages to Switzerland, where his mother had relatives. War broke out a few days after his nineteenth birthday. In 1940 Kurt Langendorf was conscripted into the army and for a time seriously contemplated escaping across the Swiss border and seeking refuge with relatives. He was persuaded by comrades to respond positively to the call-up, however, in order to acquire military knowledge and pursue antifascist political work with fellow soldiers. Sources state that he undertook anti-Nazi resistance work in the army without spelling out what this involved. However, his father was arrested in February 1942, sentenced in May 1942 and, on 15 September 1942, executed. Three days later his mother was re-arrested and taken into custody. Kurt Langendorfer himself was identified as \\"politically unreliable\\" and transferred to a Punishment squadron. In July 1943, caught up in the Battle of Kursk, he attempted to cross over and join the Red Army. Langendorf was shot and rendered unconscious: after the front line had rolled back and forth for several days he was found by German soldiers and taken to the field hospital. The surgeon who extracted the bullet advised him to retain it: it came from a German revolver. (It was only in much later, in 1990, that he discovered that army records of the time had reported him as dead.) By the end of 1944, after further military service, he found himself before a military court following further various malfeasances and was sentenced to a further five years in a Punishment squadron. One of his misdemeanours had been to announce to an aristocratic senior officer, during a training course for junior officers, that the Second World War would be won by Germany because Goebbels, the government propaganda minister, was the greater liar. Early in 1945, as the German army fell apart, he made a successful escape. He was captured by US soldiers and spent two months in the infamous concentration camp at Bad Kreuznach. Nevertheless, he had survived the war, as had his mother, who had spent the final months of the war in the Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp, and now returned to Mannheim. His father had been executed and his brother Hans had been shot dead while trying to change sides. For Kurt Langendorf, still aged only 24, it was time for a new start. =After the war= Langendorf now set about obtaining a university place to study engineering at Karlsruhe, not far from his mother's Mannheim home. Karlsruhe rejected his application. Buchenwald survivors now invited him to enroll at Jena to study Physics. He accepted the invitation, although he soon switched to Economics. Moving to Jena meant moving to the Soviet occupation zone - relaunched in October 1949 as the German Democratic Republic - which is where he lived and worked till his retirement in 1985. As a citizen of the Soviet occupation zone Langendorf became a member of the Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime (\\"Vereinigung der Verfolgten des Naziregimes\\") subsequently relaunched as the Anti-fascist league (\\" Bund der Antifaschistinnen und Antifaschisten\\"). He also joined the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED), launched under questionable circumstances in April 1946, and by October 1949 widely seen as the ruling party in a new kind of one-party German dictatorship. He received his first degree in 1951. After this he remained at Jena through most of the 1950s, teaching political economics and, by 1954, as the Director of an Institute at the university. In 1954 he embarked on a two year study visit to China. This formed the basis for his doctoral dissertation on the socialist transformation of capitalist industry during the change-over period to socialism in the People's Republic of China. His oral defence of his work and subsequent award of the doctorate followed on 15 May 1959. The doctorate was awarded not by his university but by the Party Central Committee's Academy for Social Sciences. In 1965 he received his habilitation (higher academic qualification) from the Humboldt University of Berlin, where by now he was teaching, and where in 1964 he had been given a teaching chair. His dissertation, on this occasion, concerned wages theory and planning in the new economic system (\\"Zur Theorie des Lohnes und der Lohnplanung im neuen √∂konomischen System\\") His full professorship at the followed in 1968. Subsequently he took also a professorship with the \\"Fritz Heckert trades union college\\" in Bernau bei Berlin, where he continued to work till his retirement in 1985. Retirement left more time for activities involving former victims of the Nazi regime. He joined the local committee of the East German antifascist resistance fighters in Berlin-Wei√üensee. After the demise of the separate East German state, in 1990 he was a co-founder of the \\"Berlin Association of former participants in Anti-fascist Resistance, victims and survivors of Nazi persecution\\" (\\"Berliner Vereinigung ehemaliger Teilnehmer am antifaschistischen Widerstand, Verfolgter des Naziregimes und Hinterbliebener\\" / B. V. VdN), and he took on its chairmanship in 2004. He gave s succession of newspaper interviews, always keen to deal with the background and causes of German fascism. Kurt Langendorf died in Berlin on 2 July 2011.

C. Gainey on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) television series Lost. The series follows the lives of around forty survivors from the crash of Oceanic Flight 815. The survivors find themselves on a mysterious tropical island, and interact with a group known as the Others, who appear to have lived on the island since long before the crash. Tom is an influential member of the Others, and is introduced in 2005 in the season one finale \\"Exodus: Part 2\\", where he kidnaps one of the survivors. The character makes another fifteen appearances before being killed in the season three finale \\"Through the Looking Glass\\". Tom appears twice in season four in the flashbacks of other characters. Gainey was initially credited as playing \\"bearded man\\" and then as \\"Mr. Friendly\\" throughout season two before the character was given a first name. In a montage of deceased characters shown at Comic-Con in 2009, the Lost producers present the character's full name as \\"Tom Friendly\\". Gainey accepted the role despite knowing nothing about it; his sole motivation was a chance to work again with Lost producer Carlton Cuse. Speculation over Tom's sexuality arose when he commented to Kate that she was \\"not [his] type\\". Gainey began playing the character as such, and in season four Tom is shown kissing another man on the cheek. Lost producer Damon Lindelof commented that this revelation was \\"not subtle, to say the least\\". Tom was received positively by critics, particularly in his first appearance. Arc In a flashback during \\"The Other Woman\\", set around three years before the crash of Oceanic Flight 815, Tom has a brief conversation with newly recruited Other Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell), where he mentions he is a patient of therapist Harper Stanhope (Andrea Roth). Shown in flashbacks during \\"Maternity Leave\\", when Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin) is kidnapped by the Others a few weeks after the plane crash, Tom oversees Ethan Rom's (William Mapother) progress at the Others' medical station. He criticizes Ethan for kidnapping Claire before making \\"the list\\". After forty-four days on the Island, the survivors finish building a raft, with Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau), his ten-year-old son Walt Lloyd (Malcolm David Kelley), James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway) and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) volunteering to sail it. Tom makes his first appearance in \\"Exodus: Part 2\\", where he arrives in a motorboat, wearing a fake beard and old clothes, with a crew of Others who kidnap Walt and destroy the raft. When Michael goes searching for the Others in the jungle, Tom captures him, and then confronts the other survivors who are looking for Michael. Tom warns them not to come any closer to the Others and then leaves with Michael in tow. A deal is made for Michael to bring Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly), Sawyer and Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) to the Others in exchange for Walt. In the second season finale \\"Live Together, Die Alone\\", Michael successfully leads Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Hurley to the ambush point; various Others including Tom sedate them and take them to a pier. There, Tom knocks Jack, Kate and Sawyer unconscious and transports them to a small island nearby. In season three, Tom supervises an operation on Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), the leader of the Others, which Jack is performing, and is coerced into letting Kate and Sawyer escape. He loses trust in Juliet, believing her to be plotting against Ben, and expresses his views to the Others' sheriff, before returning to the Island. Shown in a flashback during season four, Tom leaves the Island and tracks down Michael in Manhattan, where Michael is trying to kill himself. He tells Michael that the Island will not let him die and gives him the address of his hotel penthouse. There, Tom convinces Michael to work for Ben, and instructs him to get a job as a janitor on board a freighter that is about to set sail from Fiji. When Michael arrives at the port Tom tells him to wait a day or two before activating an explosive device, to kill all the freighter crew, preventing them from reaching the Island. He returns to the barracks and is seen playing football with Jack. Shortly after this, he and the Others abandon the barracks, making camp in the jungle en route to the temple. Tom is shocked when Ben agrees to take one of the survivors, John Locke (Terry O'Quinn), to see Jacob, Ben's superior. His faith in Ben's leadership is shaken, and ignores Ben's calls to intervene when Locke begins to beat another Other, Mikhail Bakunin (Andrew Divoff). When Ben returns from Jacob, he orders a raid on the survivors' beach camp that night; Tom is part of the party sent. In \\"Through the Looking Glass\\", the season three finale, Jin, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) and Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson) are captured by the party, and Ben radios Tom to shoot them. This prearranged code is the signal for Tom to shoot three bullets into the ground, only pretending to kill the hostages, to mislead the rest of the survivors, who have been met by Ben. Afterwards Tom expresses regret at not finishing the hostages, as they killed seven of the Others. The arrival of Hurley in a van, along with Sawyer and Juliet, sees the rest of the attack party killed. Tom admits defeat and surrenders, but Sawyer shoots him in his heart, claiming his life as payment for taking Walt off the raft. Juliet later buries Tom near the jungle along with his team of deceased Others. Characteristics Tom wearing his fake beard in \\"Three Minutes\\" When Tom is introduced in the first season finale, he wears a fake beard and old clothes. He continues to appear under this guise throughout the second season, only revealing his beard to be fake in the finale. M. C. Gainey, the actor who portrays Tom, was only informed that his character's beard was fake near the end of season two. The producers describe Tom as \\"friendly\\", earning him the nickname \\"Mr. Friendly\\". One critic has described him as \\"sarcastic\\" and \\"bright\\". Tom's dislike of blood causes him to struggle while supervising Ben's operation, which Emerson believes makes him \\"cuddly\\".\\"Lost on Location: 'Not in Portland' \\".

Released on December 11, 2007 Gainey does not think he is very similar to Tom, commenting, \\"He seems to be very loyal and I'm a very loyal person so I have that in common, but other than that, I don't really know what he's about. He seems much more socially awkward than I am.\\" After Tom was revealed to be gay during season four, M. C.

Though written in the early 1790s, it was not published in its entirety until 1852, long after von Humboldt's death in 1835. It was a significant source for the ideas that John Stuart Mill popularized in his 1859 book On Liberty, and is discussed favorably by Mill in the third chapter of that work, \\"Of Individuality, as One of the Elements of Well-Being.\\"Mill, John Stuart (1859). On Liberty. Mill had access to an 1854 English translation under the title The Sphere and Duties of Government. Humboldt defines the criteria by which the permissible limits of the state's activities may be determined. His basic principle, like that of Mill, is that the only justification for government interference is the prevention of harm to others. He discusses in detail the role and limits of the state's responsibility for the welfare, security and morals of its citizens. Wilhelm von Humboldt describes his purpose in writing The Limits of State Action as: \\"The grand, leading principle, towards which every argument ‚Ä¶ unfolded in these pages directly converges, is the absolute and essential importance of human development in its richest diversity.\\"The Sphere and Duties of Government. Translated from the German of Baron Wilhelm von Humboldt, by Joseph Coulthard, Jun. (London: John Chapman, 1854). Many commentators believe that Humboldt‚Äôs discussion of issues of freedom and individual responsibility possesses greater clarity and directness than John Stuart Mill‚Äôs. ‚ÄúGermany‚Äôs greatest philosopher of freedom,‚Äù as F. A. Hayek called him, has an exuberance and attention to principle that make it a valuable introduction to classical liberal political thought. It is also crucial for an understanding of liberalism as it developed in Europe at the turn of the nineteenth century. Humboldt explores the role that liberty plays in individual development, discusses criteria for permitting the state to limit individual actions, and suggests ways of confining the state to its proper bounds. In so doing, he uniquely combines the ancient concern for human excellence and the modern concern for what has come to be known as negative liberty.

Characters listed high on a tier list of a specific game are considered to be powerful characters compared to lower-scoring characters, and are therefore more likely to be used during tournaments. Tier lists are popular in fighting games such as the Street Fighter and Super Smash Bros. series, and MOBA titles such as League of Legends and Dota 2, in addition to hero shooter titles such as Overwatch and Paladins. Methodology When a competitive game gets an update, a question that arises is how the changes in the game will affect the tier list. Even when no balancing changes actually took place, the inclusion of new characters or new systems can affect tier lists. In fighting games, the strength of a character is always held relative to that of other characters, meaning that something that is strong in one fighting game does not necessarily have to be strong in another. The metagame may shift over time as dominant strategies get overturned using less popular characters. Tier rankings may be listed using letter gradings. The competitive community surrounding Guilty Gear Xrd, for instance, ranks characters as 'S', 'S-', 'A+', and 'A', where 'S tiers' are particularly powerful and 'A tiers' less so. Major video game news websites such as The Daily Dot and Kotaku may publish their own tier lists for popular games. 'S' tier may mean \\"Superb\\" or \\"Super\\". For a game like Super Smash Bros. Melee, which was released in 2001 and has not been updated since, but is still popular in tournament settings, characters originally overpowered remain that way, due to their inability to receive character balancing updates. Different versions of the game may have different tier lists as well. The website Smashboards bases its yearly tier lists for the Super Smash Bros. series on polling results. Impact Maddy Myers of Kotaku noted that characters that are considered low-tier have an advantage over higher-tiered characters, as players have less experience dealing with low-tier characters and often underestimate them. Myers stated that \\"the element of surprise can only get you so far, but it's still an undeniable asset. And one that the bottom third of every tier list enjoys.\\" Already popular characters may also rise in tier lists because high-level players establish and iterate on their combos and techniques. Myers also noted that tier lists are less useful in team-based games, because character roles and team composition introduce a complex set of variables.

The company supplied gas and electricity nationally to homes and businesses until September 2020, when its customer accounts were sold to Centrica, the parent company of British Gas.  Structure and operations  The company is wholly owned by Nottingham City Council. Its role is to provide low-cost energy to households and address fuel poverty. It provides special tariffs to residents within the boundaries of Nottingham City Council and provides a socially orientated pricing structure to the whole of the UK. The company operates on a not-for-profit basis by keeping overheads as low as possible, and does not pay bonuses to directors. Any profits made are reinvested. The chair of the company's board is a Nottingham councillor. As a publicly owned energy company, the business aims to \\"champion the average person on the street, and make decisions that are morally and ethically right rather than trying to please shareholders\\". The company specialises in prepayment meters, as customers with these meters generally can least afford energy, are in fuel poverty or are some of the most vulnerable customers, but are proportionally charged more for it. The company has previously declined to increase these prices for those customers even though costs were increasing.  History  When Robin Hood Energy was launched in 2015 it was the UK's first publicly owned not-for-profit energy company. None had existed since the UK energy system was nationalised in 1948 under the Electricity Act 1947 and subsequently privatised in 1990 under the Electricity Act 1989. A number of employees were transferred from Nottingham City Council to Robin Hood Energy in February 2017. The council retained liability for 80% of those employees' pension costs. In the year to 31 March 2018, the company had 99 employees and made a small operating profit for the first time: the after-tax amount was ¬£202,000 on turnover of ¬£70.4m. In July 2018, the company announced that its electricity supplied to UK homes and businesses would be 100% renewable and it would also voluntarily enter into the Warm Home Discount scheme, which offers the elderly a payment of ¬£140 over the winter period to help with fuel bills. This is only mandatory for energy companies with more than 250,000 customers; Robin Hood Energy has a customer base half the size of this, but voluntarily began to offer the Warm Home Discount from 2018. In January 2019, the business was rated as second best in the UK for customer service as part of the annual Which? survey. As of January 2019, Robin Hood Energy had 130,000 customers. In September 2019, they failed to pass on ¬£9.5m in renewable energy subsidies to Ofgem, the industry regulator, which they had already collected from their customers. The Ofgem director implied that failure to settle this debt could mean losing their licence. Payment was made to Ofgem the next month, after the company obtained a ¬£9.5m interest-bearing loan from Nottingham City Council.  Closure  In September 2020, Nottingham City Council announced that the company would close, and customer accounts would be taken over by British Gas. The sale price would depend on how many customers switched to British Gas, but it was expected that the council would make a significant loss, leading to reports the same month that its debts were at risk of becoming unsustainable. Partnerships =White-label contracts= A large part of the business's growth is through public sector endorsement rather than price comparison sites. The Robin Hood Energy model in Nottingham has been taken to a number of other areas of the UK through local authority and council partnerships. The business works with like-minded councils, with a range of political control and geographical locations, who have an agenda to tackle fuel poverty and address unfairness within the energy market. Robin Hood Energy is the licensed supplier to several other councils or private businesses: *Angelic Energy (Islington Council) *Beam Energy (Barking and Dagenham Council) *CitizEN Energy (Southampton City Council & neighbouring councils) *Ebico (not-for- profit company) *Fosse Energy (Leicestershire County Council & Leicester City Council) *Great North Energy (Doncaster Council & Barnsley MBC) *The Leccy (Liverpool City Council) *RAM Energy (Derby City Council) *Southend Energy (Southend-on-Sea Borough Council) *White Rose Energy (Leeds City Council ) *Your Energy Sussex (West Sussex County Council & local authorities) = White Rose Energy = Robin Hood Energy partnered with Leeds City Council to establish as of September 2016 White Rose Energy, an initiative to provide affordable energy to residents in Leeds and Yorkshire. = Ebico = Robin Hood Energy was announced on 10 March 2017 as the new supply partner for not- for-profit energy provider and registered social enterprise Ebico. This began a transition of Ebico customers who opted-in to be transferred to new Ebico Zero Tariffs provided by Robin Hood Energy. In the decision to opt for a relationship with Robin Hood Energy, Ebico stated \\"we wanted to ensure our supply partner shared the same values as us; something Robin Hood Energy does in its mission to provide its customers with low-cost energy.\\" The decision by Ebico to end its partnership with its former supply partner SSE plc was due to SSE deciding to close Ebico's EquiGas/EquiPower tariffs to new sales. The partnership was welcomed by a number of prominent politicians including Jesse Norman MP, Minister for Energy and Industry; Dr. Alan Whitehead MP, Shadow Minister for Energy and Climate Change; and Callum McCaig MP, SNP Spokesperson on Energy.

Two prosecutions ‚Äì in 1999 and in 2000 ‚Äì were unsuccessful. Two inquiries were held that reported in 2001. Eighteen years after the crime, in October 2016, a conviction was made. This was only the second time in Scottish legal history that a person was tried twice for the same crime. This controversial case raised a number of complicated legal issues, including the double jeopardy rule, as well as institutional racism on the part of investigating police and prosecutors. It has parallels with the Stephen Lawrence murder in England. Murder Three men confronted Surjit Singh Chhokar on the night of 4 November 1998. Ronnie Coulter, his nephew Andrew Coulter and another man, David Montgomery, went to see Chhokar following a dispute over a ¬£100.17 Giro cheque. Chhokar was stabbed three times, with one wound piercing his heart. Chhokar collapsed in front of his partner Liz Bryce. Within days of the murder, the three suspects had been arrested. First trials In March 1999 the case was heard at the Glasgow High Court, although that had only led to a conviction of assault. Lord McCluskey, who was at the time Scotland's longest-serving judge, presided over the trial and was highly critical that only one person appeared in the dock. The Chhokar Family Justice Campaign was launched on 22 March. It received support from the father of Stephen Lawrence, a black teenager murdered in London in 1993. In November 2000 Andrew Coulter and David Montgomery were put on trial but acquitted. By now Aamer Anwar was spokesman for the family. In February 2001 Ronnie Coulter and Sandra Tierney were each given the maximum prison sentence for contempt of court and sentenced to two years' imprisonment. Inquiries into the system In October 2001 two reports were published. Solicitor Dr Raj Jandoo looked at the liaison arrangements between the police, the Crown office and procurator fiscal service and the relatives and partner of Mr Chhokar. Jandoo's report found that Strathclyde police had failed to investigate whether the murder was racially aggravated. The report contained forty recommendations. Sir Anthony Campbell, justice of the supreme court of Northern Ireland, looked at the crown office. Campbell did not unearth institutional racism, but did identify some failings and recommended nine major changes for the prosecuting authority. Chhokar's family had not cooperated with the authors of either of the reports. In 2012 the Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland instructed Strathclyde Police to look at the case again. Re-trial in 2016 In March 2015 Ronnie Coulter appeared at the High Court of Glasgow and was again charged with murder. Lord Bannatyne presided and Donald Findlay QC defended. The re-trial of Ronnie Coulter was held in October 2016 and lasted four weeks. Alex Prentice QC prosecuted, Donald Findlay QC defended, and Aamer Anwar acted for the Chhokar family. Coulter was eventually convicted of Chhokar's murder. On 31 October, Judge Lord Matthews sentenced Coulter to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 19 years and 8 months (twenty years, including the four months he had already spent in custody).HMA v Ronnie Coulter The following month he lodged a notice of his intention to appeal against his conviction and sentence with the Appeal Court in Edinburgh.

Early life and education  Dr. Guyot-Diangone speaks of her childhood in Washington, D.C., of what it was like growing up as the daughter of the U.S. Civil Rights Reformer Lawrence Guyot: \\"My dad would say, 'Everything is political.' So, while I call myself a social constructivist, it's really because it's not just that 'the victors write history,' they also give shape and meaning to words. This is a political act. When 'TANF recipients' become 'Welfare Queens' it is clearly with political intent. I teach to remind future frontline social workers that we link people to services, we don't save anybody. The people they serve are program participants, not beneficiaries. Afford them their dignity.\\" \\"I didn't know that going to jail was a bad thing just because every good person I know has been to jail. One of the stories about my mother was that they had all of the flatware taken away because they were banging on the cell bars making music and singing freedom songs.\\" She received her B.A. in Liberal Arts from Sarah Lawrence College in 1993, which was followed by a term of service in the United States Peace Corps, where she lived in both Western and Eastern Ukraine for two years. Afterward, she spent an additional two years working with a small NGO that supported the social normalization and increased mental and social development of Georgia's civil war orphans. She has also worked with out-of-school youth in Tanzania, with an agency providing Education for All via radio; and, managed an educational exchange program between a D.C.-based Early Childhood Development (ECD) Center and the membership (100+) of the ECD Collective, in Dar es Salaam. Dr. Guyot-Diangone earned her M.S.W. in 2005, while also attaining a diploma in Children, Youth, and Development from the Institute of Social Science in The Hague. Her Ph.D. was completed in 2012, from her alma mater, the Howard University School of Social Work, following a brief stint as a Visiting Research Fellow at Oxford University's Refugees Study Center.

The university offers teaching, research, and outreach activities, in diverse knowledge areas. Unimep was founded in 1964 as a set of individually accredited faculties, and was granted university status in 1975, becoming the first Methodist university in Latin America. The institution is sponsored by Instituto Educacional Piracicabano (IEP) and has four campuses, two of them located in Piracicaba, one in Santa B√°rbara d'Oeste and one in Lins. In a 2016 report by Instituto Nacional de Estudos e Pesquisas Educacionais An√≠sio Teixeira, a quasi-autonomous non- governmental organization under the Ministry of Education responsible for the quality assessment of higher education institutions in Brazil, Unimep obtained a general degree-course index (IGC, √çndice Geral de Cursos, in Portuguese) of 2.6478 (on a 0-5 scale) and was graded at level 3 (on a 1-5 scale) as a result of the assessment of 40 degree courses. In its 2016 assessment, Guia do Estudante, a Brazilian university guide, ranked Unimep as the second best private university of the interior of the state of Sao Paulo, and 14th on the global ranking of the state.  History  Missionary Martha Watts, founder of Col√©gio Piracicabano, from which Unimep was born. The history of Unimep dates back to 1881, when American missionary Martha Watts founded in Piracicaba the first Methodist school of Brazil, Col√©gio Piracicabano. In 1964, the school started to offer higher education courses in Economy, Administration and Accounting, referred as Integrated Faculties. With that expansion, in 1975, the Ministry of Education recognized Unimep as a university. In 1980, UNIMEP sponsored and hosted the 32nd congress of the National Union of Students, and elected Aldo Rebelo, linked to the Communist Party of Brazil, as its president. The then rector of UNIMEP interceded personally before the minister of justice of the Brazilian government, at the time under a military dictatorship, to allow the student mobilization. The congress gathered 4,000 students in Piracicaba and allowed for the restructuring of the National Union of Students.  Structure and academic offer  Unimep is structured into faculties, which in turn are structured into a number of degree courses: * Faculty of Engineering, Architecture and Urbanism (architecture and urbanism, civil engineering, food engineering, control and automation engineering, production engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, mechanical production, chemistry, industrial chemistry, mathematics, metallurgical processes, chemical processes); * Faculty of Health Sciences (biology, physical education, nursing, pharmacy, physiotherapy, veterinary medicine, nutrition); * Faculty of Odontology (odontology); * Faculty of Communication and Informatics (cinema and audiovisual, graphic design, photography, journalism, information systems, advertising, radio-TV- internet, computer networks); * Faculty of Humanities (history, philosophy, English, Portuguese, music, psychology, education, English translation and interpreting); * Faculty of Law (law); * Faculty of Management and Business (administration, economics, accounting, international business, international relations, gastronomy, foreign trade, marketing, industrial production management, human resource management, logistics). International relations Unimep has signed partnership agreements with universities in countries all around the world, such as Germany, Angola, Argentina, Belgium, Chile, Colombia, South Korea, Costa Rica, Cuba, Spain, United States, Finland, United Kingdom, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Mozambique, Paraguay, Portugal, Taiwan, Ukraine, and Uruguay.

After the German Campaign of 1813, Napoleon had to retreat back over the Rhine. Whereas the two armies of Bl√ºcher and Schwarzenberg invaded France and marched on Paris, a third allied army under Bernadotte entered the Low Countries. In January 1814 Napoleon appointed the old republican Lazare Carnot as governor of Antwerp. The 10,000 men garrison was composed of troops from I Corps, and the Young Guard, including a 500 strong battalion of Irish troops. After the French defeat at Hoogstraten, Carnot retreated to the fortified city and the Antwerp Citadel, which was then besieged by Prussian, Russian, and British forces. The French garrison under Lazare Carnot, aided by a French naval flotilla under Missiessy, then resisted the Allied siege and only surrendered the city after Louis XVIII of France signed an armistice upon Napoleon‚Äôs abdication.

Description Prominent black and white cross bars are present throughout the body. Black bars are paired and make the margins for the white bars. Parietal strip is present. Dorsal color bright red on nape and becomes fade to tail. There are 13 midbody scale rows, 174‚Äì175 ventral scales, and 129‚Äì139 subcaudal scales. Loreal scale is absent. The largest specimen measures in snout‚Äìvent length. Distribution Dendrelaphis effrenis was described based on a single specimen from Colombo, perhaps from rainforest patches near the city. At the time of description, the former D. sinharajensis was restricted to higher canopies of Sinharaja rain forest and its vicinity lowland wet zone. D. effrenis has now also been recorded in the Sabaragamuwa Province.

A cross-gabled ell extends to the left from the rear corner, and the present main entrance is set on the north side of the main block.

Its first permanent minister was granted land, but it was not until 1839 that the congregation agreed to build a parsonage for its fifth minister, Jacob Scales. Scales was locally controversial for his perceived weak position on the abolition of slavery, and was involved in disputes concerning the construction of the parsonage.

Historically, it emerged in the second half of the 19th century among the Amish, Mennonites of South German and Swiss ancestry as well as the Schwarzenau Brethren in the United States and Canada. The movement led to several Old Order divisions from mainstream Anabaptist groups between 1845 and 1901. All Old Order groups that emerged after 1901 divided from established Old Order groups or were formed by people coming from different Old Order groups.Donald B. Kraybill, Carl Bowman: On the Backroad to Heaven: Old Order Hutterites, Mennonites, Amish, and Brethren, Baltimore and London, 2001, pages 10-11. The highly conservative Old Colony Mennonites and the Hutterites were not directly connected to this movement.Donald B. Kraybill: Concise Encyclopedia of Amish, Brethren, Hutterites, and Mennonites, Baltimore 2010, page 158. Sandra L. Cronk writes about the Old Order Movement: Belief and practice Old Order groups do not have seminary trained pastors and never developed written sophisticated theology. Many practices among the Old Orders stem from the biblical principle of nonconformity to the world, according to and other Bible verses. The avoidance of technologies by Old Order communities is based not on a belief that the technology is in some way evil, but over a concern for the nature of their communities. Community is important to members of Old Order groups, and a technology or practice is rejected if it would adversely affect it. This means that the prohibitions are not usually absolute; a member who would not own a car may use a car or other modern transport if a pressing need arises. This basis also means that Old Orders see no contradiction in having electricity in their milking barn, since that is necessary to comply with regulations on milk cooling, but not in their house. Other aspects of Old Order life are concerned with plainness, which dictates their distinctive dress. Plain to Old Orders is the opposite of showy or ostentatious, and is considered a virtue. It is based on the belief that a person's true worth does not lie in their clothes or appearance. Nonresistance is a belief held by all Old Order groups. According to Donald Kraybill and Carl Bowman the following additional practices are common among the Old Orders:Donald B. Kraybill, Carl Bowman: On the Backroad to Heaven: Old Order Hutterites, Mennonites, Amish, and Brethren, Baltimore and London, 2001, page 201. *A capella singing *Believer's baptism *Excommunication *Fermented wine in communion *Foot washing *Holy Kiss *Kneeling for prayer *Multiple ministers lead in worship *Ordination of leaders by lot *Segregation by sex during worship *Self-examination before communion =Dress= All Old Order groups dress Plain and all their forms of dress share the same roots in the Pennsylvania Quaker dress style.Stephen Scott: Why Do They Dress That Way, Intercourse, PA 1986. =Buggies and cars= All Amish Old Order groups are horse and buggy groups, including the New Order Amish. Among the Old Order Mennonites, there are both horse and buggy and car driving groups. The same is true for the Old Orders among the Schwarzenau Brethren. The Old Order River Brethren are a car driving group, except a small subgroup of about half a dozen members, that still use horse and buggy transportation.Donald B. Kraybill: Concise Encyclopedia of Amish, Brethren, Hutterites and Mennonites, Baltimore, 2010, page 247.Stephen Scott: Plain Buggies: Amish, Mennonite, and Brethren Horse-drawn Transportation, Intercourse, PA 1981. =Language= All Amish Old Order groups speak a German dialect in every day life, either Pennsylvania German, or one of two Alemannic dialects (Swiss Amish). Among the Old Order Mennonites, all horse and buggy groups, except the Virginia groups, speak Pennsylvania German. The car driving groups of Old Order Mennonites shifted to English in the second half of the 20th century. The groups from which the Old Order Schwarzenau Brethren and Old Order River Brethren split, had already started shifting to English in the 19th century and mostly completed it in the first half of the 20th century. Demographics There are about 300,000 Old Order Amish, 60,000 to 80,000 Old Order Mennonites, about 7,000 Old Order Brethren and about 350 Old Order River Brethren. The Amish and Mennonite Old Orders have growth rates between 3 and 5 percent a year, in average about 3.7 percent. Old Order Schwarzenau and River Brethren groups in contrast have low growth rates and were even shrinking during the 20th century. All English speaking groups tend to grow much slower than their German speaking brothers.

It is located in Valle Olona (Varese), Italy, between the boundaries of Marnate, Olgiate Olona and Gorla Minore. Built by the Germans between July and September 1944, Marnate's Bunker was conquered by the Italian resistance movement on April 26, 1945 after a harsh fight against the German garrison. During the fight, five Germans were killed, while from Garibaldini only an Italian named Carlo Moltrasio from Fagnano Olona died, and two more were slightly injured. After the surrender of the Germans, the partisans inspected the bunker, finding it completely empty, except for a powerful bomb intended to destroy it. History Aldo Icardi with Mim Daddario In September 1944, Lieutenant Aldo Icardi, with the collaboration of the American Office of Strategic Services, parachuted behind the enemy lines of Mount Mottarone in command of Chrysler Mission with the specific task of capturing Benito Mussolini alive, and giving him to the Allied command. Icardi was in Busto Arsizio when Marnate's Bunker was built. He gathered information about it, and his reports are available in American archives, through which it has been possible to rebuild the history of the structure. Marnate's Bunker was strongly related to the German recovery of gold from the Macugnaga mines. General Karl Wolff, a German SS commandant in the Italian territory, ordered Captain Joseph Voettler, from the German SS garrison in Cernobbio, province of Como, to take direct control on the Italian-Swiss border and also to guarantee a safe way to export to Germany goods and machinery required by RuK (R√ºstung und Kriegsproduktion), a ministry of armament and war production of the Italian Social Republic in the north of Italy. Captain Voettler was also instructed by Wolff to find in Switzerland a license for the distillation of gold, making possible the transportation of the semi-finished materials directly over the border. Voettler decided to trade by train because trucks were usually intercepted by planes which checked the zone every day with two \\"Spitfires\\" named \\"Pippo\\" by the locals. Captain Voettler found an alternative method of sending these materials to Mendrisio, using the more irregular train times on the railway of Valmorea. File sent to Olgiate Olona's city hall from the firm who had the duty to build Marnate's bunker Captain Voettler found a solution with the German command of Olgiate Olona, located a few meters from Prospiano railway station from which the material could be easily sent, either to Milan or directly to Mendrisio. General Karl Wolff approved the request and ordered the construction of a bunker close to the German command of Olgiate Olona to protect the material. The construction was assigned to General Hans Leyers, responsible of the RuK, located in Como, at the specific request of Captain Joseph Voettler. For the construction of the bunker, General Hans Leyers asked for the collaboration of the German military specialized in defence building, at the time engaged close to the Brenner Pass area. A workforce was recruited and after two months of work, digging under Marnate and removing about 600 m¬≥ of material, the bunker was ready to receive the first shipments of gold. For the final transformation of the gold into blocks, Captain Voettler made an agreement with the Azienda Minerali Metallici Italiani firm, located in Milan. Supplied with the blocks, they should have been sent to Marnate, kept in the bunker, and then transported to Mendrisio in Switzerland. However, because of the daily bombing on Milan, sending the semi-finished gold directly from Marnate to Switzerland was considered. 250px For the transportation of materials from Macugnaga to Marnate, there was the sole possibility of using small trucks via a temporary bridge, since the railways from Sesto Calende, Oleggio and Turbigo were destroyed by the Allies, and Turbigo‚Äôs bridge was controlled by them. After the bunker was built, the Nazis had to face the loss of Macugnaga‚Äôs territory, taken by the Partisans. This made it impossible for Germans to transport the gold from there for some time, but shortly after, on 10 October 1944, they regained the control of the territory previously lost using their troops under the control of General Hans Leyers. As they checked the gold mines‚Äô status, 2,120 kg of semi-finished golden mud was found, which could be turned into 250 kg of pure gold, valued at around ‚Ç¨3,500,000. They also found two crates containing two gold blocks: one of 10.427 kg and the other one of 7.03 kg. Leyers ordered to bring all the crates to Marnate's Bunker. Mussolini became aware of the situation and intervened, sending a letter to General Karl Wolff, specifying that the gold was the property of the Government of the Italian Social Republic and should be returned. Mussolini blocked the whole operation and recovered all the material. General Karl Wolff was instructed to send the crates containing the semi-finished golden mud to Monza instead of Marnate. At Monza, SS Gen. Willy Tensfeld gave them to R.S.I. The crates containing the two golden ingots were found some years later, in 1946, in a bank in Garda, Veneto. Construction 220px The structure is placed on a 143 m¬≤ area with a 2.20 m height and 1.80 m width with four openings for access and an inside stair made of cement that links to the blockhouse situated on the bunker. It was originally assumed to have been constructed as an air-raid shelter; however, this conclusion was undermined by limited capacity (a shelter could have hosted about 400 people) and the amount of workforce used to build it (no more than 25 people). In addition, the 700 kg bomb found inside the bunker and the blockhouse on its surface, made it impossible to endorse the hypothesis that it was built for the purpose of protecting people. Subsequently, reports from Lieutenant Aldo Icardi led to the conclusion that the main propose of Marnate¬¥s Bunker was the storage of gold material. Post-war events During the 1970s a few veterans returned to the bunker to attempt to recover part of the treasure, but the attempt was terminated following a car accident. In May 1991, Marnate¬¥s Bunker was renovated by the Associazione Nazionale Partigiani d'Italia (ANPI). At that time only one of the four entries was clear and unobstructed. During this renovation, vegetation and debris were removed from another two entries, and a 100 meter long passageway was found. Subsequently, a sketch map was created of the bunker. As of 2016, the two remaining entries remain closed. Renovation 300px In March 2015, Marnate's Bunker opened to the public in collaboration with Mario Colombo, president of the ANPI in Gorla. During the inauguration, a dedication to Carlo Moltrasio and to all the victims of the war was made, with the participation of Ester De Tomasi, ANPI province president, Antonio Pizzinato, national leader, the municipality administrations in Medio Olona, and Gunnar Vincenzi, province president. The main purpose is to use the bunker as a museum to maintain alive the memory of the war, its victims and to render homage to the courageousness of all the partisans of Valle Olona, who in April 1945 attacked the bunker and took it from the Nazis. In 2016, the bunker remains closed to the public due to the risk of structural instability. In popular culture In 2012 the bunker was used as a filming location for a short horror film called \\"Ariadne's Thread\\", directed by Michele Puricelli Abraham, well known as Michele Abraham. The story is about two teenagers who meet in a pub, in Valle Olona. They decide to go to Marnate's Bunker, abandoned since World War II. The excursion inside the bunker turns into a dangerous trap, from which they do not return. This short horror film alludes to the renowned myth of Theseus and Knossos Labyrinth, in which people could easily lose themselves and be eaten by The Minotaur, a monstrous Greek mythological creature. The Bunker is used by the director as a movie set to create mystery with dark and narrow spaces. The association La Capra a Tempo realized a mural on the external wall of the bunker, showing the memorable edition of the first page of June 11, 1946 on the newspaper Corriere della Sera.

The name changed to Stoford and then to Stafford. One branch married into the family of Wollocombe, of Wollocombe. But the name of Stowford or Stafford was not the most ancient designation of the family, which was Kelloway, and bore as its arms four pears. The last Stafford turned from pears to apples, to which he devoted his attention and became a connoisseur not in apples only, but in the qualities of cyder as already intimated. To a branch of this family belonged Sir John Stowford, Lord Chief Baron in the reign of Edward III\\".

Their son was John Stafford of Dowland, who married Juliana Osborne, daughter and co-heiress of Hugh Osborne of Iddesleigh.Vivian, p.510, pedigree of Kelloway of Stowford Hence Iddesleigh came to the Stafford family and then to the Northcore family. Much of this descent is laid out in large Victorian stained glass windows in Iddesleigh Church, erected by the Northcote Earls of Iddesleigh.

The estate of Pynes thus passed into the Northcote family. Following his marriage Northcote abandoned the family seat of Hayne, which sank to the status of a farmhouse,Lauder, p.111 and moved to the Stafford seat of Pynes House. In the 1790s the house was occupied by Sir Stafford Henry Northcote, 7th Baronet. The building was enlarged in 1851 by the statesman Sir Stafford Northcote, 8th Baronet, who in 1885 was created by Queen Victoria 1st Earl of Iddesleigh, which manor had been inherited from the Stafford family with Pynes. In 1852 he added a ceremonial entrance hall, to the design of Ambrose Poynter, for a visit by Queen Victoria. Walter Stafford Northcote, 2nd Earl of Iddesleigh claimed that Pynes House was the inspiration for Barton Park, which features in Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility.See, for instance, The Earl of Iddesleigh sold Pynes in 1998.

He has written books in the fiction genres of historical novels and the Romance novel. His most important books are Kesselring (2009), Vip & Stars (1983), Dante Alighieri e la battaglia di Montecatini (2015), Le stragi naziste sotto la linea gotica 1944: Sant'Anna di Stazzema, Padule di Fucecchio, Marzabotto (2004). Biography Montecatini; where Ferretti lived most of his life, and where he currently lives with his wife. Vasco Ferretti was born in Buggiano, Toscana (August 25, 1935). He was born in to a farming family, and obtained his master's degree in 1953, after studying for two years at the Catering College of Montecatini. He then worked as a hotel doorman in Forte dei Marmi. In 1955‚Äì1956 he attended the annual course for trade union leaders of the Trade Union CISL (Centro Studi di San Domenico di Fiesole), and emerged with a five-year assignment in Rome as the National Secretary of Tourism Workers in the same CISL. He returned to Montecatini because of his family's economic problems and then studied to obtain a degree in philosophy and science of education in 1970 at the University of Urbino, where he subsequently taught for two years. His victory at the Ministerial Competition allowed him to teach philosophy and history at the Institute of Pescia and Montecatini, until his retirement from teaching in 1992. In 1975 he was listed in the Register of Journalists working in Tuscany. For the past decades he has dedicated himself to historical research by publishing with Mursia (Milan) the following works: \\"Kesselring\\" (biography); \\"Nazi massacres of Marzabotto, Stazzema and marshes of Fucecchio.\\"; \\"1944, a Red Blood Summer\\", set in Tuscany under the German occupation during World War II. Ferretti also works with other publishers: \\"Lager and Gulag\\" with Amazon (ebook on Kindle). Influences Ferretti's works are highly influenced by traces of his philosophical and classical formation. In passages of his books there are multiple references to Franz Kafka in the syntax and in the paragraph structure. His works are influenced by his association with Hermeticism and by his relationship with writers such as Giuseppe Ungaretti, Salvatore Quasimodo, Eugenio Montale and Dante Alighieri, who deeply influenced him and his literature. Hermeticism is a tradition which follows a set of philosophical and religious beliefs. Works =Kesselring (2009)= Kesselring (Edizioni Mursia, Milano, 2009) is a biography of Albert Kesselring, a German Luftwaffe general, during World War II. The general was born on November 30, 1885, in Marktsteft (German empire) and died in a sanatorium in Bad Nauheim in West Germany, on 16 July 1960 at the age of 74, following a heart attack.von Lingen, Soldat bis zum letzten Tag? Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, p. 220 He was one of the most skillful and highly decorated commanders of Nazi Germany. The biography focuses on the general's military feats, his imprisonment and his participation to the Nuremberg trials(1946) as a witness, and to the trials in Venice (1947) as an accused. The structure of the biography is a historical- judiciary thriller, which is one of the characteristics that made this novel one of Vasco Ferretti's most relevant works.http://www.mursia.com/index.php/it/storia/kesselring-detail Author Ovidio Dallera in a review of Kesselring describes General Kesselring as a character who earned his notoriety unlike many historical characters who have obtained an undeserved 'fame'. Vasco Ferretti, has been the first historical researcher that has brought the acts of the process against Albert Kesselring in Italy, from the War Office in Kew (London), from which he also drew the book Vernichten.http://www.mursia.com/index.php/it/storia/storia- contemporanea/seconda-guerra-mondiale/nazismo/kesselring-detail Kesselring by Vasco Ferretti isn't the only book regarding the general, since other writings about him could also be found, for example: Kesselring's own biography written by himself during his combat years, Albert Kesselring written by P. Paolo Battistelli and Kesselring: the making of the Luftwaffe written by Kenneth Macksey. =Dante Alighieri e la battaglia di Montecatini (2015)= Dante Alighieri e la battaglia di Montecatini (EDIFIR, 2015) is a historical novel about the Battle of Montecatini, on August 29, 1325 in the Province of Pistoia. The battle was fought in the Val di Nievole by the Republic of Pisa, and the forces of both the Kingdom of Naples and the Republic of Florence. The Guelphs and the Capetian House of Anjou hoped the battle represented the showdown for the Ghibellines of Pisa and of Lucca, led by Uguccione della Faggiuola and Castruccio Castracani, but it turned out to be a tragic defeat to the detriment of Florence instead. Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, in his biography of Castruccio Castracani, wrote that the battle only caused thousands of deaths. Due to the ransom of many prisoners, Florence suffered an economic collapse and this situation made complex the conditions of Dante Alighieri, who was returning after thirteen years of exile. Dante himself, as well as all his biographers, desired to go back to Florence to spend the rest of his life. It unfortunately was a life expectancy never assuaged. =Vernichten (1988)= Vernichten (in German = 'annihilate') refers to the order given to the soldiers of the Wehrmacht for the massacre of the Marsh of Fucecchio in August 23‚Äì24, 1944. It was run by General Peter Eduard Crasemann and caused 174 victims (men, women and children).http://www.vascoferretti.it/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=39&catid;=13&Itemid;=243 The massacre took place in the area between Pistoia and Florence that is called Marsh of Fucecchio. The reasons for the massacre are unclear, but could be related to false intelligence which pointed out the presence of gangs of partisans in the Marsh of Fucecchio. =Le stragi naziste sotto la linea gotica. 1944: Sant'Anna di Stazzema, Padule di Fucecchio, Marzabotto= Max Simon Le stragi naziste sotto la linea gotica. 1944: Sant'Anna di Stazzema, Padule di Fucecchio, Marzabotto is an enquire book about the massacres committed by the 16.

Per il tribunale spezzino fu puro terrorismo committed by the nazi in order to intimidate and scare the population of Marzabotto, Sant'Anna di Stazzema and Padule di Fucecchio. The author provides a precise chronicle of the massacres and how they happened. The book also explores the background of those communities before the tragedy and the psychological impact these slaughters had on the population and on the partisan resistance. Due to its relevant historical content for the Italian culture, the book was inserted into the historical series of the Italian editor Mursia =Processo a Moravia (1994)= In a late evening of September 1974 (16 years before his death), Alberto Moravia is the great defendant in a process that takes place in one of the \\"liberty\\" rooms of the Tamerici baths in Montecatini. The accuser is Aldo Rossi, the defender of Moravia is Geno Pampaloni, a well known Italian book reviewer. It was more a great opportunity for Moravia to express himself, his ideas and his motives to write rather than the focus on the process itself. He explained so much that it could have been possible to draft his autobiography. He was brought to the process because of his lack of proper interest in the country's affairs. He confesses his thoughts in front of an audience that previously had witnessed at the process of Pier Paolo Pasolini and accept his reasons as well as it did with Moravia's in this trial fiction. Moravia claims he is a disciple of F√´dor Dostoevskij (Fyodor Dostoyevsky): indeed traces of the Russian writer can be recognized in his literature. Alberto Moravia outlines his strong tendency to tell stories and his great curiosity as to illustrate his disengaged literature. Geno Pampaloni deems him to be the most illustrious journalist in Italy; nowadays he is still remembered as one of the greatest journalist. =Vips e Stars, cento personaggi alle terme di Montecatini (1983)= Vips and stars is a unique story of characters that recalls the Belle √âpoque period and the roaring '60s. Its main characters are divas, geniuses, kings, lords, queens, maraharaja, writers, politicians, musicians, movie producers, actors and actresses.

Built in 1928, it is a Parker through truss, one of only two of this type on the Winooski River and an increasingly rare bridge type in the state. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006 as Bridge 31. Description and history The Winooski Street Bridge is located in southern Waterbury and northern Duxbury, where the west-flowing Winooski River forms the border between the two communities. It is located a short way south of downtown Waterbury and west of the rural center of Duxbury, and is one of two bridges joining the two communities (the other carries United States Route 2 further to the east). Winooski Street runs south from downtown Waterbury to the bridge, at whose southern end River Street in Duxbury parallels the river. The bridge is a single-span Parker through truss, long, set on concrete abutments which are themselves set partially on remnants of older stone abutments. It has a width of , and has a sidewalk cantilevered onto the downstream (western) side. The bridge deck is concrete laid on steel stringers and floor beams. with The bridge was built in 1928 after Vermont's devastating 1927 floods, which destroyed more than 1,200 bridges. The state embarked on a massive construction program, in which largely standardized designs and construction methods were used to build replacement bridges. This bridge was designed by H.L. Shoemaker, and its truss elements were fabricated by the Bethlehem Steel Company. Its abutments were rebuilt in the 1970s, and the bridge itself underwent rehabilitation in the 2000s. The first bridge on the site was probably a covered bridge, built c. 1890. By 1924, it had been replaced by a steel truss bridge, which was washed away by the 1927 flood.

Kostianoy, The Black Sea Encyclopedia, Springer Publishing, 2014, p. 206 made up of naturally shaped rocks on the Southern Demerdzhi Mountain, located near Alushta city. The stone shapes resemble statues of humans, animals, legendary creatures from fairy tales, pyramids and various mystery objects. The characteristics and forms of the rocks are also subject to the time of day, lighting and atmospheric conditions, such as the characteristic thick fog of the region. It is a unique and natural monument of national significance. Demerdzhi is the only place in the Crimea to observe the phenomenon of \\"Brokkensky ghost\\" (Brocken spectre). History South- Demerdzhi side \\"Stone figures\\", which were formed by the weathering of rocks on the southwest slope of Demerdzhi Mountain, are called The Valley of Ghosts. It has been affected by several rock falls, notably in April 1894 and August 1966. The mountain Demerdzhi gets its mystery from the haze which changes its colors. In the Middle Ages, the mountain had the name 'Funa', which means \\"fuming\\", because of frequent fog. The Valley of Ghosts was located on the slopes of Demerdzhi Castle and its remains have survived until now. There is a road which leads to the castle near the Valley of Ghosts . Near the village of Funa, there are the ruins of Demerdzhi Castle, dating back to 13th - 15th centuries. The castle was an outpost of the principality Theodore, where a small garrison prevented the penetration of the Genoese into Tavria. There was also a towered two-story church where a family vault is located. Geologists hypothesize that the Valley of Ghosts became unwrinkled due to centuries of influence of the sea. The sea levels rose, and the entire Crimean Peninsula turned into many small islands. Over thousands of years passed, the sea was gradually going down, washing the lowlands of high rocks and hard stones turning into a crumbly sand of the sea, gradually grinding boulders and giving them the most intricate shapes. Geology The Valley of Ghosts; the foot of mountain Demerdzhi Demerdzhi mountain covers an area of 13.8 square kilometers. From West to East it is 5.5 kilometers, and 3.5 kilometers from North to South. Geographers divide the area into two parts - North and South Demerdzhi. The northern part is much larger in size, and slightly higher. The highest point is 1,359 meters above sea level. The highest point of the southern part is 1,239 meters above sea level. Demerdzhi Mountain has developed the so-called conglomerates-small fragments of various rocks, boulders, pebbles of different sizes cemented sand and clay and, as a result of the action of natural forces the mysterious stone figures that form the Valley of Ghosts have emerged. Southern Demerdzhi, where the Valley of Ghosts is located, is composed of conglomerates, consisting of coarse rocks, pebbles and boulders with a solidified sand-clay mass between them. These were formed in the coastal sea in the Late Jurassic period. The conglomerates exhibit cracks of different types. These conglomerates are geologically unusual for three reasons. Firstly, the Valley of Rocks conglomerates include quartzite and pink granite, in addition to the typical Crimea sandstone, compacted clay, limestone, milky white quartz and brown siderite concretions. Secondly, the granite, dated to 650 - 950 million years old, is significantly older than the surrounding clay and sandstone of the Crimean mountains, dated to 160 - 200 million years. Thirdly, the Demerdzhi conglomerates are unusually large, with sizes of around 1,750 meters. These conglomerates have been intricately formed by natural weathering. Various figures, dozens of meters high, can be found here. Some of them have been likened in form to the basalt idols of Easter Island. At the top of the mountain, a rare atmospheric phenomenon known as \\"Brokkensky ghost\\" can be seen during sunrise. To observe the \\"ghost\\" appearance, several conditions must be met: Chatyr-Dag must be shrouded in mist and the area over the sea and Demerdzhi must be clear, transparent and completely permeable to sunlight. During sunrise, it is possible to see shadows projected on the background of Chatyr-Dag, shrouded in mist, surrounded by a circular rainbow halo. Climate The Valley of Ghosts has a typical Crimean climate of hot summers and mild winters. The average winter temperature, especially in the coldest month of January, is about . In summer, the warmest month is July with a temperature of . The variation in annual temperature is around . The dry climate means that the water temperature remains stable between . October is the driest month with an average precipitation is 40mm. Precipitation is the greatest in December, with an average is 81mm. Wildlife =Flora= Oudemansiella mucida on the mount Demerdzhi The valley is symbolised by walnut and cherry trees, lawn, rocks, springs (already partially capped), creeks and small deep lakes. Meadows occur, where fruit trees grow. These are so-called 'chairies', a local name for woodland gardens. These were created by the local population, and are now being replaced by farms with more prolific gardens. There is a relic forest, flora of which includes 420 species, including singular species such as yew, lyadvenets Crimea, sainfoin yaylinsky, pyracantha, and others. =Fauna= Two horses photographed on the mount Demerdzhi Typical fauna comprehends: *wild pigeons, which feed on the seeds of weeds and fallen fruits *partridge or chukar, which are safeguarded by law and hunting of them is forbidden *rock thrush *northern wheatear *woodpecker Toponymy The name of the old village of Funa (\\"smoky\\" in Greek), located under the mountain near a road to Aluston (current Alushta) may have its origins in the occupant's trade in blacksmithing. At the end of the 18th century, when Christians were forced out of Crimea by the decree of Catherine II, the village became occupied by Tatars from the southern coast. The village was rechristened ‚ÄúDemerdzhi‚Äù (\\"smith\\" in the Tatar language). Today, the village has the name Luchistoe. Russian history books point out that the village was reallocated to a more secure place based on the advice of the geologist Nikolai A. Golovkinsky after the disaster in 1894 (rockfalls occurred regularly since 1615 to 1989). However, authors of the book \\"Aluston and Funa\\", K. Kogonashvili and O. Makhneva, pictured this episode in a different way. They wrote that the village was relocated due to a local landlord magnifying the risk so that he could spread and expand their garden at the site of the old village. Tourism The Valley of Ghosts can be reached via the village Luchistoe, taking the trolleybuses ‚Ññ51 or ‚Ññ52 on the Simferopol-Alushta-Yalta road. From Luchistoe, it takes 30 minutes walking along paved road to the valley, passing a horse riding club called \\"Zolotaya Podkova\\" (\\"Golden Horseshoe\\", Russian: \\"–ó–æ–ª–æ—Ç–∞—è –ø–æ–¥–∫–æ–≤–∞\\"). The village of Luchistoe can be also reached from Alushta by bus ‚Ññ107 from the town bus station. If traveling by car from the city of Alushta, Luchistoe can be found in 4 kilometers. Movies =Hearts of Three = The Valley of Ghosts is a filming location for some scenes in the film \\"Hearts of Three\\" (Russian:\\"–°–µ—Ä–¥—Ü–∞ —Ç—Ä–µ—Ö\\", ). This film was based on the novel Hearts of Three. In one scene, company Solano spent the night in the old ruins of castle Funa at Southern Demerdzhi when they were running away from the police. The heroes came across the Indian Maya Rudolph there. Chia's eyes flashed in the middle of the Valley of Ghosts. In the film, it was called \\"The valley of lost souls\\". = Kidnapping, Caucasian Style = The Soviet film Kidnapping, Caucasian Style () used areas in the Caucasus and in Crimea. The song of N. Varley was performed on one of the rocks belonging to the Valley of Ghosts, which is about two meters tall. Also, here grew \\"The Nikulin nut\\", with whom the actor fell during the filming. The tree branch cracked somewhere other than where the initial incision was made, and the actor broke his arm. Therefore, the shooting had to be put off until a later time. The primary filming locations are the city center of Alushta, and The Valley of Ghosts. Additionally, in Kidnapping, Caucasian Style, there are scenes shot in Simferopol (a mental hospital), on the top of Ai-Petri and the Caucasus, and in the Adler Microdistrict of Sochi on the Mzymta River. Legends Some rocks which are shaped like ghosts. The legend of the origin of The Valley of Ghosts has different names, such as: \\"The Smith from Mountain Demerdzhi\\", \\"Mountain-smith\\", \\"About the mountain Demerdzhi\\". There are several variations to the story, which however contains the common elements. =The Smith from Mountain Demerdzhi= This legend portrays the story of how Crimean conquerors - nomads - came to the land. The residents named the mountain \\"Funa\\" because post-fire steam and lights regularly came out from the top of the mountain. The blacksmith who delegated as the nomad by conquerors set up a huge forge on the mountain which became a workplace to create weapons and start using it to enslave the locals. Strongest men in the village were all taken into the forge. When people from the village worked to exhaustion and even some died, they went to the blacksmith to ask him to leave the mountain. The blacksmith responded by killing them all by fire. A girl called Maria decided to go to the blacksmith alone again. She quietly snuck into the smithy one night and asked the Blacksmith to leave the mountain. The blacksmith refused and commanded Maria to stay with him. In response, Maria pushed him strongly straight to the furnace. The blacksmith grabbed a dagger and killed the girl. The mountain itself could not tolerate this anymore, so it swallowed blacksmith together with his men (the nomads) and carried people from the valley to their original homes by wind. When the flames were extinguished and the dust settled, an extraordinary scene was there. Towering stone statues of unknown monsters - they were ugly similarities of a blacksmith and his henchmen - were on the mountain. On the highest point of the mountain, there was a rock, looked like the girl Maria - the latest victim of a brutal blacksmith. From that time Funa was extinguished, no fire is ever seen over the top. People who knew the story gave the mountain a new name - Demerdzhi, which means \\"smith\\". =Legend of Demerdzhi Mountain= The Valley of Ghosts Many years ago, an unknown man who knew the devil and named blacksmith settled on the top of the mountain Demerdzhi. Once, the mountain shook and houses within the villages were then destroyed. Villagers gathered together to discuss because the mountain was at peace before the strange man came. They decided to send the most courageous and intelligent ones up the mountain, requesting the stranger to leave, but he refused. After a while, a beautiful Greek woman came to the mountain and sat down to rest near a spring. In the village, where she was from, the fountains stopped murmuring, and people lost their water. People then realized who was the cult of the disaster and went to demand the return of beauty. The news was spread that the stranger was the great sinner. People believed that the mountain trembled because it does not want to carry him anymore. Terrified inhabitants of the valley gathered in the ancient temple and begged God to save them from the evil alien but nothings happened for long days. When the holidays horban-Adha come, believers prayed for three days and nights. The flame was raised on Demerdzhi, buzzes and groanings were all around, great stones fell down from the mountain. As everything came to peace, people did not see the terrible alien anymore. But strangely, they found stone figures of animals, form of people and unseen monsters on the mountainside facing the Babuganu (a part Gurzufskaya plateau). Later, people learned that this was done to make sure that people should never forget the terrible sinner who was responsible of that tragedy.

Existential in nature, the plot centers around the eponymous Don Diego de Zama, a minor official of the colonial Spanish Empire stationed in remote Paraguay during the late 18th century and his attempts to receive a long-awaited promotion and transfer to Buenos Aires in the face of personal and professional stagnation. Di Benedetto drew heavily from Russian writer Fyodor Dostoevsky. These existential themes of inward and outward stasis because of circumstance drive the novel's narrative as being constantly in motion yet never changing. Together with two of his other novels, El silenciero (1964) and Los suicidas (1969), Zama has been published as part of Benedetto's informal La trilog√≠a de la espera (The Trilogy of Expectation). The novel is considered by various critics to be a major work of Argentine literature.  Plot summary  Don Diego de Zama is a servant to the Spanish crown in remote Paraguay. Separated from his wife and children, he continuously schemes for professional advancement as he struggles with his mental and emotional state as isolation, bureaucratic setbacks, and self-destructive choices begin to compound themselves in his life. The novel is divided chronologically into three sections: 1790, 1794, and 1799, which focus on, respectively, Zama's sexual, financial, and existential conflicts.  Reception  Obscure on its original release and unknown to English readers before its translation in 2016, Zama has since been considered by various critics to be a major work of Argentine literature. Roberto Bola√±o used Antonio di Benedetto and Zama as the basis of his short story \\"Sensini\\" from the collection Last Evenings on Earth, about fictional writer Luis Antonio Sensini and his novel Ugarte, likewise about an 18th-century colonial bureaucrat, described as having been written with \\"neurosurgical precision.\\" The 2016 translation in English was lauded in The New Yorker by novelist Benjamin Kunkel as \\"a neglected South American masterpiece\\" (\\"The belated arrival of Zama in the United States raises an admittedly hyperbolic question: Can it be that the Great American Novel was written by an Argentinean? It‚Äôs hard, anyway, to think of a superior novel about the bloody life of the frontier.\\"), and by Nobel Prize in Literature laureate J. M. Coetzee in The New York Review of Books: \\"Zama remains the most attractive of Di Benedetto‚Äôs books, if only because of the crazy energy of Zama himself, which is vividly conveyed in Esther Allen‚Äôs excellent translation.\\" Esther Allen's translation into English won the 2017 National Translation Award (USA).  Adaptation  In 2017 Zama was adapted into a feature film by Argentine director Lucrecia Martel.

Two of them suffered stab wounds, while the third was physically assaulted but otherwise uninjured. The suspected assailant, a Belgian citizen named Hicham Diop, was apprehended and charged with attempted terrorism-related murder and participating in a terrorist group. He soon told police that his brother had also been involved, and the brother, Aboubaker Diop, was also arrested. Background Prior to the stabbing, Schaerbeek and the nearby neighborhood of Molenbeek had already become known as \\"a hotbed of jihadism\\" in Brussels. It was the neighborhood where the perpetrators of the March 2016 Brussels bombings and some of the perpetrators of the November 2015 Paris attacks were based. Schaerbeek was the home of the taxi driver who drove the suspects to Brussels Airport. They raided the home and found a nail bomb, of acetone peroxide, hydrogen peroxide, and an ISIL flag. Inside a waste container near the house they also found a computer belonging to Ibrahim El Bakraoui who is believed to have carried out suicide bombings during the attacks along with his brother. The stabbing came nearly two months after a similar stabbing attack in Charleroi, in which an Algerian citizen stabbed two police officers; and nearly one month after another similar attack in nearby Molenbeek, in which a man of North African origin slightly injured two police officers. At the time of the stabbing, Brussels was on a high terror alert. ISIS has used social media to inspire sympathizers in Western countries to target police and soldiers for attack on the grounds that they represent the state. The attack was one of a series of attacks on Belgian police officers in 2016, including the stabbing of two officers on 7 September in Molenbeek and the 6 August 2016 stabbing of Charleroi police officers. Christopher Dickey describes this attack as part of a pattern of jihadist attacks in which there have been, \\"many small incidents and thwarted ones, then suddenly one or two high- casualty attacks\\" in Europe since 2014. The attack occurred as a summit of world leaders, including American Secretary of State John Kerry, met in Brussels to discuss Afghanistan. Attack The attack reportedly occurred during an identity check on Boulevard Lambermont, a busy main road in Schaerbeek.Milan Schreuer, \\"2 Brussels Police Officers Are Stabbed in ‚ÄòPotential Terrorist Attack‚Äô,\\" 5 October 2016, The New York Times, . A man, armed with a machete, lunged for two police officers; one was stabbed in the stomach and the other in the neck, but neither was seriously injured. Afterwards, the attacker fled the scene, but encountered a third officer nearby and got into a violent struggle, which resulted in Diop, a former professional boxer, slugging the officer and giving him a broken nose. The officer then shot and wounded the attacker with a single shot to the leg. According to an eyewitness, the attacker shouted something in Arabic after being shot. Suspect The suspect, Hicham Diop (43), was at first identified only as Hicham D. by police and media. According to Belgian media, he was a 43-year-old Belgium Army veteran and former boxer who was discharged in 2009 and was previously known to police and to security services for his contacts with extremist Islamists. He was also believed to have links to jihadists who traveled to Syria. A married man with young children, Diop once stood for a seat in a regional parliament, but lost the election. His home was searched by Belgian police, which recovered no weapons. A spokesman for the federal prosecutor said there was \\"reason to believe that [the stabbing] is terror- related\\", but did not initially elaborate. Hicham D. was charged with attempted terrorism-related attempted murder and participating in a terrorist group. His 46-year-old brother, Aboubaker Diop, was also arrested and charged with participating in a terrorist group. In 2011, Aboubaker and Hicham were involved in an incident involving the official police vehicle of a security officer. Also in 2015, the brothers were arrested for fighting in an incident involving shots fires at a Kinepolis security guard. The defense asserted that the incident was a family quarrel relating to events that occurred years ago in Senegal. Hicham Diop stood for election on the list of an Islamist party. The brothers are part of a family that migrated to Belgium from Senegal. Hicham was a kickboxer. Legal proceedings =Hicham Diop= Hicham Diop has been charged with attempted murder in a terrorist context, deliberate intentional assault, violations of arms legislation and armed rebellion. According to Belgian police, Hicham made terrorism related statements as he was being interrogated. He was known to police for having been in contact with Islamic extremists. An additional set of charges was filed in June 2017 for threatening two officers with death as they transported him to the police station following his arrest for assault in October 2016. In September 2017, a federal prosecutor asked that Diop be sentenced to 15 years' prison.https://www.rtbf.be/info/societe/detail_agression-au-couteau-contre- des-policiers-15-ans-requis-contre-hicham-diop?id=9702766 =Aboubaker Diop= Aboubaker Diop, born in 1970, a Belgian national has been charged with \\"participation in the activities of a terrorist group.\\" Reactions Belgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon tweeted a statement after the attack, expressing his support for police officers in Schaerbeek. In a speech in February 2017, Donald Trump stated that the media was not reporting on terrorist attacks. Later that day, the administration included this stabbing attack in a list of 78 attacks which the admin said were \\"under-reported\\". It was not clear what \\"under-reported\\" meant, or what criteria were used to compile the list. News organizations stated that they had indeed covered most of the incidents in the list, some of them extensively. Politifact rated Donald Trump's claim as false.

QiuQiu at pagat.com. Retrieved 12 June 2019. It may also be referred to as '99 domino poker'. It is played using a set of (28) double-six dominoes, which in Indonesia typically take the form of small cards, which are discarded after a few games as they show signs of wear. Players are typically required to pay a fixed ante into a pot, and are then dealt three domino cards. After evaluating their cards each player in turn may either bet (if there is no previous bettor), call (if there is a previous bettor), raise (if there is a previous bettor), or fold. If there was only one bettor in the first round, the game ends and the bettor takes the pot without showing his cards. Otherwise all players who did not fold are dealt a fourth card, following which there is a second and final round of betting. Both the first and second rounds of betting are typically subject to limits, with a higher limit for the second round. After the final round of betting, then each player who did not fold must in turn expose his cards and declare his hand. The player with the highest hand takes the pot. Cards are formed into pairs where the pips on each pair are summed, and only the last unit's digit is considered (a pip total of 23 becomes 3, 19 becomes 9). The highest pair possible is therefore a 9 (or 'kiu'). Pairs are compared such that the higher pair is compared first, and then the second pair. There are three special hands ranking above a pair of nines, from highest: # High (total pips on four dominoes equal to or above 38 - house rules may vary this number) # Low (total pips on four dominoes equal to or below 9 - house rules may vary below this number) # 4 doubles (four double dominoes) A fourth special hand ranks below qiu-qiu, but above all other non-special hands: * Straight (four dominoes whose pips have consecutive pip totals, e.g., 6-1 (7), 5-3 (8), 5-4 (9), 6-4 (10); note this hand could also be declared as (the lower ranking) kiu-5) An exception to the rule of forming hands into pairs is the case of three doubles; this is also considered a 'kiu', hence the fourth card is considered alone. If two players both have a straight, or two pairs with the same value, then the higher hand is the one with the higher double, or if neither player has a double, the highest straight. Players may employ both mathematics and bluffing tactics in determining when to bet or fold. For example, a player who is dealt three doubles after the first round already has a 'kiu', at a minimum and has a chance to draw fourth double, or a qiu-qiu, and should never fold. On the other hand, a player holding 5-4 (9), 3-2 (5) and 4-1 (5), can at best improve to qiu-four (with either 3-1, 2-2, or 4-0), which if many players are playing, is likely to be a losing hand, so he can do no better than hope to steal the pot, if action is folded to him.

Minnesota was won by the Democratic candidate, incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt won the state over New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey by a margin of 62,448 votes, or 5.55%. Nationally, Roosevelt was re-elected to an unprecedented fourth term as president, with 432 electoral votes and a comfortable 7.5% lead over Dewey in the popular vote. However, Roosevelt would not serve the entirety of his fourth term, as he died within a half-year after winning his final election. Roosevelt was the only president of the United States who was elected to more than two quadrennial terms. The 22nd Amendment, ratified on February 27, 1951, ensures that Roosevelt will continue to hold this record indefinitely, as the said amendment prohibits any person from serving more than two and a half terms as president.

This album continues in the direction of the band's lighter sound, and is the biggest departure from the band's extreme metal roots, and contains prominent indie rock influences. Critical reception Andy Kelly of Jesus Freak Hideout wrote \\"Overall, Songs for the Living is a very solid release that takes Embodyment in incredible new directions, including great vocals and melodies that will be stuck in your head for weeks to come.\\", while Kevin Gordon of AllMusic wrote \\"...Embodyment's Songs for The Living makes a convincing pitch for mainstream success. Guitarist Andrew Godwin's six-string work dominates the material, laying the groundwork for Sean Corbray's soaring vocals. The band's Christian leanings are only hinted at in these songs; the obtuse lyrics instead exploring the many facets of romance and human relationships. \\"Reaching Out\\" sounds a little like R.E.M., even as it reasserts a grab at faith, while \\"She's There\\" revisits the memory of a lost love with Wall-of-Sound instrumentation and powerful vocals. A red-hot riff and recurring rhythm sends \\"Segue Station\\" into the stratosphere, glimpses of lyrics passing by underneath a shimmering melody and sonic overkill. Altogether radio-friendly and ready for the major leagues, Embodyment discarded a large part of its past in favor of a brighter future with the slickly-produced, chart-rock of Songs for The Living. Although the band has done little to distinguish itself from, say, Creed and its many doppelgangers, ten years down the road finds Embodyment still reaching for the stars, adding various disparate elements to their sound, and seeing what works.\\" Track listing Credits ;Embodyment * Sean Corbray - Vocals * Andrew Godwin - Guitar * Derrick \\"Stone\\" Wadsworth - Guitar * Jason Lindquist - Bass * Mark Garza - Drums ;Production * Barry Poynter - Recording * Edward Phillips - Executive Producer * Michael Lewis - Executive Producer * Roger E.

Prior to being appointed President of Fordham University, he graduated from St. Francis Xavier College (later to become Xavier High School) in 1887, after which he went on to study at Boston College and then teach theology at Woodstock College for nineteen years. He was fifty-seven years old when he came to Fordham. Duane oversaw several noteworthy events in Fordham University's development, including the completion of the Rose Hill campus gymnasium, which, having been undertaken in 1923, was dedicated in 1925. Shortly after the dedication of Rose Hill Gymnasium, work was begun on a new library, the first of five buildings that Duane would see built. This significant expansion of the university's facilities occurred during a period of notable growth within the infrastructure of the American Catholic Church; Duane's emphasis on the building, expansion and renovation of university facilities can be seen to reflect this trend within the church during this time period. Duane Library, located on the university's Rose Hill campus and later repurposed into an administrative building, was dedicated in Duane's honor after the completion of his service to the university in 1930. In addition to growing the university's infrastructure, the university's Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program was established in 1926.

Built in the 1790s, it is one of the highest-style Federal period houses in Chittenden County, with a distinctive brickwork exterior and numerous unusual interior features. It was built by Thomas Chittenden for his son Martin, both of whom served as Governor of Vermont. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description and history The Martin Chittenden House stands in a rural area of southwestern Jericho, on the west side of River Road (VT 117) overlooking the Winooski River. It is a 2-1/2 story brick building, five bays wide and three deep, with a side gable roof and end chimneys. The brick of the front is laid in Flemish bond, while the sides are laid in Flemish cross bond, giving a diamond cross pattern to those surfaces. The main entrance is at the center of the north- facing front facade, recessed with sidelight windows. The opening is framed by pilasters and a broken pediment, and there is a Palladian window in the second floor above. The interior follows a central hall plan, with two chambers on either side of the central hall. The front left parlor has a distinctive carved fireplace overmantel surround, which surrounds a period wall painting with patriotic themes. The interior of the attic spaces preserves the framework of a hip roof. with The house's construction date is uncertain; it was probably built about 1796, when Martin Chittenden married, and was most likely a wedding present from Martin's father Thomas. Thomas Chittenden was Vermont's first governor, and Martin continued the political activities of his father, serving as governor during the War of 1812. This house, along with others built by Thomas Chittenden for his other sons, rank among the most imposing houses of the period in the area. The artwork over the parlor fireplace mantel is one of the most distinctive and well-preserved examples of patriotic folk art of the period.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=593931 on 2016-10-05 Description The length of an adult shell attains 36 mm, its diameter 13 mm. (Original description) The elongate, white shel is acutely fusiform. It contains nine rather rounded whorls following the (lost) protoconch. The general aspect recalls Fusiturricula fusinella but is larger and with a proportionally more swollen body whorl. The fifth whorl and the ninth whorl show nine short protractive axial ribs confined to the shoulder and periphery. The whorls are covered with spiral threads of which two marginating the suture and two on the periphery are more conspicuous than the rest, but not perceptibly nodulous. Between the peripheral cords there are, on the later whorls, from two to four minor threads.;On the base of the body whorl there are six or seven major, as many intermediate, and about a dozen minor threads. The suture is very closely appressed and the anal fasciole nearly free from axial and with only very fine spiral threads. The anal sulcus is wide and deep beginning at the suture. The outer lip is thin, much produced, roundly arcuate to the somewhat constricted base of the whorl. The aperture, including the siphonal canal, is as long as the spire. The columella is smooth, white and not callous. Obliquely attenuated in front, the siphonal canal is ample. Flaring a little in front, axis impervious. The back of the siphonal canal is closely spirally threaded. W.H.

History  On 3 February 1944 the Bishop of Mazara, monsignor Salvatore Ballo, gave the permit to build this church, and they start works on 22 January 1945. Thanks to the priest Bartolomeo Palumbo, it was founded in 1946 on a piece of land given by a lady and built after the plan of Giuseppe Russo, an engineer; it already became a parish in 1947.Carlo Cataldo, Guida storico-artistica dei beni culturali di Alcamo-Calatafimi-castellammare Golfo p.82, Alcamo, Sarograf, 1982 The same year, the parson, Father Palumbo, founded the male and female Congregation of saint Joseph the Worker; every year, on 23 January, they celebrated the festivity of Saint Joseph's Marriage, by taking part to the Mass, during which the married couples were blessed. Later both the congregations joined the parish Association of Azione Cattolica.Carlo Cataldo, La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.190, Alcamo, Campo, 2001. In 1949 he founded the male and female Congregations of Maria Santissima di Fatima: the scope was that of solemnizing the month of May and the feast of Our Lady of Fatima on May 13, moreover they had to take part to the Mass on the first Saturday each month. They also joined the Associations of Azione Cattolica later. Saint Joseph the Worker is celebrated on May 1, in the district of San Ciusippuzzu. Besides religious ceremonies and the procession, there are musical and theatrical shows and bike races.  Father Palumbo  Corteo funebre di Padre Palumbo Father Palumbo was born in Alcamo on 29 August 1915 and became a priest in 1941; he soon had the office of Vicar Cooperator in the parishes of the Church of the Saints Paul and Bartholomew, Church of the Holy Crucifix (or Saint Francis of Paola) and Church of the Holy Souls in Purgatory. He was also nominated as honorary Canon (priest) of the collegiate church of the Mother church. On bare feet, with a cross on his hands and a great number of believers, on 30 April 1944 he went towards the quarter of Balatelle (a suburb at that time) on the piece of land which had been donated to him by Mrs. Annunziata Macaluso, the widow of the chemist doctor Fazio,Vincenzo Regina: La chiesa parrocchiale di San Giuseppe in Alcamo; Grafiche Campo, 2005 put down the cross there and, since then, every Sunday he celebrated the Holy Mass on a makeshift altar.Tommaso PapaÀê Memorie storiche del clero di Alcamo; ediz.Accademia di studi Cielo d'Alcamo, Alcamo, 1968 Until he stayed in seminary he was a great devotee of Saint Joseph: during the night he got up, kneeled and recited the rosary in honour of him, this prayer in dialect, very interesting also from the symbolical point of view: Scura stasira agghiorna dumani la pruvvidenza m‚Äôaviti a mannari.http://win.lasberla.com/Cultura-trapani/2225-comunicazione-evento-- della-traslazione-salma-sac-bartolomeo-palumbo-#. (It was a prayer asking for Providence from the Saint). He asked for saint Joseph's protection both for his family and the Church, then he put his project on the Saint's hands. In 1947 he succeeded in completing the basement below the Church and start celebrating Mass there.[4] With his zeal and faith, Father Palumbo succeeded in dragging all the district and citizens to contribute to the costs for completing the building of the Church by any type of offerings, even in kind (wheat, eggs, legumes, flour, etc.). He used all these things, however, to help a lot of people in need too; there are so many stories about his great goodness. He succeeded also in creating a parish community very united and open to charity. With the bishop's bull of May 3, 1947, the Church was elevated to a parish and the following day the Bishop of Mazara del Vallo, His Excellency Monsignor Ballo, gave father Palumbo the canonical possession. Father Palumbo's mother, signora Vita Rocca, had donated her dowry for the legal recognition of the Parish, which was given with the Decree of the President of Republic on 10 June 1948. On 30 May he died, leaving his parish community and the whole town in anguish for his untimely end: there were thousands of people at his funeral. He was buried in the old cemetery Cappuccini in Alcamo and, after the approval by His Excellency Mons. Alessandro Plotti, on 22 October 2013, by popular demand of believers, his mortal remains were moved to his Church.  Description and works  The fa√ßade is elegant and in Romanesque style; the interior is with one nave and a coffered ceiling. There are these works: : *Wooden statue of saint Joseph with the Infant Jesus in his arms made by Giuseppe Di Caro, a sculptor from Palermo, in 1952. The mantle of the saint is covered with pure gold, and their clothes with silver. *An Angel trumpet player and the Angel musician: both chromium-plated by Gino Patti, the surrealist painter from Alcamo, on the walls behind the high altar *Wooden statue of Our Lady of Fatima, right altar, realized by Giuseppe Stuflesser from Ortisei (Bolzano) in 1949 *Statue of Christ the King, left altar, realized by Luigi Santifaller in 1954.

It protects an area of Atlantic Forest. Location The Serra do Barbos√£o Municipal Nature Park is in the municipality of Tangu√°, Rio de Janeiro. It has an area of about . The park is in the north of the municipality, and covers 6.2% of its area. The Serra do Barbos√£o, together with the Serra do Samb√™ and the Serra de Santa F√©, holds well-preserved stretches of Atlantic Forest. The Serra do Barbos√£o is considered to be the main environmental heritage of the municipality. The park contains the remains of a slave cemetery. It is a popular location for walking, hiking and camping. The Serra do Barbos√£o is part of the Samb√™ - Santa F√© ‚Äì Barbos√£o ecological corridor, and indirectly influences the neighboring municipalities of Rio Bonito, Silva Jardim and Cachoeiras de Macacu in helping preserve the forest remnants and local biodiversity. As of 2011 there was no management plan and expropriation of land for the park was incomplete. The area was suffering from encroachment and deforestation. Tangu√° has one of Brazil's four fluorite mines, accounting for 11% of national production, an open pit and underground operation near the park. Potential contamination was a concern. History The Serra do Barbos√£o Municipal Nature Park was created by municipal law 6333 of 23 October 2007. Objectives included protecting and preserving remnants of Atlantic Forest, preserving and maintaining genetic diversity of important examples of flora and fauna, supporting recreation, environmental education and scientific research, and protecting water resources. The park was included in the Central Rio de Janeiro Atlantic Forest Mosaic, created in December 2006. In March 2016 the state government's Instituto Vital Brazil received approval for a project to survey flora and fauna in the park, including birds, reptiles, butterflies and moths. Among other benefits, the survey would provide material for environmental and health education at Vital Brazil's Tangu√° Campus.

These are crossed by about eighteen larger spiral cords on the body whorl, seven of which are on the body of the whorl and the rest on the beak and the siphonal canal. The former are turgid where they cross the ribs, and in the interspaces have one to three much finer threads. The latter are more or less undulate, but have hardly any or no spiral secondary threads. The anal sulcus is shallow and wide. The aperture is rather narrow The thin outer lip is produced and simple. The whitish columellar lip is smoot.

It is 371 pages long, containing an acknowledgments section consisting of an acclaim page, an introduction to the book, a photograph of the author with her two younger siblings, an information page about the edition, a Joan Didion quote, and a map of Phillips County, where the story is set. The content is divided into 14 chapters: *Breaking Clean: The opening chapter is a retelling and summary of Judy's life. *A Place of One's Own: This chapter describes Judy's parents move to their own ranch and the birth of the twins. *Salvage: This tells the story of the introduction of electricity at the ranch, and the changes it brought to their lives. *Church and State: This chapter is about when Judy starts school at South First Creek School, at the age of five. *Lessons in Silence: The chapter is about Judy's first encounter with outsiders, and the isolation created by ranch life. *Fighting Fire: The chapter summarizes a large fire that threatened the ranches, and the community joining together to fight it. *Ajax: This chapter contains several stories about how people on the ranches saw animals and their purpose. *The Year of the Horse: This chapter includes the story of when Gail, Judy's younger sister, entered a bull enclosure. *Learning Curves: This describes when Judy moved to Malta to start her freshman year in high school, and her difficulty fitting in. *The Reckoning: The chapter is about Judy's sophomore year of high school in Malta. *Learning the Ropes: In this chapter Judy describes her first months of being a ranch wife. *Winter Kill: This is about when her daughter got sick and the difficulties of getting to hospital due to heavy rains. *Night Shift: The chapter tells the story of calving on the ranch. *Afterword: Leaving Home: In the final chapter Judy describes leaving the ranch to start a new life. The chapters Breaking Clean and Lessons in Silence and a portion of Learning Curves were originally published, in slightly different form, in Northern Lights magazine, while the chapter Salvage was originally published in Big Sky Journal magazine. Plot The book narrates the author's story from before her birth, intertwining it with her current life, and explains how her life changed after she left the ranch. =The family and life before Judy's birth= Judy's family is the fourth generation of a ranching family. The author describes the difficult moments that her parents had to deal with, when three years after they were married they decided to establish their own ranch. The main problems included lack of economic resources and the working of the land to make it viable. All the difficulties with starting their own place were interconnected with her birth in 1954, since Judy's mother was pregnant with her at the time. =Ranch life= Map of Montana highlighting Phillips County The book describes the hardship of growing up as a girl on a ranch in Phillips County, in a social context in which boys were more valued. It was the male kittens that were kept, and the community applauded the birth of stud colts, bull calves and male babies. When Judy was young she played cowboys and Indians with her siblings, but there was a difference in what was expected from a girl and a boy. In the community, several women were capable of riding horses, herding cattle and harvesting, but they were always expected to return to their own chores. Although Judy acted like a boy, she still had to learn women‚Äôs chores and to develop as a woman, in order to find a good marriage prospect. Cook Stoveleft Between the ages of five and thirteen Judy went to South First Creek School. Her class consisted of students of many different ages, which resulted in difficulties for the teacher in controlling the class. Every morning the teacher did a health inspection. If they passed the inspection, they got a gold star. Judy's little sister Gail was a very good storyteller and people would listen to her stories with excitement. Judy realized that she was not as good at telling stories but was better at writing them, so she secretly started to write poems and witty news on tablet paper to tell stories. When starting high school, Judy had to move into the city, Malta. It was different from what she was used to and she had never seen girls look and behave the way they did. She lived on her own at this point, and got a job to be able to afford clothes and makeup in order to fit in. When the twins started high school, her mother decided to move with them to Malta and they all moved into Judy's grandmother's house, which made Judy's life more isolated. She got into a lot of trouble during this time, until she moved back to the ranch. right When Judy was 15 years old, John, a 27-year-old bachelor neighbor, started courting her, and a year and a half later he asked Judy's father for her hand and they were engaged. After Judy and John were married, they took over John's family's main ranch house. At the beginning of their marriage, Judy felt that John's father and stepmother were constantly controlling her every move. The period after their children were born is described as an exhausting time‚Äîtaking care of the garden, three kids and three men, while still keeping up with the household work. =Life after the ranch= In August 1986, Judy left Phillips County out of frustration, with a divorce and three children, and within days she started her freshman year at the University of Montana. It was difficult to find a job that fitted around classes and the family. Eventually she started working in construction, sanding floors to earn enough money to feed her children. It was around this time that she found her voice again and began to write. The author explains how her children grew up differently than she or her parents did, as they did not have to face the hard work of country life and the strict education dictated by her parents. Narrative structure The story is structured without a sequential time of events: the narrative is full of flashbacks (both internal and external analepses). There are several types of narrative sequences: narration, descriptions, dialogues, together with the author's thoughts, like internal monologues. The background continuously changes from one paragraph to another. The narrative is always characterized by the stream- of-consciousness voice. For the narrative structure, the author uses a peculiar strategy, which creates two different stylistic and temporal dimensions. In fact, the narration itself follows a linear chronology of the events, so the plot is a straight line which respects the relation between story and plot. However, the author seasons the narration with flashbacks, personal comments and thoughts on the events, stopping the narration and zeroing time in the linear chronology. Moving the attention onto the narrative structure of the main character, the author herself, reviewers refer to her as the \\"ego in the centre\\" character, which means that all of the narration develops around her and everything that happens must be seen and understood by her point of view. That's also known as \\"the model of the onion\\", as the narrative structure follows the stratifications of the main character. Moreover, this model affected the presentation and the role of the other characters who take part in the story; All their actions and physical descriptions depend on the view of the author/protagonist; They are one of the figurative stratifications of this \\"onion\\" who is Judy Blunt. Some critics also asserted that the narrative structure is continuously shaped in this production by a metaphysical presence or element that belongs to the liberal and old-feminists way of interpreting writing; in fact, as Judy Blunt says, writing was a way to escape the ranch sexist hierarchy and at the same time a concealed way to protest against a minor role of women in society. This critique was made because, according to the reviewers, the reader is almost forced to adapt their view to the writer's in relation to these social issues, making more genuine the core of the book. This could be considered in every aspect a biographical production, however, the author has a wide freedom in the literal and stylistic choices, as it is a personal narration of her life that goes beyond the writing style, but all the canons of genre have been respected. Characters =Main characters= *Judy: Judy is the author of the book. She was born in 1954 and the book recounts her life written from her perspective in first person. *Judy's parents: The author describes her parents as very different from each other. When they married, her father was a 20-year-old cowboy, while her mother, Shirley, was a divorced 28-year-old woman with a four-year-old child, Margaret, born from her previous marriage. She describes her mother as a peculiar woman who attended college for two years, but who was also able to manage a house, a farm, and a family since youth. Judy describes their behaviour regarding her emotions that they did not approve of or did not understand as \\"blind\\", as they did not seem to even acknowledge it; for example, when Judy at 17 was home alone, she drank two glasses of her father's whiskey and repeatedly punched her left hand through a glass door, wearing her new engagement ring, and then smeared blood all over doors, mirrors and walls. After taking her to the hospital to treat her injured hand, her mother cleaned the house in silence, and neither of her parents ever wanted to know the gesture, not even after the publication of the book. *John: John is her ex-husband, 12 years older than her and a Vietnam veteran. He started courting Judy when she was 15 and he was 27. Years after they married, Judy and John faced relationship issues and sought help from a marriage counselor. Judy depicts him in a nonjudgmental way as a fair and patient man, yet weak-willed when it came to taking a stand against the patriarchal monopoly. =Secondary characters= *Judy's children: Judy has three children; Jeanette, Jason and James. Jeanette was born two years after Judy's marriage to John. Seventeen months after Jeanette was born Judy gave birth to her first son Jason, and two and a half years later James was born. *Margaret: Margaret is the author's stepsister, born from her mother's previous marriage and eight years older than the author. She started her studies at Malta High School at the age of 12 and graduated at 16. Even before she left home to study at college, or to work during the summer, she used to visit the family at the ranch only during weekends and holidays. *Kenny: Kenny is Judy's brother and around 20 months older than Judy. *The twins: The twins, Gary and Gail, are Judy's younger brother and sister. Blunt, Judy: Breaking Clean Background leftThe story is set in Phillips County on a remote ranch in northeastern Montana, where Judy was born: more than one hour's drive on difficult dirt roads to the nearest town, Malta. As the author herself wrote in the first pages of the book, the town was blessed by a wide community of writers and therefore she had the possibility to get in touch with this world early and frankly. Wringer Washing Machineright The cattle farm on which the author grew up was a typical ranch, described by Judy as livable and long- lasting, although not charming. The threshold was surrounded by a porch, decorated with linoleum cabbage flowers. The kitchen consisted of a square kitchen table, a double-oven cook stove, and a washbasin. Judy's bedroom, shared with her sister, had a foldaway cot and was next to the bathroom, which was provided with a wringer washing machine, a claw-foot bathtub and a pump used to obtain the household water. Several improvements to the house were made with the introduction of electricity in the ranch in the late 50s. The environment which surround the story enforces the differences that came about between the \\"dutiful wife\\" and the \\"marlboro man\\"; in fact during those years women still lived in a sexist society, and the author enriches the stylistic choice of elements which underline the differences that occur between male figures and female figures. The sexist environment Judy lived in influenced her life as a writer, even if in her community there were many people who had already undertaken this career, as often writing for her was an escape from ranch life. =Writers community= Judy Blunt has identified the wide range of writers in the community of Missoula, and is part of a Writing circle in the area. After her ranch life, she attended the University of Montana, which represented a turning point in her story as a writer. This university has a reputation for literature faculties, high quality of teaching and mix of people from different backgrounds. Montana is a northern state of the confederation of the United States, near to the Canadian border, still featured by a wild and virgin nature and its position made this territory attractive for people from different backgrounds: Canadians, French, Eastern Europeans, English, Americans from the South looking for virgin and uncontaminated forests, and many others. The university's Faculty of Literature is attended by aspirant writers, who share their backgrounds and ideas and stimulate the birth of new and effective writing styles. In this environment, many people decide to become writers and often obtain successful results, as in the case of Judy Blunt. Due to this high quantity of successful writers, some of them have founded a non profit organization, the Missoula Writers Collaborative, in which many old and new authors, most of whom come from University of Montana, take part to keep the traditions of creative writing by placing \\"writers in school classrooms, after-school programs, youth homes and other venues to show young people the power of words and help them find their voices as writers\\". left As one of the professors of the faculty says, thanks to the success of \\"Breaking Clean\\" and other books, the writers and the university together have been able to identify a model, ‚Äúthe writing school of Missoula, Montana‚Äù as the French call it, and export this writing circle model to other universities. Montana has a reputation of being a rough country that exports raw materials, and the people of Montana were considered to a certain extent \\"brutal\\" as prejudicial. However, thanks to this constantly growing heritage of publications and the mission of the writers' organization in the University of Montana, they are projecting onto the world a sophisticated and cultural dimension of Missoula and of Montana. Controversies When the book was published, it caused trouble in her hometown of northeast Montana. Blunt's ex-husband described himself as \\"shell- shocked\\" and added that \\"a lot of people in this county are disturbed\\", while her parents were reluctant to discuss the substance of the memoir. \\"Judy sure has a way with words\\" is all her mother, Shirley, would say. The author's former father-in-law accused her of fabricating a scene in the opening chapter, which was originally a classroom essay that she wrote in her sophomore year of college. In the chapter she recounted how one day her father-in-law, furious at her for being late at the table for lunch, took her new typewriter outside and \\"killed it with a sledgehammer\\". Blunt's former in- laws publicly repudiated the account, stating that no such thing had ever happened, and later Blunt admitted that she wrote that as an essay and when trying to fit her life into four pages for the classroom exercise, she wrote \\"more of a prose poem\\" and the episode was meant to be read symbolically, to represent what she had to endure on her husband's ranch. This particular scene in Blunt's essay is what in 1993 landed her a $100,000 advance for the memoir she had only begun to write, and Ms Desser, her editor, convinced her to make that essay the first chapter in the book, not without considerable objection from the author. Ms Desser commented that the essay \\"compresses the essence of her book the same way that an overture contains an entire piece of music,\\" adding that she was not aware of the factual problems. To avoid further controversies the publisher decided to delete the episode from future editions of the book. \\"The metaphor was perfect, but in a book of nonfiction one cannot defend using an image like that at the expense of another person. If it did not occur, except metaphorically, I should not have put it in this book,\\" Blunt commented, clearly embarrassed by the mistake, and added \\"I hope this can be taken in perspective and it does not become what my book is about. It is ironic that I worked ten years writing this book and four hours writing this essay. But there it is. It is just one of them things.\\" When Judy left the ranch at the age of 32 with her small children, her family felt that she left for no good reason. Her husband did not treat her badly, as in he did not beat her, he was not a drunk, he did not chase other women, and their ranch was doing well. After the book was published, they avoided commenting on the matter discussed in the book. \\"My parents are of the old school,\\" Blunt said, \\"if you say to them you feel a certain way and they don't understand or approve of the way you feel, they say, 'No you don't'.\\" Her family was hurt by her decision to leave and worried about how she would survive, but today they have mended their relationship. Her parents recently sold most of their 15,000-acre ranch and most of the cattle shortly after the publication of the memoir and have retired into town, while her ex-husband remarried and still lives on his ranch.

Minnesota was won by the Democratic candidate, incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt won the state over dark horse Republican nominee Wendell Willkie of New York by a margin of 47,922 votes, or 3.83%. Nationally, Roosevelt was re- elected to an unprecedented third term as president, with 449 electoral votes and a 9.97% lead over Willkie in the popular vote. Roosevelt was the only president of the United States who was elected to more than two quadrennial terms. He was also elected to a fourth term in 1944, although he died in office during that term. The 22nd Amendment, ratified on February 27, 1951, ensures that Roosevelt will continue, indefinitely, to be the only president of the United States to be elected to more than two terms, as the said amendment prohibits any person from serving more than two and a half terms as president.

It was found in 1895 in a tomb at Tarquinia, and is now in the National Museum at Tarquinia (22.2 cm high; Museum inv. no. RC 2010Joan Aruz, Sarah Graff, Yelena Rakic (editors): Assyria to Iberia: At the Dawn of the Classical Age, New York, New Haven 2014, , pp. 318-319). The vessel, often also labelled as situla and made of Egyptian faience, bears an inscription with the names of the 24th Dynasty pharaoh Wahkare Bakenrenef (Ancient Greek: Bocchoris) who ruled about 720 to 715 BC. It shows the king between the Egyptian goddess Neith and the god Horus in the middle register, on one side and on the other between Horus and Thoth. In the lower register are shown Kushite prisoners between monkeys eating dates from palm trees, a depiction which was considered by Egyptologist Toby Wilkinson as racial propaganda. The vessel is an important evidence for long distance trade in the 9th and 8th century BC. It is furthermore of some importance for dating earlier phases of Etruscan culture in Italy. Because of the good preservation of the vessel, it has been argued that it came very shortly after it was made into the Etruscan tomb. The place of production of the vase is under discussion. The object appears on the first view fully Egyptian. The hieroglyphs are readable. However, some researchers regard the vase as a product of a Phoenician workshop, since it is known that the Phoenicians often produced objects in Egyptian style.Glenn Markoe: Phoenicians, Berkeley, Los Angeles, 2000, , p. 158 The Phoenician origin was suggested after the discovery of a similar ‚Äì yet of a somewhat lower quality ‚Äì vessel near Motya, Sicily. However, the finding at Tarquinia of two situliform vessels with the names of Psamtik I and Psamtik II respectively, again suggested a Lower Egyptian origin of the Bocchoris vase.Francocci, Stefano, \\"La diffusione degli Aegyptiaca tra Etruria meridionale e Agro Falisco\\", in S. Francocci, R. Murgano (eds.): \\"La cultura egizia ed i suoi rapporti con i popoli del Mediterraneo durante il I millennio a.C.. Atti del Convegno Internazionale, Viterbo, 6-7 novembre 2008\\", note 39. The vase was found in 1895 in a tomb chamber with a pitched roof and a bench. The tomb owner might be a woman judging from the objects found: gold foil plaques might have adorned clothing; many Egyptian beads were found (two beads show the Egyptian god Bes); there were bronze and pottery vessels.Robert Leighton: Tarquinia, An Etruscan City, London 2004, , p. 62 Due to the Bocchoris vase being the best known object from the tomb, by metonymy the whole tomb is often called \\"Bocchoris Tomb\\",Francocci, op. cit. p. 48 despite not having any connection with the actual burial place of king Bakenrenef/Bocchoris, which is still unknown.

Books authored * Fatah: Islam, Nationalism and Politics of armed struggle (Resling, 2012) (in Hebrew). * Students and Resistance In Palestine: Books, Guns, and Politics (Routledge, 2015) In his first book, published in Hebrew, Zelkovitz argues that fatah is not a secular political movement, but rather a traditional national liberation movement with religious background. Zelkovitz relates to the importance of Islam in the movement's political discourse and its cultural world. In his second book, Zelkovitz explores the Palestinian Student Movement from an historical and sociological perspective. This book demonstrates how Palestinian national identity has been built in the absence of national institutions, whilst emphasizing the role of higher education as an agent of social change, capable of crystallizing patterns of national identity. The book, was the first one that focuses on the political and social activities of Palestinian students in two arenas‚Äîthe West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the Palestinian diaspora in the years 1952-2000. The book investigates the shared goal of the several movements in securing independence and the building a sovereign Palestinian state, comparing their development, social impact and the differing challenges each movement faced. Publicistic writing and activity Zelkovitz writes publicistic and analyst columns and he is a commentator in the global media. He frequently appears as an analyst on Israeli TV news channels on issues related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Zelkovitz is writing extensively and giving comments on the Palestinian Political system, with an emphasis on the complex relationship between Fatah and Hamas. Zelkovitz columns were translated into Arabic, published and cited in Leading Arabic, Palestinian, and Lebanese Media. Zelkoivtz writing was quoted by political officials in the Palestinian political system such as Izzat al-Rishq from Hamas.

Huse Memorial School is a historic former school building at 39 Andrews Street in Bath, Maine. Built in 1942, it is one of a small number of schools built in Maine with federal funding provided under the World War II- era Community Facilities Act. It was closed in 2006, and has been converted to residential use. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. Description and History The former Huse Memorial School building stands in a residential area west of downtown Bath known as Hyde Park Terrace, which was also part of the federal construction program to provide facilities for defense industry workers during World War II. It is basically a long two- story rectangle, with an enlarged auditorium wing at the left (southern) end. The exterior is unadorned brick, with windows that are mainly late 20th- century replacements of original double-hung wood frame windows. The northern end of the building is a 1949 addition, whose features included more distinctive Modern touches, including the use of glass blocks.Beard, Christine (2016). NRHP nomination for John E.L. Huse Memorial School; available by request from the Maine Historic Preservation Commission The school was built in 1942 to a design by Alonzo J. Harriman, an architect who was a native of Bath and a graduate of Harvard University. It was built by the federal government under the terms of the Community Facilities Act of 1940 (also known as the \\"Lanham Act\\"), which provided for the construction of housing and other facilities for workers in defense industries critical to the war effort. The demand for workers at the Bath Iron Works overtaxed the area's housing supply, and the Hyde Terrace subdivision was one of several built by the government to address the housing shortage. The Huse school, named for Bath native John Huse, the city's first casualty of the war, was built to provide schooling to the children of the new development. It was turned over to the city in 1948, and used as a school until 2006. The building has been adapted to contain residential units, with a new wing added.

As an organization, it claims to develop a participatory evidence-based policy dialogue, intending to achieve policy alternatives that promote sustainable, inclusive, and human-centered development.  Syrian civil war study  Based in Damascus until 2016, the SCPR, which is regarded as one of the most reliable local sources for information about the Syrian civil war since it is unaffiliated with any government or opposition group, estimated the number of dead due to the war as 470,000, as of 2016. The study asserts that the dead include civilians and combatants, and states that as many as two million people were injured. The study also stated that during the years of the war between 2011 and 2016 over 6 million Syrian refugees tried to escape the violence. Strategic objectives According to the SCPR, objectives include helping people in Syria to better initiate and engage in an open, respectful, and informed dialogue on key issues of public policy. Values The published values of the SCPR include: * Empowerment for all * Information for all * Inclusiveness * Equality in society by supporting the excluded, deprived, and marginalized * Participation, transparency, and accountability * High research ethics * Independence * Serving public interest Vision: An accountable transparent evidence-based, policy making process in Syria, supported by an active socio-economic dialogue, and dynamic public, private, and civil society partnership in which a credible professional research community produces knowledge for policy and public opinion.

History The original ch√¢teau was built around 1630 in the reign of Louis XIII by Sebastian le Hardy whose family lived there until 1791. Louis XIV is said to have visited around 1651 and commented that the chateau was \\"bien trouss√©\\" (\\"well fitted-out\\"), perhaps suggesting the origin of the name Ch√¢teau de la Trousse. The King bestowed the title of Marquis on the le Hardy family in 1651. The ch√¢teau was renovated and improved during the 1680s when the then owner, Marquis Phillipe-August le Hardy, employed the services of the famous architect Liberal Bruant, the architect of the Hotel des Invalides in Paris. In 1684, their only child, Marie-Henriette le Hardy, married a north Italian prince, Amede-Adolphe dal Pozzo, Marquis de Vognere. Phillipe-August le Hardy died in 1691 and Amede and Marie-Henriette dal Pozzo inherited the estate. Their granddaughter subsequently inherited and sold the estate in 1791 to a new family, Charles- Guillaume Baudon, the Comte de Mony Colchen. The estate fell into disrepair during the French Revolution. In 1814, the Napoleonic army set fire to the orangery as a signal about the approaching Cossacks. In 1829, the owners allowed speculators to sell the building materials to raise much needed cash. New ch√¢teau In 1865, the grandson of the 1791 buyer, Count Charles-Victor Baudon de Mony-Colchen, completed the construction of the new ch√¢teau that stands today. He also arranged the renovation of the original orangery and stable courtyard (that date from 1630), and the new gardens. During the latter part of the First World War, US troops were garrisoned at the ch√¢teau in conjunction with the battles at Ch√¢teau Thierry and Belleau Wood. When the war ended, the Count erected the war memorial at the entrance to the ch√¢teau on the D401, in gratitude that his son had survived. During the Second World War, La Trousse was commandeered by the Germans and the attics of the courtyard were used as a field hospital. Allied troops advanced from Normandy and reached La Trousse on August 24, 1944. A tank battle ensued and a German tank was hit on the driveway. Fighting ceased the following day when Paris was liberated on August 25, 1944. The ch√¢teau stayed in the ownership of the Baudon family until 1998 when Count Xavier Baudon de Mony sold the estate to a Dutch owner, Hans Musegaas. The de Mony family could not afford the rising costs of upkeep and the children decided they could not take on the responsibilities. The ch√¢teau and buildings have since been renovated and divided into a number of private apartments. The co-owners take joint responsibility for the upkeep and improvements to the ch√¢teau and its 40-acre estate. Notable features at Ch√¢teau de la Trousse include the chapel, the prison and pigeonary. \\\\- \\\\-  References  Category:Castles in √éle-de-France Category:Buildings and structures completed in the 17th century ","title":"Ch√¢teau de la Trousse"},{"id":"51873852","text":"Basketballklubben BMS or commonly known as BMS is a professional basketball club based in the locality Ballerup-M√•l√∏v-Skovlunde, Denmark.

Tyumen, Tyumen State University Press. 2015. 584 p. Everything changed with the start of World War II in July 1941. During its first year, more than a hundred of students, professors and other staff members went to the front. Nevertheless, the Institute continued working. In February 1942, it hosted an academic conference where 20 papers in the fields of mathematics, chemistry, geography, psychology, literature, Russian language and anti-fascism were presented. Among the participants were scientists from Boris Zbarsky's laboratory, who came to Tyumen as an escort to the mummy of Lenin that was being evacuated from Moscow. The head of the department of natural sciences, Ilya Zbarsky, was a senior research fellow of the laboratory.

The store remains active to this day among an ever-growing expansion of stores throughout Idaho, Oregon, Washington, and Utah. Their corporate headquarters resides in Meridian, Idaho, and is managed by Bob and his son Trent. An important factor in the company's success was Bob's acquiring of the Bridgestone tire line in 1969, a time when it was fairly new to the US market and yet to grow popular. Bridgestone is still one of Commercial Tire's featured tire brands, along with Firestone, Cooper, and Yokohama tires.  Recognition  In 2015, industry news magazine Modern Tire Dealer listed Commercial Tire under their Top 100 Independent Tire Dealers and Top 25 Commercial Tire Dealers, ranked #30 and #16 respectively. Bob has also received honorable mention by the Idaho Business Review for his work as an influential CEO.

Kutrzeba (born Arie Fajwiszys in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland, October 11, 1927 and died in New York City, January 24, 2013) was a Polish-American theater producer and director. Family background: Israel Fajwiszys and Kutrzeba's early life Kutrzeba was the son of Israel Fajwiszys, a composer, and Malka (Hakman) Fajwiszys, both of whom perished in the Holocaust, along with their daughter, Kutrzeba's sister. Israel Fajwiszys was born in 1887 in Yampil,Yampil is a common place name in Ukraine. It is unclear which one was Israel's birthplace, and records may no longer exist. Ukraine. Having graduated from a music conservatoire, he led the choirs of the progressive synagogues in Brody and Tarn√≥w. After studying in Vienna, he was also the leader of the Krak√≥w Tempel Synagogue choir. He came to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ from Lviv in 1922 and he became a teacher in both girls' and boys' schools of the Jewish Secondary Schools Society. He was the co-organiser of a singing society \\"Szir\\". After the outbreak of World War II he moved to Warsaw, where he volunteered to help an underground military organisation. In the ghetto, with Kutrzeba, he organised a children's choir. Kutzreba's father Israel wrote the music to the poem M'khol Masada by Yitskhok Lamden. In 1937 Israel's girls' chorus won first prize in an all-Poland choral competition. Later in the Warsaw Ghetto, he would lead the children's choir in performances of the song recounting the Jewish resistance and sacrifice under Roman rule. During the ghetto uprising he was caught and transported together with his daughter to the extermination camp in Poniatowa in the Lublin area, where he was murdered. War and post-war life in Europe Kutrzeba was a member of a teenage resistance group in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. He escaped and met a priest, Reverend Stanis≈Çaw Falkowski, who gave him the patriotic Polish name of Joseph Kutrzeba. He found him work as a cowherd with neighboring farmers and helped him get Catholic ID papers. In 1977 Falkowski was honored by Yad Vashem, the international Holocaust heroism remembrance authority. The story of Kutrzeba and Falkowski's fifty year friendship was told in the documentary \\"Messengers of Hope: The Hidden Children of the Holocaust\\", produced by Jeff Kamen, Jonathan L. Kessler and Joseph Kutrzeba. Kutrzeba wrote in his memoir in May 1994: \\"During the first days of September 1942, at the age of 14, I jumped out of a moving train destined for Treblinka, through an opening (window) of a cattle car loaded to capacity with Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto. Wandering over fields, forests and villages, at first in the vicinity of Wo≈Çomin, and later of Zambr√≥w, I found myself, in late November, in the area of Hodyszewo (near ≈Åom≈ºa). Throughout my wandering, the peasants for the most part were amenable to put me up for the night and to feed me‚Äîsome either suspecting my origins or pressing me to admit it.\\" He attended L.M. University in Munich, Germany (B.A. equivalent) and at age 19 was the winner of the top literary prize for a World War II short story sponsored by the Polish Combatant Association in London. Emigration to the USA and later life Kutrzeba came to the United States in 1950 and served with the U.S. Army in the Korean War (5 decorations; 2 battle stars) and graduated from Yale Drama School in 1956 on 3 scholarships (M.F.A) and N.Y.U (Ph.D.) in 1974. He was the founder and producer of Queens Playhouse at Flushing Meadow and produced 10 plays. He was nominated for a Tony Award and a Drama Desk Award for best producer of the rock opera The Lieutenant. Kutrzeba remarked that the reason he decided to produce The Lieujtenant was \\"The show meant a lot to me on human values. I think the theme is one of cardinal importance to our times: The concept of obedience versus exercising one's own conscience.\\"The Philadelphia Inquirer, September 3, 1974 He won the Bronze Award in the International Film and TV Festival in New York for the documentary film \\"Children in the Holocaust\\" with Liv Ullmann, 1980 (English and Polish versions). He produced Helena: the Emigrant Queen, 1996 at La Mama and Kosciuszko Foundation. He is the author of the book The Contract: A Life for a Life. Kutrzeba was married twice, the first time to Valerie M. Hageman, from September 1955 to 1959, with one child, Karen Janina. He was married again on January 14, 1979 to Michaela Lacher.

It protects an area of mangroves in Guanabara Bay, not far from the city of Rio de Janeiro. Location The Guanabara Ecological Station (ESEC) is divided between the municipalities of Guapimirim (42.49%), Itabora√≠ (35.61%) and S√£o Gon√ßalo (3.57%) in Rio de Janeiro. It has an area of in the coastal marine biome. The ESEC protects an area of mangroves in the northeast of Guanabara Bay. It is entirely surrounded by the Guapi-Mirim Environmental Protection Area (APA). The ESEC covers the best preserved area of Guanabara Bay, with the least amount of human intervention. Management of the ESEC and the APA is integrated, with shared technical, material and financial resources. Environment The ESEC is at sea level. It receives water from the Guapi-Macacu, Macacu/Caceribu and Guaxindiba rivers. Temperatures range from with an average of . The ESEC contains a flat tidal region of fluvial-marine sediments, rich in organic matter, that supports the mangroves. These almost completely cover the ESEC and are either primary growth or secondary growth in an advanced stage of regeneration. The main species of mangrove are the Rhizophora mangle, Avicennia schaueriana and Laguncularia racemosa. In areas cleared by people there are invasive species such as Hibiscus pernambucensis, Acrostichum aureum and Typha species. Spartina alterniflora grasses and floating islands of Eichhornia crassipes are also found. Migratory birds include the osprey (Pandion haliaetus), semipalmated plover (Charadrius semipalmatus) and spotted sandpiper (Actitis macularius). History Before the ESEC was created the area was considered a naval area that could not be occupied, but despite this there were constant attacks on the environment. The scientific community joined with the representatives of the local community in a movement to protect the eastern portion of Guanabara Bay with its precious remnants of mangroves. This resulted in a technical study recommending an environmental protection area, and presidential decree 90.225 of 25 September 1984 established the Guapi- Mirim Environmental Protection Area, while the area that would become the ESEC was designated a Wildlife Protection Zone, with a higher level of protection. Due to the unique importance of the environments between the mouths of the Guaxindiba and the Guapi / Macacu rivers, the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) recommended creation of an ESEC to fully protect the area, which would result in increased marine life in the area and ensure sustainability of traditional extractive activities. The Guanabara Ecological Station was created by federal decree on 15 February 2006 with the objective of preserving remnants of mangroves in Guanabara Bay and the associated fauna and flora, and to support scientific research. It is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation. The ESEC is classed as IUCN protected area category Ia (strict nature reserve). The park was included in the Central Rio de Janeiro Atlantic Forest Mosaic, created in December 2006. The consultative council was created on 29 June 2011. The management plan was approved on 2 March 2012. An ordinance of 4 July 2012 defined criteria for allowing visits for recreational, educational or scientific research purposes in the APA, and for educational or research purposes in the ESEC.

Biography Born in Santa Monica, California, Waldberg moved to Paris as a child with his family. In 1932, and while still a student (age 19), he joined Boris Souvarine's Democratic Communist Circle. There he met Georges Bataille and his friends Michel Leiris and Andr√© Masson, and was initiated by them into a wild night life. Waldberg would chronicle those years in his novel La Cl√© de cendre (The key made of ashes), published posthumously in 1999.Patrick Waldberg, La cl√© de cendre, Paris: Editions de la Diff√©rence, 1999. 1937 saw him back in California to take care of \\"family matters\\". However, a letter from Georges Bataille reached him there, urging him to return to Paris in order to take part in a Nietzschean secret society Bataille was then forming, called Ac√©phale (\\"headless\\"). Waldberg heeded the call in September 1938, and he says this permanently changed his life. From 1938 to 1940 Waldberg would serve as the secretary of Bataille's \\"official\\" group, the College of Sacred Sociology.Patrick Waldberg, \\"Ac√©phalogramme\\", in Marina Galletti, ed., L'Apprenti-sorcier, Paris: Editions de la Diff√©rence, 1999. In the winter of 1939, Waldberg was invited by Georges Bataille to move in with him to his house in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, a suburb of Paris. In the fall of that year he joined the French army to help repel the German invasion. In March 1940, Isabelle Farner gave birth to his son . After the French defeat Patrick and Isabelle fled to the USA where they took up residence in New York. In 1941 Patrick became a founder of the \\"Voice of America\\" radio broadcasts. It seems it was he who then attracted Andr√© Breton to also become an announcer on Voice of America.In 1942 Waldberg quit Voice of America to join the US army intelligence service, taking part in the African campaign and then the Normandy invasion. During this time Isabelle stayed in New York.Biography - Editions de la Diff√©rence .Jos√© Pierre, ¬´ WALDBERG PATRICK - (1913-1985) ¬ª, Encyclop√¶dia Universalis (online), accessed 5 October 2016. In 1959 he left Paris to move to the French village of Seillans, where his second wife Line Jubelin was from. Max Ernst and his own second wife Dorothea Tanning joined him there. Their houses are now a Max Ernst museum and a Maison Waldberg museum. In 1964 Waldberg organized a major Surrealist exhibit at Gallerie Charpentier. Andr√© Breton took umbrage at this however, due to Waldberg's defection in 1951. Breton and his group printed a declaration condemning the show, \\"\\"Face aux liquidateurs\\", and then a subsequent pamphlet, \\"Cramponnez- vous √† la table (Petite Suite surr√©aliste √† l'affaire du Bazar Charpentier)\\".

He specialized in treating gas inflicted patients. Early life Bailey was born in New Castle, Indiana. His parents were Reverend John Bailey and Cora Dempsey Bailey. In 1910, Bailey graduated from Meharry Medical College, at the age of 22. He was married by 1914. In 1917, after being a practicing physician for seven years, Bailey volunteered for service in World War I and was granted First Lieutenant in the Military Reserve Corps. Military service Bailey completed his training in 44 days and was sent to Fort Riley to be a part of the 92nd Division's medical unit.

Bailey was given specialized training for the treatment of gas casualties and he was later transferred to the 366th Field Hospital. The 92nd Division was facing aggressive assaults from the so the 366th Hospital frequently received ailments from such attacks. For the remainder of the war, Bailey worked tirelessly at the hospital which constantly filled with gas related ailments. Each hospital in the division was made to accommodate around 200 patients. In the course of three weeks alone, Bailey treated near to 200 gas injuries. The common ailments accompanying gas infestation were Mustard gas poisoning and Arsene poisoning, each causing excessive respiratory problems.

The Ghurid invaders defeated and killed his father Prithviraja III, while he was still a minor, and appointed him as a vassal ruler of the Chahamana kingdom. His uncle Hariraja dethroned him for accepting the Ghurid suzerainty. Subsequently, Govindaraja established a new branch of the Chahamana dynasty at Ranastambhapura (present-day Ranthambore).  Reign  Govinda-raja was born to the Chahamana king Prithviraja III. The 16th century Tarikh-i-Firishta names him as \\"Gola\\", which is probably a mistranscription of \\"Guva\\", a diminutive of \\"Govinda\\". In 1192 CE, the Ghurids invaded the Chahamana kingdom, defeating and killing Govindaraja's father. The victor Muhammad of Ghor then appointed Govindaraja as a vassal ruler. Since Prithviraja was around 30 years old at the time of his death, Govindaraja appears to have been a minor at the time of his ascension. During Govindaraja's short reign, the Ghurids subjugated the rebel Chahamana governors, including those at Delhi and Hansi. Govindaraja's uncle Hariraja rebelled against the Ghurid rule in Ajmer, forcing Govindaraja to take shelter in the Ranthambore Fort. The Ghurid governor Qutb al-Din Aibak rushed from Delhi to Ranthambore, and forced Hariraja's army to retreat. Govindaraja gifted three golden melons to the Ghurid governor to express his gratitude. Govindaraja then returned to Ajmer. However, in 1193 CE, Hariraja again invaded Ajmer, supported by Prithviraja's rebel generals. Once again, Govindaraja had to flee to Ranthambore. This time, Hariraja managed to occupy Ajmer, and became the new Chahamana king. Hariraja was defeated by the Ghurids in 1194 CE. Meanwhile, Govindaraja was granted the fief of Ranthambore. His son Valhana (or Balhana) ruled succeeded him on the Ranthambore throne as a vassal of the Delhi Sultanate.

After the Ghurid invaders defeated his brother Prithviraja III in 1192 CE, he dethroned his nephew Govindaraja IV, who had been appointed as a vassal ruler by the Ghurids. He ruled a part of his ancestral kingdom (in present-day Rajasthan) for a brief period, before being defeated by the Ghurids in 1194 CE.  Reign  Hariraja was a son of the Chahamana king Someshvara and queen Karpuradevi. He and his elder brother Prithviraja III were born in Gujarat, where their father Someshvara was brought up at the Chaulukya court by his maternal relatives. Prithviraja ascended the Chahamana throne after Someshvara's death, but his reign ended in 1192 CE with a Ghurid conquest of the kingdom. The Ghurids appointed Prithviraja's son Govindaraja IV as a vassal ruler in return for a heavy tribute. Hariraja revolted against the Ghurid rule in the Chahamana capital Ajmer, forcing Govindaraja to take shelter in the Ranthambore Fort. When the Ghurid governor Qutb al-Din Aibak heard about this, he rushed from Delhi to Ranthambore. Hariraja made a retreat, knowing that he would not be able to defeat the Ghurid army. While the Ghurids were busy fighting other Hindu dynasties such as the Gahadavalas, Hariraja once again invaded Ajmer in 1193 CE. This time, he managed to recapture Ajmer, and became the new Chahamana king, with support from Prithviraja's former general Skanda. Subsequently, Hariraja sent a force led by Jatira (called Jihtar or Jhitar in Muslim accounts) to capture Delhi. However, this force had to retreat in fear of a larger Ghurid army. As Jatira's force was returning to Delhi, Hariraja set out from Ajmer with another army in its support. The Ghurids decisively defeated the Chahamana forces in the ensuing battle. According to the 16th century Muslim historian Firishta, Hariraja and Jaitra were killed in this battle. However, the near contemporary 13th century source Taj-ul-Maasir states that Jaitra \\"sacrificed himself in the flames of a fire\\". Hammira Mahakavya by the Jain scholar Nayacandra Suri also states that Hariraja had to fall back to Ajmer, where he determined that any further resistance against the Ghurids was fruitless. As a result, he and his family then committed suicide by self- immolation. Hariraja's queen was Pratapadevi, as attested by an 1194 CE Tantoti inscription.

Minnesota was won by the Democratic candidate, New York governor Franklin D. Roosevelt won the state over incumbent President Herbert Hoover by a margin of 236,847 votes, or 23.62%. Nationally, Roosevelt won the election, with 472 electoral votes and a landslide 17.76% lead over Hoover in the popular vote. The election of 1932, the first held since the Wall Street Crash of 1929, was a realigning election which marked the effective end of the Republican- dominated Fourth Party System, and the beginning of the Fifth Party System, which led to the dominance of the New Deal Coalition in presidential politics until 1968. In Minnesota, a state in which Republicans had always previously been dominant, early warning of the Republicans' poor prospects for 1932 was given in the 1930 gubernatorial election, in which Farmer-Labor candidate Floyd B. Olson won the governorship by a landslide margin. Throughout most of the 1930s, Roosevelt would dominate presidential politics in Minnesota, while Olson and the Farmer-Laborites tended to dominate state politics. The eventual cooperation between the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party and the Democratic Party, fostered by Olson and Roosevelt, would lead to the establishment of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party in 1944. This is also the first time Minnesota voted for the Democrats in a presidential election since it gained statehood in 1858, and only the second time it did not support the Republican candidate, after Progressive Party candidate Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, and would vote for the Democratic candidates every time after, except the presidential elections of 1952, 1956, and 1972. , this is the last election in which Lake County voted for a Republican presidential candidate (incidentally it was the only county to vote Republican in this election) and the last election in which Carver County and Otter Tail County voted for a Democratic candidate.Sullivan, Robert David; ‚ÄòHow the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century‚Äô; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 Results { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"4\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\\" - style=\\"background-color:#E9E9E9\\" ! colspan=\\"6\\"  1932 United States presidential election in Minnesota -bgcolor=\\"#EEEEEE\\" align=\\"center\\" ! colspan=\\"2\\" style=\\"width: 15em\\" Party ! style=\\"width: 17em\\" Candidate ! style=\\"width: 5em\\" Votes ! style=\\"width: 7em\\" Percentage ! style=\\"width: 5em\\" Electoral votes - ! style=\\"background-color:#3333FF; width: 3px\\"   style=\\"width: 130px\\"  Democratic  Franklin D.
