Early life He was born, perhaps in County Cork, Ireland, in the latter part of 1612, the third son of Daniel Gookin of County Kent and County Cork and his wife, Mary Byrd. He was baptized 6 December 1612 at the church of St. Augustine the Less in Bristol. By 1616 his father was living in Carrigaline, Ireland, where Gookin probably spent his childhood, later being sent for education to England. On 1 February 1630/1, shortly after his eighteenth birthday, living at his father's plantation in Virginia, he was indentured to Thomas Addison, second manager of the Marie's Mount plantation. On Addison's retirement, he granted Daniel of land. No record of Gookin's first marriage has been found; on 11 November 1639 a license was granted for the marriage of Daniel Gookin, Gent., of the parish of St. Sepulchre, London, a widower, and Mary Dolling, of the parish of St. Dunstan in the West, London. Between his two voyages to Virginia, it is assumed that Gookin was in military service, as he is referred to as a Kentish \\"souldier\\" by Capt. Edward Johnson in his Wonder Working Providence, and \\"Captain\\" in Greer's list of immigrants to Virginia. In Virginia In early 1641 Daniel Gookin, his wife Mary, and their infant son Samuel set sail for Virginia and took up residence at the Nansemond plantation. He was made a Burgess and represented Upper Norfolk County in the Grand Assembly which met in Jamestown on 12 January 1641/2. He received a grant of in the upper county of Norfolk on the northwest of the Nansemond River on 29 December 1637, and a further on the Rappahannock River on 4 November 1642. On 24 May 1642 a letter was sent to the Puritan elders of the Church in Boston in the Colony of Massachusetts, asking for ministers, who were in short supply in Virginia. William Thompson of Braintree, John Knowles of Emmanuel College, and Thomas James of New Haven were sent to Virginia. Gookin was among those welcoming them, and became closely associated with Thompson.\\"A constellation of great converts there, Shone round him, and his heavenly glory were GOOKINS was one of these; by Tompson's pains, CHRIST and NEW ENGLAND a dear GOOKINS gains\\". Cotton Mather, Magnalia Christi Americana, 1:398 However, Governor Berkeley, an adherent to the Church of England, gave them a frigid reception, and at the next meeting of the Assembly in March 1642/3, an act of conformity was passed.\\"For the preservation of the purities of doctrine and unitie of the church, It is enacted that all ministers whatsoever which shall reside in the collony are to be conformable to the orders and constitution of the Church of England, and the laws therein established, and not otherwise to be admitted to teach or preach publickly or privatly, And that the Gov. and Council do take care that all nonconformists upon notice of them shall be compelled to depart the collony with all convenience\\". (Hennings, Statutes at Large 1:277). Knowles and James left Virginia for New England in April. Thompson, accompanied by Gookin, emigrated in the summer of 1643 to Maryland, where, though under Catholic rule, non-conformists were welcome and tolerated, and where Gookin acquired land near the South and Severn Rivers, near the site of Annapolis. Gookin's brother John died at Lynn Haven early in November 1643; Gookin, no longer bound by any strong ties to Virginia, left his three plantations in the charge of servants and sailed for Boston in May 1644 with his wife and his infant daughter Mary (his son Samuel having died). They arrived in Boston on 20 May 1644, and six days following he was admitted to membership in the First Church. He resided initially at Roxbury, where he was a near neighbor of Rev. John Eliot, Sr., pastor of the First Church of Roxbury and known as the \\"Apostle to the Indians\\". Gookin's daughter Elizabeth (baptized 1645) (who was later to marry John Eliot's son, then Edmund Quincy (1628–1698)), and Hannah (baptized 1646) were born at Roxbury, and Gookin was one of the founders of the free grammar school established there in 1645. He was appointed a deputy from Roxbury to the General Court. On 6 April 1648 Gookin sold of his plantation on the Rappahannock to Capt. Thomas Burbage. In New England In July 1648, the Gookin family removed to Cambridge, where he was appointed Captain of the Trained Band, a position he held for the next forty years.The practice then prevailed for a captain to retain command of his company however highly promoted, the immediate command being exercised by the Lieutenant. Thus, while in later years Gookin was Major-General, he was still Captain of the Cambridge company. This unit comprised one of the original elements from which there is direct descendancy to the 182nd Infantry Regiment of the present United States Army. Several muster entries note Gookin's attendance also at meetings of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Boston. In the spring of 1649, Gookin was chosen as Deputy from Cambridge to the General Court held in Boston. In July 1650, he was in London on public business; he returned in the spring of 1651, and on 7 May he was chosen Speaker. At the election on 26 May 1652 he was chosen an Assistant, one of the Council of eighteen magistrates to whom, with the Governor and a Deputy Governor, the government of the colony was entrusted. Except for a period early in 1676, when he suffered defeat largely because of his sympathetic treatment of Indians during King Philip's War, Gookin was re-elected to this position continuously for a period of thirty-five years. Gookin again returned to London, where Oliver Cromwell had been proclaimed Protector, and Daniel's cousin Vincent Gookin was a member of the first Protectorate Parliament. Cromwell asked that Daniel urge his fellows at Boston to become planters in Jamaica; however, Gookin was unsuccessful at gaining colonists, and returned to England.He reported his failure in a letter of 20 June 1657. Gookin became Collector of Customs at Dunkirk in March 1658/9. When King Charles II returned to Dover, Daniel fled to New England with the regicides General Edward Whalley and Colonel William Goffe. The regicides took up residence at Cambridge, which provoked the English government to appoint a board of commissioners to visit New England and ensure loyalty to the crown. The controversy was managed by the Massachusetts General Court who, largely due to the efforts of Gookin and Thomas Danforth, failed to accomplish their goals. In 1665, the attention of the General Court was brought to the rich lands in the vicinity of Lake Quinsigamond, which Rev. John Eliot had already visited. A committee on which Daniel Gookin served was appointed to view the land and to report \\"whether it be capable of making a village, and what number of families may be there accommodated, and if they find it fit for a plantation.\\" In the report of this committee made October 20, 1668, the \\"good chestnut tree\\" and meadow land was recommended. The General Court accepted this report and appointed Captain Gookin of Cambridge, Daniel Henchman of Boston, Thomas Prentice of Woburn, and Lieutenant Richard Beers of Watertown to plan for a settlement. After purchasing the land from the natives for \\"twelve pounds lawful money,\\" lots were assigned, and the actual settlement began in 1673. Lots were given to Captains Gookin, Henchman, Prentice, and Lieutenant Beers. Houses were built and then the work suddenly ceased, owing to the outbreak of King Philip's War. All of the buildings erected by the settlers were burned, and Lieutenant Beers was killed in the fight. The settlement was deserted. A second attempt was made in 1685, and Captain John Wing was appointed to fill the place made vacant by the death of Lieutenant Beers. On the petition of Captains Gookin, Henchman, Prentice, and Wing, the settlement was named Worcester. This second settlement was destined to be even as disastrous as the first. Indian outbreaks marked the years between 1686 and 1713—the date of the third and successful settlement of Worcester. Besides his attendance at the sessions of the General Court and at the meetings of the Governor and Council, he served on committees to audit the Treasurer's (John Hull's) accounts, to treat with the mintmaster, to draw up orders concerning the militia, and to visit Harvard College and examine the treasurer's accounts. He served Cambridge as Selectman from 1660 to 1672, and was appointed the first Superintendent of the Praying Indians. In this capacity he traveled to Indian settlements, often accompanied by his friend Rev. Eliot. Gookin wrote two books on the Indians: Historical Collections of the Indians in New England (completed in 1674, published by the Massachusetts Historical Society, 1792), and The Doings and Sufferings of the Christian Indians (completed in 1677, published in 1836). He wrote also a History of New England, but only portions of this have survived. Last years The colony passed laws banning all printing in Massachusetts, except in Cambridge, and then permitting only licensed publications. In 1662 Gookin and Rev. Jonathan Mitchell were appointed as the first licensers of the press, but Gookin declined the position. The king, meanwhile, asked that the colonists submit themselves to him with regard to charter rights; Gookin opposed sending delegates to England, a position that carried the day, and won him great popularity. On 11 May 1681, he was elected Major-General, the Commander-in-Chief of the military forces of the colony. Though he continued, by argument and resistance, to oppose British encroachments upon the colonists' political and commercial liberties, his last year was darkened by the abrogation of the charter government by King James II in 1686. Gookin died on 19 March 1686/7, and was buried in the Old Cambridge Burying Ground, the town's main burial site opposite Harvard's Johnson gate. His table tomb is topped with a heart-shaped inset, probably the work of the Old Boston Stone Cutter, which is very similar to the one for Thomas Savage in King's Chapel Burying Ground, Boston.

It mainly inhabits small rivers and streams of the northern central USA, up into Canada. The adults inhabit faster, rocky pools of rivers. Range The hornyhead chub ranges from Wyoming, North Dakota, and South Dakota, east to the Hudson River drainage and south to Oklahoma. In South Dakota, the hornyhead chub is at the western edge of its range. Hornyhead chubs have been found in several water bodies in the Minnesota River Basin including the north and south forks of the Yellowbank River, Monigan Creek, Cobb Creek, Whetstone Creek, the North Fork of Whetstone Creek and Gary Creek in Roberts, Grant and Deuel Counties, as well as in Big Stone Lake in Grant County. In 1952, hornyhead chubs were documented to occur in the Big Sioux River drainage, but the exact location is unknown. The hornyhead chub has not been documented in the Big Sioux River drainage since the finding in 1952, and is likely extirpated from this watershed. They are also found in the Mississippi River basin, Red River drainage, Ohio River and lower Kentucky River systems. They can be found from New York west into the Dakotas with isolated populations in the Platte and Colorado River Systems, and north from Manitoba and south into Kentucky. Description The Hornyhead chub is moderate in size and slightly subterminal with an inconspicuous barbel in corner of mouth. This fish has no teeth. A body pattern of a back olive brown in color, with its sides having silvery color, and a belly of white. It also has a dark lateral stripe and a spot at the base of the tail, which is faint or absent in some adults. Fins contain decorative markings. Its body shape is fusiform and robust, round in cross-section. Typical adult size is 100–150 mm TL (4–6 in), with a maximum of about 225 mm (9 in). It has a forked tail and a single relatively short dorsal fin with 8 rays and without spines. Its pelvic fins are abdominal and has no adipose fin. Lastly, its anal fin with 7 rays has no spines. Its distinguishing characteristics are its moderately slightly subterminal mouth, and its defining inconspicuous barbel in the corner of its mouth. It also uniquely has 38-48 lateral line scales and a dark lateral stripe and caudal spot. Breeding adults have numerous large pointed tubercles on the top of their heads, smaller tubercles on their pectoral fins and a red or orange spot on the upper opercle behind their eyes. However juveniles look similar to adults, but have more obvious lateral stripes and caudal spots, and their tails are typically more reddish than the adult's tail. Adults can grow to 11 cm or more, and males commonly grow tubercles on their head during spawning season. Habitat The hornyhead chub is found in rocky pools and runs of creeks and small to medium-sized rivers. The hornyhead chub inhabits riffle/pool sections of small streams to medium- sized rivers. Although they are occasionally found in dark-water streams, they are more commonly found in clear-water streams. Presence is inversely related to turbidity. Vegetation does not necessarily have an effect on abundance of adults, however, the young use vegetation extensively for cover and are found in higher concentrations in these areas, at least for the first several weeks to one month of life. This species is commonly found in water depths of 2 – 6 feet (60 – 181 cm).http://www.seagrant.umn.edu/downloads/redtail_technical.pdf Life history and reproduction Hornyhead chubs spawn from May through June. They become sexually mature at 2 to 3 years of age. Males build a cup shaped depression that they build up with pebbles that can be as large as 1–3 feet across and 6-8 inches high. Eggs and sperm are deposited in depressions in the nests and covered with gravel. Males defend the nest mounds from other N. biguttatus males but not other species. Other species take advantage of this defense and spawn in the nest mounds. The result of this is sometimes accidental hybridization. The same male may spawn with several females. Diet The hornyhead chub is a visual feeder that is active primarily during daylight. A variety of plant and animal food items are commonly reported for hornyhead chubs. Animal food items for the young include: rotifers, cladocerans, copepods, chironomids, and aquatic insect larvae. Older hornyhead chubs are known to consume: clams, snails, crayfish, worms, aquatic insect larvae, and fish. Importance to humans Due to the fact that smallmouth bass, northern pike, and rock bass are thought to prey on the hornyhead chub, this type of minnow is often used as bait during fishing expeditions. Conservation status Globally, the status of the hornyhead chub is secure, but it is considered Critically Imperiled in Wyoming, Kansas, and Pennsylvania, and Possibly or Presumed Extirpated in Colorado and Nebraska. Currently, the National Heritage Program has assigned the hornyhead chub a global ranking of G5 suggesting that the species’ existence is globally secure and of least concern (LC).

He joined the CICM Missionaries, and was ordained priest. As a seminarian in Belgium he studied Chinese, which he came to know well; he also began to learn Mongolian using Isaac Jacob Schmidt’s Grammatik der mongolischen Sprache (St. Petersburg, 1831) and a Mongolian New Testament. He served as a missionary in the town of Boro Balγasu in the southern Ordos region from 1906-1925. His early work concentrated on Ordos Mongolian, with studies of phonology and the compilation of a dictionary. He also translated Catholic works from Chinese into Mongolian. The Monguor language formed another field of study. From 1925-1948 he lived in Beijing, where he devoted himself primarily to scholarship. In 1948 he moved to the United States, where he lived until his retirement to Belgium in 1965. Died in Tienen. His Mongol name was Tiyen Baγsi or Nom-un Baγsi Tiyen, deriving from his Chinese name Tian Qingbo (田清波). In addition to linguistics he worked on ethnography and folklore. In 1926 he began work on an analysis of the Secret History of the Mongols. Overall, Mostaert seems to have had the most extensive command of Mongol of any twentieth century Western scholar, derived from his decades living among the Ordos Mongols as a pastor. Nicholas Poppe called him “…the most outstanding scholar in the field of Mongolian studies.”Cited in Igor de Rachewiltz, “Father Antoine Mostaert’s Contribution to the Study of The Secret History of the Mongols and the Hua-I I-Yü,” in Antoine Mostaert, vol. 1, p. 93. Mostaert was particularly prolific as a consultant aiding other scholars, both Chinese and Western, and his scholarly impact cannot be judged solely from his formal publications. His main disciple was Henry Serruys, who has worked extensively on the history of Mongol-Ming relations. The private library and papers of A.

The Embarkation for Cythera (\\"L'embarquement pour Cythère\\") is a painting by the French painter Jean-Antoine Watteau. It is also known as Voyage to Cythera and Pilgrimage to the Isle of Cythera. Watteau submitted this work to the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture as his reception piece in 1717. The painting is now in the Louvre in Paris. A second version of the work, sometimes called Pilgrimage to Cythera to distinguish it, was painted by Watteau about 1718 or 1719 and is in the Charlottenburg Palace, Berlin. Subject Pilgrimage to Cythera is an embellished repetition of Watteau's earlier painting, and demonstrates the frivolity and sensuousness of Rococo painting. (c. 1718-19, Berlin) The painting portrays a \\"fête galante\\"; an amorous celebration or party enjoyed by the aristocracy of France during the Régence after the death of Louis XIV, which is generally seen as a period of dissipation and pleasure, and peace, after the sombre last years of the previous reign. The work celebrates love, with many cupids flying around the couples and pushing them closer together, as well as the statue of Venus (the goddess of sexual love). There are three pairs of lovers in the foreground. While the couple on the right by the statue are still engaged in their passionate tryst, another couple rises to follow a third pair down the hill, although the woman of the third pair glances back fondly at the goddess’s sacred grove. At the foot of the hill, several more happy couples are preparing to board the golden boat at the left. With its light and wispy brushstrokes, the hazy landscape in the background does not give to any clues about the season, or whether it is dawn or dusk. It has often been noted that, despite the title, the people on the island seem to be leaving rather than arriving, especially since they have already paired up. Many art historians have come up with a variety of interpretations of the allegory of the voyage to the island of love. Watteau himself purposely did not give an answer. In the ancient world, Cythera, one of the Greek islands, was thought to be the birthplace of Venus, goddess of love. Thus, the island became sacred to the goddess and love. However, the subject of Cythera may have been inspired by certain 17th century operas or an illustration of a minor play. In Florent Carton Dancourt's Les Trois Cousines (The Three Cousins), a girl dressed as a pilgrim steps out from the chorus line and invites the audience to join her on a voyage to the island, where everyone will meet their ideal partner. History It was around 1717 that Watteau painted his first, more literal version of the theme, which nonetheless bears a compositional similarity to the Louvre painting. This work is now in the Städtische Galerie im Städelschen Kunstinstitut, Frankfurt-am-Main. When Watteau was accepted as a member of the Academy in 1714, he was expected to present the customary reception piece. Although he was given unusual freedom in choosing a subject for his painting, his failure to submit a work brought several reprimands. Meanwhile, Watteau worked on numerous private commissions that his rising reputation brought him. Finally, in January 1717, the Academy called Watteau to task, and in August of that year he presented his painting, which had been painted quickly in the preceding eight months. Once submitted, the painting caused the Academy to invent a new classification for it, since the subject was so striking and new. This resulted in the fête galantes (elegant fêtes or outdoor entertainments), a genre subsequently practiced by imitators of Watteau, such as Jean-Baptiste Pater and Nicolas Lancret. While the creation of the new category acknowledged Watteau as the originator of the genre, it also prevented him being recognised as history painter, the highest class of painter, and the only one from which the academy's professors were drawn. Charles-Antoine Coypel, the son of its then director, later said: \\"The charming paintings of this gracious painter would be a bad guide for whoever wished to paint the Acts of the Apostles.\\"Humphrey Wine and Annie Scottez-De Wambrechies. \\"Watteau\\" in Grove Art Online. oxfordartonline.com Oxford University Press. Retrieved 8 February 2014. Popularity In years after Watteau’s death, his art fell out of fashion. During the French Revolution, some eighty years after the work was painted, his depictions of lavishly set pastoral escapades were associated with the old days of the monarchy and a frivolous aristocracy. This particular piece, which had entered the collection of the Louvre in 1795, was used by art students for target practice; an account by Pierre Bergeret (1782–1863) describes the drawing students throwing bread pellets at it. In the early 19th century the curator at the Louvre was forced to place it in storage until 1816 in order to protect the painting from angry protesters. It was not until the 1830s that Watteau and the Rococo returned into fashion. Derivative works In 1904 Claude Debussy wrote a piece for solo piano titled \\"L'Isle Joyeuse\\", which may have been inspired by the painting; the colorful and brilliant piano writing depicts the ecstasy of the lovers. Four decades later, Debussy's compatriot Francis Poulenc wrote a lively piece for two pianos which took the name of the painting for its title, \\"L'Embarquement pour Cythere\\".

Four people were charged with the murders, three were hanged, and one was pardoned after giving information about the murders and information which allowed the other members of the group to be convicted. The group of four have been named the Burgess Gang after the leader Richard Burgess. The gang was composed of Richard Burgess, Joseph Thomas Sullivan, Philip Levy, and Thomas Kelly (birth name Thomas Noon). The victims were James Battle, George Dudley, John Kempthorne, James de Pontius, and Felix Mathieu. The Burgess Gang Also known as the Burgess-Kelly Gang. The initial members of the gang were Richard Burgess and Thomas Kelly. The leader of the gang was Richard Burgess, originally known as Richard Hill. Burgess was born in London on 14 February 1829. He lived with his mother and was never sure of his biological father as he was born illegitimate. Burgess in his early teens was seduced by the pick pocketing and robbery trade. He was arrested several times and was sentenced to transportation to New South Wales, Australia in 1847. He preyed on gold miners in Australia and was arrested a number of times. Burgess then followed the gold rush to New Zealand. Burgess landed in Dunedin, New Zealand on 6 June 1862. In Otago he joined up with Thomas Noon later known as Thomas Kelly whom he had already met in jail in Australia. Richard Burgess and Thomas Kelly were arrested in 1862 and sentenced to 3.5 years in Dunedin Gaol. Released from the Dunedin Gaol in September 1865 Burgess and Kelly were escorted to the border of the Otago province and made their way to Hokitika. In Hokitika they met Sullivan. Sullivan had a wife and children in Melbourne, Australia. They became partners in crime. Burgess had previous business with Philip Levy in Australia and New Zealand. In Greymouth Burgess and Levy became closer as they did more deals. The group set sail to Nelson and landed on 6 June 1866 with the objective to rob several banks in the area, however for various reasons these goals were abandoned. The gang ended up in a nearby village called Canvastown which is east of Nelson and was reached through the Maungatapu track which was the only route. The murders The epitaph on the Maungatapu Monument The murders occurred on 12 and 13 June 1866. A few days before, Levy had learned from locals that four businessmen were moving all their gold and money to the bank in Nelson. The four businessmen all knew each other and planned to make the journey together on 12 June. The gang planned to hold up the group with a large number of weapons so they would surrender without resistance, and then rob and kill them. They estimated that the group could have a total of 1000 pounds of money and gold. The gang stationed themselves on a suitable site along the Maungatapu track, a place now called Murderers' Rock. On 12 June, James Battle, a flax grower, had terminated his employment and was returning to Nelson via the Maungatapu track. At first the gang let him pass, but later caught up to Battle and robbed him of three pounds and 16 shillings; afterward they strangled him and buried him in a shallow grave. The following day at approximately 1:00PM, Dudley, Kempthorne, de Pontius, and Mathieu (accompanied by a horse with a pack) were held up by the gang. The victims immediately surrendered and were bound and moved off the track. After they were robbed (the winnings were only 80 pounds per gang member), they were all killed, first Dudley, by strangulation. Kempthorne was shot along with de Pontius. Mathieu was shot, then stabbed, then shot again. Three of the bodies were hidden, but that of de Pontius was covered with rocks: if the bodies were ever found, they reasoned, de Pontius would be missing and the first conclusion would be that de Pontius committed the crime. The gang then shot the horse through the head and let the animal slide down off a bank into vegetation. Other belongings such as clothes were burnt in a derelict house, and the gang returned to Nelson that night. The arrest Joseph Sullivan, 1874 engraving Unknown to the gang a friend of the victims, Heinrich Moller was planning to meet the Mathieu party in Nelson to return the horse to Canvastown, however when Moller did not see or catch up on the group on the track or in Nelson that evening, he asked other friends and hotels if they had seen the group. Moller had to return to Canvastown after several days of waiting, and informed the locals of his story. George Jevis rode to Nelson immediately to inform the police, as his thoughts dwelled on foul play. On 18 June the investigation began, and in the evening Levy was arrested. 19 June Burgess, Sullivan, and Kelly were all arrested for suspicion of murder. The police were able to come to this conclusion because witnesses had seen the gang arrive in Nelson with little money, Levy paid all fees. After the gang returned to Nelson they drank and gambled with little restraint. 20 June the horse was found along with a shotgun by the search party. On the 28th Sullivan made a full statement after seeing a reward from the administration of justice. The reward was a free pardon as an accomplice and 200 pounds. After this information, on the 29th the bodies of the Mathieu group were found. Sullivan also informed the police of Battle's murder, until this time Battle's absence had not been reported. On 3 July Battle's body was found. The victims were buried in Wakapuaka Cemetery in a mass grave. The funeral was the largest in Nelson ever. On 9 August Burgess gave a confession which admitted his own guilt and tried to incriminate Sullivan and attempted to free Levy and Kelly of the charges. The trial The trial started on 12 September and ended on 18 September. The jury found Burgess, Levy, and Kelly guilty of murder and sentenced to death by hanging. Sullivan was given immunity after giving information. A second trial was started on 18 September which tried Sullivan for the murder of James Battle. This was very unusual, Sullivan gave the information which led to Battle's murder being discovered. Sullivan was not granted immunity for this separate crime. Sullivan was found guilty of murder and also sentenced to death by hanging. Two weeks later Sullivan's death sentence was withdrawn to a life sentence of imprisonment. The execution Nelson had never had a murder case before this case. Gallows were specially constructed which allowed three men to be hanged simultaneously. A hangman was summoned from Wellington. 5 October was the date of execution. At approximately 8:30 am Burgess, Levy, and Kelly were hanged. Burgess and Levy died instantly, however Kelly choked. Death masks were made of heads of the convicted for the pseudoscience of phrenology. It is unknown what occurred with the bodies, and there are many urban legends about the burial of the three bodies.http://www.theprow.org.nz/the-execution-of-the-maungatapu-murderers/ Fate of Sullivan Sullivan shipped to Dunedin where he served seven years of his life sentence. A conditional pardon was granted where he was to leave New Zealand and never return. He was also unable to go to any Australian colonies. Sullivan did travel to Melbourne to see his wife and children. Sullivan was caught by the authorities. What happened next is a mystery. There is evidence of Sullivan's death in Auckland on 16 September 1921. This is debated.

As “surfing’s premier historian and leading expert on Hawaiian surfing going back to the 17th century” and “the intellectual mentor, driving force, and international public face” of the Hokulea project, he played a key role in the Hawaiian Renaissance following his construction of the Hokulea precursor Nalehia in the 1960s and his co-founding of the Polynesian Voyaging Society in the 1970s. Biography The son of a United States Navy pilot, Ben Finney was born in 1933 and grew up in San Diego, California. He earned his B.A. in history, economics, and anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley in 1955. In 1958, after serving in the U.S. Navy and working in the steel and aerospace industries, he went to Hawaii, where he earned his M.A. in anthropology at the University of Hawaii in 1959. His master's degree thesis, “Hawaiian Surfing: a Study of Cultural Change”, became the basis for Surfing: The Sport of Hawaiian Kings, a book that Finney co-authored with James D. Houston in 1966. Finney earned his Ph.D. in anthropology at Harvard University in 1964. Finney held faculty appointments at the University of California, Santa Barbara, the Australian National University, the University of French Polynesia, and the International Space University. From 1970 through 2000 he was a professor of anthropology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his courses included Human Adaptation to the Sea and Human Adaptation to Living in Space. From 1994 through 2003 he was the co-chair of the department of Space and Society at the International Space University. In the 1990s, Finney was a National Research Council Associate with the SETI project at NASA Ames Research Center and involved in the Sandia National Laboratories planning and implementation of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant for the disposal of nuclear waste. He was on the panel of experts for the 1998 PBS program Wayfinders: A Pacific Odyssey. During 2004-2006 he was a curator of the Vaka Moana canoe voyaging exhibit at the Auckland Museum in New Zealand. He was the featured guest speaker at the 2007 National Conference for Educational Robotics. He later served as a professor at University of Hawaii at Manoa, and also as a distinguished research associate of the Bishop Museum. He and his wife, Mila, lived most of the year in Hawaii. Finney died on May 23, 2017 at the age of 83.http://khon2.com/2017/05/23/polynesian-voyaging- society-co-founder-ben-finney-dies-at-83/ Polynesian voyaging When Ben Finney was a University of Hawaii graduate student in 1958, working toward his master of arts degree and writing his dissertation on surfing, scholars were not yet in agreement that any canoe voyages over great distances on the Pacific Ocean had been intentional. The prevailing view was exemplified by a New Zealand historian with a low opinion of Polynesian navigation methods and canoes, Andrew Sharp, who believed that such voyages could only have been accidental. Finney did not agree with this view and became determined to disprove it. He built the first 40-feet-long replica of a Polynesian sailing canoe while he was teaching at University of California, Santa Barbara in the 1960s. When it was finished, he shipped it to Hawaii, where ancient Hawaii scholar Mary Kawena Pukui named it Nalehia, which in the Hawaiian language means The Skilled Ones, because of the grace with which its twin hulls rode the sea. In 1973, Finney co-founded the Polynesian Voyaging Society with artist Herb Kawainui Kane and sailor Charles Tommy Holmes. Within three years, they had designed, built, and sailed the Hōkūleʻa on its first historic voyage from Hawaii to Tahiti with a crew led by captain Kawika Kapahulehua and navigator Mau Piailug.

She appeared in about 40 films and 10 TV episodes in a career lasting from 1943 to 1968. Early work Owens moved to England in 1933 with her parents (her Welsh father Arthur Owens was later to become an MI5 double agent), and ten years later, at age 18, she made her motion-picture debut in the musical comedy Miss London Ltd. The following year, she had a small role in Harold French's social satire English Without Tears. Her career continued in this manner for a few years, Owens getting ever-larger roles in movies. Her career received a boost when she was seen by a 20th Century Fox executive while performing in a stage production of Sabrina Fair and was offered a screen test. The result was a contract with the studio and a move to Hollywood. Her first American film was Island in the Sun (1957), followed by No Down Payment, both for Fox, after which Owens was loaned out to Warner Bros. to appear in the critically acclaimed drama Sayonara (1957). Success in The Fly Owens spent the rest of 1957 working mostly on loan- out, but it was a successful Fox production that secured her best known role—as Hélène Delambre, the wife of scientist André Delambre in The Fly (1958). Owens carried much of that horror film's narrative, which was largely presented in flashback from her character's point of view.Pfeiffer, Lee. \\"The Fly: Film By Neumann (1958)\\", Encyclopædia Britannica, Chicago, Illinois, 2019. Retrieved April 15, 2019. None of Owens' subsequent films ever attained the same level of success as The Fly. She co-starred in the 1960 war film Hell to Eternity, then in 1961 appeared in the threadbare, backlot POW/jungle chase drama Seven Women from Hell. Owens made occasional television appearances, on series such as Perry Mason and Burke's Law, but these were relatively infrequent. Owens starred in the 1959 episode \\"The Crystal Trench\\" of the series Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Retirement By 1965, Owens was working in Black Spurs, a B-Western produced by A.C. Lyles, who was renowned for using older stars in that genre. She retired from feature films in 1968 after portraying the love interest in the low-budget espionage thriller The Destructors. Later that same year, she made her last professional appearance in a televised episode of Lassie. Personal life Owens was married and divorced three times.

Rasmussen, also known as Bill Rasmussen (born 1932) is an American sports director, and one of the founders of ESPN, along with Scott Rasmussen and Ed Egan. Rasmussen served as the first president and CEO of ESPN. ESPN was founded on July 14, 1978, and was launched on September 7, 1979. Early life Bill Rasmussen was born in Chicago, Illinois where he attended Gage Park High School. He received a scholarship to attend DePauw University in Indiana, where he met his future wife Mickey. After college, he was a supply officer in the US Air Force. He played baseball (as third baseman) with the hopes of going pro. Parts he procured for the Air Force were used in F-86 and F-89 fighter jets, as well as on Mercury space capsules. He then attended Rutgers University to get his MBA. His son Scott was born in 1956, the year he was discharged from the military.ESPN: The Uncensored History, by Michael Freeman Early career Rasmussen's career in the media began in western Massachusetts's Pioneer Valley, at radio station WTTT (1430 AM) in Amherst in 1963. In 1965, he moved south to Springfield, working for both of the city's television stations. First, he worked at WHYN (today's WGGB, channel 40), then WWLP (channel 22), where he spent eight years as a sports director, then two as a news director. In 1974 he moved south to Hartford, Connecticut to join the New England Whalers of the World Hockey Association as their communications director. At the conclusion of the 1977–78 season, Rasmussen was fired by the Whalers. Thus began the pursuit of ESPN, incorporating the fledgling network on July 14, 1978.  ESPN  ESPN, originally called Entertainment and Sports Programming, was incorporated on July 14, 1978. It began broadcasting fourteen months later, at 7 p.m. on September 7, 1979. ESPN wound up being headquartered in Bristol, Connecticut. Rasmussen paid $18,000 for the first acre of ESPN's campus. =Moving On= Getty Oil purchased 85% of ESPN and left 15% of the enterprise to be split. By July 18, 1979, before launch, the investors decided to remove Rasmussen from power. His salary and responsibilities were cut. Just prior to the launch of ESPN, according to the book Those Guys Have All the Fun: Inside the World of ESPN Stuart Evey claimed \\"I made Bill Chairman, but in no way did I want to give him any responsibility!\\" \\"Having Bill Rasmussen play a significant role was just not part of the deal.\\" Rasmussen, the one who had the idea for ESPN, stepped back from day-to-day business, having less contact with ESPN until mid 1999. Rasmussen and ESPN \\"made amends\\" in 1999 when then-president George Bodenheimer reached out to the founder for the network's 20th anniversary. On September 30, 1980, ESPN officials announced that Bill Rasmussen was leaving the company by agreement. = The Sale = The New York Times reported in 1984 that ABC purchased controlling interest in ESPN by buying out Getty Oil's position. At the time of the Getty Oil buy out, ABC in turn bought out the Rasmussen Families 15% for $6,000,000. Rasmussen had to split the $6,000,000 with numerous other investors and funders such as his brother Don Rasmussen, with Bill Rasmussen ending up with an estimated $1.2 million and a little over $740,000 after taxes. George Bodenheimer, then president of ESPN, recognized Rasmussen in October 2005 and dedicated a plaque and flag pole in Rasmussen's honor. Post ESPN =Family Business = The all sports radio network Enterprise Radio Network was founded in January 1981 by Scott Rasmussen, the son of Bill Rasmussen, and was shuttered by September 1981. The network broadcast sports reports twice an hour and did live phone in sports talk from 6 pm to 8 am Eastern Time seven days a week. The project failed, with employees not getting paid all wages they were due. Bill Rasmussen was sued by the labor department along with Scott for allegedly violating the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. =Other Business= Rasmussen became involved in plans to build a 12,000-seat golf stadium in Naples, Florida. The project was rife with corruption, with the Naples Daily News describing it as the \\"biggest public corruption scandal in local history\\". Rasmussen became a subject of the criminal investigations surrounding the project and pled guilty to two misdemeanor cases of fraud in a plea deal that reduced the charges against him in exchange for his cooperation in the corruption case against the public officials. In July 2019, Rasmussen disclosed that he has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.

He was by Salieri (USA) out of Biscarina (Biscay- Forina). Background A huge grey gelding, Schillaci was a $70,000 purchase at the 1990 yearling sales, and was named after Salvatore Schillaci, who was the leading goal scorer at the 1990 World Cup. In something of a fashion at the time, another grey gelding, Baggio, was named after one of Schillaci's teammates, Roberto Baggio, and was a consistent stakes performer in Brisbane.Baggio's race record Racing career Schillaci was unraced at two, and made his debut in a Kyneton maiden on 22 October 1991, where he defeated Mavournae, who, like Schillaci, would go on to win the Rubiton Stakes. Schillaci was spelled after two more starts, which produced a win in fast time at Sandown in late-November. In the new year, Schillaci was catapulted straight into Group One company, and won the Lightning Stakes, the Oakleigh Plate, and the Newmarket Handicap in successive starts. In winning these races, the grey had become a triple-Group One winner after just six starts, and only the second horse, after Placid Ark in 1987, to complete the treble. Schillaci was then taken to Sydney, where he was beaten on protest by Alishan in the Canterbury Stakes, and won his fourth Group One race, The Galaxy. In Brisbane, he added the QTC Cup, and carried the big weight of 56.5 kilograms when unplaced behind Rough Habit in the Stradbroke Handicap. At four, Schillaci won a further six races, including Group One wins in the Lightning, the Futurity, and the George Ryder Stakes. He failed to win in five starts at five, but won three more races at six. According to trainer Lee Freedman, Schillaci was 'never quite right' as an older horse,Trainer's web site but made a winning comeback in the Caulfield Sprint, on Cup day, and won his final Group One race in the autumn's Futurity Stakes. Retirement After his final start - a second in the Stradbroke Handicap - Schillaci was retired to a property near Seymour.

Its brands include Bakugan, Gund, Etch A Sketch, Erector Set by Meccano, Air Hogs, PAW Patrol, Aquadoodle, Tech Deck, Hatchimals, and Zoomer.http://www.toyawards.org/Events2/TOTY_Awards/2016_TOTY_Winners.aspx Spin Master employs over 1,600 people globally with offices in Canada, United States, Mexico, France, Italy, United Kingdom, Slovakia, Poland, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Vietnam, and Australia. Since 2002, Spin Master has received 92 TIA Toy of The Year (TOTY) nominations with 28 wins across a variety of product categories, including 13 TOTY nominations for Innovative Toy of the Year, more than any other toy company.http://www.toyawards.org History Three college friends from Western Ivey Business School, Ronnen Harary, Anton Rabie and Ben Varadi, founded Spin Master with $10,000 in Toronto in 1994. The company's first product, Earth Buddies, was a small head made out of Kmart pantyhoses and grass seeds, which grew \\"hair\\" when watered. The Earth Buddy went on to sell over 26,000 units. Spin Master's first major success came in 1998 with the launch of the Air Hogs brand, and its first item, the Sky Shark. Developed from the prototype provided by inventors John Dixon and Peter Manning, the Sky Shark was a foam plane that used compressed air to enable outdoor flight. Product development took over two years and more than $500,000, but ended up generating $103 million in revenue over the next few years. The Sky Shark put Spin Master on the map, becoming one of the most popular toys in the world and earning them a slot on daytime television Regis and Kathie Lee alongside other international press. The company, which had grown to 28 employees by 1999, told the LA Times they were already “assessing 1,000 inventions a year.” They’d moved their manufacturing supply chain to Hong Kong in 1998 and were ready to rise as a new name in the toy industry. The company scored another success in 1999, with Flix Trix Finger Bikes, a string of 1/2 inch replicas of BMX bikes. In 2003, the company made its first corporate acquisition buying Bounce ‘Round, a company that created scaled down versions of the inflatable bouncy castles. Over the next handful of years, Spin Master opened offices in the U.S., Japan and Western Europe. In 2008, Spin Master launched the Bakugan Battle Brawlers franchise, a card game developed in conjunction with Sega Toys, featured plastic balls which burst open to reveal anime-style characters. Bakugan reached almost $1 billion in yearly sales. Under Harary's leadership, Spin Master Entertainment launched with Bakugan Battle Brawlers the animated action adventure television series under the direction of Mitsuo Hashimoto. To date, Spin Master Entertainment has developed six television series with over 400 cumulative episodes. Abby Hatcher, Fuzzly Catcher, Spin Master's newest animated preschool series debut on Nickelodeon on January 2019 in the U.S. The show centers on Abby and her new friends the Fuzzlies, who are amazing and quirky creatures that live in her family's hotel. Together with her best Fuzzly friend Bozzly, Abby goes on wild adventures to fix Fuzzly mishaps and help them in any way she can. In August 2013, Spin Master acquired the Erector Set by Meccano construction set line. In June 2015, Spin Master entered into an agreement to acquire Cardinal Industries, a 60-year-old game and puzzles company. The purchase made Spin Master the second largest games company in the U.S. A month after announcing it was buying Cardinal, Spin Master made its initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In January 2016 Spin Master purchased the library of board games owned by Editrice Giochi SRL, one of the oldest privately held toy game companies in Italy. In February 2016, Spin Master bought the Etch A Sketch and Doodle Sketch brands from The Ohio Art Company for an undisclosed price. In April 2016, Spin Master purchased digital toy makers Toca Boca and Sago Mini from the Bonnier Group of Sweden. In August 2016 Spin Master diversified into the water and outdoor sports category through the acquisition of Swimways corporation. In 2017, Spin Master acquired Marbles, a firm known for creating games, gifts and gadgets and the maker of Otrio; Aerobie, a leading producer of outdoor flying disks and sports toys; and Perplexus, a 3D ball-in-a-maze Spin Master had been distributing since 2013. In March 2018, Spin Master acquired the 120 year old stuffed toy brand Gund. Spin Master is now a $1.5 billion (sales) company, which employs over 1,600 people in 16 countries.

Lee Thompson from a screenplay originally written by William Roberts. The film stars Charles Bronson in the lead role with a supporting cast that includes Lisa Eilbacher, Andrew Stevens, Gene Davis, Geoffrey Lewis, and Wilford Brimley. 10 to Midnight was released by City Films, a subsidiary of Cannon Films, to American cinemas on March 11, 1983. Plot Warren Stacy (Gene Davis) is a young office equipment repairman who kills women after they reject his sexual advances. His attempts at flirting are always seen as \\"creepy\\" by women, resulting in frequent rejections.Knight (2008), p. 49-51 His first victim is Betty (June Gilbert), an office worker of his acquaintance. He tracks her down to a wooded area, and observes her having sex with her boyfriend. He ambushes the couple, kills the boyfriend and then gives chase to the naked woman. He catches her and stabs her to death.Knight (2008), p. 49-51 Two Los Angeles police detectives, Leo Kessler (Charles Bronson) and Paul McAnn (Andrew Stevens), investigate his murders. Kessler is a seasoned veteran of the force, while McAnn is considerably younger.Knight (2008), p. 49-51 Stacy avoids prosecution by constructing sound alibis and assaulting his victims while naked except for a pair of latex gloves to hide fingerprints, thus minimizing evidence. Laurie Kessler (Lisa Eilbacher) is the only daughter of Leo and an acquaintance to some of the victims. A student nurse herself, she becomes a target for the killer.Knight (2008), p. 49-51 McAnn refuses to go along when Kessler plants evidence in order to frame the suspect. Stacy goes on another rampage, killing three nursing students who are friends with Kessler's daughter. He is eventually caught, stark naked in the street. Stacy boasts how he will say all the things that will \\"prove\\" that he is crazy: he hears voices ordering him to do things, etc., so that one day, he will be back on the street and Kessler, as well as the \\"whole fucking world,\\" will hear from him again. Kessler replies, \\"No, we won't.\\" He then shoots Stacy once in the forehead, executing him and leaving all other considerations aside. Kessler stands over the body, surrounded by police. Cast * Charles Bronson as Leo Kessler, a tough LAPD detective who pursues Stacy. * Lisa Eilbacher as Laurie Kessler, Leo's daughter. * Andrew Stevens as Paul McAnn, Leo's partner and best friend. * Gene Davis as Warren Stacy, a young psychopathic serial killer and office equipment repairman that rapes and murders young women after they reject him. * Geoffrey Lewis as Dave Dante * Wilford Brimley as Capt.

The intent was to portray the character in a way that the audience will feel no sympathy for him. The type of villain an audience wants to see go down.Knight (2008), p. 49-51 The film features strong violence as well as much \\"gratuitous nudity\\". It combines the two by having victims killed while naked or partially undressed.Knight (2008), p. 49-51 Production =Development= Producer Pancho Kohner had made a number of films with Charles Bronson and J. Lee Thompson. They purchased the film rights to the novel The Evil That Men Do (1978) by R. Lance Hill. Cannon Films chairman Menahem Golan wanted to market Bronson's next film project and the adaptation of the novel was going to be that project. But Kohner estimated the rights to the novel and the cost of the screenplay to be worth $200,000 dollars. Menahem refused to pay and the deal fell through.Talbot (2006), p. 76-77 However, Menahem still offered to market Bronson's next film project, just not based on that novel. He and Kohner had already arranged a visit to the Cannes Film Festival to promote The Evil That Men Do. He asked Kohner to come up with a new project and fresh title, and 10 to Midnight was the result of his brainstorm. At the Festival they promoted the project to potential buyers, as a film featuring action, danger, and revenge. But at this point, they really had no script for the suggested film. Back in Los Angeles, they went in search of a story of the film. A colleague of Kohner's, Lance Hool, suggested using the screenplay Bloody Sunday by William Roberts. They simply attached the already chosen title to that screenplay.Talbot (2006), p. 76-77 (The Evil That Men Do later ended up being financed by ITC Entertainment.) The name of killer Warren for Warren Stacy was based on Hollywood star Warren Beatty. Actor Gene Davis, who played Warren, said that director J. Lee Thompson pretty much left him alone to form his character, but told him \\"We don't want the role to be sympathetic...\\" presumably so as to make the ending have more impact. =Shooting= The music for 10 to Midnight was composed by Cannon Films mainstay Robert O. Ragland and the film was recorded by cinematographer Adam Greenberg. The film also features actor Robert F. Lyons and actress Kelly Preston (listed as Kelly Palzis) in smaller roles. Reception Heavy on violence, nudity, vulgar language and sexual situations, 10 to Midnight drew scathing reviews from film critics, including a \\"zero stars\\" rating from Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times who wrote, \\"I admired [Bronson's] strong, simple talent once. What is he doing in a garbage disposal like this?\\" The film did receive positive feedback from others, such as Ebert's colleague Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune and was a moderate financial success.CANNON'S BOX-OFFICE RESPECT SANDRA SALMANS, Special to the New York Times. 26 Apr 1983: D.1. The film has maintained a sizeable cult following through home video releases and cable TV showings. The film was often heavily edited for television broadcasts which displayed alternate scenes of Stacy and his victims in their underwear instead of being totally naked. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 33% based on 9 reviews, with an average rating of 3.71/10.

One was made in 1938 and the other in 1965. They are filled with contemporary articles used in the twentieth century way of life in the United States. The items are intended for people of the 7th millennium (~ year 6900) to receive for historical significance. The capsules are specially designed non-corrosive metal tubes 90 inches long and about nine inches in diameter. The tubes were made with electrical properties in mind that enhanced the characteristics of each tube's unique metal chemical make-up. Each were formulated to resist corrosion over time, rather than being allowed to waste away to dust. The capsules were buried fifty feet in the ground at Flushing Meadows Park near New York City and are positioned about ten feet apart. There were record books about these time capsules given to thousands of libraries, museums, and other depositories worldwide to preserve the knowledge that they exist. Included was the information that they shouldn't be opened before the seventh millennium and where they can be located. Duplicates of the contents of the objects held for these people of the future are currently held in a history museum of the United States.  Background  Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company prepared time capsules for two world's fairs. They are both buried 50 feet below Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, the site of the fairs. Time Capsule I was created for the 1939 New York World's Fair and Time Capsule II was created for the 1964 New York World's Fair. The second capsule is placed ten feet north of the first capsule. The capsules are filled with physical objects of that time period of social and scientific interest. They are to be opened at the same time in the year 6939. New York publicist George Edward Pendray was editor for Literary Digest when in 1936 he interviewed Thornwell Jacobs, organizer of Oglethorpe University's millennia-spanning time crypt of objects preserved for the people of 8113 AD. He then published an article about this in his October magazine. Westinghouse then took this concept and started developing in 1938 their Time Capsule of Cupaloy for the 1939 New York World's Fair. Construction The time capsules are bullet- shaped, measure in length, and have an exterior casing of about in diameter. Time Capsule I weighs about , while Time Capsule II weighs about . Time Capsule I was made of a non-ferrous alloy called Cupaloy, created especially for this project.Anderson, Brian. The Future Is Still Now: Inside Westinghouse's Time Capsule 1 . Motherboard.vice.com. April 30, 2016. Retrieved on October 17, 2016 Designed to resist corrosion for 5,000 years, the alloy was made of 99.4% copper, 0.5% chromium, and 0.1% silver. Westinghouse claims that Cupaloy has the same strength as steel, yet will resist most corrosion over thousands of years because it becomes an anode in electrolytic reactions, receiving deposits instead of wasting away like most iron-bearing metals. Time Capsule II was made of a stainless steel metal called Kromarc. Westinghouse Research Laboratories determined, with extensive chemical testing, that this new super-stainless steel alloy would resist corrosion, much like the alloy used for Time Capsule I. Kromarc is an alloy of iron, nickel, chromium, manganese, molybdenum, and trace amounts of other elements. The contents of the time capsules were sealed inside an insulated, airtight, glass envelope with an interior diameter of and a length of about . The interior of the glass envelope of Capsule I was filled with nitrogen. Capsule II, weighing 300 pounds, was filled with the inert gas argon. Capsule contents =1939 Time Capsule I= Among the 35 small, everyday items placed inside Time Capsule I were a fountain pen and an alphabet block set. Time Capsule I also contained 75 types of fabrics, metals, and plastics. Modern literature, contemporary art, and news events of the twentieth century were recorded on a microfilm \\"Micro-File\\" for placement in Time Capsule I; the \\"Micro-File\\" holds over ten million words and a thousand pictures, and has a small microscope for viewing. There are also instructions included on how to make both a large microfilm viewer and a motion picture projector for the newsreels. Time Capsule I Also included in the capsule were copies of Life magazine, a kewpie doll, one dollar in change, a pack of Camel cigarettes, a 15-minute RKO Pathe Pictures newsreel, a Lilly Daché hat, and millions of words of text put on microfilm rolls which included a Sears Roebuck catalog, a dictionary, and an almanac. A variety of seeds were placed in the time capsule including wheat, corn, oats, tobacco, cotton, flax, rice, soy beans, alfalfa, sugar beets, carrots, and barley. Organic items (e.g. seeds) were placed in sealed glass vials. Pendray supervised the items in the capsule that were selected to chronicle 20th-century life in the United States. During packaging of the contents, under the direction of representatives of the United States National Bureau of Standards, each object was examined to determine whether it could be expected to last 5,000 years. Pendray was sent a letter by anthropologist Clark David Wissler that he felt most things were well represented in a draft list of the items going into the time capsule, except perhaps that of a sewing machine and noteworthy ceremonies (i.e. religious, weddings). Rose Arnold Powell, best remembered to get Susan B. Anthony represented on Mount Rushmore, sent Pendray a telegraph requesting that he get an input from women's suffrage activist Carrie Chapman Catt. He added then the only pencil handwritten page in the capsule that listed items in it that were represented by 20th century women, such as culinary preparation tracts and women's exploits noted in World Almanacs and film. Care was taken to select items that are not interactive and do not decompose into harmful gases or acids.Westinghouse (1939), p. 16 Time Capsule I 1939 (left) and Time Capsule II of 1965 ^ Guest book pin Five categories of objects were placed inside Time Capsule I. * Small articles of common use * Textiles and materials * Essay in microfilm * RKO newsreel * Miscellaneous itemsComplete Contents List of 1939 Time Capsule New York Times archive.

Signers received tin pins, about across (roughly the size of an American fifty-cent piece), stating, My name is in the Westinghouse Time Capsule for the next 5,000 years. The book's pages were photographed onto acetate microfilm and the roll of film placed into the time capsule for the people of the seventieth century that open the capsule and find all the contents from the twentieth century. There were an estimated 750,000 signatures collected. The first one was that of United States President Lyndon B. Johnson. The signature of Pope Paul VI was among the signatures of notable people that signed the Westinghouse guest book. Book of Record The contents of Time Capsule I were recorded in a Book of Record of the Time Capsule of Cupaloy. The purpose of this book is to preserve knowledge of the existence of the time capsule for 5,000 years, and to provide assistance to the people of the year 6939 in locating and recovering it. More than 3000 copies of the book were distributed to museums, monasteries, and libraries worldwide.Westinghouse (1939), pp 11-13 In order to avoid confusion about the 1965 time capsule, a supplement announcing Time Capsule II was sent to the original 3,000 depositories of the 1938 edition. If present-day methods of determining time are lost, future generations will be able to calculate the age of the time capsules using astronomical data. In the year 1939, there were two eclipses of the moon, falling on the third of May and the twenty-eighth of October. There were also two eclipses of the sun, an annular eclipse on the nineteenth of April, the path of annular eclipse grazing the North Pole of the earth, and a total eclipse on the twelfth of October, the total path crossing near the South Pole. The heliocentric longitudes of the planets on the first of January at zero-hours Greenwich time were as follows: : Planet * Mercury * Venus * Earth * Mars * Jupiter * Saturn * Uranus * Neptune * Pluto degrees : 175 : 124 : 99 : 192 : 339 : 17 : 46 : 171 : 120 minutes : 55 : 43 : 40 : 4 : 12 : 30 : 23 : 32 : 17 seconds : 42 : 32 : 29 : 2 : 22 : 45 : 31 : 3 : 0 The mean position of the North Star Polaris (Alpha Ursae Minoris) on the first of January was Right Ascension, 1 hour, 41 minutes, 59 seconds; North Polar distance, 1 degree, 1 minute, and 33.8 seconds. Astronomers of the early twentieth century determined that such a combination of astronomical events is unlikely to recur for many thousands of years. It is thought that this information will allow people of the future to determine the number of years that have elapsed since the capsule was buried by computing backward from their time. Location of the two time capsules 1939 Westinghouse exhibit Time Capsule I was lowered at noon on September 23, 1938, the precise moment of the Autumnal Equinox. The latitude and longitude coordinates of its burying place, as determined by the U.S. National Geodetic Survey, was recorded in the Book of Record as within . The time capsule will likely move vertically or horizontally for geological reasons, so an alternate electromagnetic field method was provided. This method involves constructing a loop of wire in diameter and putting an alternating current (between 1,000 and 5,000 hertz) through it with a power of at least 200 watts. A secondary loop of wire, about in diameter, will detect a \\"distortion field\\", thus indicating the exact location of the two metal alloy time capsules, assuming no other large metal objects are in the vicinity. At the close of the 1965 World's Fair, a seven- ton \\"permanent sentinel\\" granite monument, made by the Rock of Ages Corporation, was installed. The shaft was filled using pitch, concrete and earth, and the monument placed to mark the position where the two time capsules are buried.Time capsule II deposited for 5,000 years at world's fair.

Overview The Bhotia is found in the Himalayan foothills from Kashmir to Eastern Nepal. The breed is primarily used as a livestock guardian, protecting flocks of yak and sheep from various predators, and as a property guard, unusually for a livestock guardian the breed is also used to assist with herding. In certain parts of Tehri Garhwal the Bhotia is also used to assist in hunting. The Bhotia is very closely related to the slightly larger Tibetan mastiff. The breed's double coat is typically harsh and thick and they are usually black and tan or solid black with some white markings on their toes, chest and neck, they have small drooped ears and heavily plumed tail that is curled over their back. There are slightly distinct sub-varieties of the breed found in the Kumaon hills and Chamba; the former, which is known as the Cypro Kukur or Kumaon mastiff, is brindle, rich golden brown or black in colour, the latter is smaller than most of the breed and resemble a larger, longer haired black Labrador. In 2005 the Bhotia was one of four Indian dog breeds featured on a set of postage stamps released by the Indian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology to celebrate the country's canine heritage.

It came into National news as a result of the Whitewater investigations. The project was a lot where Jim McDougal hoped to build a microbrewery, shopping center, a trailer park and other future projects in 1985. The land was scrub pine forest that had failed already as an industrial development. The sales price was $1.75 million. State regulations prohibited Jim McDougal from investing more than 6% of his Madison Guaranty S&L; assets. So, he put in $600,000 of Madison money and then for the difference had Seth Ward put in the remaining $1.15 million. This money Ward borrowed from Madison Guaranty on non-recourse, no personal obligation to repay. If federal regulators found out, McDougal's S&L; could be shut down, since it had already been operating under orders to correct its lending practices.PBS, Castle Grande Deal, by Rick Youngcnn.com, Meanwhile, Back In Arkansas..., By Eric PooleyHillary Clinton and the Whitewater Controversy: A Close-Up, By David Maraniss and Susan Schmidt, Washington Post Staff Writers, Sunday, June 2, 1996; Page A01  Seth Ward  Seth Ward, an Arkansas businessman and Webster Hubbell's father-in-law, was hired by Jim McDougal to assist in land acquisition for the Castle Grande project.Final Report of the Independent Counsel in Re--Madison Guaranty Savings, By Robert W. Ray, page 148 Hillary Clinton, a partner with the Rose Law Firm, worked with Ward on certain legal details of the project known as Industrial Development Corporation (IDC). Webster Hubbell was also a partner at the Rose Law Firm. The bad loans for the project cost the public $4 million.arkansasonline.com, Hubbell Indictment, Nov. 13, 1998, by The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette  November 15, 1998  Robert W. Palmer  Robert W. Palmer was the land appraiser for one of the Castle Grande loans, he later admitted to conspiring with Jim McDougal and others with Madison Guaranty savings association. The conspiracy was to inflate the estimates used for the loans. Kenneth Starr's investigators found that Palmer inflated estimates used to support loans made to Gov. Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas. Mr. Palmer did many appraisals for loans for Madison Guaranty. The larger appraisals was for a $1.05 million loan to Gov. Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas and an associate to buy a water and sewer system for the Castle Grande project. Later appraisals showed the system to be worth about 1/2 of that loan. Later when the loan went into default it was one of the largest losses to Madison, which collapsed in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of $68 million. Palmer pleaded guilty on December 6, 1994 to Federal charges of conspiracy, related to Whitewater. He was sentenced on June 16, 1995, to 3 years probation with the first year home detention and was fined $5,000. He was later pardoned by Bill Clinton in a controversial manner. \\"Appraiser on Madison Loans in Plea Accord\\" NY Times, By STEPHEN LABATON, Published: December 6, 1994 Jim McDougal Starting in 1982 Jim McDougal operated Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan. On April 14, 1997, McDougal was convicted of 18 felony counts of fraud conspiracy charges. The counts had to do with fraudulent loans made by Madison, the S&L; which failed in the late 1980s. As his Savings and Loan was Federally insured the bad loans ($68 million) were paid by the taxpayers. Criminal referral on Madison Guaranty fraud loans were given first to U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, Paula Casey who declined to the seek prosecutions. Casey had been appointed to her post by President Bill Clinton and also had been his student. Federal special prosecutors later obtained convictions of 14 persons in Arkansas of more than 40 crimes. The defendants included the sitting Governor, Jim Guy Tucker, who was forced to resign as well as Jim McDougal, Bill Clinton's partner in Whitewater.Washington Post time lineCNN whitewater reportCNN reportCaught In The Whitewater - CBSCNN Report: McDougal had no access to his heart medication nor doctors just before his death Hickman Ewing reduced Jim McDougal's prison sentence in exchange for testimony that Susan McDougal refused to confirm.Rose Law Firm Billing Records, PBS, WGBH educational foundation, Frontline *Labaton, Stephen. \\"Appraiser on Madison Loans in Plea Accord\\", New York Times, December 6, 1994Snopes.com on Jim McDougal's death  David Hale  Since 1979, David Hale ran the Small Business Investment Corporation (SBIC), Capital Management Services, Inc., that was licensed to provide lending to minorities and the economically disadvantaged.The loans were matched and backed by the Small Business Administration (SBA). David Hale testified that he and Jim McDougal, with future-Governor Jim Guy Tucker, created the scheme that would use Hale's SBIC as a pass-through to generate additional loans from Madison. Dean Paul, a friend and business associate of Hale's, borrowed $825,000 from Madison to buy three properties from David Hale. But Paul never used the money. It went instead to Hale, who used it to recapitalize his SBIC with matching funds from the SBA. Hale then loaned a $150,000 downpayment to Jim Guy Tucker and business partner, R.D. Randolph, who together bought out a portion of Ward's Castle Grande holdings for $1.2 million. Tucker and Randolph borrowed the additional $1.05 million from Madison. McDougal then loaned his old friend and political mentor, Senator William Fulbright, $700,000 to buy out the bulk of Ward's remaining holdings. The net effect was to remove Ward's non-recourse loan from the Madison books and generate substantial sales profits and commissions for Madison. The transactions were designed to be confusing to keep the regulators from finding Ward's loan and Madison's full investment in Castle Grande. The federal thrift examiners arrived the first week of March, 1986. The Dean Paul loan was completed on February 28. The loans did not miss the examiners. Jim Clark, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board Examiner-in-Charge at Madison, discovered that Seth Ward was behind the Castle Grande deal. The land was purchased illegally with Madison money. The Castle Grande loan like other loans were \\"pyramid scheme\\" intended to enrich institution insiders and bolster the net worth of the S&L.; Clark said Madison was one of the 3 worst cases of insider dealing that he did ever seen in his 20 years as an examiner.  Hillary Clinton  Hillary Clinton has said she did not work on the Castle Grande project, when questioned by two separate federal agencies and part of the Hillary Clinton and Whitewater probe \\"I don't believe I knew anything about any of these real estate parcels and projects. . . . \\" she said in an RTC interview in May 1995. But later Rose Law Firm billing records were discovered in the book room family quarters of the White House. Clinton said she had no idea how they got there. Billing records showed that she charged Madison for about 30 hours on work with Seth Ward over 4 months in 1985 and 1986. She and her lawyers said it was work with a development called IDC, thus the confusion. IDC was the company that sold the land to Madison. She said the only Castle Grande she knew was Castle Grande Estates the trailer park, for which she did no work.NY Post, Hillary, By John Crudele, July 5, 2016 Hillary Clinton told Barbara Walters on ABC in a Jan. 12, 1996 interview: \\"Castle Grande was a trailer park on a piece of property that was about a thousand acres big. I never did work for Castle Grande.\\" \\"And so when I was asked about it last year [by the RTC], I didn't recognize it, I didn't remember it. The billing records show I did not do work for Castle Grande. I did work for something called IDC, which was not related to Castle Grande.\\" Walters asked.\\" Was that Seth Ward?\\" Hillary Clinton replied \\"And Seth Ward was involved in that on behalf . . . \\" Barbara Walters: \\"Separate deal?\\" Hillary Clinton reply: \\"Separate deal completely.\\"washingtonpost.com, Hillary Clinton, June 2, 1996 RTC lawyers interviewed Hillary Clinton in the White House, on Feb. 14, 1996, asked: RTC:\\" Can you explain to me what you mean by IDC and Castle Grande are, in your mind, a separate deal completely?\\" Hillary Clinton's reply: > Well, my understanding is that the work for Madison concerned property that > was referred to then at the time and continually by the Rose Firm as IDC or > Industrial Development Corporation property.

He was one of the very few amongst the Montenegrin diaspora to achieve higher level education.  Early life  Nikola Petanovic was born in 1892 in the village of Podgor in Crmnica, Principality of Montenegro. In 1912 he went moved to the United States of America at the call of his brother Mitar Petanovic, who already settled as a US citizen. Young Nikola studied English in Butte, Montana, the then-largest Montenegrin emigration colony in the United States, and quickly became prolific in it. To support himself he worked on ranches during the season, having little time for his studies in the libraries. For his nickname he chose \\"The Naiad\\", referring the mythological nymph that had the power of precognition, implying that he will do the same for Montenegro. Afterwards, he moved to California and started his literary publicist career. In 1923 he published in San Francisco in Serbo-Croat his first work, the \\"Ponos života\\" (\\"Pride of Life\\"), a poetic philosophical novel. He was plagued by his poverty heavily until the end of his life, barely managing to make ends meet.  Political work  Upon hearing about the 1918 unification of Montenegro with the Kingdom of Serbia, Nikola was gravely worried. Considering that Montenegro's sovereignty was unjustly extinguished, ever since 1924 he worked on the gathering of the post-World War I growing Montenegrin emigration's intelligence in North America. He went forth publishing brochures and holding lectures about facts about Montenegro, attempting to inform and unite the Montenegrin diaspora on the West Coast. In 1927 he formed a \\"Board for a Sovereign and Independent Montenegro\\" and met with a member of the House of Petrović-Njegoš with the same Montenegrin sovereigntist ideas, Milo Petrović- Njegoš. He became the Editor in Chief of the Board's political magazine, the \\"Montenegrin Mirror\\", which spread the word in English propagating the creation of an independent Montenegro from the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. He chose the name as an ironic protest to one of the major works of the Montenegrin writer Petar II Petrović-Njegoš, the \\"Serb Mirror\\" (Огледало српско). In 1929 Nikola expanded cooperation with Prince Milo Petrović-Njegoš forming with him, freedom fighters Krsto Zrnov Popović and Marko Zekov Popović, and former regent Evgenije Popović the \\"Montenegrin National Committee\\" in Geneva bent on uniting the whole Montenegrin emigration. The Committee published the brochure \\"The Greatest Crime in History\\" defining that there has been never a worse crime in the history of mankind from the total annexation of Montenegro by Serbia. Petanovic saw in Prince Milo Petrović- Njegoš a possible new monarch of a restored Montenegrin kingdom and dedicated to him a poem: \\"The Royal Heritage will be Restored; The Sun shall Smile upon Montenegro once again\\". Petanovic attempted to use influential people to affect the American public opinion and authorities to liken the idea of a sovereign Montenegro, which would be under a US protectorate. Nikola had already perceived the United States' bright future as one of the leading nations in world. The US State Department never paid heed to his calls however, because they considered the unification legal, legitimate and unquestionable. Petanovic's desires to conduct a free democratically held referendum in the territories of the once Montenegrin realm that would decide if it would stay in Yugoslavia or regain independence on the basis of the, popular in the Western World, self-determination, in this case that of the Montenegrin People, reached a moot end gaining no support. During this period his most important work is the \\"Troslavia and five small Slavic nations\\", an ironic depiction of the Yugoslavian kingdom supporting the proposals of the Kingdom of Italy for breakup of the South Slavic country and establishment of several Slavic mini-nations at the coast of the Adriatic Sea under Italian influence. Nicholas was one of the few who already also depicted the Macedonians as a distinct people as well. His other significant works were \\"Without Homeland\\", referring to the Montenegrin people, the \\"Naiad\\" and \\"Dayan\\". Petanovic saw the origins of Montenegro in ancient Doclea and claimed that the specific ethno-genetic makeup in the ethnogenesis of Illyrian blood, which allegedly made the Slavs living in what was once Montenegro far closer to the Albanians, was sufficient enough for them to be proclaimed as a distinct ethnic group, akin but not identified directly with the Serbs themselves - in this claim laid as the basis for Petanovic's desire to ask for national self-determination of the Montenegrins. Although not essentially a historian, Nikola touched the historical subjects claiming that the Slavic people appeared in the territories of Montenegro only in the 9th century in its ethnic form and through mixing with the local populations, claimed that a distinct mix identity was born in Montenegro.  Death and legacy  In 1931 Nicholas Petanovich withdrew from public life and abandoned his activities on promoting Montenegro's independence, claiming he was fighting a completely lost cause. He died on 29 January 1932 in his 40th year due to poor health caused by his unhealthy lifestyle, never marrying nor having children because of his virtually non-existent social life. With his death the Montenegrin Mirror stopped being published and the Montenegrin Committee was disbanded. He was buried at the Colma cemetery just outside San Francisco, California. Nikola Petanovic was completely an unknown person to the public eye and his works never widespread until the sovereigntist and pro-independence movements emerged in the late 20th century with Montenegro promoting and justifying its secession from its state union with the Republic of Serbia. An example is the Montenegrin Matrix, which published the work of Gordan Stojović \\"Nikola Petanović - Crnogorsko Ogledalo\\" (Nikola Petanovich - The Montenegrin Mirror) that revealed the first facts about this historical figure to the Montenegrin public.

O'Connor became interested in jazz music at an early age and played piano with local jazz bands while in high school. He continued to work occasionally as a musician into the 1940s, but had abandoned the thought of music as a career by the time he enrolled at Catholic University in Washington. He wrote his doctoral thesis on the aesthetics of popular music. He was ordained as a Roman Catholic priest of the Paulist order in 1948. In 1951 he became the Catholic chaplain at Boston University. In 1954 he served on the board of the first Newport Jazz Festival and appeared at the event in his priest collar, acting as master of ceremonies for concerts and moderator of panel discussions. His introduction of John Coltrane at the festival in 1965 can be heard on Coltrane's New Thing at Newport (as well as My Favorite Things: Coltrane at Newport), and his introduction of Dave Brubeck at the 1971 festival can be heard on Brubeck's The Last Set at Newport. O'Connor also introduced Duke Ellington and the members of his orchestra (along with personal quips) at the 1956 Festival, as heard on Ellington's Ellington at Newport. O'Connor wrote a weekly jazz column for The Boston Globe and freelanced for Down Beat, Metronome, and other music magazines. He did jazz radio shows on WGBH-FM for many years previous to, and overlapping with, the advent of TV at WGBH, in 1955. When television started, he continued in the new medium on Jazz with Father O'Connor. His guests included national jazz figures, like Cannonball Adderley and George Shearing, among others, as well as local Boston musicians like \\"Boots\\" Mussulli, Herb Pomeroy and Al and Buzzy Drootin. In 1962, O'Connor became the director of radio and television for the Paulist Fathers in New York City. He also hosted a syndicated radio show and the local TV show, \\"Dial M for Music\\", on WCBS-TV (New York City). The show was popular in the New York area, and many great jazz musicians performed on it; including Duke Ellington (in a trio with Horace Silver and Johnny Hodges), The Modern Jazz Quartet, Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Big Band, Bill Evans, Woody Herman, Maynard Ferguson, Peggy Lee, Mongo Santamaría, Gene Krupa, and Joe Williams, among others. O'Connor became a fixture on the New York jazz scene, and remained one even after being named director of the Mount Paul Novitiate, a church training center in Oak Ridge, New Jersey, four years later. In 1980, O'Connor was hired as the executive director of Straight and Narrow, a drug and alcohol treatment center in Paterson, New Jersey. In his later years, his profile in the jazz world became considerably lower. Nevertheless, he remained the \\"Jazz Priest\\" to the end, producing benefit concerts by Marian McPartland and other musicians for Straight and Narrow with the help of his longtime friend George Wein. O'Connor retired in 2002. He died of a heart attack at the age of 81 in Wayne, New Jersey, on June 29, 2003.

They are a Tucanoan group located in the eastern part of the Amazon Basin in Vaupés Department in Colombia and Amazonas State in Brazil. As of 2000 there were at least 500 Barasanas in Colombia, though some recent estimates place the figure as high as 1950.Determining their exact number is difficult, because inclusion in the group is determined by one’s father’s language. The figure of 500 refers to this Vaupés group, and excludes people whose mother language is Barasana.See For the figure of 1950 see , and A further 40 live on the Brazilian side, in the municipalities of Japurá and São Gabriel da Cachoeira. The Barasana refers to themselves as the jebá.~baca, or people of the jaguar (Jebá \\"jaguar\\" is their mythical ancestor). Geography, ecology Barasana territory lies in the central sector of the Colombian Northwest Amazon. The Barasana inhabit the Pirá-piraná river basin of the Comiseria de Vaupés between the two main river systems of the Vaupés River and the Japurá River . The area is a tropical rainforest, interspersed with occasional stands of Mauritia flexuosa or mirití palm and savanna with xerophytic vegetation. Rainfall averages around per year.pp.18-19Jean Elizabeth Jackson, ‘Language Identity of the Vaupés Indians,’ p.50 Its climate is marked by four seasons, a long dry spell from December to March followed by the wet season from March to August, a short dry season between August and September, followed by a rainy season from September until December. The average temperature varies between 20 and 30 degrees Celsius (68 and 86 °F). It is notorious for its treacherous rivers that are choked with dangerous rapids and falls. The number of faunal species is not rich, and individual animals not common, though hunting game is prized as the fundamentally male mode of procuring food. Fish also, despite the many rivers, do not abound. For a list of edible foods and animals in the Vaupés area see pp. 11-14, and Appendix 3, pp. 274-5 Ethnic group context The Vaupés area is inhabited by roughly 20 tribes or descent groups.Irving Goldman, writing in 1948, identified 18 sub-tribes of the Eastern Tukunoan group Irving Goldman, ‘The Tribes of the Uapes-Caqueta Region,’ p.764: The Taiwano taxonomy has 22 groups: Bará, Barasana, Cabinyari, Carijona, Cubeo, Curripaco, Desana, Letuama, Macú, Macuna, Pirá-Tapuya, Siriano, Taiwano, Tanimuka, Tatuyo, Tariana, Tucano, Tuyuca, Uanano, Yauna, and Yurutí. See François Correa Rubio, Por el Camino de la Anaconda Remedio, Univ. Nacional de Colombia, 1996 p.375 The word tribe is generally disdained by anthropologists, who prefer to define groups by such terms as sib, language group, exogamous group or phratry,Jean Elizabeth Jackson, ‘Language Identity of the Vaupés Indians,’ p.50,Elsa Gomez Imbert, ‘Conceptual categories and linguistic classification’, in John Joseph Gumperz, Stephen C. Levinson (eds.)

See Irving Goldman 1963 p.15; Gerardo Reichel- Dolmatoff ‘Review of The Cubeo: Indians of the Northwest Amazon by Irving Goldman ,’ p.1378. For multilingualism see Jean Elizabeth Jackson, ‘Language Identity of the Vaupés Indians,’ p.56: Stephen Hugh-Jones, The Palm and the Pleiades, p.21. Apart from the Maku and the Arawakan, Vaupés Indians belong to Eastern Tukanoan language family, most prominent of them being, other than the Barasana, the Desana, the Bará, the Tukano proper, the Macuna, the Tatuyo, and the Cubeo.Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff, Shamanism and art of the eastern Tukanoan Indians: Colombian northwest Amazon, p.1 Despite the established system of intermarriage, their languages are mutually unintelligible.Jean Elizabeth Jackson, ‘Language Identity of the Vaupés Indians,’ p.53 A Creole-type lingua franca, called locally lingua geral, created by the Jesuit missionaries as a general language for communicating with Indians in the lower reaches of the Amazon,Michael Shermer, In Darwin's shadow: the life and science of Alfred Russel Wallace : a biographical study on the psychology of history, Oxford University Press US, 2002 p.67 is also spoken among them. History The various Tukanoan myths of origin refer to a westward upstream migration from Brazil, and Reichel-Dolmatoff believes that there is a ‘kernel of historical truth’ behind these uniform traditions.Jean Elizabeth Jackson, The fish people, p.21. Curt Nimuendajú thought that the east Tukanoan tribes invaded from the west, and that the autochthonous population consisted of the Makú, assuming that these smaller hunter-gatherers were older than the agriculturalist newcomers.Aleksandra Yurievna Aĭkhenvald, Language contact in Amazonia. Oxford University Press, 2002 reprint, p.24 Desultory Spanish contact with the Vaupés region goes back to the 16th century. But historical records show that the Tukano peoples shifted to the remote headwaters of the Río Negro as a refuge, in flight from the slave trade and diseases, and forced relocations introduced by the Portuguese in the late 18th.century.Jonathan David Hill, Made-from-bone: trickster myths, music, and history from the Amazon, University of Illinois Press, 2008 p.66Alcionilio Brüzzi Alves da Silva, A civilização indígena do Uaupés: observações antropológicas etnográficas e sociológicas, São Paulo, 1962 p.22, cited Stephen Hugh-Jones, The Palm and the Pleiades, p.21 It was Alfred Russel Wallace, in travelling up the Vaupés river in 1850Stephen Hugh-Jones,The Palm and the Pleiades, p.4.Irving Goldman, The Cubeo Indians of the Northwest Amazon, University of Illinois Press, 1963 p.12 puts the date as 1853. The difference may reflect the fact that Wallace’s book, Palm Trees of the Amazon and their uses, was published in 1853. who first took note of Indians like the Barasana and their dialects.He composed ten syllabaries and synonymies, published in the first edition of his account, but dropped from subsequent editions. See Michael Shermer, In Darwin's shadow: the life and science of Alfred Russel Wallace, p.67 and the rites of their Yurupary cult. According to his account, traders were already active in the area.Camilo Domínguez, Augusto Gómez, La economía extractiva en la Amazonia colombiana, 1850-1930, Corporación Colombiana Para la Amazonia Araracuara, 1990 p.124 Catholic and Protestant missionaries entered the area in the last decades of the 19th century. One major reaction to this evangelisation in the Vaupés, initiated by Venancio Aniseto Kamiko,Robin M.Wright & Jonathan D.Hill, ‘Venancio Kamiko: Wakuenai Shaman and Messiah,’ in E. Jean Langdon and. Gerhard Baer, (eds.) Portals of Power: : Shamanism in South America, University of New Mexico Press, 1992 1992 pp. 257-286. was to create a wave of messianic cults among the tribes.Stephen Hugh-Jones, ‘Shamans, Prophets, Priests and Pastors,’ pp.47ff. Missionaries were convinced that the central cult of Yurupary, their culture hero,Stephen Hugh-Jones, The Palm and the Pleiades, p.6. was the work of the Devil, though this was a series of rituals rather than a divinity.Goldman wrote that the \\"great spirit\\"called Yuruparí believed to be worshipped through the Vaupés was a fiction. ‘In simple fact there is no Yuruparí. The term is jargon from the trade language of the Amazon based heavily upon Tupían and is used indiscriminately by the Indians to refer to anything that is sacred and taboo.’ Irving Goldman, The Cubeo Indians of the Northwest Amazon, p.255. The result was widespread damage to the native culture. as ceremonial houses were burnt, ritual ornaments destroyed, and secret masks displayed to the tribe’s women and children, who were previously forbidden to look at them.Stephen Hugh-Jones, The Palm and the Pleiades, pp.4.5 Messianic shamanism, strongly connected with jaguar shamanism, declined further with the establishment of Catholic missions in the first decades of the 20th century.Stephen Hugh-Jones, ‘Shamans, Prophets, Priests and Pastors,’ p.57 The German traveller Theodor Koch-Grünberg spent two years at the turn of the century (1903–05) travelling throughout the region and provided a classic account of the Indians’ material culture and languages, which long remained the authoritative source for information of these tribes.Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff , ‘Review of The Cubeo: Indians of the Northwest Amazon by Irving Goldman ,’ in American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 65, No. 6 (Dec., 1963), pp. 1377-1379, p.1377. Rubber-gatherers from the beginning of the 20th century began to aggressively exploit the area, as they did again the World War II when the urgency of improved rubber supplies led to a rubber boom in the area. Their violent presence caused considerable upheaval and suffering, finally driving the Indians, after fierce resistance, into the less accessible backwaters.Stephen Hugh-Jones, The Palm and the Pleiades, 1979 preface Population decline, as a result, has been a marked feature of the past one hundred and fifty years,Stephen p.25Jean Elizabeth Jackson, The fish people, p.21 The earliest professional ethnological fieldwork was done by Irving Goldman in 1939-40 among the Cubeo Indians.Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff, Shamanism and art of the eastern Tukanoan Indians: Colombian northwest Amazon, p.1 Postwar missionary work, colonizing movements, and the activities of the linguists attached to Christian proseyltisation still engage, according to Stephen Hugh-Jones, in the ‘criminal folly’ of ethnocide by their programmatic hostility to traditional religionStephen Hugh-Jones, The Palm and the Pleiades:Initiation and Cosmology ion Northwest Amazonia, p.5 Economy The Barasana are slash-and-burn swidden horticulturalists who supplement their food with hunting and fish-gathering, with different roles allocated to men (poisoners) and women (gatherers of the poisoned catch). The economy is inelastic, subsistence-oriented and egalitarian.Goldman, The Cubeo Indians of the Northwest Amazon, p.85 As both hunter-gatherers, and gardeners, the Barasana exploit the forest in various ways to obtain a wide variety of foodstuffs. Bread made of bitter cassava is their staple food; Barasana culture itself is said to be grounded on cultivation of cassava production. but they also harvest maize, bananas, cooking plantains, yams, sweet potatoes, pineapples, sugarcane and considerable quantities of fruits picked in the forests or from cultivated trees like the Pithecellobium dulce, the \\"Madras thorn\\" or mene.Stephen Hugh-Jones, The Palm and the Pleiades, p.65 Fishing supplies most of the protein in their diet, supplemented by game, rodents and birds mostly, but woolly monkeys and peccariesThere are two varieties of peccary (kii jece) hunted, the white-lipped peccary (Tayassu tajacu: kii jece) and the collared peccary. R.A. Donkin, ‘The Peccary’, in Transactions, American Philosophical Society, (vol. 75), Part 5, 1985 pp.1-152, p.61)Gomez- Imbert, Elsa, & Kenstowicz, Michael, ‘Barasana Tone and Accent, p.434 are also culled, traditionally with blowguns, but most recently also with shotguns.Stephen Hugh-Jones, The Palm and the Pleiades, pp.29-30 Unlike most South American peoples, the Barasana are not particularly passionate about honey, which they gather occasionally. Beeswax, on the other hand, is highly prized for its use in ceremonial contexts.Stephen Hugh-Jones, The Palm and the Pleiades, p.163. From cassava leaves they extract a native chicha. Coca and tobacco, the latter prepared either in cigars or as snuff, are also cultivated. They prepare their local entheogenic drink ayahuasca, which they call yagé,The English botanist Richard Spruce made the first report of this drink in his journey among the Tukuano Indians in 1852, roughly contemporaneously with Wallace’s visit. For details see Andrei A. Znamenski, The beauty of the primitive: shamanism and Western imagination, pp.148ff. from the endemic Banisteriopsis caapi, a liana locally known as \\"vine of the soul\\" or \\"vine of the ancestors\\".; this text contains a photo of a Barasana tracing religious patterns while under the influence of the yagé decoction on p. 124 Social structure The Tukunoan descent groups are subdivided into ranked and named sibs. The dominant feature of their social organization is language group exogamy, which requires that one must always marry a spouse speaking a language different from one’s own.Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff, Shamanism and art of the eastern Tukanoan Indians: Colombian northwest Amazon, p.1. However, the Cubeo do not practice language group exogamy, since they marry among same language phratries, that is they practice linguistic endogamy, The Cubeo Indians of the Northwest Amazon, pp.42ff.: Stephen Hugh-Jones, The Palm and the Pleiades, pp.23-24. For failing to observe this principle, their status as ‘real people’ becomes a matter of doubt among the Eastern Tukunoans, of which the Barasana are one. See Jonathan David Hill, History, power, and identity: ethnogenesis in the Americas, 1492-1992, University of Iowa Press, 1996 p.144. Among the Barasana themselves, exceptions however do exist to the principle of linguistic exogamy, since they intermarry with Taiwanos whose language is regarded as almost identical to their own.Jean Elizabeth Jackson The fish people: linguistic exogamy and Tukanoan identity in northwest Amazonia, p.20, p.246 n.11. This means that one’s father’s language determines one’s inclusion or exclusion in Barasana identity, which accounts for the custom of virilocality. Women marrying out, though speaking Barasana as their native tongue, are therefore excluded from Barasana identity.Gomez-Imbert, Elsa, & Kenstowicz, Michael, ‘Barasana Tone and Accent,’ , p.420 Concern for exogamy is obsessive and is considered by Reichel-Dolmstoff to be the most important social rule of all.Shamanism and art of the eastern Tukanoan Indians: Colombian northwest Amazon, p.1 The Vaupés social system may be divided in four units in ascending hierarchy, namely (a) the local descent group, (2) the sib, (3) the language-aggregate, and finally (4) the phratry.Jean Elizabeth Jackson, ‘Language Identity of the Vaupés Indians,’ p.53. Kinship is based on a ‘a Dravidian’ type sib system, with bilateral cross-cousin marriage between people from hierarchically order patrilineal sibs.Stephen Hugh-Jones, The Palm and the Pleiades, p.22 Like most other groups of the Vaupés system, the Barasana are an exogamous patrilineal and patrilocal descent group, with a segmentary social structure. The constitutive groups live in isolated settlements in units of four to eight families dwelling in multifamily longhouses. The Barasana have seven exogamous phratries,Jean Elizabeth Jackson The fish people: linguistic exogamy and Tukanoan identity in northwest Amazonia, p.246 n.11. Hugh-Jones lists only 5 neighbouring groups with whom the Barasana intermarry: the Bará, Tatuyo, Taiwano, Kabiyeri and Makuna. Stephen Hugh-Jones, The Palm and the Pleiades, p.27. and five sibs, common descendants of the Yebi Meni Anaconda people, traditionally ranked hierarchically in decreasing order of seniority, with each assigned a distinct ritual role as (1) Koamona, ritual chiefs (2) Rasegana, dancers and chanters (3) Meni Masa, warriors (4) Daria, shamans and (5) Wabea, cigar lighters. These ritual functions restricted to distinct sibs, reflect a dying tradition, and survive now mainly as a matter of ideology.Stephen Hugh-Jones, The Palm and the Pleiades, pp.25-26. Barasana society is rigidly divided along sexual lines. Men and women enter dwellings by different doors, pass most of their lives in separation, a reality reinforced by their ceremonial Yurupari rites.Stephen Hugh-Jones , The Palm and the Pleiades, preface Yet in Vaupés societies women have higher status, and marriages are more stable than in other South Amerindian groups, perhaps since intertribal warfare ended several decades ago, which may explain why women are not ‘pawns in the displays of male brinksmanship.’ Jean Elizabeth Jackson The fish people: linguistic exogamy and Tukanoan identity in northwest Amazonia, p.194 Language Barasana is classified as one of the eastern Tucanoan languages. It is mutually intelligible with Taiwano, and both are considered dialect variations of each other, though it is reported that Taiwano speakers are assimilating to the Barasana with whom they have very close relations of exchange, leading them to adopt the Barasana tongue.Elsa Gomez-Imbert, 'Conceptual categories and linguistic classification,' in John J. Gumperz, Stephen C. Levinson (eds.) Rethinking Linguistic Relativity, Cambridge University Press, 1996 p.443. Popular culture The Barasana were the subject of Disappearing World (TV series), episode 4, The War of the Gods, aired on 22 June 1971 for British Granada Television. The episode shows four young anthropologists travelling into the jungle to show how to live as a Barasana, before getting into a deeper debate about what it means to be a marginalised tribe in a changing world and documenting Barasana magical rituals and traditions.

Initially garrisoned in Messina, Sicily, the division was made up entirely of Sicilians. History =Second Italo-Ethiopian War= 28 February 1935, the Peloritana division was mobilized and sent to Somalia 5 March 1935. It was initially tasked with the defence of the coastal cities of Mogadishu, Merca and Kismayo. It has formed during that time the 129th territorial infantry division Peloritana II and 129th infantry brigate Peloritana II. Division first seen a combat in March, 1936, seizing the Harar city straddling the Erer River. In the final Italian advance in April, 1936, the division was relegated to the second-line duties.

It was deployed as part of strategic reserve in Korçë and Pogradec District. 13 November 1940, the first four battalions have lined against Greek forces near Qafa e Qarrit, as Italian front began to give way. But the majority of units did not leave Pogradec District until March, 1941. Then it was moved to the direction of Këlcyrë and finally took the positions at Tomorrica valley, at the rear of 4th Alpine Division Cuneense. It participated in limited defensive fighting at Bregas. 13 April 1941, the Piemonte division have started an advance, soon reaching Ersekë on Greek border after some fighting with Greek rearguard units. After the end of war the division was temporarily placed in Korçë, but in June, 1941, was sent to Peloponnese peninsula, along the Corinth Canal. The garrisons were also established at Patras, Aigio, Paralia Platanos, Pyrgos, Elis. Battalion-strength detachments were also in Zakynthos island and Nafplio.

He emigrated from Poland in 1972, removed from power after the 1968 Polish political crisis. Brus spent the rest of his life in the United Kingdom. Early life and education Brus was born in 1921 into a Jewish family in Płock in the Second Polish Republic. He began his studies there at Wolna Wszechnica. After the 1939 German and Soviet invasion of Poland, he fled to the Soviet occupation zone and settled in Lwów (now Lviv, Ukraine) a Polish city conquered by the Red Army. He continued his studies at John Casimir University (now Lviv University) and later at the Leningrad University (now Saint Petersburg State University) in the Soviet Union. He then fled to Saratov, where he was a Comintern teacher and also worked in a factory. Towards the end of the war, Brus returned to Poland with the Soviet controlled Polish First Army, only to find that his parents and sister had been killed in the Treblinka concentration camp. He ran into his young Jewish wife Fajga (now Helena Wolińska), who he thought also died in the Holocaust. but she was by then married to a commander of Gwardia Ludowa and first commandant of the communist state police Milicja Obywatelska, a deputy minister of the Ministry of Public Security of Poland (1945–1949). Career After the war, Brus became the head of propaganda for the communist Polish Workers' Party (PPR). He also wrote his doctoral thesis on the Marxist law of value and then started teaching at Warsaw University. In 1952 he wrote a propaganda textbook in which he expressed admiration for Joseph Stalin's work The Economic Problems of Socialism. He also attacked Titoism and Władysław Gomułka's ideas claiming that neither proposed Soviet paths to socialism. In 1955, Brus became the vice-chairman of a council which was to advise the Gomułka government on economic reforms, but, with the economic stabilization that followed the Poznań 1956 uprising, most of the council's proposals were ignored. In 1956, he remarried Wolińska, who had recently been fired from her job as a military prosecutor accused of violating the rule of law in staged trials of Polish officers which frequently resulted in executions. (reproduced on Applebaum's website) In 1961, Brus's most influential work The General Problems of the Functioning of the Socialist Economy was published. In it he argued that both democracy and market mechanisms were a necessity on the road to socialism. In 1965, he testified in defense of Jacek Kuroń and Karol Modzelewski, who were on trial for their \\"Open Letter to the Party\\" calling for democratic reforms. He also defended Leszek Kołakowski and Krzysztof Pomian when they were expelled from the Party, but in 1968 he was himself expelled. Between 1968 and 1972, Brus worked as a researcher in the Institute of Housing, Warsaw and was not allowed to publish under his real name. In 1972, he emigrated with Wolińska to the United Kingdom, having first temporary positions, first in Glasgow than in St. Antony's College, Oxford, eventually becoming Professor of Modern Russian and East European Studies and professorial fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford. In 1989, together with Kazimierz Laski, he published From Marx to the Market, in which the arguments presented in Brus's 1961 work were extended. Grave of Włodzimierz Brus and Helena Wolińska-Brus in Wolvercote Cemetery, Oxford Polish prosecutors issued a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) against his wife Wolinska on 20 November 2007.

Today it is the trailhead of several hiking routes in the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, and is on the way to the Boston Mills and Brandywine ski resorts.  History  The Jaite Company Paper Mill was the brain child of Charles Jaite, who founded the company on September 18, 1905. The mill remained in operation through 1951 and was then sold because of increasing competition in the south. After the property was sold to various owners, including Tecumseh who used the plant for making boxes, it ceased operation and was partially dismantled in 1984, some 5 years after the mill was included in the National Register of Historic Places. The remains of the factory can be seen on the Erie Canal Scenic Pathway somewhere around mile marker 19 or 20, between lock 31 and 32. When the factory's operation began to decline, the community of Jaite declined as well. Charles Jaite purchased the section of land along Riverview Road in 1906 and along Vaughn Road in 1917 to provide housing for the workers of his paper mill. It had \\"houses and a dormitory, and also a general store, post office, and railway station\\". Today, most of the buildings of Jaite still exist, painted yellow.

Accessories include handbags and umbrellas.  History  During World War II the company was known for making waterproof clothing for the United States Navy. Following the war the company partnered with DuPont to make material for use in raincoats. These coats, which were the first to have a patented removable liner, were sold in Philadelphia, where they became very popular. The company went public in the 1960s. By the 1970s the company had its own stores and was manufacturing not only raincoats but also other types of clothes and accessories. At the time two-thirds of all raincoats sold in the United States were London Fog. London Fog expanded internationally during the 1990s selling in places like the United Kingdom and China.

Quantum lithography is closely related to the fields of quantum imaging, quantum metrology, and quantum sensing. The effect exploits the quantum mechanical state of light called the NOON state. Quantum lithography was invented at Jonathan P. Dowling's group at JPL, and has been studied by a number of groups. Of particular importance, quantum lithography can beat the classical Rayleigh criterion for the diffraction limit. Classical photolithography has an optical imaging resolution that cannot be smaller than the wavelength of light used. For example, in the use of photolithography to mass-produce computer chips, it is desirable to produce smaller and smaller features on the chip, which classically requires moving to smaller and smaller wavelengths (ultraviolet and x-ray), which entails exponentially greater cost to produce the optical imaging systems at these extremely short optical wavelengths. Quantum lithography exploits the quantum entanglement between specially prepared photons in the NOON state and special photoresists, that display multi-photon absorption processes to achieve the smaller resolution without the requirement of shorter wavelengths. For example, a beam of red photons, entangled 50 at a time in the NOON state, would have the same resolving power as a beam of x-ray photons. The field of quantum lithography is in its infancy, and although experimental proofs of principle have been carried out using the Hong–Ou–Mandel effect, it is still a long way from practical uses.

It usually forms part of the deep foundation of a building, typically a multi-story building, structure or support base for heavy equipment, or of a bridge. The cast concrete pile cap distributes the load of the building into the piles. A similar structure to a pile cap is a \\"raft\\", which is a concrete foundation floor resting directly onto soft soil which may be liable to subsidence. Design Construction The mat is made of concrete which is an aggregate of small rocks and cement. This mixture has to be supported by a framework to avoid sagging and fracture while setting. This process is known as shuttering and reinforcing. The materials used are long steel bars with longitudinal protrusions between the piles held in shape by thinner tie wires. Once this steel mat is laid, timber is attached around the perimeter to contain the wet concrete mixture. Once poured, (usually as a series of small loads), the concrete is stirred to remove any air pockets that might weaken the structure when set. The concrete undergoes a chemical change as it hardens and this produces a lot of heat. Sometimes, if the mass of concrete is very large, pipes carrying refrigerant coolant are used in the mass to assist the setting process to prevent the concrete from cracking.

In 2001 MacDonald left London after 26-years and currently resides in Australia and Japan, where he is employed as a professional musician. In 2001 MacDonald was commissioned by the Piper and Drummer magazine and GHB Communications of Toronto to compose a modern piobaireachd. The piece was entitled Lament for Kenneth Alexander MacLennan of Connon Bridge and was published later that year. He commenced employment in February 2003 as the pipe major and music director of the Queensland Police Pipes and Drums, and went on to compose the tune named for the organisation's motto, With Honour We Serve. On 15 March 2006 at Government House, the Governor of Queensland appointed MacDonald as 'The Governor's Piper' and presented him with her personal standard, to be flown from his bagpipes during vice-regal occasions. As part of Homecoming Scotland 2009, two compositions were commissioned for the Edinburgh Military Tattoo. Salute to Australia by MacDonald was also played at the Tattoo's 2010 Australian tour. McDonald is the only Australian to have been Lone Piper at the Tattoo in both Scotland and Australia. The year 2009 also saw the publication of sixty tunes, R S MacDonald: The collection. In 2016 the Red Hot Chilli Pipers recorded MacDonald's composition The Fallen for charity. The accompanying video had in excess of two million views of the BBC. MacDonald is a captain in the Australian Army and part of their reserve army band and the 1 RAA Pipes and Drums in Brisbane, Queensland.

She also was a student of Tufts, and later Harvard, and worked with organic chemist Arthur Michael (known for the Michael reaction), who she subsequently married. Life and work Helen Cecilia De Silver Abbott was born in Philadelphia in 1857 to James Abbott and Caroline Montelius. Helen originally focused on being a pianist, studying extensively under the guidance of Miss Mary F. Howell. But in 1881, upon returning to America after performing in Paris, she turned to science after purchasing a copy of Helmholtz's Treatise on Physiological Optics. The scientific thoughts engulfed her and thus began her interest in optics and physics. At the time, she also began an interest in zoology. In the fall of 1882, Helen, after exploring more areas of science, became absorbed in medicine and entered into the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania. Her determination and social position of her affluent family allowed her to study alongside well-known physicians and professors in Pennsylvania. During her second year of medical school, Helen was forced to withdraw from the school due to her poor health sustained from a serious fall. While recovering, Helen shifted her interests towards research, and in particular, the chemical analysis of plants and topics in plant chemistry. After an incident in which some children ingested poisonous roots, she developed and pursued an interest in the chemical properties of plants, and their origin, aided by self-study, travel, and family connections. During the summer of 1887, Helen traveled throughout the European continent to visit with many accomplished scientists and to explore present possibilities for women's higher education. She visited laboratories and institutions in Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, and Britain. The scientists received Helen well due to the letter of introduction she had in her possession from Samuel Langley, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. When she returned to America in late 1887, she came to Boston and began research at the chemistry laboratory of Professor Henry Trimble of the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and later with Professor Arthur Michael of Tufts University, whom she married in 1888. Shortly after their marriage, they set off on a tour around the world, exploring many cultures. The couple returned to America in 1890, and Arthur accepted a position of director of the Chemical Laboratory at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts. In 1891, Helen and Arthur then moved to the English coastal town of Bonchurch on the Isle of Wight for several years, doing chemical research in a private, self-equipped laboratory. Helen's work from this laboratory produced four published papers regarding synthetic organic chemistry. On their return to the United States four years later, Helen Abbott Michael began studying the stereochemistry of sugar molecules. In 1895, she gave a presentation before the Franklin Institute on a review of synthetic work of sugars Soon after, Helen again began studying medicine at the Tufts University School of Medicine in 1900, earning an M.D. degree in June 1903. She established a hospital for the poor, where she practiced medicine, but then died the following year from influenza, contracted from one of her patients. She was buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia (section W-111). Michael predicted in a lecture on \\"Plant Analysis as an Applied Science\\" that chemists of the future would be able to produce, through synthetic means, the proteins, sugars, and starches needed in the human diet. She also held that during a plant's development, changes in its chemical composition provided an illustration of the theory of evolution.Biographical Snapshots of Famous Women and Minority Chemists: Snapshot - Helen Cecilia DeSilver Abbott Michael\\", Journal of Chemical Education.

Aryeh Leib was born in Balta, now in Ukraine in 1845.Introduction to Sefer Lekutim Yekarim, New Square, 1993. His father was Yaacov Nisson, a student of Rabbi Refoel of Bershad. His mother, Tziporah, was the daughter of Rabbi Yosef Zev Wolf Segal.Quoted several times for stories. He grew up in a town mostly occupied by Chasidim of Rabbi Refoel of Bershad,Based on reference to growing up around the followers of Rabbi Refoel in his book. although he was a student of Rabbi Dovid Twersky of Tolna and Rabbi Yitzchok Yoel Rabinowitz (1815-1878) of Kantikaziva (Prybuzhany, Mykolaivs'ka oblast).Of all quoted in his book Rabbi Dovid of Tolna has by far the most. In his book, he related how his uncle Reuven took care of Rabbi Shmuel Avraham Abba Shapiro of Slavita, while he recuperated from being lashed 1,500 times by the Russian government. Avraham and his brother Pinchas Shapiro, both grandchildren of Rabbi Pinchas of Koritz, were the owners of the Slavita printing house, which had been founded by their father, Rabbi Moshe Shapiro. As was common, the text of published books had to be edited so that they had nothing negative about the government. When the brothers were accused of not having the proper censorship license, their printing house was shut down and the brothers were sent to Siberia. In Aryeh Leib's book, he related several stories involving Rabbi Avraham and himself at the age of twelve. Aryeh Leib died in his Brooklyn home on December 19, 1928 and was buried in Old Montefiore Cemetery in Springfield Gardens, Queens.  Rabbinate  Aryeh Leib became rabbi of the Ukrainian town of Vradiivka in Mykolaiv Oblast, near the southern border of modern Ukraine. He served in several capacities in addition to his general rabbinic duties, including shechita (kosher animal slaughtering) and being a mohel (performing ritual circumcision). He was the catalyst for the founding of a Bikur Cholim organization (visiting the sick) and various charitable institutions. The founding of these organizations is detailed in his book. Tombstone of Rabbi Aryeh Leib Schochet in Old Montefiore Cemetery, Queens, New York.  Emigration  In August 1906, he emigrated to the United States with his son Abraham, after Abraham was drafted into the Russian army. While in Amsterdam awaiting his ship's embarkment, he was the guest of the Chief Rabbi there. After arriving at Ellis Island, he settled in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, New York, which was the largest Jewish neighborhood outside of the Lower East Side at that time. He had a close relationship with many of his American rabbinic colleagues. Upon arrival, he was reunited with his childhood friend Rabbi Yehoshua Heschel Rabinowits, the Rebbe of Monostritz, and with Rabbi Dovid Mordechai Twersky of Tolna-New York and Rabbi Moshe Tzvi Twersky of Tolna-Philadelphia.  Lekutim Yekarim  He published his book Lekutim Yekarim in 1926. It was one of the first books on the topic of chassidus published in America. It was printed with several approbation from leading rabbinic figures, including Rabbi Yehoushua Heschel Rabinowitz, the Rebbe of Monostritz, Rabbi Dovid Mordechai Twersky, Rebbe of Tolna and Rabbi Moshe Tzvi Twersky, Rebbe of Tolna - Philadelphia.

After the Bicesse Accords in 1993, the FAPLA were transformed in the Angolan Armed Forces (Forças Armadas de Angola) or FAA, by the integration of the members of the Armed Forces of Liberation of Angola or FALA, which constituted the former armed wing of UNITA. History In the early 1960s the MPLA named its guerrilla forces the \\"People's Army for the Liberation of Angola\\" (Exército Popular de Libertação de Angola - EPLA).Collelo, Thomas. Angola, a country study. Vol. 550, no. 59. Government Printing Office, 1991. Many of its first cadres had received training in Morocco and Algeria. In January 1963, in one of its early operations, the EPLA attacked a Portuguese military post in Cabinda, killing a number of troops. During the mid-1960s and early 1970s, the EPLA operated very successfully from bases in Zambia against the Portuguese in eastern Angola. After 1972, however, the EPLA's effectiveness declined following several Portuguese victories, disputes with National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA) forces, and the movement of about 800 guerrillas from Zambia to the Republic of Congo. On August 1, 1974 a few months after a military coup d'état had overthrown the Lisbon regime and proclaimed its intention of granting independence to Angola, the MPLA announced the formation of FAPLA, which replaced the EPLA. James writes that in 1974-75, '..after a period of six months, Moscow started to arm Neto's faction exclusively. The Soviet Union supplied the MPLA with $300 million worth of materiel as compared to $54 million over the previous fourteen years. The weapons that went to MPLA included AK-47 assault rifles, 120-mm mortars, 82-mm and 107-mm recoilless rifles, 37-mm and 14.5 mm antiaircraft guns..' and T-34, T-54, and PT-76 tanks.W. Martin James III, A Political History of the Civil War in Angola 1974-90,' 'New material in this edition 2011,' Transaction Publishers, original edition 1992, 54. Independence was set for November 11, 1975. By 1976 FAPLA had been transformed from lightly armed guerrilla units into a national army capable of sustained field operations. This transformation was gradual until the Soviet-Cuban intervention and ensuing National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) insurgency, when the sudden and large-scale inflow of heavy weapons and accompanying technicians and advisers quickened the pace of institutional change. Beginning in 1978, periodic South African incursions into southern Angola, coupled with UNITA's northward expansion in the east, forced the Angolan government to increase expenditures on Soviet military aid. Dependence also increased on military personnel from the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), and Cuba. Unlike African states that acceded to independence by an orderly and peaceful process of institutional transfer, Angola inherited a disintegrating colonial state whose army was in retreat. The confluence of civil war, foreign intervention, and large-scale insurgency made Angola's experience unique. After independence, FAPLA had to reorganize for conventional war and counterinsurgency simultaneously and immediately to continue the new war with South Africa and UNITA. Ironically, a guerrilla army that conducted a successful insurgency for more than a decade came to endure the same kind of exhausting struggle for a similar period. Combat performance Line up of decommissioned FAPLA combat vehicles in the South African National Museum of Military History: Ural-4320, PT-76, and T-34-85 tank. The Library of Congress Country Studies said in c.1988 that 'FAPLA's military performance is difficult to gauge, particularly in view of the propagandistic reports issued by the various forces that contended in the region.' On the one hand, UNITA had extended its range of operations from the remote south-eastern extremities throughout the entire country within a few years of Portugal's withdrawal. The South African Defence Force (SADF) had occupied parts of southern Angola for extended periods, virtually without contest, for the purposes of resupplying UNITA, intervening on its behalf, conducting reconnaissance flights and patrols, and attacking South-West Africa People's Organisation encampments. UNITA reported low morale among captured FAPLA conscripts, lack of discipline among troops, heavy losses of personnel and equipment in battle, countless ambushes and attacks on FAPLA forces, successful sabotage operations, and desertions by battalion-size FAPLA units. In the late 1980s, Angola's minister of defence publicly called for greater discipline in FAPLA, citing reports of theft, assaults, and drunken military drivers. As late as 1988, in the wake of reports of increased Angolan Air Force effectiveness, the South African Air Force commander dismissed the Angolans as \\"extremely unprofessional,\\" noting that \\"50 percent of the threat against us is Cuban.\\" FAPLA's air defence network in 1987. On the other hand, it could be argued that FAPLA had substantially improved its capabilities and performance. In the first place, FAPLA had begun to develop and acquire the organisation, doctrine, and equipment of a conventional army only during the civil war of 1975-76. It was then forced to fight a counterinsurgency war in the most remote and inaccessible parts of the country over extended lines of communications, without the requisite air or ground transport or logistical infrastructure. UNITA also enjoyed the advantages of operating in thinly populated areas along porous borders with Zambia and Zaire, with extensive SADF combat and logistic support, making it impossible for FAPLA to isolate or outflank UNITA. Moreover, military experts believe that counterinsurgency troops must outnumber guerrillas by ten to one in order to win such wars, a ratio FAPLA could never approximate. The air force and navy were even further behind and had required years to acquire the assets and the expertise needed for effective operations. Although the navy was of marginal use in the war, air power was critical. It was only after sufficient aircraft and air defence systems had been deployed in the mid-1980s that Luanda was able to launch and sustain large offensives in the south. In August 1986, FAPLA repelled UNITA after they had captured Cuito Cuanavale during Operation Alpha Centauri. Although they suffered heavy losses and perhaps relied too heavily on Soviet military doctrine, the FAPLA and the Angolan Air Force (FAPA/DAA) in the late 1980s showed increased strength, put greater pressure on UNITA, and raised the costs of South Africa's support for UNITA. Luanda's resolve and the improved capabilities and performance of its armed forces were among the essential conditions under which South Africa agreed to negotiate its withdrawal from Angola. Howe writes that Angola's defence minister acknowledged that senior officials profited significantly from weapons purchases; a newspaper sympathetic to the MPLA, Angolense reported that senior officers made US$320 million in commissions. citing 'Profits Fuel Angola's War,' Guardian Weekly, 8-14 July 1999. Following the peace agreement with UNITA prior to the 1992 elections, the two armies of FAPLA and UNITA commenced integration. Although the integration was never completed as UNITA returned to war following their loss of the elections, the army was renamed the Angolan Armed Forces (Portuguese: Forças Armadas Angolanas (FAA)), losing the close nominal association with the MPLA. Military regions Before 1988 FAPLA's areas of operations were divided into ten military regions.See also Defense Intelligence Agency, Military Intelligence Summary - Africa South of the Sahara, DDB 2680-104-85, ICOD 15 October 1984, Angola p9-10, declassified by letter dated April 29, 2014. The First Military Region comprised the Zaire and Uíge Provinces, while the Second comprised the Cabinda enclave. The Fifth and Sixth Military Regions faced Namibia in the south. In early 1988, however, calling this structure inadequate, the Ministry of Defence announced the formation of northern, eastern, southern, and central fronts. The northern front encompassed Zaire, Uíge, Malanje, Cuanza Norte, and Bengo provinces. The eastern front covered Lunda Norte, Lunda Sul, and Moxico provinces. No official information on the other fronts was available in late 1988, but presumably the southern front included Cuando Cubango, Huíla, and Namibe provinces, and the central front may have comprised Bié, Huambo, Benguela, and Cuanza Sul provinces.

He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1965 to 1989. He was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Oireachtas from 1973 to 1977. He stepped down from the Dáil at the 1989 general election, when his son Michael Creed held the seat for Fine Gael. Political career He first stood for Dáil Éireann at a by-election in March 1965 for the Cork Mid constituency, following the death of the Labour Party TD Dan Desmond. The by-election was won by Desmond's widow Eileen, but at the 1965 general election in April that year Creed won the fourth seat in the four-seat constituency. Creed was re-elected at seven further general elections, switching in 1981 to the new Cork North-West constituency when Cork Mid was abolished in boundary changes. From 1973 to 1977, he served as one of Ireland's first Members of the European Parliament (MEP), before MEPs were directly elected. Creed served on three of the European Parliament's committees: Agriculture, Public Health and the Environment, Regional Policy and Transport. He was also Chairman of Cork County Council from 1978 to 1979. In Garret FitzGerald's first coalition government, Creed was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Health from June to November 1981, and then at the Department of the Environment from November 1981 until the government was defeated in a budget vote in January 1982. Fianna Fáil was returned to power at the resulting February 1982 general election, but that government also was short-lived. When FitzGerald formed a new coalition government after another general election in November 1982, Creed was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Education, and held that post until a reshuffle in February 1986.

It is the oldest established church of any denomination in the city. History The church was built between July and November 1886 and the Reverend Dr. William Porcher DuBose presided over the first service on December 27, 1886. The church was originally located on the south bank of Crane Creek in Melbourne on land purchased from the Wright Brothers through a gift from Lucy Boardman. Members on the north side of Crane Creek traveled by boat and later by footbridge to attend services. For easier access, the congregation moved the church in 1897 to the north side of the creek. The new site was located on the Corner of Fee Avenue and U.S. 1 in Melbourne on land donated by William and Nora Stanford Wells. Jessie S. Goode provided the belfry and bell in 1923 as a gift to the church. The congregation renovated the church in 1927 and moved it again in 1963 to its current location. The Congregation The church congregation initially organized in June 1884 at the home of Richard W. Goode. Other founding members included the Campbell, Ellis, Ely, Grubb and Miller families—many of the prominent people of the area at the time. The congregation officially became a parish in 1949 and purchased land on Strawbridge Avenue for the construction of a new sanctuary, church offices and school classrooms.Holy Trinity Episcopal Church. \\"About Us\\", Holy Trinity Episcopal Academy website.

It occupies a narrow strip along the Atlantic coast, where the more frequent fog and haze generated offshore by the cool Canary Current provides sufficient moisture to sustain a variety of lichens, succulents, and shrubs. Geography It covers in Western Sahara and Mauritania. It is bounded on the west by the Atlantic Ocean, on the east by the North Saharan steppe and woodlands, on the north by the Mediterranean Acacia-Argania dry woodlands, and on the south by the Sahelian Acacia savanna. Climate The cool ocean current gives an even higher atmospheric stability in the desert, by cooling air at the base. This increase in atmospheric stability serves to further reduce the amount of rainfall. Therefore, the climate is extremely dry with some 30 mm of annual precipitation in Dakhla, Western Sahara and 40 mm of annual precipitation in Nouadhibou, Mauritania. Several years may pass without any rainfall at all. The climate is very sunny year-round with around 3,200 hours of annual bright sunshine, though far less sunny than in other parts of the desert of North Africa due to fog and haze. Air in the Atlantic coastal desert is rather moist and the relative humidity is generally over 60% while farther in the interior, it quickly lowers to 30% or less. Temperatures are also much more moderated in this coastal desert and are relatively warm to truly hot in all seasons. Averages daily temperature is 20 °C (68 °F) in Dakhla. Maximum average high temperatures are 27 °C (80.6 °F) while minimum average low temperatures are 13 °C (55.4 °F) in Dakhla. Ecology This bioregion is fairly rich in endemic plants but has no endemic fauna. The flora consists of a variety of lichens, succulents and drought-resistant shrubs. The Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus) is found here and the broad bays are important over-wintering grounds for large numbers of Palearctic wading birds. Greater flamingoes (Phoenicopterus roseus) and many other waterbirds congregate on the wetlands during their migrations. Mammals found here include the Dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), golden jackal (Canis aureus), fennec fox (Fennecus zerda), Rüppell's fox (Vulpes rueppelli), sand cat (Felis margarita), honey badger (Mellivora capensis) and striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena).

There are no reliable census data for the Macuna. The entire population was estimated at some 600 individuals in 1991 (compared with 400 in 1973), of which 450 lived in Colombia. Except of spoken accounts of a violent past with the southern neighbors, especially the Yauna and Tanimuka Indians, little is known about the early history of the Macuna. Their first mention are in the Portuguese accounts of the 18th century; as the commercial exploitation of rubber began in the Colombian Amazon in the late 19th century, contact with outsiders occurred more frequently, and with a negative effect. Men were taken away with force to work for the rubber patrons, a situation that lasted into the 1940s. The first Catholic mission was established in the area in the 1960s, though intermittent contact with missionaries has existed at least since the 18th century. The late 1970s and early 1980s brought a new boom into the region, with the growing of coca leaves for illegal trade, which brought substantial quantities of trade goods and money for the indigenous people who working for the White patrons established in the area. By the mid-1980s the production of coca leaves ended as abruptly as it began, but shortly after gold has been discovered along the Taraira River, just a few days away from the Macuna territory. Thousands of White gold miners entered the territory, a majority through Macuna lands, a situation which the Macuna used as a new source of trade goods and money. Additionally, many young men of the group go to the gold fields for a few weeks or months to look for gold on their own or under the temporary employment of a White patron. Despite this, the Macuna essentially subsist on swidden-cultivation, hunting, fishing, and gathering of forest products. The staple is manioc, but plantains, sweet potatoes, bananas and sugarcane are also cultivated. Meat comes from game such as pacas, tapir, peccaries, large birds, monkeys and caimans. The fur trade, especially the skins of jaguars, ocelots, and otters played an important role in the Macuna economy, until it was prohibited in the 1970s. In the 1990s the Colombian government created two Indian reservation encompassing most of the Macuna land, which provided them with enhanced control over their territory.

It was historically called Lisbrack, an anglicisation of the Irish name.Placenames Database of Ireland (see archival records) The N4 National primary route passes through the Main Street of the village, which is situated 6 km (4 miles) northwest of Longford Town. The population of Newtownforbes is 778, as of the 2016 Census. The national school is Scoil Mhuire. The village has a Catholic church, St. Mary's which has been recently restored. One feature of the renovation is the new west windows, by Joe Sheridan of Kilkenny which shows Virgin Mary with Jesus and St. John and a playfriend. It also shows St. Elither, a local saint, building the first Christian church of the village. The village also has four public houses, several shops and other amenities to cater for the expanding village. The sports complex has a floodlit pitch and indoor basketball court. Newtownforbes is in the parish of Clonguish; its Irish name is Cluain geis which means The Meadow of the Swans. Clonguish is bordered by four other parishes, Killashee, Templemicheal, Killoe and Drumlish. The parish also shares a common boundary with the province of Connacht in that it adjoins the parishes of Bornacoola and Gortletteragh in County Leitrim and is separated by the Shannon from Kilbarry in County Roscommon. The River Camlin flows through the south-western end of the parish. On the approach to Newtownforbes from Longford, there is an old house called Minard House on the left. It was built in the 1760s and was the base to a local radio station. History Newtownforbes takes its name from the Forbes family, also known as the Earl of Granard, who originated in Aberdeen and were granted lands in the area around 1621, and have been resident in Castleforbes since 1691. The family was in service to the Crown and successive generations were promoted to Viscount, Baronet and eventually Earldom. The family changed the name of the village from Lisbrack to Newtownforbes around 1750. Many of the houses in the original part of the village date from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. One of the four pubs in the town, Casey's Public House, was the last pub in the Midlands to stop the practise of bottling Guinness for the brewery and labelling it. Michael Collins reputedly drank in this pub from time to time. Heritage and culture =Castleforbes= Castle Forbes Castleforbes is situated about 5 km (3 miles) from Longford town and stands between Newtownforbes and Lough Forbes on the River Shannon. The castle and grounds are private with strictly no public access. History of Castleforbes Built to the design of John Hargrave from Cork, Castleforbes is a 19th-century structure of cut limestone. The entrance gateway of the castle is French style which is about one mile (1.6 km) from the castle itself. There are some narrow windows in the shape of an arch as well as the remains of some English style windows. In 1909 following the marriage of Bernard Forbes, 8th Earl of Granard to Beatrice, daughter of the wealthy Ogden Mills of Staatsburg, New York, the decoration of the castle was completed. Lady Jane structured the original building of Castleforbes in 1624. Over the years, the Castle has been added to. In 1825 the castle was partly burned. It was saved by a dog called 'Pilot' whose barking woke everyone in the castle. of land was given to them in 1619. In 1854 together the castle covered of land within its demesne. It was the largest demesne in Longford. In 1876 the total estate, including parts of land from around the parish, Clonguish, Drumlish, Killashee and near Mullingar, covered of land. Today Lady Georgina, the present owner, owns only the land within the demesne, . In 1911 the castle was the site of the introduction to Ireland of the Eastern grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis), when six pairs were given as a wedding gift to Lord Forbes and some later escaped into the wild. Castleforbes airfield The airfield, code EICS, was constructed in 1975 on the estate with a 1275 metre grass runway by Arthur Forbes, 9th Earl of Granard for the use of himself and invited friends. Following his death in 1992 the airfield's licence was revoked and it closed. =Newtownforbes railway station= Originally built by the Midland and Great Western Railway Company c. 1860 to serve the Mullingar to Sligo line the station was closed in 1963. It was probably built to designs by George Wilkinson (1814 - 1890), a noted architect of his day, who also completed the designs for a number of other railway stations for The Midland and Great Western Railway Company (on the Mullingar to Longford and the Inny Junction to Cavan lines) at this time. It remains an important component of the architectural and industrial heritage of County Longford (on the Mullingar to Longford and the Inny Junction to Cavan lines) at this time. It remains an important component of the architectural and industrial heritage of County Longford. =St Paul's Church of Ireland Church= This church was built or re-built in 1829 to a cruciform plan and is situated in Main Street. The quality of the craftsmanship in this church is well noted. A particularly notable feature is the box pews with fielded panels which are believed to be the last remaining examples in Ireland. Transport The railway passes through Newtownforbes but the station closed in 1963. The nearest railway station is Longford. The Bus Éireann service from Sligo to Dublin and Dublin airport stops in Newtownforbes with approximately 5 services each way, one of which is overnight. Journeytime to Dublin is typically under 3 hours.

He was first a retainer under the Amago clan of Izumo Province, but eventually became a daimyō in his own right. Early life His father, Kamei Hidetsuna, was killed in battle against the Mōri clan when the Mōri invaded and seized the Amago clan's lands, leaving no heir to the Kamei name. Korenori then took on this name, and in 1566, together with his brother-in-law, Yamanaka Shikanosuke, to whom he was related by virtue of marrying the younger sister of Shikanosuke's wife, he made efforts to reclaim these lands for the Amago, and to destroy Mōri Motonari and his army. However, the Amago clan fell in 1578, leaving Korenori without his lords; he then entered the service of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. His childhood name was Shinjuro (新十郎).

Interested in earning further fortunes in foreign trade, he requested to obtain lands in the coastal domains of Izumo Province, which possessed high quality harbors, in recognition of his past service against the Mōri and other clans of Kyūshū. However, his request was denied, as Izumo had already been given to the Mōri as a part of the truce agreements between the Mōri and Hideyoshi. Korenori then asked for the Ryukyu Islands instead; a paper fan inscribed with the date, Hideyoshi's signature, and the title \\"Kamei, Lord of Ryukyu\\" (亀井琉球の守, Kamei Ryūkyū no kami), found by Korean forces on a ship captured during Hideyoshi's invasions of Korea serves as evidence that Hideyoshi at least nominally offered the post to Korenori.Kerr, George H. (2000). Okinawa: the History of an Island People, pp. 151–152. However, Hideyoshi had no rightful claim to the islands, which were at the time the independent Ryūkyū Kingdom. Korenori sent a small force to take control of the islands, but was blocked by the Shimazu clan of Satsuma Province, who jealously guarded a special relationship, including exclusive trading rights, with the kingdom. Korenori was thus unable to wield any actual claim or control over the islands, and following Hideyoshi's death in 1598, entered the service of Tokugawa Ieyasu. Following the Sekigahara Campaign of 1600, his income was raised from 13,000 to 43,000 koku as a reward for his service to the Tokugawa clan. Korenori died of natural causes in 1612. Korenori's descendants were eventually made daimyō (lords) of the Tsuwano Domain, which they ruled until the Meiji Restoration (1868).

The history of the Jews in Ústí nad Labem in the Czech Republic dates back to 1848, following the emancipation of Austrian Jews. The greatest expansion achieved owing to presence of two significant families (Weinman and Petschek), who contributed to city development, at the end of 19th and at the beginning of 20th century. Two following dictatorships had devastating effect on the community. Most Jews fled prior to or during World War II. In November 1938, after the Munich Agreement, the few Jews that remained in Ústí were sent to extermination camps. [ Encyclopaedia Judaica. © 2008 ]  19th century and pre-war history  After Austrian emancipation, Jews were free to live in Ústí without facing residence restrictions. Four families from nearby Teplice were the first Jews to settle in the city, and a prayer house was opened not long after. The community did not become officially organized until 1863, and it was recognized by the authorities in 1869. The Jewish cemetery was consecrated in 1866, and then closed in 1893 when the Jewish community was given a section in the general cemetery. In 1880, thirty Jewish families came together to found a synagogue, and its opening ceremony was attended by other nearby Jewish communities and local non-Jewish officials. In 1910, the Jewish community numbered 2,000. World War I brought more Jews to Ústí, mainly refugees from Galicia. The local Jewish community did not welcome them with open arms or want them to stay, and instead gave them money to move somewhere else. After the war, the newly established Republic of Czechoslovakia acknowledged Jews as a national minority, with the rights that go along with it. Jews in Ústí mostly spoke German prior to the rise of Czech nationalism and culture. In 1921, the Jewish population was 976. Zionism also took root in the Ústí Jewish community after Czech independence. The Zionist student organization founded by Theodor Herzl opened a branch in the city in 1911. In 1919, a plethora of other Zionist organizations set up in the city, including a Maccabi sports club, Blau Weiss hiking society, and the Women's International Zionist Organization (WIZO). That year, at the first Zionist conference in Prague, a doctor from Ústí was elected to the central committee of Zionist organizations. In 1926, a number of Ústí Jews purchased membership and voting rights prior to the 15th Zionist Congress, and in 1937, 134 members of the Ústí community voted in the 20th Zionist Congress. During the 1930s, a training center for youth preparing to move to Mandatory Palestine was established, and about 20 youth from Ústí made aliyah and became pioneers. Also in this time, an increasing amount of the community declared their nationality as Jewish. A notable Jewish figure in the city was Viktor Ullmann, who was the opera conductor. In 1930, the Jewish population of the city was 985, and after the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany, many Jew in the community began to emigrate.  World War II and the Holocaust  In September 1938, the Munich Agreement dissolved the Republic of Czechoslovakia and annexed Ústí and the Sudeten Region into Nazi Germany. Much of the Jewish community fled to Latvia, Slovakia, other parts of Europe, or to North America. Some Ústí Jews fought with the Czech Army. In 1939, the synagogue was burnt down. After, the remaining Jews in the city were sent to a deserted palace in the mountain town of Schoenwald-Krasny. A printer with the last name Levi was chosen as the community's leader. They then began forced labor, and after a period of six weeks, the women were sent back to Ústí while the men were sent to Oranienburg. Ultimately, they were all sent to the Theresienstadt ghetto and then concentration or death camps, where most were killed in the Holocaust.  Post-war  Religious intolerance continued even after the war and that is other reason why many of the members of this community emigrated afterwards. Still, after the Soviet annexation of Carpatho-Rus, many Jews chose to move here. This population established a new Ústí synagogue in 1948 with 800 members. As of the early 21st century, the congregation continued to exist. There were changes in religious freedoms after 1989. Members of the community meet regularly during worships, especially during Jewish festivals. Still, life in the community is declining, particularly because of absence of young generation. There were 50 members of the community in 2000, of which 17 lived in Ústí nad Labem. There were 38 recorded members of the community in half of 2005. The contemporary chairman is Bedřich Heller.

The station is licensed to Lee's Summit, and broadcasts at 55,000 watts with a transmitter located in east Kansas City, Missouri. History =KCSX (1998–2003)= Originally, KCSX was a country music station based in Moberly, Missouri. In 1998, First Broadcasting moved the station's transmitter and target area to Kansas City, who sold half of ownership of the station to Union Broadcasting. This was a rare occasion where two companies shared programming of one radio station. In 2002, the station moved their transmitter further into the Kansas City market, causing two stations in Kansas to change frequencies (Topeka- based WIBW-FM moved from 97.3 to 94.5, while Junction City station KJCK-FM moved from 94.5 to 97.5). =KZPL The Planet (2003–2005)= On January 20, 2003, the station dropped its country music format and began stunting by playing nothing but songs by The Beatles for one week, followed by similar daylong marathons of music from The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, U2, Aerosmith, Van Halen, and Metallica. At Midnight on February 10, the new adult album alternative format known as \\"The Planet\\" debuted, with \\"The World I Know\\" by Collective Soul being the first song played.\\"Beatles format signals new things in the air\\", The Kansas City Star, January 22, 2003.Mark Davis, Tim Engle, \\"Take note\\", The Kansas City Star, February 11, 2003.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2003/RR-2003-02-14.pdf For the first month, all programming was fed via satellite from Dallas. Dubbed as \\"World Class Rock\\", KZPL gathered a small yet devoted following. However, it sat consistently near the bottom of most ratings charts throughout its two-year existence, namely due to numerous format tweaks. In Spring 2003, arguments between both ownership companies resulted in First Broadcasting taking Union Broadcasting to court, eventually leading to the full sale of the station to Union. =MAX-FM (2005–2007)= On September 16, 2005, after playing \\"Last Goodbye\\" by Jeff Buckley, KZPL flipped to Album Rock as \\"97-3 Max FM\\", which started with \\"For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)\\" by AC/DC.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2005/RR-2005-09-23.pdf 97.3 Max FM - 16 September, 2005 - Aircheck of 45 minutes after debut of Max FM The letters KCXM were implemented November 2, 2005. Since its sign on, \\"Max FM\\" used the \\"Everything That Rocks\\" slogan. A few days after the sign on, rival classic rocker KYYS began using exactly the same slogan, but quickly phased it out. KCXM was registered with Arbiton to use the slogan. As a rock station, KCXM never garnered the ratings Union had hoped for, and also struggled to make money. Just days before the format change, program director Bryan Truta announced he was leaving for rival station KCJK. \\"Max FM\\" competed against longtime FM rock stations KQRC, KYYS and KCFX. Kansas City native Erich \\"Mancow\\" Muller's Chicago-based morning show, Mancow's Morning Madhouse, aired weekdays from 5 a.m. to 10 a.m. The station added DJs in September 2006 as part of the celebration of the station being on air for one year. Murphy Wells (formerly of KQRC) did middays, Kenny Holland and Ozone did afternoons as \\"KAOS\\", and Scooter did nights. The station also added the syndicated program \\"Rockline\\" and retained \\"Little Steven's Underground Garage\\" from its AAA days. =ESPN Radio 97.3 (2007)= On January 4, 2007, after playing \\"Selling the Drama\\" by Live, KCXM dropped the rock format and became \\"ESPN Radio 97.3,\\" a full-time affiliate of ESPN Radio.Jeffrey Flanagan, \\"FM station switching to sports programming\\", The Kansas City Star, January 4, 2007. The station dropped all local hosts at this time, but continued to air local games and play by play. KCXM complimented its sister station, WHB, which carries a mostly local sports talk format. KCXM broadcast Kansas City Brigade games and Kansas City Royals evening games when sister station WHB was confined to its nighttime pattern. On November 30, 2007, KCXM was sold to EMF Broadcasting for $16 million. At midnight on December 1, 2007, KCXM began broadcasting K-LOVE programming. Just before the launch of K-LOVE, 97.3 reverted to its AAA format as \\"The Planet\\" for a few hours. =KLRX= On December 20, 2007, KCXM changed its callsign to KLRX, completing the transition. However, KLRX aired several sports events after the change to K-LOVE: a college basketball game between Kansas State and Oklahoma and at least one UMKC basketball game. It is likely that these games were \\"farmed out\\" from WHB, due to a schedule conflict. Once the sale was completed, the station ceased airing sporting events. EMF Broadcasting has its Kansas City office on the first floor of the Union Broadcasting Building in Overland Park, Kansas.

The biomass or protein extract from pure or mixed cultures of algae, yeasts, fungi or bacteria may be used as an ingredient or a substitute for protein-rich foods, and is suitable for human consumption or as animal feeds. Industrial agriculture is marked by a high water footprint, high land use, biodiversity destruction, general environmental degradation and contributes to climate change by emission of a third of all greenhouse gases, production of SCP does not necessarily exhibit any of these serious drawbacks. As of today, SCP is commonly grown on agricultural waste products, and as such inherits the ecological footprint and water footprint of industrial agriculture. However, SCP may also be produced entirely independent of agricultural waste products through autotrophic growth. Thanks to the high diversity of microbial metabolism, autotrophic SCP provides several different modes of growth, versatile options of nutrients recycling, and a substantially increased efficiency compared to crops. With the world population reaching 9 billion by 2050, there is strong evidence that agriculture will not be able to meet demand and that there is serious risk of food shortage. Autotrophic SCP represents options of fail-safe mass food-production which can produce food reliably even under harsh climate conditions. History In 1781, processes for preparing highly concentrated forms of yeast were established. Research on Single Cell Protein Technology started a century ago when Max Delbrück and his colleagues found out the high value of surplus brewer’s yeast as a feeding supplement for animals. During World War I and World War II, yeast-SCP was employed on a large scale in Germany to counteract food shortages during the war. Inventions for SCP production often represented milestones for biotechnology in general: for example, in 1919, Sak in Denmark and Hayduck in Germany invented a method named, “Zulaufverfahren”, (fed-batch) in which sugar solution was fed continuously to an aerated suspension of yeast instead of adding yeast to diluted sugar solution once (batch). In post war period, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) emphasized on hunger and malnutrition problems of the world in 1960 and introduced the concept of protein gap, showing that 25% of the world population had a deficiency of protein intake in their diet. It was also feared that agricultural production would fail to meet the increasing demands of food by humanity. By the mid 60’s, almost quarter of a million tons of food yeast were being produced in different parts of the world and Soviet Union alone produced some 900,000 tons by 1970 of food and fodder yeast. In the 1960s, researchers at British Petroleum developed what they called \\"proteins-from-oil process\\": a technology for producing single-cell protein by yeast fed by waxy n-paraffins, a byproduct of oil refineries. Initial research work was done by Alfred Champagnat at BP's Lavera Oil Refinery in France; a small pilot plant there started operations in March 1963, and the same construction of the second pilot plant, at Grangemouth Oil Refinery in Britain, was authorized. The term SCP was coined in 1966 by Carroll L. Wilson of MIT. The \\"food from oil\\" idea became quite popular by the 1970s, with Champagnat being awarded the UNESCO Science Prize in 1976, (May have moved to http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001111/111158E.pdf ) and paraffin-fed yeast facilities being built in a number of countries. The primary use of the product was as poultry and cattle feed. The Soviets were particularly enthusiastic, opening large \\"BVK\\" (belkovo-vitaminny kontsentrat, i.e., \\"protein-vitamin concentrate\\") plants next to their oil refineries in Kstovo (1973) Soviet Plant to Convert Oil to Protein for Feed; Use of Yeast Involved, By THEODORE SHABAD. the New York Times, November 10, 1973. RusVinyl – Summary of Social Issues (EBRD) Первенец микробиологической промышленности (Microbiological industry's first plant), in: Станислав Марков (Stanislav Markov) «Кстово – молодой город России» (Kstovo, Russia's Young City) and Kirishi (1974). KIRISHI: A GREEN SUCCESS STORY? (Johnson's Russia List, Dec. 19, 2002) The Soviet Ministry of Microbiological Industry had eight plants of this kind by 1989. However, due to concerns of toxicity of alkanes in SCP and pressured by the environmentalist movements, the government decided to close them down, or convert to some other microbiological processes. Quorn is a range of vegetarian and vegan meat-substitutes made from Fusarium venenatum mycoprotein, sold in Europe and North America. Another type of single cell protein-based meat analogue (which does not use fungi however but rather bacteriaEOS, april 2019, page 52) is Calysta. Production Process Single- cell proteins develop when microbes ferment waste materials (including wood, straw, cannery, and food-processing wastes, residues from alcohol production, hydrocarbons, or human and animal excreta). With 'electric food' processes the inputs are electricity, CO2 and trace minerals and chemicals such as fertiliser. The problem with extracting single-cell proteins from the wastes is the dilution and cost. They are found in very low concentrations, usually less than 5%. Engineers have developed ways to increase the concentrations including centrifugation, flotation, precipitation, coagulation, and filtration, or the use of semi-permeable membranes. The single-cell protein must be dehydrated to approximately 10% moisture content and/or acidified to aid in storage and prevent spoilage. The methods to increase the concentrations to adequate levels and the de-watering process require equipment that is expensive and not always suitable for small-scale operations. It is economically prudent to feed the product locally and soon after it is produced. Microorganisms Microbes employed include: * Yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  Pichia pastoris  Candida utilis  Torulopsis corallina  Geotrichum candidum * Fungi (Mycoprotein)  Aspergillus oryzae  Fusarium venenatum  Sclerotium rolfsii  Polyporus  Trichoderma  Scytalidium acidophilum * Bacteria  Rhodobacter capsulatus * Algae  spirulina (dietary supplement)  Chlorella Properties Large-scale production of microbial biomass has many advantages over the traditional methods for producing proteins for food or feed. # Microorganisms have a much higher growth rate (algae: 2–6 hours, yeast: 1–3 hours, bacteria: 0.5–2 hours). This also allows to select for strains with high yield and good nutritional composition quickly and easily compared to breeding. # Whereas large parts of the crop, such as stems, leaves and roots are not edible, single-cell microorganisms can be used entirely. Whereas parts of the edible fraction of crops contains is undigestible, many microorganisms are digestible at a much higher fraction. # Microorganisms usually have a much higher protein content of 30–70% in the dry mass than vegetables or grains. The amino acid profiles of many SCP microorganisms often have excellent nutritional quality, comparable to a hen's egg. # Some microorganisms can build vitamins and nutrients which eukaryotic organisms such as plants cannot produce or not produce in significant amounts, including vitamin B12. # Microorganisms can utilize a broad spectrum of raw materials as carbon sources including alkanes, methanol, methane, ethanol and sugars. What was considered \\"waste product\\" often can be reclaimed as nutrients and support growth of edible microorganisms. # Like plants, autotrophic microorganisms are capable to grow on CO2. Some of them, such as bacteria with the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway or the reductive TCA can fix CO2 between 2-3, up to 10 times more efficiently than plants when also considering the effects of photoinhibition. # Some bacteria, such as several homoacetogenic clostridia are capable to perform syngas fermentation. This means they can metabolize synthesis gas, a gas mixture of CO, H2 and CO2 that can be made by gasification of residual intractable biowastes such as lignocellulose. # Some bacteria are diazotrophic, i.e. they can fix N2 from the air and are thus independent of chemical N-fertilizer, whose production, utilization and degradation causes tremendous harm to the environment, deteriorates public health, and fosters climate change. # Many bacteria can utilize H2 for energy supply, using enzymes called hydrogenases. Whereas hydrogenases are normally highly O2-sensitive, some bacteria are capable of performing O2-dependent respiration of H2. This feature allows autotrophic bacteria to grow on CO2 without light at a fast growth rate. Since H2 can be made efficiently by water electrolysis, in a manner of speaking, those bacteria can be \\"powered by electricity\\". # Microbial biomass production is independent of seasonal and climatic variations, and can be easily shielded from extreme weather events that are expected to cause crop failures with the ongoing climate-change. Light-independent microorganisms such as yeasts can continue to grow at night. # Cultivation of microorganisms generally has a much lower water footprint than agricultural food production. Whereas the global average blue-green water footprint (irrigation, surface, ground and rain water) of crops reaches about 1800 liters per kg crop due to evaporation, transpiration, drainage and runoff, closed bioreactors producing SCP exhibits none of these causes. # Cultivation of microorganisms does not require fertile soil and therefore does not compete with agriculture. Thanks to the low water requirements, SCP cultivation can even be done in dry climates with infertile soil and may provide a means of fail-safe food supply in arid countries. # Photosynthetic microorganisms can reach a higher solar-energy-conversion efficiency than plants, because in photobioreactors supply of water, CO2 and a balanced light distribution can be tightly controlled. # Unlike agricultural products which are processed towards a desired quality, it is easier with microorganisms to direct production towards a desired quality. Instead of extracting amino acids from soy beans and throwing away half of the plant body in the process, microorganisms can be genetically modified to overproduce or even secrete a particular amino acid. However, in order to keep a good consumer acceptance, it is usually easier to obtain similar results by screening for microorganisms which already have the desired trait or train them via selective adaptation. Although SCP shows very attractive features as a nutrient for humans, however there are some problems that deter its adoption on global basis: * Fast growing microorganisms such as bacteria and yeast have a high concentration of nucleic acid, notably RNA. Levels must be limited in the diets of monogastric animals to <50 g per day. Ingestion of purine compounds arising from RNA breakdown leads to increased plasma levels of uric acid, which can cause gout and kidney stones. Uric acid can be converted to allantoin, which is excreted in urine. Nucleic acid removal is not necessary from animal feeds but is from human foods. A temperature hold at 64 °C inactivates fungal proteases and allows . However, this problem can be remediated. One common method consists in a heat treatment which kills the cells, inactivates proteases and allows endogenous RNases to hydrolyse RNA with release of nucleotides from cell to culture broth. * Similar to plant cells, the cell wall of some microorganisms such as algae and yeast contain non-digestible components, such as cellulose. The cells of some kind of SCP should be broken up in order to liberate the cell interior and allow complete digestion. * Some kind of SCP exhibits unpleasant color and flavors. * Depending on the kind of SCP and the cultivation conditions, care must be taken to prevent and control contamination by other microorganisms because contaminants may produce toxins such as mycotoxins or cyanotoxins. An interesting approach to address this problem was proposed with the fungus Scytalidium acidophilum which grows at a pH as low as 1. This allows to hydrolyse paper wastes to a sugar medium and creates aseptic conditions at low-cost. * Some yeast and fungal proteins tend to be deficient in methionine.

Outing clubs provide their members with the planning, training, access, and equipment necessary to enjoy these activities.  Origins  Some students' unions began planning wilderness outings in the late nineteenth century in response to the early American conservation movement.Webb 2001, pg. 42. In 1909, students at New Hampshire's Dartmouth College organized a club around such outings, with a particular emphasis on winter sports.Allen 1996, pp. 75-76 National Geographic published an articleHarris 1920, pp. 151–164. about a Dartmouth Outing Club skiing trip in 1920, and the following spring saw a 300 percent increase in applications for admission to the college.Allen 1996, pg. 78. By 1932, 14 outing clubs had been founded at universities in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. These 14 clubs formed the Intercollegiate Outing Club Association (IOCA) to organize multi-club excursions.Webb 2001, pg. 46. These clubs were based on the model established at Dartmouth, although similar groups had existed since at least 1888. Outing clubs were especially popular before and during World War II. They offered a way for students to find transportation at a time when few had cars and when gasoline was rationed.Webb 2001, pg. 48. Because many of these clubs were at single-sex schools, IOCA outings were a popular way for members to meet students of the opposite sex.Webb 2001, pp. 42, 43, 50. According to Dr. E. John B. Allen of the New England Ski Museum, collegiate outing clubs played an important role in promoting and modernizing skiing in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s.Allen 1996, pg. 117.  Activities  An outing club participates in a variety of outdoor recreational activities. The specific activities depend on the club and may range from wilderness exploration (such as climbing, hiking, and canoeing) to more \\"extreme\\" sports such as snowboarding and hang gliding.Webb 2001, pg. 40. Clubs typically provide gear and training for new members to help them participate safely.Webb 2001, pg. 49. Outing clubs often promote conservation through educational events or by participating in service projects, such as building or maintaining cabins or trails.Webb 2001, pp. 44, 45, 49. Singing and square dancing were also important outing club activities in the past, but this is less common today.Webb 2001, pp. 47, 49.  Organization  Like other student societies, outing clubs are usually run and chartered by students of a college or university along with an advisor. Equipment and fees are funded by membership dues, shared trip costs, or donations.Webb 2001, pg. 50. Clubs tend to use a \\"common adventure\\" model, with democratic group decision-making and little bureaucracy. A trip may or may not have a designated facilitator or leader to enforce safety or legal guidelines.

The Gophers were National Champions in his freshman and sophomore years. He enlisted in the United States Navy in 1943 and was assigned to the V-12 Navy College Training Program at the University of Michigan. He played football for the Wolverines in 1943 where he rushed for 817 yards in just six games before being reassigned by the Navy. Based on his performance in 1943, he was named an All-American and finished sixth in the Heisman Trophy voting. Daley has the unique status of having played in and won Little Brown Jug games for both Minnesota and Michigan, compiling a record of 4-0 in those contests. After active service in the Pacific Theater during World War II, Daley played professional football for three years in the All-America Football Conference with the Brooklyn Dodgers (1946), the Miami Seahawks (1946), the Chicago Rockets (1947), and the New York Yankees (1948). He later was one of the radio announcers for Minnesota Golden Gophers football for ten years and for the Minnesota Vikings when they first arrived in Minnesota. Beginning in 1973, he owned and operated the Daley Illustration Gallery in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota. Early years Daley was born and raised in Melrose, Minnesota. After graduating from high school in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Daley moved to Chicago, Illinois to pursue a career as a boxer. Daley attended DePaul University in Chicago, where he met a track and field coach who persuaded him to pursue football. University of Minnesota Daley enrolled at the University of Minnesota where he played football from 1940-1942. He played on two National Championship teams at Minnesota in 1940 and 1941, and the Gophers narrowly missed a third national championship in 1942. The Gophers beat Michigan in the Little Brown Jug game all three years Daley played there. In 1940, the Gophers beat Tom Harmon's Wolverines 7-6. Harmon missed an extra point that cost Michigan the game. University of Michigan After the 1942 season, Daley enlisted in the United States Navy. Because of his college background, Daley was selected to attend a midshipman academy at Columbia University in New York City. He was ordered to report to the University of Michigan because it had a V-12 Navy College Training Program. He stayed in Ann Arbor for only six months while waiting for an opening in the program at Columbia. While in Ann Arbor, recruits were required to remain in good physical shape and were given two choices: either participate in Navy fitness classes or work out with the Michigan football team. Michigan's football coach Fritz Crisler took advantage of the opportunity and convinced Daley to play for his football team, as Daley had one year of eligibility remaining. He played for Michigan in 1943 where he was the nation's fourth best groundgainer despite playing in only six games. Daley's speed and power helped the Wolverines tie Purdue for the Big Ten Conference title. Daley averaged 6.8 yards per carry and scored nine touchdowns. He carried the ball 120 times, rushed for 817 yards and added another 119 yards on six punt returns. In addition to his six touchdowns, he kicked three extra points, for a total of 57 points scored. His best game came on October 2, 1943 at Evanston, Illinois, as Michigan beat Northwestern, 21-7 win. In that game, Daley gained 216 yards and scored two touchdowns in 26 carries. In his final college football game, he helped the Wolverines win back the Little Brown Jug that he had helped the Gophers secure from 1940-1942. He holds the distinction of being the only player to win Little Brown Jug games playing for both Minnesota and Michigan. Asked at the time about having the opportunity to battle for the Little Brown Jug from the other side of the fence, Daley denied having qualms about playing his former teammates: \\"It will have to be just another game. I look at it just as though it were an intrasquad scrimmage. There won't be any qualms about how hard I hit my teammates or how hard they hit me.\\" He did note, though, that he wanted his last college football game to be memorable: \\"If this is going to be my last game, I'd really like it to be one I can remember.\\" Daley later recalled the significance of the Little Brown Jug in the years he played: \\"We were always told to never lose this game. Winning the Little Brown Jug was very important to us. Fortunately I was able to go 4-0 in Little Brown Jug games while playing for both teams.\\" Daley recalled that it was strange playing against his former Gopher teammates in the 1943 Jug game: \\"It was strange as I was playing against my teammates and friends, but I think it was the idea of winning the Little Brown Jug that motivated me. We beat Minnesota 49-6 and the Jug came to Michigan. It was a wild story.\\" The Michigan victory snapped a nine-game losing streak to the Gophers. In addition to Daley, the 1943 Michigan team also benefited from the arrival of another wartime transfer, Pro Football Hall of Famer Elroy \\"Crazy Legs\\" Hirsch from Wisconsin. The press referred to Daley and Hirsch as \\"a pair of 'lend-lease' satellites.\\" He was named an All-American by the Associated Press and Collier's/Grantland Rice, and he finished seventh in the Heisman Trophy voting. When Daley was named an All-American along with Otto Graham in the backfield, one reporter referred to Daley as \\"Minnesota's gift to Michigan by way of the Navy V-12 class.\\" The article noted that Daley was a speedster who could run 100 yards in 10 seconds. He gained 817 yards in just six games before being moved elsewhere by the Navy. Though he never planned to play for Michigan, Daley looked back on the opportunity as a stroke of luck. \\"I was a lucky guy. I got to play for two great schools, but playing at Michigan was one of the greatest thrills I could have had. When I was at Michigan, I was the happiest guy in the world.\\" Asked what it means to have played an important part in the football traditions at both Minnesota and Michigan, Daley said: \\"It means a lot to me. Both programs have been so wonderful to me long after I played. I am a member of both Hall of Fames and that is very special.\\" Daley said his one disappointment about his college football career was that he never played on a team that beat Notre Dame. In 1943 Michigan lost to Notre Dame, 35-12. Despite 135 yards on 24 carries by Daley (the most yards gained on Notre Dame by any back in 1943), Michigan suffered its only loss to Notre Dame. Said Daley, \\"I wanted to beat them so bad, and I played one of the best games of my life, but it wasn't to be.\\" In 1983, A Century of All Americans chose Daley as one of the All Time Football Fullbacks. In 2005 Daley was selected as one of the 100 greatest Michigan football players of all time by the \\"Motown Sports Revival,\\" ranking 63rdt on the all-time team. Military service After spending six months in Ann Arbor, Daley went on to Columbia University where he was a Regimental Commander for Columbia University's Naval unit. After graduating from midshipman school, Daley went to Florida for amphibious training. He was on his way to the Pacific Theater when the war ended in August 1945. He remained overseas for a time, and played in an Army-Navy football game in Shanghai, China. Professional football Daley was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers as the seventh overall selection of the 1943 NFL Draft, but he never played for the team. After the war, Daley signed a $30,000 contract to play professional football in the new All-America Football Conference. He played four seasons with the Brooklyn Dodgers, the Miami Seahawks the Chicago Rockets, and New York Yankees. Daley recalled that football players \\"didn't get paid much during those days, but did it for the love of the game.\\" In comparing college and professional football in the 1940s, Daley noted: \\"I think most of us enjoyed the college days better.\\" Daley's best season in professional football was 1947, when he played with Chicago. He played in 14 games for the Rockets and had 633 yards of total offense: 447 yards rushing (including a 52-yard run) in 121 carries; 116 yards receiving on 12 catches; and 70 yards passing with three completions in six passes. Broadcasting career Following a career in professional football, Daley returned to the University of Minnesota and got his degree in education. He spent ten years in the broadcast booth for the Minnesota Golden Gophers with Dick Enroth and Ray Christensen. He also did a few years of color analysis on radio broadcasts of the Minnesota Vikings when the franchise began in the early 1960s. Daley Illustration Gallery Nicollet Mall on a Saturday morning Daley had always been passionate about art, but according to Daley, he \\"never had the talent to paint or draw at a high level.\\" He became an art collector. In the early 1970s, Daley and his wife, Melba, opened their first studio. In approximately 1974, they then opened the Daly Illustration Art Gallery in the Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown Minneapolis. From 1974 until his death, Daley has owned and operated Daley Illustration Gallery located in the Hyatt Regency Hotel, 1300 Nicollet Mall in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Daley Illustration Gallery has 500 original illustrations, making it one of the finest illustration painting collections in the world. In a 1993 interview, Daley said, \\"Some people just come in to talk football, but don't know much about painting.\\" Personal life Daley married his wife, Melba, in 1972. He died on October 19, 2015 at the age of 96.http://www.startribune.com/obituaries/detail/106076/?fullname=william- edward-daley See also * List of Michigan Wolverines football All-Americans References ;Sources * Bentley Library profile and photograph of Daley * Gopherhole Profile and Interview with Daley, 2005 * Jim Cnockaert, Michigan: Where Have You Gone (Sports Publishing 2004), pp. 46–49.

It is a 1/3 mile asphalt track that is used for stock car racing. The track has hosted races featuring the ARTGO Challenge Series, the NASCAR AutoZone Elite Division, Midwest Series, the ASA Midwest Tour, the Mid-American Stock Car Series, the Wisconsin Challenge Series, and the Must See Racing.com Xtreme Sprint Car Series. The track, which opened in 1958, sits on of land. The track closed during the middle of the 2006 season over a bank fraud case, but the track was purchased during the following off-season by a group of three investors that included NASCAR driver and Dells area native Frank Kreyer. It reopened in 2007. Howard Johnson, one of the original track owners, like to call the track \\"Home of the Biggies\\". The track has a reputation of being \\"what a short track should be.\\" Dick Trickle described driving the track, \\"You drop low in the corners and then drift high on the straights. You try to make the track into the roundest oval possible.\\" Track shutdown in 2006 Bryan Severson, the owner of 5 County Towing in Reedsburg, bought the track from then owner Luke Herring in 2002. During the 2006 season, the track was having financial difficulties with paying the drivers, and by mid-July Severson shut down the track after his arrest on federal charges of bank fraud. Further investigation found that in 2002 and 2003, Severson had received bank loans from Mark Hardyman, the president of the First National Bank of Blanchardville, and used his towing business and Dells Raceway Park as collateral. To cover up the loans from the bank's board of directors, Severson had written several worthless checks worth millions of dollars. The bank eventually did collapse in 2003. Severson was sentenced in February 2008 to nearly 12 years in federal prison after being convicted of 28 felony counts. Severson was ordered to repay the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation about $6.4 million that he was responsible for in the intended loss to the bank, less about $700,000 the FDIC received from another bank that bought some of Severson's loans which used the track as collateral. Lyle Nabbefeldt Memorial and special events On May 26, 1973 Wisconsin Rapids driver Lyle Nabbefeldt lost control of his car entering turn one during time trials, crashed into the outside wall and was killed instantly. The Lyle Nabbefeldt Memorial began in 1974 as a tribute to the driver, and it became the Dells' annual marquee event until its last running in the late 1990s. The first running of the event was a 100-lap feature, but the feature format was changed the next year to running two 55-lap features with an overall champion being declared. The change was made to reflect the number 55s that Nabbefeldt ran throughout his racing career. Another unique part of the Nabbefeldt Memorial was the winner's trophy, known as the Nabbefeldt Traveling Trophy. The overall champion of the Nabbefeldt Memorial was allowed to keep the trophy until the following year's running of the race. If any one driver was able to win the Nabbefeldt Memorial three years in a row, that driver would take permanent possession of the trophy and a new one would be introduced. Dick Trickle won the event two years in a row on two occasions, but Rick Wateski is the only driver to have won the event three years in a row (1991/1992/1993). Wayne Lensing, the current owner of Dells Raceway Park, announced that The Nabbefeldt Memorial was being revived for 2015, as part of a series of CWRA Challenge Series races. The track also announced two new marquee Super Late Model events in 2015. The first event was the Icebreaker 100, an event held in April before other tracks opened. The second event was the Falloween 150, which was held in late October after all other late model events in the state of Wisconsin had concluded.

In conjunction with an area Baptist church, they have built twelve houses since 1995. *Society of St. Vincent de Paul Assistance Center - building containing items for sale for the benefit of the poor History Holy Name of Jesus began as a mission parish of the Ascension Catholic Church in Eau Gallie. On Christmas Eve, 1959, the first Mass was celebrated by Father Martin B. Power, founding Pastor of Ascension as well as the mission parish in Canova Beach, across the street from where HNJ now resides. The Christmas Eve Mass was celebrated in an unfinished house in Indian Harbour Beach. Bishop Joseph P. Hurley, of St. Augustine, affectionately known as \\"Ten Acres Joe\\" by his priests, for his farsighted policy of buying all over Florida for future parish sites, had purchased in 1965, just south of the Eau Gallie Boulevard. In a letter dated January 1961, the pastor informed the Archbishop that the property was land- locked with no right of way on Highway A1A so an additional adjoining property was purchased in June, 1961, with a frontage on A1A. Ground was broken for a provisional church on September 9, 1962. The church had a seating capacity of 480 and included a . hall. Archbishop Hurley dedicated the church and hall in March 1963. There were about 250 families in the church then. Land had been purchased for the expansion of the mission, which was to include a school and convent. Technically, Holy Name remained a mission of Ascension parish until May 1968 when the first pastor of Holy Name was appointed by William Donald Borders, the first bishop of Orlando. After 1969, the church purchased land with of frontage on A1A and adjacent to the existing church property. This property purchased in 1970 included the Greystone Apartments, which were converted to a rectory while the garage was converted into parish offices. Holy Name of Jesus then had approximately of beachside property. The provisional church built in 1963 became overcrowded so the church raised a million dollars in 1978 to build a permanent church with a seating capacity of approximately 850 people. The first Mass was celebrated in the new church on April 25, 1980. Bishop Thomas Grady, dedicated the church on October 26, 1980. In November, 1986, the first pastor was appointed pastor to the English speaking community of Our Savior Church in The Hague, Holland. The parish became computerized in 1988. The convent was converted into the Administration Center in 1988 for office space for the pastoral and lay staff. During 1987-88 a nationally known consultant on church process facilitated a parish wide consensus process called Vision 2000 in which parishioners decided on priorities, both in regard to ministry and facilities. This in turn, in 1989, led to the restructuring of the parish ministries into seven commissions which implemented the goals of the then newly formed Pastoral council. Also as a result of Vision 2000, a successful capital fund drive was conducted in the fall of ’88 to build an Education Center, a Parish Activity Center, a church organ, improved parking, drainage and traffic control, as well as sewer for the entire parish plant. By 1989 the parish membership had doubled from 1100 to 2200 registered families with an estimated 500 to 800 additional families not registered. Continuing into the 90’s new ministries were developed and new buildings were constructed. The HNJ School Board’s five-year plan, which included five new classrooms, was completed in time for the 1998-99 school year. The classroom building was constructed so that the rooms could be used by parish groups for evening meetings. A new rectory for the priests was completed in 1995. This freed up space in the old rectory for the expansion of the St. Vincent de Paul Society Assistance Center, renovation of the Outreach Thrift Store and the only one of its kind, a Christian Marriage and Family Counseling Center, staffed by professional counselors with appropriate credential and licensed by the State of Florida. Continued growth again presented the need for a larger worship space. On August 30–31, 1997, after fund raising and parish-style town meetings plans for a new church were underway. The pastor described HNJ’s move to the parish hall for weekend Masses during renovation and expansion of the church as \\"Back to our Roots.\\" Construction was completed of the renovated and expanded worship space, chapels and covered gathering space. The first Mass was celebrated August 23, 1998. Bishop Norbert Dorsey dedicated the church October 1998. Hurricane Jeanne destroyed the Parish Hall and damaged other structures in 2004. A subsequent $12 million fundraiser was successful and construction of a new hall and gym for the school was completed in 2008. Staff The parish has three priests, five permanent deacons, and six paid staff members, in addition to the school teaching staff. =Pastors= #Monsignor Martin B.

Greg, A List of English Plays Written before 1643 and Printed before 1700, London, The Bibliographical Society/Blades, East & Blades, 1900. * Walter Montague's masque The Shepherd's Paradise, 1659 * Sir Robert Stapylton's The Slighted Maid, 1663 * James Shirley's Love Tricks, 1667 (the 3rd edition) * Thomas Middleton and William Rowley's The Changeling, 1668 (2nd edition) * Thomas Tomkis's Albumazar, 1668 (5th edition). Other works Beyond the confines of drama, Dring issued volumes of poetry by John Harington, Sir Edward Sherburne, and Edward, Lord Herbert. In partnership again with Humphrey Moseley, Dring published Thomas Stanley's important 3-volume History of Philosophy (1655-61). Independently, Dring issued Stanley's edition of Claudius Aelianus (1665). Dring produced other books of serious nonfiction, including the anonymous and rather startlingly-titled Modern Policies, Taken from Machiavel, Borgia, and Other Choice Authors (1652). As was commonly done in his era, Dring sometimes partnered with other stationers for major projects (as with Moseley and Marriot, noted above). For Franz Schott's lavishly-illustrated Italy in Its Original Glory (1660), Dring worked with John Place and Henry Twyford; for César de Rochefort's History of the Caribby Islands (1666), Dring shared responsibility with John Starkey. Though he generally maintained a respectable reputation, Dring's career also showed a few of the questionable involvements that were common among the stationers of his era. In 1650 he published Robert Baron's Pocula Castalia. Baron was a notable plagiarist; his 1650 verse collection consisted mainly of the work of John Milton. In 1658 Dring published a work by \\"H. W.\\" called The Accomplish'd Courtier, an unacknowledged translation of Eustache de Refuge's Traicté de la Cour (1617).W. Lee Ustick, \\"The Courtier and the Bookseller: Some Vagaries of Seventeenth-Century Publishing,\\" Review of English Studies Vol. 5 No. 18 (April 1929), pp. 146-8. Dring's date of death is not known; his last will and testament was dated September 12, 1668, and was probated on December 21 of that year. He was survived by two sons, Thomas and Joshua.Henry Robert Plomer, A Dictionary of the Booksellers and Printers Who Were at Work in England, Scotland and Ireland from 1641 to 1667, London, The Bibliographical Society/Blades, East & Blades, 1907; p. 66. Dring the younger His son Thomas Dring the younger continued his father's business into the 1680s, \\"at the sign of the White Lion next Chancery Lane end, in Fleet Street.\\" Like his father, the younger Dring published law books and works on public affairs, plus plays and general literature. In a brief period in the 1670s the younger Dring issued a group of noteworthy play texts: * Aphra Behn's The Amorous Prince, 1671  and her The Dutch Lover, 1673 * The Rehearsal, by George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and others, 1672 * Edward Ravenscroft's The Citizen Turned Gentleman, 1672 * Henry Nevil Payne's The Fatal Journey, 1673  and his The Morning Ramble, also 1673 * William Wycherley's The Gentleman Dancing-Master, 1673 (partnered with Henry Herringman)  and his The Country Wife, 1675. In non-dramatic literature, the younger Dring's most notable book was arguably the 1673 second edition of Milton's shorter poems.

During the war, Göring boasted that he owned the largest private art collection in Europe.Petropoulos, Jonathan. Art As Politics in the Third Reich, University of North Carolina Press, 1999, p. 187.  World War II  Göring in captivity 9 May 1945 Lohse, who published a scholarly thesis on painter Jacob Philipp Hackert in 1936, worked as an art dealer in Berlin from 1936 to 1939, selling paintings out of his father's home. Having joined the SS in 1933,Günther Haase, Kunstraub und Kunstschutz: Eine Dokumentation, Hildesheim 1991, kurz Haase 1991 p. 95 Lohse became a member of the Nazi Party in 1937. He would eventually be drafted into Göring's Luftwaffe, then appointed by Göring to the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (ERR), Hitler's special art looting unit. Lohse arrived in Paris by November 1940 to help catalog the celebrated and eclectic collection of Alphonse Kann, which numbered 1,202 items.Feliciano, Hector. The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World's Greatest Art, Basic Books, 1997, p. 110. Though Lohse reported to Paris ERR chief Kurt von Behr (1890–1945), he enjoyed \\"special agent\\" status conferred on him by Göring. Among other privileges, Lohse was not required to wear a uniform for the nearly four years he lived in occupied Paris. As the ERR's Deputy Director in Paris from 1942 to 1944, Lohse helped supervise the systematic theft of at least 22,000 paintings and art objects in France, most of which were taken from Jewish families. Although Lohse set aside the most highly prized Old Masters for Hitler's Führer Museum (planned in Linz), he helped Göring develop his own enormous private art collection, which accumulated during the war at Göring's vast German estate, Carinhall. Between November 1940 and November 1942, Lohse staged 20 exhibitions of looted art for Hitler's second-in-command in the Jeu de Paume, from which Göring selected at least 594 pieces for his own collection.Petropoulos, Jonathan. Art As Politics in the Third Reich, University of North Carolina Press, 1999, p. 190. Lohse was awarded the War Merit Cross, 2nd class by Adolf Hitler because of his activities in art theft in Paris.  Interrogation and imprisonment  Lohse fled Paris in August 1944, and briefly served in one of Göring's safe Berlin regiments before travelling to Neuschwanstein Castle in February 1945, where a major cache of art looted in France (as well as the Rothschild family jewels) had been safely stored.Nicholas, Lynn. The Rape of Europa, Knopf, 1994, pp. 292, 341. Lohse was ordered by Robert Scholz to protect Nazi art holdings and records from destruction, and to \\"turn them over to the American authorities at such time as Füssen [a nearby town] might be occupied.\\"Petropoulos, Jonathan. The Faustian Bargain: The Art World In Nazi Germany, Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 139. Facing a possible death sentence for crimes witnessed in Paris by Rose Valland (and others), Lohse underwent a two-month interrogation, during which he shared a cell with two other notorious Nazi art looters, Karl Haberstock and Walter Hofer.Petropoulos, Jonathan. The Faustian Bargain, Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 94. The suicide of Baron Kurt von Behr proved to be a godsend to Lohse, permitting him to blame the systematic confiscation of French art collections on his former ERR chief in Paris.Feliciano, Hector. The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the World's Greatest Art, Basic Books, 1997, p. 168. Lohse cooperated with American occupiers and repeatedly traded his encyclopedic knowledge of the Nazi art trade for further leniency--he testified, for example, in the Nuremberg trials in November 1945, providing evidence against his superiors and professing a personal distaste for activities of the ERR. After being transferred from American to French custody in 1948, Lohse was acquitted in a 1950 military tribunal in Paris against some officials of the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg. Lohse never conceded responsibility for art looting, admitting only to possessing furniture stolen from deported Jewish families which Lohse had abandoned in his Paris apartment.  Later years  Although the conditions of Lohse's release forbade him ever to work again as an art dealer, German officials quietly allowed Lohse to resume his profession in Bavaria (Munich) in the early 1950s. An unrepentant Nazi, Lohse was among several former Nazi art dealers who, after the war, pressed their own restitution claims for work they claimed to have lost during the years of conflict.Nicholas, Lynn. The Rape of Europa, Knopf, 1994, p. 435. Lohse's legitimately acquired collection of Dutch old masters and Expressionist paintings was said to be valued in the \\"millions\\". Lohse's death in March 2007 was little-noticed, apparently because few realized one of the Third Reich's most notorious art looters was still alive.  Secret vault  In May 2007, the seizure of a secret Zurich bank vault registered to Schönart Anstalt (under Lohse's control since 1978) turned up a valuable Camille Pissarro painting stolen by the Gestapo from a prominent Jewish publisher in Vienna in 1938, as well as paintings of uncertain provenance by Monet and Renoir. According to U.S. historian and looted art expert Jonathan Petropoulos, who \\"got to know [Lohse] well\\" in the last decade of his life, the existence of the vault makes it \\"not only possible, but likely\\" that Lohse had sold looted artworks in recent decades. Painted in 1903 and the first in Pissarro's last series of Paris city views, \\"Le Quai Malaquais, Printemps\\" was restituted later in 2007 by a Liechtenstein court to an heir of Gottfried Bermann Fischer, and ultimately auctioned in November 2009 for $1,850,000 ($2,154,000 with Christie's premium) under its new title, \\"Le Quai Malaquais et l'Institut\\". European prosecutors seized documents confirming that at least 14 paintings left Lohse's safe since 1983, including paintings by Corot and Sisley as well as-yet-unnamed works by Dürer and Kokoschka, among others. An international investigation of Lohse's activities (as well as possible collusion with galleries and auction houses) was opened as of 2006 and currently involves three European countries: Germany, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein. According to widely accepted estimates, of the 600,000 artworks looted by the Nazis in World War II, up to 100,000 were destroyed or are still missing.

It was the home of the Toledo Mud Hens from July 3, 1909, until the club disbanded after the 1955 season. It was also home to a short-lived entry in the South-Michigan League in 1914. The park was named for Noah H. Swayne, Jr., the son of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Noah Haynes Swayne, who donated the land for the ballpark.\\"Swayne Field\\" , Toledo's Attic, accessed March 1, 2009 The double- decker ballpark replaced Armory Park. The main stand was built of steel and concrete, one of the first minor league ballparks not made primarily of wood. The ballpark was located on a block bounded by Monroe Street (southwest, first base), Detroit Avenue (southeast, right field), Council Street (northeast, left field) and railroad tracks (northwest, third base). Ground was broken on March 6, 1909, and the park opened on July 3. The opening game crowd got its money's worth, as the game went 18 innings, Columbus edging out Toledo 12-11. (Toledo Baseball Guide, p. 97) Field dimensions initially were down the left field line, to center field, and 327 to right field. The park initially held 11,800 spectators. 1928 expansion added 3,000 more seats. Inner bleachers cut the center field distance to 425. In 1945, an inner fence cut down the size of the left and center field areas further, to become more \\"home run friendly\\". With the Mud Hens calling this field their home for the better part of 46 years, this was the longest-lived of the many ballparks used for professional ball in Toledo. There were a few interruptions. The Mud Hens were transferred to Cleveland for 1914 and 1915 by their owner, who was also the owner of the Cleveland Indians. This was done to keep the Federal League at bay, by ensuring that there was a home game every day at Cleveland's League Park. Willys-Overland Field Day at Swayne Field, Toledo, Ohio Another team was placed in Toledo for 1914, as part of the South-Michigan League. The \\"Soumichers\\" or \\"Little Mud Hens\\" drew poorly and became strictly a road team for the second half of the season. There was no club in 1915. In 1916, the original Mud Hens transferred back from Cleveland, with the Fed having folded. The Mud Hens had little success over the years, and in mid-1952 the team transferred to Charleston, West Virginia. Another AA club transferred to Toledo for 1953, but after three seasons it left, and Swayne Field was demolished soon after. The Swayne Field Shopping Center now sits on the site. Much of the original left field wall still exists, forming a decaying barrier on the northeast edge of the block, facing Council Street. The revived Mud Hens would begin in 1965 at Lucas County Stadium in Maumee, Ohio, which had been remodeled specifically to attract baseball to Toledo again.

Ngaio railway station is one of eight railway stations on the Johnsonville Branch, a commuter branch railway north of Wellington in New Zealand’s North Island, and serves the suburb of Ngaio. The station was erected and operated by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company (WMR) on their line from Wellington to Longburn. The area served by this station used to be called Crofton, until the suburb was renamed to Ngaio in 1908 to avoid confusion with Crofton, a suburb of Marton in the Manawatu. From the acquisition of the WMR by the New Zealand Railways Department in 1908 until the opening of the Tawa Flat deviation in 1937, the station was on the North Island Main Trunk railway. On 2 July 1938 the truncated section of the line to Johnsonville became the Johnsonville Branch. Matangi electric multiple unit trains are operated by Tranz Metro under the Metlink brand through this station in both directions to Johnsonville (to the north) and Wellington (to the south).  History  Ngaio was one of three stations constructed by the Wellington and Manawatu Railway Company on what is now known as the Johnsonville Branch. It was opened on 21 September 1885 along with the first section of the company’s line between Wellington and Paramata. Timetabled services began several days later on the 24th. The station originally only had a single side platform, with the present-day second side platform and shelter being added at a later date. The points were manually controlled from a signal box at the southern end of the station into the 1960s, with this being one of the last such sections of the line before complete automation. In 2009 the loop was lengthened towards Wellington and the southbound platform was replaced and extended. Then the northbound platform was replaced and extended to enable the new Matangi EMUs to be used on the line. Other upgrades included new platform lighting, seating, and signage.  Operation  Passenger trains cross at this station as the Up-train platform is on a crossing loop. Runaway sidings are located at both the southern and northern ends of the station for Down and Up trains (respectively). Colour light signals are also located at both ends of the platforms. Part of the Ngaio railway station car park.  Services  Trains run in both directions through this station, departing at half-hourly intervals, supplemented by a 13/13/26 schedule at peak times on week days. The #26 bus route passes close by this station, along Ottawa Road and Crofton Road, at the end of Waikowhai Street.  Facilities  This station has dual side platforms with a passenger shelter on each. Access between the platforms is by way of at-grade pedestrian level crossings at one end of the platforms, the former access at both ends being removed during the recent extension of platform lengths. There is pedestrian access to Waikowhai Street from the Down train platform, and a car park off Collingwood Street, behind the Up train platform.

In 1980, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. The Bruce Mason Playwriting Award, one of the most important playwrighting accolades in New Zealand, is named in his honour. Mason was also an actor, critic, and fiction writer.Dictionary of New Zealand Biography - Mason, Bruce Edward George Mason's most well known play is The End of the Golden Weather, a classic work in New Zealand theatre which was made into a feature film directed by Ian Mune in 1991. Another significant play is The Pohutukawa Tree written during the 1950s and 1960s. The Pohutukawa Tree was Mason's first major success and explored Māori and Pākehā themes, a common thread in most of his works. Theatre was an avenue for Mason to highlight social and political issues in New Zealand society. He translated Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard for radio in 1960. His works of solo theatre was collected under the title Bruce Mason Solo (1981) and included The End of the Golden Weather. Published in 1987 was The Healing Arch, a cycle of five plays, including The Pohutukawa Tree and Hongi, which focus on Māori culture post European contact. Background Mason was born in Wellington, the country's capital. At the age of 5, his family moved to Takapuna. He attended Victoria University College where he took part in drama. In 1945, he graduated with a B.A. He served in the New Zealand Army (1941–1943) and the Naval Volunteer Reserve (1943–1945). He later worked for the New Zealand Forest Service (1951–1957). He edited the Māori news magazine Te Ao Hou (1960–1961), a culturally significant publication. He was a co-founder of Downstage Theatre, New Zealand's first professional theatre in 1964 and wrote a weekly column Music on the Air for the New Zealand Listener from 1964 to 1969. He was also a theatre critic for the capital's newspapers from the 1950s to the 1980s. Honours and awards In 1977, Mason was awarded an honorary Doctor of Literature degree by Victoria University of Wellington. In the 1980 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for services to literature and the arts. Personal life Mason met his wife Diana while studying at Victoria University College in 1939. A noted obstetrician specialising in women's health, she shared his interest in the arts. They had three children, Belinda, Julian and Rebecca. Death Bruce Mason died in 1982 from cancer. His wife Diana Mason died in June 2007, nearly 25 years after her husband's death. Legacy Mason's plays are studied at schools and universities. The Bruce Mason Centre, a major arts and theatre venue in Auckland is also named after him. The centre was opened in 1996 and contains a 1164-seat auditorium. The Promenade Cafe displays Bruce Mason memorabilia, including his original desk and typewriter.Bruce Mason Centre In 2009, The Pohutukawa Tree was staged by Auckland Theatre Company, directed by Colin McColl and starring Rena Owen and Stuart Devenie.

The Wisconsin Hoofers was begun in 1920 by a group of Norwegian exchange students who built a ski jump on the UW-Madison campus by Lake Mendota. The club was originally called the Badger Ski Club. Porter Butts, the first director of the Memorial Union (Wisconsin), was instrumental in establishing the Wisconsin Hoofers. The first Hoofers club, a skiing and outing club, was established in 1931, modeled after the Dartmouth Outing Club. The name \\"hoofers\\" is similar to the term \\"heelers\\" used for the new members of the Dartmouth club and reportedly was designed to imply \\"getting there under your own power.\\" In 1976 Hoofers listed over 5,600 members. The emblem of the club in its current form is the capital \\"W\\" overlaid by the horseshoe (which looks like \\"U\\", thus alluding to the \\"U of W\\").Wisconsin Hoofers website Hoofer Sailing Club Hoofer Badger sloops along Lake Mendota. The Hoofer Sailing Club operates at Memorial Union, on the south shoreline of Lake Mendota on the University of Wisconsin–Madison campus. It has a fleet of more than 120 boats, sailboards and kites. The club has around 1,000 members, but has had upwards of 1,500 members in the past. It is believed to be the second-largest inland sailing club in the country.Wisconsin Alumni Association Directory, Intro, p. xv, 2011 The club has a highly-active instruction program, with thousands of lessons each season taught by paid and volunteer staff. Members have free access to use equipment after they have completed their instruction and earned a certification. In the winter months, the club has on-land classes and a snow-kiting program. The club also hosts the University of Wisconsin undergraduate sailing team, nicknamed Wisco, which competes in the Intercollegiate Sailing Association. The sailing club originated in 1939 as an all-volunteer club whose members maintained boats and taught each other how to sail on wooden dinghies. Peter Barrett brought the first wooden Tech dinghy from M.I.T. in the 1950s, and it became the club's signature boat. Peter and Olaf Harken modified M.I.T.'s fiberglass Tech design with air tanks under the gunwales, so that a capsized boat could be righted and come up mostly dry, to create the Badger Tech dinghy. The two brothers founded their first company, Vanguard Sailboats, to construct a fleet of these boats. The club has expanded to sail fifteen types of craft today. The club's largest boat is Soma, a Mull 34 racing yacht painted to resemble a Holstein cow.Wisconsin Department of Transportation, State Highway Map, 2004 In 2003, it added a cruising sailing curriculum with the donation of Spray, a 30-foot cruising yacht, by a retired electrical engineering professor. The cruising program was very popular, and so in 2010, the club became an American Sailing Association-certified school. (There are charges in addition to the dues for ASA certifications and classes.) Hoofer Ski and Snowboard Club Originally started as the Badger Ski Club with three pairs of skis in 1931, the Ski and Snowboard club has grown to one of the largest clubs of its kind. The club plans a variety of ski and snowboard trips for University of Wisconsin students and union members, ranging from out west, Midwest, and local trips. It had been long-standing tradition that the club organize a 200+ person trip to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, during the university's spring break. The Club also includes an Alpine Racing Team, Nordic Team, and Freestyle Team. Several annual campus events are organized by the club such as the Rail Jam freestyle competition at Union South and ski and snowboard movie premieres. Since 1963 the club has hosted a ski and snowboard resale every December, which has grown to be the largest in the Midwest. At the resale the local community can buy and sell new or used ski and snowboard equipment. Hoofer Ski and Snowboard Club also offers lessons to those who would like to learn to ski or ride or would like to improve their skills. Hoofer Outing Club Founded in 1945, the Outing Club combines a number of outdoor pursuits under a single umbrella club. The Outing club is an all-volunteer, student-run organization, though members need not be affiliated with the UW. The Outing Club is active year- round, with Interest Groups in Caving, Road Cycling, Mountain Biking, Rock Climbing, Telemark Skiing, XC Skiing, Whitewater Paddling, Flatwater Paddling, and Hiking/Backpacking. The club owns a piece of undeveloped property referred to as \\"Hooferland\\" near Lakewood, WI, which it uses to stage various weekend trips throughout the year. The Outing Club was instrumental in developing the sport of whitewater paddling in Wisconsin in the 1960s, as it owned molds to build boats in its shop facilities in the basement of the Memorial Union. In the late 1970s, club member Gordy Sussman started a small outfit in his rental house near campus to make group purchases of paddles, and other equipment, to get discounts and save on shipping costs. He developed this operation into the Rutabaga Paddlesports shop, a successful local business that presents Canoecopia, claimed to be the world's largest paddlesports exposition.

Early life McKenzie was born in a tipi, and baptised in the Washita River. He was educated at the Rainy Mountain Kiowa Boarding School, where it was mandatory to speak the English Language; those who used the Kiowa language were threatened with physical punishment. Afterwards, he attended the Phoenix Indian School, Union High School, Lamson College, and Oklahoma State University. McKenzie attended the Phoenix Indian School with Nettie Odlety (c. 1896 – 1978), whom he married on August 23, 1919. At school the couple wrote each other letters in Kiowa. They also were some of the earliest Kiowa photographers, taking photographs in Arizona in 1916. Linguistic work When in 1918 the Smithsonian Institution sent the anthropologist John Peabody Harrington to Oklahoma to study the language of the Kiowa, McKenzie was his translator. This began a decades-long scientific examination and recording of the Kiowa language, which until then had been purely an oral language. They jointly developed a valid phonetic alphabet, which also resulted in the publication of Vocabulary of the Kiowa Language (1928) and Popular Account of the Kiowa Indian Language (1948), in a collaboration that extended into the 1950s. All this time, from the 1920s to the 1950s, McKenzie, never an academic, was a stenographer in the Indians Monies Section of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Late in his life, in close cooperation with Laurel Watkins, McKenzie published A Grammar of Kiowa in 1984. Some compared his work with the development of the Sequoyah and Cherokee alphabets. He also translated many texts from English, including Baptist hymns. Legacy His contributions to the Kiowa were honored by the University of Colorado in 1991 with the awarding of an honorary doctorate, and his 100th birthday was honored with a ceremony in the Red Buffalo Hall of the Kiowa Tribal Complex in Carnegie, Oklahoma.

As a Hispanic theologian, she was an innovator of Hispanic theology in general and specifically of mujerista theology. She was founder and co-director of the Hispanic Institute of Theology at Drew University until her retirement in 2009.  Early life and education  Born on March 22, 1943, Isasi-Díaz was born and raised in Havana, Cuba, to a Roman Catholic family. Her parents were Josefina Díaz Isasi and Domingo G. Isasi-Battle. She graduated from Merici Academy in 1960 and arrived in the United States as a political refugee later that year. She entered the Order of St. Ursula and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the College of New Rochelle in New York. In 1967, she went to Lima, Peru, as a missionary for three years. Upon returning to the United States in 1969, she left the order and taught high school for several years in Louisiana, then lived in Spain for 16 months before returning again to the United States. She settled in Rochester, New York. Isasi-Díaz earned a master of arts in medieval history from SUNY Brockport. In 1983, she continued her graduate studies at Union Theological Seminary in New York City where she earned both a Master of Divinity degree and a Doctor of Philosophy degree with a concentration in Christian ethics in 1990. In 2006, she was awarded a Doctor of Divinity honoris causa from Colgate University.  Career  Her studies and involvement in the feminist theological movement led her to begin to develop a theology from the perspective of Latinas in the United States, which led to the development of mujerista theology. This theology included their religious experiences, practices, and responses to the daily struggles of life. Early in her career Ada was very involved in the women's ordination movement within the Catholic Church. Because of this, Latina women living in the US who are keenly aware of how sexism, ethnic prejudice, and economic oppression subjugate them, use the term mujerista to refer to themselves and use mujerista theology to refer to the explanations of their faith and its role in their struggle for liberation. She was on the faculty of the theological and graduate schools of Drew University from 1991 to 2009. She was a panelist and occasional contributor to the \\"On Faith\\" online discussions at The Washington Post and Newsweek.  Mujerista theology  The term Mujerista was coined by Isasi- Díaz. Mujerista is both a self-identification as well as being a conceptual framework, used in thinking and understanding people, ideas and movements. Latina women living in the US who are aware of how sexism, ethnic prejudice, and economic oppression limit their wholeness of life, use the term mujerista to refer to themselves as well as to mujerista theology, a type of liberation theology that categorizes their faith and its role in their struggle for liberation from distinct experiences of subjugation.  Controversy  In 2007 she became an unofficial church pastor after the Archdiocese of New York closed Our Lady of Angels Catholic Church in East Harlem, the parish church she attended while in seminary. A group of parishioners began holding protests and prayer meetings outside the building, but eventually it became a neighborhood institution where Isasi-Díaz delivered sermons. In March 2012, Isasi-Díaz's invitation as a keynote speaker at the Vanderhaar Symposium at Christian Brothers University was canceled due to her support for the ordination of women to the Catholic priesthood and because she ministered at her nephew's same-sex marriage ceremony at a Unitarian Church in Washington in 2009.  Death  She died, after receiving her last rites, in New York on May 13, 2012, from cancer at age 69.Notice of death in New York Times obit section Her requiem mass was held at St. Thomas the Apostle Catholic Church in Miami, Florida, on 19 May 2012.

The D6 was one of the first American 4-4-0s to place the firebox above, rather than between, the locomotive's frames. This added about 8 inches to the possible width of the firebox, enabling a larger, easier to fire and more powerful locomotive; the maximum fire grate area increased to about from the previous maximum of about . The innovation was not wholly new, having been first seen on the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad's 1859 Vera Cruz, designed by James Milholland of that road and built in their own shops; the Reading used this design until the invention of the Wootten firebox in 1877. It was subsequently adopted by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1881 for six locomotives constructed for the Central of New Jersey; these were followed by the Pennsylvania Railroad locomotives, which garnered more attention for this design feature, in addition to having larger drivers than most previous 4-4-0s.

They were originally thought to be part of the birds-of-paradise family Paradisaeidae until genetic research suggested that the birds are not closely related to birds-of-paradise at all and are perhaps closer to berry peckers and longbills (Melanocharitidae). The current evidence suggests that their closest relatives may be the cuckoo-shrikes (Campephagidae).http://creagrus.home.montereybay.com/satinbirds.html  Etymology  The family name \\"Cnemophilidae\\" consists of the words knemos for \\"mountain/slope\\" and philos for \\"lover\\", referring to the species' fondness for mountain slopes.  Description  The satinbirds are all very beautifully colored in their own right. The males of the red satinbird are a rich reddish orange to a flame red on their upperparts, sporting dark blackish to black underparts and also have light, purplish erectile sagittal crest that lies on the crown and extends from the forehead to nearly the back of the head. Females of this species are an olive brown with paler underparts. Male yellow satinbirds have brilliant, silky, flame-yellow plumage above, with a black throat, black chin, black belly and black rump, and glistening golden crest plumes, while females are brownish to olive above with pale light yellow underparts. The other two species, Loria's and yellow-breasted satinbirds are much more different from the aforementioned species. Loria's satinbid male is mostly black with shiny purple or metallic sheens; they have iridescent light blue secondary wing feathers, iridescent blue tail feathers, and an iridescent greenish-aqua patch of feathers leading from the base of the bill to right above the eyes. Females, like the others mentioned above, are olive greenish with lighter underparts. Male yellow-breasted satinbirds have reddish-olive upperparts, except for the upper rump, which is a yellow gold. The underparts are golden yellow from the chin and cheeks to the breast, then fades to a paler yellow wash past the breast. Unique for the satinbirds, the males also have bulbous wattles, or lobes, on the top of the bill that are a pale sky blue in color. The female is brownish rufous above and cream below with brownish streaks from the chin to the breast. Male yellow satinbird - note its silky bright golden upperparts. Satinbirds have weak, non-manipulative feet, wide gapes (at one time they were given the name \\"wide-gaped bird-of- paradise\\"), as well as an unossified nasal region. Their bodies are compact with rounded wings. Distribution and habitat Loria's satinbird may have the broadest range in the central highlands, mostly from 2000–4000 m, but is inconspicuous except at fruiting trees. The red satinbird inhabits high mountain forest and shrubbery. The yellow-breasted satinbird is the least known. Almost nothing is known of its biology, and it seems scarce and local within the patches of habitat along the central ranges east to the base of the Huon Peninsula. Yellow satinbirds are found only in the \\"Bird's Tail\\" region in South East New Guinea. Behavior and ecology All species of satinbirds build domed nests, unlike those of birds of paradise. The female lays a single egg and takes care of it without any assistance from the male. Satinbirds feed exclusively on fruit, even at a young age.

Before Parliament Born in London of Irish parents in 1937, Michael Beahan was educated at the Salesian College in Battersea, where he successfully completed O levels in 1953. Following a year as a clerk with a large insurance company, he migrated to Australia with his parents, four brothers and his sister in 1954. He commenced work as a process worker at the Australian Electrical Company, which manufactured electric motors, transformers and welders at its East Perth factory, later gaining an apprenticeship with an allied company. Having completed his apprenticeship he gained an A grade licence, permitting him to carry out all types of electrical work and later established his own small business as an electrical contractor. During this time he undertook compulsory military service (three months full- time and two years compulsory part-time) serving with the 13th Field Squadron of the Royal Australian Engineers.

It extends east and west across Northern Africa, south of the Mediterranean dry woodlands and steppe ecoregion of the Maghreb and Cyrenaica, which is part of the Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub biome. Winter rains sustain shrublands and dry woodlands that form an ecotone between the Mediterranean climate regions to the north and the hyper-arid Sahara Desert ecoregion to the south. Geography The North Saharan steppe and woodlands covers in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia, and Western Sahara. The climate in this ecoregion is hot and dry in the summer but cooler with some rain in the winter. Atlantic depressions sometimes penetrate inland between October and April. Rainfall is erratic, but averages in the north and in the south. During the summer, temperatures regularly rise to and evaporation far exceeds precipitation. Ecology There are varying habitats in the ecoregion including sandy systems, rocky plateaus, wadis, depressions and mountains. Each has its own characteristic species and there is considerable endemism of both plants and animals in the area. Small mammals endemic to the Sahara area include the four-toed jerboa (Allactaga tetradactyla), North African gerbil (Gerbillus campestris), James's gerbil (G. jamesi), pale gerbil (G. perpallidus), lesser short-tailed gerbil (G. simoni), sand gerbil (G. syrticus), fat-tailed gerbil (Pachyuromys duprasi) and Shaw's jird (Meriones shawi). Larger mammals include the dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas), mountain gazelle (Gazella cuvieri) and slender-horned gazelle (Gazella leptoceros). There are a variety of snakes and lizards, including two endemic species, desert agama (Trapelus mutabilis) and Natterer's gecko (Tropiocolotes nattereri). There are few amphibians, Brongersma's toad (Bufo brongersmai) being endemic to the coastal region of North Africa. Among the bird species, the Houbara bustard (Chlamydotis undulata) and Nubian bustard (Neotis nuba) have decreased in numbers because of hunting pressure.

Nicknamed 'Maddo', he is from the town of Kiama, New South Wales.  Background  Born in Caringbah, Maddison grew up in Kiama Downs, and developed his passion for riding by competing in national motocross and supercross events. He completed Year 10 at Kiama High School and took up an electrical apprenticeship. Maddison continued learning freestyle motocross (FMX) tricks and after becoming proficient in the skills he entered his first amateur event, and won both the amateur and professional events at Bacchus Marsh, Victoria.  Early career  In early 2004 Maddison won Gold at the X Games held at Australia's Wonderland after completing 13 back flips. In May 2005, the Crusty Demons motorcycle stunt group gave Maddison the opportunity to break two world records on his motorbike: * 125 cc (cubic centimetres of engine displacement) Distance Guinness world record: 221feet * 250 cc Distance world record with a trick - 'superman seat grab'.  Career  After this Maddison went on to win numerous international FMX events around the world and has been recognized as one of the best FMX riders of all time. Maddo's motto: \\"Face your fears - live your dreams\\" On 31 December 2007, (on the 40th anniversary of Evel Knievel jumping the fountains at Caesars Palace), and live on the ESPN cable TV network, Maddison broke the World motorcycle jumping record, travelling 98.34m on a motorbike. He repeated the event immediately afterward, successfully landing the jump, as his fiancée Amy looked on. His second attempt, however, did not go as far as the first jump; he was not injured in either jump. On 29 March 2008, Maddison broke his own world record twice during the Crusty Demons Night of World Records show in Melbourne, Australia. During his first jump he travelled and landed on the safety zone nearly hitting the front of the landing ramp. On his second attempt Maddison broke the world record by travelling . This time he landed hard on his back tyre and was not satisfied by the jump, so he decided to jump once more. On his third jump he again broke the world record, this time with 106.98m (350.98 feet) into a perfect landing. On 1 January 2009, live on ESPN, Maddison and his Yamaha YZ 250 motorbike successfully jumped up onto the Arc de Triomphe in front of Paris Las Vegas and then descended an drop off the monument safely to ground level. Maddison said after the jump that he may have broken his hand and had a gash to the bone in the webbing of his left hand. On 30 May 2009, Maddison indicated he was more than just a stuntman by defeating the world's best freestyle riders at the Calgary, AB, Canada stop of the Red Bull X-Fighters competition. His victory in the Head-to-Head competition meant he had to progress through three rounds, defeating multiple X Games medallist Nate Adams (USA) in the first, defending series champion Mat Rebeaud (SUI) in the semi-final round and then 30-year-old series veteran Eigo Sato (JPN) in the final. On 13 July 2009, Maddison jumped Tower Bridge in London, with a backflip, whilst the drawbridge was open by 25 feet. The following weekend Maddison went on to the Red Bull X-Fighters championship in Madrid, winning the best trick contest with a brand new trick, an 'under flip one hander to side saddle lander'. In March 2010, Maddison become the first person to jump the start gantry at the Formula One in Melbourne, Australia. On 7 April 2010, Maddison performed a motocross jump over the Corinth Canal in Greece. That made him the first FMX rider who accomplished to cross over the canal on his motorbike. He took off with a speed of 120 km/h and jumped over more than 80m. About the jump, Maddison said: \\"Jumping across the Corinth Canal became a challenge I just could not resist. This jump involved the highest consequences I have faced so far. I believe that sometimes you have to take risks in life to become wiser and facing a challenge like this will help get me ready for the next aim I will face in the future. I am thrilled about managing to pull it off, as you know there is only one opportunity to get it right!\\" On 31 December 2011 Maddison attempted to jump 400 feet across San Diego Bay as part of Red Bull New Year No Limits, in a tandem jump with American snowmobile racer Levi LaVallee. After landing over 391 ft in practice, he landed shy of the 400 feet goal on the night due to the fog, damp conditions and reduced traction, landing 378 ft, 9 inches. Maddison went to Istanbul early in 2012 to be the motorbike stunt double for James Bond actor Daniel Craig in the Bond movie Skyfall. He went on to receive a Screen Actors Guild Award for best stunt ensemble for Skyfall. In 2013 he went on to win the Taurus World Stunt Awards for \\"best stunt with a vehicle.\\" In April 2015 Maddison successfully rode a modified dirt motorbike on a wave near Teahupoo in Tahiti, after two years of preparation for the event. In 2016, Maddison developed a special edition snow bike in cooperation with YETI SnowMX, the 2017 'Special Edition Robbie Maddison YETI SnowMX snowbike'. In 2017, Maddison appeared in the movie XXX: Return of Xander Cage, performing as a stunt double for actor Vin Diesel as he rode a motorbike on the ocean.http://www.edenmagnet.com.au/story/4434503/maddo-doubles-for-vin-diesel- video/?cs=12 On 4 February 2017, Maddison claimed on his Facebook page that, \\"I set a new world record yesterday on distance ridden on the water\\", showing photoshttps://scontent- sea1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/16487451_10154574163654006_1252234275291898144_o.jpg?oh=10a68ce4f4aeccedbb04c9eb638ec988&oe;=59329C14 of his distance of 19.8 miles in a time of 31.29 at a top speed of 45 mph happening on 3 February 2017.

Melbourne Bone Bed is a paleontological site located at Crane Creek in Melbourne, in the U.S. state of Florida. This site contains fossils from the Late Pleistocene period 20,000 to 10,000 years before present.Brevard County Historical Commission. Historic Brevard: Your Guide to Historic Landmarks in Brevard County (2006), p. 24. The fossils include extinct animals such as varieties of camels, giant armadillos, giant beavers, giant bison, giant ground sloths, mammoths, mastodons, saber- toothed cats and tapirs. The excavations were conducted at three sites; the Golf Course site on the east bank of Crane Creek on the Melbourne Golf and Country Club (south of West New Haven Avenue), the Singleton Estate site about southeast of the Golf Course site, and a minor site on the south bank of Crane Creek about west of the Golf Course site. C. P. Singleton discovered the bones of a mammoth (Mammuthus columbi) on his property along Crane Creek, from Melbourne, and brought in Amherst College paleontologist Frederick B. Loomis to excavate the skeleton. Loomis found a second elephant, with a \\"large rough flint instrument\\" Purdy:23 among fragments of the elephant's ribs. Loomis found in the same stratum mammoth, mastodon, horse, ground sloth, tapir, peccary, camel, and saber-tooth cat bones, all extinct in Florida since the end of the Pleistocene 10,000 years ago. At a nearby site a human rib and charcoal were found in association with Mylodon, Megalonyx, and Chlamytherium (ground sloth) teeth. A finely worked spear point found with these items may have been displaced from a later stratum. In 1925 attention shifted to the Melbourne golf course. A crushed human skull with finger, arm, and leg bones was found in association with a horse tooth. A piece of ivory that appeared to have been modified by humans was found at the bottom of the stratum containing bones. Other finds included a spear point near a mastodon bone and a turtle- back scraper and blade found with bear, camel, mastodon, horse, and tapir bones.Purdy:23-9 James Gidley of the Smithsonian Institution joined Loomis in 1926, and continued to collect from the site until 1929. C. P. Singleton also continued to collect from the Golf Course site when Loomis and Gidley were absent, reportedly with the permission of the Smithsonian and some funding from Harvard University. The Melbourne site has been described as \\"one of the \\"Big Three\\" late Pleistocene sites discovered in Florida during the first half of the 20th Century\\". Melbourne Man The skull found at the Melbourne Golf Course was exhibited at the Paleontological Society of America meeting in 1925. This discovery sparked a 30-year debate between geologists and archaeologists resulting in the skull becoming known as the Melbourne Man. Recent consensus dates the Melbourne Man as early as 10,000 BC confirming that Native Americans coexisted with Pleistocene mammals in the area at the end of that period. Human remains, Pleistocene animals and Paleo-Indian artifacts similar to those from the Melbourne Bone Bed were found in Vero Beach, south of Melbourne, and similar Paleo-Indian artifacts were found at the Helen Blazes archaeological site, southwest of Melbourne.

Often called Manini, Marini or other variations, he became a confidant of Hawaiian King Kamehameha I. Marín acted as a jack-of-all-trades, sometimes even acting as a physician, probably without any formal education, and is credited with introducing many agricultural products. Life Marín's early life is not generally known, but he probably was born November 25, 1774, in Jerez de la Frontera, an area of Spain near Cadiz. His father was Juan Marín and mother was María Grassi. It was likely he was an apprentice pilot on a ship associated with the Alessandro Malaspina expedition to Nootka Sound and Vancouver Island. At some point he deserted the Spanish and came aboard the American brig Lady Washington, captain John Kendrick. He arrived in the Hawaiian Islands in 1793 or 1794. He became an interpreter and advisor in the acquisition and use of Western military weapons to King Kamehameha I who was just capturing Oahu island in the Battle of Nu'uanu. For his service Marín was given land in present-day Honolulu near Pearl Harbor. He took at least one more trip off the islands. In 1804 he went as a pilot with captain James Rowan of the Hazard where he interpreted for Rowan with the Native Americans of the Pacific Northwest. Diplomacy and horticulture Despite deserting them, Marín kept on good terms with the Spanish in Alta California. A natural charmer, he also had good relations with pirates such as Hippolyte de Bouchard on his visit in 1818, and the French navigator Louis de Freycinet in 1819. He often asked for and received seeds, plants and animals, and then experimented with planting new kinds of fruits and vegetables in the Hawaiian Islands. He established Hawaii's first grape vineyard in 1815, and produced its first wine and brandy. He distilled sugarcane into rum, and experimented with beer. In 1813, Marin cultivated the Hawaiian Islands' first pineapple crop, See also: Collins, J.L. (1934). Introduction of pineapples in Hawaii and some brief accounts of pioneer pineapple growing. Pineapple Quarterly. 4 pp. 119-130. and is usually credited with the first cotton, mango, and orangeRuth Tabrah. Hawaii: A Bicentennial History. New York City: W. W. Norton & Co. 1980, p. 26. cultivation. He raised some of the first horses and cattle. Although some of these products might have been grown in household gardens, he ran the first Western-style commercial farming operation. His home became a boarding house, as he rented rooms and served meals to visiting merchants. Marín at Hale Kauila with the royal court receiving the French Captain Du Petit Thouars, 1837. As the speaker of several languages, he was the unofficial diplomatic corps of Honolulu, acting as accountant and tax collector as he sold his products to restock ships. In April 1819 he was sent to attend the ailing Kamehameha as de facto royal physician and stayed with the king until he died on May 8. The new King, Kamehameha II, and his young French drinking companion Jean Baptiste Rives were happy to offer Marín's refreshments to visitors. On December 10, 1819, Kamehameha II officially commissioned Marín as a captain in the Hawaiian Army. Family His son Paul Marin (right) photographed with Henry A. Neilson in the uniform of the Hawaiian Cavalry, 1855 Marín was also known for his family of at least three native Hawaiian wives and many children. His exact number of offspring is clouded by his penchant for exaggeration. One daughter married Portuguese stonemason Antonio Ferreira, who in 1810 built one of the first stone houses in Honolulu for the Marín family. Daughter Cruz Marín married English sea captain Joseph Maughan. Daughter Lahilahi had children with American Consul John Coffin Jones (even though Jones was already married). Sons Nicolas and Paul F. Marin developed some early commercial facilities of the waterfront. His daughter Antoinette F. Manini (1832–1905) married businessman Lyman Swan in 1851. Although Swan was accused of fraud in Hawaii, the family moved to Santa Cruz, California and became stable members of the early community there. Marín wrote to governor Luis Antonio Argüello about moving to Alta California himself, but was told his multiple wives would not be welcome. Religion Despite his polygamy, Marín favored the Roman Catholic Church. When the first priests arrived, his growing family made a substantial part of the congregation. He acted as interpreter when the first Christian missionaries arrived in 1820. When Richard Charlton, the first official British trade representative, arrived he brought a letter addressed to Marín saying that land should be provided for the consulate. When Charlton pressed his claim, he produced a lease witnessed by Marín. When arrived in 1825 with the bodies of Kamehameha II and his queen, who died in London, more plants were left off with Marín, including some of the first coffee trees. Although the English gardener John Wilkinson sent on the Blonde soon died, many of the plants thrived on Marín's farm. Over the next few years, the puritanical views of Protestant missionaries such as Hiram Bingham I began to lessen Marín's influence. Alcoholic beverages were put under strict regulation, and Catholic priests were banished. Legacy Marín died in Honolulu on October 30, 1837. After Robert Crichton Wyllie found Marín's diary as he started the Hawaii archives, he said: > ...much of the present wealth of the islands, is owing to the seeds, roots, > and plants introduced by that one man. In my own opinion, it may be fairly > questioned if there existed on these islands, or exists at present, any man, > to whom the Hawaiian people are generally so much indebted. Marin street near the Honolulu Harbor was named for him . Marin Street A 28-story high-rise apartment house called Marin Tower was built in 1994 on the site of his house, marked by a plaque and a sculpture titled Site of Passage by Laura Ruby. Vineyard street and boulevard at is also named for his vineyard.

The Old Book of Tang further indicated that this commission was shortly after his brief demotion to be the prefect of Mei Prefecture, which in turn was described to be \\"early in the Shenlong era\\" (705-707) and be on account of his having flattered Wu Zetian's lovers Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong, who were killed in 705 in a coup that overthrew Wu Zetian. This implies that these events occurred in 705, but does not conclusively establish this. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 94 and New Book of Tang, vol. 114.), was an official of the Chinese Tang dynasty and Wu Zetian's Zhou dynasty, twice serving as chancellor during Wu Zetian's reign.  Background  Su Weidao might have been born in 648, at the end of the reign of Emperor Taizong. His family was from Zhao Prefecture (趙州, roughly modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei). In his youth, he was well known in the locale for his literary talent, along with Li Jiao, also from Zhao Prefecture. After he passed the imperial examination, he was made the sheriff of Xianyang County (咸陽, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). Pei Xingjian (), then the deputy minister of civil service affairs, was impressed by his talent, and in 679, when Pei was set to command an army against Western Tujue's Shixing Khan Ashina Duzhi (), who had just rebelled against Tang Dynasty, Pei invited Su to serve as his secretary. Around that time, the official Pei Judao had just been made a general commanding the imperial guards, and, after searching for a talented person to write a thanksgiving submission to then-reigning Emperor Gaozong (Emperor Taizong's son), found Su. The submission that Su wrote on Pei Judao's behalf was said to be well-written in an intricate manner, and he became famous.  During Wu Zetian's reign  In 694, during the reign of Emperor Gaozong's wife Wu Zetian, Su Weidao was serving as Fengge Sheren (), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (鳳閣, Fengge), when he was promoted to be the deputy head of the legislative bureau (鳳閣侍郎, Fengge Shilang) and given the designation Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor de facto. Soon thereafter, when Wu Zetian's lover Huaiyi was commissioned to command an army against Eastern Tujue, Su and fellow chancellor Li Zhaode were commissioned to assist Huaiyi. In late 694, Wu Zetian, displeased with the power Li had, exiled Li, and fellow chancellor Zhou Yunyuan and the assistant chief judge of the supreme court, Huangfu Wenbei (), then submitted articles of impeachment against Su and several fellow chancellors -- Doulu Qinwang, Wei Juyuan, Du Jingjian, and Lu Yuanfang—for not being able to curb Li Zhaode's power. The five chancellors so accused were all demoted to be prefectural prefect—in Su's case, to be the prefect of Ji Prefecture (集州, roughly modern Bazhong, Sichuan). However, Su was soon recalled to be deputy minister of civil service affairs (天官侍郎, Tianguan Shilang). In 698, he was again made Fengge Shilang and chancellor with the designation Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi. It was said that despite Su's abilities, he just tried to get by as a chancellor and rarely made key decisions. He had once stated, \\"It is not good to stand on principles or insist on things. It is better to be ambiguous.\\" This caused him to be nicknamed \\"Ambiguous Su.\\" However, he was praised for his loving relations with his brother Su Weixuan (), also an official. At times, Su Weixuan would make requests of him that he would deny, and Su Weixuan, displeased, would insult him, but he would take no offense from the insults. In 701, both Su and fellow chancellor Zhang Xi were imprisoned—Zhang on accusations of corruption, while Su's alleged crimes were not specified in historical records. When Zhang reported to prison, he rode a horse to prison and acted normally. After he was placed within the special unit for high-level officials who were imprisoned, he continued to sleep on a regular bed and eat regular food. Su, on the other hand, walked to prison, slept on a thin mattress, and ate very simple foods. When Wu Zetian received reports, she pardoned Su and allowed him to resume his posts, while initially sentencing Zhang to death but then commuting the death penalty to exile. In 704, Su requested a leave to go back to Zhao Prefecture to bury his father. Wu Zetian ordered the local government to supply his funeral needs, but Su used this opportunity to take over neighbors' lands and destroy their tombs. He further forced people into labor beyond what was permitted by Wu Zetian. The censor Xiao Zhizhong submitted an article of impeachment, and she demoted Su to be the prefect of Fang Prefecture (坊州, in modern Yan'an, Shaanxi). He was then made the secretary general at Yi Prefecture (益州, roughly modern Chengdu, Sichuan).  During Emperor Zhongzong's second reign  Wu Zetian was overthrown in a coup 705, and her son Li Xian the Crown Prince, formerly emperor, was restored to the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong). During the coup, Wu Zetian's lovers Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong were killed. Su was accused of flattering the Zhangs and demoted to be the prefect of Mei Prefecture (郿州, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), but he was soon restored to his position as secretary general of Yi Prefecture. Before he could depart for Yi Prefecture, however, he died and was buried with honors.

His creation of often irreverent commercial entertainment follows in the footsteps of his father, Irwin Weisfeld, a writer and manufacturer of ubiquitous mid-late 60s counter culture buttons.  Early Years In Business/Publishing  In the early 1990s Weisfeld co-founded and financed Bullet Comics, which published one of the first Manga influenced American comics: Greg Boone's RADREX. Weisfeld was also instrumental in helping his friend, artist Mark Beachum, set up Aju-Blu Comics. Weisfeld then advised Brian Pulido in the formation of Chaos! Comics (Lady Death), one of the more successful independent comic publishers of the era. In 1992 a former publisher of The New York Post hired Weisfeld to work on the startup of Her New York, a daily newspaper published from offices of New York's Trump Tower. Weisfeld became Newsroom Manager (and later assistant) to Editor-in-Chief Marsha Cohen (formerly of The New York Daily News) and Entertainment Editor Barbara Gordon (who wrote bestseller I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can). Penthouse Comix In 1993, Weisfeld was named managing editor of Penthouse Comix, an ongoing section that ran in Penthouse Magazine. At Weisfeld's suggestion publisher Bob Guccione agreed to a plan that would allow Penthouse Comix to cherry pick art talent from competitors. This resulted in Penthouse Comix offering a per-page art rate to freelancers of $800, the largest ever established as a standard for comic book line art. Penthouse Comix sections featured artwork by top comic book talent (Kevin Nowlan, Arthur Suydam, Adam Hughes, etc.). After the initial sections appeared, publisher Bob Guccione requested Penthouse Comix become its own stand alone magazine. The first issue of the 96-page stand alone Penthouse Comix appeared in the spring of 1994 and was an immediate success. It featured a number of characters originated by Weisfeld including Libby in the Lost World (co-created with artist Arthur Suydam), which became an international hit in foreign editions and prompted many additional installments of the series. Issues of American Penthouse Comix were published thereafter on a bi-monthly basis. American Penthouse Comix published through 1998, producing thirty-five issues while inspiring Penthouse to publish two stand alone spinoff magazines (Penthouse Men's Adventure Comix and Penthouse Max). Penthouse Comix Magazine was licensed into many non-English markets. The Spanish edition of Penthouse Comix celebrated its 100th issue in 2010. Bad Magazine In 1997 rap mogul Russell Simmons struck a deal to develop an “urban” spin-off of Mad Magazine with Time/Warner Publishing. Weisfeld was recruited to develop editorial for Russell Simmons Presents B.A.D Magazine and eventually became Managing Editor. Film designer Floyd Hughes was named Art Director. Writers and artists on the project included Deborah Gregory (who later created Disney's Cheetah Girls), Arthur Suydam (who went to later fame with Marvel Zombies), Walter Moore, and others. The project was developed with the consistent involvement of DC Comics President and Mad Magazine Publisher Jenette Kahn. Warner publishing eventually decided that BAD was too edgy for America’s newsstands and The project was re-conceived as an animation project for HBO and then disappeared into development hell. During the period in which Bad was developed, members of the team also worked on the initial development of Warner's Green Lantern (film). Bad partner and co-editor, Danny Simmons, was eventually appointed by The New York Art's Council as chief budget liaison to The New York State Governor's Office. Forbidden Zone Magazine In 1999 Weisfeld was named Managing Editor of another glossy comics magazine, Forbidden Zone. The publication was designed to present new trademark characters and compete with Heavy Metal Magazine on the newsstand. Forbidden Zone published only one issue but this was packed with top comic book and fantasy art talent: Simon Bisley, Richard Corben, Arthur Suydam, Joe Linsner, Larry Stroman, John Cebollero and others. Before publication of the first issue, Forbidden Zone Magazine parent Galaxy Entertainment sank into (tech-bubble) fatal financial trouble. In 2004, Industry Of War, a comic book property co-created by Jordan Raskin and Horatio Weisfeld (back in 1993), was optioned for film by Alien, Total Recall, Minority Report producer Ronald Shusett. Image Comics later published a comic book series based on the property.  Weisfeld / Simmons Entertainment  In 2005, Weisfeld and Danny Simmons (Producer of HBO's Def Poetry Jam and Brother of mogul Russell Simmons) formed Weisfeld/Simmons Entertainment. The company acquired media properties for live action and animation. Heavy Metal Magazine and later work  Starting in 2000 Weisfeld began a long term relationship with Heavy metal Magazine, for whom he developed, wrote, and packaged several character driven properties and HM spin-off brands. This began with the first installment of Joe In The Future, an ongoing series of short comic book stories written by Weisfeld (with Peter Koch) and illustrated by Trevor Von Eeden. The title character, Joe, wanders through a hostile futuristic environment while doggedly searching for cigarettes. The series received good reviews and (despite an infrequent schedule) developed a cult following. Heavy Metal began running Joe In The Future as a print series in 2001 after the initial episode appeared as 3-minute internet flash web animation. Heavy Metal editor Howard Jorofsky suggested Weisfeld allow the print magazine to run the comic book pages from which the webisode had been created. Weisfeld then followed with several additional Joe in the Future print installments for Heavy Metal. https://web.archive.org/web/20141012193604/http://shop.heavymetal.com/shm/images/channels/magazine/0107/05.html The nearly simultaneous appearance of Joe in the Future as both web-animation and print episodes makes the series an early example of web-initiated Transmedia storytelling. The most recent episode of the Joe in the Future print series appeared in the September 2010 Heavy Metal Magazine issue. In 2007, Weisfeld began developing an illustrated text format for Heavy Metal magazine. Painted artwork for the initial segment (Slaughter of the Exterminators) was completed by film production designer Rafael Kayanan (Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, John Carter of Mars). The finished story appeared in the January 2009 issue of HM. thumbrightspread from illustrated text story Slaughter of the Exterminators by Horatio Weisfeld & Rafael Kayanan > Printed in Heavy Metal Magazine in 2008 During this period Kayanan was also involved in the design of Julie Taymor's Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark. The Heavy Metal Magazine illustrated text format become the model for a spin-off project, Heavy Metal Pulp, a line of illustrated science fiction novels published by Tor books beginning in 2010. Weisfeld's later \\"illustrated text\\" stories in Heavy Metal Magazine included the concluding chapter for the long running Joe In The Future series (this installment with painted art by The Pratt Institute's head of illustration, Floyd Hughes) https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083148/http://shop.heavymetal.com/shm/images/channels/magazine/0910/08.html and a black comedy, The Holo-Marketeer, about the grim and frightening world of a futuristic salesman (with artwork by Trevor Von Eeden). The stories show different views of a near future descending into violence and apocalyptic disorder. In 2011 Weisfeld developed another addition to the Heavy Metal Magazine brand with the creation of Metal Media, a news and personality section featuring unseen film pre-production art, profiles, movie design reviews, and other material related to science fiction and fantasy entertainment. The initial section spotlighted the work of film pre-production artist Rafael Kayanan and discussed Kayanan's character designs for director Tarsem Singh's Immortals (2011 film). In a January 2012 Metal Media article, Weisfeld described his father's creation of a 1960s fad button (Melville Eats Blubber), which was cited in letters written by San Francisco's Zodiac Killer. The Zodiac changed the button's phrase to \\"Melvin Eats Blubber,\\" a swipe at lawyer Melvin Belli as inspiration for his button extortion plot against the city. The Zodiac threatened to blow up a school bus if he did not see people wearing \\"Zodiac Buttons.\\" The school bus threat became a central element of the film Dirty Harry, a film which ironically had been a strong influence on Weisfeld's creative development when he was a teenager. The original \\"Melville Eats Blubber\\" button was produced by the Horatio Button Company, named for Weisfeld by his father, when Weisfeld was a child, several years before the Zodiac killings began.

It was discovered on 4 August 1983, by Soviet astronomer Lyudmila Karachkina at the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory in Nauchnij, on the Crimean peninsula. The dark D-type asteroid is the principal body of the proposed Makhaon family and belongs to the 20 largest Jupiter trojans having a rotation period of 8.6 hours. It was named after the legendary healer Machaon from Greek mythology.  Orbit and classification  Makhaon is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's Lagrangian point, 60° ahead of its orbit in a 1:1 resonance (see Trojans in astronomy). It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.9–5.5 AU once every 11 years and 11 months (4,345 days; semi-major axis of 5.21 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.06 and an inclination of 12° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken at Lowell Observatory in February 1931, more than 52 years prior to its official discovery observation at Nauchnij. = Makhaon family = Fernando Roig and Ricardo Gil-Hutton identified Makhaon as the principal body of a small Jovian asteroid family, using the hierarchical clustering method (HCM), which looks for groupings of neighboring asteroids based on the smallest distances between them in the proper orbital element space. According to the astronomers, the Makhaon family belongs to the larger Menelaus clan, an aggregation of Jupiter trojans which is composed of several families, similar to the Flora family in the inner asteroid belt. However this family is not included in David Nesvorný HCM-analysis from 2014. Instead, Makhaon is listed as a non-family asteroid of the Jovian background population on the Asteroids Dynamic Site (AstDyS) which based on another analysis by Milani and Knežević.  Naming  This minor planet was named from Greek mythology after the legendary healer Machaon, a physician to the Greek troops during the Trojan War as mentioned in Homer's Iliad. He is the son of Asclepius and Epione and brother of Hygieia, Podalirius (who was also a physician) and Panacea. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 26 March 1986 ().  Physical characteristics  In both the Tholen- and SMASS-like taxonomy of the Small Solar System Objects Spectroscopic Survey (S3OS2), Makhaon is a dark D-type asteroid, the most common spectral type among the Jupiter trojans. It is also an assumed C-type asteroid with a V–I color index of 0.83, lower than most larger D-types. It has a B–R magnitude of 1.23 –the difference in magnitude between the blue and red filter – indicating a spectra redder than that of the Sun, which has a B–R mag of 1.03. = Rotation period = Several rotational lightcurves of Makhaon have been obtained since its first photometric observation by Richard Binzel in 1988. It gave a rotation period of 17.3 hours (). In November 2009, French amateur astronomer René Roy measured a period of 2.6 hours from a fragmentary lightcurve based on a single-night observation.(). Italian astronomer Stefano Mottola reported a period of 8.6354 and 8.648 taken from observation at La Silla Observatory, Chile, in June 1994, and from Calar Alto Observatory, Spain, in December 2009 with a low brightness variation of 0.06 and 0.09, respectively (). In December 2010 and April 2014, follow-up observations by Daniel Coley in collaboration with Robert Stephens at the Center for Solar System Studies and the Goat Mountain Astronomical Research Station rendered a period of 8.64 and 8.45 hours and an amplitude of 0.15 magnitude (). The result shows that Binzel's first measurement was probably an alternative period solution (i.e. twice the actual period). In February 2013, Michael Alkema at the Elephant Head Observatory in Arizona reported a concurring period of 8.639 hours with a brightness variation of 0.08 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Makhaon measures between 111.65 and 116.14 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.0476 and 0.056. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0569 and a diameter of 116.35 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 8.4.

Wales. Betsey departed Macau on 10 November 1805, heading for Sydney in New South Wales. Her crew comprised two officers, Captain William Brooks and chief mate Edward Luttrell, and ten seaman including four from China, three from the Philippines and three from Portugal. At 2.30 AM on 21 November 1805 Betsey struck a reef. For three days the crew struggled to refloat their stricken vessel before abandoning her. Brooks, Luttrell, and three Portuguese crew climbed into the jollyboat and the remaining crew abandoned the ship on a raft. The jollyboat and raft planned to travel together but a strong wind parted them. The raft and its crew were never seen again. The jollyboat reached Balambangan Island off the North Coast of Borneo and the crew landed on 2 December. There 11 natives attacked them. Brooks died after having had both legs cut off. One of the Portuguese crew was severely wounded as he made his way back to the boat; he died in the boat. Lutterell fought off the attackers and with the remaining two Portuguese headed back out to sea. On 15 December the three men approached some new islands where they hoped to replenish their food supplies. As they were planning to land three Malay prows attacked them. The Malays succeeded in spearing and killing one Portuguese, and wounding the other. Their attackers captured both Lutterell and the surviving crew member and kept them as slaves. They were entirely naked and lived off sago. On 20 April 1806 their captors put Lutterell and the Portuguese sailor aboard a prow, took them to Singapore, and released them. Both made it back to Malacca.

The dark Jovian asteroid has a rotation period of 8.1 hours and likely an elongated shape. It was named after the hero Sinon from Greek mythology.  Orbit and classification  Sinon is a dark Jovian asteroid in a 1:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter. It is located in the leading Greek camp at the Gas Giant's Lagrangian point, 60° ahead on its orbit . It is also a non-family asteroid of the Jovian background population. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.9–5.7 AU once every 12 years and 3 months (4,461 days; semi-major axis of 5.3 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.08 and an inclination of 15° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery at Palomar Observatory in March 1953, almost 24 years prior to its official discovery observation at Kiso.  Physical characteristics  Sinon is an assumed, carbonaceous C-type asteroid. = Rotation period = In February 2013, a rotational lightcurve of Sinon was obtained from photometric observations by Lawrence Wasserman at Lowell Observatory and by Robert Stephens at the Center for Solar System Studies. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.72 magnitude, indicative of a non-spherical shape (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Sinon measures 37.86 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.093, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for a carbonaceous asteroid of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 48.48 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 10.3.  Naming  This minor planet was named from Greek mythology after Sinon, a Greek warrior of the Trojan War. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 16 December 1986 ().

Through public awareness campaigns, campaign schools, research, election tracking, and lobbying political parties, Equal Voice seeks to increase the numbers of women elected to public office federally, provincially and municipally. Electing women in Canada: challenges and strategies In order to ensure that more women are elected in Canada, it is critical that Canada’s political parties adopt action plans to break down barriers for women in politics. Equal Voice encourages the Liberal Party of Canada, the Conservative Party of Canada, the New Democratic Party, the Bloc Québécois and the Green Party of Canada, to be proactive in their recruitment and support of women candidates. Equal Voice promotes the election of more women by: * Working with all political parties to increase the nominations of women candidates; * Promoting electoral and other changes that would increase the numbers of women in politics; * Conducting outreach with young women to inspire and engage them in politics as a future career choice; * Encouraging women to run for office; * Research and election tracking; * Raising awareness about the impact of women's under- representation; * Celebrating women in politics; and * Hosting events across Canada, including campaign schools and other events aimed to equip and support women in politics. Regional and youth chapters Equal Voice Chapters and University Campus Clubs aim to increase public awareness about the underrepresentation of women in politics by hosting events and providing networking and mentoring opportunities across Canada. In order to found a chapter, leaders must prove they support a multi-partisan approach to promoting the cause of electing more women in politics. Chapters must be devoted solely to the cause of electing more women. There are currently chapters in the National Capital Region (NCR), Toronto, Alberta South, Alberta North, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Newfoundland and Labrador. In addition to regional chapters, there are student chapters at: The University of McGill, The University of Ottawa, Carleton University and York University, with chapters quickly emerging across the country.  Daughters of the Vote  On International Women's Day 2017, Equal Voice held its inaugural Daughters of the Vote (DOV) program in Ottawa, Ontario. The program was created to promote the participation of women in politics and government, and was funded by corporate sponsors and the federal Department for the Status of Women. 338 young women, aged 18 to 23, from each federal riding in Canada were selected to take part in a once-in-a-lifetime political leadership program hosted by Equal Voice. Delegates sat in the House of Commons for a historic sitting of the Chamber and were addressed by every federal party leader. On October 3rd, the Minister for the Status of Women, Maryam Monsef, announced an investment of $3.8 million to support Equal Voice's Daughters of the Vote program, over three years. The second iteration of the program took place on April 3rd, 2019, and a third event is expected to take place in the Spring of 2021.  Systemic Change  Equal Voice is currently working on a nationwide multi- partisan initiative to address some of the systemic barriers within legislatures and Parliament that contribute to the under-representation of women in politics at the provincial, territorial, and federal levels in Canada. Funded by the Department for Women and Gender Equality, this project produced recommendations for change that would improve legislatures and encourage the election and retention of more women in politics. Examples range from the creation of formal policies within legislatures, such as a maternity and/or parental leave policy and/or harassment policy, to changes to standing orders, childcare access, predictable sitting calendars, and the modernization of Parliament, such as e-voting. Equal Voice provided research and advice to multiple provincial legislatures and political parties, and testified at the federal Standing Committee on Human Resources, Skills and Social Development and the Status of Persons with Disabilities on Bill C-65, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code in regard to harassment and violence, the Parliamentary Employment and Staff Relations Act, and the Budget Implementation Act, 2017, No. 1.  Elections  Equal Voice provides data and analysis during, and following, provincial and federal elections. In 2019, they also provided a first-of-its kind directory of women running for all major political parties in the federal election, and blog content from prominent women in Canadian politics. In 2019, Equal Voice reported it was optimistic about reaching the 30% mark for women's representation in the House of Commons. However, on October 21st, 2019 just 98 women were elected to the House of Commons, up from 88 in 2015, falling short of the 102 needed to hit 30%.

Equal Voice Experiences is a national mentorship program funded by Status of Women Canada which aims to engage girls and young women between the ages of 12 and 25 to learn about the impact of politics on their lives and how they might become involved in the process. The Canada Challenge is intended to promote change among political parties to elect more women in Canada. In May 2009, EV launched its second Canada Challenge, where in anticipation of the next federal election, Equal Voice secured the commitment of the five federal party leaders to nominate more women to run for their parties. This resulted in an increase in the numbers of women nominated and elected in 2011, from 22 percent of parliament after the 2008 election to 25 percent of parliament after the 2011 election. The Ontario Challenge was created to help elect more women to Queen’s Park. In 2006, Equal Voice asked the leaders of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party, Liberals and New Democratic Party to commit to nominating more female candidates. All three party leaders agreed to take up the Challenge, and as a result, the number of women elected to Queen’s Park in one election cycle increased by 7 per cent overall. Getting to the Gate Online Campaign School, Getting to the Gate Online Campaign School is an online campaign school that provides practical tools for women of all ages, backgrounds and walks of life interested in running for public office in order to boost women’s participation in all levels of government. The course is led by Equal Voice and funded by Status and Women Canada, and was made possible by the contributions of many individuals and organizations.

The maximum prize for winning the show was . Selection Procedure Auditions are held in various major cities in India. People who turn up for the audition are made to undergo a group discussion, following which, selected candidates are chosen for personal interview conducted by Raghu Ram and Nikhil Chinapa. The interview round is deliberately acrimonious to test the participant's attitude, tolerance and patience levels. In the first two seasons, 7 Roadies were selected. Since then, this number has been increased to 13. There is no limit as to how many times a person can audition. Format The selected thirteen Roadies are given Hero Honda Karizma bikes to travel on a pre-decided route. Each episode features a vote-out at the end in which the roadies eliminate one of their fellow roadie, thereby decreasing the number of roadies carrying on with the journey. Each episode consists of number of tasks or challenges which they have to perform. These tasks can be either \\"Money tasks\\" or \\"Immunity tasks\\". In the \\"Money tasks\\", the roadies add cash to their account on successful completion of these tasks while in \\"Immunity tasks\\", the team which wins gets Immunity. The team which attains Immunity becomes safe from vote-out i.e. its members cannot be voted-out in that episode. The above-mentioned tasks are either team-based (i.e. performed between two or more teams) or individual- based (i.e. performed one-on-one). At the end of scheduled journey, the last roadie who survives till the end is declared the winner and walks away with the total cash accumulated by performing the money tasks. The fifth season is the first time when an advantage task is introduced. The winner/s of an advantage task get(s) some advantage in the vote out, which may include multiple votes or being the only one(s) to vote in the vote-out. The Indian version of the show is very slightly inspired by the MTV-USA reality show Road Rules (a spinoff of The Real World) which started in the year 1995. Contestants * 1. Varun * 2. Prabhjot * 3.

It was discovered on 27 October 1973, by German astronomer Freimut Börngen at the Karl Schwarzschild Observatory in Tautenburg, Germany. The assumed C-type asteroid belongs to the 50 largest Jupiter trojans and has a rotation period of 8.9 hours. It was named after the Greek hero Protesilaus from Greek mythology, the first Greek to set foot on the shores of Troy.  Orbit and classification  Protesilaos is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's Lagrangian point, 60° ahead of its orbit in a 1:1 resonance (see Trojans in astronomy). It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.7–5.9 AU once every 12 years and 1 month (4,425 days; semi-major axis of 5.27 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.12 and an inclination of 23° with respect to the ecliptic. A first precovery was taken at Palomar Observatory in February 1953, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 20 years prior to its official discovery observation at Tautenburg.  Physical characteristics  Protesilaos is an assumed, carbonaceous C-type asteroid, which is in line with the body's albedo (see below), while its V–I color index of 0.94 agrees with that of most Jovian D-type asteroids. = Rotation period = In March 1989 a rotational lightcurve of Protesilaos was obtained from photometric observations by astronomer Stefano Mottola at DLR Institute for Planetary Research. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 8.945 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.13 magnitude (). In October 2010, a second photometric measurement over two nights by Robert Stephens at the Goat Mountain Astronomical Research Station showed a concurring period of hours with no brightness variation given (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Protesilaos measures 70.22 and 87.66 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.062. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for a carbonaceous asteroid of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 76.84 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.3.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the hero Protesilaus from Greek mythology. In the Trojan War, he was the first Greek to set foot on the shores of Troy. He was later killed by the Trojan Aeneas, after whom one of the largest Jupiter trojans, 1172 Äneas, is named. Another Jupiter trojan, 13062 Podarkes, is named after his brother Podarkes.

Stratovolcanoes, also referred to as Composite Volcanoes, are the \\"iconically\\" conical-shaped volcanoes, found most commonly along subduction zones. Stratovolcanoes are composed of steeply dipping layers of lava, hardened ash, and other material that erupted from the main vent such as tephra and pumice.http://study.com/academy/lesson/stratovolcano-definition-formation- facts.html Commonly higher than 2500 meters above sea-level, Stratovolcanoes have gentle lower slopes which gradually become steeper the higher you get with a relatively small summit crater. Due to their eruptions, Stratovolcanoes have several distinct variations giving some a specific feature such as calderas and amphitheaters.http://www.basicplanet.com/stratovolcano/ In recorded history, volcanoes in subduction zones are known to have the most explosive eruptions causing the most danger to the surrounding civilization. These eruptions will generally produce pyroclastic flows containing toxic gas and hot volcanic fragment traveling at high speeds. Stratovolcanoes can erupt any kind of magma type although the lava usually cools and hardens not letting it get very far. Plate Boundary Tequila Volcano is located near the town of Tequila in the state of Jalisco, Mexico and it is the fourth highest of the state after Volcán Nevado de Colima, Volcán de Fuego and Cerro Viejo.http://www.summitpost.org/volc-n-de-tequila/792233 The Tequila Volcano is part of a chain of volcanoes parallel with the Middle America Trench, is a oceanic trench in the eastern Pacific Ocean off the southwestern coast of Middle America, stretching from central Mexico and Costa Rica. At least four different magmatic series has been discovered around Tequila volcano: the Santa Rosa intraplate basalts; a group of vitreous domes and flows of dacitic to rhyolitic compositions, pyroxene andesites and dacites with strong subduction signatures; and amphibole bearing andesites that erupted through the flanks of the main cone. History of the Tequila Volcano Compared to other types of volcanoes, the Tequila Volcano lived much longer and was more active since it is a stratovolcano.https://www.universetoday.com/27333/types- of-volcanoes/ There is no particular date of when exactly the volcano itself was active, but we can tell whether it was active or not according to its volcanic field and structure. The Tequila Volcano’s volcanic field is 1600 km^3, showing that it was active at one point in time, it is, however; no longer active. Although the volcano is now dormant, if it were to erupt, the explosion would be extremely violent. Just like Mount Fuji and St. Helens, stratovolcanoes tend to be very big because they have a conduit system inside them that channels magma from deep within the Earth to the surface. These type of volcanoes also have clusters of vents, with lava breaking through walls, or issuing from fissures on the sides of the mountain which allows them to grow big & very tall. Stratovolcanoes make up some of the world’s most memorable mountains as well as most violent eruptions, for example, on May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens erupted. The eruption covered approximately 230 square miles of a forest that was destroyed and the ash that was in the atmosphere drifted over 11 states with a total number of 57 casualties,http://www.livescience.com/27295-volcanoes.html however; when the Tequila Volcano erupted, there were no casualties. Tequila Volcano Today The Tequila Volcano does not pose a threat to surrounding communities. Being inactive for around 220,000 years it is now covered in vegetation and is easy to access. Visitors can drive to the volcano's crater without any concerns for safety.11 Volcanoes in the Americas That You Can Actually Climb. (2017). BootsnAll Travel Articles. Retrieved 9 May 2017, from http://www.bootsnall.com/articles/09-07/11-volcanoes-in-the-americas-that-you- can-climb.html The Volcano has contributed greatly towards an agave culture where Mexico relies on the rich soils that the volcano created to cultivate blue agave and create the beverage Tequila and Mescal. Tequila, Jalisco benefits greatly from the Tequila Volcano. When the volcano erupted, lava flowed where the town is located today and left enriched soils where blue agave can strive. Blue agave is the main ingredient for Mexico’s National drink, tequila. Agave is the dominant agriculture in Tequila, Jalisco; \\"roughly one-fourth of all inhabitants of Tequila work in the fields and at least another 1,200 work distilling, bottling, packaging, or promoting tequila.\\"Guadalupe, V.

It is similar to Cucurbita californica, Cucurbita cordata, Cucurbita cylindrata, and Cucurbita palmata and all these species hybridize readily. These species form the only restricted xerophyte species group in the genus Cucurbita. Each member of this species group is native to the Southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico where they are relatively uncommon. Each group member is found in hot, arid regions with low rainfall. They prefer soil that is loose, gravelly, and well-drained. C. digitata is native to northern Baja California at higher elevations, northern Sonora, Mexico, southern Arizona, and southwestern New Mexico. The juvenile leaves of C. cylindrata, C. cordata, C. digitata, and C. palmata show a high degree of similarity, but their mature leaves are visibly different, as are their root structures. C. palmata and C. digitata are sympatric, with C. palmata separating the ranges of C. digitata at the juncture of Baja California, California, and Arizona. C. digitata fruits are clear green mottle that turns yellow at maturity, striped, and round. It was first identified by Asa Gray in 1853. Description Cucurbita digitata is a hairy vining plant with sharply palmate leaves having five fingerlike lobes. It is quite similar in appearance to its close relative, the coyote gourd Cucurbita palmata, but the lobes of its leaves are usually more slender. It has curling yellow flowers up to 5 centimeters wide. The fruit is a dark green squash, rounded or nearly rounded, with mottling and distinct white stripes. The bitter fruit is very distasteful and generally not edible, although a few animals may hesitantly eat the flesh while trying to get at the seeds. Each white seed is about a centimeter long and at 35% protein and 50% fat is a nutritious food.

He is best known as the lead play-by- play announcer for local TV broadcasts of the Houston Dynamo and his weekly radio show titled \\"Soccer Matters with Glenn Davis\\" on KFNC. Davis has called World Cup matches for ESPN, Olympic soccer for NBC, and MLS matches on several national and local channels. Additionally, he has called professional women's soccer matches and men and women's collegiate soccer. A professional soccer player in the 1980s, Davis has also coached youth soccer and works as a consultant and spokesperson. His charitable work includes a youth soccer camp titled \\"Kick Cancer\\" that features former and current soccer players as coaches to raise money for pediatric cancer research. Soccer career Davis grew up playing youth soccer in New Jersey under the tutelage of Scottish coach Tom MacDonald, whom he credits for instilling the passion and excitement of the sport of soccer into his blood. Another influence was Davis' older brother Conn who was an All-American goalkeeper at Davis' alma-mater, Davis & Elkins College in West Virginia. Davis played collegiate soccer at Boston University and later at Davis & Elkins College, where he was a two-time All- WVIAC selection and a NAIA All-American. Davis began his professional career as a central defender for the Pennsylvania Stoners of the American Soccer League, with whom he reached the 1983 American Soccer League Final in his rookie season. The Stoners finished runner-up to the Jacksonville Tea Men, coached at the time by former Manchester United F.C. striker Dennis Viollet, after falling 1–0 in a decisive game three. Davis scored and was named 'Defensive Player of the Game' in game 1. The following year Davis played with the United Soccer League's Houston Dynamos. The Dynamos advanced to the 1984 league championship game but fell in the penalty shootout to the Fort Lauderdale Sun, whose squad featured former England captain Dave Watson, Scottish international Asa Hartford, and former Leicester City star Keith Weller. Davis earned All-League honors for the 1984 season. The following season Davis captained the team and played against well-known international clubs like Sheffield United F.C., Middlesbrough F.C., Linfield F.C., Glentoran F.C., C.D. FAS, Olympiakos F.C., and the U.S. national team, whom the Dynamos defeated 1–0.

At the start of Fox Sports World (now Fox Soccer Channel) he was a regular calling twice weekly Serie A games from Italy. He has called CONCACAF Champions League, CONCACAF Gold Cup and various tournaments internationally.

Davis hosts Dynamo All Access on Yahoo Sports 1560 and Soccer Matters on ESPN 97.5 FM. He originally started his radio show on 90.1 KPFT public radio in Houston. Davis used the platform to promote the sport and the return of professional soccer to Houston, which ultimately occurred with the San Jose Earthquakes being re-located to Houston in December 2005. He also created a Dynamo post- game radio show, modeled after other pro sports teams' show, which takes place live outside BBVA Compass Stadium after games. Davis is currently the number 2 announcer for MLS on ESPN, and also commentates on international matches for Fox. Davis is the lead play-by-play man for college soccer on ESPN.

A rendering of the Walsh crest displaying the Walsh motto, swan, and a variation of the name. Walsh is a common Irish surname, meaning \\"Briton\\" or \\"foreigner\\", literally \\"Welshman\\" or \\"Wales\\", taken to Ireland by soldiers from Britain, namely Welsh, Cornish and Cumbrian soldiers during and after the Norman invasion of Ireland. It is most common in County Mayo and County Kilkenny. It is the fourth most common surname in Ireland, and the 265th most common in the United States. There are variants including \\"Walshe\\", \\"Welsh\\", \\"Brannagh\\", and the Irish \\"Breathnach\\". Walsh is uncommon as a given name. The name is often pronounced \\"Welsh\\" in the south and west of the country.http://www.irishidentity.com/lists/w.htm Origins in Ireland There are several Walsh families in Ireland who have recognized coats of arms. These are the Walshs of Ballykilcaven in County Laois who's motto is \\"Firm\\" and their crest is a griffin's head. The Walshs of Castlehale in County Kilkenny have a crest with a swan pierced by an arrow, and their motto is \\"Pierced but not dead\\". The Walshs of Carrickmines Castle, County Dublin have a crest with a demi-lion rampant and their motto is \\"Do not irritate the lions\\". However, there were Walshs all over Ireland. One theory as to their origin is that they have a common ancestor in 'Walynus' who came to Ireland in the military retinue of Maurice FitzGerald, Lord of Lanstephan and it is from 'Walynus' who the famed Walsh of the Mountains family in County Kilkenny was established. Other sources suggest 'Phillip of Wales' who could have been the same person as 'Walynus' whose son, Howel, gave his name to their stronghold Castle Hoel, which was also known as Castlehale or Castlehowel. Other theories are that the Walshs originated from Pembrokeshire, that they had close ties with the barons of Cornwall or that they descended from Owen Gwynnes, a prince of north Wales. During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms the Walsh of the Mountains family in Kilkenny took up arms against Oliver Cromwell and as a result their stronghold of Castlehale was besieged and taken in 1650. The survivors were executed and thrown into a burial pit at the bottom of a hill near the castle. In the nineteenth century their remains were uncovered during road building near the hill.

The team's head coach was Mike Price. The Miners played their home games at the Sun Bowl Stadium in El Paso, Texas. UTEP averaged 37,296 fans per game, ranking 66th nationally.http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/Attendance/2008.pdf Schedule * Denotes the largest crowd ever for the Sun Bowl Stadium. Game summaries =Buffalo= In their first trip to the state of New York, UTEP rolled up 266 yards but had three turnovers while the Bulls' Drew Willy threw four touchdown passes to help Buffalo to a 42–17 victory over the Minders. Willy complete 10-of-16 passing attempts for 221 passing yards and no interceptions. His first completion of the game broke Cliff Scott's school record for career completions. The UTEP defense surrendered 484 total yards. =Texas= This game marks the first time for the Miners to play the Texas Longhorns. Texas holds a 2–0 record against the Miners, with the most recent game occurring in 1933 when the school was known as The Texas State School of Mines and Metallurgy. Besides both being in The University of Texas System the two schools also share the same alma mater, \\"The Eyes of Texas\\". While Miners' fans make a symbol called the \\"Pickaxe\\", with pinkie and thumb extended from a closed fist, the Longhorns have the Hook 'em Horns symbol. After the Miners opened their season with a loss to the Buffalo Bulls 42–17, Miners coach Mike Price said of the upcoming game against the Longhorns, \\"Man, I hope they're not as good as Buffalo.\\" The kickoff for the game was set for 8:00 pm local time (Mountain Time) which is an unusually late start and which translates to 9:00 pm in Austin. Sports analysts have speculated that the Miners' excitement for the game, the crowd noise, the distance traveled, and time may pose a problem for Texas. They have also compared the game to Texas' 2007 road trip to Central Florida, which was a very close win for Texas. Longhorn defensive coordinator Will Muschamp said of the time slot, \\"Doesn't matter where we play, who we play or what time we play, Texas defense is gonna show up and play.\\" The Dallas Morning News reported the game was one of the most anticipated games in UTEP history and \\"because season-ticket packages were available for $99, some Texas fans bought them in advance to avoid the hassle of a single-game purchase. The sales pushed UTEP to nearly 24,000 season tickets, a school record.\\" The morning of the game, Las Vegas sports books favored Texas by 27 points. The weather forecast called for a gametime temperature of and mostly clear skies. The attendance was 53,415, the largest crowd ever for the Sun Bowl Stadium. UTEP got the ball to start the game and scored a field goal. Texas was not able to secure a first down and punted back to Miners, who scored another field goal to take a 6–0 lead. On their second possession, Texas drove 80 yards for a touchdown on a McCoy pass to Quan Cosby. The extra point gave Texas a 7–6 lead which they still held at the end of the first quarter. The Longhorns scored again ten seconds into the second quarter, as McCoy threw a 12-yard touchdown to wide receiver Dan Buckner. The Miners attempted a 65-yard field goal, but it fell short and Quan Cosby returned it 65 yards. Texas put John Chiles in as quarterback on the next series, and fullback Cody Johnson scored his second rushing touchdown of the season to make the score 21–6. With four minutes to go in the half, McCoy threw a touchdown pass to tight end Blaine Irby to make the score 28–6 with the extra point. UTEP scored a touchdown with 18 seconds remaining in the half, making the score 28–13 at half-time. Texas got the ball to start the second half and drove to the UTEP 14-yard line when McCoy threw an interception in the UTEP end zone; it was his first interception of the season. Neither team scored in the third quarter. The Horns faked a wide receiver screen and scored on a McCoy pass to Jordan Shipley to extend the lead to 35–13. On the next Miner possession, Emmanuel Acho forced a fumble and Roddrick Muckelroy returned it for a touchdown, making the score 42–13. UTEP missed a field goal to end their next possession. Texas punted on their next possession, and then took over on downs when UTEP was unable to score on their last possession. The Horns kept the ball on the ground and ran out the clock. =NMSU= Chase Holbrook passed for 329 yards and five touchdowns to lead New Mexico State to a 34–33 win Saturday over UTEP. Holbrook connected with wide receiver Marcus Anderson on three scores, including the go-ahead touchdown with 3:12 to go in the game. Anderson finished with five catches for 70 yards. Holbrook has 1,269 passing yards in three games against the Miners (0–3). With the win, NMSU (1–1) snapped a six-game losing streak, while UTEP extended its losing skid to nine games. It was the Aggies' first win in the Sun Bowl since 1994. In the second quarter, NMSU went up 14–10 on a pair of passing scores from Holbrook to Anderson. UTEP quarterback James Thomas II answered with a 44-yard scoring run, but NMSU went ahead 21–17 on a 27-yard touchdown reception by A.J. Harris. UTEP's Jose Martinez kicked a 36-yard field goal to make it 21–20 with 3:05 remaining in the half. The Aggies took a 28–27 lead into the fourth quarter, until Thomas stretched into the end zone from a yard out and put UTEP back up 33–28. NMSU went ahead for good on Holbrook's final touchdown pass to Anderson. The Aggie defense forced a UTEP fumble, then stopped the Miners on a fourth-and-11 in the final minute. UTEP' top two running backs were out with injuries and starting quarterback Trevor Vittatoe left the game for good with an ankle injury after the third series. Thomas led UTEP with 142 yards rushing and two scores, becoming only the third Miner quarterback to eclipse the 100-yard mark since 1982. =UCF= Trevor Vittatoe threw for 263 yards and three touchdowns to lead UTEP to a 58–13 win over Central Florida on Saturday night, halting a streak of nine consecutive losses. Jose Martinez kicked a 64-yard field goal for the Miners (1–3, 1–0 Conference USA). Cornelius Brown, who had two interceptions and blocked a punt, led the UTEP defense as it forced UCF (1–3, 0–1) into six turnovers, including two fumbles recovered for touchdowns. Vittatoe's second-quarter scoring pass to Jamar Hunt gave UTEP a 17-point lead, and Martinez' 64-yarder gave the Miners a 27–7 lead at halftime. Rob Calabrese, making his first start for UCF, threw for 167 yards and a touchdown. =Southern Miss= Trevor Vittatoe threw four touchdown passes, including the game winner in double overtime, as UTEP defeated Southern Mississippi 40–37 on Saturday night. Vittatoe hit Chris Adams on a 7-yard touchdown pass in the second overtime, after Southern Miss' Britt Barefoot gave the Golden Eagles a 37–34 lead with a 28-yard field goal. It was the second consecutive victory for UTEP (2–3, 2–0 Conference USA) and the second straight loss for the Golden Eagles (2–3, 0–2). Southern Miss is 0–2 in league play for the first time in the 13-year history of Conference USA. The loss overshadowed a career-high effort by Damion Fletcher, who had 34 carries for 260 yards, becoming the program's all-time leading rusher in the third quarter. He has 3,654 career yards, passing Ben Garry, who finished with 3,595. The 260-yard effort was also the second highest single-game mark in school history. Vittatoe was 24 of 41 for 263 yards and four scores. The Miners led 17–14 at halftime, thanks to a 37-yard field goal by Jose Martinez with 1:25 to go in the second quarter. Fletcher gave USM an early lead on a 1-yard scoring run five minutes into the game. Justin Estes missed a pair of short field goals for the Golden Eagles in the first half, one after Fletcher ran 56 yards to the Miners' 13. Tory Harrison also had a 1-yard scoring run for USM in the second quarter. The Miners responded with a 10-yard touchdown pass from Vittatoe to Adams and an 11-yard touchdown run by Donald Buckram in the first half. Martinez made the score 20–14 with a 34-yard field goal at the 11:33 mark of the third quarter. UTEP tried an onside kick that USM recovered at midfield. The Golden Eagles took advantage of it to take the lead with a 10-yard scoring pass from Austin Davis to Shawn Nelson. The Miners came back with a 13-yard touchdown pass from Vittatoe to Tufick Shadrawy on the first play of the fourth quarter for a 27–21 lead. But Barefoot replaced Estes in the second half, and despite missing his first attempt, kicked a pair of short field goals in the fourth quarter. The second, from 22 yards out on the final play of regulation, sent the game into overtime. The teams traded 4-yard scoring passes in the first overtime, as Vittatoe hit Terrell Jackson and USM's Austin Davis found DeAndre Brown. =Tulane= Trevor Vittatoe threw three touchdown passes as UTEP came back for a 24–21 win over Tulane on Saturday night. Vittatoe finished 21-of-32 passing for 296 yards. The Miners (3–3, 3–0 Conference USA) reached .500 after an 0–3 start for the first time in school history. Andre Anderson, who entered the game as the nation's ninth-leading rusher, carried the ball 29 times for 255 yards and two touchdowns for Tulane (2–4, 1–2). UTEP took an early 7–0 lead, scoring on its opening possession for the first time this season. Following rushing scores of 72 and 28 yards by Anderson, UTEP tied it 14–14 in the second quarter after Daniel Palmer hauled in a low pass and scurried 8 yards to the end zone. Down 21–14 at halftime, UTEP inched back on a 28-yard field goal from Jose Martinez in the third quarter, then took the lead for good on a 68-yard bomb to Jeff Moturi with 4:22 remaining in the game. =Tulsa= David Johnson threw for 434 yards and five touchdowns to help lead Tulsa to a record-setting performance and a 77–35 blowout of UTEP. Brennan Marion had six catches for 233 yards and three touchdowns Saturday night, setting a Conference USA record for yards per catch in a game (38.8), as Tulsa (7–0, 4–0 CUSA) strengthened its case to move into the national rankings. The Golden Hurricane hovered just outside the Associated Press poll this week. Tulsa amassed 791 total yards, including 321 rushing. UTEP (3–4, 3–1 CUSA) kept pace with Tulsa early and the game was tied 28–28 in the first quarter. David Johnson connected with Marion on passes of 97 and 51 yards; Damaris Johnson returned a kickoff 94 yards for a score and A.J. Whitmore caught a 24-yard strike from David Johnson, who finished 21-for-27 with one interception. UTEP quarterback Trevor Vittatoe hit Jeff Moturi with a 6-yard pass, Kris Adams with a 22-yard strike and a 1-yarder to Jamar Hunt for a score. He finished 21 of 34 for 321 yards and four touchdowns. By the second quarter, Tulsa had turned up the heat, rattling Vittatoe with a variety of blitzes and holding the Miners scoreless, while the Golden Hurricane scored 28 consecutive points. Tarrion Adams, who finished with 115 yards, scored two touchdown in the third quarter that gave Tulsa a 63–35 advantage and UTEP lost all fight after that. Marion added a 40-yard touchdown before the quarter ended to make it 70–35. =Rice= Chase Clement threw for 372 yards and accounted for six TDs, and Rice matched its best conference record in nearly a half-century with a 49–44 win over Texas-El Paso on Saturday night. Clement threw five TD passes and ran for a 3-yard score that gave Rice the lead for good in the second quarter. UTEP kept close, and a third touchdown pass from Trevor Vittatoe to Jeff Moturi with 1:23 left gave the Miners hope before their onside kick attempt failed. Rice (6–3, 5–1 Conference USA) clinched bowl eligibility for the second time in three seasons. Not since 1960 have the Owls been 5–1 in conference play. =Louisiana-Lafayette= Trevor Vittatoe threw touchdown passes to each team as UTEP finished the first quarter tied 7–7 with Louisiana-Lafayette. Gerren Blount intercepted Vittatoe and returned it 55 yards for the opening score, but UTEP answered with 1:51 left in the first quarter on Jeff Moturi's fifth touchdown reception in the last three games. It came from 16 yards out. Moturi's 20th career touchdown catch put him all alone in third on UTEP's all-time list. By Halftime, The UTEP defense played perhaps its best half of the season, holding the Louisiana-Lafayette to three offensive points and the Miners led 16–10 at the intermission. In the Second Quarter, Trevor Vittatoe threw touchdown passes to Tufick Shadrawy and Jeff Moturi, but also threw one to the Rajin' Cajuns' Gerren Blount to open the scoring. UTEP answered with 1:51 left in the first quarter on Jeff Moturi's fifth touchdown reception in the last three games. It came from 16 yards out. Moturi's 20th career touchdown catch put him all alone in third on UTEP's all- time list. The Miners also made a goal-line stand shortly before their final touchdown of the half, which came with 51 seconds left on a 32-yard field goal. Miners defeat Louisiana-Lafayette LAFAYETTE, La. – The UTEP football team picked up its second road win of the year on Saturday with a 37–24 victory against Louisiana-Lafayette at Cajun Field. The Miners improved to 4–5 overall with the win in the non-conference game. UTEP is 3–2 in Conference USA going into next week's Conference USA home game against SMU. The Ragin' Cajuns fell to 5–4 on the season and saw a four-game win streak come to an end. However, the loss didn't affect the team's Sun Belt Conference mark, which remained at 4–0. The win allowed UTEP to keep alive hopes of qualifying for a bowl game this season. UTEP needs two more wins in its final three games to qualify for one. After hosting SMU next week, the Miners finish the season with road trips to Houston and East Carolina. =SMU= Trevor Vittatoe threw for 410 yards and connected with Kris Adams for three touchdowns to lead UTEP to a 36–10 victory over SMU on Saturday night. Vittatoe completed 21-of-31 passes, finishing his evening after just three-quarters. Adams caught five of those passes for 145 yards and the three touchdowns. It was a career-high for Vittatoe and Adams, both sophomores. Vittatoe connected with Adams for an 85-yard touchdown pass on UTEP's first play from scrimmage. The Miners (5–5, 4–2 Conference USA) rolled up 544 total yards and never trailed, leading 10–3 after one quarter and 26–3 at the half. Jose Martinez kicked five field goals in the game, connecting from 34, 48, 26, 31 and 23 yards. SMU (1–10, 0–7) scored its lone touchdown in the fourth quarter after trailing 36–3. Logan Turner hit Bradley Haynes with a 27-yard pass for the touchdown. =Houston= UTEP Miners at Robertson Stadium in Houston Although meeting for the first time during the Cougars' inaugural season in 1946, the UTEP Miners had only met with the Cougars five times in history.[40] As Conference USA foes, the Cougars held a 2–3 all-time record against the Miners, whereas both wins came consecutively during the 2006 and 2007 meetings of the teams. Mike Price returned as the Miners' head coach this season. After a close game, where Houston lagged behind, the Cougars made a fourth quarter comeback to win the game. =East Carolina= The Pirates welcome the Miners to Greenville for the first time ever. East Carolina and this Conference USA West opponent are meeting for the second time. The first meeting occurred last fall in El Paso, Texas. ECU won in overtime, 45–42 in the Sun Bowl.

The leading characters include Gemma Doyle herself, who is able to enter the magical \\"Realms\\"; Ann Bradshaw, Felicity Worthington and Pippa Cross, Gemma's fellow-students at the boarding school Spence Academy; some of the staff at that school, including the evil \\"Circe\\"; and members of \\"The Order\\", a secret society. Male characters include Kartik and other members of the \\"Rakshana\\". There are also characters drawn from upper-class English society. Supernatural beings play an important role in the story—centaurs and forest people, a Gorgon, lost souls called \\"Winterland creatures\\" and \\"Trackers\\", and the skeletal \\"Poppy Warriors\\". Protagonists = Gemma Doyle= Gemma Doyle (born in Shropshire, June 21, 1879) is the heroine of Libba Bray's novels A Great and Terrible Beauty, Rebel Angels, and The Sweet Far Thing. She is described as being rather tall, taller than most of her peers, with \\"pale\\" skin, a \\"decent\\" profile, and \\"a straight nose and a good jaw\\".Bray, Libba. Rebel Angels What differentiates her most from others is perhaps her mane of red hair and brilliant green eyes, two assets that she inherited from her mother. Life Gemma lived most of her life in India. In June 1895, Gemma's mother, Virginia Doyle, is killed after hearing that someone named Circe is near, leaving Gemma with her strange amulet in the shape of the Crescent Eye. The Doyle family moves back to England. Gemma, then only sixteen, is sent to Spence Academy rather abruptly. Her first friend there is roommate and scholarship student Ann Bradshaw, and shortly after, she meets witty and wealthy Felicity Worthington and the beautiful, but shallow, Pippa Cross, at that time Felicity's best friend. All four girls strike up a rather unconventional relationship as they find themselves entangled in the mysterious Order. Shortly after the death of her mother, Gemma starts having strange visions that show her frightening images. Kartik, a member of the Rakshana who is supposedly protecting her, tells her she is a member of the Order, just like her mother. From her visions, Gemma is able to navigate herself and her friends into a strange world called the realms, where they have absolute power over everything. It is in the realms that she meets up with what she believes to be her dead mother, and the two devise a plan to defeat Circe, an evil member of the Order who wishes to take the power away from Gemma, and her ruthless assassins. However, the power of the Order lies within their ability to make illusions, and Gemma soon realizes that the mother she meets in the realms is not the mother she knew during her lifetime. She discovers from a diary that Virginia Doyle is actually Mary Dowd, who, along with her best friend, Sarah Rees-Toome, became entangled in the power that the realms, the Winterlands, and the Order offered them. While Mary escaped and was reborn as Virginia, her greatest friend, Sarah, turned into Circe. The illusion of Virginia Doyle is destroyed in A Great and Terrible Beauty along with Circe's assassin in a fight with Gemma, but in the process, Pippa decides against returning to the mortal worlds and Gemma leaves her behind, effectively killing her. At the end of the next novel, Rebel Angels, Gemma has a new mission—to piece together a new Order, one free of corruption and with new members, much to the chagrin of former Order priestesses like Claire McCleethy. Also unique in Gemma's life is her relationship with Kartik, a member of the mysterious Rakshana who is apparently trying to protect her. In Rebel Angels, Kartik's true assignment—to have Gemma bind the magic of the realms in the name of the Rakshana, then kill her—is discovered by Gemma, who believes that he has betrayed her. Kartik, however, insists that he never would have done it and proves his honesty by helping Gemma escape the Rakshana when they imprison her, causing him to become one of their enemies and forcing him to turn his back on everything he has ever known. In the books, it is obvious that Gemma and Kartik both feel something beyond their platonic relationship, but as Kartik is Indian and Gemma is a proper English young lady, she would be sacrificing her and her family's reputation if she chooses to be with him. In The Sweet Far Thing Gemma and Kartik finally admit their feelings and have a romantic relationship. As a result, Kartik agrees to let Gemma show him the realms. They place their hands inside a special circle in the Cave of Sighs, giving them the ability to appear in the other's dreams. It is inferred that they make love for the first time. During the battle with The Tree Of All Souls, Gemma is stabbed by Amar and her blood is spilled on the ground of the Winterlands, damning her to become one with the Tree. Kartik gives up his life in exchange for Gemma's, taking her place inside of the Tree. After making her debut, Gemma decides to move to America to live independently and attend University, instead of continuing her season with the other young ladies her age. It is revealed that she is visited in her dreams by Kartik, who waits to be reunited with her. Throughout the series, Gemma struggles with her fears that she does not fit in anywhere and that she is not truly loved or valued by anyone. She has strained relationships with her critical grandmother, her brother, whose interests lie mainly in appearances and social climbing, and her father, who tries to avoid painful memories of his wife, Gemma's mother. =Ann Bradshaw= Ann Bradshaw (born c. 1879), along with Gemma Doyle, Felicity Worthington, and Pippa Cross, is one of the lead characters of Libba Bray's novels A Great and Terrible Beauty, Rebel Angels, and The Sweet Far Thing. Annie (Ann) Bradshaw's name comes from Hebrew; it means \\"favored grace\\". Her surname, Bradshaw, means \\"from the broad forest.\\" In Rebel Angels, Gemma, Felicity, and Ann make anagrams of their names. Ann's name becomes Nan Washbrad; she is the only one of the girls whose anagram \\"sounds like an actual name.\\"The Sweet Far Thing, Chapter 25 left Ann is described as being plain—with \\"dull, watery eyes\\"Bray, Libba. A Great and Terrible Beauty—and poor which furthermore condemns her to the low class. Gemma says in more or less words that if Ann had finer features she'd have a chance to marry out of her class and avoid her fate as a governess. She has mousy brown hair and a runny nose, which she tells Gemma in A Great and Terrible Beauty is not a cold. Her heart's desire is \\"to be beautiful\\" (A Great and Terrible Beauty. Chapter 13). Education Ann attends Spence Academy, where she has been for many years. She was sent to Spence as a \\"scholarship pupil\\" by her nouveau riche aunt and uncle who wish Ann to be well-learned; they can then employ her as an unpaid governess for their odious children. Ann is thankful for this measly bit of a sacrifice, but she wishes that she had her parents alive and well so that she could marry a respectable young man, and live her life to the fullest like the young, rich, and well- bred English girls around her. Ann managed to stay fairly invisible while at school. The only subject that she stood out in was singing; Ann proved to have a beautiful voice. She lacked the money and beauty of the other girls, and so lacked friends. She was often bullied by the other girls, especially Felicity Worthington, and Pippa Cross. In 1895, however, when Ann was fifteen, a new girl came to Spence. Gemma Doyle became Ann's roommate. A friendship formed by virtue of their having no other friends and of being roommates. When Felicity came into Gemma's debt, Gemma became friend with Felicity and Pippa, under condition that they would befriend Ann, too. This relationship, first one of obligation, later became real. The girls bonded, and came to love each other. In December of that year, Felicity even took Ann home with her over Christmas break, as Ann would otherwise have had to stay at their school. There they tried to pass her off as the grand-niece of the Duke of Chesterfield but before returning home they are found out and Ann is then ruined. Ann, knowing she was poor, plain, had no future prospects, was depressed. So in secret, she would use her sewing needle to cut scratches in her wrist. But when Gemma discovers this, she makes Ann swear to stop cutting herself. Ann has a crush on Tom Doyle from the first moment they meet in the first book and those feelings are very briefly matched in Rebel Angels, until Tom finds out she is not a rich and grand lady like she portrayed. In the third book she disguises herself in magic and becomes the beautiful Nan Washbrad. Ann, Gemma, and Felicity go to see Macbeth and have a chance encounter with an American actress who recommends Ann for an acting spot with Mr. Katz. When she goes to meet Mr. Katz he is thrilled with her beauty and talents. However he puts much emphasis on her pretty face and not her natural acting skills or her beautiful voice. Ann realizes that he would hire her for looks instead of her talent. Afraid that she would not be accepted as she was, she decides not to join the theatre after all, and asks for her horrible cousins to pick her up early from school and begin her life as a governess. However, Felicity and Gemma intervene, retrieving Ann from her cousins' country house, Balmoral Spring. Ann, along with Gemma, auditions again as herself for Mr. Smalls, a composer who had worked with Mr. Katz. Pleased, he grants her a supporting role in his new musical, The Merry Maidens.The Sweet Far Thing, Chapter 71 =Felicity Worthington= Felicity \\"Fee\\" Mildrade Worthington (born c. 1878) is one of the main characters in Libba Bray's novels A Great and Terrible Beauty, Rebel Angels, and The Sweet Far Thing. Felicity, though not as beautiful as Pippa, is considered sensuous and physically attractive. She has small grey eyes, \\"framed in arched eyebrows\\", set \\"in a face so pale it's almost the color of an opal.\\" She is also described as having white-blond hair (which is also, at times, is described as golden), full lips, and a fully developed, voluptuous figure. Felicity's first name, ironically, means \\"happy\\". Her surname, Worthington, is Anglo-Saxon; it means \\"from the river's side\\".Baby Names, Baby Name Meanings & Origins (page 21) This makes sense, as Felicity claims that her middle name, Mildrade, is \\"an old family name\\" that \\"can be traced all the way back to the Saxons\\". Mildrade is probably a form of the Old English name Mildred, which means \\"gentle and strong.\\" In Rebel Angels, Felicity, Ann, and Gemma make anagrams of their names. Felicity's is Maleficent Oddity Ralingworth. This name is declared \\"perfect\\" for Felicity—for, as Gemma says, it is \\"evil and odd\\". Before trying to make an anagram with Felicity's middle name included, the best that Ann could find was City Worth Gin If Lento and Wont Left in City Groh, neither of which would work as names. One of Felicity's defining characteristics is her strength, both physical and emotional. However, any reminder of \\"weakness\\" she has shown in the past (for example, her father's sexual abuse of her as a child) causes her to become enraged or depressed, or both. She is constantly trying to strengthen herself, and gives her greatest desire as \\"to be too powerful to ignore.\\"A Great and Terrible Beauty, Chapter 13 As such, she is the most popular girl at Spence Academy, and in A Great and Terrible Beauty often hazes Gemma and Ann as a senior would do to those younger than her. Felicity's father is Admiral Worthington, who is famous for his good looks and heroic deeds in the navy. He is also a pedophile. Felicity's mother is Lady Worthington, who left their family for a French artist in Paris. Felicity also has a younger cousin named Polly, who Admiral Worthington took in at the age of six. He also chronically abuses her. When, in The Sweet Far Thing, Felicity and Gemma encounter her, she is severely depressed and seems to be confused about the difference between her and her doll, who Admiral Worthington tells her is a wicked reflection of herself. Felicity also suffers from feelings of guilt and self- loathing because of her feelings for other girls as well as for boys. In the strict Victorian society, she has been told that homosexuality/bisexuality is wicked, and that she is \\"degenerate.\\" She also feels guilt because of her father's sexual abuse of her, as a small child—he told her that she \\"[brought] it out in him,\\" and so Felicity grew up blaming herself and trying to believe that her father really did care about her as his child, and not just as something to abuse. One of Felicity's most prominent characteristics is her bold sexual manner, which is mostly displayed in A Great and Terrible Beauty, brags to her friends about how many men she plans to have, and regularly meets Ithal, a gypsy boy, in the woods. Although not proven, this can almost certainly be traced back to her abusive childhood, when after she grew to be 'too old,' her father completely ignored her. Felicity's personality bears a strong resemblance to Gemma's mother's friend Sarah. Unfortunately, Sarah went mad when she felt that she was losing the power of the realms and became Circe. Sarah showed signs of paranoia and jealousy of Gemma's mother Mary, both of which Felicity has occasionally shown of Gemma, though she was quick to hide it (Gemma can enter the Realms on her own, but Felicity can only go if Gemma takes her, a fact she resents as she hates being dependent on anyone). Finally, Felicty's act of ruthlessly hunting and sacrificing a deer to gain access to the realms parallels Sarah's sacrifice of a Gypsy child; the parallel is heightened by the respective narrators' (Gemma and Mary) feelings of anxiety and foreboding. Unlike Sarah, however, Felicity does not betray Gemma. Felicity has a strong sense of loyalty; when forced to permanently choose sides in The Sweet Far Thing, Felicity stays with Gemma and Ann—though Pippa, with whom she is in love, is on the opposing side. Felicity's loyalty comes out in many other ways—she is always quick to defend her friends, both verbally and physically, when they are threatened in the Realms but can be hypocritical. Life Four unknown female archers of Felicity's generation Felicity, though very rich, had a miserable childhood. Her father molested her, and Lady Worthington, Felicity's mother, largely ignored both this and everything else relating to her daughter. Admiral Worthington convinced his daughter, then a very small girl, that the abuse was her fault, not his, saying that she \\"brings it out in him.\\" In Rebel Angels, Felicity defends her father's actions, telling her friend Gemma that \\"he didn't mean it.\\" When Felicity was quite young, just after a family holiday to Scotland, Lady Worthington left her husband and daughter and eloped to France with an artist, where she was a \\"paid consort\\"A Great and Terrible Beauty, Chapter 20 and ran an artist's salon. Felicity is forced to hide her mother's infidelity and abandonment; it cannot be known that Lady Worthington is a \\"courtesan\\" or a \\"whore.\\" Felicity is hurt by her mother's abandonment—first in not doing anything when Felicity told her of Admiral Worthington's abuse, and later for \\"[running] away and leaving [Felicity] behind.\\"A Great and Terrible Beauty, Chapter 16 Fee does not see her mother or father for three years at one point—until Christmastime in 1895. Despite this, she holds out hope, while her mother is away, that \\"she will send for [Felicity]\\" (though, as Pippa points out, Lady Worthington \\"couldn't even be bothered to send anything for [Felicity's] birthday\\").A Great and Terrible Beauty, Chapter 16 Felicity has attended Spence Academy ever since her mother ran off to Paris. At Spence, girls learn few subjects that will be useful to them, as fine ladies who needn't work for a living. Amongst other things, students study singing and ballroom dancing. Felicity, although quite intelligent and a perfectionist, is not especially good at either subject. She has proved proficient in French, however; Felicity's French is \\"absolutely flawless\\".A Great and Terrible Beauty, Chapter Nine She also is a fairly talented painter, once painting a castle from the Realms into the \\"pastoral scenes befitting a paradise\\" that are to be used as decoration at a ball.The Sweet Far Thing, Chapter 31 She is fiercely loyal, though it is a rather contradictory statement as in the first book, she abandons Pippa in a heartbeat to keep Gemma from telling of her relationship with Ithal after Gemma caught them both in the boathouse. In other manners, however, Fee is intensely endearing. Most of the comic relief in the novels comes from her, especially her witty and sarcastic comments, as in The Sweet Far Thing when she addresses Simon Middleton with: \\"Jaunty hat Simon, did you get it at a bandstand?\\" She also leads the other girls as sheep, pressing Ms. Moore for answers in the first novel, fighting the poppy warriors when even Gemma wants to give up and making up her own \\"Order\\" by forcing the girls to sneak out into a cave for their secret club. Some people, however, see Fee as too harsh and demanding, when her dominant and usually bubbly personality takes a turn for the morose. However, her commanding attitude foreshadowed her past from the start, especially when she said, \\"No. No admirals,\\" when asked about what kinds of men she would \\"have.\\" Her promiscuous and sometimes bullying attitude is an obvious cry for attention from the two parents who ignore her. Instead, she has to turn to Gemma to find friendship and strength once again. One of the more interesting and engaging characters, she has depth and emotion that neither Ann nor Pippa ever have. In the Realms, Felicity studies archery under a lone, Artemis-like huntress. While not initially perfect, Felicity, determined to be powerful, soon improves. In Rebel Angels, a new teacher, Miss McCleethy, introduces archery to the students; Felicity, of course, is the best of the girls and claims that this is \\"because she expects to win.\\" Felicity is revealed to be either bisexual or a lesbian (although most likely lesbian as she seemed to use men as a cover up) in the last book when she shares a passionate kiss with Pippa, before leaving the corrupt Pippa behind forever. Fee expects Ann and Gemma to \\"despise\\" her and agree that \\"[her] affections are unnatural.\\"The Sweet Far Thing, Chapter 57 Instead, Ann and Gemma stick by her. Having lost her first love, Felicity doesn't think that she can love ever again, at least \\"not [as much as she loved Pippa].\\" At the end of The Sweet Far Thing, however, Felicity plans on going to Paris with Polly, where she hopes to meet \\"others like her\\" and suspects that she will, in time, be able to fall in love again. In A Great and Terrible Beauty, Felicity is the only girl to know what a \\"Sapphist\\" is, explaining to the others that \\"Sapphists prefer the love of women to men.\\" Felicity expresses her sexual vibrance with men, particularly Ithal, who loves her more than she even cares for him, to hide the fact that she is, in fact, a \\"degenerate\\", and in love with Pippa. Felicity has many opinions that are, for her day and age, quite radical. She vows to have a \\"new suit of trousers... fashioned in Paris\\" and doesn't see why a woman \\"has to give up her name.\\"The Sweet Far Thing, Chapter 74 She also speaks of perhaps becoming a painter or an artist's model, once she lives in Paris.The Sweet Far Thing, Chapter 72 =Felicity's suitors= *Ithal is a young, handsome Gypsy who lived in the woods near Spence in September 1895. Felicity, infatuated with breaking rules, sometimes would meet Ithal in the woods. She was not as in love with him as Ithal was with her, however, and later insulted and ignored him, causing Ithal to leave the Spence campus, dejected. He returns later in The Sweet Far Thing, showing an open dislike of Felicity before he is killed and captured by creatures from the Winterlands. *The Honorable Simon Middleton \\"meant to court\\" Felicity, whom he had known his whole life. She refused him in 1894. As consequence, \\"he doesn't much care for\\" Felicity,The Sweet Far Thing, Chapter 38 and goes on to court first Gemma and then Lucy Fairchild, an American heiress to whom he later becomes engaged. *Horace Markham is the son of Felicity's sponsor, Lady Markham. It is planned that Felicity and Horace will become betrothed, but when Felicity reveals to Horace that she doesn't feel that way towards him, he tells her that he feels the same. *Pippa Cross is a long time friend of Felicity. Their friendship soon grew into something more, making the truth be known about both Pippa and Felicity. This only ends with the final death of Pippa Cross. =Pippa Cross= Pippa \\"Pip\\" Cross (c. 1878- September 1895) is one of the main characters in A Great and Terrible Beauty, Rebel Angels, and The Sweet Far Thing, all by Libba Bray. Pippa is the most beautiful woman in Libba Bray's alternate world. She has violet eyes (sometimes also said to be dark blue), perfectly curled dark hair (sometimes said to be brown; sometimes, black), and \\"an ivory face that could be from a cameo pin\\". She is also described as dainty and is said to have a 16.5 inch waist (when corseted). In Pippa's own words, \\"Being beautiful creates problems. It's misery.\\" A classical young woman on a cameo, of the sort to which Pippa was compared Pippa's first name means \\"lover of horses\\". While it may have been short for Philippa, this is never stated in any of the novels. Pippa is not a very widely used name and, though it comes from the Greek language, is predominantly an English name. Pippa's surname, Cross, refers to a place where two roads intersect, or where a cross could be erected—also, often at a crossroads.Cross: Surname Origin & Last Name Meaning Ancestor Search This may refer to how torn Pippa is, between her duty (marriage) and desire (freedom to find true love). Later, after her death, Pippa will also fear to \\"cross over\\", from the Realms, into wherever the dead go. Childhood Pippa, like Felicity and Ann, did not have a happy childhood. Because of her good looks, \\"everyone wanted to own\\" her, \\"constantly fussing over [her] so there was no room to breathe.\\" Pippa suffered from epilepsy, a fact that her mother insisted she hide. If anyone knew that Pippa was not perfectly healthy, she would be unlikely to marry well. Pippa's mother told her that if she felt a fit \\"coming on\\", she was to say that she had \\"a headache and excuse herself\\"—something that, of course, would not be possible. From a young age, probably about age seven, Pippa attended Spence Academy. Though she was easily the most beautiful-looking girl at the school, and one of the most popular, she did not stand-out for her wit. \\"I'm not clever like you are\\", Pippa once tells Ann. \\"I don't mean half of what I say.\\" Engagement and Death On the September Assembly Day of 1895, Pippa became engaged to Mr Bartleby Bumble, Esquire. It was not a happy occasion for Pippa, but Pippa's family informs her that she must marry to save the family from ruin. Despite her daughter's longing for true love, Mrs. Cross insists that love, desire, and marriage are not at all related; she assures Pippa that, one day, she will thank her for insisting on the marriage to Mr Bumble. A desperate Pippa is able to break off her engagement by telling Bumble of her illness. Bumble is described to see Pippa as a \\"fine piece of china\\" that he has purchased which has a very bad crack. He is relieved to know of this before the wedding and plans to forget about the wedding. However, when he informs Mr. and Mrs. Cross of his plans, they tell Mr. Bumble that Pippa got cold feet and lied about her condition. Mr. Bumble agrees again to marry her. While the girls are in the realms, they are attacked by the creature that killed Gemma's mother. Pippa runs off and Gemma can only take Ann and Felicity back; Pippa remains trapped in the realms. In the real world, Pippa has had an epileptic fit and Gemma goes back to the realms to try and save her friend. She finds Pippa, but Pippa refuses to return to the real world where she is seen as no more than a pretty face to be sold to the highest bidder for a loveless marriage. Despite Gemma's insistence that the realms were \\"not a place to stay\\", being only a \\"place of dreams\\", Pip merely asks what would happen if she \\"chose the dream instead?\\" In an attempt to save herself from her horrible fate in the real world, Pippa eats berries from the realm, causing her real body, back at Spence, to die. Pippa then leaves Gemma, heading off with a knight in shining armor, a romantic fantasy she conjured up in an earlier trip to the realms. Pippa is buried wearing her engagement ring, to the displeasure of Mr. Bumble. Corruption In Rebel Angels, Pippa, who wants to stay in the beautiful realms forever, is being slowly corrupted, as do all spirits who decide to stay within the realms instead of crossing over. She learns she must either decide to cross over or join the other corrupted spirits in the Winterlands. Pippa, however is determined to stay in the realms and runs off to the Winterlands when she learns that Gemma cannot help her with her magic. When Gemma, Felicity, and Ann are visiting the realms in The Sweet Far Thing, they find Pippa with a group of girls she claims to have been saved from entering the Winterlands. Pippa leads the group of girls and attempts to teach them manners in a similar fashion that she was taught at Spence. Pippa asks Gemma to help her cross over from the realms into a 'heaven' like area but finds that she cannot because she has been in the realms too long. This causes her a great deal of distress and a guilt-ridden Gemma begins giving her an allowance of magic to help her get through the sadness. Pippa then grows more powerful after she gives sacrifices to the Tree of All Souls in the Winterlands. She decides that the realms have chosen her, and fights to keep Felicity with her forever and to have the girls follow her. She is destroyed when the ruined castle she and the other spirits live in crumbles, entombing her with it. In The Sweet Far Thing, it is officially revealed that Pippa and Felicity are in love when the two share a passionate kiss. In the same novel, it is stated by Gemma that Pippa was able to stay uncorrupted for so long because of the love that Pippa and Felicity shared. Staff at Spence Mrs. Eugenia Spence - The founder of Spence Academy for Young Girls. She is the most respected member of the Order. She sacrifices her own life for Sarah Rees-Toome and Mary Dowd.

She commands her creatures to go after Gemma Doyle in order to obtain the magic of the Realms. Mrs. Lillian Nightwing- The headmistress of Spence's Academy for Girls. She was an initiate of the Order but her power faded and she lived the life of a lady instead. It is told that after the death of her husband the young widow returned, as a teacher, to Spence.

She is very loyal to her school, and protects it when under siege by the Winterlands creatures. Miss Hester Asa Moore (Sarah Rees- Toome/Circe) - A teacher at Spence Academy who was formally Sarah Reese-Toome, presumed to be dead in the fire of the East Wing in 1871. She becomes the villain Circe who remains as the main antagonist of the story.

As a result, Circe now knows almost everything about the realms. She counsels Gemma for the price of some magic. However, she later betrays Gemma and uses the magic to escape from the well. She tries to take the magic for herself, but she is captured in the Winterlands and sacrificed to the Tree of All Souls. When Gemma faces her choice with the Fates, she gives up her place to Miss Moore, who would otherwise would have to continually wander in the mist.

Other girls at Spence Cecily Temple-a pale, pinch-faced girl who used to be very close to Felicity and Pippa but is now Felicity's rival after Felicity rejects her, and close friends with Elizabeth. Cecily is very conceited and snobbish and thinks very poorly of Gemma and Ann. She is the oldest of the girls at Spence. Elizabeth Poole-a tiny, rat-like girl, who only offers her opinion after everyone else has, who is friends with Cecily. She is also very conservative.

Before she left she stole the dagger that was being protected at Spence. Found dead in the Thames river, she appears in visions and dreams to Gemma. Sahirah Foster - In the second book, Sahirah appears as a teacher named Miss McCleethy, a former alias of Circe, and is suspected of being such by Gemma. She had come to Spence following Circe, Miss Moore. Once she discovered who Gemma was she told Gemma that she was to restore the magic to the order only but Gemma refused to listen to her. In the final book, she takes Gemma's place as Pippa's sacrifice and is killed. Note: There are other members of the order but many are in hiding because of Circe. The Rakshana Amar- Kartik's brother, who is killed in A Great and Terrible Beauty. He also shows up as a warrior and leader of the Winterlands army in The Sweet Far Thing. Hugo Fowlson- Miss McCleethy's lover and 'henchman' for the Rakshana. He helps Gemma in The Sweet Far Thing by going with her into the Realms to destroy the Tree Of All Souls.

Lord Denby- Father of Simon Middleton (who was turned down when he had attempted to court both Felicity and Gemma). He is one of the most powerful members of the Rakshana and attempts to steal the magic from Gemma. =Kartik= (Born in Bombay, November 10, 1878) In A Great and Terrible Beauty, Kartik is initially a member of the Rakshana and is given the task of watching Gemma Doyle and preventing her from entering the Realms. He lives with the Gypsies who camp on Spence's grounds. He also shows an interest in Pippa Cross, but later shows a slight interest in Gemma. They share a kiss, even though Gemma is the one who kisses Kartik as a means of distraction, not because of love. When Pippa dies, he visits Gemma at Pippa's funeral. Having failed his mission, Kartik is called back to London to be reviewed by the Rakshana. In the second novel, Rebel Angels, Kartik is once again given a task by the Rakshana. He must convince Gemma to find the Temple of the Realms, bind the magic in the name of the Eastern Star, which is the Rakshana, and then finally kill her. While Gemma is at her grandmothers house in England, Kartik becomes the driver to the Doyle family, and starts to fall in love with Gemma. Gemma accepts his advances, due to the fact that she finds him captivating, but Kartik is hurt when Gemma says she doesn't think of him as an Indian, and he leaves immediately. Later on, Gemma is kidnapped, and he comes to her rescue, and leaves the brotherhood of the Rakshana. He decides to form an alliance with Gemma and her friends. Kartik's absence at the beginning of The Sweet Far Thing does not go unnoticed by Gemma. His return brings about bad news for Gemma, and he says that he does not wish for their lives to cross again. However, Gemma sees his brother Amar in the realms, which makes him stay, and convinces him to arrange a meeting between them and the Rakshana. Gemma finds out later that he is working for Miss McCleethy and Fowlson, however, Kartik says he is but did not wish to. Gemma is angry about this and will not talk to him for a some time but later forgives him. Kartik and Gemma's affection towards each other grow, and Kartik becomes more and more devoted to Gemma. Kartik accompanies Gemma to the realms, where they join hands in the Caves of Sighs and walk in each other's dreams, where they see each other marry and kiss. This means that Gemma and Kartik's love is true and destined, according to what Gemma learned from Asha. Soon after they leave the caves of Sighs they leave to the Winterlands. In the Winterlands, he is upset at the sight of his brother's corrupted soul and later returns with Gemma to destroy the Tree of All Souls. In an attempt to save Gemma's life after Amar stabs her, Kartik kisses her for the last time to absorb the power of the tree into his own body. He is therefore absorbed into the tree, thus it is as if he is dead. When Gemma returns to the realms for the last time, she discovers that when the wind rustles the tree's branches, she can hear Kartik sigh her name, and the grass feels like his touch to her. His final appearance in the novel is in Gemma's dreams, and is waving to her from the other side of the river (considered the afterlife), waiting for her. Creatures of the Realms = Centaurs and Forest People= Philon-Leader of the Forest People. Philon often gives Gemma the benefit of the doubt. In Rebel Angels, Philon tricks Gemma by giving her a gift of silver arrows, and then says that now she owes the Forest People, and must give them some of her power when she gives it up. In The Sweet Far Thing, Philon turns against Gemma when Cresostus is murdered, but in the final battle, Philon finally sides with Gemma, and helps her win against the Winterlands creatures. It is not clear whether Philon is male or female. In the third novel, Gemma refers to Philon as \\"him\\" when speaking to the Gorgon, but otherwise as \\"it\\" during narrative. Creostus-A Centaur who is skeptical of Gemma and the other girls. He is killed by Neela in The Sweet Far Thing in order to frame the Untouchables.

The Hajin helped guard the Temple for the Order. The Hajin are horrifically scarred, ugly, and looked down upon by others in the Realms, hence their name, The Untouchables. =Gorgon= The Gorgon was bound to a ship by the Order for leading a rebellion.

Mae becomes so entranced by Pippa that, following Pip's death, she refuses to go with Gemma and Bessie and commits herself to eating the berries. Wendy - A young girl blinded by the fire. She has a pet rabbit named Mr. Darcy, who was later sacrifed by Pippa, and lives with Pippa in the Borderlands. Gemma gifts her with the magic to try and restore her sight, but this fails. Bessie is often mean to her, and the other girls are frightened by her because she talks about hearing screaming they can't hear (which comes from the Winterlands). When Gemma and Ann come to make Felicity come back from the Realms, Gemma notices Wendy isn't there. Gemma demands to know what happened to her, to which Pippa tells her that Wendy was 'a burden'. Mercy admits that Pippa brought Wendy to the Winterlands. Because she consumed the berries of the realms, she did not make a substantial sacrifice and was not enslaved by the Tree of Souls. When Gemma returns to the tree after the battle Wendy finds her and shows her a plant she planted that has thick, flat, red leaves. Mercy Paxton - A young girl of about thirteen who also lives with Pippa, Mae, Bessie, and Wendy in the Borderlands.

They are an enemy to the Order and to Gemma. Underneath their cloaks are the souls that they have stolen. Poppy Warriors In Rebel Angels, Gemma, Ann, and Felicity, have an encounter with the \\"Poppy Warriors,\\" in their search for the Temple. The nearly skeletal warriors wear chain mail and tattered knights' tunics painted with poppy flowers, and they make games of stealing and breaking souls from the human world and the realms. Their leader, Azreal, torments Felicity with the knowledge of her father's abuse, attempting to get her to commit suicide. The poppy warriors have the ability to feed on humans' fear, and are able to transform into crows. They live in a dilapidated cathedral in the middle of a lake; the cathedral sits upon multiple bone- filled catacombs. The girls outwit the Poppy Warriors by keeping Felicity, \\"the strength,\\" alive and escape into the lake. =Trackers= They are beastly creatures who have trapped unfortunate souls in their bodies. One is sent by Circe, attempting to kill Gemma. But, to protect her, Virginia and Amar go to it instead. Amar is taken by the monster and to protect herself, Virginia commits suicide.

Upon hearing that Ann is really a wealthy heiress in Rebel Angels, he pursues her until the truth about Ann's situation is revealed. He is recruited by the Rakshana in order to get to Gemma. Materialistic and proper, Tom does not have a good relationship with Gemma in A Great and Terrible Beauty and Rebel Angels, though this changes when he learns more about her in The Sweet Far Thing.

It is native to Eurasia and Africa, but it is also found in North America, where it is an introduced species and uncommon noxious weed. It is a parasitic vine which climbs other plants and takes nutrition directly from them via a haustorium. The dodder resembles a pile of light yellow to orange- red straw wrapped tightly around its host plant. It is mostly stem; the leaves are reduced to scales on the stem's surface, since they are not needed for photosynthesis while the dodder is obtaining nutrients from its host. It bears clusters of tiny yellowish bell-shaped flowers which are only about 3 millimeters wide. The dodder reproduces by seed, with each plant capable of producing over 10,000 seeds at once. This plant is a weed of alfalfa, clover, and tomatoes, as well as other crop plants and native flora. This species is sometimes treated as a subspecies of Cuscuta epithymum.

The five volumes in the My Great Predecessors series are about the players who preceded Kasparov in being official World Champions. The series of books continued with the Modern Chess volumes that covers developments in the 1970s and Kasparov's games with Anatoly Karpov. The series is being extended with three volumes of Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov, covering his other games. The books contain historical details, but for the most part the books are made up of annotated games. Chess journalist Dmitry Plisetsky helped with the books and Kasparov thanks some other chess players in the prefaces of each of the volumes. The books were translated into English by Ken Neat. Each volume has an index of players of the games and an index of chess openings used in the games. They were published in 9.9\\" by 7.2\\" (25 cm by 18 cm) hardback by Everyman Chess starting in 2003, but are now available in electronic format. Many copies of the books contain labels autographed by Kasparov. My Great Predecessors My Great Predecessors, part I My Great Predecessors comprises five volumes: * Part I starts with a chapter about some of the unofficial world champions (before 1886), though much of the commentary focuses on Adolf Anderssen and Paul Morphy. It then covers the first four official world champions: Wilhelm Steinitz, Emanuel Lasker, José Raúl Capablanca, and Alexander Alekhine. * Part II covers the fifth through eighth world champions: Max Euwe, Mikhail Botvinnik, Vasily Smyslov, and Mikhail Tal. Euwe briefly interrupted the reign of Alekhine, while Smyslov's and Tal's respective interruptions to Botvinnik's long reign were similarly brief. * Part III covers the ninth and tenth champions, Tigran Petrosian and Boris Spassky. Petrosian ended Botvinnik's reign in 1963. Spassky challenged Petrosian unsuccessfully in 1966, but defeated him in their 1969 rematch. * Part IV starts by covering some strong Western players who were not world champions: Samuel Reshevsky, Miguel Najdorf, and Bent Larsen. The primary focus of this volume is the eleventh World Champion Bobby Fischer. * Part V covers World Championship contender Victor Korchnoi and the twelfth World Champion Anatoly Karpov. Korchnoi and Karpov played three matches in the World Championship, in 1974, 1978, and 1981. The first match was in the Candidates Tournament to determine who would challenge Fischer in 1975. Fischer refused to defend his title, making the 1974 Karpov versus Korchnoi match a de facto World Championship match. Modern Chess Modern Chess, part One The Modern Chess series covers chess opening developments in the 1970s, all of Kasparov's five World Championship matches with Karpov, and his other games with Karpov. * Part One covers the revolution in chess openings of the 1970s in the wake of Fischer. The book covers new ideas in the Hedgehog system, several lines of the Sicilian Defense, the Grünfeld Defense, the Caro-Kann Defense, the Ruy Lopez, the French Defense, the Nimzo-Indian Defense, and others. Complete games are used to illustrate these opening ideas. The book ends with the opinions of 28 experts. * Part Two covers all of the games between Karpov and Kasparov himself through 1985, including their aborted match in 1984 and their 1985 match in which Kasparov became the thirteenth World Champion. Four early games between the two players are included as well as all 48 games of their first match and all 24 games of their second match. * Part Three covers the 1986 match and the 1987 match between Karpov and Kasparov. It includes all 24 games of the 1986 match, all 24 games of the 1987 match, and three games played between the two matches (two were blitz games). * Part Four includes the 24 games of the 1990 match against Karpov and 42 of their other games through 2009. Garry Kasparov on Garry Kasparov * Part I: 1973–1985 This volume covers 100 games starting from his early days. It ends with a few of the games from his 1984 match with Karpov (the endings only). * Part II: 1985–1993 This volume covers the period of being the FIDE World Champion. It includes 100 games from matches and tournaments. * Part III: 1993–2005 Covers the period after being FIDE World Champion. Reception My Great Predecessors received lavish praise from some reviewers (including Nigel Short), while attracting criticism from others for historical inaccuracies and analysis of games directly copied from unattributed sources. Reviewing My Great Predecessors Part I, chess historian Edward Winter said, \\"The absence of, even, a basic bibliography is shocking in a work which claims to be 'Garry Kasparov's long-awaited definitive history of the World Chess Championship', and a lackadaisical attitude to basic academic standards and historical facts pervades the book.\\"Kasparov and His Predecessors by Edward Winter Edward Winter, Chess Notes, 2003 International Master John L. Watson said that Predecessors \\"must be recommended as an ambitious, interesting work by (I believe) the greatest player in history. It clearly delights and inspires some of its readership regardless of its weaknesses, and is a book that most players will want to own, if only for the story-like narration of events and chess developments.

This is in keeping with the Jewish law which holds that males should be circumcised eight days after birth during a Brit milah ceremony, at which they are also given their name. The circumcision of Christ became a very common subject in Christian art from the 10th century onwards, one of numerous events in the Life of Christ to be frequently depicted by artists. It was initially seen only as a scene in larger cycles, but by the Renaissance might be treated as an individual subject for a painting, or form the main subject in an altarpiece. The event is celebrated as the Feast of the Circumcision in the Eastern Orthodox Church on January 1 in whichever calendar is used, and is also celebrated on the same day by many Anglicans. It is celebrated by Roman Catholics as the Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus, in recent years on January 3 as an Optional Memorial, though it was for long celebrated on January 1, as some other churches still do. A number of relics claiming to be the Holy Prepuce, the foreskin of Jesus, have surfaced. Biblical accounts Workshop of Giovanni Bellini () The Circumcision of Christ by Albrecht Dürer Detail of a Guido Reni painting Mid-18th-century Russian icon The second chapter of the Gospel of Luke records the circumcision of Jesus: However, this account is extremely short, particularly compared to Paul the Apostle's much fuller description of his own circumcision in the third chapter of his Epistle to the Philippians. This led theologians Friedrich Schleiermacher and David Strauss to speculate that the author of the Gospel of Luke might have assumed the circumcision to be historical fact, or might have been relating it as recalled by someone else.\\"The contrast however between the fullness of detail with which this point is elaborated and coloured in the life of the Baptist, and the barrenness with which it is stated in reference to Jesus, is striking, and may justify an agreement with the remark of Schleiermacher, that here, at least, the author of the first chapter is no longer the originator.\\" - Strauss, 217 In addition to the canonical account in the Gospel of Luke, the apocryphal Arabic Infancy Gospel contains the first reference to the survival of Christ's severed foreskin. The second chapter has the following story: \\"And when the time of his circumcision was come, namely, the eighth day, on which the law commanded the child to be circumcised, they circumcised him in a cave. And the old Hebrew woman took the foreskin (others say she took the navel-string), and preserved it in an alabaster-box of old oil of spikenard. And she had a son who was a druggist, to whom she said, \\"Take heed thou sell not this alabaster box of spikenard-ointment, although thou shouldst be offered three hundred pence for it. Now this is that alabaster-box which Mary the sinner procured, and poured forth the ointment out of it upon the head and feet of our Lord Jesus Christ, and wiped it off with the hairs of her head\\".\\"The Lost Books of the Bible,\\" New York: Bell Publishing Company, 1979 Depictions in art The circumcision controversy in early Christianity was resolved in the 1st century, so that non-Jewish Christians were not obliged to be circumcised. Saint Paul, the leading proponent of this position, discouraged circumcision as a qualification for conversion to Christianity. Circumcision soon became rare in most of the Christian world, except the Coptic Church of Egypt (where circumcision was a tradition dating to pre-Christian times) and for Judeo- Christians.Pritz, pp. 108–109. Perhaps for this reason, the subject of the circumcision of Christ was extremely rare in Christian art of the 1st millennium, and there appear to be no surviving examples until the very end of the period, although literary references suggest it was sometimes depicted.Schiller, 89 One of the earliest depictions to survive is a miniature in an important Byzantine illuminated manuscript of 979–984, the Menologion of Basil II in the Vatican Library. This has a scene which shows Mary and Joseph holding the baby Jesus outside a building, probably the Temple of Jerusalem, as a priest comes towards them with a small knife.Schiller, 88–89, and plate 225 This is typical of the early depictions, which avoid showing the operation itself. At the period of Jesus's birth, the actual Jewish practice was for the operation to be performed at home, usually by the father,Schiller, 89; Penny, 116 and Joseph is shown using the knife in an enamelled plaque from the Klosterneuburg Altar (1181) by Nicolas of Verdun, where it is next to plaques showing the very rare scenes (in Christian art) of the circumcisions of Isaac and Samson.Schiller, 89; Schreckenberg, 78–79 Like most later depictions these are shown taking place in a large building, probably representing the Temple, though in fact the ceremony was never performed there. Medieval pilgrims to the Holy Land were told Jesus had been circumcised in the church at Bethlehem. The scene gradually became increasingly common in the art of the Western church, and increasingly rare in Orthodox art. Various themes in theological exegesis of the event influenced the treatment in art. As the first drawing of Christ's blood, it was also seen as a forerunner of, or even the first scene of, the Passion of Christ, and was one of the Seven Sorrows of Mary. Other interpretations developed based on it as the naming ceremony equivalent to Christian baptism, the aspect which was eventually to become most prominent in Catholic thinking. Both in this respect and in terms of finding a place in a pictorial cycle, consideration of the circumcision put it in a kind of competition with the much better established Presentation of Jesus; eventually the two scenes were to be conflated in some paintings.Schiller, 89; Penny, 107, 117–118 An influential book by Leo Steinberg, The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion (1983, 2nd edition 1996), explores the explicit depiction of Christ's penis in art, which he argues became a new focus of attention in late medieval art, initially covered only by a transparent veil in the early 14th century, and by the second half of the century completely uncovered, and often being the subject of the gaze or gestures of other figures in the scene. This emphasis is, among other things, a demonstration of Christ's humanity when it appears in depictions of the Madonna and Child and other scenes of Christ's childhood, and also a foreshadowing of Christ's Passion to come in the context of the Circumcision.Kendrick, 11–15 Having borrowed the large architectural setting in the Temple of the Presentation, later scenes may show the high priest alone holding the baby, as he or a mohel performs the operation, as in the St Wolfgang altarpiece by Michael Pacher (1481), or Dürer's painting (right) and his influential woodcut from his series on the Life of the Virgin. This reflected what had by then become, and remains, standard Jewish practice, where the ceremony is performed in the synagogue and the baby is held by the seated rabbi as the mohel performs the operation. Such an arrangement is seen in a miniature from a German Pentateuch in Hebrew from about 1300, showing the Circumcision of Isaac.Image of Isaac's circumcision, Regensburg c1300, Regensburg Pentateuch, Israel Museum, Jerusalem; Cod. 180/52, fol. 81b. This image is discussed at length by Eva Frojmovic in pp. 228–238 of Framing the Family: Narrative and Representation in the Medieval and Early Modern Periods, Rosalynn Voaden (ed), 2005, Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies. She says she knows of only one other medieval Jewish image of the subject. Other depictions show the baby held by Mary or Joseph, or both. Many show another baby in the background, presumably the next in the queue. Other late medieval and Renaissance depictions of circumcision in general show antipathy towards Judaism; caricatures show the procedure as being grotesquely cruel and the mohel as a threatening figure; Martin Luther's anti-Judaic treatise of 1543, On the Jews and Their Lies, devotes many pages to circumcision.Glick, 91-92; 98–102 Some late-medieval German depictions depict the Circumcision of Christ in a similar vein, with the baby not held by his parents and the officiating Jewish officials given stereotypic features. In at least one manuscript miniature women are shown performing the rite, which has been interpreted as a misogynistic trope, with circumcision represented as a form of emasculation.Schreckenberg illustrates four examples on pp. 143–146, two from manuscripts of c. 1400 (performed by a woman) and c. 1440, and two panels from altarpieces of c. 1450 and 1519. See also Abramson and Hannon, pp. 98, 102–108; Penny, 117. By the 15th century the scene was often prominent in large polyptych altarpieces with many scenes in Northern Europe, and began to be the main scene on the central panel in some cases, usually when commissioned by lay confraternities dedicated to the Holy Name of Jesus, which were found in many cities. These often included donor portraits of members, though none are obvious in Luca Signorelli's Circumcision of Christ commissioned by the confraternity at Volterra. The devotion to the Holy Name was a strong feature of the theatrical and extremely popular preaching of Saint Bernardino of Siena, who adopted Christ's IHS monogram as his personal emblem, which was also used by the Jesuits; this often appears in paintings, as may a scroll held by an angel reading Vocatum est nomen eius Jesum.Penny, 117 A smaller composition in a horizontal format originated with the Venetian painter Giovanni Bellini in about 1500 and was extremely popular, with at least 34 copies or versions being produced over the following decades;Penny, 119; Bartolomeo Veneto's Circoncision' and Bellini's La Circoncision are two of them the nearest to a prime version is in the National Gallery, London, though attributed to his workshop. These appear to have been commissioned for homes, possibly as votive offerings for the safe birth of an eldest son, although the reason for their popularity remains unclear. They followed some other depictions in showing Simeon, the prophet of the Presentation, regarded by then as a High Priest of the Temple, performing the operation on Jesus held by Mary. In other depictions he is a figure in the background, sometimes holding up his hands and looking to heaven, as in the Signorelli.Penny, 118–119 An altarpiece of 1500 by another Venetian painter, Marco Marziale (National Gallery, London), is a thoroughgoing conflation of the Circumcision and Presentation, with the text of Simeon's prophecy, the Nunc dimittis, shown as if in mosaic on the vaults of the temple setting. There were a number of comparable works, some commissioned in circumstances where it is clear that the iconography would have had to pass learned scrutiny, so the conflation was evidently capable of theological approval, although some complaints are also recorded.Penny, 118. The Marziale altarpiece is the subject of Penny's very comprehensive catalogue entry on pp. 104–121; National Gallery page on Marziale Circumcision The scene was often included in Protestant art, where this included narrative scenes. It appears on baptismal fonts because of the connection made by theologians with baptism. A painting (1661, National Gallery of Art, WashingtonRembrandt from NGA Washington) and an etching (1654) by Rembrandt are both unusual in showing the ceremony taking place in a stable.Schiller, 90 By this period large depictions were rarer in Catholic art, not least because the interpretation of the decrees of the final session of the Council of Trent in 1563 discouraged nudity in religious art, even that of the infant Jesus, which made depicting the scene difficult.Blunt, 118, citing Molanus Even before this, 16th-century depictions like those of Bellini, Dürer and Signorelli tended to discreetly hide Jesus's penis from view, in contrast to earlier compositions, where this evidence of his humanity is clearly displayed. Poems on the subject included John Milton's Upon the Circumcision and his contemporary Richard Crashaw's Our Lord in His Circumcision to His Father, which both expounded the traditional symbolism.Milton text, Bartleby.com Theological beliefs and celebrations The circumcision of Jesus has traditionally been seen, as explained in the popular 14th-century work the Golden Legend, as the first time the blood of Christ was shed, and thus the beginning of the process of the redemption of man, and a demonstration that Christ was fully human, and of his obedience to Biblical law.Penny, 116-117 Medieval and Renaissance theologians repeatedly stressed this, also drawing attention to the suffering of Jesus as a demonstration of his humanity and a foreshadowing of his Passion.Glick, 93-96 These themes were continued by Protestant theologians like Jeremy Taylor, who in a treatise of 1657 argued that Jesus's circumcision proved his human nature while fulfilling the law of Moses. Taylor also notes that had Jesus been uncircumcised, it would have made Jews substantially less receptive to his Evangelism.\\"But so mysterious were all the actions of Jesus, that this one [his circumcision] served many ends. For 1. It gave demonstration of the verity of human nature. 2. So he began to fulfill the law. 3. And took from himself the scandal of uncircumcision, which would eternally have prejudiced the Jews against his entertainment and communion. 4. And then he took upon him that name, which declared him to be the Savior of the world; which as it was consummate in the blood of the cross, so it was inaugurated in the blood of circumcision: for \\"when eight days were accomplished for circumcising of the Child, his name was called Jesus.\\" - Taylor, 51 The \\"Feast of the Circumcision of our Lord\\" is a Christian celebration of the circumcision, eight days (according to the Semitic and southern European calculation of intervals of days)In the northern European calculation, which abstracts from the day from which the count begins, the interval was of seven days. after his birth, the occasion on which the child was formally given his name, Jesus, a name derived from Hebrew meaning \\"salvation\\" or \\"saviour\\".: \\"On the eighth day, when it was time to circumcise the child, he was named Jesus, the name the angel had given him before he was conceived.\\" (NIV)Catholic Encyclopedia: Feast of the Circumcision It is first recorded from a church council held at Tours in 567, although it was clearly already long-established. The feast day appears on 1 January in the liturgical calendar of the Eastern Orthodox Church.Greek Orthodox Archdiocese calendar of Holy Days It also appears in the pre-1960 General Roman Calendar and is celebrated by churches of the Anglican Communion (though in many revised Anglican calendars, such as the 1979 calendar of the Episcopal Church, there is a tendency toward associating the day more with the Holy Name of JesusCalendar of the Church Year, according to the Episcopal Church) and virtually all Lutheran churches. Johann Sebastian Bach wrote several cantatas for this Feast, \\"Beschneidung des Herrn\\" (\\"Circumcision of the Lord\\"), including Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied, BWV 190, for 1 January 1724 in Leipzig. It finds no place in the present Roman Calendar of the ordinary form of the Roman Rite, replaced on January 1 by the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God, but is still celebrated by Old Catholics and also by traditionalist Catholics who worship according to the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite (that follows the General Roman Calendar promulgated in 1962). It was for many centuries combined on January 1 with the Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus, before the two were separated, and now that the Feast of the Circumcision has disappeared as such from the official Catholic calendar, the other feast may be regarded as celebrating this too. Relics At various points in history, relics purporting to be the holy prepuce, the foreskin of Christ, have surfaced and various miraculous powers have been ascribed to it. A number of churches in Europe have claimed to possess Jesus' foreskin, sometimes at the same time.Glick, 96, says that \\"there were at least a dozen or so available for veneration\\". The best known was in the Lateran Basilica in Rome, whose authenticity was confirmed by a vision of Saint Bridget of Sweden. In its gold reliquary, it was looted in the Sack of Rome in 1527, but eventually recovered.Glick, 96 Most of the Holy Prepuces were lost or destroyed during the Reformation and the French Revolution.\\"Fore Shame\\", David Farley, Slate.com, Tuesday, Dec. 19, 2006 The Prepuce of Calcata is noteworthy, as the reliquary containing the Holy Foreskin was paraded through the streets of this Italian village as recently as 1983 on the Feast of the Circumcision, which was formerly marked by the Roman Catholic Church around the world on January 1 each year, and is now renamed as the Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus. The practice ended, however, when thieves stole the jewel- encrusted case, contents and all. Following this theft, it is unclear whether any purported Holy Prepuces still exist. Other philosophers contended that with the Ascension of Jesus, all of his body parts – even those no longer attached – ascended as well. One, Leo Allatius, reportedly went so far as to contend that the foreskin became the rings of Saturn.

The surname can also be the result of anglicization of the German cognate Welsch. A popular surname in Scotland. Etymology It appears that the etymology of the name Welsh is derived from the Anglo-Saxon adjective or , an adjective derived from the noun , a term for a Roman or Roman subject. These terms were used by many ancient Germanic peoples to describe inhabitants of the former Roman Empire over the Alps, Rhine, and North Sea, who spoke Latin or Celtic languages. The Old High German walh became walch in Middle High German and the adjectival walhisk became MHG welsch. In present-day German, Welsche refers to Romance peoples, the Italians in particular, but also the French and the Romanic neighbours of the German-speaking lands in general. The Anglo-Saxon variant wilisc of the Proto-Germanic root was applied to the native British peoples encountered by the Saxon invaders and settlers during the 5th and 6th centuries AD. Over the succeeding centuries the term wilisc morphed through Middle English into Welsh, becoming an epithet at once more specifically for the Welsh people, as England became increasingly populated with Anglo-Saxons.

It may apply to both those who display an enthusiasm in Armenian culture and to those who support political or social causes associated with the Armenian people. During and after the First World War and simultaneous Armenian Genocide, the term was applied to people like Henry Morgenthau who actively drew attention to the victims of massacre and deportation, and who raised aid for refugees. President Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt have also been called Armenophiles, due in part to their support for the creation of Wilsonian Armenia. In modern usage, the term is sometimes used (particularly in Turkey and Azerbaijan) as an allegation of bias, especially when applied to those who actively support recognition of the Armenian Genocide or those who support the Armenian position in the Nagorno- Karabakh conflict and the recognition of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.

During the Hamidian massacres and the Armenian Genocide he was the leading Armenophile in Britain. His October 6, 1915 speech at the parliament about the genocide was included in Arnold J.

At that time, the general Tang Xiujing, who was then the commandant at Xi Prefecture (西州, roughly modern Turfan Prefecture, Xinjiang), was requested that an army be launched to recover four garrisons that had fallen to Tibet in 670 -- Qiuzi, Yutian, Shule, and Suiye. Because Wang had lived in Tibet for some time, he was considered knowledgeable about Tibet, and Wu Zetian commissioned him to command the army against Tibet, assisted by the general Ashina Zhongjie (). In winter 692, Wang defeated Tibetan forces and recaptured the four garrisons. In 694, Wang again achieved victories near Qinghai Lake against Tibetan general Gar Tsenyen Gungton (\\"Bolun Zanren\\" () in Chinese) and Western Turks' Shixing Khan Ashina Tuizi (). He was soon made the minister of defense (夏官尚書, Xiaguan Shangshu) and given the designation Tong Fengge Luantai Sanpin (). While serving as chancellor, he was also then commissioned to command an army against Eastern Turks, formally under the command of Wu Zetian's lover Huaiyi, but did not appear to actually engage the Eastern Turks' forces. He was again commissioned to attack Eastern Turks' in 695, but when Tibet attacked later that year, he was commissioned to attack Tibet instead. In 696, when he and fellow chancellor Lou Shide engaged Tibetan forces, however, they were defeated by Gar Trinring Tsendro and Trinring's brother Gar Tsenba (\\"Lun Zanpo\\" () in Chinese). Lou was demoted, while Wang was reduced to commoner rank. Map of the Khitan Rebellion during which Wang Xiaojie was defeated Later that year, however, there was a major Khitan rebellion under Li Jinzhong, who died later that year and was succeeded by his brother-in-law Sun Wanrong. In 697, with Khitan forces penetrating deep into Zhou territory, Wu Zetian commissioned Wang to be the acting commander of an army against Khitan, assisted by Su Honghui (), commanding some 170,000 men. In spring 697, Wang engaged Sun at Dongxia Rocky Valley (東硤石谷, near modern Tangshan, Hebei). Wang himself commanded the forward troops and had initial successes, but as he fought near a cliff, Khitan forces counterattacked, and Su Honghui fled. Wang fell off the cliff and died, and the army suffered heavy losses. Wang's secretary Zhang Shuo reported back to Wu Zetian in Luoyang (now capital) and stated, \\"Wang Xiaojie was brave and willing to fight to the death. He faithfully served the empire, fought into enemy territory, and fought many with few. But he had no backup, and so he was defeated.\\" Wu Zetian posthumously honored Wang as the minister of defense and created him the Duke of Geng. She also ordered that Su Honghui be put to death, although before her emissaries arrived, Su had won other battles, and was spared the death penalty. Wang's son Wang Wuze () later served as a general during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong.

(An inviscid fluid is a theoretical fluid having zero viscosity.) The primary flow of a fluid, particularly in the majority of the flow field remote from solid surfaces immersed in the fluid, is usually very similar to what would be predicted using the basic principles of physics, and assuming the fluid is inviscid. However, in real flow situations, there are regions in the flow field where the flow is significantly different in both speed and direction to what is predicted for an inviscid fluid using simple analytical techniques. The flow in these regions is the secondary flow. These regions are usually in the vicinity of the boundary of the fluid adjacent to solid surfaces where viscous forces are at work, such as in the boundary layer. In engineering secondary flow also identifies an additional flow path.  Examples of secondary flows  = Wind near ground level = The basic principles of physics and the Coriolis effect satisfactorily explain that the direction of the wind in the atmosphere is parallel to the isobars. Measurements of wind speed and direction at heights well above ground level confirm that the speed of the wind matches that predicted by considerations of gradient flow, and the direction of the wind is indeed parallel to the isobars in the region. However, from ground level up to heights where the influence of the earth's surface can be neglected, the wind speed is less than predicted by the barometric pressure gradient, and the wind direction is partly across the isobars rather than parallel to them. This flow of air across the isobars near ground level is a secondary flow. It does not conform to the primary flow, which is parallel to the isobars. At heights well above ground level there is a balance between the Coriolis effect, the local pressure gradient, and the velocity of the wind. This is balanced flow. Closer to the ground the air is not able to accelerate to the speed necessary for balanced flow. Interference by the surface of the ground or water, and by obstructions such as terrain, waves, trees and buildings, cause drag on the atmosphere and prevent the air from accelerating to the speed necessary to achieve balanced flow. As a result, the wind direction near ground level is partly parallel to the isobars in the region, and partly across the isobars in the direction from higher pressure to lower pressure. As a result of the slower wind speed at the earth's surface, in a region of low pressure the barometric pressure is usually significantly higher at the surface than would be expected, given the barometric pressure at mid altitudes, due to Bernoulli's principle. Hence, the secondary flow toward the center of a region of low pressure is also drawn upward by the significantly lower pressure at mid altitudes. This slow, widespread ascent of the air in a region of low pressure can cause widespread cloud and rain if the air is of sufficiently high relative humidity. In a region of high pressure (an anticyclone) the secondary flow includes a slow, widespread descent of air from mid altitudes toward ground level, and then outward across the isobars. This descent causes a reduction in relative humidity and explains why regions of high pressure usually experience cloud- free skies for many days.  Tropical cyclones  The primary flow around a tropical cyclone is parallel to the isobars – and hence circular. The closer to the center of the cyclone, the faster is the wind speed. In accordance with Bernoulli's principle where the wind speed is fastest the barometric pressure is lowest. Consequently, near the center of the cyclone the barometric pressure is very low. There is a strong pressure gradient across the isobars toward the center of the cyclone. This pressure gradient provides the centripetal force necessary for the circular motion of each parcel of air. This strong gradient, coupled with the slower speed of the air near the Earth's surface, causes a secondary flow at surface level toward the center of the cyclone, rather than a wholly circular flow. Even though the wind speed near the center of a tropical cyclone is very fast, at any point on the Earth's surface it is not as fast as it is above that point away from the retarding influence of the Earth's surface. The slower speed of the air at the earth's surface prevents the barometric pressure from falling as low as would be expected from the barometric pressure at mid altitudes. This is compatible with Bernoulli's principle. The secondary flow at the Earth's surface is toward the center of the cyclone but is then drawn upward by the significantly lower pressure at mid and high altitudes. As the secondary flow is drawn upward the air cools and its pressure falls, causing extremely heavy rainfall over several days. = Tornadoes and dust devils = An example of a dust devil in Ramadi, Iraq. Tornadoes and dust devils display localised vortex flow. Their fluid motion is similar to tropical cyclones but on a much smaller scale so that the Coriolis effect is not significant. The primary flow is circular around the vertical axis of the tornado or dust devil. As with all vortex flow, the speed of the flow is fastest at the core of the vortex. In accordance with Bernoulli's principle where the wind speed is fastest the air pressure is lowest; and where the wind speed is slowest the air pressure is highest. Consequently, near the center of the tornado or dust devil the air pressure is low. There is a pressure gradient toward the center of the vortex. This gradient, coupled with the slower speed of the air near the earth's surface, causes a secondary flow toward the center of the tornado or dust devil, rather than in a purely circular pattern. The slower speed of the air at the surface prevents the air pressure from falling as low as would normally be expected from the air pressure at greater heights. This is compatible with Bernoulli's principle. The secondary flow is toward the center of the tornado or dust devil, and is then drawn upward by the significantly lower pressure several thousands of feet above the surface in the case of a tornado, or several hundred feet in the case of a dust devil. Tornadoes can be very destructive and the secondary flow can cause debris to be swept into a central location and carried to low altitudes. Dust devils can be seen by the dust stirred up at ground level, swept up by the secondary flow and concentrated in a central location. The accumulation of dust then accompanies the secondary flow upward into the region of intense low pressure that exists outside the influence of the ground. = Circular flow in a bowl or cup = When water in a circular bowl or cup is moving in circular motion the water displays free- vortex flow – the water at the center of the bowl or cup spins at relatively high speed, and the water at the perimeter spins more slowly. The water is a little deeper at the perimeter and a little more shallow at the center, and the surface of the water is not flat but displays the characteristic depression toward the axis of the spinning fluid. At any elevation within the water the pressure is a little greater near the perimeter of the bowl or cup where the water is a little deeper, than near the center. The water pressure is a little greater where the water speed is a little slower, and the pressure is a little less where the speed is faster, and this is consistent with Bernoulli's principle. There is a pressure gradient from the perimeter of the bowl or cup toward the center. This pressure gradient provides the centripetal force necessary for the circular motion of each parcel of water. The pressure gradient also accounts for a secondary flow of the boundary layer in the water flowing across the floor of the bowl or cup. The slower speed of the water in the boundary layer is unable to balance the pressure gradient. The boundary layer spirals inward toward the axis of circulation of the water. On reaching the center the secondary flow is then upward toward the surface, progressively mixing with the primary flow. Near the surface there may also be a slow secondary flow outward toward the perimeter. The secondary flow along the floor of the bowl or cup can be seen by sprinkling heavy particles such as sugar, sand, rice or tea leaves into the water and then setting the water in circular motion by stirring with a hand or spoon. The boundary layer spirals inward and sweeps the heavier solids into a neat pile in the center of the bowl or cup. With water circulating in a bowl or cup, the primary flow is purely circular and might be expected to fling heavy particles outward to the perimeter. Instead, heavy particles can be seen to congregate in the center as a result of the secondary flow along the floor. = River bends = thumb Water flowing through a bend in a river must follow curved streamlines to remain within the banks of the river. The water surface is slightly higher near the concave bank than near the convex bank. (The \\"concave bank\\" has the greater radius. The \\"convex bank\\" has the smaller radius.) As a result, at any elevation within the river, water pressure is slightly higher near the concave bank than near the convex bank. A pressure gradient results from the concave bank toward the other bank. Centripetal forces are necessary for the curved path of each parcel of water, which is provided by the pressure gradient. The primary flow around the bend is vortex flow – fastest speed where the radius of curvature of the stream itself is smallest and slowest speed where the radius is largest.In the absence of secondary flow, bend flow seeks to conserve angular momentum so that it tends to conform to that of a free vortex with high velocity at the smaller radius of the inner bank and lower velocity at the outer bank where radial acceleration is lower. The higher pressure near the concave (outer) bank is accompanied by slower water speed, and the lower pressure near the convex bank is accompanied by faster water speed, and all this is consistent with Bernoulli's principle. A secondary flow results in the boundary layer along the floor of the river bed. The boundary layer is not moving fast enough to balance the pressure gradient and so its path is partly downstream and partly across the stream from the concave bank toward the convex bank, driven by the pressure gradient.Near the bed, where velocity and thus the centrifugal effects are lowest, the balance of forces is dominated by the inward hydraulic gradient of the super-elevated water surface and secondary flow moves toward the inner bank. The secondary flow is then upward toward the surface where it mixes with the primary flow or moves slowly across the surface, back toward the concave bank.Journal of Geophysical Research, Volume 107 (2002) This motion is called helicoidal flow. On the floor of the river bed the secondary flow sweeps sand, silt and gravel across the river and deposits the solids near the convex bank, in similar fashion to sugar or tea leaves being swept toward the center of a bowl or cup as described above. This process can lead to accentuation or creation of D-shaped islands, meanders through creation of cut banks and opposing point bars which in turn may result in an oxbow lake. The convex (inner) bank of river bends tends to be shallow and made up of sand, silt and fine gravel; the concave (outer) bank tends to be steep and elevated due to heavy erosion. = Turbomachinery = Different definitions have been put forward for secondary flow in turbomachinery, such as \\"Secondary flow in broad terms means flow at right angles to intended primary flow\\".Compressor Aerodynamics, N.A. Cumpsty, , p.316 Secondary flows occur in the main, or primary, flowpath in turbomachinery compressors and turbines (see also unrelated use of term for flow in the secondary air system of a gas turbine engine). They are always present when a wall boundary layer is turned through an angle by a curved surface.Gas Turbine Theory, Cohen, Rogers and Saravanamutoo 1972, 2nd edition, , p.205 They are a source of total pressure loss and limit the efficiency that can be achieved for the compressor or turbine. Modelling the flow enables blade, vane and end-wall surfaces to be shaped to reduce the losses.Formation of Secondary Flows in Turbines Secondary Flow Research at the University of Durham Secondary flows occur throughout the impeller in a centrifugal compressor but are less marked in axial compressors due to shorter passage lengths.http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/arc/cp/1363.pdf, p.8 Flow turning is low in axial compressors but boundary layers are thick on the annulus walls which gives significant secondary flows.Dixon, S.L. (1978), Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics of Turbomachinery pp 181–184, Fourth edition, Pergamon Press Ltd, UK Flow turning in turbine blading and vanes is high and generates strong secondary flow.https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a028337.pdf 5-22 Secondary flows also occur in pumps for liquids and include inlet prerotation, or intake vorticity, tip clearance flow (tip leakage), flow separation when operating away from the design condition, and secondary vorticity. The following, from Dixon,Dixon, S.L. (1978), Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics of Turbomachinery pp 194, Fourth edition, Pergamon Press Ltd, UK shows the secondary flow generated by flow turning in an axial compressor blade or stator passage. Consider flow with an approach velocity c1. The velocity profile will be non- uniform due to friction between the annulus wall and the fluid. The vorticity of this boundary layer is normal to the approach velocity c_{1} and of magnitude : w_1=\\\\frac{dc_1}{dz} ,where z is the distance to the wall. As the vorticity of each blade onto each other will be of opposite directions, a secondary vorticity will be generated. If the deflection angle, e, between the guide vanes is small, the magnitude of the secondary vorticity is represented as : w_s=-2e \\\\left(\\\\frac{dc_1}{dz}\\\\right) This secondary flow will be the integrated effect of the distribution of secondary vorticity along the blade length. =Gas turbine engines= Gas turbine engines have a power-producing primary airflow passing through the compressor. They also have a substantial (25% of core flow in a Pratt & Whitney PW2000)Heat Management in Advanced Aircraft Gas Turbine Engines, Brines and Gray, United technologies Corporation, The American Society Of Mechanical Engineers, Paper 86-GT-76, p.3 secondary flow obtained from the primary flow and which is pumped from the compressor and used by the secondary air system. Like the secondary flow in turbomachinery this secondary flow is also a loss to the power-producing capability of the engine. =Air-breathing propulsion systems= Thrust- producing flow which passes through an engines thermal cycle is called primary airflow. Using only cycle flow was relatively short-lived as the turbojet engine. Airflow through a propeller or a turbomachine fan is called secondary flow and is not part of the thermal cycle.The Aerothermodynamics Of Aircraft Gas Turbine Engines, Gordon C. Oates, editor, AFAPL-TR-78-52, Air Force Aero Propulsion Laboratory, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio 45433, 1.2.3.3.1 This use of secondary flow reduces losses and increases the overall efficiency of the propulsion system. The secondary flow may be many times that through the engine. =Supersonic air-breathing propulsion systems= During the 1960s cruising at speeds between Mach 2 to 3 was pursued for commercial and military aircraft. Concorde, North American XB-70 and Lockheed SR-71 used ejector-type supersonic nozzles which had a secondary flow obtained from the inlet upstream of the engine compressor. The secondary flow was used to purge the engine compartment, cool the engine case, cool the ejector nozzle and cushion the primary expansion. The secondary flow was ejected by the pumping action of the primary gas flow through the engine nozzle and the ram pressure in the inlet.  See also    Notes   References  * Dixon, S.L.

Most likely released in 1929, it is notable for being the earliest known American pornographic film to depict exclusively homosexual intercourse.Burger, John R.

Hard Core: Power, Pleasure, and the \\"Frenzy of the Visible.\\" Expanded ed. Berkeley, Calif.: University of California Press, 1999. Hardcore pornographic films (later called \\"stag films\\") first appeared in Europe in 1908. By 1920, the first hardcore homosexual sex acts were depicted in the film Le ménage moderne du Madame Butterfly.Waugh, Thomas. Hard To Imagine. New York: Columbia University Press, 1996. Slade, Joseph. \\"Bernard Natan: France's Legendary Pornographer.\\" Journal of Film and Video. 45:2-3 (Summer-Fall 1993). However, like most of the films which came after it, Le ménage moderne du Madame Butterfly only shows male-male sex acts as deviant, firmly establishes the heterosexuality of the characters, and usually depicts gay sex acts as essentially bisexual (e.g., male-male sexual contact occurs while the men are also having heterosexual intercourse). Most historians consider the first genuine American stag film to be A Free Ride, produced and released in 1915.Knight, Arthur, and Alpert, Hollis. \\"The Stag Film.\\" Playboy. November 1967.Di Lauro, Al and Rabkin, Gerald. Dirty Movies: An Illustrated History of the Stag Film, 1915-1970. New York: Value Proprietary, 1988. The illegality of hardcore pornographic films in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s means that no producer, performer or other credits for The Surprise of a Knight are identifiable. However, researchers have dated the film to at least 1929Waugh, Thomas. \\"Homosociality in the Classical American Stag Film: Off-Screen, On-Screen.\\" Porn Studies. Linda Williams, ed. Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2004. (although earlier estimates placed its production in 1930). This makes The Surprise of a Knight the first known hardcore gay pornographic film in American cinematic history. Plot The film opens with an elegantly attired \\"woman\\" with short hair as she finishes dressing for a visitor. As the \\"lady\\" completes her boudoir, she lifts her skirts to reveal a thick patch of pubic hair. At this point, an intertitle reveals that the screenwriter is \\"Oscar Wild\\" (clearly a pseudonym). The \\"lady\\" goes into the drawing room and offers her well-attired gentleman caller (her \\"knight\\") a drink. He refuses it, and she drinks the cocktail. They talk briefly, and then engage in passionate kissing. Whenever the gentleman caller puts his hands on the \\"lady's\\" breasts or genitals, \\"she\\" pushes his hand away. Finally, she slaps him coyly. The \\"lady\\" then apologizes for her aggressiveness by fellating her partner. The \\"lady\\" then lies face-down on the sofa with her buttocks in the air. It is revealed that she has no underwear on. The gentleman caller then copulates the \\"lady\\" anally (although no penetration is actually shown). After a minute or so, the gentleman withdraws and sits back on the sofa. The \\"lady\\" gyrates her buttocks in the air. This induces him to mount her anally again. Both individuals reach orgasm, and the gentleman caller walks off-camera. The \\"lady\\" stands and raises her skirts to reveal that \\"she\\" is really a he. The film's second and final intertitle announces \\"Surprise.\\" His penis is exposed. The man in drag then dances about briefly, making sure that his penis bobs up and down in the air. The gentleman caller re-enters the camera's view, and helps the other man remove his skirt and most of his other clothing. The gentleman caller (now completely clothed again) dances briefly with the nude young man. After a jump cut, the \\"lady\\"—now dressed completely in business attire—walks back on screen, winks at the audience, and walks off screen. Assessment The Surprise of a Knight ushered in a brief period of homosexual hardcore pornography in the stag film era. About a year later, in A Stiff Game, an African American male would engage in fellatio on a Caucasian man without the need for drag. The appearance of gay sexual contact on film would soon end, however, and not reappear until the advent of legal gay hardcore pornography after 1970. Thomas Waugh and Linda Williams have argued The Surprise of a Knight is a film fraught with interpretational difficulties. Williams notes the lead character (the \\"lady\\") is in costume, yet costumes are the antithesis of the hardcore pornographic film (in which nudity and the display of genitalia and penetration during intercourse are key). \\"The costume spectacle either steals the show...\\" as film historian Thomas Waugh put it, \\"...or becomes a grotesque distraction...\\"Waugh, Hard To Imagine, 1996, p. 314. The revelation of the \\"lady's\\" penis is not real surprise, Waugh concludes, as audiences knew what sort of film they were getting (e.g., homosexual porn). The use of drag in The Surprise of a Knight also distances the audience from the performers on screen, Waugh argues. The main character of the film is a drag queen, and yet nearly all the audience members could say they were not drag queens. Waugh see the film not depicting gay men on screen, but reaffirming heteronormativity and negative stereotypes of gay men and gay sex. John Robert Burger writes it is unclear from the film whether the visitor knows of the drag queen's gender before the encounter, and hiding the gender of the drag queen makes it \\"faux homosexuality\\". Burger also writes,The Surprise of a Knight is an exception to the norm of stag films, in which the receptive partner in same-sex anal sex is typically perceived to be victimized or punished.

Muaro Jambi () is a Buddhist temple complex, in Muaro Jambi Regency, Jambi province, Sumatra, Indonesia. It is situated 26 kilometers east from the city of Jambi. The temple complex was built by the Melayu Kingdom, with its surviving temples and other archaeological remains estimated to date from the 7th to 13th century CE. The archaeological site includes eight excavated temple sanctuaries and covers about 12 square kilometers, stretches 7.5 kilometers along the Batang Hari River, 80 menapos or mounds of temple ruins, are not yet restored. It is one of the largest and best-preserved ancient temple complexes in South East Asia. It was suggested that Muaro Jambi Temple compound might be the initial location of Srivijaya kingdom. This is mainly because, Muaro Jambi has far richer temple concentration—in contrast to the scarcity of archaeological sites in South Sumatra. History The start of the rise of the kingdom of Melayu can be dated to 1025 when India's Chola kingdom attacked and destroyed the capital of the Sumatran maritime empire of Srivijaya. This allowed a number of smaller Sumatran polities to expand their political and economic influence. During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries it seems that from its river estuarine basis along the Batang Hari, Melayu became the dominant economic power in Sumatra. The substantial archaeological remains at Muaro Jambi suggest that this may have been the site of the Melayu capital. The city's age of glory came to an end in 1278 when Java's Singhasari kingdom attacked the city, even succeeding in capturing members of the royal family. The site was rediscovered by Dutch explorers in the nineteenth century. It is now protected as a national monument. Design and decoration Candi Tinggi, one of the temple within Muaro Jambi temple compound. The temple complex of Candi Muaro Jambi is spread out over a large area along the banks of the Batang Hari River. Eight temple complexes have been excavated but many more mounds and sites remain to be explored within the conservation area, much of which is still covered by thick jungle. The three most significant intact temples are known as Candi Tinggi, Candi Kedaton and Candi Gumpung. The temples are built from red brick and unlike the temples of Java, feature very little ornamentation, carving or statuary. A few pieces of sculpture are housed in a small, on-site museum. The wooden dwellings that are believed to have housed the city's population have all disappeared without a trace. Only 7 temples have been restored, 3 have mentioned above and the others are Candi Tinggi I, Candi Kembarbatu, Candi Gedong I and Candi Gedong II.

He is alternately referred to as either a cleric or wizard who regularly beats the Devil in bets and games. He is most well known around Herefordshire and Monmouthshire, and his legends are used to tell the origin of many of the geological formations around the region. History Jack o' Kent appears in print for the first time in a sixteenth-century play, so it may be assumed that he was well known in local culture before this time. He is said to have been used as a bogeyman figure until at least the early twentieth century. There is speculation that Jack could be Siôn Cent, but it is more likely that he was an amalgamation of a number of people and myths. Legends Jack often outsmarted the Devil by entering into bargains and then fulfilling the letter of the bargain but not the spirit. In one instance he made a deal with the Devil so that his crops would prosper - Jack would plant the crops, and the devil would make sure that the sun and rain came in proper amounts. Jack asked the Devil which part of the crops he wanted, the \\"tops\\" or the \\"butts\\" (bottoms), and the Devil picked \\"tops\\" thinking that come harvest he would receive a lot of wheat, but Jack planted turnips and left the Devil with the useless leaves. The next year the Devil thought he'd get the better of Jack and picked \\"butts\\", so Jack planted wheat, and once again the Devil was cheated. In another story, Jack asks the Devil to help him build a bridge, promising him the first soul that crosses it. They build the bridge and then Jack tosses a bone over the bridge and a hungry dog runs across. =Geographical interpretations= Jack o' Kent legends are used to explain a number of geographical formations in the Welsh border region. * Jack is said to have bet the Devil that the Sugar Loaf Mountain was higher than the Malvern Hills. When Jack proved the Devil wrong, the Devil tried to put more soil on top of the Malvern Hills, but his carrier broke and dropped at the end of the island forming a lump. * The cleft in the western part of Skirrid is said to have been caused by Jack's heel as he jumped onto it from the Sugar Loaf Mountain. * The standing stones at Trelleck are said to have been thrown there by Jack, the result of a stone-throwing competition held on Trelleck Beacon between him and the Devil. Another version has Jack flinging the stones from Skirrid.Hando, F., (1944), The Pleasant Land of Gwent, Newport: R. H.

It is one of two stations that were added to the line when it was upgraded prior to being reopened as the Johnsonville Branch. It is one of four stations on the line located on a curve; before arrival at the Crofton Downs or Awarua Street stations, the onboard announcement adds Please mind the gap when exiting the train. Electric multiple unit trains are operated under the Metlink brand through this station in both directions to Johnsonville (to the north) and Wellington (to the south).  History  As part of the upgrade of the section of the old Wellington and Manawatu Railway between Wellington and Johnsonville, two new stations were constructed, Awarua Street and Simla Crescent. The newly electrified Johnsonville Branch officially opened on 2 July 1938, with services to all stations from Monday 4 July. The two new stations had been used by some steam trains from 10 January 1938. Awarua Street Station is entirely overhauled during maintenance to extend the platform to six carriage length, as seen from the northern end of the station Over the summer of 2008/09, the platform of the station was entirely demolished to be replaced by a brand new platform that could accommodate six carriages, as opposed to four. The replaced platform is twice the length of the old platform.  Services  Trains run in both directions through this station, departing at half-hourly intervals, supplemented by a 13/13/26 schedule at peak times on week days. The closest bus route is #26, which passes by the end of Awarua Street along Ottawa Road. Pedestrian access from Awarua Street  Facilities  The station has a single side platform and passenger shelter. Pedestrian access to the station is via a walkway from Awarua Street near the rail bridge over Awarua Street, or from a long flight of steps down from Fox Street to the north end of the platform. There is no dedicated station car park available.

Description  Juveniles may be variously patterned Cancer productus has carapace teeth that are somewhat broad and rounded with teeth between the eyes of nearly equal size and shape. The carapace of C. productus is widest at the posterior- most tooth, up to 20.0 cm wide. The pincers are large with distinctive black tips. This species lacks serrations or projections on the ventral side of the claws. Adults have a brick-red coloration throughout. The coloration of juveniles is diverse, often white, sometimes with red spots, or zebra-striped.  Similar species  Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister) has serrations on the dorsal side of the chelipeds and lacks black tips. The graceful rock crab (Metacarcinus gracilis) has a single projection on the dorsal side of the chelipeds and also lacks black tips, and the widest point of carapace is at the second posterior-most tooth. The pygmy rock crab (Glebocarcinus oregonensis) has black-tipped chelipeds, but has large tubercles on the dorsum. Glebocarcinus oregonensis is also much smaller, such that a C. productus of similar size would generally have a striking juvenile coloration. Cancer pagurus is very similar, but distinguished by its non-overlapping range.  Range and habitat  Closeup of a red rock crab Cancer productus ranges from Kodiak Island, Alaska to Isla San Martine, Baja California. It inhabits mid-intertidal waters to 79 m depth.  Biology  Cancer productus is carnivorous; in Puget Sound it will crush barnacles with its large pincers for consumption. Small living crabs and dead fish are also eaten. Mating in this species occurs when the female is soft-shelled from October to June in Puget Sound. The male can often been seen guarding females until molting during this time. This species is known to be a favorite prey item of the giant Pacific octopus, Enteroctopus dofleini. Fishery Cancer productus is harvested by sport and commercial fishermen in California, mostly from Morro Bay south. The California rock crab fishery is made up of three species - the yellow rock crab (C. anthonyi), the brown rock crab (R. antennarium), and the red rock crab (C. productus). Rock crab landings for 1999 were 790,000 pounds and have averaged 1.2 million pounds per year from 1991-1999. It is not as sought after as Dungeness crab due to the considerably lower amount of flesh. However, the flesh has a delicate flavor and slightly sweet taste. The similar Cancer pagurus has a major commercial fishery in western Europe. Both males and females with a carapace exceeding may be harvested in Washington, when in season.

Political career He was a successful businessman before becoming a politician with the United National Party. He was one of the first minority Tamil politician to join a majority Sinhalese dominated political party from the south after the commencement of the Sri Lankan civil war. During the UNP rule he was known for not following party regulations regarding voting for emergency regulations. He always voted to rescind it. He was also known for his efforts to high light the Human rights situation affecting the minority Sri Lankan Tamils both in the parliament and to the local media. Generally he had voiced support for the war effort against the LTTE but had highlighted the civilian repercussions. Just before his death, he had accused the rival Eelam People's Democratic Party as being behind the rash of murders targeting civilians in the Jaffna peninsula. Just before his death, his security staff was reduced from 11 to 2 by the government after the budget speech. He was accused by D. B. S. Jeyaraj of being a Hindu chauvinist and eroding \\"Tamil religious unity\\" by supporting the anti-Conversion bill espoused by Sinhalese Buddhist politiciansMaheswaran threatens Tamil religious unity Sunday Leader - 18 January 2004 during his term as Hindu affairs minister.SRI LANKA: Buddhists, Hindus Join to Keep New Churches at Bay Inter Press Service - 31 October 2003  Assassination  He was shot dead by unknown gunman while attending the New Year prayers at Kotahena, Sivan Kovil around 10:35 local time (05:05 GMT) and later succumbed to his injuries at the Colombo General Hospital along with one Hindu pilgrim who was too attending to the prayers.

To the accusation that Douglas Devananda a cabinet minister and leader of the EPDP political party was involved in his murder and had previously threatened T. Maheswaran, Douglas had denied any responsibility. According to the spokesperson of Sri Lankan Ministry of Defence, the gunman was wounded when Maheswaran's bodyguard returned fire and had been arrested and hospitalized. He is the third prominent minority Tamil parliamentarian to be killed.

He was an original member of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati. He died in 1801 in Newton, Massachusetts. Family His five brothers and five sons, including Michael Jackson, Jr., also all served in the war. The family granted some farm lands in its possession to Harvard University to help found the institution. After the Revolutionary War, some members of the famous, mostly doctors, Jackson family moved to Madison, WI, where they helped establish city institutions including Methodist Hospital and the Jackson Clinics, now Meriter Hospital and two of them married into the Hobbins family, which like them included doctors and surgeons, bank founders, and well known business leaders. Madison's Dr. Will Hobbins served in the infamous Wisconsin Eagle Brigade as asst Doctor Surgeon, with Brother in Law Surgeon James A. Jackson and Quartermaster Colonel James Mears. Will's older brother Dr. Joseph Hobbins served at Camp Randall as Union Chief Doctor Surgeon in charge at Camp Randall, and at the end of the war, treating 1400 Confederate soldiers captured on the Mississippi at Island 11 at Camp Randall at the end of American Civil War. These men sought to establish the University of Wisconsin's first medical college (a 1st effort that failed), founded the Wisconsin Horticulture Society and Madison Literary Club, President and Doctor Surgeons founding Wisconsin's St George's Society under charter approved by the Wisconsin Legislature. Other Hobbins' offspring founded many of the state capital's first banks, such as the American Exchange Bank (1st German Bank (Fred Suhr) merger) with many preserved historic family homes on Mansion Hill. James R Hobbins, son of Mary and Joseph W. Hobbins would travel to Butte, MT with his nephew John Suhr Hobbins who would marry a local girl, Margaret Perham, and return to Madison as 1st Cashier at the American Exchange Bank, later to become Vice President with older brother Wm Suhr Hobbins as President.

Career  Upon graduation, he went to work for the U.S. Forest Service, where his career spanned 43 years as a forest researcher. Zon was a protégé' of both Dr. Bernhard Fernow and Gifford Pinchot, first Chief of the United States Forest Service, and a close friend of Bob Marshall in the 1930s. Zon made significant contributions to forestry literature. Many of his more than 200 scientific publications have been translated into Russian, French, German, and Japanese. With Bernard Fernow, Zon helped establish American forestry’s professional periodical literature. These contributions began when he joined the editorial staff of Forest Quarterly. He deepened his involvement, becoming editor of the Proceedings of the Society of American Foresters in 1905. When Forest Quarterly and Proceedings merged, Zon became one of the founders and the first managing editor of the combined publication, the Journal of Forestry.

Biography Gallus in 59 BC, had accused Quintus Fabius Maximus and Gaius Antonius Hybrida of the Lex Acilia repetundarum, whom Cicero defended the accused. After 58 BC Gallus married Antonia Hybrida Major, the first daughter of Gaius Antonius Hybrida and a paternal cousin to triumvir Mark Antony.Antonia, wife of Gallus In 56 BC, while tribune of the Roman citizens, Gallus tried to increase the power and influence of Pompey. He prevented Publius Cornelius Lentulus Spinther from becoming proconsul of Cilicia. Gallus assisted the Greek Ptolemaic Pharaoh Ptolemy XII Auletes of Egypt to reclaim his throne. He forwarded a suggestion that Pompey, accompanied only by two lictors accompany Ptolemy back to Alexandria for Ptolemy to create a reconciliation with the citizens of Egypt. This was about to happen, but never occurred. In 55 BC, Gallus was accused, probably by Marcus Colonius, for an unknown transgression. At the request of Pompey, Cicero defended him. Gallus travelled to Greece in 51 BC and became a praetor in Achaea, then travelled to Athens, to visit Cicero. During the civil war between Caesar and Pompey, Gallus remained neutral. Gallus had a son of the same name, who served as a consul with Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa in 37 BC and a grandson of the same name that served as a suffect consul in 2 BC, along with Marcus Plautius Silvanus.

Babelsberg and Glienicke Palace can be seen nearby. The castle is part of the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin UNESCO World Heritage Site. History The construction of a small lodge was begun in 1682-84 under the \\"Great Elector\\" Frederick William of Brandenburg, together with a cavalier house and stables, possibly according to plans designed by Charles Philippe Dieussart. The castle grounds were completed in 1693 during the reign of his successor Frederick III. When Elector Frederick rose to a King in Prussia in 1701, he had the castle lavishly rebuilt in a Baroque style. King Frederick William I of Prussia used it as a military hospital. In 1763, King Frederick the Great gave it as a present to Isaac Levin Joel, a wallpaper and carpet maker who used it for wallpaper manufacture. From 1827, it was owned by the civil servant and pedagogue Wilhelm von Türk, who turned it into an orphanage in 1832. In 1859, the lodge was acquired by Prince Charles of Prussia, who hired the court architect Ferdinand von Arnim to renovate the castle in Neo-baroque style for his son Prince Frederick Charles. He also had an English landscape garden laid out, probably assisted by Peter Joseph Lenne. In 1889-92, Frederick Charles' son and heir Prince Friedrich Leopold of Prussia had the castle again rebuilt in the style of historicism by architect Albert Geyer, who expanded the central block of the building and added a tower. In 1939, the castle came into possession of the city of Berlin and was used as a storing location for Universum Film AG. After World War II, the castle first housed a cadet school of the Soviet army; in 1947 it became a youth hostel. Additionally, many families found a new home there after the Russians cleared out Berlin and Neubabelsberg. One of the families was the family of an ex-mayor of Berlin. Castle and park also served as a film backdrop, e.g. for Mädchen in Uniform starring Romy Schneider in 1958. From 1961, the castle was located immediately adjacent to the Berlin Wall. In 1962-64, Max Taut rebuilt the castle by adding a glass bay to the two lower floors. Between 1964 and 2003, the castle was used as a youth meeting place. Since 2003, the castle is home of the Sozialpädagogische Fortbildung Jagdschloss Glienicke. On March 31, 2003, the south wing of the castle caught fire as a result of faulty wiring.Fire destroys roof of world heritage site hunting lodge, The Telegraph, April 1, 2003. Because the castle had no fire alarm and its water intakes had become clogged with silt, the resulting damage was particularly severe and has yet to be fully repaired. A rebuild in line with accepted conservation practice began in November 2005. The topping-out ceremony was on August 23, 2006. The awarding authority was the Senate Office For Education, Science and Research. The price for the rebuilding of the roof was approximately €400,000.

By short shifting, the engine does not reach its power band, and therefore maximum vehicle acceleration is not attained for the gear from which the short shift was performed. In racing, short-shifting is a technique intended to avoid losing valuable acceleration time changing gears later. Although this means not being able to accelerate using the engine's peak power at the moment of the gear change, total acceleration overtime may be greater as no acceleration can happen during the gear change. This can aid overtaking by ensuring that the car is in the right gear in anticipation of a maneuver. The most common reason for a short-shift in day-to-day driving is to improve fuel economy. By keeping the engine at the lower end of its RPM range less fuel is consumed. This is especially common in \\"torquey\\" vehicles, vehicles whose engine torque curve peaks at lower RPM than the power curve, because the higher torque at low RPM allows for better acceleration characteristics without winding the engine up into its powerband. Many diesel truck drivers practice a specific type of short-shifting called progressive shifting, wherein the RPM shift point is increased with each gear but is still short of the power band. Another reason is to intentionally reduce power and/or torque to improve traction in sub-optimal road conditions. For example, applying full engine power to the drive-wheels on wet or icy roads may cause the wheels to slip. Likewise, short-shifting can help maintain vehicle stability through bends by avoiding an unsettling shift in balance mid-corner.

Ramon Augustine Martinez in Cuba on August 25, 1964) is the graffiti tag of a Cuban-American commercial artist, illustrator, and ex-golden glove boxer. PRIZ-ONE Tag History Martinez's parents immigrated to New York City during the turbulent Castro era. Martinez started street bombing under various aliases such as RM/MR, SWAN-ONE, PRISM as well as PRIZM, above ground and below Riverside Park. He started \\"motioning\\" on the inside of an IRT Broadway no. 1 train in the summer of 1979. His self-taught progression to painting subway car exteriors did not reach its full potential until several years later. While attending P.S. 9 located on the Upper West Side, he became heavily influenced by Dean, Jean13 and other writers from Brandeis High School, who would later be known as \\"BYB\\", the Bad Yard Boys. His tag pseudonym of Priz/Priz-One originated from the Prisma font of a letterset/typography book that was given as a gift by his high school art teacher because of the potential the teacher saw in Martinez’s black books. In the early 1980s Martinez was befriended by STAN-ONE, an older seasoned Broadway writer who was also president of a well-known graffiti crew called TS5/TSF (The Spanish Five). Martinez began teaming up with several members of TS5 on writing ventures and gaining access to layups and yards. Throughout his writing career he would be accepted into numerous graffiti crews. In the late 1980s Martinez was granted membership to Cool Art Creators (CAC), where he still holds a prominent role. Though his passion is for his artform, he has broadened his vision by presenting works in books and video. Priz-One has been interviewed for several websites, ezines and in The New York Times. He is Vice President of TS5 and continues to paint legally commissioned murals throughout the five boroughs with his partner STAN-ONE.

It was established in 1650, shortly after the island had become an English colony, and flourished as a successful agricultural industrial enterprise during the centuries of slavery. It was the first large-scale sugar plantation to operate in Antigua and belonged to the Codrington family from 1674 until 1944. Christopher Codrington, later Captain General of the Leeward Islands, acquired the property in 1674 and named it Betty's Hope, after his daughter. Betty's Hope is no longer operational as a plantation. However, the structures pictured here at the time of restoration works initiated by the Government of Antigua in 1990, under the OEC/ESDU Eco-Tourism Enhancement project, consisted of the twin windmills, the Cistern Complex in serviceable condition, the Great House (Buff or Estate House) in ruins, the Boiling House where sixteen copper hoppers were used to boil cane juice to produce crystalline sugar, and the Still House, a distillery used for manufacturing rum (also seen in ruins without a roof but with elegant arches). Since 1995, the buildings have been developed as an open-air museum with a visitor center and are managed by the Museum of Antigua and Barbuda. Geography Betty's Hope estate is in a rural area where the geological formation, in a rolling landscape, is limestone. Its location is at , to the south of the township of Pares. History History of the sugar plantation at Betty's Hope is traced to the early 1650s when Governor Christopher Keynell founded it in Antigua. After his death, his wife inherited the estate, in 1663. However, in 1666 she abandoned it, during the French occupation of the islands. The English recaptured the island and decided to award the estate, in 1674, to the Codrington family who were then resident in Barbados, as the government considered the earlier owners to have been disloyal to the Crown, having deserted the estate before the French occupied the island. Under the ownership of the Codringtons, the emphasis centered on sugar, following the earlier dominance of tobacco, indigo, and ginger crops in Antigua. The Codrington owners distinguished themselves by ensuring that Betty's Hope was developed and functioned as the most efficient large-scale sugar estate in Antigua. Two of their family members had the distinction of holding posts of the Governor General of the Leeward Islands between 1689 and 1704; even subsequently the members of the family also had their name established as one of the most influential and prosperous planters during the colonial rule. The estate was managed by a few Europeans, but the basic hard skilled and unskilled labour force was provided by the African slaves, which brought accolades to the estate (and then known as the \\"flagship estate of Antigua\\"); the slaves were later emancipated in 1834 and they continued to serve the estate as freed labour. The Codringtons had 150 sugar mills in Antigua, of which Betty's Hope was the first one where they had introduced technology innovations and ideas to carry out large scale cultivation, extraction and manufacture of sugar. In 1680, there were 393 slaves working on the estate. However, from 1921, sugarcane was extracted at the Central Sugar Factory, even though the Betty's Hope sugar mill was functional. After the Codrington family returned to England, the estate was managed by attorneys, till the early 1900s. In 1944, Betty's Hope was sold by the Codringtons to the Antigua Sugar Estates Ltd. The reasons for discarding the windmill technology for cane juice extraction was the introduction of steam. Consequent to this change, the machinery in the windmill was shifted to the boiling house complex and reinstalled next to the new steam engines. The buildings, however, became storerooms for scrap iron and other debris. As result, the Antiguan economy is no more sugar centric but is now more dependent on tourism, and Betty's Hope now remains a part of this economy. Extraction process In the 18th century (1737 as per a plaque at the main entrance), at Betty's Hope, twin windmills were used to crush sugar cane. Initially, the windmills had three vertical rollers to crush the cane fed by two men and it could crush and extract only 60% of cane juice even after two rounds of crushing. This process underwent improvements with three horizontally placed rollers which increased the efficiency of extraction by another 20%. Each wind driven mill extracted cane juice from cane produced from of land and carted to the mill. The extracted juice was collected in an underground collection chamber from where it was conveyed through a pipe to the boiling house. The bagasse was dried and used as fuel in the boiler and distilling process. The weekly production was generally about 5,500 gallons of cane juice from 200 tonnes of cane. Conservation One of the two restored windmills fixed with the sails A programme of restoration of the heritage status of the Betty's Hope estate, as a major West Indian heritage monument, was initially started by \\"The Friends of Betty's Hope\\", between 1987 and 1990, which eventually was institutionalised as a trust called the \\"Betty's Hope Trust\\", in 1990. The objective was to develop it as an open-air museum and also an interpretation center to bring out the profound influence that the estate had \\"in Antigua and Barbuda's history and influenced the lives of many generations of Antiguans.\\" For this purpose, a committee was set up in 1987–90. Restoration work was started in 1990 and completed in 1995. The Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and the Environmental Sustainable Development Unit (ESDU) launched the Eco-Tourism Enhancement project with a grant support in collaboration with the Government of Antigua and Barbuda to perpetuate the principles of environmental sustainability. One of the two wind mills, cane crushing machinery and sails were restored. The visitor center cum museum is now located in an old cotton house store room where exhibits of plantation's history with estate plans, pictures and maps, artefacts and a model of the central site are displayed. During May 2005, funds were raised for restoration of Betty's Hope by organising a concert called \\"A Penny Concert.\\" The mill was refurbished and the sails of the first windmill were reinstalled in 1995. After recommissioning of the mill, it is run for demonstration purposes on special occasions, since the stone mill walls are old and fragile. However, the sails are kept mounted all through the year. Following the restoration, the Betty's Hope project won the \\"5th Ann. Islands Eco-Tourism Award\\" in 1995. On 28 January 2005, the Eco-Enhancement Upgrade of Betty's Hope was also launched. Archaeological excavations Archaeological research to establish the archaeology of the early colonial period has been initiated at Betty's Hope by the City University New York, Brooklyn. Research had been carried out before and during restoration also, which revealed the operational pattern of the mill. It was established that cane juice produced after milling was not directly led to the boiling-house but was collected at a large iron tank located below the rollers from where it was then pumped to the boiling-house for further processing. Since 2007, excavations by California State University, Chico, have focused on the area of the Great House to correlate the Great House as well as other surrounding buildings, to the site maps recorded in the Codrington Papers. Excavations from 2012 to 2014 have concentrated on the rum distillery and one of the slave villages. References Bibliography *Scott, C. R. (ed.) (2005) Insight guide: Caribbean (5th edition).

A Volksartilleriekorps (VAK) was typically composed of five or six battalions of differing kinds of howitzers and guns, including antitank and anti-aircraft guns. Where deployed, VAKs were normally allocated on the basis of one to two per field army. As an organizational development of massed artillery, VAKs were relative latecomers in World War II and neither numerous enough nor strong enough to counter the massive artillery support of the Red Army or the powerful and expertly controlled corps and army artillery units of the Western Allies. History The first VAKs were organized in September and October 1944, and employed on both the Western and Eastern Fronts. Eventually, 13 VAKs were organized, being numbered 166, 388, 401 - 410, and 766.Tessin, p. 192. In addition to the VAKs, two regiments of Volksartillerie, the 1133rd and 1134th, were organized and employed in support of the Nineteenth Army in Alsace and Baden. VAKs were formed by re-designating existing artillery units and so did not represent an increase in the number of non-divisional artillery battalions supporting the German forces. The first mass employment of VAKs was during the Battle of the Bulge in which several VAKs were used to initially impressive effect during German breakthrough operations. The VAKs, many of whose units used horse-drawn transport, however proved unable to effectively keep pace with the motorized and armored units in the vanguard of the German offensive. Organization VAKs were organized as either partially motorized or fully motorized units. Partially motorized VAKs had motor transport for their artillery pieces with 2/3 of the remaining equipment being horse-drawn.Sawicki, p. 100. The number of authorized trucks ranged from 124 to 406, depending on the type of VAK.Keilig, Part 112, pp. 10a-10b. The parlous state of German army motor transport in the final months of the war, however, meant that even fully motorized units often did not have enough prime movers to swiftly redeploy their artillery pieces as the flow of battle demanded. Besides the degree of motorization, VAKs were also distinguished as \\"Type I\\" (six battalions of artillery) or \\"Type II\\" (five battalions of artillery). Type I VAKs were authorized: * One battalion of 18 7.5 cm antitank guns used in a field gun role * One battalion of 18 8.8 cm antitank guns used in a field gun role * One battalion of 18 10.5 cm howitzers * One battalion of 12 122 mm howitzers (probably captured from Soviet Union troops) * One battalion of 12 15 cm howitzers * One battalion of six 21 cm guns and three 17 cm guns Type II VAKs were authorized: * One battalion of 18 7.5 cm antitank guns used in a field gun role * One battalion of 12 10 cm guns * One battalion of 18 10.5 cm howitzers * One battalion of 12 122 mm howitzers * One battalion of 12 152 mm howitzers (probably captured from Soviet Union troops) Corps headquarters for Type I fully motorized VAKs included an observation battery.Nafziger, p. 365.

The species inhabits coastal waters throughout the Indo-West Pacific region from South Africa in the west to Japan in the east, often found near the water's surface. The cleftbelly trevally is the only member of the genus Atropus and is distinguished by a number of anatomical characteristics, with a deep median groove in the belly giving the species its common name. It is not a large fish, growing to a maximum recorded length of 26.5 cm. Cleftbelly trevally are predatory fish, taking a variety of small crustaceans and fish. The species is of minor importance to fisheries throughout its range. Taxonomy and naming The cleftbelly trevally is the only species in the genus Atropus, which is one of 31 genera in the jack family, Carangidae. The Carangidae are part of the order Carangiformes. The species was first scientifically described under the name of Brama atropos by German ichthyologists Marcus Elieser Bloch and Johann Gottlob Schneider in the massive 1801 volume of Systema Ichthyologiae iconibus cx illustratum, a document which is the taxonomic authority for many species. Bloch and Schneider placed the species in the genus Brama, within the pomfret family. The generic position of the species was revised twice, once being placed in the jack genus, Caranx, and finally into Atropus. The genus Atropus had been informally created by Georges Cuvier in 1817 as \\"Les Atropus\\", and was formally Latinized by Lorenz Oken, thus making him the author of the genus. A. atropos is the type species of the genus by monotypy. The type specimen was taken from the waters of Puducherry, in India. The fact that the generic and specific names differ by a single letter has also led to the misspelling of the species as Atropus atropus in some publications. The species is most commonly referred to in English as the cleftbelly trevally, with other names including cleftbelly kingfish, Kuweh trevally and thin crevalle. It is also occasionally called the 'blackfin jack', but should not be confused with Hemicaranx zelotes, also known by that name. Description Male cleftbelly trevallyThe cleftbelly trevally has a body shape similar in many ways to a number of the larger jacks, with a strongly compressed body almost ovate in shape. The dorsal profile of the head is straight and steep from the tip of the upper jaw to above the eye where the profile becomes convex. The eye lacks an adipose eyelid, and the upper jaw has a narrow band of small teeth, while the lower jaw has two or three rows of small teeth which narrow to one row on the sides of the jaw. The ventral profile is concave upwards, with a major distinguishing feature of the species being a deep median groove along the belly, into which the large pelvic fins fold, also encompassing the first two anal fin spines and anus. The entire chest from underneath the pectoral fins to the base of the pelvic fins is scaleless. There are two separate dorsal fins, the first with eight spines and the second with a single spine followed by 19 to 22 soft rays. The anal fin has two detached spines before the major part of the anal fin, which consists of one spine and 17 or 18 soft rays. The pectoral and pelvic fins are both quite long, with the latter extending almost to the anal fin origin. The lateral line has a moderately strong arch anteriorally which intersects the straight section underneath the fifth to seventh dorsal rays. The straight part of the lateral line has 31-37 scutes.A cleftbelly trevally at an Indian market There are 24 vertebrae and 29 to 34 total gill rakers. The species is known to reach 26.5 cm in length, although often encountered below 20 cm. The cleftbelly trevally is a bluish green on the upper body which fades to silver on the underside of the fish. The membranes of the large pelvic fin are a distinctive black, while the remaining fins are a pale white colour. Juveniles have indistinct dark bands across their bodies, with a black spot becoming more prominent in adults. The species show sexual dimorphism in their dorsal fins, with mature males having between 6 and 12 elongated soft rays, strung out into filaments of varying lengths. The anal fin is also has five similar extensions of the soft rays. Females do not show this elongation. Distribution and habitat The cleftbelly trevally inhabits the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-West Pacific region. Its range extends from South Africa along the east African coast including the Persian Gulf, east to India, Southeast Asia, the Philippines, Taiwan and southern Japan. Some sources state the Persian Gulf as the westernmost point of the species range, but specimens sent to Henry Fowler from South and eastern Africa in the 1930s show this to be incorrect. The species inhabit shallow coastal waters, where they swim close to the surface. There has been a report of the species living in areas near estuaries which empty large flows of fresh water into these areas, indicating the species may be able to live in estuarine environments. Biology and fishery The cleftbelly trevally is a predatory species, preying on small crustaceans including shrimps, copepods and decapods, as well as small fish. Reproduction in the species has not been extensively studied, although early growth has been described in a 1984 article. The study was located in India, and showed the fish grows 12.4 cm in its first year of life, growing slower in its second and third years, adding 7.35 cm and 3.5 cm to its total length, respectively, in these years. The species reaches sexual maturity at 21 cm, in the second or third year of its life. The species is of minor importance to fisheries throughout its range, taken mainly by trawls, traps and by various hook-and-line methods.

The plant is covered with large, glistening bladder cells or water vesicles, reflected in its common names of common ice plant, crystalline ice plant or ice plant. Description A close view of the bladder cells Mesembryanthemum crystallinum is covered with enlarged epidermal cells, called \\"bladder cells\\". The main function of these bladder cells is to reserve water. It flowers from spring to early summer. Flowers open in the morning and close at night, and are insect pollinated. It can be annual, biennial or perennial, but its life cycle is usually completed within several months, depending on environmental conditions. Habitat Mesembryanthemum crystallinum is found on a wide range of soil types, from well-drained sandy soils (including sand dunes), to loamy and clay soils. It can tolerate nutritionally poor or saline soils. As with many introduced species it also grows in disturbed sites such as roadsides, rubbish dumps and homestead yards. Biology The plant usually uses C3 carbon fixation, but when it becomes water- or salt-stressed, it is able to switch to Crassulacean acid metabolism. Like many salt-tolerant plants, M. crystallinum accumulates salt throughout its life, in a gradient from the roots to the shoots, with the highest concentration stored in epidermal bladder cells. The salt is released by leaching once the plant dies. This results in a detrimental osmotic environment preventing the growth of other, non-salt-tolerant species while allowing M. crystallinum seeds to germinate. In M. crystallinum, the number of seeds produced depends on whether CAM has been activated (C3 metabolism is more efficient) and the size the plant has grown to in its juvenile growth phase. During seed production, older portions of the plant progressively die off and dry out. The developing seed capsules continue to sequester salt and produce viable seeds. Seeds at the top of the capsule generally germinate immediately on imbibation while seeds at the base may remain dormant for longer than four weeks.  History  The plant was once promoted in the United States and Europe as a vegetable, but failed to gain popularity. Uses A younger plant in Lanzarote Its leaves are edible, as with some other members of the family Aizoaceae. In southern Africa, the leaves and stems are gathered from the wild and pickled. Ice plants are also used in South Africa as a way of deterring fires, or \\"firescaping\\" gardens. Seeds can also be eaten. The crushed leaves can be used as a soap substitute and have some medicinal uses. It is rarely, if ever, grazed upon by domestic stock. It is also cultivated for ornamentation. Due to its salt accumulation, M. crystallinum may be useful for bio-remediation.

Biography  He commanded a Burgundian flotilla organized by Philip III the Good, Duke of Burgundy () in May 1441 at the request from the Knights Hospitaller to help defend Rhodes against the Mamluk Sultan of Egypt. The duke went in person to Sluis to see off his flotilla. Throughout 1442, de Thoisy’s force was based at Rhodes, harassing the Muslim shipping and coastline. Having refitted at Villefranche, it was again in action off the North African coast and Rhodes in 1444. When a second Mamluk fleet assailed the island, the Burgundians helped the Hospitallers lift the siege of the town of Rhodes which lasted for forty days.Nicholson, Helen J. (2001), The Knights Hospitaller, pp. 57-8. Boydell & Brewer, . Next, in response to the Byzantine appeal for help against the Ottoman advance, Philip instructed de Thoisy to lead his squadron to reinforce a squadron of four galleys built or hired at Nice and Venice, commanded by Waleran de Wavrin, to join Pope Eugene IV's planned Crusade. De Wavrin's four galleys sailed in July 1444 but failed to stop Murad II's Anatolian army from crossing the Bosporus. De Thoisy joined de Wavrin's squadron at Constantinople, where the latter had gone to spend the winter. In the meantime, the crusading army led by Wladyslaw III of Poland (Ulaszlo I as king of Hungary) and Janos Hunyadi had been severely defeated by the united Anatolian and Rumelian armies of Murad II, on 10 November 1444, on the plain before Varna, on the coast of the Black Sea. In the spring of 1445, de Wavrin sailed to the Danube to join the Hungarians in the continuing Crusade, while de Thoisy took his ships along the south coast of the Black Sea. He engaged in piracy there, plundering both ships and coastal settlements, covering the expenses for the re-equipment of his ships at Trebizond with five slave-women, worth in all 164 ducats. Then, de Thoisy decided to continue to the coast of Georgia, hoping to capture vessels carrying silk. Although the Emperor of Trebizond warned him that the people of Georgia were Christians, de Thoisy went ahead with his campaign, claiming that his orders were to fight all schismatics who did not obey the Pope. However, some Greeks from Trebizond informed the Georgians who, when they saw the galley coming, took up arms and waited in ambush. As soon as Thoisy landed at the port of Vaty (Batumi), the ambushers attacked, killing many of his men and taking him captive. The ones who managed to escape fled to the Genoese port of Caffa (modern Feodosiya, Ukraine) and reported to de Wavrin who dispatched the Hospitaller knight Sir Regnault de Confide to ask the Emperor of Trebizond to mediate for Thoisy’s release. The Emperor was quick to send to Georgia and, by these means, Sir Geoffrey was set free. He was put safely on board the galley and sailed to Caffa, capturing on the way two Greek vessels with cargoes of fish. Eventually, de Thoisy's piracy led to a protest from the government of Genoa to the Duke of Burgundy. This forced de Thoisy to return to Constantinople, where he was invited by de Wavrin to join the forthcoming expedition with the Hungarians and Vlachs. He preferred to return with his ships to Nice and Villefranche, however.Imber, Colin (2006), The Crusade of Varna, pp. 33-4, 137-8. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., .

The 16th President in the Wheelock Succession, he served as Dartmouth president from 1998 until 2009. He joined the Dartmouth History Department in 1969 and served as dean of faculty from 1989 to 1997 and as provost from 1997 to 1998. Wright received a bachelor's degree from the University of Wisconsin–Platteville and a masters and doctoral degree in history from the University of Wisconsin–Madison.  Early life  James Wright grew up in Galena, Illinois, a small Midwestern town in the 1950s, the son of a World War II veteran. He enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1957, at age 17. Three years later upon his discharge he went to college. He worked as a laborer in a cheese plant and as a janitor, bartender, and night watchman in order to pay for his education. He also worked at the local zinc mines, including working as a powderman, setting dynamite charges. Encouraged by his undergraduate faculty mentors and enabled by the Danforth Fellowship, he went on to graduate school and became an academic.  Presidency at Dartmouth College  As president, Wright’s priorities included advancing the academic strength of the institution and expanding the faculty, enhancing the out-of-the-classroom experience, strengthening Dartmouth's historic commitment to a strong and inclusive sense of community, building and renovating Dartmouth’s facilities and strengthening the College's financial resources. He worked to more fully integrate the professional schools into the intellectual life of the College. During his presidency undergraduate applications grew by 79 percent and the student body became increasingly diverse, with students of color and international students representing more than 40 percent of the student body. The College also made significant improvements to the financial aid program, including: tripling the budget for undergraduate aid, expanding its need-blind admissions policies to include international students, eliminating loans for all students and offering free tuition to students who come from families with incomes at or below $75,000. President Wright focused on advancing the academic strength of the College by expanding and diversifying the faculty; resulting in more than 10 percent growth in the faculty of the Arts & Sciences, an 8:1 student-faculty ratio, and the highest percentage of tenured women faculty in the Ivy League and among the highest percentage of faculty of color. The three professional schools all participated in similar patterns of growth and improvement. Leading the College's $1.3 billion campaign - the largest fund-raising effort in its history - Wright provided additional resources for faculty support, including: the creation of more than 20 new endowed professorships, increased compensation and research funding, and the construction of Berry and Rauner Special Collections Libraries, Carson Hall, Moore Hall, Kemeny Hall, and the Haldeman Center. Wright enhanced the out-of-classroom experience by investing in new residence halls and off-campus housing for students, renovating or building new athletic and recreation facilities, and subsidizing student tickets to the Hopkins Center and athletic events. Under his stewardship, the College’s endowment and annual fundraising more than doubled, with more than 67 percent of all alumni/ae making gifts to the Campaign for the Dartmouth Experience.  Work with veterans  In 2005, Wright began a series of visits to U.S. military medical facilities in Washington, D.C., where he met Marines and other U.S. military personnel who had been wounded in the course of service in Iraq and Afghanistan. In over thirty visits since then, he has encouraged the injured servicemen and women to continue their education. President Wright worked with Senators Jim Webb, John Warner, and Chuck Hagel on language for the GI Bill that was passed by Congress and signed by President Bush in June 2008, to provide a means for private institutions to partner with Veterans Affairs in supporting veterans who matriculated at these institutions (the \\"Yellow Ribbon Program\\"). He also worked with the American Council on Education (ACE) to create a new educational counseling program for wounded U.S. veterans. It has served several hundred injured veterans since 2007, and continues today at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center at Bethesda. He served as an honorary co-chair for the fall 2008 and the fall 2009 dinner of the Iraq-Afghanistan Veterans of America. President Wright wrote the Spring 2008 cover story on veterans in higher education for The Presidency, a publication of the American Council on Education for college and university presidents. He spoke about some of this work on February 2, 2009, at the annual meeting of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. Since he stepped down from the Dartmouth presidency in 2009, Wright has focused on support of veterans and research, writing, and public speaking on matters relating to education and veterans. His scholarly work as a political historian has extended to include military history and questions about American culture and war. On Veterans Day 2009, Wright spoke at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. at the invitation of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund. As the Jefferson Memorial Lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley in February 2010, he delivered \\"War Veterans and American Democracy\\" and was a participant in a follow-up panel about veterans. Wright has lectured and participated in discussions at Texas A&M; University, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Norwich University, Rollins College, and the United States Military Academy at West Point, as well as Seoul National University and at Yonsei University in Seoul. Wright was a speaker at the 2012 Sun Valley Writers’ Conference (he had earlier spoken at the Conference in 2002), and in 2013 he was the speaker for the Veterans Day Program at the Abraham Lincoln Library. He participated in a “National Veterans’ Strategy Roundtable” organized by the House Committee on Veterans Affairs and convened at the Library of Congress in September 2013. Wright was one of the speakers at the 2014 Veterans Day Symposium of Veterans on Wall Street, hosted by Goldman Sachs. Other speakers included General Martin Dempsey and Bob Woodruff. In his 44th year at Dartmouth, Wright taught a senior seminar on America’s wars in the winter term of 2013 and again in 2014. Over the last few years, he has written articles that have appeared in online publications, Foreign Affairs, The Atlantic, and the Huffington Post. The theme that runs through all of these is the way that American society largely ignores those who fight and sacrifice in the country’s wars. Wright was a commentator in the Harvard Business School case study and supporting film produced by Linda Bilmes. This deals with the merging of the Walter Reed and Bethesda Hospitals. He also participated in director Ric Burn's film, \\"Debt of Honor: A History of Disabled Veterans in America,\\" which was shown at the New York Historical Society on November 9, followed by a panel discussion with Ric Burns, James Wright, Charles Marmar, and Jose Rene \\"J.R.\\" Martinez. The film, which aired nationally on PBS on November 10, 2015 examines the rise of disabled veterans in the country. Improved battlefield medicine has led to fewer wartime fatalities, but also to more severe injuries for survivors. Veterans of each war have come home to different attitudes about their service and their war, which has had long-reaching effects on their recovery. James Wright serves on the Board of the Semper Fi Fund/America's Fund.

Suggestibility, activation of associated information, the incorporation of misinformation and source misattribution have been suggested to be several mechanisms underlying a variety of types of false memory phenomena. False memories are a component of False Memory Syndrome (FMS). Early work The false memory phenomenon was initially investigated by psychological pioneers Pierre Janet and Sigmund Freud. Sigmund Freud is known to be the founder of psychoanalysis, a field of psychology that has been deemed by many as dead or dying. One thing that has kept it alive is the emphasis Freud put on his study of memory. Freud was fascinated with memory and all the ways it could be understood, used, and manipulated. Some claim that his studies have been quite influential in contemporary memory research, including the research into the field of false memory.Knafo, D. (2009). Freud's memory erased. Psychoanalytic Psychology, 26(2), 171–190. Pierre Janet was a French Neurologist also credited with great contributions into memory research. Pierre contributed to false memory through his ideas on dissociation and memory retrieval through hypnosis.Zongwill, O. L. (2019). Memory abnormality. Retrieved from https://www.britannica.com/science/memory- abnormality In 1974, Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer conducted a study to investigate the effects of language on the development of false memory. The experiment involved two separate studies. In the first test, 45 participants were randomly assigned to watch different videos of a car accident, in which separate videos had shown collisions at , and . Afterwards, participants filled out a survey. The survey asked the question, \\"About how fast were the cars going when they smashed into each other?\\" The question always asked the same thing, except the verb used to describe the collision varied. Rather than \\"smashed\\", other verbs used included \\"bumped\\", \\"collided\\", \\"hit\\", or \\"contacted\\". Participants estimated collisions of all speeds to average between to just below . If actual speed was the main factor in estimate, it could be assumed that participants would have lower estimates for lower speed collisions. Instead, the word being used to describe the collision seemed to better predict the estimate in speed rather than the speed itself. The second experiment also showed participants videos of a car accident, but the phrasing of the follow-up questionnaire was critical in participant responses. 150 participants were randomly assigned to three conditions. Those in the first condition were asked the same question as the first study using the verb \\"smashed\\". The second group was asked the same question as the first study, replacing \\"smashed\\" with \\"hit\\". The final group was not asked about the speed of the crashed cars. The researchers then asked the participants if they had seen any broken glass, knowing that there was no broken glass in the video. The responses to this question had shown that the difference between whether broken glass was recalled or not heavily depended on the verb used. A larger sum of participants in the \\"smashed\\" group declared that there was broken glass. In this study, the first point brought up in discussion is that the words used to phrase a question can heavily influence the response given. Second, the study indicates that the phrasing of a question can give expectations to previously ignored details, and therefore, a misconstruction of our memory recall. This indication supports false memory as an existing phenomenon. Replications in different contexts (such as hockey games instead of car crashes) have shown that different scenarios require different framing effects to produce differing memories.  Manifestations and types  = Mandela effect = False memories can sometimes be shared by multiple people. This is sometimes called the Mandela effect. One prominent example comes from a 2010 study that examined people familiar with the clock at Bologna Centrale railway station, which was damaged in the Bologna massacre bombing in August 1980. In the study, 92% of respondents falsely remembered the clock had remained stopped since the bombing when, in fact, the clock was repaired shortly after the attack. Years later the clock was again stopped and set to the time of the bombing in observance and commemoration of the bombing. Other such examples include memories of the Berenstain Bears' name being spelled Berenstein, and of the existence of a 1990s movie entitled Shazaam starring comedian Sinbad as a genie. The Bologna station clock, subject of a collective false memory In 2010 this shared false memory phenomenon was dubbed the Mandela effect by self-described \\"paranormal consultant\\" Fiona Broome in reference to her false memory of the death of South African anti-Apartheid leader Nelson Mandela in prison in the 1980s (he actually died in 2013, after having served as President of South Africa from 1994-99), which she claimed was shared by \\"perhaps thousands\\" of other people. Scientists suggest that these are examples of false memories shaped by similar cognitive factors affecting multiple people and family, such as social and cognitive reinforcement of incorrect memories or false news reports and misleading photographs that influence the formation of memories based on them. For example, the false memories of Shazaam have been explained as a confabulation of memories of the comedian wearing a genie-like costume during a TV presentation of Sinbad the Sailor movies in 1994,28 December 1994, on the cable channel TNT; the marathon featured movies including Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger (1977). and a similarly named 1996 film Kazaam featuring a genie played by Shaquille O'Neal. In addition, in 1960s, Hanna-Barbera had an animated series about a genie called Shazzan. =Presuppositions and the misinformation effect= A presupposition is an implication through chosen language. If a person is asked, \\"What shade of blue was the wallet?\\", the questioner is, in translation, saying, \\"The wallet was blue. What shade was it?\\" The question's phrasing provides the respondent with a supposed \\"fact\\". This presupposition creates one of two separate effects: true effect and false effect. * In true effect, the implication was accurate: the wallet really was blue. That makes the respondent's recall stronger, more readily available, and easier to extrapolate from. A respondent is more likely to remember a wallet as blue if the prompt said that it was blue, than if the prompt did not say so. * In false effect, the implication was actually false: the wallet was not blue even though the question asked what shade of blue it was. This convinces the respondent of its truth (i.e., that the wallet was blue), which affects their memory. It can also alter responses to later questions to keep them consistent with the false implication. Regardless of the effect being true or false, the respondent is attempting to conform to the supplied information, because they assume it to be true. Loftus' meta-analysis on language manipulation studies suggested the misinformation effect taking hold on the recall process and products of the human memory. Even the smallest adjustment in a question, such as the article preceding the supposed memory, could alter the responses. For example, having asked someone if they had seen \\"the\\" stop sign, rather than \\"a\\" stop sign, provided the respondent with a presupposition that there was a stop sign in the scene. This presupposition increased the number of people responding that they had indeed seen the stop sign. The strength of verbs used in conversation or questioning also has a similar effect on the memory; for example – the words met, bumped, collided, crashed, or smashed would all cause people to remember a car accident at different levels of intensity. The words bumped, hit, grabbed, smacked, or groped would all paint a different picture of a person in the memory of an observer of sexual harassment if questioned about it later. The stronger the word, the more intense the recreation of the experience in the memory is. This in turn could trigger further false memories to better fit the memory created (change how a person looks or how fast a vehicle was moving before an accident).Malpass, R. S. (2004). Misinformation effect. Encyclopedia of Applied Psychology, Retrieved from https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/misinformation-effect =Word lists= One can trigger false memories by presenting subjects a continuous list of words. When subjects were presented with a second version of the list and asked if the words had appeared on the previous list, they found that the subjects did not recognize the list correctly. When the words on the two lists were semantically related to each other (e.g. sleep/bed), it was more likely that the subjects did not remember the first list correctly and created false memories (Anisfeld & Knapp, 1963). In 1998 Kathleen McDermott and Henry Roediger III conducted a similar experiment. Their goal was to intentionally trigger false memories through word lists. They presented subjects with lists to study all containing a large number of words that that were semantically related to another word that was not found on the list. For example, if the word that they were trying to trigger was “river” the list would contain words such as flow, current, water, stream, bend, etc. They would then take the lists away and ask the subjects to recall the words on the lists. Almost every time the false memory was triggered and the subjects would end up recalling the target word as part of the list when it was never there. Mc Dermott and Roediger even went as far as informing the subjects of the purpose and details of the experiment, and still the subjects would recall the non listed target word as part of the word list they had studied.McDermott, K. B., & Roediger III, H. L. (1998). Attempting to avoid illusory memories: Robust false recognition of associates persists under conditions of explicit warnings and immediate testing. Journal of Memory and Language, 39(3), 508-520. =Staged naturalistic events= Subjects were invited into an office and were told to wait there. After this they had to recall the inventory of the visited office. Subjects recognized objects consistent with the “office schema” although they did not appear in the office. (Brewer & Treyens, 1981) In another study, subjects were presented with a situation where they witnessed a staged robbery. Half of the subjects witnessed the robbery live while the other half watched a video of the robbery as it took place. After the event, they were sat down and asked to recall what had happened during the robbery. The results surprisingly showed that those who watched the video of the robbery actually recalled more information more accurately than those who were live on the scene. Still false memory presented itself in ways such as subjects seeing things that would fit in a crime scene that weren't there, or not recalling things that don't fit the crime scene. This happened with both parties, displaying the idea of staged naturalistic events.Ihlebæk, C., Løve, T., Erik Eilertsen, D., & Magnussen, S. (2003). Memory for a staged criminal event witnessed live and on video. Memory, 11(3), 319-327. =Relational processing= Memory retrieval has been associated with the brain's relational processing. In associating two events (in reference to false memory, say tying a testimony to a prior event), there are verbatim and gist representations. Verbatim matches to the individual occurrences (e.g., I do not like dogs because when I was five a chihuahua bit me) and gist matches to general inferences (e.g., I do not like dogs because they are mean). Keeping in line with the fuzzy-trace theory, which suggests false memories are stored in gist representations (which retrieves both true and false recall), Storbeck & Clore (2005) wanted to see how change in mood affected the retrieval of false memories. After using the measure of a word association tool called the Deese–Roediger–McDermott paradigm (DRM), the subjects' moods were manipulated. Moods were either oriented towards being more positive, more negative, or were left untouched. Findings suggested that a more negative mood made critical details, stored in gist representation, less accessible. This would imply that false memories are less likely to occur when a subject was in a worse mood.  Theories  = Strength hypothesis (situational strength) = The strength hypothesis states that in strong situations (situations where one course of action is encouraged more than any other course of action due to the objective payoff) people are expected to demonstrate rational behavior, basing their behavior on the objective payoff.Lozano, J. H. (2018). The situational strength hypothesis and the measurement of personality. Social Psychological and Personality Science, 9(1), 70-79. doi:10.1177/1948550617699256 Current laws present a great example of this. Most people, no matter how daring, will conform to the laws of the land because the objective payoff means they receive safety and security. =Construction hypothesis= The construction hypothesis says that if a true piece of information being provided can alter a respondent's answer, then so can a false piece of information. Construction hypothesis has major implications for explanations on the malleability of memory. Upon asking a respondent a question that provides a presupposition, the respondent will provide a recall in accordance with the presupposition (if accepted to exist in the first place). The respondent will recall the object or detail. =Skeleton theory= Loftus developed what some refer to as \\"the skeleton theory\\" after having run an experiment involving 150 subjects from the University of Washington. Loftus noticed that when a presupposition was one of false information it could only be explained by the construction hypothesis and not the strength hypothesis. Loftus then stated that a theory needed to be created for complex visual experiences where the construction hypothesis plays a significantly more important role than situational strength. She presented a diagram as a “skeleton” of this theory, which later became referred to by some as the skeleton theory. The skeleton theory explains the procedure of how a memory is recalled, which is split into two categories: the acquisition processes and the retrieval processes. The acquisition processes are in three separate steps. First, upon the original encounter, the observer selects a stimulus to focus on. The information that the observer can focus on compared to all of the information occurring in the situation as a whole, is very limited. In other words, a lot is going on around us and we only pick up on a small portion. This forces the observer to begin by selecting a focal point for focus. Second, our visual perception must be translated into statements and descriptions. The statements represent a collection of concepts and objects; they are the link between the event occurrence and the recall. Third, the perceptions are subject to any \\"external\\" information being provided before or after the interpretation. This subsequent set of information can reconstruct the memory. The retrieval processes come in two steps. First, the memory and imagery are regenerated. This perception is subject to what foci the observer has selected, along with the information provided before or after the observation. Second, the linking is initiated by a statement response, \\"painting a picture\\" to make sense of what was observed. This retrieval process results in either an accurate memory or a false memory. Natural factors for the formation of false memories =Individual differences= Greater creative imagination and dissociation are known to relate to false memory formation. Creative imagination may lead to vivid details of imagined events. High dissociation may be associated with habitual use of lax response criteria for source decisions due to frequent interruption of attention or consciousness. Social desirability and false memory have also been examined. Social desirability effects may depend on the level of perceived social pressure. Individuals who feel under greater social pressure may be more likely to acquiesce. Perceived pressure from an authority figure may lower individuals' criteria for accepting a false event as true. The new individual difference factors include preexisting beliefs about memory, self-evaluation of one's own memory abilities, trauma symptoms, and attachment styles. Regarding the first of these, metamemory beliefs about the malleability of memory, the nature of trauma memory, and the recoverability of lost memory may influence willingness to accept vague impressions or fragmentary images as recovered memories and thus, might affect the likelihood of accepting false memory. For example, if someone believes that memory once encoded is permanent, and that visualization is an effective way to recover memories, the individual may endorse more liberal criteria for accepting a mental image as true memory. Also, individuals who report themselves as having better everyday memories may feel more compelled to come up with a memory when asked to do so. This may lead to more liberal criteria, making these individuals more susceptible to false memory. There is some research that shows individual differences in false memory susceptibility are not always large (even on variables that have previously shown differences—such as creative imagination or dissociation), that there appears to be no false memory trait, and that even those who have highly superior memory are susceptible to false memories. =Trauma= A history of trauma is relevant to the issue of false memory. It has been proposed that people with a trauma history or trauma symptoms may be particularly vulnerable to memory deficits, including source-monitoring failures. Possible associations between attachment styles and reports of false childhood memories were also of interest. Adult attachment styles have been related to memories of early childhood events, suggesting that the encoding or retrieval of such memories may activate the attachment system. It is more difficult for avoidant adults to access negative emotional experiences from childhood, whereas ambivalent adults access these kinds of experiences easily. Consistent with attachment theory, adults with avoidant attachment styles, like their child counterparts, may attempt to suppress physiological and emotional reactions to activation of the attachment system. Significant associations between parental attachment and children's suggestibility exist. These data, however, do not directly address the issue of whether adults' or their parents' attachment styles are related to false childhood memories. Such data nevertheless suggest that greater attachment avoidance may be associated with a stronger tendency to form false memories of childhood. =Sleep deprivation= Sleep deprivation can also affect the possibility of falsely encoding a memory. In two experiments, participants studied DRM lists (lists of words [e.g., bed, rest, awake, tired] that are semantically associated with a non-presented word) before a night of either sleep or sleep deprivation; testing took place the following day. One study showed higher rates of false recognition in sleep-deprived participants, compared with rested participants. Sleep deprivation can increase the risk of developing false memories. Specifically, sleep deprivation increased false memories in a misinformation task when participants in a study were sleep deprived during event encoding, but did not have a significant effect when the deprivation occurred after event encoding. = False memory syndrome = False memory syndrome recognizes false memory as a prevalent part of one's life in which it affects the person's mentality and day-to-day life. False memory syndrome differs from false memory in that the syndrome is heavily influential in the orientation of a person's life, while false memory can occur without this significant effect. The syndrome takes effect because the person believes the influential memory to be true. However, its research is controversial and the syndrome is excluded from identification as a mental disorder and, therefore, is also excluded from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. False memory is an important part of psychological research because of the ties it has to a large number of mental disorders, such as PTSD. The false memory syndrome is loosely defined, and not a part of the DSM. However, the syndrome suggests that false memory can be declared a syndrome when recall of a false or inaccurate memory takes great effect on a person's life. This false memory can completely alter the orientation of your personality and lifestyle. Psychiatry Therapists who subscribe to recovered memory theory point to a wide variety of common problems, ranging from eating disorders to sleeplessness, as evidence of repressed memories of sexual abuse. Psychotherapists tried to reveal “repressed memories” in mental therapy patients through “hypnosis, guided imagery, dream interpretation and narco-analysis”. The reasoning was that if abuse couldn't be remembered, then it needed to be recovered by the therapist. The legal phenomena developed in the 1980s, with civil suits alleging child sexual abuse on the basis of “memories” recovered during psychotherapy. The term “repressed memory therapy” gained momentum and with it social stigma surrounded those accused of abuse. The “therapy” led to other psychological disorders in persons whose memories were recovered. Memories recovered through therapy have become more difficult to distinguish between simply being repressed or having existed in the first place. Therapists have used strategies such as hypnotherapy, repeated questioning, and bibliotherapy. These strategies may provoke the recovery of nonexistent events or inaccurate memories. A recent report indicates that similar strategies may have produced false memories in several therapies in the century before the modern controversy on the topic which took place in the 1980s and 1990s. According to Loftus, there are different possibilities to create false therapy-induced memory. One is the unintentional suggestions of therapists. For example, a therapist might tell their client that, on the basis of their symptoms, it is quite likely that they had been abused as a child. Once this \\"diagnosis\\" is made, the therapist sometimes urges the patient to pursue the recalcitrant memories. It is a problem resulting from the fact that people create their own social reality with external information. The \\"lost-in-the-mall\\" technique is another recovery strategy. This is essentially a repeated suggestion pattern. The person whose memory is to be recovered is persistently said to have gone through an experience even if it may have not happened. This strategy can cause the person to recall the event as having occurred, despite its falsehood. =Hypnosis= Laurence and Perry conducted a study testing the ability to induce memory recall through hypnosis. Subjects were put into a hypnotic state and later woken up. Observers suggested that the subjects were woken up by a loud noise. Nearly half of the subjects being tested concluded that this was true, despite it being false. Although, by therapeutically altering the subject's state, they may have been led to believe that what they were being told was true. Because of this, the respondent has a false recall. A 1989 study focusing on hypnotizability and false memory separated accurate and inaccurate memories recalled. In open-ended question formation, 11.5% of subjects recalled the false event suggested by observers. In a multiple-choice format, no participants claimed the false event had happened. This result led to the conclusion that hypnotic suggestions produce shifts in focus, awareness, and attention. Despite this, subjects do not mix fantasy up with reality. Effects on society =Legal cases= Therapy-induced memory recovery has made frequent appearances in legal cases, particularly those regarding sexual abuse. Therapists can often aid in creating a false memory in a victim's mind, intentionally or unintentionally. They will associate a patient's behavior with the fact that they have been a victim of sexual abuse, thus helping the memory occur. They use memory enhancement techniques such as hypnosis dream analysis to extract memories of sexual abuse from victims. According to the FMSF (False Memory Syndrome Foundation), these memories are false and are produced in the very act of searching for and employing them in a life narrative. In Ramona v. Isabella, two therapists wrongly prompted a recall that their patient, Holly Ramona, had been sexually abused by her father. It was suggested that the therapist, Isabella, had implanted the memory in Ramona after use of the hypnotic drug sodium amytal. After a nearly unanimous decision, Isabella had been declared negligent towards Holly Ramona. This 1994 legal issue played a massive role in shedding light on the possibility of false memories' occurrences. In another legal case where false memories were used, they helped a man to be acquitted of his charges. Joseph Pacely had been accused of breaking into a woman's home with the intent to sexually assault her. The woman had given her description of the assailant to police shortly after the crime had happened. During the trial, memory researcher Elizabeth Loftus testified that memory is fallible and there were many emotions that played a part in the woman's description given to police. Loftus has published many studies consistent with her testimony. These studies suggest that memories can easily be changed around and sometimes eyewitness testimonies are not as reliable as many believe. Another notable case is Maxine Berry. Maxine grew up in the custody of her mother, who opposed the father having contact with her (Berry & Berry, 2001). When the father expressed his desire to attend his daughter's high school graduation, the mother enrolled Maxine in therapy, ostensibly to deal with the stress of seeing her father. The therapist pressed Maxine to recover memories of sex abuse by her father. Maxine broke down under the pressure and had to be psychiatrically hospitalized. She underwent tubal ligation, so she would not have children and repeat the cycle of abuse. With the support of her husband and primary care physician, Maxine eventually realized that her memories were false and filed a suit for malpractice. The suit brought to light the mother's manipulation of mental health professionals to convince Maxine that she had been sexually abused by her father. In February 1997 Maxine Berry sued her therapists and clinic that treated her from 1992-1995 and, she says, made her falsely believe she had been sexually and physically abused as a child when no such abuse ever occurred. The lawsuit, filed in February 1997 in Minnehaha Co. Circuit Court South Dakota, states that therapist Lynda O'Connor-Davis had an improper relationship with Berry, both during and after her treatment. The suit also names psychologist Vail Williams, psychiatrist Dr. William Fuller and Charter Hospital and Charter Counseling Center as defendants. Berry and her husband settled out of court https://www.newspapers.com/clip/29841752/argus-leader/ Although there have been many legal cases in which false memory appears to have been a factor, this does not ease the process of distinguishing between false memory and real recall. Sound therapeutic strategy can help this differentiation, by either avoiding known controversial strategies or to disclosing controversy to a subject. Harold Merskey published a paper on the ethical issues of recovered-memory therapy. He suggests that if a patient had pre-existing severe issues in their life, it is likely that \\"deterioration\\" will occur to a relatively severe extent upon memory recall. This deterioration is a physical parallel to the emotional trauma being surfaced. There may be tears, writhing, or many other forms of physical disturbance. The occurrence of physical deterioration in memory recall coming from a patient with relatively minor issues prior to therapy could be an indication of the recalled memory's potential falsehood. =Children= False memory is often considered for trauma victims including those of childhood sexual abuse. If a child experienced abuse, it is not typical for them to disclose the details of the event when confronted in an open-ended manner. Trying to indirectly prompt a memory recall can lead to the conflict of source attribution, as if repeatedly questioned the child might try to recall a memory to satisfy a question. The stress being put on the child can make recovering an accurate memory more difficult. Some people hypothesise that as the child continuously attempts to remember a memory, they are building a larger file of sources that the memory could be derived from, potentially including sources other than genuine memories. Children that have never been abused but undergo similar response- eliciting techniques can disclose events that never occurred. One of children's most notable setbacks in memory recall is source misattribution. Source misattribution is the flaw in deciphering between potential origins of a memory. The source could come from an actual occurring perception, or it can come from an induced and imagined event. Younger children, preschoolers in particular, find it more difficult to discriminate between the two. Lindsay & Johnson (1987) concluded that even children approaching adolescence struggle with this, as well as recalling an existent memory as a witness. Children are significantly more likely to confuse a source between being invented or existent. For example, Shyamalan, Lamb and Sheldrick (1995) partially re- created a study that involved attempted memory implanting in children. The study comprised a series of interviews concerning a medical procedure that the children may have undergone. The data was scored so that if a child made one false affirmation during the interview, the child was classified as inaccurate. When the medical procedure was described in detail, \\"only 13% of the children answered 'yes' to the question 'Did you ever have this procedure?'\\". As to the success of implantation with false 'memories', the children \\"assented to the question for a variety of reasons, a false memory being only one of them. In sum, it is possible that no false memories have been created in children in implanted-memory studies\\". = Ethics and public opinion = A 2016 study surveyed the public's attitude regarding the ethics of planting false memories as an attempt to influence healthy behavior. People were most concerned with the consequences, with 37% saying it was overly manipulative, potentially harmful or traumatic. Their reasons against are that the ends do not justify the means (32%), potential for abuse (14%), lack of consent (10%), practical doubts (8%), better alternative (7%), and free will (3%). Of those who thought implanting false memories would be acceptable, 36% believed the end justified the means, with other reasons being increasing treatment options (6%), people need support (6%), no harm would be done (6%), and it's no worse than alternatives (5%). An article published in the journal entitled Applied Cognitive Psychology, indicated that the public has mixed sentiments about implanting false memories to improve eating habits, with 41% saying it would be generally unacceptable and 48% saying it would, 25% think it completely unethical while 10% believe the opposite.Nash, Robert. “Future - Would It Be Ethical to Implant False Memories in Therapy?” BBC News, BBC, 6 October 2016, www.bbc.com/future/story/20161003-would-it-be-ethical-to- implant-false-memories-in-therapy. =Potential benefits= Several possible benefits associated with false memory arrive from fuzzy-trace theory and gist memory. Valerie F. Reyna, who coined the terms as an explanation for the DRM paradigm, explains that her findings indicate that reliance on prior knowledge from gist memory can help individuals make safer, well informed choices in terms of risk taking.Dodgson, Lindsay. “It's Possible to Plant False Memories Into Your Brain, And It Could Be a Good Thing.” ScienceAlert, ScienceAlert, www.sciencealert.com/brain-fuzzy-trace-false-memory-advantages- human?perpetual=yes&limitstart;=1. Other positive traits associated with false memory indicate that individuals have superior organizational processes, heightened creativity, and prime solutions for insight based problems. All of these things indicate that false memories are adaptive and functional.“Future Thinking and False Memories.” Psychology Today, Sussex Publishers, www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/time-travelling-apollo/201607/future-thinking- and-false-memories.

Kenneth C. Madsen (October 31, 1927 – December 25, 2002) was an American artist. He was the son of a Danish immigrant father and a mother who influenced his interest in the arts. His most famous work is his 1991 painting, \\"Discovery,\\" a representation of the voyage of Christopher Columbus. The painting graced the program cover of the National Independence Day Festival and Parade in Washington, D.C. In celebration of the Columbus Quincentennial, Utah’s governor Norman H. Bangerter joined the parade organization in presenting the original painting to U.S. President George H. W. Bush for his future Presidential library collection. Biography Beginning at age three Kenneth showed a great interest in visual art. When he was seven years old, he met photographer Ida M. Wilcox, who encouraged him to pursue his artistic talent. On her retirement, she bequeathed to him her multi-adjustable easel and chair. Deseret News art critic Richard P. Christenson wrote the following: \\"After high school, Kenneth joined the Navy and sailed extensively among the South Pacific islands. This gave him ample opportunities to sketch boats, islands, and the many moods of the ocean.\\" In 1945 he won first prize for six pastel paintings that he entered in the Army-Navy-Marine art show, sponsored by the USO in San Diego. After completing his military service, Kenneth entered school at the Art Barn in Salt Lake City where for nine years he studied fine art and commercial art under the direction of some of Utah’s finest artists. The following art teachers influenced his early studies: Michael Cannon, Lorin Folland, Dan Lahey, Lee Dussell, and Gertrude Teutsch. In addition to his studies at the Art Barn, Kenneth completed art courses with the Famous Artists School of Westport, Connecticut. In 1949 he was encouraged to enter a painting in the Junior League Art Show, where he won his first cash prize. About that time, his instructor, Michael Cannon, helped him obtain his first mural commission, which launched his career in fine art. Between commissions, Kenneth worked in commercial art and advertising, selling his work to restaurants, car dealerships, banks, pharmacies, medical centers, and schools. On rare occasions Kenneth exhibited his paintings at private art shows and in local art galleries, including an exhibit at the Reno Little Theater in Nevada and another at the Panache Restaurant in Draper, Utah.\\"Madsen…Art on Display at Theater,\\" Reno Evening Gazette, Reno, Nevada, November 11, 1966. In 1972 Kenneth became staff artist and art history course coordinator for International Exchange School in Salt Lake City. He prepared their art course syllabus. He conducted several art studio workshops aboard cruise ships on the Mediterranean Sea. He was asked by the Greek Epirotiki Cruise Line to teach art aboard the T.S.S. Hermes. He also taught art classes aboard the Regina Prima and on the Romanza cruise ships. In addition, he conducted art workshops at the Collegio Alla Querce and other college campuses in Europe. Furthermore, his art appreciation tours to the Queen Mary College of South Woodford, England, attracted several students. During these years of European travel he also served on the Board of Directors for the House of Fine Arts, Provo, Utah.Curtis Enterprises Inc., \\"Special Bicentennial Salute,\\" Mountainwest Magazine, Provo, Utah, November 1976, vol. 2, no. 8, advertisement insert, p. 22. Kenneth’s art encompassed a striking range of canvas sizes – from minute images of cellular amoeba to enormous murals, including a 12 x 90 foot mural of Lake Tahoe for a marine dealership. And he painted a great variety of subjects, including still-life, architecture, character renditions, and wildlife. But it was his free-flowing Western mountain scenes and powerful seascapes that captured the attention of scores of collectors.

Reverend Robert Loughridge and his wife, Olivia, bought an empty cabin for ten dollars and began teaching. He named the mission \\"Koweta\\". History For a time the Creeks resisted mission work and schools, even outlawing Christianity and preaching. But in 1843, Rev. Robert Loughridge was granted permission to open the Koweta Mission, primarily because Creek leaders recognized a need for education for their children. The Koweta Mission was well received by Creek families who sent their children to study there. Rev. Loughridge wrote in a letter to the white Creek agent, Colonel James Logan, which described the beginning of his work with the Creek people: \\"Although the old chief at first had a manifested some fears of our religious influence interfering with their old customs, yet he gave us a cordial welcome, and requested me to locate the mission in his town. This I did and called the station Koweta, after the name of his home town. It was situated about 24 miles northwest of Fort Gibson, and one and one-half miles east of the Arkansas River. There was on the place selected a vacant Indian cabin 14x24 feet, with a dirt floor and covered with clapboards. Connected with it was a small unfenced field and a few fruit trees. For the whole premises, I paid the owner ten dollars. As planks could not be hauled a great distance, I had hired some men to split out 'luncheons' and floor the house. In this little cabin we lived happily for more than a year, and in this cabin our first child was born. As by agreement I could only preach at the Mission station. My first object was to build a log house to answer the double purpose of school and church. As soon therefore as it was ready for use, my wife commenced teaching a school of fifteen or twenty children, and the neighbors were invited to attendance at the Mission, while the most of them were devotedly attached to their old customs and superstitions. The outlook was very discouraging.\\" The school operated for about 3 months until sickness and a lack of inadequate accommodations caused the school to be closed temporarily. After a while Rev. Loughridge started to overcome Indian objections and more and more Creeks began to attend his services. Loughridge's wife Olivia gave birth to her second child on September 5, 1845, unfortunately the nearest physician who lived in Fort Gibson was not in the area. Olivia died of puerperal fever on September 17, at the age of twenty-nine. One year later on September 26, 1846 the child died and was buried next to Olivia. Creek officials granted permission for a second school to be built called Tullahassee Mission. It was located 16 miles east of Koweta Mission and 10 miles west of Fort Gibson, it was completed in 1859. The Rev. and Mrs. William Robertson were in charge of this boarding school.Lee, Victoria. \\"Coweta Oklahoma The first 100 years\\" (2004). Retrieved on 2008-01-08. The Koweta Mission was abandoned and then burned during the Civil War. Other schools and churches that had been built were also abandoned among all the tribes. Most of their children had received at least a few years of education. Sadly, the war disrupted the mission work forcing most of the ministers and teachers to leave Indian Territory for the duration of the conflict. Olivia and her child are buried in the Bruner Family Cemetery on the Hopping Farm a mile and a half southeast of Coweta. Today the site is marked only by a cemetery.

The editor-in-chief is Piero Capelli (Ca' Foscari University of Venice). The journal is published by Morcelliana (Brescia, Italy).  Name  The ancient patriarch Enoch is the hero and patron because Enoch is an inter-canonical, interdisciplinary character par excellence and as such requires an inter- canonical, interdisciplinary approach by specialists of both Judaic and Christian Studies. Enoch is the symbol of the determination to go beyond the traditional boundaries that divide the field of research of ancient and medieval Judaism and Christianity.  Organization  The journal is jointly edited by an international board of directors, assisted by an editorial board and by an international advisory board. It is double-blind peer-reviewed and indexed in the main international academic databases for the Humanities, Religious Studies, and Social Sciences.  History  The journal was established in 1979 by Paolo Sacchi ( University of Turin). The interests of the journal ranged from the Bible to contemporary Judaic studies, already with a clear emphasis on ancient Judaism, including Christian origins. From 1979 to 1986 the journal was published by Marietti (Casale Monferrato, then Genoa, Italy). In 1987 the journal moved to another publisher, Silvio Zamorani editore (Turin, Italy). From 1989 to 1995 Bruno Chiesa (University of Pavia, then University of Turin) was the Editor-in-Chief; he was succeeded by Claudio Gianotto (University of Turin) from 1996 to 2004. In 2005 the journal moved to a new publisher, Morcelliana (Brescia, Italy), starting its 2nd series with the new subtitle \\"Studies in Judaism and Christianity from Second Temple to Late Antiquity\\" and shifting its focus from the broader field of Judaic Studies to the period following the Babylonian exile up to the rise of Islam. Gabriele Boccaccini (University of Michigan) was appointed as the new editor- in-chief. In 2012 the journal started its 3rd series with the subtitle \\"Historical and Textual Studies in Ancient and Medieval Judaism and Christianity\\", publishing on the history of Judaism broadly conceived, inclusive of the Second Temple, rabbinic and medieval periods, Christian origins and Jewish-Christian relations until the Early Modern Age, with priority given to studies that advance the discipline of textual criticism.

Its goal is to promote the Klingon language and culture.  General  The KLI has members from all over the world.KLI Throughout the World For 13 years, it published a quarterly journal \`HolQeD\` (Klingon for linguistics), before discontinuing the paper mailings and changing to an electronic version which quickly stopped entirely. It also published the fiction and poetry magazine \`jatmey\`. Each year, the KLI hosts a five-day conference called \`qepʼaʼ\` (Klingon for \\"great meeting\\"), which is open to both members and anyone interested in the language.Annual qepʼaʼ information At this conference, an annual $500 scholarship is bestowed upon an undergraduate or graduate linguistics student. The KLI is running several projects, including the translation into Klingon of the Bible and works by Shakespeare. The motto of the institute is \`qoʼmey poSmoH Hol\`, which means \\"Language opens worlds\\". The KLI is a nonprofit corporation and exists to facilitate the scholarly exploration of the Klingon language and culture. It has the permission of CBS Studios to use trademarks such as Star Trek and Klingon.  History  The KLI was founded in 1992 in Flourtown, Pennsylvania. Each year in midsummer, the annual meeting named \`qepʼaʼ\` takes place. It is open to anyone who is interested in the Klingon language, and usually takes place in the United States. The eighth meeting, the first and only ever outside the USA, was held in Brussels (Belgium) in 2001 and organized by Lieven Litaer. At these meetings, attendees talk about Klingon and in Klingon in a school-like style, with lessons, lectures and exercises. It is usually at a professional level and cannot be compared to a standard science fiction convention. Parallel to this annual meeting, many members of the KLI also organize their own \\"small meetings\\", in Klingon called \`qepHom\`, which are informal and local small gatherings to practice the Klingon language. At the \`qepʼaʼ\` of the year 2003, a documentary movie about the KLI was produced. Its name is Earthlings: Ugly Bags of Mostly Water. This movie was presented at the Cannes Film Festival in France, and was shown at theaters few years after.  Organization  The director of the KLI is its founder Lawrence M. Schoen, Ph.D. At intervals ranging from three to eighteen months, a Beginners' Grammarian is elected among the most experienced speakers. His duty is to help teach the beginners of the Klingon language, especially in the Klingon email discussion group, which is also accessible for non-members. When his duty is over, he keeps his title of Grammarian. The KLI has about 20 of those former Beginners' Grammarians. The KLI is in close contact with Marc Okrand, the creator of the Klingon language, who has visited each \`qepʼaʼ\` since the third one. At this occasion, he receives a wishlist of requests for missing Klingon vocabulary, which he frequently answers. These new words are first published in \`HolQeD\`, and then on the KLI's website.  Notable speakers  Some Klingonists have gained relative notoriety for various accomplishments. The KLI can award the title Friend of Maltz to a Klingonist who has furthered the language in various ways. = Rich Yampell = Rich Yampell (known to Klingonists as \`HoD Qanqor \` or \\"Captain Krankor\\"), a software engineer currently residing in Bellevue, Washington, is probably the world's first ever conversational speaker of Klingon.

At the time of Speers' attempt, Klingon even lacked words for many objects common around the house, such as \\"table\\". The experiment ultimately failed when the child refused to use Klingon when he got older,Gavin Edwards: Babble On Revisited, Wired Magazine, Issue 7.08, August 1999 and Speers abandoned the project in 1997. = Lawrence M.

It is north-west of Bridgwater, and north-east of Williton. It is on the coast of Bridgwater Bay on the Bristol Channel, near the Hinkley Point nuclear power stations. History It was recorded as Lytel-Stoke or Lulestock in the Domesday book, and rendered at one time as Little Stock or Little-stoke. Its name is said to have meant \\"the stoc [farm] of Lylla and his people\\". Lilstock was an ancient parish, part of the Williton and Freemanners Hundred. In 1811 of common land were enclosed as part of the Inclosure Acts. Lilstock became a civil parish in 1866, but in 1886 it was merged with Kilton to form the civil parish of Kilton with Lilstock, itself abolished in 1933 and absorbed into the parish of Stringston. Coast Wave-cut ridges on the beach The Blue Anchor to Lilstock Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) provides an outstanding series of sections through the Early Jurassic Lower Lias, spanning the Hettangian and Pliensbachian stages and named the \\"Lilstock Formation\\". This sequence and the good Rhaetian succession beneath are repeatedly affected by faulting, making it of interest to geologists and fossil hunters. It also displays coastal geomorphology which demonstrates a particularly well- developed series of intertidal shore platforms varying in width from about 200–600 m. The cliff and beach are rich in reptile remains, including complete skeletons. Lilstock also yields ammonites, shells and fish remains. A unique specimen of an ichthyosaur, named Excalibosaurus costini MacGowan, in which the lower jaw is shorter than the upper, was found in the Lower Jurassic Sinemurian Stage, Lower Lias beds on the foreshore at Lilstock and is now in the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery. Harbour Lilstock appears to have been the old port of the Saxon settlement of Stogursey. The Acland baronets were the lords of the manor. Around 1820 Sir John Acland built a boat house on the beach with a pier and breakwater to form Lilstock harbour. Coal was brought from Wales for domestic use on the Acland estate, and to fire the large limekiln on the cliff. Pit props were the main export along with lime. By 1848 there were resident coastguards, and by 1855 a customs officer. About 1860 a stone pier was built from the north side of the harbour wall. By 1866 warehouses were standing beneath the cliff beside the southern harbour wall. The limestone carrier the Richard was wrecked at Lilstock in 1881. A plan for a ship canal from Seaton in Devon to terminate at Lilstock was considered by the Board of Admiralty in 1888. The harbour was apparently abandoned following damage during a storm on the night of 28/29 December 1900, and the pier finally being destroyed after the First World War. Gunnery range Royal Navy Aircraft Range, Lilstock. It is used as a lookout during gunnery practice over the sea. The sea off Lilstock has been used as an air gunnery practice range connected to RNAS Yeovilton, and ordinance presumed to date to the Second World War has been found offshore. Lilstock Royal Navy Range served as a practice bombing range for fixed-wing aircraft using inert ordnance until 1995, when it was redesignated as a helicopter gunnery range. Church St Andrew's Church The small Church of St Andrew, with only two rows of pews, features a 14th-century chancel arch. This arch is the only remaining portion of the earlier church which was demolished in 1881 when the present structure was erected. The church was declared redundant in 1980, and the Norman font removed to Stogursey Church in 1981. The church was restored around 1993 but only holds one service a year. The most recent baptism in the church was in 1881 and the most recent wedding was in 1834.

Nakai–Nam Theun NBCA covers approximately 3,445 km2 of the Annamite Range and the adjacent Nakai Plateau in Khammouane and Bolikhamxay Provinces. The reserve headquarters is in Nakai, the administrative centre of Nakai District. Rivers From north to south, riversheds in the conservation area consist of those of the following rivers: *Nam Kata (eastern part only; the Nam Houay, on which the town of Na Kadok is located, is a tributary) *Nam Xot *Nam Mon *Nam Theun *Nam Noy *Nam Pheo (a tributary of the Nam Noy) *Nam One All are tributaries of the Nam Theun to the southwest in the Nakai Plateau. Habitat A series of surveys conducted since 1994 by the co-operative programme of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), the Lao Department of Forestry, and the World Conservation Union (IUCN) have revealed that the area has a high biodiversity conservation value. Semi-evergreen forest, deciduous dipterocarp forest and stands of pine are all found on the Nakai Plateau and in the Annamite foothills to the east, grading into more exclusively evergreen forests as the land rises towards the Vietnamese border. Higher still, huge areas of montane fagaceous forest cloak the slopes, interspersed with patches of Fokienia hodginsii, a commercially valuable cypress-like conifer. On mountaintops and above c. 2,000 m the fagaceous forest gives way to more stunted, rhododendron- dominated ericaceous cloudforest. Flora Species of plants listed as threatened by IUCN include conifer Cephalotaxus mannii. The only known population of Vietnamese White Pine in Laos is in Nakai–Nam Theun. Fauna =Mammals= Species of mammals, some discovered relatively recently, include the following: *Saola *Giant muntjac *Roosevelt's muntjac *Truong Son muntjac *Indo-chinese warty pig *Heude's pig *Annamite striped rabbit *Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticus) *Indochinese tiger *Asian elephant =Birds= More than 400 bird species have been identified in Nakai–Nam Theun and the adjacent northern extension. This is by far the highest avian species richness of any site yet surveyed in Laos and is the highest recorded in a single protected area in Southeast Asia. Languages Many endangered Vietic languages are spoken in the Nakai–Nam Theun Conservation Area. The Vietic peoples are the indigenous peoples of the Nakai–Nam Theun area, and have deep knowledge of the local ecology. The Saek language, which preserves many archaic phonological features not found in any other Tai language, is also spoken in the area, often alongside Vietic languages in the same villages. Saek speakers had lived in the area for about 300 years, and had originally come from Vietnam. Bru speakers had moved to the area in the 1800s and 1900s, and now make up the majority of the population. Lao and Vietnamese speakers, most of whom are recent migrants, are also found in the area.

History  Tetford is listed as \\"Tesforde\\" in the Domesday Book, with a mill, probably on the site of the present 17th-century watermill near the centre of the village. The parish contains traces of ancient encampments thought to be from Saxon times. It is reputed to be the site where Raengeires, a Briton, defeated the Saxon general Horsa in a great battle. In 1841 the parish was noted for its fertiliser production made from burnt limestone. The Edward Richardson Community Primary School was founded through a 1714 bequest from Edward Richardson of a cottage and about of land towards teaching the poor children of Tetford and Salmonby. In 1821 a National School was built and enlarged in 1897 and 1899. For many years Tetford was the home of Methodist preacher Charles Richardson, known as the 'Lincolnshire Thrasher'. Richardson was an uneducated farm labourer who late in life discovered a gift for evangelistic preaching and was invited to preach throughout England. He was inspired by a 'time of refreshing' at Tetford starting at Christmas 1826 when a chapel congregation enjoyed a service 'like a little Pentecost' which continued until 3am. After this they went to Mr Riggall's house and 'such a baptism of the Holy Spirit was bestowed upon him as he had never received before.'J E Coulson, 'The Peasant Preacher', London, 1865 A biography of Richardson, 'The Peasant Preacher', went through at least four editions. The White Hart Inn, parts of which date from the 16th century, was once the meeting place of the Tetford Club for local gentry, whose members included Tennyson from nearby Somersby. 2007 flooding During the 2007 United Kingdom floods the village was affected with East Road and West Road being flooded, causing the north of the village to be cut off from the south. Governance An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches south west to Mareham on the Hill with a total population at the 2011 Census of 2,196.  Geography  Tetford is situated in the Lincolnshire Wolds, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, running from Louth in the north, to Horncastle in the south. The village is north-east from Horncastle, south from Louth and north-west from Spilsby. It is in a shallow valley, at the bottom of a 98 m (320 feet) high ridge on which runs the Bluestone Heath Road. The parish covers about . The Prime Meridian passes just to the east of Tetford. Community Village amenities include the Edward Richardson Community Primary School, the White Hart Inn public house, and a doctor's surgery. = Church = Tyso Boswell and Edward Hearn (or Heron) double grave at Tetford A place of worship has stood on the site of the Church of St Mary for over 900 years. The present building erected in the 14th century is built of local greenstone and had a tower added in the 15th century. Outside the north-east of the chancel is a headstone to two gypsies, Tyso Boswell and Edward Hearn, killed by lightning on the eve of Horncastle Fair in 1831.

The first of Walton's published novels, it is also the first of three \\"Sulien\\" novels. It was followed in 2001 by a sequel, The King's Name, and in 2002 by a prequel, The Prize in the Game. The novels are a reinterpretation of the story of King Arthur. Plot summary Sulien ap Gwien, a woman warrior and daughter of the King of a small part of the island of Tir Tanagiri, is brutally raped by six invading Jarnsmen and her brother is murdered. While travelling to the capital to request help from Urdo, the High King, she happens upon a battle between some more Jarnsmen and some of the King's soldiers. Sulien proves her skill in battle and, drawn in part by the young King's leadership and charisma, she enlists in the cavalry. The novel follows her journey up the ranks, the battles against the invading Jarnsmen and Isarnagans, and Urdo's efforts to unite the many kingdoms of Tir Tanagiri and restore peace and law to the land.

There he wrote his book called: Descriptio Terrae Sanctae or \\"Description of the Holy Land\\" which is considered to be of \\"extraordinary importance\\". Descriptio Terrae Sanctae It is the most detailed account of the Holy Land from the thirteenth century. It is described as having belonged to a class of its own among medieval descriptions of the Holy Land. Approximately 100 medieval and early modern manuscripts are known today, some of which include maps and diagrams.Baumgärtner, Ingrid. \\"Burchard of Mount Sion and the Holy Land,\\" Peregrinations: Journal of Medieval Art and Architecture 4, 1 (2013): 5-41. : \\"Its various versions, including a short and a long version in Latin and translations into German and French, have been handed down in approximately one hundred medieval and early modern manuscripts and some early printed books of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Burchard’s description, although little studied even today, is considered a key document that influenced the perception of Palestine in travel accounts and maps until far into the sixteenth century. Some of the manuscripts and later prints of Burchard’s text are accompanied by graphical work, including regional maps, diagrams, miniatures, and city plans.\\" Burchard was in Palestine for 10 years between 1274 and 1284. He then visited Armenia where he wrote about the court of the king of Cilician Armenia, Levon II. Burchard described the country of Cilician Armenia as submitted to Mongol domination,\\"He starts by explaining that the country was \\"submitted to the domination of the Mongols\\"\\", in Mutafian, p.66 and explains that Mongols were present at the royal Armenian court: Having completed his business there, Burchard sailed to Cyprus, where, he tells us, he was kindly received by Henry II of Jerusalem the last ruling and full titular King of Jerusalem (after the fall of Acre on 28 May 1291, this title became empty) and also ruled as King of Cyprus. Burchard also wrote a plan for a Crusade, in which he recommended the conquest of Orthodox Serbia and Constantinople as pre-requisites to the accomplishment of a Crusade. His plan is said to have been rather impractical, and to have displayed a dislike of Orthodox Christians, more than of Muslims themselves.Ruciman, p.440 In 1455 Philip the Good Duke of Burgundy ordered his secretary, Jean Mielot, canon of Lille and miniaturist to translate the Descriptio Terrae Sanctae, by Burchard of Mount Sion (1283). The translation was embellished by him with beautiful miniatures of Jerusalem copies of which are held in Bibliothèque nationale de France, Royal Library of Belgium and the Bodleian Library, Oxford. For Burchard's Jerusalem, the map of Jerusalem by Marino Sanudo in his Liber Secretorum Fidelium Crucis. An English translation of the original longer manuscript is provided in Denys Pringle's collection of translated pilgrimage texts part of the Crusade Texts in Translation series published by Ashgate. Burchard is one of the last pilgrims to travel to the Holy Land and write a full report before the fall of the Latin Kingdom in 1291. According to Jaroslav Folda the account is important not only because of its systematic and yet selective content, but also because of the extent of the actualia included in his discussion.

Function  The AP-2 alpha protein acts as a sequence- specific DNA-binding transcription factor recognizing and binding to the specific DNA sequence and recruiting transcription machinery. Its binding site is a GC-rich sequence that is present in the cis-regulatory regions of several viral and cellular genes. AP2-alpha is a 52-kD retinoic acid-inducible and developmentally regulated activator of transcription that binds to a consensus DNA-binding sequence GCCNNNGGC in the SV40 and metallothionein promoters. AP-2 alpha is expressed in neural crest cell lineages with the highest levels of expression corresponding to early neural crest cells, suggesting that AP-2 alpha plays a role in their differentiation and development. Transcription factor AP-2 alpha is expressed in ectoderm and in neural-crest cells migrating from the cranial folds during closure of the neural tube in the mouse. Cranial neural crest cell provides patterning information for craniofacial morphogenesis and generate most of the skull bones and the cranial ganglia. AP-2 alpha knockout mice die perinatally with cranio-abdominoschisis and severe dysmorphogenesis of the face, skull, sensory organs, and cranial ganglia. Homozygous knockout mice also have neural tube defects followed by craniofacial and body wall abnormalities. In vivo gene delivery of AP-2 alpha suppressed spontaneous intestinal polyps in the Apc(Min/+) mouse. AP-2 alpha also functions as a master regulator of multiple transcription factors in the mouse liver. In melanocytic cells TFAP2A gene expression may be regulated by MITF.  Clinical significance  Mutations in the TFAP2A gene cause Branchio- oculo-facial syndrome often with a midline cleft lip.Dixon MJ, Marazita ML, Beaty TH, Murray JC (2011). \\"Cleft lip and palate: understanding genetic and environmental influences\\". Nature Reviews Genetics (12): 167-178. In a family with branchio-oculo-facial syndrome (BOFS), a 3.2-Mb deletion at chromosome 6p24.3 was detected. Sequencing of candidate genes in that region in 4 additional unrelated BOFS patients revealed 4 different de novo missense mutations in the exons 4 and 5 of the TFAP2A gene. A disruption of an AP-2 alpha binding site in an IRF6 enhancer is associated with cleft lip. Mutations in IRF6 gene cause Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) that is a rare mendelian clefting autossomal dominant disorder with lower lip pits in 85% of affected individuals. The remaining 15% of individuals with Van der Woude syndrome show only cleft lip and/or cleft palate (CL/P) and are clinically indistinguishable from the common non syndromic CL/P. NSCL/P occur in approximately 1/700 live births and is one of the most common form of congenital abnormalities. A previous association study between SNPs in and around IRF6 and NSCL/P have shown significant results in different populations and was independently replicated. A search of NSCL/P cases for potential regulatory elements for IRF6 gene was made aligning genomic sequences to a 500 Kb region encompassing IRF6 from 17 vertebrate species. Human sequence as reference and searched for multispecies conserved sequences (MCSs). Regions contained in introns 5’ and 3’ flanking IRF6 were screened by direct sequencing for potential causative variants in 184 NSCL/P cases. The rare allele of the SNP rs642961 showed a significant association with cleft lip cases. Analysis of transcription factor binding site analysis showed that the risk allele disrupt a binding site for AP-2 alpha. Mutations in the AP-2 alpha gene also cause branchio-oculo-facial syndrome, which has overlapping features with Van der Woude syndrome such as orofacial clefting and occasional lip pits what make rs642961 a good candidate for an etiological variant. These findings show that IRF6 and AP-2 alpha are in the same developmental pathway and identify a variant in a regulatory region that contributes substantially to a common complex disorder.

Rise to top Wei Shifang had a highly unusual rise to his position. As of 694, Wu Zetian was said to be attracted to the teaching of three individuals involved in mystic teachings. The first was an old Buddhist nun from Henei (河內, in modern Jiaozuo, Henan), who was staying at Linzhi Temple () in the capital Luoyang, who self-claimed the title of \\"Pure Light Rulai (Tathagata) Buddha\\" () and claimed to be able to predict the future. The second was Wei, who was an associate of the old nun, and who was from Mount Song, who claimed to be born in 238, during the reign of the emperor Sun Quan of Eastern Wu—which would make him 456 years old at the time. The third was a non-Han old man who claimed to be 500 years old and who had met Wu Zetian's lover Huaiyi 200 years earlier. Wu Zetian respected them greatly and bestowed the imperial clan name of Wu on Wei Shifang. In fall 694, she even made him Zhengjian Daifu (), a senior consultant at the examination bureau of government (鸞臺, Luantai) and gave him the designation of Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi (), making him a chancellor de facto. On the edict giving him these offices, she emphasized that he was more impressive than even Lord Guangcheng () of Yellow Emperor's time who claimed to have lived for 1,200 years, and Duke Heshang () of Emperor Wen of Han's time who claimed to have written commentaries for the Tao Te Ching for more than 1,700 years. Less than a month later, Wei requested that he be allowed to return to Mount Song. Wu Zetian relieved him of his posts and escorted him back to Mount Song. Change in attitude In 695, however, Wu Zetian's attitude to these individuals changed, in light of a fire that Huaiyi set to the imperial meeting hall (明堂, Mingtang) in jealousy over her having a new lover, the imperial physician Shen Nanqiu (). Slightly earlier, Wei had claimed that he would be capable of creating medicine that would allow people to live forever, and Wu Zetian sent him to take governmental wagons to the Lingnan region to look for material for the medicine. After the fire, the old nun—who was said to pretend to follow Buddhist teachings on vegetarianism but instead was secretly feasting on pigs and goats, and who had also kept a staff of 100 young and immoral nuns as her disciples—went to see Wu Zetian. Wu Zetian rebuked her and said, \\"You claimed that you could predict the future, so why could you not predict the fire?\\" Wu Zetian had the nun escorted back to Henei, and her disciples and the old non-Han man both fled. Immorality reports Subsequent to their flight, there were reports of immorality on their part, and Wu Zetian, in order to trap them, summoned the old nun back to Linzhi Temple. Her disciples returned, and Wu Zetian had the eunuch in charge of palace security make a surprise trip to Linzhi Temple, arresting all of the young nuns and making them government servants. Meanwhile, Wei was returning from his trip to Lingnan, and had reached Yanshi (偃師, near Luoyang) when he heard what had happened, and he committed suicide by hanging.

History Tia River Station was first settled by Richard and William Denne in 1840, then comprising an area of . It was later purchased by Augustus Hooke in 1882. It was on this station that Blue Spec, a brown stallion foaled in 1899, was bred and who later won the Kalgoorlie Cup, Perth Cup and the 1905 Melbourne Cup in record time.Binney, Keith R., Horsemen of the First Frontier (1788-1900) and the Serpents Legacy, Volcanic Productions, Sydney, 2005, In 1893 the Tia Receiving Office was opened and later became a Post Office in 1901 and closed in 1977. The school has also been closed for quite a few years. The church still remains on the Tia Diggings Road. In 1895 the following description of Tia appeared in the Uralla and Walcha Times: \\"Tia is situated about 25 miles from Walcha, on the Port Macquarie road or Oxley Highway, and may aptly be called a thorough poor man's fossicking ground, first on account of its accessibility and known auriferous character, and secondly on account of the low cost at which the necessities of life can be obtained.\\" =Gold= The first gold mining activity was recorded at Tia in 1866. In 1873 a reef was discovered at McLeod’s Creek, when a rush occurred. In 1877 two Scotsmen, Matheson and Mclntyre spent considerable effort tunnelling and digging shafts. In 1879 they erected a machine for crushing rock and constructed a race half a mile long to bring water to work the machine. After yields slightly over an ounce to the ton they sold out in 1887 to the Tia Gold Mining Company, which deepened shafts, and spent money on their operations, but with poor results. Large scale mining petered out, although fossicking continued for some years to come. Geography The Tia River flows over Tia Falls and through the Tia Gorge which are part of the Oxley Wild Rivers National Park are typical New England Tablelands country and can be accessed by a six kilometre gravel access road off the Oxley Highway.

He was then made a professor Philosophy, and two years later, Theology. in 1753, the presented the school with a country house at Equerchin, which became a school for younger students. Talbot returned to England in 1755. At the age of thirty-three, he was appointed the Coadjutor bishop to Dr Richard Challoner, on 10 March 1759. On the same day, Talbot was appointed Titular Bishop of Birtha, and consecrated to the Episcopate by Bishop Challoner in Hammersmith on 24 August 1759. During his episcopate he was twice brought to trial, on the information lodged by the well-known informer William Payne, in 1769 and 1771 respectively. In each case he was acquitted for lack of evidence, but the judge, Lord Mansfield, was seen as being on Talbot's side, in consequence of which, although he was no friend to Roman Catholics in general, his London house was sacked during the Gordon Riots of 1780. =Apostolic Vicar= On the death of Bishop Challoner in 1781, Talbot became Vicar Apostolic of the London District, which he ruled for nine years. There were seven chapels in London, and being illegal, four were located in foreign embassies: Portuguese, Neapolitan, Bavaria, and Sardinia. A fifth chapel in Moorfields was designated a \\"warehouse\\". Moorfields was the site of some of the most violent rioting during the Gordon Riots. Bishop Talbot rebuilt the damaged and destroyed chapels with charitable contributions from Spain. The London district included ten counties, besides the Channel Islands and the British possessions in America—chiefly Maryland and Pennsylvania and some West Indian islands. The closest bishop was in Quebec. In 1783, Talbot refused to grant faculties to preach and hear confessions to two priests returning to America, claiming he no longer had jurisdiction.

During the last years of his life the Catholic Committee was already threatening trouble. In order to control it, Bishop Talbot allowed himself to be elected a member; but it was soon evident that the laymen were beyond the control of the hierarchy. The crisis however had not yet arrived when in 1790 Talbot died at his house at Hammersmith. Bishop Talbot was buried in the cemetery of the parish church in Hammersmith. In 1901 his body was moved to Mortuary Lane at Old Hall, which leads to the St. Edmund's College Chapel. Legacy One of the houses at St. Edmund's College is named in honor of James Talbot.

Built in 1936, it is the official residence in Romania of Margareta of Romania, her husband Prince Radu, and her sister Princess Maria. The Palace was designed in 1930 by the architect Duiliu Marcu and built in 1936 for Princess Elisabeth, the daughter of King Ferdinand I and his wife Queen Marie, and also the aunt of King Michael I, who was forced to abdicate on 30 December 1947. In 2001, the Romanian Senate passed a bill which states that the Palace would be awarded to the former king for use as a residence during his lifetime.http://www.rferl.mobi/a/1059599.html Since then, members of the former Royal Family have been living there. Foreign heads of state, royalty and politicians are received there, as well as Romanian political, cultural, economic and academic figures when special events are conducted.http://www.familiaregala.ro/resedinte/palatul-elisabeta History In July 1935, Princess Elisabeth, former Queen Consort of Greece, divorced her second cousin, the deposed King George II of Greece. After her divorce, she moved to Romania, where she stayed at Banloc Castle. In 1930, the plans for Elisabeta Palace were made by Romanian architect Duiliu Marcu, who had designed Victoria Palace as well as many other buildings, but all building plans were brought to a halt in the early 1930s due to the Great Depression. Construction finally started in 1936, with the edifice inaugurated in December 1937. For Elisabeth, the Palace was the achievement of a long elusive dream, heightened during the dearth years spent in Greece. In her memoirs, she wrote: \\"Perhaps the only thing that I really want is a house of my own something that I can call mine. It has always been my greatest longing since the age of 17. My house to create, to improve, to make perfect and love, offering hospitality to and rejoicing with all those who would love it too. I think the possession of a house would really make me happy. I lived on that hope when I came back to Romania\\". The Palace was the official residence of Princess Elisabeth until 1944, when King Michael I performed his coup and overthrew the Nazi-supporting government. After the coup, he left Royal Palace of Bucharest, the official royal residence of the King of Romania, and moved into Elisabeta Palace with his mother to be directly in the centre of the capital; Princess Elisabeth had moved to Copăceni Castle. On the evening of 30 December 1947, King Michael abdicated. Much later, he claimed that he was forced to do it at gunpoint, with the Palace surrounded by troops from the Tudor Vladimirescu Division, an army unit loyal to the Communists.https://web.archive.org/web/20091027123236/http://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/lobby/8957/960510.html Following King Michael's abdication and throughout the period of the \\"Socialist Republic of Romania\\", the Palace fell into disuse until 2001, when the former Royal Family returned to Romania after nearly five decades of exile. At that time, they were given official use of the Palace by a bill signed by Traian Băsescu, 4th President of Romania, and approved by the Romanian Senate.http://www.rferl.mobi/a/1059599.html Image gallery File:Plaque Elisabeta Palace monument.jpgThe trilingual plaque at the main gate, briefly tells the story of the building.

Format Tekzilla was a viewer question, review, and technology news show, a mix between The Screen Savers and Call for Help (and featuring some of the same on-air talent as those shows). Each show began with a brief rundown of that episode's segments followed by an overview of the sponsors. After a short title sequence the hosts introduced themselves and talked about events that happened to them and events that were coming up, before moving onto questions. It became a common trait of the show to have special guests answer specialist questions for which the hosts were unable to provide answers.

However, PA Serafina was quoted on the forums for saying, \\"There's details and red tape we still need to figure out. I'll keep you updated\\".Live taping of Tekzilla – Page 17 In more recent episodes viewers were urged to upload video questions on YouTube; building on this Roger Chang mentioned during one of the 2008 live shows that he thought having live Skype calls would be a good addition to the show.

It was produced by Platinum Productions and published by Ocean Software for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and Commodore 64.Rambo at worldofspectrum.com The Commodore 64 version's music is by Martin Galway from Northern Ireland, incorporating melodies from the film's score. The Amstrad CPC version's music was played and recorded live by Choice Software's in-house programmer/designer/musician James Edward Cosby also from Northern Ireland, using a Yamaha DX7 synthesiser via the then new MIDI serial comms protocol. Several other games based on the film were also released, including Rambo for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and Rambo: First Blood Part II for the Sega Master System. Gameplay Screenshot from the Commodore 64 version. The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, and follows the movie's story. The player, controlling Rambo, has to find his lost equipment, locate the POW camp, rescue the hostages and make it back to the extraction point, while being pursued by constantly respawning enemies. Rambo starts off with just a Bowie knife and grenades (both of which have an unlimited supply, as with all the weapons), and gains points for killing the enemy, and for collecting the following equipment: Rocket Launcher, M16 Rifle, and Bow & Arrows (Explosive & Non Explosive). The game was one of the first to feature controllable vehicles (a helicopter), and also one of the first to feature stealth elements. Most of its gameplay style is strikingly similar to that of Ikari Warriors (although the Sega Master System version is well known for its same concept), but the levels are not as repetitive. Reception and related releases Rambo was well received. Your Sinclair described it as \\"a thinking man's Commando. That game starts fast and gets faster until you end up like a one-man whirlwind. Rambo develops into a solid shoot'em up\\". Rambo went to number 2 in the UK sales charts, behind Winter Games. The Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum versions of the game was included on the 1986 compilation They Sold a Million 3, along with Fighter Pilot, Ghostbusters, and Kung-Fu Master. As of 2008, there is a remake available for the PC, with enhanced graphics, sound and music taken from the film's theatrical score. Gameplay remains unchanged. Another difference is that the enemies are more plentiful than the original.

The ethos of the Company is to provide access to all to Shakespeare's work without any prior knowledge of the play or author, and the Artistic Director has made it a Company policy to avoid unnecessary theatrical artifice and special effects. To that end the plays are performed without staging or elaborate lighting and the action takes place in and around the space in which the audience sits. The centrepiece of any production is, therefore, the language - thus returning to Shakespeare's original mode of communication with his audience.

Geography Thorpe Arnold is situated on the top of a hill to the north-east of the town of Melton Mowbray. Nearby major cities include Leicester, Birmingham, and Sheffield. In 1870–72, John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described Thorpe Arnold as follows: History Arms of de Bois: Argent, two bars and a canton gules, as depicted by Matthew Paris and in the de Bois Hours The first recorded mention of Thorpe (Torp) is in the Domesday Book of 1086, as one of the numerous manors held by Hugh de Grandmesnil, Sheriff of Leicestershire and Governor of Hampshire, who was richly rewarded by William the Conqueror for his part in the Norman Conquest of England. From the 12th century, Thorp is known as Thorp Arnold, having taken the first name of its new owner, Arnold (or Ernauld, Latinised to Hernaldus) de Bois (French: \\"from the wood/forest\\") (Latinised to de Bosco (\\"from the wood/forest\\")), a vassal of the Earl of Leicester. His successors also used the first name Arnold. The death of Hernaldus de Bosco (Arnold de Bois) in 1255, a Warden of the Forest, is recorded by Matthew Paris in his Historia Anglorum (1250-1259), folio 170 verso.http://www.vikinganswerlady.com/Stars/Historia_Angelorum.htm His arms were Argent, two bars and a canton gules. Arnold I de Bois and his son Arnold II de Bois took an active part in the political life of England and Normandy. Arnold II supported Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester and was rewarded by the earl with a grant of numerous manors in Leicestershire (including Thorpe Arnold, Brentingby, Evington, Humberstone and Elmesthorpe) and in Warwickshire (Clifton-on-Dunsmoor and Shrewley). The \\"de Bois\\" Book of Hours made at Oxford in 1325/30 for Hawise de Bois survives in the Pierpont Morgan Library in New York (MS-M700).http://ica.themorgan.org/manuscript/page/55/133201 In the 17th century, Thorp Arnold was owned by sir Martin Lister, English politician, whose stepdaughter Frances Thornhurst lately became the mother of Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough.

The monologue is a description of a college football game, as seen by a naive country preacher who attends the game by accident and is entirely puzzled by it. Production According to radio host Dr. Demento, \\"What It Was, Was Football\\" was originally an old vaudeville routine that Griffith, who claimed to have improvised the routine shortly before its first performance, \\"may have heard ... and subconsciously drawn inspiration from\\". At Griffith's request, Milton Alderfer (who was only 19 at the time), recorded and produced the original master tape in Greensboro, North Carolina.\\"Winning Game\\" The Greensboro Record 16 Dec. 1953 C6 The master was then sent to Chapel Hill, North Carolina and mass-produced by the Colonial Records label in late 1953. Soon, after Colonial had sold nearly 50,000 copies of the record, Capitol Records took over distribution and ultimately sold nearly 800,000 copies. It also shot into the Top 10 in the Billboard record charts, peaking at #9 in February 1954. \\"What It Was...\\" (which remains one of the biggest-selling comedy records of all time) was instrumental in launching Griffith's career in television, stage, and film. On the original single, the monologue is credited to \\"Deacon Andy Griffith.\\" Griffith made an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1954, in large part due to the popularity of the record. \\"What It Was, Was Football\\" was printed in Mad magazine in 1958, with illustrations by artist George Woodbridge. Most of the text of the recording is printed verbatim with faithful renderings of Griffith's accent as heard on the recording; however, Griffith's original climactic description of \\"the awfullest fight that I have ever seen...in my life!\\" is moved to an earlier position in the printed version. Also, while the original recording makes no direct reference to a specific university as a setting for the game witnessed, the illustrations in the Mad version refer to both the Ivy League and University of Notre Dame. Due to licensing issues, this adaptation had to be omitted from the Totally MAD CD-ROM collection of the magazine's run. In 1987, Andy Griffith made an appearance on The Tonight Show. During the interview, guest host Bill Cosby told Griffith that he had purchased Griffith's recording of \\"What It Was, Was Football.\\" Cosby then told Griffith that he had performed it at school and received an A for his grade, much to Griffith's surprise and delight. In 1997, the monologue was made into a short film.

Plot  The plot centres on infamous criminal George McCabe, who is imprisoned following a botched diamond heist, and a struggling actor named Lawrence Nixon – both of whom are played by Dreyfus. In his TV reconstruction of the robbery, Nixon, who bears a strong resemblance to McCabe, livens up his portrayal of the criminal by giving him a lisp and a camp walk. McCabe is rendered a laughing stock in prison as a result, and decides to exact his revenge on Nixon by arranging to escape, then for Nixon to take his place in jail. However, neither man can predict the life-changing consequences that McCabe's actions will have.  Production  The prison set used in the film was the same one used for the television series Bad Girls, though it was repainted.

It lies 4 miles to the north of Melton Mowbray at the southern end of the Vale of Belvoir. In the 2011 census the parish (including Thorpe Arnold and Wycomb) had a population of 608. The name of the village is derived from Old English and originally meant shallow ford. It has retained its current spelling for at least 440 years, being shown as 'Scalford' on the map of Warwickshire and Leicestershire produced (in Latin) in 1576 by Christopher Saxton as part of his Atlas of England and Wales. Churches Scalford parish church of St Egelwin In addition to Scalford village, the civil parish includes two hamlets, Wycomb and Chadwell. The latter has a tiny Church of England church, St Mary's, which was damaged in the 17th century and is now restored in a smaller form. The Scalford parish church, which is on a small hill in the centre of the village, is named after St Egelwin the Martyr (alias St Ethelwin) and is believed to be the only one in the country named after this saint. A Grade II* listed building, it was built circa 1100 AD. It has been refurbished internally in 2014 to include a kitchen and toilet area with the original pews having been cleaned and restored; the old tile floor has been uncovered, cleaned and repaired; new under-pew, under-floor and radiator heating has been installed together with new up- and spot-lighting. The church is again used for services, the nearest alternative places of C of E worship being the churches in Chadwell and Waltham on the Wolds. The Vicar is responsible for a number of other parishes in addition to Scalford. The church hosts weddings, Christenings and funerals. The village hall is available for after event meetings or receptions (contact Andy Wade on 01664 444229 to arrange) as is the local Kings Arms pub. The church is also available as a public space for choral and music recitals, art exhibitions, or non-religious gatherings. The Scalford Methodist Church, built in 1844 and recently redecorated throughout, has its own minister, is very active and is currently the only place of weekly Christian worship in Scalford. It is a very picturesque setting for weddings as all the internal pine pews, organ, fixtures and furniture are still in place. It serves an area extending into the Vale of Belvoir and has members from Eastwell to the north, Waltham on the Wolds to the east, Ab Kettleby to the west, and Melton Mowbray to the south. It hosts a preschool group ' every term-time morning, has a luncheon club monthly on Fridays and regular activities in addition to its 10.45a.m. Sunday morning services, some 4.00pm. services and other special services for festivals. It is unusual in that it has a garden and its own cemetery. It also hosts choir rehearsal sessions, the Women's Institute meetings and from time to time Scout and Guide weekends. There are war graves at the chapel and also at the church which also has a fine war memorial to the first and second world wars. Fund raising takes place also at the Village Hall. Amenities Like many villages, Scalford has lost a number of industries and amenities over the years. There used to be a dairy which produced Stilton cheese, three bakers, a blacksmith, stonemasons, builders, a shoemender, a range of shops (one incorporating the post office), a garage and a second pub, The Plough, all now gone. There were also flourishing brickyards around 1875 to 1930 and bricks with the Scalford imprint burned in can still be found. The master's house remains and is called Lion House after the company name. Currently (2017) there is one public house and restaurant in the village, the Kings Arms, along with a school and a post office (in a kitchen) which also sells a limited range of groceries. There is also a garden centre and landscape developer. This local company has won gold awards for garden design at the nationally recognised competition at the Sandringham Estate, Norfolk since 2008. New housing in recent years being restricted to in-fill and a small development on the site of the old stilton cheese factory and dairy. There is a modern village hall surrounded by a playing field, which hosts a range of community activities. In addition to the established farming community, the village is home to many professionals who work in Leicester, Nottingham and even further afield. In the past decade there have been a number of recipients of MBEs for services to the community, sport and geological study. In times gone by, the village was entirely surrounded by a triangle of railways. Scalford station was on the GNR and LNWR Joint Line from Market Harborough to Bottesford, while a number of mineral lines, attracted by the iron-ore mining which used to take place in this part of the Vale of Belvoir, completed the triangle. A book, Railways of Leicestershire and Rutland, by David Webb (2007), illustrated by the Mason brothers, [Ian Allan, ] shows the lines and pictures of the locomotives. Before 1939 the lines were often used for transporting horses to local races and point to point meetings. Regular passenger services ended in 1953 but the lines survived for freight and summer specials until final closure came in 1962. Some of the railway infrastructure still exists in the form of various cuttings and embankments, which have largely become incorporated into the countryside but leaving in place a few bridges and footpaths. Scalford is situated on the Jubilee Way footpath from Melton Mowbray to Belvoir Castle, and a 'stop off' for walkers between Melton and the Vale of Belvoir. Scalford can be reached from Melton or the Vale by regular buses, and there is more than adequate parking at the village hall, which is overseen by nearby houses. There are quiet roads suitable for cycling, and for the children 'Twinlakes', a fun park with very good resources for children of school age since no adult is admitted without a child. Nearby villages which should be visited are Waltham on the Wolds, Eastwell, Goadby Marwood, Holwell and Thorpe Arnold. Scalford hall, on the outskirts of the village, is an Edwardian mansion house which is now an 88-room hotel and wedding venue. In the 1940s it was the home of Colonel Colman, of the Colman's mustard company. The Colonel was a friend of the Prince of Wales, later King Edward VIII, and throughout their much publicised courtship, Edward and American divorcee Wallis Simpson regularly stayed at Scalford Hall. Colonel Colman died in the hunting field as he might have wished but his late wife is still remembered by older people in the village.

The water drops about 120 m. Tad Lo, Bolaven Plateau, Laos Logging truck on the Bolaven Plateau, southern Laos. June 2009 Coffee processing on the Bolaven Plateau The Bolaven Plateau is an elevated region in southern Laos. Most of the plateau is located within Champasak Province of Laos, though the edges of the plateau are also located in Salavan, Sekong and Attapeu Provinces. It is located between the Annamite Mountain Range, along which runs Laos' eastern border with Vietnam, and the Mekong River to the west, at about . The plateau's elevation ranges approximately from above sea level. The plateau is crossed by several rivers and has many scenic waterfalls. The name Bolaven makes reference to the Laven ethnic group which has historically dominated the region. However, domestic migrations by the Lao ethnic group (which comprises approximately 50 to 60 percent of the population of Laos) has resulted in widespread interethnic marriage, thus modifying the ethnic composition of the region. Historical significance The Bolaven Plateau has had an important role in the greater history of Laos. The three most significant historical periods which have greatly affected the area are the French colonization of the region, the Phu Mi Bun Revolt, and the Vietnam War. Each event has had a significant effect upon the Plateau and given the area its own unique character and importance. =French colonization= In 1893, the French first annexed territories east of the Mekong River and later annexed minor extensions of land to the west of the Mekong in 1904 and 1907.Fox-Stuart, Martin (Winter 1995). \\"The French in Laos, 1887–1945\\". Modern Asian Studies. 29:1 p. 111. . For the Bolaven Plateau, the period of French colonization in Laos is most significant because of the agricultural techniques acquired from the French by the inhabitants. According to the Historical Dictionary, \\"the French planted coffee and experimented with rubber, and the plateau has remained an important agricultural area growing a wide variety of fruit and vegetables, as well as cash crops\\".Stuart-Fox, Martin (2001). Historical Dictionary of Laos. Second Edition. Asian/Oceanian Historical Dictionaries Series No. 35. Maryland: The Scarecrow Press. It was not until the French introduced farming to the region in the early 20th century that the residents of the Bolaven Plateau made the area an agricultural sector. The second period that helps define the history of the Plateau is the Phu Mi Bun Revolt. The revolt erupted in 1901 and was not suppressed until 1907. It was a “major rebellion by local Lao Theung tribes (the Alak, Nyaheun and Laven) against French domination\\". Though there is not extensive literature on these particular revolutionary revolts in the Bolaven Plateau, one can see that the native communities desired to rid the region of the extensive and overpowering influence of their colonizers. =The Vietnam War= The Bolaven Plateau greatly suffered during the Vietnam War. The Bolaven Plateau was one of “the most heavily-bombed theatres of the Second Indochina War, US bombardment became unbearable in the late ’60s. Controlling the Bolaven Plateau was considered strategically vital to both the Americans and North Vietnamese, as evidenced by the staggering amount of UXO (unexploded ordnance) still lying around”.Lonely Planet. 2009. “Introducing Bolaven Plateau.” URL: http://www.lonelyplanet.com/laos/southern-laos/bolaven-plateau Since there is a great deal of UXO lying around the Plateau, it is often dangerous to veer off unmarked paths. According to many accounts, the devastation caused by these bombings can still be seen in some areas, though most edifices have been rebuilt. In addition, the mere fact that the Plateau is one of the areas passed through on the Ho Chi Minh Trail (The trail does not pass through the plateau but, rather, just off the east edge of the plateau. During the war the plateau was accessible by vehicle via Paksong and Thateng and those roads were the only roads that led off the plateau.) still attracts tourists and brings further attention to the region.Legend of the, Ho Chi Minh trail  Laos GPS Map Thus, the three aforementioned events are unique historical incidents which have directly affected the Bolaven Plateau. Culture The predominant ethnic group in the Bolaven Plateau is the Laven, though other Mon-Khmer ethnic groups reside in the area including the Alak, Katu, Taoy, and Suay. According to CPA Media, \\"all of these people follow animist belief systems\\" with some groups practicing animal sacrifices. However, more recently, some of these minority communities have begun to adopt Buddhist beliefs because of their contact with Lao Loum.Fox-Stuart, Martin (2008). Historical Dictionary of Laos. Third Edition. Asian/Oceanian Historical Dictionaries Series No. 68. USA: The Scarecrow Press. Economy Literature on the Bolaven Plateau often focuses on two primary economic contributors to the region: agricultural production and tourism. Both contribute greatly to the Plateau’s revenue. The French first began farming and other agricultural techniques in the Bolaven Plateau including the production of coffee, rubber, and bananas in the early 20th century. Since the French's initial influence, \\"the plateau remained an important agricultural area growing a wide variety of fruit and vegetables, as well as cash crops such as cardamom\\". However, it was the French introduction of the production of coffee that has proved most useful to the region. During colonization, the French introduced the production of “high quality stock of both Arabica and Robusta strains. Production declined during the war years, but is now experiencing a renaissance”.CPA Media: The Asia Experts. 2009. \\"From Champasak to the Bolaven Plateau.\\" URL: The climate of the Plateau with its cooler temperatures and abundant rainfall makes it the perfect place for coffee production. Most farming families that make up a variety of the aforementioned minority groups are highly dependent on the coffee industry as their source of income. Coffee in Laos is \\"cultivated almost exclusively on the Bolaven Plateau in Champasak Province in the southern part of the country... Currently, the Lao coffee harvest generates about 15–20,000 tons a year, 80% of which is Robusta.\\" Tourism Tourism has taken a hold in the Bolaven Plateau because of the unique aspects of the region that have triggered great intrigue. The most popular places visited by tourists are the waterfalls in the region, the villages of the ethnic minorities, and other geopolitical areas of interest. The Bolaven Province has a number of waterfalls. The Tad Lo Waterfalls that are approximately 58 miles from northeast Pakse are a common destination. The \\"lush vegetation\\" that surrounds the waterfall makes it a desired destination though the fall itself \\"drops only a few meters\\". In addition, one can go \\"beyond Paksong on the way to Pakse [where] another spectacular waterfall, Taat Fang (also known as Dong Hua Sao), tumbles 120 metres, making it the tallest waterfall in Laos.

London 1851 was the first international chess tournament.Byrne, Robert. \\"Chess\\", The New York Times, January 14, 1997. Accessed July 21, 2008. \\"Indeed, it was not until the International Tournament of 1851, held at the Crystal Palace of the London Exhibition, that tournament play entered the chess scene.\\" The tournament was conceived and organised by English player Howard Staunton, and marked the first time that the best chess players in Europe would meet in a single event. Adolf Anderssen of Germany won the sixteen-player tournament, earning him the status of the best player in the world. Background and objectives The front entrance of the Great Exhibition In May 1851, London staged the Great Exhibition to showcase British industry and technology, and London's thriving chess community felt obliged to do something similar for chess. Howard Staunton proposed and then took the lead in organizing the first ever international tournament, to be held at the same time. and He thought the Great Exhibition presented a unique opportunity because the difficulties that obstructed international participation would be greatly reduced, for example it would be easier for contestants to obtain passports and leave from work. This can be viewed online at or downloaded as PDF from In 1848 a letter had been published in which Ludwig Bledow proposed that he and von der Lasa should organize in Trier (Germany) an international tournament whose winner should be recognized as the world champion (Bledow died in 1846; it is not known why publication was delayed). News of this may also have motivated Staunton to organize the London International tournament. Staunton and his colleagues had ambitious objectives for this tournament, including convening a \\"Chess Parliament\\" to: complete the standardization of the moves and other rules, as there were still very small national differences and a few self-contradictions; to standardize chess notation; to agree time limits, as many players were notorious for simply \\"out-sitting\\" opponents. Staunton also proposed the production of a compendium showing what was known about chess openings, preferably as a table. Since he thought there would not be time for a single \\"Chess Parliament\\" session to handle this as well, he suggested further congresses, some perhaps including knowledgeable enthusiasts of below top-class playing strength, and a review process for dealing with contentious issues and possible mistakes in earlier decisions. Before the tournament started two commentators wrote that the winner should be regarded as \\"the World’s Chess Champion\\"; one was Captain Hugh Alexander Kennedy, one of the tournament's organizers and competitors, while the other was the Liberty Weekly Tribune in Missouri. However, there is no indication that crowning a world champion was a formal objective of the tournament. Preparation The Committee of Management was under the leadership of the Duke of Marlborough, but Staunton was its Secretary and most of its members were from Staunton's chess club, St George's. Rivalries in British chess at that time led the powerful London Chess Club to boycott the competition, and George Walker used his column in Bell's Life to try to disrupt the tournament preparations. Despite these obstacles, Staunton raised £500 for the prize fund, a considerable sum in 1851, and worth about £359,000 in 2006's money.Conversion based on average incomes, which are the most appropriate measure for several days' hard work. If we use average prices for the conversion, the result is about £40,000: Subscriptions were obtained from chess clubs in England and overseas. From France, collections were made at the Café de la Régence, and from India, the Calcutta Chess Club contributed £100, and in addition its principal officers John Cochrane and T.C. Morton made two of the four largest personal contributions. The tournament was scheduled to coincide with The Great Exhibition in London, and began on 26 May 1851. Players The tournament was planned as a knock-out contest involving sixteen of Europe's best players. Invitations had been extended to foreign masters Vincent Grimm, József Szén, and Johann Löwenthal from Hungary; Adolf Anderssen, Bernhard Horwitz, Carl Mayet, and von der Lasa from Germany; Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant and Lionel Kieseritzky from France, and Carl Jaenisch, Alexander Petrov and Ilya Shumov from Russia. The British players were to be Howard Staunton, Henry Thomas Buckle, Marmaduke Wyvill, Elijah Williams, Captain Hugh Alexander Kennedy, Samuel Newham, and Henry Bird. Unfortunately many of the invitees were unable to play. Grimm was unable to attend as he was exiled in Aleppo after his participation in the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. Löwenthal had also participated in the failed revolt but fled to America, where he established himself in business. Löwenthal left his affairs behind to travel to London to play. Saint-Amant was unavailable as he had been sent by the French government to California as a diplomat following its independence from Mexico during the California Gold Rush. Von der Lasa and Petrov were also unable to attend. Jaenisch and Shumov could not arrive in time to play. Jaenisch arrived in London late, and played a post-tournament match with Staunton that Staunton won +7−2=1. Buckle also did not make the tournament, and as he was generally considered second only to Staunton among British players, he was the strongest British player missing. The dispute with the London Chess Club prevented Daniel Harrwitz from playing, and also weakened the pool of substitutes available, as George Walker, George Perigal, and George Webb Medley could have made for a stronger field if not for the boycott. Anderssen was reluctant to accept his invitation, as he was deterred by the travel costs. However Staunton offered to pay Anderssen's travel expenses out of his own pocket if necessary, should Anderssen fail to win a tournament prize; Anderssen accepted this generous offer. As part of the project the London International Tournament's committee also organized a \\"London Provincial Tournament\\" for British players who were not strong enough to be invited to play in the International Tournament. The committee \\"promoted\\" E.S. Kennedy, Edward Löwe, James R. Mucklow, and Alfred Brodie to play in the International Tournament rather than the Provincial Tournament, in order to obtain the number of players required for a knock-out tournament. Tournament The tournament was organised as single elimination matches, with the eight losers in the first round being dropped from the tournament. Each first-round match was a best-of-three games, draws not counting. Subsequent rounds were best-of-seven, and losers played consolation matches. The pairings were made by chance, i.e. there was no seeding system of the type commonly used in tennis tournaments. Three of the stronger players, Kieseritzky, Bird, and Löwenthal all lost in the first round. On the other hand, two of the replacement players, J. R. Mucklow and E. S. Kennedy, were drawn against each other; the winner (Mucklow) thus gained a share of the prize money. Anderssen beat Staunton soundly, 4–1 in the third-round semi- final. In the fourth-round final Anderssen beat Wyvill to take first place. Wyvill had had a relatively easy draw in the tournament to finish second. Staunton suffered a bitter defeat to Williams in the last round consolation match to finish a disappointing fourth. Aftermath Howard Staunton Despite the obvious flaws in the knockout format of the tournament, the outcome was just as Anderssen was the best player. As provided by the rules of the tournament, Staunton immediately challenged Anderssen to a twenty-one-game match for a £100 stake. Anderssen agreed to the match, but could not play right away as he had been away from Germany and his job as a school teacher for over two months. In addition Staunton was physically unfit for an immediate contest. The proposed match was never played. As a result of winning this tournament Anderssen was popularly recognised as Europe's best player, although as far as is known he was never described as \\"world champion\\". The idea of a world chess champion had been current at least since 1840, (Jeremy Spinrad believes the author was George Walker) and the earliest known use of the term \\"world champion\\" is in 1845, referring to Staunton and published in Staunton's Chess Players' Chronicle. Wilhelm Steinitz was widely recognized as \\"world champion\\" in the 1870s, but the first formal contest for the world title was the 1886 match between Steinitz and Johannes Zukertort. Staunton wrote the tournament book, which he titled The Chess Tournament (1852). Although an excellent description of the event, it was marred by ill grace with which he received Anderssen's victory. Staunton's description of Anderssen as Germany's second-best player after Anderssen won the 1851 International tournament may have been reasonable, however, on the basis of what is now known about von der Lasa's skill, and Anderssen's playing strength had surged in the months preceding the tournament, as a result of training matches against strong players in Germany. Staunton blamed his poor showing on the strain of his duties in organising the tournament, and also thought that he suffered from a weak heart since an illness in 1844. He condemned the pursuit of chess as a profession, writing > Chess never was, and while society exists, never can be a profession. It may > to a great extent strengthen the mind of the professional man, but it must > never become the object of his life. It is because its true character has > been lost sight of by the zealous or the mercenary, that victory at any cost > has become a more important object than the advancement of the science. At least in part, this was the complaint of an ungracious loser, as most of Staunton's income was derived from his skill at chess. By this time Staunton was also a successful scholar with a long-term contract to produce editions of Shakespeare's plays. Staunton was also concerned with the lack of time limits on play. After some experimentation, time controls would become standard in all serious tournaments some years later. The weakness of the knockout format, a kind of hybrid between match and tournament play, was eliminated by adopting the round-robin format beginning with the London 1862 tournament. The famous Immortal Game, Anderssen–Kieseritzky, London 1851, was played as an offhand game during a break in this tournament. It was not one of the games of their first-round match. The London Chess Club, which had fallen out with Staunton and his colleagues, organized a tournament that was played a month later and had a multi-national set of players (many of whom had competed in the International tournament), and the result was the same - Anderssen won. Strength of the competition Staunton is generally regarded as having been the leading world player from 1843 until this tournament, due to his 1843 match victory against Pierre Charles Fournier de Saint-Amant. As this was the first ever international tournament, it is difficult to assess the strengths of the players in earlier events. According to Chessmetrics, five of the top eight players in the world were present: Kieseritzky (1), Williams (3), Löwenthal (4), Anderssen (6) and Mayet (8); and the highest ranked player not present was Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa, who had won a match against Anderssen earlier in 1851.Chessmetrics Player Profile: Tassilo von der Lasa During the tournament, Anderssen won matches against both Kieseritzky and Staunton.

The headline act was the English rock band Led Zeppelin, who performed their first full-length concert for almost three decades, since the death of drummer John Bonham in 1980, in a one-off reunion. Bonham's son Jason Bonham played drums during the band's set, and also provided backing vocals on two songs. According to Guinness World Records 2009, the concert holds the world record for the \\"Highest Demand for Tickets for One Music Concert\\" as 20 million requests for the reunion show were rendered online. In October 2012, Celebration Day, a concert film documenting the event, was released. Both the film and performance by Led Zeppelin have been highly acclaimed. A shortened version of the concert was broadcast by the BBC in the UK on 8 December 2012. Background On September 12, 2007, it was confirmed during a press conference by promoter Harvey Goldsmith that the surviving members of Led Zeppelin would reunite for the show, with Jason Bonham filling in on drums. The concert was originally scheduled to take place on November 26, 2007. It was to help raise money for the Ahmet Ertegun Education Fund, which pays for university scholarships in the UK, US and Turkey. Tickets were made available via a lottery system through the website Ahmettribute.com, costing £125 / $250, with all proceeds going to Ahmet's own charity. The website exceeded its bandwidth allowance and crashed almost immediately following the announcement, with the promoter predicting that the gig would cause the \\"largest demand for one show in history\\". The promoter claimed that one million people registered for fewer than 20,000 available tickets. Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page later commented: On November 1, 2007, it was announced that Page fractured the little finger on his left hand after a fall in his garden and the reunion show was postponed to December 10, 2007. The concert =Opening acts= The show opened with a band consisting of Keith Emerson, Chris Squire, Alan White and Simon Kirke] with the brass section from Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings. They played Emerson, Lake & Palmer's version of \\"Fanfare for the Common Man\\", including sections from Yes' \\"The Fish\\" and Led Zeppelin's \\"Kashmir\\". Initially the openers should have been Squire, White and Rick Wakeman but Wakeman was unavailable for the rescheduled date due to prior commitments and Emerson was called in as a last-minute replacement. The show also featured Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings, Paul Rodgers, Paolo Nutini, and Foreigner as supporting acts. The majority of the performance was by the Rhythm Kings, with Nutini and Rodgers both guesting on two songs each. The performance billed as \\"Foreigner\\" was in fact only Mick Jones performing \\"I Want to Know What Love Is\\" with St. Lukes C of E secondary school as the choir and former Foreigner drummer Brian Tichy and the Rhythm Kings as the backing band. Other guests on the Rhythm Kings set included Maggie Bell and Alvin Lee. Pete Townshend was scheduled to perform as a supporting act, but he pulled out when he heard Led Zeppelin was performing, saying, \\"They really don't need me.\\" Other acts considered for the show included a reunited Cream. =Led Zeppelin= The band performed 16 songs—including two encores—from across their career, excluding their final studio album, In Through the Out Door. \\"We were asked to play a forty-minute set,\\" Jimmy Page remarked during rehearsals. \\"And we soon realised we couldn't. If we go out and play 'No Quarter', 'Moby Dick' and 'Dazed and Confused' with all the solos, you're already talking over an hour. We've gone from seventy-five minutes to ninety, to the best part of two hours. There's no way I can take on playing three-and-a-half-hour sets now, flying against the winds and the storms, because I just don't have that energy anymore. But I've still got enough to get me through a two-hour set. Coming back to Led Zeppelin's music after all these years, the challenge is to post as much of it as we can. And the question is, Which ones can we actually play?\\" Two numbers were played live in their entirety for the first time ever by Led Zeppelin: \\"Ramble On\\" and \\"For Your Life\\". During rehearsals, John Paul Jones commented, \\"'For Your Life' feels good, mainly because we've never played it much. It all feels quite fresh to me because I haven't played any of this stuff for years and I never listen to the records at home… Jason (Bonham) makes it more interesting too, because he's not trying to reassemble things exactly the way his father did.\\" Without Bonham, said Robert Plant, \\"it would've been a totally different thing because his enthusiasm and points of reference were spectacular – his knowledge of shows that had been performed when he was a tot.\\" =Setlist= #\\"Good Times Bad Times\\" #\\"Ramble On\\" #\\"Black Dog\\" #\\"In My Time of Dying\\"/\\"Honey Bee\\" #\\"For Your Life\\" #\\"Trampled Under Foot\\" #\\"Nobody's Fault but Mine\\" #\\"No Quarter\\" #\\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" #\\"Dazed and Confused\\" #\\"Stairway to Heaven\\" #\\"The Song Remains the Same\\" #\\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" #\\"Kashmir\\" First Encore: # * \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" Second Encore: # * \\"Rock and Roll\\" The concert sound was mixed by Metallica's FOH engineer Big Mick. In 2012 an album and film were released as Celebration Day. The concert was also recorded by many fans. Sophisticated bootleg versions of the show are available on the Internet, including a wide-screen DVD with a surround sound audio track mixed from 10 different audience recordings of the show. The historic concert attracted nearly 20 million fans from all corners of the globe. Because of the enormous demand for tickets, an online lottery system was implemented in which fans entered a random drawing. Eight thousand fans were selected and allowed to purchase the 16,000 tickets that were made available to the public. To combat fears of ticket scalping, lottery winners had to be present in London with ID to pick up their tickets and wristbands for entry. Hundreds of fans with General Admission tickets arrived at the O2 Arena days in advance with the hopes of being front and center for such a landmark occasion. As the concert was expected to be Led Zeppelin's last, a number of celebrities attended the gig, including Joe Elliott, Chad Smith, Dave Grohl, BBC Radio 1 DJs Chris Moyles & Fearne Cotton, Mark Butler, Brett Hull, Chris Evans, Bob Harris, Ilan Rubin, Paul McCartney, Jeff Beck, Brian May, David Gilmour, Lulu, Oasis brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher, Ann Wilson, Arctic Monkeys, The Edge, Bernard Sumner, Dave Mustaine, Peter Gabriel, John Squire, Mick Jagger, Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, Matt Morgan, Juliette Lewis, James Dean Bradfield, Richard Hammond, Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Ashcroft, Marilyn Manson, Warren Haynes, Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, David Boreanaz, W.

He also reflected that \\"It’s great that we did it. I look back on that night with a great amount of fondness, but Jason [Bonham] was the hero. For me that gig was about him.\\" Plant has stated: In an interview he gave to The Times in January 2010, Page recalled: \\"There was a Zeppelin swagger, definitely,\\" Jones says drily. \\"We knew we were good.

He has released two studio albums, recorded extensively, and toured the world. Music career In 1977, Hunt graduated from Brazoswood High School in Clute, Texas. He then attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, where he graduated in 1980. Later, Hunt returned to Berklee, where he is an instructor in the piano department. While recording and performing in the Boston area with his Berklee contemporaries Randy Roos and Tiger Okoshi, Hunt also performed with Peter Calo's bands Bellvista, and Thin Ice. During 1985, he toured with fusion drummer Billy Cobham. From late 1985 to 1987, he served as musical director for the Jazz Explosion. Here, he led a trio which backed up one or more important artists on tours. The trio consisted of Hunt, bassist Jimmy Earl, and Victor Jones on drums. The artists included: Gato Barbieri, Angela Bofill, Tom Browne, Stanley Clarke, the late George Duke, Kenny G, Freddy Hubbard, Ramsey Lewis, Noel Pointer, Stanley Turrentine, and the late Phyllis Hyman. The Jazz Explosion performed in the Kennedy Center in Washington, the Circle Star Theater in San Francisco, the Beacon Theatre in New York, the Universal Theater in Los Angeles, and Hammersmith Odeon in London. In 1987, Hunt left the Jazz Explosion to go, with Earl and drummer Gerry Brown, on a tour of Europe led by fusion bassist Stanley Clarke and guitarist Allan Holdsworth. In 1988, he recorded on Clarke's album If This Bass Could Only Talk, and in 1993, on East River Drive, where he is credited with helping to compose the song \\"I'm Home Africa\\". From 1987 to 2003, Hunt performed, toured, and recorded as a member of Allan Holdsworth's band. Several of his compositions appear on Holdsworth's albums. On Secrets (1989), Hunt is credited with composing \\"Maid Marion\\", and \\"Joshua\\". On Wardenclyffe Tower (1992), he did \\"Dodgy Boat\\". On Hard Hat Area, he helped to write \\"Prelude\\" and \\"Postlude\\". On the album Then!, which was recorded live in Japan, he helped with \\"Zone I\\", \\"Zone II\\", and \\"Zone III\\". Tracks from these albums are included in the compilation The Best of Allan Holdsworth: Against the Clock. In 1997, percussionist Gregg Bendian recorded on Hunt's album From Your Heart and Soul, which also featured a performance by Holdsworth. This began a relationship in which Hunt recorded on four of Bendian's albums. Two of these, Trio Pianissimo and Change, are studio albums with Bendian's Trio Pianissimo, and two are part of Bendian's Mahavishnu Project, which is his tribute to John McLaughlin. In Chelmsford, Massachusetts, Hunt runs a record company, Spice Rack Records, which is closely associated with The Kitchen Recording Studio. These companies created both Hunt's first album, mentioned above, and in 2007, his second, Live at the PCA. In other releases, Hunt serves not only as producer, arranger, or engineer, but also as a performer. The label has recorded works by guitarist David Hines (2 albums), his wife, pianist Pamela Hines (5 albums), and bassist Christian Fabian (2 albums). Eight more single releases are by: Auditory Implant, Robert Badoglio, Peter Fedele, Isha, Lucas Pickford, Lewis Robinson, Ed Spargo, and Nicole Storm. Hunt has recorded extensively as a guest artist. An example is Peter Janson's album Beautiful Day, on which Hunt is credited with helping to compose the songs \\"December Morning Sun\\", \\"Dragonfly\\", and \\"Beautiful Day\\". When he is not busy in The Kitchen, Hunt performs locally and on tour. Occasionally, he also performs in festivals and at conventions.

Around 1300, he finished a castle in Münsterberg. When he died in 1301, his possessions were divided among his three sons. The youngest son, Bolko II Ziębicki, received Münsterberg (Ziębice) in 1321 and was the first to style himself Duke of Münsterberg (Duke of Ziębice). He resided in the town's castle. After he demanded land from the diocese's domains, a long-running dispute with the Bishop of Breslau arose, and the bishop imposed an interdict over the duchy several times, while the duke was anathematized. After the siege of Frankenstein by the Moravian Margrave and later by Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV, Bolko II recognized Bohemian suzerainty on 29 August 1336 in the Treaty of Straubing. Bolko II died in 1341; he was buried in the church of the Heinrichau (Henryków) monastery, a monastery he generously supported during his lifetime. George of Münsterberg-Oels Bolko's son, Nicholas the Small, was Duke of Münsterberg until 1358. In the year of his father's death, he paid homage to Bohemian King John of Luxembourg and his son Charles. Nicholas' successor, Bolko III, died in 1410. The next dukes, the brothers Henry († 1420) and Jan, ruled the duchy together until 1420; afterward Jan ruled alone. Jan died on 27 December 1428 at the Battle of Altwilmsdorf against the Hussites. With him the Piast Dukes of Münsterberg died out. Bohemian rule With the death of Duke Jan, the duchy passed to Bohemian King Sigismund, who pledged it to Půta III of Častolovice, Lord of Častolovice, in 1429. After Půta III's death in 1434, his widow, Anna of Koldice, kept the bond and ruling claims. However, the estates of Münsterberg favored Countess Euphemia of Oettingen, a niece of the last duke. She gained Münsterberg in 1435, but abandoned it a year later because of continuing disputes. Although Anna of Koldice sold her possessions in 1440 to Hynek Krušina of Lichtenburg, whom she married shortly thereafter, new succession disputes with the estates erupted, in which several Silesian princes supported the estates of Münsterberg. In 1442, Hynek Krušina looted the Heinrichau monastery, since it was particularly associated with the estates. After lengthy negotiations, the estates of Münsterberg on 25 April 1443 chose Duke Vilém of Opava as their new ruler. His claims were justified by two reasons. First, he was the son of Přemysl of Opava of the Přemyslid dynasty and Catherine, the sister of Jan of Ziębice († 1428), the last duke of Münsterberg of the Piast dynasty. Second, he was married to Salome, a daughter of the late Půta III. Vilém joined forces with the Bishop of Wroclaw and the Silesian princes, who fought against Hynek Krušina. Although Hynek Krušina had not legally abandoned his claims, the dispute was settled in 1444. Münsterberg around 1750 After Vilém's death in 1452, the duchy passed to his brother Arnošt, who sold it in 1456 to Bohemian King George of Poděbrady. The King handed his possessions down to his sons Victor, Henry the Elder and Henry the Younger in 1472. Henry the Elder, who was married to Ursula of Brandenburg, a daughter of Elector Albrecht III of Brandenburg, received the Duchy of Münsterberg. He also got Frankenstein (Ząbkowice Śląskie), the County of Kladsko, the dominion of Náchod, and the former east Bohemian possessions of Půta III. In 1488, he built a castle in Münsterberg and in 1495 obtained the duchy of Oels. He resided in Kladsko (Glatz, Kłodzko), where he died in 1498. He was succeeded by his sons Albert, George and Charles, who ruled together. The latter moved his residence to Frankenstein in 1530, where he died six years later and was buried in the parish church. His sons, Joachim, Henry, John and George, supporters of the Reformation, ruled jointly until 1542. In the same year, they pledged the indebted duchy to their uncle, Duke Frederick II of Legnica († 1547). In 1551, Bohemian King Ferdinand I redeemed the duchy from Duke Frederick III of Legnica. Between 1552 and 1559 it belonged to Queen Isabella of Hungary as a pledged lordship. In 1559, the duchy passed into the hands of Duke John of Oels, a son of Charles I of Münsterberg, and thus returned to the house of Poděbrady. After John's successor, Charles Christopher, died childless in 1569, Münsterberg reverted to the crown of Bohemia. Because of his contributions to the House of Habsburg, King Ferdinand III in 1654 gave the duchy to a Prince of the Holy Roman Empire, Count Johann Weikhard of Auersperg. Prussian rule After the First Silesian War and the incorporation of Silesia into Prussia in 1742, the Auerspergs retained their possessions. The duchy however was converted into a State country. In 1791, Prince Charles Joseph Anton of Auersperg sold the duchy to Prussian King Frederick William II.

Early life  Gopabandhu Das was born on 9 October 1877 in Suando village, near Puri in what was then called Orissa. His mother was Swarnamayee Devi, the third wife of Daitari Das. His father was a mukhtiar and the family were reasonably well-off. Das married Apti at the age of twelve but continued his education. He had basic schooling in the village before progressing to a middle school nearby. Then, in 1893, by which time his mother had died, Das joined Puri Zilla School. There he was influenced by Mukhtiar Ramchandra Das, a teacher who was both a nationalist and a proponent of public service in aid of people in distress. Becoming adept at organising his fellow children in the spirit of co-operation, the inadequate response of authorities for the victims of an outbreak of cholera prompted him to start a voluntary corps called Puri Seva Samiti. Its members helped those suffering from the outbreak and also cremated the dead. Das, whose father by now had died, progressed to Ravenshaw College in Cuttack. He became a regular contributor to local literary magazines called Indradhanu and Bijuli, where he argued that any modern literary movement, just like any modern nation, could not be a clean break with the old but rather had to acknowledge and base itself on its past. In one instance, he submitted a satirical poem that so enraged the Inspector of Schools that Das was punished when he refused to apologise for it. It was while at Ravenshaw that Das started a discussion group, called Kartavya Bodhini Samiti (Duty Awakening Society), in which he and his friends considered social, economic and political problems. It was also during this time, in 1903, that he attended a meeting of the Utkal Sammilani (Utkal Union Conference), where he disagreed with Madhusudan Das's suggestion that Odia- speaking areas should be amalgamated with Bengal Presidency. These extra- curricular activities, which also included helping the victims of flooding, impacted on his academic studies such that he failed his degree examination, although he gained his BA at the second attempt. It was also while at Ravenshaw that his new-born son died; he explained his preference to deal with flood victims on that occasion rather than be with his sick son as being because \\"There are so many to look after my son. What more can I do? But there are so many people crying for help in the affected areas and it is my duty to go there. Lord Jagannath is here to take care of the boy\\". Das progressed to Calcutta University, where he obtained an MA and LL.B while simultaneously devoting much of his energies in attempts to improve the education of Oriya people who were living in the city, for whom he opened night schools. His desire to bring about social reform and educational improvements was influenced at this time by the philosophy of the Swadeshi movement. His wife died on the day he heard that he had passed his law examinations. Now aged 28, all of his three sons had died and he chose to give up care of his two daughters to an older brother, along with his share of property in Suando.  Legal career  Das arrived at his first job as a teacher in Nilagiri in Balasore district of Orissa. He then became a lawyer, variously described as being based in Puri and in Cuttack. In 1909, Madhusudan Das appointed him to be State Pleader for the princely state of Mayurbhanj.  Education work  Sculpture of Gopabandhu Das at State Museum, Bhubaneswar Finding that law did not interest him, Das gave up his practice and worked for the welfare of the people. In 1909, Das established a school at Sakhigopal, near Puri. Popularly known as Satyabadi Bana Bidyalaya (Now Satyabadi High School, Sakhigoal) but called the Universal Education League by Das, it was inspired by the Deccan Education Society, operated in the gurukula tradition and aimed to impart a liberal education on a non-sectarian basis, despite opposition from orthodox Brahmins. He believed education was necessary if people were to become aware of their both of their innate freedom and their duty to their country. He thought that education could help the child to grow mentally, physically and spiritually. His system allowed children of all castes and backgrounds to sit together, dine together and study together. The school had features like residential schooling, teaching in a natural setting and cordial relationship between the teacher and the taught. Das laid emphasis on co-curricular activities and wanted to generate nationalistic feelings in students through education and teach them the value of service to mankind. Hugely motivated by the positive response he received, the school was converted into a high school in the following year. It secured affiliation from Calcutta University and held its first matriculation exam in 1914. The school further secured an affiliation from Patna University in 1917. It became a National School in 1921. The school faced financial problems and ultimately was closed in 1926. Das had not taught much at the school due to pressures on his time elsewhere but he did act unofficially as its manager. He also attempted to raise funds for it, guide its curriculum and attract pupils.  Political career and imprisonment  Madhusudan Das encouraged Gopabandhu Das to stand for election to the Legislative Council that had been created in 1909 under the terms of the Morley-Minto Reforms. He eventually overcame his reluctance, stood and was elected in 1917. There he concentrating his efforts on four themes: * Administrative amalgamation into a single entity of the Oriya-speaking regions of Bengal Province, Central Province, Madras Presidency and Bihar and Orissa Province * Eradication of famine and flood in Orissa * Restoration of the region's right to manufacture salt without incurring excise duty * Expansion of education on a model similar to that he had established at the Satyabadi school Das ceased to be a member of the Legislative Council in 1919 or 1920. Prior to his Legislative Council role, Das had been involved in regional politics. He had been a member of Utkal Sammilani from 1903 and was its president in 1919. After its members decided to join the Non-Cooperation movement, made at a conference on 31 December 1920, Das effectively became a member of the Indian National Congress. This was something he had worked towards, having attended meetings of the All India Congress Committee at Calcutta and Nagpur to persuade Mahatma Gandhi to adopt the Utkal Sammilani's primary goal of organising states based on the language spoken. He became the first president of Utkal Pradesh Congress Committee in 1920, holding the post until 1928, and he welcomed Gandhi to the province in 1921. Das was arrested in 1921 for reporting the alleged molestation of a woman by police but was acquitted due to lack of evidence. He was arrested again in 1922, when he received a two-year prison sentence. He was released from Hazaribagh jail on 26 June 1924.  Contribution to journalism  In 1913 or 1915, Das launched and acted as editor for a short-lived monthly literary magazine titled Satyabadi from the campus of his school. Through this he was able to indulge his childhood aspirations to be a poet, while contributions also came from other members of the school's staff, including Nilakantha Das and Godabarish Mishra. Das saw journalism as a means to educate the masses even though they were illiterate. He initially accepted a role editing Asha, a newspaper published in Berhampur, but found it to be too constraining. Thus, in 1919, he started a weekly newspaper called The Samaja, based at the school campus. This was more successful than the literary journal and became a daily publication in 1927 and eventually a significant media presence for Indian nationalists. The writing style was intentionally simplistic. Das had been persuaded to join the Lok Sevak Mandal (Servants of the People Society) some time after meeting Lala Lajpat Rai at a session of Congress in 1920 and the newspaper became a means of promoting it, although operated independently. He served as editor until his death, at which time he bequeathed it to the Society. Published literary works * Karakabita * Bandira Atmakatha Translated as The prisoner's autobiography  *  Death  Gopabandhu became All India Vice-President of the Lok Sevak Mandal in April 1928. He became ill while attending a society meeting in Lahore and died on 17 June 1928. Brahmananda Satapathy, a professor of political science, has said of Das that \\"His crusade against untouchability, advocacy of widow remarriage, campaign for literacy, new model of education, stress on both rights and duties, emphasis on women education, particularly vocational training and above all a deep commitment and compassion for poor and destitutes have immortalised him in Orissa and India\\".

It is built down a hill, close to the Miosson (a tributary of the Clain river). The original castle dates from the time of Philippe VI, the beginning of the 14th century. The present château dates between 1335 and 1609. The remaining original parts represent the keep and 75% of the towers and lower buildings.  History  The former manor (built aside from present day château) lasted until the 14th century. It belonged to the abbey of Ligugé, which sold it in the 11th century to the Anguittard family. At this time, only a feudal motte existed, on the summit of the hill. There are two theories to explain the origin of the castle's name: * generally, place names with Chambon or Chambonneau come from the stem Xambo, that is to say, 'bend in a river'. This name is often reinterpreted as meaning champ bon (good field) and it has thus been understood for a long time as signifying the alluvial soil. * in this particular case, other sources conserved in private archives would indicate an old name of camboniac or campus bonac - good camp (in modern French: camp bon) - indicating that it protected the surroundings against enemies. At the start of the 14th century, new owners, the Frottiers de Chambonneau, constructed an imposing castle designed to reflect developments in artillery. Instead of building on the site of the former stronghold, as was usually done, they decided to build the new castle at the foot of the hill and to profit from the proximity of the river to construct moats. The castle was built to a quadrangular plan, with round towers at the corners, two other towers (rounded on the exterior only) in the middle of the longer sides, and two more towers to defend the gate. The gate was protected by a châtelet. All of the towers were approximately 17m high, the square keep 26m. In 1356, after the capture of Jean II de France (Jean le bon) during the Battle of Poitiers, the English were looking for shelter for the night, to avoid a surprise attack. They presented themselves that evening at Chambonneau, with Jean le Bon in front, demanding shelter for the night. The lord trustingly opened up, and thus lost his castle in one minute. It was, then, in this castle that Jean le Bon spent his first meal in captivity (maybe also the night?).  Transformation into a residence  Under Louis XI, calmer times allowed work to make the castle more comfortable. The curtain wall and towers were demolished on the west side, the keep and gatehouse towers lowered in height, and accommodation buildings constructed symmetrically either side of the gatehouse. In the 16th century, by royal edict the manor was the first to be auctioned in Poitou. Its owner was effectively in debt through gambling. The new owner built between 1605 and 1609 two farms in an L-shape in front of the castle and, in the corners, two pigeon lofts containing 4000 pigeon holes. The southern loft still has its spiral staircase dating from the time of Henri IV. Also added at this time were a chapel (1578) and new accommodation extending the earlier building to the south. Under the First Empire (1810), the castle was bought by Monsieur de La Chaslerie, maternal ancestor of the count of Beaucorps-Créquy (Créquy family). The two gatehouse towers, already greatly reduced in height, were completely removed in 1953, in order to allow access for the owner's wife's car. The Château de Chambonneau has been listed since 1964 as a monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.

It is an active Anglican parish church. The building is Grade II* listed: notable features include its chancel arch made from recycled Roman brick. St Leonard, Sandridge History Some sort of simple wooden church was probably made necessary in 796 when St Albans Abbey took possession of the Manor of Sandridge. However, the Domesday Book does not mention the existence of a church at Sandridge. The oldest surviving feature of the present church is possibly the semi-circular head of the arch between the nave and the chancel, although the date of this uncertain. One theory is that it dates from 946. The brick may have come from a Roman site in the immediate vicinity of Sandridge or from Verulamium; the abbots of St. Albans are known to have had a stockpile of Roman brick, which was one of the materials used in the fabric of the abbey.Stalley, Roger. Early Medieval Architecture, (Google Books link), Oxford University Press, USA, 1999, pp. 112-14, (). The Church prior to its restoration It was no later than 1119 that the church was consecrated and dedicated to St Leonard by Herbert de Losinga 1st Bishop of Norwich (he died in 1119) and that Sandridge became a parish. The nave was enlarged and aisles were added between 1160 and 1180. On either side of the nave are three Norman arches. The font is also thought to date from Norman times. The Early English pointed arch and the tower either built or re-modelled towards the end of the 13th century. The stone screen was added to the wall between the nave and the chancel towards the end of the 14th century. It is richly ornamented on the eastern side but plainer on the west as here there was a carved wooden screen with Rood Loft and Rood above and an altar on each side of the archway into the Chancel. The Chancel was re-built and lengthened in 1399 and the squared headed perpendicular windows replaced the narrower Norman windows in the aisles. The south doorway was also built. The Church Interior After the dissolution of the monasteries many valuable ornaments and fittings of the Church were removed and the church fell into neglect and decay. By 1638 the church was fitted with pews and the arrangement of these has lasted to modern times. A pulpit was erected on the south side of the nave, the remains of which can be seen in the prayer desks in the sanctuary. The tower collapsed in 1692 or 1693 and the church wardens reported that the rebuilding would cost seven hundred pounds. Nothing was done beyond boarding up the arch in the west end and clearing away some of the rubble. The clerestory of the Nave and the roof were in a very bad state in 1710 but where patched up and made to serve until 1786. In 1786 the rotten walls of the clerestory were removed and the roof lowered and flattened out to rest on the Norman arches. Attic windows were put in and the wooden bell turret erected. Between 1836 and 1838 a tower was built. During 1886 - 1887 Mr William White restored the whole church to the state it exists in today. It cost £3800 and re-opened on 7 June 1887. The ring of bells was dedicated on 11 January 1890. =Organ= The organ was given by Mr & Mrs Kinder, Mr & Mrs Marten and Dr Griffith. It dates from about 1880 and was originally a single manual instrument. Before the church's restoration it stood in the chancel, then it was re-built under the tower. In 1914 the instrument was enlarged by Norman and Beard and re-built at the east end of the north aisle. At the same time the pulpit was moved to the north side of the chancel screen and the choir seated in the chancel. The inaugural recital was given in May 1914 by the organist of Temple Church, Walford Davies. Lychgate To the south of the churchyard is a lychgate. This structure, which with its flanking walls is a Grade II listed building, was erected after World War I as a memorial. The dedication of the lychgate in 1921 Plaques list the names of the village's fallen soldiers and also the names of those who served and returned. References *H. R.

The series focuses on Hikari Hanazono, a high school student who holds the second overall position at the elite Hakusen Academy, and her tireless efforts to challenge and hopefully defeat Kei Takishima, the first ranked student and Hikari's rival since childhood, while unaware that Kei is in love with her. Together, they form the Special A class, consisting of the seven top-ranked students of their school, along with their childhood friends Akira Toudou, Tadashi Karino, Megumi and Jun Yamamoto, and Ryuu Tsuji. Special A Students ; Hikari is the protagonist of the story. She holds the 2nd position in school for having the best grades. Self-proclaimed as Kei Takishima's greatest rival, she is determined to beat him in any kind of competition. Stubborn, proud, hard headed, kind, and good-spirited, Hikari never backs down from a challenge, especially one from Kei, and cannot turn away from someone who asks for her help. Though she has never beaten Kei at anything, she constantly looks for opportunities to surpass him and is generally unfazed when he defeats her. While she is good at sports and academics, Hikari is notably very bad at teaching and cooking. She is too strong at times, even breaking things in the process. Although she can handle her own in a fight (often against boys), Kei, nonetheless, gets irritated whenever she puts herself in danger. A kindhearted girl who always worries about others, Hikari sometimes lacks common sense and tends to be unaware towards how people regard her. Her optimistic personality, straightforwardness, and tendency to always see the good in people sometimes prevents her from realizing the more subtle aspects of relationships. Although Hikari is rather sensitive to others, she is quite dense when it comes to love. She is oblivious to the romantic feelings Kei has for her, though everyone else knows that Kei is in love with her. In volume four, Hikari begins to fall in love with Kei, though she does not realize it until volume 6. Hikari felt that if she conveyed her feelings she would lose against Kei, believing that it is all a competition. They eventually admit they are in love with each other and become a couple in chapter 53. ; Kei is ranked first in school, Kei is the son of the CEO of Takishima Corporation. As Hikari's undefeated rival since childhood, he likes to refer to her as \\"Miss Second Place\\", which never fails to provoke her. He has an excellent photographic memory and the ability to do anything right on his first try. He usually prefers to do things on his own until Hikari shows him how much fun it can be to work together with others. Kei loves Hikari, a fact that he does not deny, and has loved her since they were children. However, he has not confessed his love to her because he knows that Hikari does not understand those feelings and would think that he is referring to a love between friends. Although he is stoic most of the time and always maintains a calm facade, things involving Hikari can bring intense anxiety out of him. It always bothers him whenever Hikari pushes herself too hard or causes trouble, but her strong will and determination are the reasons why he admires and respects her. He is always calm in solving problems, but when the problem is about Hikari, he gets really agitated. He makes several attempts to express his feelings to Hikari, though is usually thwarted by some sort of misunderstanding on Hikari's part. Kei eventually confesses to her openly in chapter 32 but Hikari, somewhat realizing she may actually be in love with him, mistakes it as a competition. Later on in chapter 52 Hikari reveals that she reciprocates his feelings; the two start dating and become a couple in the following chapter. ; Jun is ranked 3rd in school and is Megumi's younger twin brother. The son of a music producer and a talented singer, Jun loves music more than anything else, and is a gifted violinist. Usually quiet and kindhearted, Jun has a split personality which he has concealed from everyone except Megumi and Ryuu. Triggered whenever he is kissed by a girl or receives a lot of affection, he becomes irresistible to nearly all women and is able to charm them effortlessly. His split personality resulted from an hypnotism program that Jun watched as a child and first emerged when he was still in grade six. During a date with a girl, he changed and all the other girls around him became mesmerized by him; this led the girl Jun was dating to hate him and call him disgusting. After he begins dating Sakura, Jun's alternate personality emerges whenever he sees her; however, because Sakura accepts him regardless of his personalities, Jun is able to reciprocate her feelings for him. The only thing that can bring Jun back to his original self is by losing consciousness. ; Megumi is ranked 4th in school and is Jun's older twin sister. She is the daughter of a famous vocalist and music producer and shares her brother's love of music. She is a cute and nice girl with long curly brown hair, who rarely joins in disputes. Megumi is always quiet and refuses to speak because she wants to save her voice for singing. She usually writes on a sketchpad to communicate with others, but will speak when deeply upset (usually in the form of a shout), which generally have devastating after- effects. She rarely speaks to people normally on a consistent basis with the exception of Yahiro, who encourages her to sing. Her singing usually causes all who listen to her to get knocked out, however Yahiro theorizes that she probably sings very well, but that it needs to be in an open area and at a great distance. She proves this theory correct when on an involuntary date with him, she sings to him from the top of the stairs. She initially asks Yahiro out because she was trying to prevent him from sabotaging Tadashi and Akira's relationship and sings to him partly out of pity and partly because of a 'game' they are playing. However, they soon begin to develop feelings for each other, much to Jun and Ryuu's horror. Like Jun, she is very close to Ryuu; she can be fiercely protective of them both, and thinks of Ryuu as much of her family as her brother. Megumi also happens to be bad at sports and dislikes athletic activities. ; Innocent and carefree, Tadashi is ranked 5th in school. His mother, a fierce and intimidating woman, is the director of the school and the primary reason why he is in the SA; she told him he would be allowed to do whatever he wanted if he became a member of the SA. He suffers from wanderlust and frequently likes to vanish on some journey and return later for special school events. Often, when he is frustrated, sad, or angry, he enjoys going to a lake he had discovered when he was a child, he has only shown the lake to a few people, among them is Hikari. Tadashi is smarter than he looks and acts, though is usually the character who is most often comically attacked (frequently by Akira and Kei) because of his careless comments or reckless behavior. He loves Akira, but often makes rude, weird, stupid or inappropriate comments that provoke her to beat him up. Tadashi also seems to enjoy playing with puppets, is fond of Akira's cooking, and appears to like provoking her. They eventually begin to date after Tadashi reveals that he does not like it when Akira attends arranged marriage meetings, making Tadashi and Akira the first couple within the S.A group. ; Akira holds the 6th position in school and is the daughter of the owner of an airline company. She is very fond of Hikari and cute girls, but does not get along with Kei in particular, often comparing him to a wild beast. She would often worry too much of Hikari leading her to misunderstand what really happened that time. Akira is very enthusiastic about her afternoon tea, and has even constructed her own kitchen on campus. She prepares food from other countries like bagels, and tea that originated from other nations. Akira apparently loves Tadashi, but never seems to hold back when hitting him for teasing her. In chapter 37 she finally confesses to him; though Tadashi does not explicitly reveal to her his own feelings, he indicates he does reciprocate. But it is shown in episode 18 of the future release of the anime series that Akira confesses her feelings to Tadashi, Tadashi reciprocates by hugging her and a flashback is shown that he actually confessed to Akira when they were still young, although the latter was unable to hear it, in episode 19, it is revealed that they are dating. Because of Akira's parents, she often played with Kei and Yahiro during her childhood days. She was surrounded by the most powerful people in kindergarten, so nobody dared to approach her, since the two are very protective. She used to envy all the other girls who were able to play freely. She was good friends with Yahiro as a child, but due to a misunderstanding resulting from Yahiro's protective and somewhat selfish behavior, she avoids him whenever possible. Her dislike of him stems from Yahiro causing her childhood friend Sayo to despise her when her family had to move away; since Yahiro never told her, that he had discovered Sayo had only befriended Akira because she was rich, in order to protect her, Akira continues to blame Yahiro for the loss of Sayo. She eventually accepts him as one of her friends again, though does not reciprocate Yahiro's feelings for her. ; Ryuu holds the 7th position in school, although his test scores are a poor reflection of his intellectual prowess. He is in 7th place mainly because of the twins - Megumi tends to fall asleep and Jun becomes bored during the test, which results in Ryuu focusing the majority of his attention on them instead of his own exam. As a result, it is suggested that Ryuu could actually be on par with Hikari or Kei. He has been close to Megumi and Jun since they were very young; it is evident that he cares for the twins very much and that the three of them see each other as family. An even-tempered and kindhearted person, Ryuu loves animals, going as far as to construct an animal enclosure, which includes monkeys and elephants, in his own apartment and is good with children. He is also the first amongst the S.A to discover, by accident, Finn's true gender by the end of chapter 50. After spending some time with her, it becomes evident that he is falling in love with Finn. He is the son of the CEO of a sports company and one of his family's clients is Yahiro's family. Supporting characters ; A carefree young man with a sinister side, Yahiro has known both Kei and Akira since they were children. He holds the distinction of having beaten Kei once during their childhood in a game of tag which Kei lost because Yahiro had locked the door to the roof to prevent Kei from winning. Yahiro attends Kokusen Academy, another high school, and is the heir to the Saiga Financial Group, a group that is even higher in status than the Takishima group. Despite his tendency to provoke his friends, he is kinder than he appears and seems to enjoy watching how his friends will react rather than any lasting harm. Because Yahiro's attitude towards others often upset them, he had very few friends as a child aside from Akira and Kei; his relationships with both of them eventually became strained and distant from his overprotective attitude toward Akira, whom he harboured feelings for. After learning how Akira's friend Sayo only befriended her to take advantage of Akira's privileges and status, Yahiro used extreme measures to drive Sayo away. He never told Akira why he had done so, leading her to believe Yahiro had been motivated by jealousy, and he develops a hatred for those who exploited the wealthy. As a result, Yahiro chose not to become friends with anyone until he met Sakura; at first, he had rejected her offer to become friends with her, but complied after they went through a lot of trouble to save the rabbit they were trying to bring back to its home in the mountains. Yahiro eventually gives up his feelings for Akira, telling Tadashi that if he ever makes Akira cry, he will never forgive him, but knows that Tadashi would be better for her. He then starts to accept Megumi's feelings, for Megumi and Yahiro are seen as a future couple. ; Sakura is the daughter of the head of Ushikubo Medical Manufacturing Group and is Kei's first marriage meeting (or omiai) partner to appear in the series. While she does not consider Kei her type, describing him as a \\"dark lord\\" rather than a \\"prince\\", she considers him a possible marriage partner because his abilities would be advantageous to her family's business. Upon meeting Jun, Sakura falls in love with him at first sight, as he fits her ideal of someone who was a \\"prince\\", and accepts his split personality. She begins to date Jun soon after; however, because of her forceful personality, she is uncertain if Jun reciprocates her feelings until he admits to her that he does. Sakura hates dishonest people with a passion, and her family's motto is centered around honesty, as well punishing and loathing dishonest people. Because of Hikari's straightforward and honest nature, the girls become friends. She attends the same school Yahiro does and sometimes plans stuff out with him (whether the plans be good or evil) and enjoys making things extravagant. Sakura first appears in volume 4. ; Aoi Ogata is a junior secretary of President Takishima, Kei's grandfather, and often serves as the President's emissary. A young man of exemplary ability, he is nineteen years old. Aoi has a cold and calm character, and has always been expressionless, not smiling even once, but is actually kindhearted and socially awkward in some respects. Like Kei, he has the ability to see something only once and memorize it, though his ability made him a victim of teasing as a child. He first met Kei when he was eight and Kei was five, and came to admire and deeply respect Kei, coming to see him as an almost kindred spirit. He first appears in chapter 27. Aoi initially appears when he is sent to Japan from London, on orders to convince Kei to transfer to London, which had been planned by Kei's grandfather. When Aoi discovers what is causing Kei to hesitate, Aoi tries to eliminate the problem: Hikari. His various attempts, including threats and bribery, all fail due to Kei's interference and Hikari's own stubborn nature. Though Aoi does not relent his attempts to persuade Kei to move to London, he comes to respect Hikari as someone who makes Kei happy and sincerely likes her. After Hikari learns how much Aoi admires Kei, she and Aoi form the \\"After School Takishima Fan Club,\\" in which Aoi is the president while Hikari's job is to primarily send photos she takes of Kei to Aoi. Aoi eventually realizes that he should not pressure Kei into the situation that he is not ready for and also realizes that he is most at peace when he sees Hikari and Kei smiling. ; Finn is the prince of a small country whose true gender has been concealed from the public. She initially appears as a reluctant participant in a series of arranged marriage meetings Kei's grandfather sets up for Hikari. When Hikari flees from the meeting, Finn approves of her on the spot, since Hikari fits the exact description of Finn's ideal person: a woman with long dark hair possessing a sweet yet tough personality who wears a red dress. After helping Hikari escape, Finn follows her to Japan with the intention of proposing to her. The SA later discover that Finn's mother fits the description of the ideal person Finn wants; Hikari tells Finn that it's a wonderful thing to look up to her mother so much before adding that she and Finn can still be friends. Afterwards, Finn enrolls in Hakusenkan and tries using Ryuu to get closer to Hikari, but ends up becoming very good friends with him. However, her feminine behavior towards him confuses Ryuu until he learns her true gender. Finn's exact ranking in Hakusenkan has not been revealed, but it is known that she is in C class. She first appears in chapter 47. Ryuu discovers not long after meeting Finn that the prince is actually a girl; in Finn's country, the law states that the country must be ruled by a male and if the heir is a female, she will be raised as a male. Upon explaining this to Ryuu, she asks that he keeps her secret as they will be severely punished if it is revealed. Shortly after Hikari discovers Finn's secret, Finn and Hikari attempt to convince Finn's father to allow Hikari to return to Japan rather than face life imprisonment in Finn's country. The issue is resolved when it is revealed that Finn's mother is pregnant and the baby will be a boy; Finn is revealed to be a girl to everyone else and her unborn brother will become the heir to the throne. She and Ryuu also become a couple, and she starts dressing up as a girl at the conclusion of the series. Takishima Family ; Sui is Kei's younger brother and resembles a younger version of Kei. Initially, he dislikes Kei because he finds living with him disgusting and thinks of him as a robot wearing human skin. Because Sui feels very inferior to his brother, who is good at everything, he believes that he cannot reach Kei's level and he refuses to take his studies seriously. However, when he sees that even his \\"perfect\\" brother can become desperate and caring, Sui develops a huge brother complex. Sui likes to call Hikari \\"Stupid Girl\\", but approaches her frequently when he thinks that Kei needs help. He is in grade 6, class B at Hakusen Academy elementary school division. ; Kei and Sui's dad, age 36, who always looks young and baby-faced. He is very energetic and outgoing. Though he is the CEO of the Takishima company, he likes to escape from work and lets Kei handle his job, usually because people at business meetings tend not to take him seriously as a result of his young appearance. To Kei's chagrin, his father also frequently tends to drag his son off to meetings, occasionally in foreign places. Satoru also possesses superb fighting skills and trained in his youth to be as strong as a pro-wrestler; he particularly enjoys Hikari's company because it means they can fight, which Kei usually prevents from happening. He is a good friend of Hikari's father, whom he met through their mutual love of pro-wrestling. Before marrying Midori and into the Takishima family, his surname was . ; Midori, age 37, is Kei and Sui's mother who works overseas in Australia. Both of her sons inherited their looks from her, so they bear a strong resemblance to her. She is obsessed with shopping and longs for the day when Kei will ask her to buy something for him. In Chapter 57, she spends time with Hikari and Kei and goes shopping, but becomes discouraged that Kei still will not ask for anything in particular until Hikari tells her that he only asks for his \\"mommy\\". She and Kei's father met when they were in college; Satoru's attempts to be \\"cool\\" failed to impress her but when she saw his true self, she immediately decided she wanted to marry him. Her relationship with her father, President Takishima, is strained. ; Kei's grandfather, Kaname Takishima, is the head of the Takishima group and is a powerful man in the business circle. However, he is rarely seen by others, including his own family members. He makes his first appearance in chapter 25, when he makes a phone call to Kei's father. When Hikari speaks with him over the phone, he plants the idea in her head that Kei is burdened by her very presence. She meets him face to face in Chapter 59, when President Takishima tries to convince Hikari to transfer schools. He disapproves of Kei's relationship with Hikari and makes many attempts to separate them, such as sending Aoi, arranging marriage meetings for Hikari in London, and arranging a marriage between Kei and a girl named Alisa. The President expresses a strong dislike of Hikari and the mere sight of her sickens him. It is eventually revealed that he feels that he and Hikari share similarities that will make the people they love suffer; as a result, he fears that if Kei remains with Hikari, Kei will suffer much like the Izumi did. ; The deceased grandmother of Kei and Sui and Midori's mother, Izumi appears to have been a gentle and understanding woman well loved by her family. She died from a serious illness when Midori was still a teenager and her death is the reason why Midori's relationship with her father is so strained. When Kaname left her to attend a meeting at her request, her condition took a turn for the worse and died by the time he returned. However, instead of asking for her husband in her final moments, Izumi asked for her steward, Kuze, and Kaname believed she hated him for leaving her. Midori blamed her father for her mother's death and continued to resent him for never visiting her mother's grave, unaware that her father had tried many times, but felt too ashamed to do so. Years later, Kei manages to convince his grandfather to visit Izumi's grave in Australia, where it is revealed that Izumi's final request had been for Kuze to plant the flowers that Kaname would give her whenever he apologized over her grave. Upon seeing this gesture, Kei's grandfather is able to accept Hikari. ; A beautiful girl with unbelievable strength, Nagi is Kei's cousin and is a year younger than he is. She appears during a brief vacation the SA take at Akira's villa, where they intend to celebrate Kei's coming birthday. Extremely arrogant and full of pride, Nagi proclaims herself to be Kei's fiancée and loves him very much. However, she quickly becomes jealous of Kei and Hikari's closeness with one another and ends up acting unpleasantly towards the rest of the SA in order to get Kei's attention. Upset that Kei, the only person she feels comfortable around, cares more about Hikari, Nagi tries to get rid of Hikari, who comes to see that Nagi only wants to please someone she cares about. Afterward, the two reconcile and become friends. Hanazono Family ; Hikari's father is a carpenter and lives in the old shopping district of Tokyo. As a fan of pro- wrestling, he taught Hikari how to fight when she was a child. Through his interest in pro-wrestling, Jiro met Kei's father and they introduced their children to one another when Hikari and Kei were six years old. After Hikari was defeated by Kei, she begged her father to allow her to enroll in the same schools as Kei in order to obtain the opportunity to defeat him. Headstrong and hot-headed like his daughter, Jiro agreed and has since supported her endeavours to defeat her rival. He and Kei's father are friends. ; Atsushi is Hikari's older brother, a calm individual who does not fail to give Hikari his honest opinion. He is currently a junior in high school and attends a normal high school. Unlike Hikari, he doesn't like fighting and he has refrained from any physical fights and yelling since he was little. This is because when they were very young, Hikari saw him beating up a boy who hits her and his facial expression was so scary for her that she fainted. However, when he feels his sister is in danger he breaks away from his peaceful nature and will not hesitate to beat someone up. Even now, Hikari still becomes terrified whenever he becomes truly angry. ; Hikari's mother is a kind and good-natured person who seems to accept Hikari's activities, whether it is taking care of Kei overnight or suddenly travelling to London, without too much fuss. She frequently welcomes Hikari's friends to her house, usually without warning on Hikari's part. However, she does lament that Hikari is unusually strong for a girl (such that she finds it difficult to even see Hikari as a girl at times) and absolutely refuses to allow her daughter to enter the kitchen, well aware of Hikari's destructive inability to cook. Other characters ; Alisa is the fifteen-year-old granddaughter of Theo Appleton, the Takishima group's biggest stockholder. She likes to eat without limit. When Kei is trying to move the main branch of the Takishima group to Japan, one of the conditions to do so was to convince Alisa to study in Japan. To accomplish this, Kei intended to use Alisa's love of food by introducing her to Japanese food; while Alisa had been set on Mexico because she wanted to eat Mexican tacos, she realized how hard Kei had been trying and decided to study in Japan after all. Soon afterward, Kei's grandfather arranges for Kei and Alisa to be engaged, though the arrangement is called off when Aoi takes over as the new CEO of the company. Alisa, curious to see what the girl Kei loves is like, meets with Hikari in Japan and began to give her lessons on to be a good girlfriend. She eventually gives up when she finds that Hikari is unable to directly say that she loves Kei. What Alisa wants most is to know what it feels like for a man to say he loves her. She later develops feelings for Ryuu, and is heartbroken when she discovers he is in love with Finn, who reciprocates his feelings. At the conclusion of the series, she attends Kokusen, the same school as Yahiro and Sakura. ; As of the beginning of Hikari's 2nd year of high school, he is tied 2nd place with Iori Tokiwa, the second son of the head of the Tokiwa Hospital. He has a sickly younger sister who has been receiving medical treatment outside the prefecture and has only recently returned to Tokyo. Upon his introduction, Iori's score on the most recent examination results in the rankings of everyone below Hikari to drop by one place. He also wants to get first place, so Hikari sees him as both a rival and a friend. He dreams of becoming a beautician, so he works part-time in order to earn money, even if it is against school rules to do so, and lives in one room apartment by himself. He develops feelings for Hikari and intends to compete with Kei for Hikari, who is largely unaware of Iori's romantic feelings toward her. After Hikari agrees to grant him a wish if he obtains first place, Iori ties with Kei on the midterm exams and tells Hikari to break up with Kei, though he later brushes it off as a joke. He eventually realizes that Hikari loves Kei and for his wish, he asks Hikari for them to always remain good friends. He first appears in chapter 76. ; Tadashi's mother, age undisclosed, is the director of Private Hakusen Academy. Little is known about her and she never appears in front of the students. A woman whose actions speak for themselves, she is strict and intimidating. She is the primary reason why Tadashi entered the SA class and has threatened to punish him if he gets a lower rank than fifth place. In the past, she frequently punished Tadashi when he failed to please her and does not hesitate to do so in the present when he offends her, often extending the punishment to the rest of the SA if she deems fit. She and her husband were really popular in school when they were still students. As Tadashi stated, his parents always had a boyfriend and girlfriend. ; Chitose is the younger brother of Yahiro and is about nine years old. He initially appears in (Chapter 13 of the manga) Hawaii during the SA's summer vacation when Ryuu (and by extension, the rest of the SA) is forced to entertain Chitose because he is the son of a client for his family. He is close to Ryuu, much to the chagrin of the twins, and it is implied that he has known Kei for a long time. Like his older brother, he dislikes poor people, which leads him to treat Hikari differently from others at first. However, when Hikari shows genuine concern for his well-being despite how badly he treated her, Chitose quickly becomes attached to her. ; When the S.A is punished by the director of the school as a result of Tadashi lying to her, they are forced to attend a regular high school where Akira meets Yui, a girl who resembles her childhood friend Sayo. Initially wary, Akira avoids contact with her, but eventually apologizes and befriends her. However, Akira's fear that Yahiro would break up her newfound friendship results in Akira using extreme measures to protect Yui, who begins to feel awkward around her friends. When Yahiro investigates her for Akira's sake, he discovers that Yui stole some of Akira's jewellery and threatens her so that she will stay away from Akira. Though Yui had done so reluctantly because her family had financial issues that were forcing them to move, she agrees to Yahiro's demand, but she feels that she needs to say goodbye to Akira and almost gets hit by a car in the process. Yahiro saves her and they end up in Yahiro's home, where Akira finds them. When Akira believes that Yahiro has hurt Yui, Yui clarifies that Yahiro saved her and apologizes to Akira for stealing her jewelry. Happy that they are still friends, Akira ends up helping Yui's family and they keep in touch. ; First appearing in chapter five, Hajime Kakei is the Student President at Hakusenkan and holds first place in the class 2-A. He is frequently hospitalized for feeling weak and relies on money to get what he wants. He begins to send various challenges to the SA when nobody appears at his talk show; since none of the SA members wanted to attend his show, nobody else in the student body wanted to either. Because of Hikari's open and kind nature, he seems to develop a crush on her, though is always scared off by Kei before he gets any chance to express his feelings. He is not very popular among his classmates, most of whom do not share his animosity towards the SA. ; Midori Takishima's personal assistant, Kuze is a helpful gentleman who attends to various aspects of Midori's life, such as maintaining her home in Australia and arranging her social events, like her birthday party. He has been employed by the Takishima family for a long time; prior to working for Midori, he was the personal steward of Midori's mother, Izumi. As such, he is aware of details of concerning the Takishima family that others are not, from what kind of food Kei likes to the complete circumstances regarding Izumi's final wishes. ; The mother of Megumi and Jun, age 40, Rin is well known as a genius vocalist who frequently travels the world to perform concerts, having just returned from Germany to Japan. She is cheerful and energetic and, like Kei's father, looks much younger than she actually is. The twins have not seen her in two years and are notably surprised when she drops by to visit them when she happens to have a concert in Japan. Rin is apparently very protective of her children; in response to a letter Megumi had written to her mother when she believed that she had been jilted, Rin reveals a rather bloodthirsty streak and comically pulls out a gun to go and attack the boy who supposedly rejected her daughter. Rin first appears in chapter 85. ; Shinobu, age 18, is Ryuu's older sister. She makes a brief cameo from behind at the beginning of chapter 65, but makes her only actual appearance in an extra comic in the S.A fanbook. Shinobu rarely appears before others, to the extent that Ryuu remarks that even he rarely sees her. An apparently kindhearted young woman, she loves her younger brother greatly to the extent that she has a room filled with photos of him and regularly writes about his daily activities in her diary. When she notes that the Yamamoto twins appear to be drifting apart from him, Shinobu also notices that Finn has been hanging around Ryuu more. She particularly enjoys seeing Ryuu's expression when he is miserable and Ryuu usually endures her attempts to cause it, but draws the line when she tries to encourage Finn to do the same, after which she stops out of guilt and developing a liking for Ryuu's happy expressions instead. ;Nakamura It's a student in the school where the Special A Students attend, he's jealous of them because he wrongly think that they are looking down on them. ;Ohgawara He's a student and one of Nakamur'as friends. ;Takahashi He's a student and one of Nakamur'as friends.

He also co-starred in the 1960s television series Johnny Midnight (39 episodes), with Edmond O'Brien. He was a star of movies, early television, and the stage. His Broadway stage credits include Auntie Mame with Rosalind Russell, and Pacific Overtures, a musical written by Stephen Sondheim and directed by Harold Prince. Early life Yuki Shimoda was born Yukio Shimoda in Sacramento, California on August 10, 1921. His father was Chojiro Shimoda, who emigrated from the town of Shimoda in Kumamoto prefecture on the island of Kyūshū in Japan. Chojiro left Japan in his early teens because he did not want to be a sweet potato farmer on the family farm and was tired of eating sweet potatoes every day. Shimoda's mother was Kikuyo (Nakamura) Shimoda, also from Kumamoto prefecture. Kikuyo was born to an influential, wealthy, noble samurai family, and her father was a doctor. She left Japan to have freedom as a modern woman and to marry for love rather than marry by arrangement (omiai). Shimoda was the oldest of three children. His younger brothers were Noboru \\"Dave\\" Shimoda, who lived to the age of 82, and James Shimoda, who died as a child of a bacterial infection before the age of antibiotics. Shimoda always had an interest in dancing and acting. As a child, he insisted on being called Fred because he wanted to be like Fred Astaire. In Sacramento, he worked in the family businesses, which included a restaurant, pool hall and boarding house. His parents' restaurant employed a Filipino cook and friend named Felix, who was killed in World War II by the Japanese. This hardened his intense feelings of being an American. His parents were hard working and affluent even during the Great Depression; Shimoda's father owned a Cadillac limousine that he bought from the Japanese government in a time when many people still owned horses. Shimoda worked hard in his adolescence to help his parents, but he made time to dance and act. He studied ballet as well as kendo and judo which helped him become more graceful. Shimoda attended Sacramento High School. Studying an American curriculum by day, Shimoda filled his evenings and Saturdays attending Japanese language school. Yuki and Noboru were also Boy Scouts. Shimoda's studies at Sacramento Junior College (now known as Sacramento City College) were interrupted when, along with over 100,000 other Japanese-American Issei, Nisei, Kibei Nisei and Sansei; his family was relocated to a Japanese American internment camp after the entry of the United States into World War II per Executive Order 9066. His parents (Issei, or first generation immigrants to America from Japan) were incarcerated without a trial and for no just cause. He spent the duration of World War II in the Tule Lake War Relocation Center in northern California. Shimoda made the best of the incarceration by entertaining his fellow internees with his acting, dancing and singing abilities. Once he dressed like Carmen Miranda complete with fruit on his head to dance and sing to the delight of the camp audience. Seeing his parents lose all their hard-earned possessions and being incarcerated in a concentration camp was particularly hard for a Nisei like Shimoda because he had been raised as an American. Shimoda and Noboru tried to volunteer for the United States Army after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Shimoda eventually was classified 4F or ineligible for the draft due to a congenital heart murmur. As a child, his parents were told that he would not live to adulthood due to his bad heart. Shimoda left the internment camp alone and was one of the first to leave. Evacuees were not allowed to go back to the West Coast at first and Shimoda was informed by officials at Tule Lake that Chicago was receptive to Japanese-American re- settlers because Irish-American politicians there—being victims of discrimination themselves—understood the predicament of the evacuees. Shimoda lived in Chicago for several years and graduated with a degree in accounting from Northwestern University. He worked at the University of Chicago and taught a class in learning the Japanese language He studied improvisational acting with the Compass Players, who sprung from the University of Chicago, a precursor of the Second City. Many Asian American actors as Beulah Quo, the co-founder of East West Players, with Mako Iwamatsu considered him to be an actor's actor, which she stated in the documentary Yuki Shimoda: Asian American Actor. Shimoda never married and did not have any children. Career Shimoda's movie credits from the 1960s and 1970s range from B movies as Seven Women from Hell with Caesar Romero and Yvonne Craig to A movies as Midway with Charlton Heston, Eddie Albert, Henry Fonda, James Coburn, Glenn Ford, Toshirō Mifune, Robert Mitchum, Cliff Robertson, Robert Wagner, James Shigeta and Noriyuki \\"Pat\\" Morita. He also was in the martial arts movie The Octagon with Chuck Norris. In the Disney movie The Last Flight of Noah's Ark with Elliott Gould and Rick Schroder, Shimoda's character was one of two Japanese soldiers on a deserted Pacific island decades after the end of World War II who do not know the war is over. Shimoda's favorite movie was Farewell to Manzanar, later bought by Walt Disney Pictures to televise on the Disney Channel. Farewell to Manzanar was a television movie that stars an all Japanese-American cast and presents the story of the relocation of Japanese Americans into American-style concentration camps. Shimoda appeared in MacArthur with Gregory Peck and in The Horizontal Lieutenant with Jim Hutton, Paula Prentiss, Jim Backus and Miyoshi Umeki. Shimoda had numerous television credits. The miniseries A Town Like Alice was broadcast internationally and in the United States on Masterpiece Theatre. A Town Like Alice was the first non-British production to air in the United States on Masterpiece Theatre. In the television miniseries, The Immigrants Shimoda played the part of Chinese-American immigrant Feng Wo. He guest-starred on popular television shows of the 1960s and 1970s, such as Adventures in Paradise, The Big Valley, Hawaiian Eye, The Andy Griffith Show, McHale's Navy, Mr. Ed, Peter Gunn, Love American Style, Wonder Woman, Hawaii Five-O, Sanford and Son, M.A.S.H. and Quincy, M.E. On Quincy, M.E., Shimoda starred as Dr. Hiro, a forensic medical examiner in the episode \\"Has Anybody Here Seen Quincy?\\" that did not include star Jack Klugman. Shimoda was considered for a spin-off of Quincy, M.E., where he would be a coroner like Thomas Noguchi, the Los Angeles County coroner to many newsworthy deaths. Shimoda filled in time between engagements with television commercial work, such as the Chrysler ad of the 1970s where Mr. T (Toyota) and Mr. D (Datsun – Nissan) admire a Dodge Colt and say \\"Very nice, Mr. D.\\" \\"I thought it was one of yours, Mr. T.\\" Shimoda preferred to act as the honorable Japanese soldier or sailor like Dr. Matsumo, the good Japanese military physician, in Seven Women from Hell. This movie was released in 1961 and shows the humane side of the former enemy. Shimoda's Broadway career started when he moved to New York City from Chicago to get more roles as an actor and dancer on stage. Ultimately he was hired as one of the early Asian-American actors on Broadway. From 1953 to 1956, Shimoda appeared in the Teahouse of the August Moon. Shimoda got his big break when he landed the part of Ito in the Broadway hit Auntie Mame. From 1956 to 1958, he starred opposite Rosalind Russell. After the play finished on Broadway, he recreated his role in the 1958 film. His income from his acting career plus the knowledge he gained from the accounting degree he earned from Northwestern University allowed him to live a comfortable lifestyle. He devoted his free time to help young actors in the East West Players, a Los Angeles-based, Asian-American theatre group. Death He died in Los Angeles of colon cancer that metastasized to his liver on May 21, 1981. He quit smoking cigarettes and social drinking of alcohol in his later years. Yuki Shimoda's ashes were originally in the Little Tokyo district of Los Angeles at the Nishihongwanji Buddhist Temple. They have been moved to Sacramento, California so his remains could rest with his family in their hometown. A 30-minute documentary film of his life was made and released in 1985 by Visual Communications (VC) of Los Angeles: Yuki Shimoda: Asian American Actor. It includes clips of an interview with him before his passing.

It was established in its current form in December 2003 by former maegashira and Nihon University amateur champion Higonoumi, who branched off from Mihogaseki stable. The stable's first top division wrestler was Kiyoseumi in January 2008. Its foreign recruit is the Georgian Gagamaru who in May 2010 earned promotion to the top division. It is a popular destination for wrestlers with collegiate sumo experience like its stablemaster. Following the demotion of Kise-oyakata (or stablemaster) in May 2010 after a scandal involving the selling of tournament tickets to members of the yakuza, Kise stable was dissolved with all 27 of its wrestlers moving to the affiliated Kitanoumi stable. Kise was allowed to reestablish the stable in April 2012. All former members, as well as newcomers Jōkōryu and Sasanoyama (now Daiseidō), joined the reconstituted stable. Jōkōryu reached the rank of komusubi in 2014, but has since fallen greatly down the ranks due to injury, and Daiseidō in September 2017 became the eleventh wrestler from Kise to reach jūryō since its founding in 2003.. As of January 2020, it has 36 wrestlers, making it one of the largest in sumo; six of them are sekitori (salaried ranks). Kise stable's first makuuchi championship was delivered by Tokushōryū in the January 2020 tournament. The 33-year-old won from the bottom-most makuuchi rank of maegashira 17, after spending all but one of the previous 12 tournaments in the jūryō division. Ring name conventions Some wrestlers at this stable take ring names or shikona that begin with the characters 肥後 (read: higo), in honor of their coach and the stable's owner, the former Higonoumi. The best known is former jūryō wrestler Higonojō. Some other low- ranking members are Higoarashi, Higonoryū, and Higohikari.

The book, which is a collection of the legends current in Ḥasidic circles about the founder of Ḥasidism, is also of great historical value. Baer, being a son-in- law of the Alexander who was for several years a secretary of the Besht, received from his father-in-law valuable information on the origin of Ḥasidism, and on the founder of the sect; hence his book is almost the only source of authentic information on those subjects.

The Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow. Cyril of Beloozero (Cyril of Beloezero, - Kirill Belo(e)zersky; 1337 - 1427) was a monk and saint of the Russian Orthodox Church who lived in the 15th century. Saint Cyril was a disciple of Saint Sergius of Radonezh. In 1397, he founded the Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery in Northern Russia, in the present-day Vologda Oblast. Biography Cyril was born as Kosma in Moscow in 1337. His origin is not entirely clear, but he was in any case close to the boyar family of Velyaminov. Cyril's parents died when he was a child. Around 1380 he became a monk in the Simonov Monastery and took the name of Cyril (Kirill). In the monastery, he got in contact with Sergius of Radonezh. In 1387, the archimandrite of the Simonov Monastery, Feodor, was appointed a bishop of Rostov, and Cyril became his successor. However, he soon realized that the position of archimadrite required too much involvement in public affairs, and first resigned, then moved to a neighboring monastery as an ordinary monk, and then decided to move to a deserted place where he could pray in peace. Together with St. Therapont, previously the monk of the same monastery, Cyril left for Lake Beloye. On arrival, following the advice of Sergius of Radonezh, he first dug a cave, and then built a wooden Assumption chapel and a loghouse for other monks. Therapont, who found the restriction imposed by Cyril too strict, left within a year and founded nearby the Ferapontov Monastery. In what became Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery, Cyril established a very strict order. The monastery grew and later became the largest monastery of Northern Russia. Cyril, as the first hegumen, arranged purchases of large areas of land by the monastery. Cyril of White Lake died in the monastery in 1427, at the age of ninety. At present there are several churches in Russia bearing the name of Cyril.

The episode was written by David Mills from a story by David Simon & David Mills and was directed by Agnieszka Holland. It first aired on February 3, 2008. Plot Summary Marlo assumes Proposition Joe's position as The Greeks' narcotics distributor in Baltimore. Vondas gives him a phone and shows him how to communicate with the Greeks without speaking. Marlo continues to use Levy to launder money and gives Levy his new cell phone number; Herc copies the number after hours. Partlow tells his family he is going away and prepares to ambush Omar in Monk's apartment. Dukie gets beaten up by Spider when he stands up to a bully on his corner. Michael takes Dukie to Cutty's gym to learn how to defend himself. Cutty tries to explain to Dukie that his intelligence gives him some prospects and that even if he learns how to fight, it won't necessarily stop him from being attacked. Michael also tries to teach Dukie how to shoot, but his ineptitude at target practice leads him to recommend that Dukie avoid using guns. Bond holds a press conference to announce the corruption charges against Senator Davis. Campbell convinces Davis to take the weight of the charges himself, and Davis begins a publicity campaign claiming that the investigation against him is racially motivated. Bubbles is amazed when he is given a negative HIV test and Walon tells him to let go of his shame over Sherrod's death. Herc gives Marlo's cell phone number to Carver, who in turn gives it to Freamon. However, Freamon is unsuccessful in convincing Daniels to approach Mayor Carcetti about opening a new investigation into Marlo. McNulty invents more details about his fake serial killer and leaks the story to Alma at the Baltimore Sun. Templeton is assigned by Gus to canvass the homeless, but he has little success and invents a quote from the \\"father of a homeless family\\". The resulting story draws attention to the case and Daniels appeals to Carcetti for resources. The mayor only allows Greggs to assist McNulty, who, under pressure from Bunk, tells her to keep working her own cases. Freamon and McNulty decide to stage a phone call from the killer to give them probable cause for a wiretap on Marlo's cell phone number. When Templeton fakes a call to himself from the serial killer, McNulty seizes the opportunity. The story takes the front page. Freamon sets up a disconnected wiretap in Homicide that the police believe is monitoring the fake killer's cell phone, while Freamon uses the court paperwork to set up his own wiretap on Marlo's phone. Elsewhere, Elena confronts McNulty about his failing relationship with Beadie, while Beadie seeks advice from Bunk. Omar and Donnie break into Monk's apartment where they are ambushed by Partlow, Snoop, Michael and O-Dog. Donnie is killed and Omar jumps from the fourth- floor balcony and disappears.

The episode was written by Ed Burns (from a story by David Simon and Ed Burns) and was directed by Seith Mann. It aired on February 10, 2008. Plot Summary As Marlo's crew searches in vain, an injured Omar hides himself in the same building where he was ambushed by Monk, Partlow, and Snoop. He threatens Fat Face and takes his gun, which he uses to wound a Stanfield soldier before setting fire to one of Marlo's cash pickups. Marlo increases the bounty on Omar's head, ends the New Day Co-Op, and ups the wholesale drug price. A wary Slim Charles declines Marlo's offer for control of the Baltimore County territories, which are instead given to Cheese. At the Baltimore Sun, Templeton's reporting on the \\"serial killer\\" gets national attention, leading editors Whiting and Klebanow to ask for a follow-up article. Templeton spends the night under the Jones Falls Expressway and interviews Terry, a homeless Iraq War veteran with PTSD. Gus is surprised with Templeton's writing, but remains skeptical of his reporting overall. He asks Templeton to pursue a lead on the story of a woman who died from seafood poisoning. When Templeton claims the lead was false, Gus gets more suspicious. McNulty realizes that Templeton made up a few details of his own about the killer. Bunk, thoroughly disgusted with McNulty's behavior, dives back into the old murder cases tied to Marlo's crew. He decides to interview Randy Wagstaff, who remains in his group home, but he refuses to cooperate. Greggs tells Bunk that an informant implicated Marlo's crew for her triple homicide. They learn that evidence from the vacant murders has become irrevocably jumbled due to human error. Bunk then investigates the killing of Bug's father and interviews Michael's mother. He is given a folder of stolen grand jury indictments found in Proposition Joe's shop. Meanwhile, Mayor Carcetti hosts a ribbon-cutting ceremony for portside condos while being heckled by ex- dockworkers, including Nick Sobotka. Later, Carcetti gives a press conference vowing to protect the homeless from the \\"serial killer.\\" Wilson and Steinhorf suggest that running on defending the homeless may be Carcetti's key to getting elected governor. Daniels hands the stolen indictments to Pearlman and Bond, who realize there is a leak in the courthouse. Judge Daniel Phelan declines McNulty and Pearlman's request for a wiretap on the Sun's phones. Freamon reveals his illegal wiretap of Marlo to Sydnor, who agrees to help. He determines that Marlo is sending photos, but a new wiretap authorization is needed to see what is being sent. McNulty finds that, with police now arriving on the scene immediately whenever a homeless person turns up dead, he is unable to stage more serial murders. He comes across a mentally ill homeless man named Larry and, with Freamon's help, photographs him with the \\"killer\\"'s trademark ribbon, after which Larry will never be seen again; the killer, according to the cover story, will now only send photos of his victims to the press, and their bodies will not be found. McNulty gives Larry $100 and drives him down to a homeless shelter in Richmond, Virginia, giving him a stolen ID card. As he leaves, he feels a pang of guilt over what he has done to Larry.

The episode was written by Richard Price from a story by David Simon & Richard Price and was directed by cast member Dominic West. It aired on February 17, 2008. Plot Summary McNulty, Freamon, and Sydnor plot to get Templeton to take a phone call from the \\"serial killer.\\" McNulty, posing as the killer, acts upset about Templeton's articles painting him in a sexual light and says that no more bodies will be found in Baltimore; instead, he will simply send pictures of his victims. Both the BPD and The Baltimore Sun prioritize the serial killer and resolve to see the case to its end. Freamon, now able to intercept cell phone images via his illegal wiretap on Marlo, runs up against a tougher code than he expected - a simple clock face showing a different time in each picture - and he needs more manpower to determine what these messages mean. McNulty, knowing the serial killer case is a hoax, sends his surveillance teams to Freamon while allocating the extra manpower assigned to him to allow other detectives to earn their overtime pay. McNulty is overwhelmed as the bosses offer him more and more men. Eventually, the fact that he's giving away time gets out and people come looking for it. Knowing the truth about McNulty's hoax, Bunk refuses to attend a mandatory meeting about the serial killer and instead goes back to investigating the vacant murders. Carver brings in Michael to let Bunk interview him about his stepfather. Omar robs a Stanfield stash house, killing a soldier and flushing several kilos of heroin. He later traps and executes Savino Bratton, now working for Marlo. Later, Omar tells Michael that he will take out all Marlo's muscle until Marlo comes at him himself. Gus consults his old friend, Major Dennis Mello, about whether someone can go through the court system with a false name. Mello's answer casts doubt on Templeton's reporting. Gus and Corbett show disgust at Templeton's maudlin story about living with the homeless. Gus sends Sun reporter Mike Fletcher to research the homeless, which leads Fletcher to Bubbles' soup kitchen. Bubbles guides Fletcher to the Jones Falls Expressway, where he talks to local homeless. When Fletcher offers to pay Bubbles, he turns him down and tells him to \\"write it how it feels\\". Senator Davis hires high-powered attorney Billy Murphy. Despite another round of incriminating testimony from Damien Price, Davis is able to charm the jury and present himself as a man of the people. To the shock of Bond and Pearlman, Davis is acquitted. Greggs, assigned to the homeless killings full-time, spends an entire day getting background information on the homeless victims. She plans to keep her ex-partner's son Elijah for the night and asks McNulty where to get children's furniture. He recommends IKEA, but fails to inform her that their furniture must be assembled. Having apparently failed to assemble the bed, Greggs lets Elijah use her own bed. However, when Elijah can't sleep, Greggs sits with him in the apartment window and says good night to the denizens of the inner city à la Goodnight Moon.

Biography Georges Boulanger was born in Tulcea, Romania, from a Romani (Gypsy) family with a very long tradition in music. His father was Vasile Pantazi, nicknamed \\"Boulanger\\". He was known as one of the typical Romanian virtuosi. He learned to play the violin as a child from his father, who was already the sixth generation musician. At the age of 12, Georges Boulanger got a scholarship to study at the Conservatory in Bucharest. Three years later he was heard by Leopold Auer who took him to Dresden with him and where he studied with him for the next two years. Other students of Auer were Jascha Heifetz, Nathan Milstein, and Mischa Elman. In 1910, when Boulanger was 17 years old, Leopold Auer told him that his musical studies were finished and gave him a violin as a going away present. Boulanger played on this violin until his death. Under the recommendation of Auer, Georges Boulanger received a position of first violinist in the Café Chantant in Saint Petersburg, Russia. This was where many aristocrats frequented. With his \\"background music\\", a mixture of Romani music, Balkan folklore and Viennese waltzes he found that many people in the public enjoyed his taste in music. This music is also known as salon music. It was here in Russia that Georges Boulanger met a young girl from Estonia named Ellionorr Paulson. She was an intellectual student of law and medicine. They eventually got married and had two daughters, Nora and Georgette. In 1917 Georges Boulanger left Russia and returned to Romania. In 1922/23 he went to Berlin where he played for his old audiences of Russian Aristocrats that now lived in Berlin. In the year 1926, his name suddenly became well-known. Boulanger played in radio transmissions that were broadcast live throughout the country. He played in the most famous houses in Berlin and other large European cities such as the Savoy Hotel in London. He was signed by the Bote & Bock Edition who published his musical compositions. The melody of his popular 1926 song Avant de mourir became a popular standard with the addition in 1939 of lyrics by Carlos Gomez Barrera and Jimmy Kennedy, retitled \\"My Prayer\\". In 1956 the recording of \\"My Prayer\\" by US R&B-pop; act The Platters spent 23 weeks on Billboard's Hot 100, five of then at number one. Billboard ranked the single as the fourth biggest of the year. Boulanger lived in Germany from the early 1920s until 1948 when he moved to South America. He worked in Brazil then settled in Argentina for the rest of his days. He died in Olivos, Buenos Aires. Compositions George Boulanger wrote about 250 compositions.

The episode was written by Dennis Lehane from a story by David Simon and Dennis Lehane and was directed by Anthony Hemingway. It aired on February 24, 2008. Plot Summary Michael informs Partlow and Snoop about his confrontation with Omar. Soon afterwards, Omar goes to a corner store to buy cigarettes and is shot to death by a street kid named Kenard. At a COMSTAT meeting, McNulty updates his superiors and Mayor Carcetti on the \\"serial killer\\" case. Carcetti approves McNulty's request to let Carver join the investigation. Carver questions why McNulty picked him over a sergeant from the district where the murders occurred, and guesses that Freamon is running a wiretap. While Carver assembles surveillance teams, McNulty helps Bunk take a request for DNA matching to the crime lab. McNulty arrives home to find that Beadie has left a note saying she is not sure when she and her children will return. When McNulty and Greggs travel to Quantico, Virginia, to get FBI assistance, he is disturbed when the Bureau's psychological profile reflects his own personality. Back in Baltimore, Bunk finds himself investigating Omar's murder and realizes from a hit list that he was hunting Marlo's crew. Bunk delivers the list to McNulty, and reluctantly agrees to hold back on a murder warrant for Partlow so that Freamon can make a break in the Stanfield investigation. McNulty pulls Greggs into an interview room and comes clean about fabricating the case. Greggs tells McNulty he cannot carry on with his plan, but McNulty tries to reassure her that it will all be over soon. Beadie eventually returns with her children and confronts McNulty, prompting him to confess to her as well. Freamon intercepts a coded message from Marlo to organize a meeting with Partlow. He meets with the U.S. Attorney with the evidence from the Davis investigation, hoping to take the case federal now that local prosecution has failed. The U.S. Attorney refuses to take the case, since Davis is now a martyr to the black community. When McNulty hands him Omar's hit list, he recognizes Cheese's name. McNulty admits that he has told Greggs about the hoax, much to Freamon's dismay. While tracking Marlo, Sydnor pulls out a street atlas and realizes that the page numbers correspond to the clock messages. He then decodes the clock settings as codes for the Cartesian coordinates of the location on each indicated page. Freamon tracks Davis to a bar and threatens him with the prospect of a new case at the federal level. Davis assumes Freamon is trying to blackmail him for money, to which Freamon instead demands answers. Freamon returns to the office to find that Sydnor has cracked the code. Sydnor is perplexed that the code gives only a location and not a time to meet, and Freamon postulates that the meetings are to happen within an hour. Freamon makes a connection between the messages and guesses that Cheese is involved in the East Side meetings. Greggs arrives and chastises Freamon for his involvement in the hoax, saying that she is not good with the plan. Elsewhere, Dukie goes into a sporting goods store to seek a job and is told he is too young. Dukie recognizes the clerk as Malik \\"Poot\\" Carr, who recommends that Dukie go back to the street for a while and then apply for a job when he is older. Dukie leaves the store and helps a junk man. Dukie is offered more work the next day. To deflect from his weakness on crime in the upcoming campaign, Mayor Carcetti and Steintorf decide to use the serial killings to attack the governor for cutting funds to homeless programs. Wilson learns that the mayor is facing a primary challenger named Dobey. Carcetti and Wilson drive to Prince George's County to persuade Congressman Upshaw, who is considering supporting Dobey, to remain in his camp. He then meets with Senator Davis and Campbell and makes concessions to them in exchange for their support. At a homeless vigil, Carcetti gives a rousing speech as Campbell, Wilson and Steintorf look on approvingly. Upon returning home, he complains to his wife Jen about the compromises he has been forced to make, revealing that Upshaw demanded that half of Baltimore's federal funding be allocated to his county. Jen is horrified at the prospect of the city giving up that much funding, but Carcetti rationalizes that if he does not get elected, Baltimore will get nothing. At The Baltimore Sun, Gus arranges a face-to-face meeting between Templeton and Terry, who angrily accuses the former of falsifying their discussion. Templeton is unable to respond when Hanning asks what would happen if one of the Marines he served with had read the story and noticed the fabrication. Afterwards, Gus informs Templeton that they will investigate the complaint and attribute it to a misunderstanding, but that a correction will be printed if more details are found to be incorrect. Gus, intrigued by Fletcher's story about Bubbles, asks Fletcher to see what comes of spending more time with him. He cuts the lede from Templeton's story on the homeless vigil for including an unsourced anecdote. Templeton angrily turns to Klebanow, who overrides Gus's decision. Gus then leaves the newsroom. Production =Title reference= The title refers to Haynes telling Templeton that he may have to submit a clarifications and corrections piece for Templeton's embellishing of Hanning's story. It may also refer to McNulty coming clean about his ruse. Additionally, the title refers to the mixed up identity tags on the bodies of Omar Little and the middle aged white man in the body bag next to his. The morgue attendant rectifies this by switching them back. =Epigraph= Homeless Marine veteran Terry Hanning says this as a rebuttal to journalist Scott Templeton while they're arguing, cutting each other off, and Templeton wants to tell \\"[his] side of the story.\\" =Credits= Starring cast Although credited, Deirdre Lovejoy, Andre Royo, Domenick Lombardozzi, and Michael Kostroff do not appear in this episode.

The population of the village was 5,075 in the 2011 national population and housing census.2011 Alphabetical Index of Villages , Central Statistics Office The village is characterised by many river valleys, tributaries to the Shashe River which serve as boundaries to the village wards (dikgotla). History The village is originally an ethnic kalanga and is currently ruled by She Itekeng Mongwaketsi Mathangwane. In year 2008, Mathangwane planned celebrations for its centenary anniversary.Mathangwane Hits Centenary Mark, Mmegi Online In the 1980s, Mathangwane was known for vehicle accidents that occurred on a one-lane road bridge across the Shashe River linking the village to the City of Francistown. At the time, there were rumours that the vehicle accidents were caused by a resident evil ghost which deceived drivers into driving off the bridge at night. The old one-lane road bridge was replaced in the mid 1990s with a new two lanes single carriageway bridge and the village saw an end to tragic vehicle accidents at the bridge river crossing. With the emergence of Francistown as a city in 1997 and the political and economic instability in Zimbabwe, Mathangwane saw an influx of migrants from other tribes of Botswana who couldn't afford accommodation rentals in the new city and illegal immigrants from Zimbabwe who fled economic collapse and political persecution causing rapid growth to the village population. These influx led to indigenous villagers being made to forfeit their farmland around the village to government for allocation to newcomers as residential land.Available Land in Botswana In 2003, Mathangwane was made the headquarters of the newly established Tonota-North Constituency following a constitutional amendment which increased the number of constituencies in Botswana from 40 to the present 57 seats.History of the Parliament , Parliament of Botswana The Constituency has since been renamed Shahe-West following a number of heated high level Kgotla meetings in Mathangwane where the majority of residents pointed out their detest of the former name.Villagers request name changed  Climate  =Climate Chart= =Tropical Cyclone Dineo= In February 2017, Tropical Cyclone Dineo triggered destructive floodsCyclone Dineo to trigger weekend downpours in and around Mathangwane, badly damaging the A3 highway between the City of Francistown and Sebina Junction and further north from the village of Nata to Gweta, badly disrupting traffic with some parts of the road having to be temporarily closed for safety.A3 road along Nata village damaged in the wake of flash floods The damages to the A3 highway later became a death trap, causing a rise in fatal vehicle accidents in and around Mathangwane following delays by the Ministry of Transport and Communications in effecting repairs.Fatal car crash on A3 highwayCyclone Dineo leaves P572m bill for roads Infrastructure =Schools= Mathangwane Primary School 86 years anniversary commemorative plaque - 10 September 2016 Mathangwane Primary School 86 years anniversary commemorative plaque - 10 September 2016 There are two primary schools in the Village namely Mathangwane Primary School and Mpatane Primary School, one junior secondary school called Chamabona Junior Secondary School - formally Chamabona Community Junior Secondary School before formally being completely taken over by the Government, and two day-care centres in Mathangwane. There is no senior secondary school in the Village. After attaining junior certificate, children are often admitted to either Shashe River School, Mater Spei College, Tutume McConnell Community College or Masunga Senior Secondary School. This arrangement long proved strenuous to underprivileged families with their children dropping from school or performing badly in form five examinations due to the economic pressure. =Roads= With the exception of the A3 highway going through the village, all village internal roads are dirt roads mostly impassable after heavy rains; existing un-bridged river valleys within the village along the roads are a challage to villagers' free movement. Villagers eagerly approved plans for the construction of Mmandunyane-Shashe Mooke-Borolong-Chadibe-Mathangwane road in early 2007 which they viewed as the only hope for the improvement of the village internal road infrastractures. Arup Botswana was appointed for the construction of the road which totaled 70 km in length. It later emerged that in light of the revenue constraints due to the ongoing global economic and financial crisis, the Central District Council (CDC) decided to prioritise its projects and the impending road was never constructed.Central District Council Prioritises Projects =Healthcare Facility = The healthcare consists of one clinic with full-time general nurses and a doctor to handle short time inpatients. Since the turn of 2000 the only improvements to the clinic was the construction of a Maternity Ward and addition of a Caraven which serves as a Voluntary HIV counselling and testing (VCT) centerHIV and AIDS in Botswana being part of Botswana's national HIV treatment programme; the move which saw the Government of Botswana being commended by World Health Organization for demonstrating a very high level of political commitment to addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the success considered a fine example of how antiretroviral therapy can be provided on a large scale in resource- constrained settings.WHO estimate of number of people requiring treatment in Botswana The clinic refers major cases to the Nyangabwe Referral hospital and patients with mental disorder to Jubilee hospital which are both located in Francistown. =Potable Water= The village was connected to the Shashe Dam water supply reticulation through Francistown in 2001. This was followed by the upgrading of the Shashe Dam water treatment plant to augment increased water demand.Water treatment plant upgrade Before the implementation of The Water Sector Reforms Programme in February 2010 through which water supply in the village was taken over by Water Utilities Corporation, water connections applications and water bill payments were done in Tutume which is 75 km west of the village. =Village Shortfalls= Villagers receive Government services from different places with vast geographical distances, i.e. City of Francistown, Tonota, Tutume, Marapong, Masunga and Serowe, and this disadvantage locals from benefiting from existing government programs and services. Like many Botswana villages, community developments and minor projects that do not require expert consultancy are controlled by a group of volunteers called the Village Development Committee (VDC). Majority of Mathangwane VDC volunteers use it as a platform to gain popularity before joining the village politics; an unproductive and egocentric practice hindering the success of the Village VDC. Villages similar to Mathangwane in size and population through their VDC developed community projects that continue to sustain the livelihood of their villagers, for example, Mathangwane does not have a Community Hall nor rented small business stalls all which are schemes supported by government through community projects and long proved worthy in income generation for small communities like Mathangwane. Demographics Mathangwane is divided into wards or dikgotla. They are Mathangwane (main ward), Mpatane, Nkuelegwa, Matshegong/Mathiwa (nicknamed 'Palamakuwe' for its residents' noisy unruly parting style in the early 1980s), and other wards that emerged with village growth. Each kgotla has its own sub-chief or Kgosana. Until recently, Hobona village, 10 km west of Mathangwane along the road from Francistown to Nata was one of the main and oldest wards of Mathangwane under the leadership of Mfi Kgosana Seitshwenyeng Hobona. Settlement in the area may have been chosen for the presence of perennial water sources (from the Shashe and Vukwi Rivers). In the late 20th century the village streached along the river bank from the North to the South with the west being locals' seasonal farm land. The eastern side of the Shashe River is the North East District and is predominately elite villagers' farm land and ranches administered in Masunga Village. The increase in population and water system reticulation by government saw new settlers being allocated residential land on the underprivileged villagers' seasonal farm land in the west. This prompted locals to informally call the area 'New Xadi' (named after the government resettlement area for the former Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR) San people in the Ghanzi DistrictStatement by Ditshwanelo - The Botswana Centre For Human Rights). Politics =Brief History= The Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) dominated the village local government politics since the first elections in Botswana in 1965 making the village a BDP stronghold. Mfi Chite was the first councilor for the village following a win in the October 1974 general elections; this was after the 1972 constitutional amendment which grouped villages of Borolong, Chadibe, Makobo, Mathangwane, Natale and Shashe Mooke into a single council ward un-axing them from the then Tonota council ward. The grouping was broken down further in 1982 constitutional amendment un-axing villages of Borolong, Natale, and Shashemoke from the ward. Mfi Chite retained the council seat for BDP in both the 1979 and 1984 general elections. Mfi Rabeka Hulela won the council seat again for the BDP in the October 1989 general elections following Mfi Chite's retirement from politics at the end of his office term in 1989. Mfi Hulela retained the council seat for the BDP in the October 1994 general election and remained the ward councilor until her death in 1998, after which the ward remained without a councilor until the October 1999 general elections, when Mfi Tabona Munyadzwe won the ward for the BDP. In 2000, Mr. Ookame Ntobedze won the by-elections of the ward for the BDP following the passing of Mr. Tabona Munyadzwe. In 2003, another constitutional amendment saw Mathangwane being split into two council wards (Mathangwane North and Mathangwane South Council wards). BDP won both council wards in the October 2004 general elections with Mr. Ookame Ntobedzi representing the Mathangwane South Council Ward and Mfi Gilbert Nkhukhu representing the Mathangwane North council ward. In 2007, Mr. Ipuseng Chikanda won the by-election of the Mathangwane North Council ward for the BDP following the passing of Mr. Gilbert Nkhukhu.Why opposition parties lost Mathangwane =Upsets= With known village political trend, BDP council candidates fiercely contested their party primary elections with the knowledge that a win guaranteed individuals seats at the Council Chambers.Tonota-North has been regarded as a safe haven for the ruling party Mr. Ookame Ntobedze was defeated by the Botswana Congress Party (BCP) candidate, Mr. James Dlamini in the Mathangwane South Council Ward and Mr. Ipuseng Chikanda was defeated in the Mathangwane North council ward by Mr. Kenosi Mabalane also from the BCP in the 2009 General Elections marking the first ever BDP defeat in the village. This surprise defeat of the BDP council candidates led to a major campaign in the village in 2010 following the passing of Mr. Baledzi Gaolathe for the Tonota-North Parliamentary by- elections which BDP won.The Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) has retained the Tonota North parliamentary seat Opposition parties later accused the ruling party (BDP) of using government resources including public media in their party campaigns and at the same time opposing funding of political parties by government. The BCP's council surprise victory in the village was viewed as a significant breakthrough in a historical BDP stronghold and opposition parties made an unofficial pact in surpport of the BCP's Tonota-North Parliamentary candidate, Dr. Habaundi Njiro Hobona during the 2010 Parliamentary by- election.Hobona has a chance in Tonota North =BDP comeback;- 2014 General Elections= Shashe-West Constituency was re-subdivided into new Council Wards leading to the Mathangwane North and Mathangwane South Council Wards being merged to form a single but smaller ward called Mathangwane Council Ward to be contested for in the following elections.Shashe-West Constituency Representatives During the 2014 General Elections, Mr. Nehemiah Gerald Hulela of the BDP defeated Mr. Kenosi Mabalane of the BCP who had won one of the former constituent wards in the 2009 General Elections. On 25 November 2018, Hon. Nehemiah Gerald Hulela passed on, becoming the fourth Mathangwane Ward seating Councillor to be deceased in twenty years. =Lead-up to the 2019 Botswana General ElectionsThe 2019 Botswana general elections, early arrival!= In an effort to gain political mileage, the ruling BDP's area MP, Hon. Fidelis Mmilili Molao visited villagers in Shashe-West Constituency addressing Kgotla meetings accompanied by the Minister of Transport and Communications announcing that the long-awaited Mmandunyane-Shashe Mooke- Borolong-Chadibe-Mathangwane road construction will begin early 2019. The total distance of the road has now been increased to 82 km and is to include road links to Makobo and Natale villages. The reasons for suspending the road construction earlier after 2007 has been changed by the two ministers from the original statement of averting the impact of the 2008 global recession to now being due to the high number of homesteads which were supposed to be relocated to pave way for the road.Mandunyane-Mathangwane road to cost P750 million Two former Village Development Committee (VDC) volunteers will be contesting for the village political Council seat under the Botswana Democratic Party and Umbrella for Democratic Change continuing the village tradition where the VDC has long been converted into a political tool. Industry The area around Mathangwane consists of crop and cattle farmland. There are also a number of poultry and vegetable farms who supply Francistown and the local market. Mathangwane does not have a major shopping center but has a cluster of shops and bars mostly along the Francistown-Nata main road, selling clothes, fast food, alcohol, building materials to car and bicycle parts. There are also a number of hair salons that boom around Christmas time specialising in afro- styles. The most stable are a few brick molding entrepreneurs who specialise in pressed concrete bricks and supply locals for individual house construction developments. Trade services such as metal-smiths, plumbing, bricklaying, and electrical installation are supplied by individuals, in a largely unregulated trade. Just like other villages in the proximity of a city, Mathangane Villagers has a potential to drive their economy from real estate and construction trade. The Village has recently attracted influx of people working in Francistown looking for rented accommodation and outright property purchases; this resulted in a rapid property appreciation in the Village. There is, however, been little growth in the number of job creation. High rates of crime have become a disincentive to permanent settlement and micro business sector growth in the village.Choppers will boost war on crime - Tsimako Sports Football is the most popular sport in Mathangwane. The village, like other villages of Botswana hosts an annual Festive Football Tournament which starts on 25 December during Christmas with group opening matches.Festive soccer spectacles return bigger The tournament consists of two groups of five teams participating in a round-robin tournament in which each team is scheduled to play four matches against other teams in the same group. This means that a total of ten matches are played within a group. Points are used to rank the teams within a group with three points awarded for each win, one point awarded for each draw and zero points for all losses. The group winners and runners-up progress to the knockout stage. The knockout games are played in one day, normally on New Year's Day with the winner of each group playing against the runner-up from the other group in the morning followed by losers' final game in the afternoon. The losers' final game determines the tournament's third and fourth positions winners and also doubles up as a curtain raiser match for the final game which determines the tournament champions. The Mathangwane Festive Football Tournament normally attracts sponsorship from individuals and companies who contribute towards price monies to be presented to the players and teams for accomplishments including for awards other than those for the final team positions in the tournament. All top achievers in the tournament are presented with trophies while three top teams members' are each given medals being winners' (gold), runners-up' (silver), and third-place (bronze). The tournament champions also receive the tournament trophy which they keep and return prior to the start of opening matches of the following year's Festive Football Tournament. Members of the community are charged entrance fees to access the playing ground used for the Festive Football Tournament with small vendors paying more. The money collected at the playing ground entrance is mostly used for tournament logistics including payingoff referees, assistant referees, match commissioners and a private security guard services company which is only engaged for one day for the final games on New Year's Day. For all other games, security is manned by participating teams' representatives nominated by each team prior to the start of the tournament. The tournament normally uses a single playing ground for a single Festive Football Tournament averaging four matches a day with a small rest break to allow for games to continue into the last weekend of the year.

History / Military Use Named in honor of Muskogee native Jack Davis, who was killed in action in the South Pacific in World War II, Muskogee-Davis Regional Airport was previously known as Davis Field and prior to that, Muskogee Army Airfield, a U.S. Army Air Forces installation. Built in 1941–42 by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the War Department, the initial runway was constructed by commandeering a straight stretch of U.S. Highway 64. The facility was leased by the U.S. government in October 1942 to serve as a Ground Air Support Base to nearby Camp Gruber. It was also used as a combat crew training site for aerial photographic reconnaissance during World War II. The government lease for wartime use was terminated on August 15, 1947.http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=DA016 Muskogee- Davis Regional Airport was leased again by the U.S. government in December 1956 for use as an Air Force Reserve installation. In early 1957, the 65th Troop Carrier Squadron (65 TCS) of the Air Force Reserve (AFRES) was stationed at Davis Field, operating C-119 Flying Boxcar transport aircraft for Tactical Air Command (TAC) operations. The 929th Troop Carrier Group (929 TCG) of the Air Force Reserve was later established at Davis Field on 11 February 1963 as the headquarters for the 65 TCS, along with group headquarters, a Combat Support Squadron, Materiel Squadron and a Tactical Infirmary to support the 65 TCS. The group mission was to organize, recruit and train Air Force Reserve personnel in the tactical airlift of airborne forces, their equipment and supplies and delivery of these forces and materials by airdrop, landing or cargo extraction systems. The group was one of three C-119 groups assigned to the 403d Troop Carrier Wing (403 TCW) in 1963, the others being the 927th Troop Carrier Group, at Selfridge Air Force Base, Michigan and the 928th Troop Carrier Group at O'Hare International Airport, Illinois. In 1963, the group moved US troops to the Dominican Republic and airlifted Christmas gifts destined for US servicemen in Vietnam. Reassigned to the 433d Troop Carrier Wing (443 TCW) at Kelly Air Force Base, Texas in 1964, the 929th, however, remained at Davis Field. In November 1965, Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara announced that the 929th Troop Carrier Group would be moved from Davis Field because the facility was inadequate for the Air Force’s newer transport jets that the unit was expected to eventually transition to. Instead of being moved, the unit was instead inactivated on 1 July 1966 due to budget reductions caused by the cost of the Vietnam War. The closure which was completed the following June, affected 798 reservists, eight active duty and Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) personnel and 181 Air Reserve Technician (ART) civilians.Maurer, Maurer, ed. (1982) [1969]. Combat Squadrons of the Air Force, World War II (PDF) (reprint ed.). Washington, DC: Office of Air Force History. . pp. 247-248 At this point, control was returned to the local civilian government for use as a civilian airport. Today, in addition to its role as a civilian general aviation facility, Muskogee-Davis Regional Airport continues to be used by the USAF for transient training operations from Vance AFB, Altus AFB, Tinker AFB and Will Rogers Air National Guard Base.

Early career At some point in the early 1900s, Agar immigrated to the United States from his native England. In 1905, he founded his first team, Critchleys. In 1906, he was instrumental in the founding of the New York Amateur Association Football League. Agar was elected as the league's secretary, a position he held until at least 1911. He was also president of the league in 1910. In January 1909, Agar broke his leg while challenging for the ball. He remained with Critchleys until it folded following the 1912–13 season. He then played at least one season, 1916–17 with New York Clan MacDonald of the New York State Association Football League and at least one season, 1919–20 with Longfellows of the New York State League. =Referee= Agar also served as a referee for the New York Amateur Association League, being assaulted while officiating a game in April 1910.

The ASL was set for its first season and the Wanderers would play at Hawthorne Field, a dedicated soccer facility owned by Agar. Agar also chose to manage the team and played several games during the team's first two seasons. In 1926, Hakoah Vienna, one of the top Austrian teams toured the U.S. The team was composed entirely of Jews, many of whom were favorably impressed with the United States. Agar, who was also Jewish, immediately began negotiations to sign the players and in December 1926, brought the several Hakoah stars to the Wanderers. Despite the additional talent, the Wanderers remained a mid-table team for much of its existence. Southern New York State Football Association During the Soccer War, the USFA brokered the creation of the Eastern Soccer League composed of three teams suspended from the American Soccer League as well as several teams from the Southern New York State Football Association. The SNYFA considered the ESL to be encroaching on its territory, and, when the association president, Dr. Manning, resigned, Agar was elected in his place. Agar then led the SNYFA in leaving the USFA and allying itself with the ASL against the USFA.

In addition, \\"Jukebox radio\\" was heard on a Full Power Class A FM station, WJUX-FM 99.7 from Monticello, New York from 1995 until 2004. These two stations simulcast during that time period. In addition, 94.3 FM also simulcast Jukebox Radio from Rockland County, New York from 1996 to 2003. \\"Jukebox Radio\\" originally played Traditional Big Band Music in 1993, then evolved to more of an adult standrards format by 1995. \\"Jukebox Radio' evolved into Oldies in 1997. The station switched back to Adult Standards but emphasising more baby boomer pop in 2000. Due to legal issues, Jukebox Radio was forced to sell the stations in 2002 and today a Christian Teaching/Preaching/Praise & Worship Music format called \\"The Bridge occupy the dial positions. History Originally licensed as a Non-Commercial station \\"Jukebox Radio\\" hit the air on March 5, 1993 on FM translator 103.1 FM with DJs Lee Martin (Morning and Afternoon Drive), Matthew Borzi (Mid-days) and Larry Hopper (Evenings). The station was owned by Gerry Turro. Gerry Turro was the chief engineer of 1130 WNEW New York City from the 1980s until 1992 when WNEW folded. That station also had a big band/adult standards format from 1981 to 1992. Gerry purchased WNEW's music library at the end of 1992 for use on Jukebox Radio. Jukebox radio's music was originally a blend of traditional adult standards and big bands from the 1930s, 1940s and early 1950s. Core artists originally included Frank Sinatra, Tommy Dorsey, Mills Brothers, Peggy Lee, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Andrews Sisters, Artie Shaw, Bing Crosby, Duke Ellington, and others. The station, initially, only played a handful of songs newer than 1955 and sounded similar to the 1981 version of 1130 WNEW. In 1994, more easy listening artists such as Nat King Cole, Tony Bennett, Ray Charles, The Lettermen, Perry Como, Jerry Vale, pre-1970 Barbra Streisand, and others were added and Jukebox began playing more of the 1960s non rock songs but no baby boomer pop, except for a couple Ray Charles and Connie Francis songs, just yet. Jukebox Radio was non- commercial originally, each hour was underwritten by various sponsors. In 1995, WJUX was able to become a commercial station when leasing commercial airtime on 99.7 FM in Monticello, New York, which was nearly 100 miles away, becoming WJUX-FM. FM translator W276AQ, Fort Lee 103.1 in Bergen County became a translator station for WJUX. But what was unusual was that the station's studios and offices and announcers were all based in Bergen County. The station transmitted from the 103.1 frequency and sent the signal through digital phone circuits to WJUX-FM in Monticello which rebroadcast the signal to the north-western section of The Hudson Valley. At this point, Jukebox Radio became a commercial station. In the middle of 1995, Jukebox Radio began adding baby boomer pop to the format, playing about 4 or 5 per hour. Artists like Neil Diamond, Kenny Rogers, Dionne Warwick, Elvis Presley, Barry Manilow, Neil Sedaka, Brenda Lee, soft Beatles songs, Tony Orlando, Everly Brothers, and others. The station still continued to emphasise the Sinatra type artists and continued to feature some big band music as well. =Legal challenge= This radio station is famous in the broadcast radio industry, due to Gerry Turro (former chief engineer of WNEW, New York), who thought that he figured out how to legally operate an FM translator, commercially, in the #1 Market in the world, New York City. Unfortunately jealous nearby competition did not think it was legal. Miriam Warshaw and her husband Howard, owners of AM stand- alone station 1160 WVNJ filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming that Jukebox Radio's signal was illegal because the low power station was run as the main station while the full power station was a translator. Also since the signals had little if any overlap. WJUX 99.7 Monticello was receiving the signal from the Jukebox Radio studios through phone lines. The suit also claimed that 99.7 was designated to serve the Northwestern Hudson Valley and the southern Catskills and not Bergen County, but all its programming aimed at Bergen County and most of its advertisers were based out of Bergen County. WVNJ had an R & B Oldies format at the time WJUX went commercial in 1995, but switched to Adult Standards early in 1996 due to low ratings. Also, WJUX had an advantage being on FM, taking potential advertisers away from WVNJ. WVNJ thought that if they could get Jukebox off the air, they would have all the advertisers to themselves, they were wrong. Jukebox Radio won the first round of proceedings, but WVNJ appealed the decision to the Federal appellate court. WVNJ lost their appeal. Throughout 1997, Jukebox Radio began emphasising more baby boomer pop music. Big Band artists like Tommy Dorsey and old time crooners like Bing Crosby were gone. Artists like Frank Sinatra, The Lettermen, and Johnny Mathis would remain but now shared substantial airtime with songs by more baby boomer artists like Dion, Fats Domino, James Taylor, Paul Anka, Commodores, Kenny Loggins, The Association, Motown artists, and many others. By 1998 classic rockers like The Rolling Stones, The Doors, Billy Joel, Doobie Brothers and others were mixed in. Most of the pop standards staples were eliminated. Also, more Motown artists like Stevie Wonder, Four Tops, The Miracles, The Supremes, The Temptations, and others were added. By the spring of 1998, Jukebox Radio was a broad based oldies outlet focusing on the music of 1964 to 1979 with a sprinkling of big hits from the 1980s and the 1955-1963 era. =Format= Over the years, people such as Chuck Leonard, Jimmy Howes, Marty Wilson, Max Kinkel, Lee Arnold, Peter Vann, Bill Owen, Stan Martin, Mike Egan, Nick Straka, Bob Bober Harlin Jeffries, Bobby Ryan, and John Paul Morris worked at the Jukebox. John's weeknight program was broadcast live from 7 P.M. to 1:00 A.M. and a taped replay of each program was re-run until 6:00 A.M. In terms of selling advertising, Jukebox was very successful, doing over 1 million a year in billing. The oldies format did fairly well for the station. Chuck Leonard ( RIP ) is now in the Radio Hall of Fame and was the first African American DJ breaking the color barrier in New York City, working at 77-WABC Radio 1965-1979. Local News on Jukebox Radio was delivered by Mike Prelee (WNEW-AM) and David Matthau (son of Walter Matthau). In 2000, however, it was decided that Jukebox Radio would go back to adult standards but more of a hybrid of oldies and easy listening (sort of an MOR format...the way AC stations sounded in 1976). They would be more contemporary than their archrival WVNJ (which by then was not selling much advertising and now experiencing financial problems), but softer than an oldies station. Core artists included Sinatra, Bennett, Elvis, Neil Diamond, Simon & Garfunkel, The Lettermen, Tom Jones, Carly Simon, Andy Williams, and many others. =Legal conclusion= Unfortunately, legal battles continued. Due to the excessive legal fees forced upon Jukebox Radio, financial problems also began to occur in spite of the station otherwise being profitable. A compromise was reached that the station could stay on the air until it was sold to a non-commercial broadcaster. Since non-commercial broadcasters, have more lenient rules regarding translators, such a broadcaster could continue to run the license. As a result, Jukebox Radio was forced to sell the facilities to a non- commercial broadcaster due to these lawsuits and being buried with debt. Before going dark, Jukebox Radio was the most listened to radio station in New Jersey. In the last year, the station cut music time down to about 6 hours a day. The rest of the time was filled by infomercials. The station on 99.7 and the 103.1 translator was sold to a religious broadcaster. In November 2004, Jukebox Radio signed off for the last time and a religious format consisting of Praise & Worship Music, Christian Charismatic Preaching, Teaching, and features replaced Jukebox Radio. The station is known as \\"The Bridge\\" today. Also, the suit did oldies music fans little good. WVNJ has resorted to running infomercials in order to stay afloat and now plays little or no music.

The KESW Ltd. is the oldest and the only shipyard in Pakistan, catering for shipbuilding, ship repair and general heavy engineering. It has built numerous cargo ships, oil tankers, tugboats and support vessels, landing craft, naval vessels and submarines for the Pakistani Navy. The current Managing Director KS&EW; is Rear Admiral Ather Saleem.  History  It was established in mid fifties as a project of Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC) and was later incorporated as a public limited company in 1957 which is managed by a Board of Directors and a Managing Director. The shipyard is spread across 71 acres and located at west wharf in Karachi. It is equipped with a large shipbuilding hall, three block fabrication areas, three shipbuilding berths, two dry docks, a machine shop, a grit blasting and painting facility, a 7881 tons capacity ship lift and transfer system, 13 parking stations.  Projects  = 17,000 Ton Fleet Tanker = A contract was signed on 22 January 2013 between the Ministry of Defence Production, Pakistan and STM , Turkey to construct a 17000 ton fleet tanker for the Pakistani Navy. The Kit of Material was provided by STM and the construction, outfitting took place at KS&EW.; The construction of the vessel started on 27 November 2013 and it was launched on 19 August 2016. This is the largest warship built in Pakistan till date. =Agosta 90B= In the 1990s KS&EW; constructed two Agosta 90B submarines for the Pakistani Navy. These were built under a transfer of technology from DCNS, France. The technology was mostly related to construction of the pressure hull and out-fitting of the submarine. The third submarine, PNS Hamza, was constructed with MESMA AIP unit, while the first two (PNS Khalid and PNS Saad) will be retro-fitted during their next overhauls with a \\"plug\\" containing a MESMA AIP unit. The submarine's hull will be cut and the plug inserted. The second MESMA unit was shipped in June 2011.  Future Projects  The next submarine project will see KS&EW; jointly involved with Chinese company CSOC (China Shipbuilding & Offshore International Co. Ltd.) in the design and construction of 8 submarines equipped with air-independent propulsion (AIP). These will be designed to Pakistani specifications and four will be built at a CSOC shipyard in China, while four will be constructed by KS&EW.; It is believed that little upgrading of facilities is required because much of the current infrastructure meets the requirements. The preliminary negotiations were reported to be completed in March 2011. It was earlier believed that the project would involve China's Type-041 Yuan class submarine, which had been mentioned by Admiral Noman Bashir, Chief of Naval Staff, several times since 2009.

In its strict sense, it refers to the use of assemblages of fossils that are not tied to stratigraphic sections (in contrast to biostratigraphy, where they are). Collections of land mammal ages have been defined for every continent except Antarctica, and most are correlated with each other indirectly through known evolutionary lineages. A combination of argon–argon dating and magnetic stratigraphy allows a direct temporal comparison of terrestrial events with climate variations and mass extinctions.  Comparison with biostratigraphy  A golden spike marking the bottom of the Ediacaran Period, an example of an internationally agreed upon reference point for this boundary. In sedimentary rocks, fossils are the only widely applicable tool for time correlation. Evolution leaves a record of progressive change, sequential and nonrepeating. A rock unit has a characteristic assemblage of fossils, independent of its lithology. Thus, the fossils can be used to compare the ages of different rock units. The basic unit of biochronology is the biostratigraphic zone, or biozone, a collection of fossils found together in a rock unit. This is used as the basis of a biochron, \\"a unit of time in which an association of taxa is interpreted to have lived.\\" However, a biozone may vary in age from one location or another. For example, a given taxon may migrate, so its first appearance varies from place to place. In particular, facies-controlled organisms (organisms that lived in a particular sedimentary environment) are not well suited for biochronology because they move with their environment and may change little over long periods of time. Thus, biostratigraphers search for species that are particularly widespread, abundant, and not tied to particular sedimentary environments. This is particularly true of free-swimming animals such as benthic foraminifera, which readily spread throughout the world's oceans. Another challenge for stratigraphy is that there are often large gaps in the fossil record at a given location. To counter this, biostratigraphers search for a particularly well-preserved section that can be used as the type section for a particular biostratographic unit. As an example, the boundary between the Silurian and Devonian periods is marked by the first appearance of the graptolite Mongraptus uniformus uniformus in a section in Klonk, Czech Republic. In terrestrial deposits, fossils of land mammals and other vertebrates are used as stratigraphic tools, but they have some disadvantages relative to marine fossils. They are seldom evenly distributed through a section, and they tend to occur in isolated pockets with few overlaps between biozones. Thus, correlations between biozones is often indirect, inferred using a knowledge of their sequence of evolution. This practice was first proposed by H. S. Williams in 1941. In the United States, biochronology is widely used as a synonym for biostratigraphy, but in Canada and Europe the term is reserved for biochronology that is not tied to a particular stratigraphic section. This form of biochronology is not recognized by the International Stratigraphic Guide, but it is \\"really what a great many paleontologists and stratigraphers are after ... an optimum network of fossil correlations, thought to embody a reliable and high-resolution isochronous time (lines) framework.\\" Land mammal ages Skull of Bison antiquus from the La Brea Tar Pits. A Cenozoic chronology based on mammal taxa has been defined on all the continents except Antarctica. Because the continents have been separated through most of the Cenozoic, each continent has its own system. Most of the units are based on assemblage zones, layers of strata that contain three or more distinctive fossils. =North America= In 1941, a committee chaired by Horace E. Wood II compiled a list of 19 \\"provincial ages\\" for North America, later called North American Land Mammal Ages (NMLAs). An example of an NMLA is the Rancholabrean, named after the Rancho La Brea fossil site. One of its characteristic fossils is the bison, which first appears in the Rancholabrean. The committee tried to make the definitions unambiguous by providing multiple criteria such as index fossils, first and last occurrences, and the relation to a particular formation. Some of these criteria have turned out to be inconsistent, leading to conflict. For example, the Chadronian Land Mammal Age in the late Eocene was defined by the boundaries of the Chadron Formation in Nebraska as well as the co-occurrence of Mesohippus, an early horse, and titanotheres, a family of rhinoceros-like animals. Titanotheres have since been found above the Chadron Formation, leaving the definition of the age uncertain. Since NAMLs are not tied to stratigraphic sections, they are not true chronostratigraphic stages, so some authors place quotes around \\"Ages\\". =South America= The development of South American land mammal ages is largely due to two brothers, Florentino Ameghino and Carlos Ameghino. As of 1983, there were 19 ages, all but one of which were based on sections in Argentina. Since then three more ages have been added for the Paleocene. =Europe= The first European European land mammal age (ELMA), the Villafranchian, was defined in 1865. It was based on sedimentary units near Villafranca d'Asti in Italy. Several more were proposed between 1950 and 1975; and in 1975 Mein introduced a finer division called Mammal Neogene (MN) zones. A total of 30 Mammal Paleogene zones have also been defined. =Asia and Africa= Asian land mammal ages are more recently named and more tentative than the ages for the above continents, with poor geochronological constraints. There is no consensus for the names of some of the ages. However, the picture is rapidly improving, since Central Asia has some of the world's best records of Neogene mammals. In Africa, sequences of fossils (including those of primates) have been determined and some land mammal ages designated, but not yet formally defined. Other tetrapod-based biochronologies Land- mammal ages mostly represent intervals in the Cenozoic; they have not been proposed for the Mesozoic. However, related systems have been proposed for other periods of prehistory. Land-vertebrate \\"ages\\" (LVAs) based primarily on dinosaur faunas have been proposed for the late Cretaceous in western North America. The most widely utilized pre-Cenozoic tetrapod biochronology system involves Land vertebrate faunachrons (LVFs). The LVF system was originally designed by Spencer G. Lucas to correlate terrestrial faunal assemblages of the Triassic period. LVFs have also been used in Permian biochronology. Although LVFs are a common method used to date Triassic terrestrial sediments, their reliability is more heavily debated than that of Land Mammal Ages. Geochronology The order of evolutionary events that have been used to sequence land mammal records have been verified using geochronological methods. Although first and last occurrences of taxa can vary with location, assemblages show little variation. Fossils of mammals also have the advantage that the mammals have evolved rapidly. The resolution of terrestrial fossil records have improved as the methods have improved. Although K–Ar dating has largely yielded correct results, some needed revision after the advent of Argon–argon dating. Magnetic stratigraphy allows synchronization with the global magnetic polarity record resulting from reversals of the Earth's magnetic field. This has made it possible to correlate terrestrial sediments with the time scale from marine sediments, and compare them directly with global climate change and mass extinctions. Paleontologists have moved towards finer zonation of terrestrial fossils, with the potential to divide the Cenozoic into time intervals of 300,000 years or less. They have also attempted to convert some of the intervals, including the Wasatchian age/stage and Clarkforkian age/stage, into biostratigraphic units. However, the fossil record remains discontinuous even in North America, and Woodburne speculates that \\"mammal age correlations provide results that are satisfactory to their users.\\" References Category:Geochronological dating methods ","title":"Biochronology"},{"id":"14985480","text":"WLXK (88.3 FM) is a radio station broadcasting a Contemporary Christian format airs the K-LOVE programming format from Rocklin, California.

It is the sole survivor of four cinemas that once existed in the town. The Plaza has circle seating and stalls with Pullman seats throughout.  History  The Plaza is a traditional single screen cinema in the market town of Skipton, North Yorkshire. Designed by architect and engineer Jonathan Varley, it was built as a Temperance Hall in 1873, but was converted into a cinema in 1912. The Temperance Hall acquired its present ornate entrance in 1915 following its reopening as the Gem Picture Palace. In its early days it functioned as a music hall with films as part of the entertainment, then was acquired in the early 1920s by Matthew Hartley & Son. For three generations it stayed in the family, until it went up for sale in 1998 and was bought by Mr. Charles Morris to become a Northern Morris Cinema and operates alongside Leeds based cinema Cottage Road Cinema. > Our favourite story from the Plaza's long history concerns the management's > way of keeping rowdy youngsters in check in those long gone days.

A descendant of one of the oldest families of Lithuania and Samogitia, he took a special interest in the development of the industry and commerce of Poland and Lithuania, and to this end considered it of the utmost importance to utilize the energy and the abilities of the Jewish inhabitants. Together with Castellan Yezierski and other Liberal members of the \\"last\\" Polish Sejm, he endeavored to prove to the Polish representatives how harmful to the welfare of the country was the abnormal position of the Jews, and urged the taking of measures leading toward their emancipation. In 1789 he elaborated a plan for transforming the Jews into useful citizens, which he set forth in a pamphlet entitled Sposób Uformowania Zydów Polskich w Pozytecznych Krajowi Obywatelow (Warsaw), and which he submitted to King Stanislaus Poniatowsky at the session of the Diet of Dec. 4, asking the king to favor it with his support. In this pamphlet he points out that the Polish law did not include the Jews in the three estates of the realm (the nobility, country gentry, and burgesses); that the Polish legislation had always regarded the Jews as a foreign element, and, though burdening them with exceptional taxes, had not granted them the rights of citizens, while (he argues) Polish society had treated them with contempt, defamed their religion, and would not tolerate the notion that a Jew could be a son of his fatherland. He adds: > \\"And after all this, you demand from the Jew that he shall be useful to the > country which does not profess to be his father-land, that he shall be > faithful and devoted to those who constantly oppress him! The Jew did not > take to agriculture, because he did not care to exchange one kind of misery > for another; the law would not permit him to own land, and he had no desire > to become a serf and to work for others. He showed strong inclinations to > trade and industry; but the towns either would not admit him at all to these > pursuits, or at best allowed him to be only a haberdasher. It was a constant > struggle between the Jews and the Christian merchants: and therein lies the > cause of the decay of trade and the impoverishment of the towns.\\" When the Sejm appointed, in June, 1790, a committee \\"to reform the condition of the Jews,\\" Butrymowicz was one of its most active members. He pleaded in behalf of the inviolability of the Jewish faith, and of the union of \\"the peoples\\" (the Christians and the Jews) by the reception of the latter into the national organism through mutual concessions, through the abolition or the reorganization of the Kahal, and even through the influence of the courts in the propagation of education and culture among the Jewish youths.

Latour de France is situated by the original frontier between France and Catalonia and is rich in history. Its military significance ended with the Treaty of the Pyrenees peace between Louis XIV of France and Philip IV of Spain that ended the Franco-Spanish War of 1648–59 but is still evinced in street names such as place de l’hôpital and place d’Armes. This little village of approximately 1,000 inhabitants boasts its own Appellation Contrôlée associated with the forward-looking cave co-operative, a garage, pharmacy, post office, primary school, bakers, two restaurant / bars, a small grocery store and a blacksmith. There are two tennis courts, a skate park (new in 2018), a charming children's playground, and several locations used by petanque enthusiasts. At its perimeter, there is a mix of ancient and modern while the old central village is a labyrinth of narrow streets. While the Mairie has assiduously maintained and developed its many hidden small squares, the village has managed to remain unspoilt and authentic. Thirty years ago, in common with many villages, there were a fair number of derelict properties. These have virtually disappeared having been renovated for the most part by local families. Latour de France is now home to a growing number of foreign residents including families from Belgium, Britain, Germany and Norway. Those who are there have always found a real welcome and look on it as a little piece of heaven.

Shah is best known and remembered as the founder-president of the Indian Secular Society. The organization had its headquarters in Pune in Shah’s lifetime but has now shifted to Mumbai. Until his death, A. B. Shah was the editor of The Secularist, a journal published by the Indian Secular Society (ISS). He also the edited the New Quest published by the Indian Association for Cultural Freedom. Shah took much interest in the problems of Indian Muslims. Shah's writings include What Ails our Muslims? and Religion and Society in India. Shah also edited Jayaprakash Narayan's Prison Diary, written by the prominent Indian leader in jail during the Emergency of 1975. Professor Shah was a mathematician and a scholar, who became interested in comparative religion and social reform, leading to founding Indian Secular Society.  Biography  A. B. Shah was born in 1920 in a Digambar Jain family in Gujarat. As a result, he was an atheist even in his childhood. However, till the age of seventeen he was to some extent a practising Jain. Ernst Haeckel's The Riddle of the Universe and Hyman Levy's The Universe of Science convinced Shah that not only God but even soul did not exist. Jainism believes in the existence of soul. Shah was also influenced by M. N. Roy. Hamid Dalwai, the author of Muslim Politics in India was a friend of A. B. Shah. Shah started taking interest in Islam only after meeting Dalwai. Dalwai co-operated with Shah in founding Indian Secular Society and Muslim Satyashodhak Mandal. In 1973 Shah was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto. He was the Director of the Institute for the Study on Indian Traditions in Pune, Maharashtra at the time of his death in 1981.  Indian Secular Society  The Indian Secular Society is a non-political organisation, which works for promoting secular human values in Indian Society. Shah has paid much attention to Islam and to the problems of Indian Muslims in his works. Hamid Dalwai played an important role in the formation of the organization. The foundation-conference of ISS was presided by Prof. G.D. Parikh, who was an associate of M. N. Roy, a prominent Indian humanist of Twentieth Century. As elaborated by A.B. Shah himself, the Indian Secular Society works mainly at the level of ideas and communication. It has tried to document and discuss secularist and obscurantist trends in Indian society. Shah was also opposed to Hindu communalism. The ISS stands for the spirit of the Indian Constitution and the United Nations Charter of Human Rights. The organisation has published several books and booklets in English including those written by Shah himself.  Muslim Satyashodhak Mandal  In 1970, Hamid Dalwai and A.B. Shah, founded Muslim Satyashodhak Mandal in co- operation with the Indian Secular Society. This organisation provided a forum for secular Muslims for reforming and modernising Muslims in India. Dalwai was opposed to the notion that religion could help in encouraging modernisation and secularism. He considered \\"religious reformation\\" as an anachronistic concept. He wanted religion to be confined to its \\"proper sphere\\", that is, the personal relationship between the individual and his God. According to Dalwai, trying to justify social reform in the name of religion was counterproductive and would only strengthen those who were in a position to claim traditional authority to interpret the scriptures. Hence, Dalwai was in favour of making a clear distinction between religious revivalism camouflaged as a reform movement, and a renaissance based on reason and knowledge. Both Shah and Dalwai faced threats from conservative Hindus and Muslims for the reform-work they were doing.  Some publications of the Indian Secular Society  A. B.

A practical one- pot reaction that can be useful for the creation of disubstituted indoles. Most commonly tributyltin hydride is utilized as the reducing agent, with azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) as a radical initiator. Triethylborane can also be used as a radical initiator. The reaction can begin with either an ortho- isocyanostyrene or a 2-alkenylthioanilide derivative, both forming the indole through Radical cyclization via an α-stannoimidoyl radical. The R group can be a range of both basic and acidic sensitive functional groups such as esters, THP ethers, and β-lactams. In addition the reaction is not stereospecific, in that both the cis and trans isoform can be used to obtain the desired product. Fukuyama Indole Synthesis with either starting material. Mechanism The reaction mechanism begins with the creation of the tributyl tin radical with either AIBN or triethylborane, not shown in either step-wise mechanism. Following the radical attacks the o-isocyano carbon creating the alpha- stannoimidoyl radical. Through radical cyclization a five membered ring is formed followed by the propagation of a new tin radical. The final step is dependent on the desired outcome of the reaction. This reaction is a one-pot synthesis and results in yields ranging from 50% to 98% depending on the substituent. Step-wise mechanism of Fukuyama Indole Synthesis starting with the Isocyano substituent. The mechanism using 2-alkenylthioanilide is very similar, also starting with the formation of a bond, now between the tin radical and the sulfur. Followed by a similar radical cyclization resulting in a five membered ring, a new tin radical is produced and the original attacking radical leaves with the sulfur substituent. This part of the step-wise mechanism has yet to be detailed. The reaction yield can range from 40% to 93% depending also on the desired substituent. Step-wise mechanism of the Fukuyama Indole Synthesis starting with the alkenylthioanilide substituent. Derivatives The Fukuyama Indole synthesis can generate a range of different substituents at the 2,3 position that were previously unattainable without a protecting group on the nitrogen in the ring. One such example is the 2-iodoindole derivative, which can then lead to a variety of N-unprotected 2,3 substituted indoles. Before the discovery of this compound the chemistry involving 2-stannylindoles was not developed as there was no way to practically synthesis these N-unprotected 2,3-stannylindoles. One was limited to the production of N-protected 2-stannylindoles through metalation by a process known as Stille coupling. The N-unprotected 2-stannylindoles generated from the Fukuyama Synthesis can be readily oxidized with iodine opening up an area of chemistry that allows for the synthesis of a variety compounds utilizing the 2-iodoindoles as a starting reagent. This iodine substituted derivative can lead to aryl halides, vinyl iodides, vinyl triflates, benzyl bromides. Example Reaction for Fukuyama Synthesis. In addition to acetylenes (Sonogashira coupling), and acrylates (Heck reaction) in the second position. Possible next step synthesis reactions working with the 2-iodoindoles from the Fukuyama Synthesis. Applications The synthesis is one of the simplest methods for creating poly-substituted indoles, this procedure has been utilized in numerous natural product syntheses, including aspidophytine, vinblastine, and strychnine Shown below is the fourth step in the synthesis of (+)-Vinblastine, the application of the Fukuyama Indole synthesis to create a disubstituted indole.

Wise Bauer, The history of the medieval world: from the conversion of Constantine to the First Crusade, W. W.

According to one view, following Anonymus's description, the federation was called \\"Hetumoger\\" (Seven Magyars) (\\"VII principales persone qui Hetumoger dicuntur\\", \\"seven princely persons who are called Seven Magyars\\"Gyula Decsy, A. J. Bodrogligeti, Ural-Altaische Jahrbücher, Volume 63, Otto Harrassowitz, 1991, p. 99), though the word \\"Magyar\\" possibly comes from the name of the most prominent Hungarian tribe, called Megyer. The tribal name \\"Megyer\\" became \\"Magyar\\" referring to the Hungarian people as a whole.György Balázs, Károly Szelényi, The Magyars: the birth of a European nation, Corvina, 1989, p. 8Alan W.

The English term \\"Hungarian\\" is a derivative of the Latin \\"Ungri\\" or \\"Ungari\\" forms. History The Blood oath in Etelköz. According to András Róna-Tas the locality in which the Hungarians, the Manicha-Er group, emerged was between the Volga river and the Ural Mountains. Between the 8th and 5th centuries BC, the Magyars embarked upon their independent existence and the early period of the proto-Hungarian language began. Around 830 AD,Carl Waldman, Catherine Mason, Encyclopedia of European peoples, Volume 1, Infobase Publishing, 2006, p. 508 when Álmos was about 10 years old, the seven related tribes (Jenő, Kér, Keszi, Kürt-Gyarmat, ', Nyék and Tarján)Kevin Alan Brook, The Jews of Khazaria, Rowman & Littlefield, 2009, pp. 163-164. formed a confederation in Etelköz,Paul Lendvai, The Hungarians: a thousand years of victory in defeat, C. Hurst & Co. Publishers, 2003, p. 15-29, p. 533 called \\"Hétmagyar\\" (\\"Seven Magyars\\"). Their leaders, the Seven chieftains of the Magyars, besides Álmos, included Előd, Ond, Kond, Tas, Huba and Töhötöm, who took a blood oath, swearing eternal loyalty to Álmos.http://www.kislexikon.hu/hetmagyar.html (Hungarian) Presumably, the Magyar tribes consisted of 108 clans.John P. C. Matthews, Explosion: the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, Hippocrene Books, 2007, p. 69 The confederation of the tribes was probably led by two high princes: the kende (their spiritual ruler) and the gyula (their military leader). The high princes were either elected by the leaders of the tribes or appointed by the Khagan of the Khazars who had been exerting influence over the Magyars. Around 862 AD the seven tribes separated from the Khazars. Before 881 AD three Turkic tribes rebelled against the rule of the Khagan of the Khazars, but they were suppressed. After their defeat they left the Khazar Empire and voluntarily joined the Hétmagyar confederation. The three tribes were organised into one tribe, called Kabar, and later they played the roles of vanguard and rear guard during the joint military actions of the confederation. The joining of the three tribes to the previous seven created the On-ogur (Ten Arrows), one of the possible origins for the name Hungarian. Social organization The Hungarian social structure was of Turkic origin.Makkai 2001, pp. 415-416.

Church St Mary's Church in the centre of Chapel Lawn was designed by Edward Haycock Snr in the lancet style and erected in 1844. It was planned to provide 232 sittings, of which 162 were declared free and unappropriated forever. Originally a Chapel of Ease of Clun parish, without an adjoining vicarage and resident priest, it was built to save parishioners the long walk to Clun. Built of stone in the style of the period, it displays the typical plain lancets, flat buttresses, and western bell gable with a wide queen post roof. The polygonal apse, which forms the chancel, is unusual. The church contains war memorials in the form of a brass plaque listing local men who died serving in World War I and a stone plaque to the only man to die serving in World War II, John H.P. Adams.

Geography  Opoul-Périllos is located in the canton of La Vallée de l'Agly and in the arrondissement of Perpignan. Map of Opoul-Périllos and its surrounding communes The commune's highest point, Montoliu de Perellós (707 meters, a summit located next to the river Aude), stands as the northernmost point in Catalan-speaking countries. Opoul-Périllos spreads over a large area of 5,053 hectares (12,486 acres). In its present form it dates from January 1, 1972, when both villages where integrated into one single commune (Perellós, a tiny hamlet located some 10 km up into the mountain, had been virtually deserted since the end of World War II, the 1968 census returning just 4 inhabitants). The area is dominated by limestone with numerous karst (caves, crevices, sinkholes). The village lies in a depression where the limestone is mixed with red clay. The town is crossed from north to south by Ròbol, a tributary of the Aglí river. The main (and almost, only) crop is the vineyard. Etymology The village of Opoul is mentioned as Oped at about 1100, and as Opidum in 1149. These repeated spellings leave no doubt about the etymology: Òpol derives from oppidum, Latin for \\"fortress\\". However, the transition from Oped to Òpol (Opulo and Castell d'Òpol on the 13th and 14th centuries, respectively) is rather surprising. It would be logical to assume *Opedol as a diminutive form of Oped, which could have designated a small castle in the village as opposed to the fortress which dominates it (it is worth mentioning that the medieval fortress overlooking the village has been known as \\"castell de Salvaterra\\" from the 13th century onwards (salvaterra being Catalan for \\"safe land\\", \\"asylum place\\"). Périllos is also mentioned in 1100 (Perelons), then Perillons and Perellons in the 13th century. The current spelling started to be used during the following century and guards no relation with the Catalan adjective for \\"dangerous\\" (perillós). Perellós is generally assumed to be a place where perelloner\\"Perelloner\\" on the 'Diccionari de la llengua catalana' Barcelona: Institut d'Estudis Catalans (Catalan for \\"wild pear tree\\" or \\"dogwood tree\\", amelanchier ovalis or pyrus spinosa species) grows. However, the hypothesis of a \\"stony place\\" (pedregós in modern Catalan) cannot be totally ruled out. Demography  Opoul's population was 135 fires (focs) in 1365, no more than 150 inhabitants (A foc was a medieval Catalan census measure for hearth tax purposes: 35 focs would amount to approximately some 150 inhabitants). Doubtlessly affected by great plagues and wars, population was down to 3 fires by the early 16th century. It was during the 19th century that population growth reached its peak, bolstered by a lower mortality rate and the development of viticulture: 701 inhabitants in 1836, 1157 in 1886. Then, the rural exodus and the Great French Wine Blight crisis led to a fairly sharp drop: there were just 702 inhabitants in 1926, 570 in 1946, with an all-time low of 482 inhabitants in 1975. The situation has improved over the last 30 years, and there were 595 inhabitants in the 2005 census. As for Périllos, a village virtually cut off from the world, its decline was inevitable: after reaching a peak of 85 in 1861, population fell to 8 people in 1946, the last birth being registered in 1916. At the time of its aggregation to Opoul (1972), the village was already deserted.

A specialist sprinter he ran eleven times between June 1989 and October 1990 and won seven races. In 1990 he dominated European sprinting, winning the King's Stand Stakes' the Nunthorpe Stakes, the Ladbroke Sprint Cup and the Prix de l'Abbaye de Longchamp. On his final racecourse appearance he finished second to Safely Kept in the Breeders' Cup Sprint. The Racing Post called him \\"the world's fastest horse\\". Background Dayjur is a dark brown horse standing 15.3 hands bred in Kentucky by Georgia E. Hofmann. He was sired by Danzig out of the American Champion Sprinter Gold Beauty. As a yearling he was bought for $1.65m by Hamdan Al-Maktoum and sent to be trained in England. Dayjur was trained by Dick Hern at West Ilsley in Berkshire. He was ridden in all his races by the veteran Scottish jockey Willie Carson. Racing career =1989: two-year-old season= Dayjur made his first racecourse appearance in the six furlong Kennett Maiden Stakes at Newbury on 15 June. He started the 8/15 favourite against thirteen opponents and won \\"easily\\" by a length. A month later he was moved up in class for the Listed Manton Rose Bowl Stakes over the same course and distance. He started 8/13 favourite but was beaten half a length by the Clive Brittain-trained Rushmore. At the end of the year he was given a \\"Hobday\\" operation to improve his breathing. =1990: three-year-old season= Spring In the spring of 1990, Dayjur was aimed at the 2000 Guineas, but ran disappointing in his trial race, finishing seventh of the ten runners in the European Free Handicap over seven furlongs at Newmarket. He was moved back down to six furlongs and won a minor race at Nottingham before being beaten a head by Tod in a similar event at Newbury. Ten days after his disappointing run at Newbury, Dayjur contested his first Group Race when he was pitted against more experienced sprinters in the five furlong Temple Stakes at Sandown Park Racecourse. On this occasion, Carson allowed the colt to lead from the start and he won by two lengths without being seriously challenged. Summer In June, Dayjur was sent to Royal Ascot for the five furlong King's Stand Stakes, which was then a Group Two race. Hern was concerned about the soft ground, but Hamdan Al Maktoum insisted on running him. Dayjur led almost from the start and drew clear in the final two furlongs to beat the French colt Ron's Victory by two and a half lengths, with a gap of six lengths to the rest of the field. In September, Ron's Victory won the Diadem Stakes by ten lengths. In August, Dayjur was made 8/11 favourite for the Group One Nunthorpe Stakes at York, with the King George Stakes winner Argentum the only horse seriously supported against him. Once again, Carson allowed him to lead from the start and Dayjur pulled away in the closing stages to win by four lengths in a course record time of 56.16. The Racing Post described the performance as \\"very impressive\\". Autumn In September, Dayjur was moved back up to six furlongs for the Ladbroke Sprint Cup at Haydock Park. He started the 1/2 favourite against a field which included the July Cup winner Royal Academy and the Prix Maurice de Gheest winner Dead Certain. Dayjur led from the start, went clear inside the final quarter mile and held the late challenge of Royal Academy to win by one and a half lengths. In October, Royal Academy won the Breeders' Cup Mile. On his final European start, Dayjur contested the Prix de l'Abbaye at Longchamp Racecourse in Paris. Only five horses appeared to oppose him and he led from the start before winning by two lengths. He was eased down in the closing stages and lost some ground when appearing to jump a shadow cast across the course. During his final race, the 1990 Breeders' Cup Sprint at Belmont Park, Dayjur overcame a difficult wide draw and after bitterly contesting the lead with Safely Kept, had got on top and looked set for a famous victory. However, in the closing seconds of the race, Dayjur jumped a dark shadow cast over the track - and another at the line - allowing the filly to claim victory by a neck. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Dayjur the best racehorse foaled in 1987 and the fifth best British sprinter of the twentieth century behind Abernant, Irish Elegance, Pappa Fourway and Tetratema. Stud career He retired to the Shadwell Racing farm in Kentucky of his owner Sheikh Hamdan Al-Maktoum, from where he has sired several good winners like Tipsy Creek (Temple Stakes), Hayil and Millstream (Cornwallis Stakes). On January 18, 2010 it was announced that Dayjur had been retired from stud duty. On 25 September 2013 Dayjur was euthanized Shadwell \\"due to the infirmities of old age\\".

Geography The village is built on a polje of limestone and dominated by a vast Karst landscape. This polje lies on a syncline generally known as the \\"Plateau de Vassieux\\". The Plateau de Vassieux is the site of numerous other karst phenomena, such as limestone pavements and caves, which are studied and explored by local speleology groups. History Cemetery and memorial Vassieux-en-Vercors is home to several prehistoric archaeological sites, and has a Museum of Prehistory which was created in May 1970 after the discovery of a flintknapping workshop. In June and July 1944, during the Second World War, the French Resistance, known as the Maquis du Vercors, staged a major uprising against the German occupation in Vercors and proclaimed the Free Republic of Vercors. It was the first democratic territory in France since the beginning of the German occupation in 1940 - the revolt was brutally suppressed. For its great acts of resistance the town was awarded the Ordre de la Libération. A memorial was built at the Col de la Chau to remember the grim events of the Second World War, and includes a cemetery where the victims of a July 1944 German massacre are buried.

It was the home of the Toledo Mud Hens and their predecessors from 1897 until mid-season 1909 when Swayne Field opened. Armory Park is the first Toledo ballpark for which any photograph is known to survive. The various sources listed herein give somewhat different descriptions of the ballpark's location. The clearest description is provided by the book Baseball in Toledo, which includes a \\"bird's-eye-view\\" (p. 20) of the downtown area, including the Armory and the ballpark. This illustration is not contemporary, but is a reconstruction drawn in 1943. That book does not give specific dimensions, but states that right field was so short that fly balls hit over the fence in that area were ground- rule doubles. The Armory itself was on the south corner of Spielbusch Avenue (to the northwest, the portion of the road later renamed Judge Joseph Flores Avenue) and Orange Street (to the northeast). The next street southwest was Beech Street. The lot between Beech and the Armory was the location of the ballpark, precisely where the current U.S. District Courthouse now stands. The ballpark and the rest of the Armory property were bounded on the southeast by North Ontario Street. When the land was redeveloped for the government complex, Beech and Ontario were removed as public streets in that area, resulting in the larger block now bounded by Speilbusch, Orange, North Erie Street (southeast) and Jackson Street (southwest). The Lucas County Courthouse is across Jackson to the southwest. The home plate / grandstand area of the ballpark was tucked into the Spielbusch-Beech corner, with the lot being otherwise surrounded by a board fence, except for the left field area, whose high masonry wall was actually the rear wall of the Armory building. This is visible in the photograph in the external link. This venue immediately replaced one of the two previous Toledo ballparks, Ewing Street Park. Weekend games continued to be played at Bay View Park through the 1900 season. For the next 8½ seasons, Armory Park was the Mud Hens exclusive home. The final game at Armory Park was played on July 2, 1909, the day before Swayne Field's debut. (Toledo Baseball Guide, p. 98) The Armory building itself was destroyed by fire in 1934, in connection with rioting in the Auto-Lite strike.

The firm of Bakri & Busnash soon attained a wide reputation, and Busnash became (according to some) the most influential man in Algeria. In 1800 he was appointed by the dey Mustapha—whom he had helped to attain to power—chief of the Algerian Jews, a post to which was attached the office of broker to the dey, and the consul-generalship of Ragusa. In this position Busnash displayed so much ability that he won the entire confidence of the dey, who practically left the government in his hands. It was he who received the consuls and settled differences between Algeria and foreign countries. His power did not, however, last. The Janissaries and Muslim extremists reluctantly submitted to the domination of a Jew; but Busnash, after having escaped several attempts on his life, was at last shot dead by a janissary at the gate of the dey's palace.

His paternal grandfather was Philip Philip Livingston (1741–1787), who was born in colonial New York and had settled in Jamaica, West Indies prior to the Revolutionary War, therefore remaining a British subject.

The series started on October 27, 2006 on the Turkish TV channel ATV, aired on Friday evenings at 22:15 hrs local time. After 68 episodes, the final one was aired on June 6, 2008. Plot The series tells the story of the love between Yasemin and Ahmet, two young people from opposing families, and the relationship between their relatives and friends in the political era starting at the end of the 1950s in Turkey. In the background, historical events are depicted, beginning with Prime Minister Adnan Menderes' 1959 plane crash survival followed by the 1960 military coup, the trial on Yassıada, the executions and other important incidents that generated the radical political polarization of Turkish society afterwards. Yasemin and Ahmet's fathers, Rıza and Şevket, who are childhood friends and neighbors, develop opposite political views as they grow up. Rıza becomes a member of the right wing Democratic Party and enters parliament while Şevket, a public prosecutor, is a follower of the leftist Republican People's Party. Riza's older daughter Yasemin falls in love with Şevket's son Ahmet, however, their families do not allow them to marry and force them to separate. Things become complicated when Yasemin discovers that she is carrying Ahmet's baby. Their mutual friend Necdet tries to help Yasemin by offering to marry her and pretending to be the father of the baby. The unconsummated marriage between Yasemin and Necdet forces Yasemin and Ahmet apart. During their separation, Necdet's act of kindness takes on a new role as he begins to fall in love with Yasemin. Her feelings for Necdet become complicated because her heart still belongs to Ahmet. Years later Yasemin and Ahmet meet by chance again on a train. Ahmet meets Rüya, Yasemin's daughter, and wishes she were his own daughter. Ahmet tries to reconcile with Yasemin when he discovers how both families intervened to split them up but Yasemin refuses. He suggests she runs away with him but she cannot betray Necdet after all he has done for her. So Ahmet carries on alone, later becoming engaged to Ayla and working as a teacher in the same university in which Yasemin is teaching Arts. At the end of the first season Ahmet discovers that he is the father of Yasemin's daughter Rüya; he feels betrayed and disappointed by Yasemin, and sues Yasemin and Necdet to get custody of his daughter. During the trial, many truths are discovered which attenuate Ahmet's anger. As the series proceeds various dramatic events take place, in Turkey and in the lives of the characters. The political history of Turkey from 1971 to the military coup in 1980 is portrayed, from the point of view of the two families, who eventually resolve their differences.
