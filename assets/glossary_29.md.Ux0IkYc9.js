Life Vukac was born in the second half of the 14th century, the second son of Hran Vuković Kosača; the younger brother of veliki vojvoda (Grand Duke) of Hum, Sandalj Hranić (l. 1370–1435), and older brother of knez Vuk Hranić (d. 1424). Both Vukac and Vuk were subordinate to their powerful older brother Sandalj, who governed a large independent territory in the Kingdom of Bosnia. Sandalj had succeeded their uncle Vlatko Vuković in 1392. Vukac held part of his family's hereditary lands in Podrinje (mentioned in 1415), and the region of Govza by the Bistrica river and the town of Jeleč which he was given following the death of his younger brother Vuk in 1425. He married Katarina (d. 1456), whose origin is deemed unknown, in August 1403. With Katarina he had two children, a son, Stjepan, and a daughter, Teodora, who married Radoslav Pavlović (1420–41). Stjepan was since 1419 mentioned in documents alongside his father and uncles as he had already back then been chosen to succeed Sandalj in the future. The Republic of Ragusa granted Sandalj, Vukac, Vuk and Stjepan the status of Ragusan nobility and senators and an estate in Ragusa (Dubrovnik) by charter dated June 29, 1419. Vukac was actively part of the peace talks between the Kingdom of Bosnia and the Republic of Ragusa in 1405. During the peace talks between dukes Radoslav Pavlović and Sandalj, besides the Ragusans, Vukac actively participated working for peace (he was Sandalj's brother and Radoslav's father-in-law). Peace was concluded on February 1, 1423. In February 1425, Brailo Tezalović and Vukac arrived at Ragusa to once again start talks about the sale of Radoslav Pavlović's part of Konavle to the Republic of Ragusa. After the sale of eastern Konavle by Radoslav to the Republic of Ragusa in 1426, Vukac and Radoslav Obradović received 200 ducats each. Vukac died in 1432. His son Stjepan succeeded as the chief of the Kosača family following the death of Sandalj in 1435. Family He married Katarina (d. 1456), of unknown origin, in August 1403. He had two children, a son and a daughter: *Stjepan Vukčić Kosača, vojvoda *Teodora Vukčić, married Radoslav Pavlović (1420–41) It is possible that Vukac had another son, Isa-Beg Isaković, the first governor of Ottoman Bosnia (1450s–60s).

The product gives broadcasters the opportunity to publish real-time in-tweet video clips that are accompanied by pre-roll or post-roll advertisements. It is Twitter's major initiative in social television, designed to enhance the user experience with premium and timely TV highlights, enable broadcasters to reach new audiences and provide brands with a cross-platform tool for reaching the social conversation around major events. Twitter Amplify allows the social network to profit further from the growth in digital video advertising, which is growing many times faster than TV, search, and most other digital ad markets. Online video ad revenue will reach nearly $5 billion in 2016, up from $2.8 billion in 2013, while TV ad revenue will decline by nearly 3% per year during the same time period. Analysis by Credit Suisse puts the average cost per thousand impressions (CPM) for a digital video advertisement at $24.60 rising up to $32.80 for those with interactive ad units or mobile formats - versus $2.66 for display formats. Mechanics Twitter Amplify allows broadcasters and rights holders to share live TV clips and video content into Twitter in real-time, giving users the opportunity to watch the social videos without leaving Twitter. For instance, if a television company purchased time on the platform, it can promote its prime-time shows and earn advertising revenue at the same time. During a show's broadcast, Twitter Amplify can send a barrage of tweets with rich media and interactive contents such as video clips and audience polls to drive people to the program. The content could include sponsor messages in the form of pre-roll ads. It is also a viral video format as Twitter users retweet their favourite clips and push them out to their own followers, extending the reach of the videos more broadly. Twitter Amplify also allows content owners to use paid media support from sponsors and advertising partners to fund the distribution of their content across Twitter. =Discovery and distribution= One of the challenges when distributing (and consuming) video on Twitter is that many consumers have fast feeds. Twitter Amplify makes it possible to pin the social video tweet to the visible part of the feed so the user is more likely to see it and engage with it. Moreover, if a broadcaster sends a tweet from its own Twitter account, it can target only the people that are following that account (i.e. its \\"organic reach\\"). However, when a sponsor runs a paid campaign with Twitter Amplify, it can also target anyone tweeting about that topic or content at that time, or any other user who may be interested in the content (because they have followed a relevant account, tweeted against a particular hashtag or discussed an associated topic in their feed) - rather than being restricted to its own Twitter followers. Broadcasters and rights holders can therefore ensure their video tweets are seen and use paid media distribution (Twitter Amplify) to extend this reach to a much wider and relevant demographic. This audience can be many times the size of their existing, organic reach – potentially the entire audience of Twitter. =Extending viral distribution= Paid media Amplify campaigns encourage extended viral video distribution as Twitter users (that do not follow the broadcaster or rights holder directly) discover these new video tweets in their feed, pushed to them via promoted tweets, and share them with their own followers. This drives a second wave of viral distribution and greater earned media value for the broadcaster and brand. =Ad-funded distribution= By enabling broadcasters to have this extended social reach paid for by a brand sponsor – one that wants to align itself with the premium content and push its campaign message across social platforms – Twitter Amplify represents an ad- funded distribution model for content.  Partners  When it was launched, Twitter also announced it would work with a number of media companies, including Time Inc., Bloomberg Television, Discovery Channel, Vevo, Vice Media, Condé Nast Entertainment and Warner Music Group. By February 2014, all four major U.S. TV networks had signed up to the Amplify program, bringing a variety of TV content onto the social platform, in the form of real-time video clips. In March 2014, ITV became the first major broadcaster in the UK to sign up to Twitter Amplify and BSkyB followed suit in October 2014, having been sharing video on the platform since 2013. At this time, Twitter Amplify was live in 10 countries and had more than 70 partners including the BBC. Twitter and its media partners are believed to be making significant revenue from its Twitter Amplify program. According to an industry source, McDonald's, Verizon and Microsoft paid seven figures each to sponsor the NFL's Amplify videos and to promote the tweets. By bringing more premium content on its platform, it also hopes to drive growth of its user base. Twitter acquired its Twitter Amplify partner in the U.S., SnappyTV, as part of its ongoing efforts to be the leader in social television. The company was helping broadcasters and rights holders to share video content both organically across social and via Twitter's Amplify program. Twitter continues to work with London-based Grabyo, which has also struck numerous deals with broadcasters and rights holders to share video content across Facebook and Twitter. These include the NHL, Sky Sports, the Brit Awards, Wimbledon, FIFA World Cup, Channel 5, ATP World Tour, Ryder Cup, FIA Formula E Championship and UFC.  Recent developments  In 2016, Twitter expanded Amplify by opening it to individual publishers. Under this new feature, users can earn a portion of the revenue if they choose to include a pre-roll ad when sharing a video content. Initially, Twitter only allowed in-stream video ads to clips and livestreams to advertisers that have been white-listed via Twitter Amplify but in June 2018, this feature became open to all advertisers through the application's self-serve ad tool. By September of the same year, the company also began placing video contents and livestream atop Twitter users' timeline, giving them more prominent exposure.

It is situated in the Touarga commune of Rabat, the national capital. Its official name is the El Mechouar Essaid Palace, which means the venue of happiness palace. History Since the reign of sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah, the Alaouite sultans and kings have maintained a palace in Rabat. The current building was built in 1864, to replace the older palace, by Mohammed IV. Morocco had been formerly under the control of the French since 1912, and they wanted the sultan to be largely stationed in one place, near their own administrative headquarters, in order to show his acceptance of the new regime. Although kings had many residences at their disposal, when independence was declared in 1955, they chose to keep the Dâr-al-Makhzen palace as the main palace of the monarch. Some monarchs, particularly Mohammed V, preferred the smaller and relatively secluded palace of Dar es Salaam, further out of centre of the city, maintaining the Dâr-al-Makhzen as their official and administrative residence. Several important events in the lives of a number of Moroccan royals have taken place in the palace, including the birth of Hassan II in 1929 and the marriage ceremony of Mohammed VI and Salma Bennani in 2002. Design and Construction The front of the palace, facing on to the mechouar The palace sits at the end of the mechouar, a large parade ground also containing a small mosque. The mechouar is used for large public assemblies, such as the return from exile of Mohammed V in 1955. As well as living space for the king and the royal family, there is accommodation for the Moroccan Royal Guard. The palace complex also contains the Collège Royal, a school for senior members of the royal family, a cookery school, and a ground floor library built to contain the manuscript collection of Hassan II. There are extensive gardens and grounds surrounding the palace, the design of which was influenced by French formality, traditional Arabic motifs and local horticulture.

It commemorates the 26 May 1918 adoption of the Act of Independence, which established the Democratic Republic of Georgia in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917. It is the national day of Georgia. Independence Day is associated with military parades, fireworks, concerts, fairs, and political speeches and ceremonies, in addition to various other public and private events celebrating the history and culture of Georgia. Background In the chaotic aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917, Georgia, which had been part of the Russian Empire since the early 19th century, declared itself an independent Democratic Republic on 26 May 1918, after a brief and loose federative union with the fellow South Caucasian countries of Armenia and Azerbaijan. In February–March 1921 the Democratic Republic of Georgia fell to the invading Russian army and the country became a Soviet Socialist Republic, being annexed into the Soviet Union in 1922. Georgia seceded from the Soviet Union, adopting the Act of Reestablishment of Independence on 9 April 1991, on the second anniversary of the Soviet military crackdown on a large pro-independence rally in Georgia's capital of Tbilisi in 1989. Due to its symbolism and historical significance, 9 April has been advocated to be recognized as Independence Day by the groups associated with the 1980s national movement and the government of Zviad Gamsakhurdia, which presided over the declaration of independence on 9 April 1991. During their rule (October 1990 – January 1992), Gamsakhurdia's government had instituted 26 May as Independence Day; the 9 April 1991 declaration stated it was based on the 26 May 1918 Act of Independence. The preceding referendum on 31 March 1991 had also asked the citizens of Georgia whether they wanted independence to be restored on the basis of the 26 May 1918 declaration. Since 1993, 9 April has been observed as the Day of National Unity, Civic Concordance, and Remembrance in Georgia. History The second anniversary of Georgian independence. 26 May 1919. Georgian troops deployed in Iraq celebrate Independence Day in Baghdad on 26 May 2006 People posing at military hardware displayed in Tbilisi on 26 May 2014 26 May had been celebrated as the national day of the Democratic Republic of Georgia until the Soviet takeover in 1921. During the Soviet era, it was clandestinely and irregularly observed by segments of society opposed to the Communist regime. As the Georgian national movement gained momentum in the late 1980s, the symbols associated with the short-lived pre-Soviet republic became a rallying cry for those advocating independence from the Soviet Union. After Georgia's declaration of independence on 9 April 1991, the government set on 26 May 1991 Georgia's first presidential election, which was won by Zviad Gamsakhurdia. Georgia met 26 May of the next year with the new government led by Eduard Shevardnadze; Gamsakhurdia had been ousted in a military coup earlier that year. The 26 May 1992 celebration was attended by Shevardnadze's old acquaintance James Baker. The day also witnessed one of the first major anti-Shevardnadze demonstrations in the streets of Tbilisi. Through much of Shevardnadze's rule, Independence Day was a civilian observance. Since 1997, no military parades had been organized by the government, citing financial difficulties. Shevardnadze's successor as President of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, restored, in 2004, tradition of holding military parades, which was used as a venue to exhibit new equipment of the Georgian Armed Forces. 26 May 2004 saw the largest ever military parade in Georgia. During Saakashvili's second term of presidency, the Independence Day celebrations were overshadowed by political instability; in 2008 and 2009 large opposition rallies in central Tbilisi limited the scale of the celebrations and in 2011 an attempt by part of the opposition at obstructing a military parade planned for 26 May led to fatalities during a clash with police. After the Georgian Dream coalition acceded to power in 2012, a military component of the Independence Day celebration was limited to oath-taking ceremonies of Georgian soldiers and public exhibitions of military technology. =Notable anniversaries= * 26 May 1918 – The National Council of Georgia adopts the Act of Independence of Georgia. * 26 May 1920 – Leaders of the Second International attend the Independence Day demonstration in Tbilisi as part of their visit to Georgia. * 26 May 1921 – The new Bolshevik government of Georgia marks Independence Day to celebrate the sovietization of Georgia, barring the national flags of the overthrown Democratic Republic of Georgia from being displayed during the celebrations. * 26 May 1922 – Soviet security forces break up rallies to mark the Georgian Independence Day in Tbilisi and other places in the Georgian SSR. * 26 May 1989 – Pro-independence demonstrators gather in Tbilisi to mark Independence Day for the first time since 1922. * 26 May 1991 – Georgia holds its first presidential election.

The club currently fields six teams in the NSW Suburban Rugby Union competition, known as \\"Subbies\\". Hunters Hill was formed in 1892, and is amongst the oldest rugby clubs in Australia. The club aims to achieve a balance of success and camaraderie on and off the field as well as encouraging people all of ages and genders to enjoy their rugby.http://www.huntershillrugby.org.au/mainpage/2017/7/26/draw-released-for- womens-games As of 2017, Hunters Hill has won twelve Club Championships and forty one Premierships within the various divisions of the Subbies competition, including winning the trophy for the Division I premiership, the Kentwell Cup, eight times. History =Early years: 1892–1914= Hunters Hill RUFC was founded in 1892. Sydney club rugby in the early years was organised on two levels, known simply as Senior and Junior, where Junior denoted second tier teams, not the age of the players. A Senior club competition had been running since 1874, but Junior contests prior to the mid-1880s were somewhat disorganised. There was no formal competition for 'Junior' clubs until 1886 and matches were agreed by arrangement of the clubs (or between schools and clubs). The City and Suburban Association, formed in 1901, organised a competition for Junior clubs outside the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan and New South Wales Rugby Unions, and the Hunters Hill club joined this competition from at least as early as 1906. The club's present black and white hoops were adopted in 1907 but colours of dark blue and sky blue were used from the mid-1890s. =Subbies: 1919–1956= Following the re- establishment of New South Wales rugby in 1919 after the war, a new combined competition formed. Hunters Hill won the premiership for non-district clubs in 1919. At the beginning of the 1923 season, W.H. Kentwell, president of the Mosman Rugby Club, presented the Kentwell Cup perpetual trophy for what was effectively the first grade competition of the non-district clubs at the time. Eight teams competed in 1923 and the cup was won by Mosman with Hunters Hill as the runners-up. Hunters Hill played the finals in 1930 and 1932, and again in 1938 – but were not to win the Kentwell Cup until 1972. The club did however win the second grade finals of 1925 and 1926 for the G.B. Burke Cup. After the war, Hunters Hill won the G.B. Burke Cup again in 1955. The club won the H.W. Whiddon Cup for the third grade competition, in 1949, 1951, and 1955. The club fell away, however, and no senior rugby sides were fielded for nine seasons from 1957. Outside of the World Wars this was the senior club's only break of continuity, but the junior club had remained strong with up to ten teams playing. =Comeback and Golden era: 1966–1991= In 1966, Hunters Hill made a return to Subbies and over the next six years expanded from one senior team to three. The club won the Division II first grade in 1971 for the John Barraclough Cup (as well as the Reliance Shield club championship) and fielded four teams after promotion to Division I in 1972. Coached by former the NSW and Wallaby player John Francis, the club achieved immediate success by winning the Division I first grade premiership in 1972 for the Kentwell Cup. Through the 1970s and 1980s, Hunters Hill had a golden period in Division I, securing Kentwell Cup victories in 1972, 1977–79, 1981, and 1987. The club won the Bruce Graham Shield four times for the Division I Club Championship in 1977, 1979–81, and 1987. Eventually the club was relegated to Division II in 1991. =Centenary and regrowth: 1992 to 2010= Hunter's Hill undertook a recruitment drive to boost playing members ahead of the Club's centenary in 1992. In that season, the first grade team wore jerseys which incorporated the two blue colours from the 1900s. The Hunters Hill club also travelled to the Hong Kong Sevens tournament. In 1994, \\"The Cats\\" a team for over-35s was formed. The club gained promotion to Division I for the 1995 season. A colts team was also formed in 1995, and the club entered and won the NSW Sevens tournament. The Hunters Hill club moved up and down between divisions. The 1st Grade side tasted success in 1995 and 1997, winning the Division I 'Kentwell Cup'. =Recent times: 2010 to present= In 2011, Hunters Hill won the interdivisional Cowboy Cup, as well as the Division II Club Champions Reliance Shield and first grade John Barraclough Cup, to gain promotion once again to Division I in 2012. In 2016, Hunters Hill won the Subbies 7's Tournament, beating Blacktown 15–5 in the final,http://www.rugby.net.au/news/Hunters-Hill- Win-Magners-Subbies-7s-x-15846.html before claiming the Barraclough Cup once again as the first grade premiers in Division II. 2017 saw all four senior grades participate in the finals, with 1st grade and 3rd grade claiming the minor premierships. Hunter's Hill was awarded the Division II Club Champions Reliance Shield. This success has provided Hunters Hill promotion to Tier I for the 2018 season.http://rugbyresults.rugby.net.au/ladder.asp?id=274172&seasonid;=431  NSW Suburban Rugby Union Premierships  Hunters Hill has won club championship and premiership titles across multiple competitions since 1919: =Club Championships= Interdivisional *2011 - Interdivisional Club Champions: Cowboy Cup Division I *1987 - Club Champions: Bruce Graham Shield, *1981 - Club Champions: Bruce Graham Shield *1980 - Club Champions: Bruce Graham Shield *1979 - Club Champions: Bruce Graham Shield Division II *2020 - Club Champions: Reliance Shield *2017 - Club Champions: Reliance Shield *2011 - Club Champions: Reliance Shield *1994 - Club Champions: Reliance Shield *1993 - Club Champions: Reliance Shield Division III *2009 - Club Champions: Doc Harris Shield =Premierships= Division I *2000 - Colts Barbour Cup (Joint Premiers: Old Ignatians) *1997 - 1st Grade Kentwell Cup *1995 - 1st Grade Kentwell Cup *1987 - 1st Grade Kentwell Cup, 2nd Grade Burke Cup *1986 - 3rd Grade Whiddon Cup *1985 - 4th Grade Judd Cup *1983 - 3rd Grade Whiddon Cup, 4th Grade Judd Cup *1982 - 3rd Grade Whiddon Cup *1981 - 1st Grade Kentwell Cup *1980 - 2nd Grade Burke Cup, 3rd Grade Whiddon Cup, 4th Grade Judd Cup *1979 - 1st Grade Kentwell Cup, 4th Grade Judd Cup *1978 - 1st Grade Kentwell Cup, 3rd Grade Whiddon Cup *1977 - 1st Grade Kentwell Cup*, 2nd Grade Burke Cup, 3rd Grade Whiddon Cup *1972 - 1st Grade Kentwell Cup *1969 - 3rd Grade Whiddon Cup *1955 - 3rd Grade Whiddon Cup *1954 - 2nd Grade Burke Cup *1951 - 3rd Grade Whiddon Cup *1949 - 3rd Grade Whiddon Cup Division II *2020 - 1st Grade Barraclough Cup, 1st Grade Minor Premiers, 2nd Grade Stockdale Cup, *2019 - 2nd Grade Stockdale Cup, 4th Grade Richardson Cup *2017 - 1st Grade Minor Premiers, 3rd Grade - Blunt Cup; *2016 - 1st Grade Barraclough Cup *2011 - 1st Grade Barraclough Cup *2010 - 2nd Grade Stockdale Cup, 4th Grade Richardson Cup *1994 - 3rd Grade Blunt Cup *1992 - 2nd Grade Stockdale Cup Division III *2005 - 4th Grade Nicholson Cup, Colts Rugby Club Cup *2008 - 4th Grade Nicholson Cup NSWRU: Reserve Grade B division *1926 - 2nd Grade Burke Cup* *1925 - 2nd Grade Burke Cup (Joint Premiers: Briars) *1919 - 1st Grade Premiers =Subbies Preseason 7s= *2019 - Cup Winner *2017 - Cup Winner Notes: * indicates undefeated season.

The site was discontinued abruptly on 26 March 2019, with Sinclair stating that industry changes did not justify the continuation of Circa News as a website (and three days before sister property KidsClick was also closed with little notice). The former domain for the site now redirects to Sinclair's streaming portal, Stirr. History =Early years= Circa's original logo (c. 2012-2015)On 16 October 2012, Circa launched its application for iOS. The app featured news and information from different sources and viewpoints that were stitched together into a story designed to be shifted around and changed easily as stories developed. The founders' aim for Circa was \\"to pursue a more pure definition of news with truths divorced from conjecture, opinion or biased analysis\\". On 24 September 2014, Circa announced version 3.0 of its mobile applications. The update added a daily briefing service called \\"Wire\\", which aggregates top stories over a 24-hour period. \\\\- Circa would expand from the app world to the internet in February 2015 with the announcement of a web version, CircaNews.com. On 30 April 2015, Circa announced that it was looking for a buyer after failing to obtain a new funding round of venture capital financing. On 21 June 2015, Circa halted its news reporting operations for financial reasons. Three days later, on June 24, Circa announced that it would shut down and go on an \\"indefinite hiatus\\" following its inability to secure an buyer. CEO and co-founder Matt Galligan bade farewell to Circa in a blog post titled \\"Farewell to Circa News\\" in which, he admired the successes of Circa, but lamented the company's failure to become a sustainable business. =Acquisition and relaunch= On November 22, 2015, a few former Circa employees reported that the CircaNews.com website was again active, stating a simple message that \\"Circa will be back soon...\\". A report by the Nieman Journalism Lab said that the site's domain name was registered a month earlier to Sinclair Broadcast Group.\\"Is Circa back? The mobile app might be returning via local TV stations\\", Nieman Lab, 23 November 2015 Sinclair confirmed on 7 December 2015, that it had acquired Circa News, its intellectual property and assets earlier in 2015, and aimed to relaunch Circa in spring 2016. The acquisition of Circa was to be funded by a Sinclair subsidiary (Sinclair Digital Ventures) and potentially other investors. Circa CEO Matt Galligan mentioned at its closure the previous June that the company could sell or \\"white-label\\" its technology to a news-producing company for use in its own apps. The revived Circa formally went live on 18 July 2016 with a redesigned app and a website using a new URL, Circa.com.\\"CIRCA LAUNCHES EAGERLY-AWAITED ADVANCED WEBSITE...\\" press release from SBGI, 18 July 2016 From December 2016, Circa was led by the chief operating officer John Solomon, the former vice-president of content and business development for The Washington Times. Solomon was hired by Sinclair as Circa's chief creative officer in December 2015.\\"Sinclair Sets Circa Debut, Hires CCO\\", TVNewsCheck, 7 July 2015 \\\\- \\"SINCLAIR PROMOTES JOHN SOLOMON TO CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF CIRCA\\", press release from SBGI, 12 December 2016 Solomon left Circa to join The Hill in July 2017. The app announced in March 2017 that it would be shutting down.  Ideology  Sinclair says that it aims to \\"let the content drive [Circa]\\" and not let the site adhere to any set political or cultural viewpoint, describing Vice News and Breitbart as \\"partisan-driven\\" news sites that the new Circa would not intentionally emulate. Though Sinclair has aired conservative political content on its stations, its stated intention with Circa was to present information with \\"no spin, just facts and transparency\\" and in \\"an irreverent tone\\" that will allow the site's target audience (young adults 18 to 35 years old) to form its own opinions. Circa's reporting has been characterized by other media outlets as conservative. Circa attracted attention for its reporting on Russian interference in the 2016 election, which broke many stories seen to be favorable to the Trump administration. According to The Hill, Circa's reporting on Russian interference has \\"only a peripheral focus on whether anyone in Trump’s inner circle had contact with Russian officials during the campaign\\". It has been reported that Sinclair had made an agreement with the Trump campaign to be given greater access in exchange for favorable coverage. Solomon said that reporting in many mainstream outlets was \\"reckless, false, unfair and imbalanced\\". Features Since its original iteration, the Circa mobile app and website have offered \\"atomization\\" of news rather than \\"summarization\\". \\"Atomization\\", as originally expressed by Circa, means \\"to break down a story into its core elements: facts, stats, quotes and media\\", as opposed to a summary where content is reduced for quicker reading or users are linked elsewhere for the full story. Circa initially pushed multiple updates, also known as \\"points\\", over the days, weeks and months as stories continued to develop. The Circa app also allowed users to \\"follow\\" particular stories in order to receive future developments. As relaunched in 2016, the Circa app and the Circa.com website retained the original \\"atomization\\" approach to delivering the news. The redesigned Circa emphasized \\"short- and long-form video, optimized for mobile and social media engagement\\". Circa utilizes original reporting from its own 80-person staff, user-generated content and access to video feeds and reportage from Sinclair's 172 owned-or-operated TV stations.\\"Sinclair Acquired and Will Relaunch Mobile News Site Circa\\", The Wall Street Journal, 12 July 2015\\"It's official: Something called Circa will launch next year...\\", Nieman Lab, 12 July 2015 \\"Sinclair Making Circa Live Again With Video\\", Broadcasting & Cable, 14 June 2016 Circa features several portals and micro-sites accessible through its website, app and social media platforms.

History  The Sikin Panjang is the most popular fighting weapon of the inhabitants of northern Sumatra. In the early years of the Aceh War against the Dutch (which began in 1873 and lasted for over thirty years) many Sikins were made, especially prior to 1879 when a start was made with disarmament of the population. It is a version of Klewang. The spread of the Sikin Panjang was limited to Sumatra, and especially to Aceh and Gayo (where the term Luju Naru is used), but also in Alas (where it is named Andar) and to a lesser degree in the Batak area. Another typical sword in this region is the Balato of the Nias people. During the Aceh Sultanate period, the Panglima Prang (warlord) ranking titles were given. The Sikin Panjang and Rencong which the Panglima Prang receives from the Ulubalang (district chief) on his appointment, he must return to the Ulubalang again if he should ever embrace the cause of an enemy of the Ulubalang. Person of position or those who are going on a journey carry in addition the Sikin Panjang which is the common weapon used in fighting. It is of uniform width from end to end, and placed in a sheath.  Description  The Sikin Panjang is a straight, single edged sword. The sword comes with its sheath, and carried at the waist. Parts of the Sikin Panjang includes the wilah (blade), hulu (handle), sarung (sheath). The back and the edge of the blade are parallel making it a very straight sword. The blade also has a hollow ground edge throughout the blade. The hilt is shaped like the letter Y, with its length up to 25 cm. The moderate overall length of the sword is approximately 70 to 79 cm. The blade of the sword is usually made of pamor (pattern welding or Damascus) steel.

Doris or Dresden Doris, later known as the Akaflieg Dresden D-B2 Doris, was a monoplane glider built in Germany in 1922. It was unusual in having wings which could independently adjust their angles of attack, a feature intended to increase the energy acquired from gusts of wind. Design and development After the collaboration between the Technical High School Dresden (TH Dresden) and the local flying club, the Flugtechnischer Verein Dresden (F.V.D.), that led to the quite successful 1921 F.V.D. Stehaufchen wing warping biplane glider, the group designed and built a monoplane, the Doris. Originally known as the Dresden Doris or, in the UK at least, as the F.V.D. monoplane, it was later incorporated retrospectively into the Akaflieg Dresden's design list as the D-B2 Doris. Most notably, it had wings which could adjust their relative angles of attack independently both of each other and of the pilot. The idea of such wings came from the poor understanding of slope soaring in the early 1920s and from observations of bird flight, where wings were seen to twist independently. It was hoped that such freedom could better capture the energy of the gusts that were thought to be the source of slope lift. An early glider of this type had been built by Erich Offermann before World War I and some theoretical work done by Albert Betz and, independently, R. Knoller, began to reach an understanding of how a plunging airfoil could generate thrust (the Knoller-Betz effect). By about 1920 Friedrich Harth was convinced this was essential for extended glider flight and the Harth-Messerschmitt designs were controlled in pitch by a variable angle of incidence wing and roll by wing warping. Its pilot had two levers, one for roll and the other for pitch. The 1921 Loessl Sb.1 Münchener, which won two first and one second prizes at the second Rhön (Wasserkuppe) gliding contest, extended the idea with wings that could be independently rotated with a single, conventional control column, doing away with the wing warping. Ten of the fifty-three competing aircraft at the third Rhön contest, held in 1922, had variable incidence wings but as slope soaring was better understood and the high control forces needed appreciated, rigid wings with ailerons for roll control became standard on gliders. The Doris was a high-wing monoplane using a thick, highly cambered Göttingen 441 airfoil, braced from the lower fuselage on each side by a wide spread inverted V pair of struts connected to the wing at about 30% of the span, immediately below the single main wing spar on which the wing rotated. This was at about 40% chord, where the wing was thickest. The spars were mounted over the fuselage on a narrow central faired column. The wing was largely fabric covered but from the spar forward it was plywood skinned around the leading edge on the upper side, though the ply did not extend as far aft on the underside. The extreme tips were also ply covered. The fuselage of the Doris had a wooden frame girder structure with a rectangular cross section, tapering aft to a horizontal wedge. Forward of the wing trailing edge it was ply covered, with fabric covering elsewhere. At the nose the sides curved round smoothly and there was also rounded decking immediately ahead of the open cockpit, which was under the leading edge with the vertical front face of the wing support column against the pilot's back. The rear edge of the column dropped gradually away from the trailing edge to the upper fuselage. The angles of incidence were adjusted from the control column via pushrods, sideways movement rotating the wings in opposite directions to roll. Fore and aft movement decreased and increased the angles of incidence together. The intention was that in level flight the pilot should largely allow the wings to follow their optimum setting by themselves. In addition there was a tailplane trim lever, originally fixed to the control column. The high aspect ratio, all-moving tailplane was nearly rectangular in plan apart from angled tips and was fabric covered behind its leading edge. The Doris was a short aircraft and its vertical tail was therefore large, with a quadrant shaped fin and a near rectangular rudder which had a small cut-away at its base for tailplane movement. The vertical tail surfaces were fabric covered. Like the Stehaufchen, the Doris had a pair of horizontal landing skids. These were fixed to the fuselage at the nose and mounted on the ends of a pair of transverse, arched ash brackets on rubber shock absorbers. Operational history The Doris took part in the 1922 Rhön contest, though Flight noted that it \\"does not appear to have accomplished very much\\". It remained on the Wasserkuppe after the competition but crashed, injuring Muttray. The accident, which badly damaged the Doris, was partially ascribed to the unfamiliar control column mounted tailplane trim lever, so when the glider was rebuilt this control was relocated further back in the cockpit. After the rebuild, completed in November 1922, the Doris flew from the Dresden club's airfield at Geising in the Erzgebirge. Some decent but unexceptional flights were made.

(2011). Anxiety buffer disruption theory: A terror management account of posttraumatic stress disorder. Anxiety, Stress, & Coping, 24(1), 3–26. Terror management theory posits that humans, unlike any other organism, are uniquely aware that death is the inevitable outcome of life. When thoughts of death are made salient, such as when a terrorist attack carries those thoughts into the level of consciousness, humans are subject to debilitating anxiety unless it can be \\"buffered.\\" Humans respond to the anxiety and dread mortality salience produces by clinging to their cultural worldview, through self-esteem and also close personal relationships.Miller, C. & Landau, M. (2005) Communication and terrorism: a terror management theory perspective. Communication Research Reports. Vol. 22 Nos 1–4 pages 79–88. Cultural worldviews, with their cultural norms, religious beliefs and moral values infuse life with meaning. They give life a feeling of normalcy and also a feeling of control. There is no way to definitely prove one's cultural worldview, there they are fragile human constructs and must be maintained. Clinging to a cultural worldview and self- esteem buffer the anxiety connected to thoughts of mortality.Luo, S., Shi, Z., Yang, X., Wang., X. & Han, S. (2014) Reminders of mortality decrease midcingulate activity in response to others' suffering. SCAN (9) 477–486. When thoughts of death are salient, humans are drawn to their cultural world view which \\"stipulates appropriate social requirements, and standards for valued conduct, while instilling one's life with meaning, order and permanence.\\" When a traumatic experience cannot be assimilated into a currently held cultural worldview, the anxiety-buffering mechanisms are disrupted.Edmondson, D., Chaudoir, S. R., Mills, M. A., Park, C. L., Holub, J., & Bartkowiak, J. M. (2011). From shattered assumptions to weakened worldviews: Trauma symptoms signal anxiety buffer disruption. Journal of Loss and Trauma, 16(4), 358–385. ABDT argues that individuals face overwhelming anxiety which leads to the symptoms of PTSD including re-experiencing, hyper-arousal, avoidance and disassociation.Pyszczynski, T., & Kesebir, P. Anxiety buffer disruption theory: a terror management account of posttraumatic stress disorder. Anxiety, Stress, & Coping. Vol 24. No. 1, Jan. 2011, 3–26.Abdollahi, A., Maxfield, M., Pyszczynski, T, & Luxzezynski, A. Posttraumatic stress reactions as a disruption in anxiety-buffer functioning: dissociation and responses to mortality salience as predictors of severity of posttraumatic symptoms. Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice and Policy. 2011, Vol. 3, Nov. 4, 329–341. The dissociation causes atypical responses to mortality salience compared with individuals who do not suffer from an anxiety buffer disruption. When the anxiety buffer disruption is mild, exaggerated coping responses, such as rejecting or taking offense at other cultures, is expected. When the anxiety buffer disruption is severe, there can be a total breakdown of coping mechanisms.Abdollahi, A., Pyszczynski, T., Maxfield, M., & Luszczynska, A. (2011). Posttraumatic stress reactions as a disruption in anxiety-buffer functioning: Dissociation and responses to mortality salience as predictors of severity of posttraumatic symptoms. Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy, 3(4), 329. The theory was proposed by Tom Pyszczynski and Pelin Kesebir.  Origins  = Shattered assumption theory = In 1992, Janoff-Bulman delineated a theory of trauma response (Shattered Assumptions Theory). Janoff-Bulman posits that humans have basic assumptions about the world in which they live, based on the belief that the world is a benevolent and meaningful place and that the individual has self- worth.Mills, M. (2010) Shattered assumptions? A prospective study: The impact of trauma of global beliefs and adjustment. Doctoral Dissertations. Paper AAI3447452. http://digitalcommons.uconn.edu/dissertations/AAI3447452. These assumptions give the individual the illusion that they have a measure of control on their own lives as well as a feeling of invulnerability. When an individual faces a traumatic event, their deeply held beliefs that the world is a benevolent and meaningful place and that they have a worthy role in that world are shattered. The world is no longer benevolent or predictable. Terror management theory and anxiety buffer disruption theory have taken the concept one step further. = Anxiety buffer disruption theory = Anxiety buffer disruption theory not only focuses on the thoughts and emotions of an individual, but it also studies the behavior that results when terror management theory and shattered assumptions theory are examined together. Excessive anxiety experienced by post-traumatic stress disorder sufferers occurs because the events causing the post-traumatic stress disorder have demonstrated to these individuals that anxiety-buffering mechanisms are not capable of protecting them from death. Individuals who have high levels of peritraumatic dissociation and low levels of self-efficacy coping, two indicators of post-traumatic stress disorder, have abnormal responses to reminders of death. These individuals in turn do not utilize the coping mechanisms that are typically used to remove the fear of death: culture, self- esteem, and interpersonal relationships. In fact, in individuals with post traumatic stress disorder, mortality salience coping mechanisms are viewed as worthless and perhaps are even seen to be detestable. = Components of anxiety buffers = * Cultural Worldview: Individuals who have post traumatic stress disorder will often reject their culture when provided with mortality salience triggers, the direct opposite of what terror management theory demonstrates to be true in those without post traumatic stress disorder. Cultural worldviews infuse life with structure, purpose and meaning. People maintain these fragile constructions by preferring the company of the like- minded. But when faced with a traumatic event, there are times when the horror cannot be assimilated into the framework of the person's existing cultural worldview. * Self-Esteem: Various studies demonstrate that individuals who have post traumatic stress disorder also have decreased self-esteem. Self- esteem cannot function well as an anxiety buffering system in those who have post traumatic stress disorder as the buffer is weakened in these individuals. High self-esteem can displace defensive responses and buffer against the terror of mortality salience because it is a signal that the individual is living at the standard they should, based on their world view. Self-worth as the terror management theory suggests is an essential component of the existential anxiety- buffering system. PTSD is related to a breakdown in this system, and noted that veterans with past and present, or ongoing PTSD have shown to have lower self-esteem. According to ABDT this leaves this group particularly vulnerable to anxiety, since self-worth is an integral part of the individual’s anxiety- buffering mechanism. [1] * Close Relationships: It is often mentioned that worldview and self-esteem affect ways in which our fears of death are buffered with ABDT. Close relationships also serve as a regulator of these fears. Previous studies hinted at that close relationships played a role in terror management, but they did not conceptualize, theoretically explain, or test the context of close relationships in Terror Management Theories.Florian, V., Mikulincer, M., & Hirschberger, G. (2002). The anxiety-buffering function of close relationships: evidence that relationship commitment acts as a terror management mechanism. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 82(4), 527. Close relationships seem to be a product of natural selection because of their reproductive and survival benefits, having reproductive benefits contribute to the survival of people’s genes through their offspring. Therefore, close relationships increase the likelihood of mating and brings about other survival skills like gathering food, finding shelter, environmental awareness, and protects offspring from dangers.Buss, D. M., & Schmitt, D. P. (1993). Sexual strategies theory: an evolutionary perspective on human mating. Psychological review, 100(2), 204. Love and belongingness are ranked over those of esteem and self- actualization.Maslow, A. H., Frager, R., & Cox, R. (1970). Motivation and personality (Vol. 2). J. Fadiman, & C. McReynolds (Eds.). New York: Harper & Row. The formation and maintenance of close relationships have been recognized in both infants and adults as a source of regulating distress. It is also noted that self- esteem can also stem from close relationships. Based on these things it was assumed that formation and maintenance of close relationships may serve as a death- anxiety- buffering mechanism. Close relationships appear to have inoculating power against basic existential threats, which allows people to respond to these threats by fulfilling relational potentials. Second, it seems the sense of relationship commitment is shaped by not only perceived relational investment, gains, and potential alternatives, as well as the existential need of denial of death awareness. Third, it seems processes of terror management not only include worldview defenses to protect the self, but also promote commitment to significant others and the expansion of the self, provided by these relationships. An important finding is that close relationships may serve as a fundamental anxiety buffer. It appears close relationships not only protect individuals from concrete and actual threats or danger, but also offer a symbolic shield against the awareness of one’s finitude. Since the threat of death is inescapable, the support from those close to us make may make the thought of death more tolerable by giving meaning to our lives by being important to others. As other anxiety buffers, interpersonal relationships are damaged as well in individuals with post traumatic stress disorder. People with post traumatic stress disorder have higher rates of divorce, more difficulty with their children, are more prone to domestic violence, and are emotionally distant from loved ones. All of these are damaging and as a result, terror management cannot be accomplished through close interpersonal relationships.  Anxiety buffer disruption theory studies  = Posttraumatic stress reactions = A study looked at dissociation responses and PTSD in students who survived the 2005 Zarand earthquake in Iran. The earthquake measured 6.4 on the Richter scale, killed more than 1,500 people and displaced more than 6,700 for two months or more. It looked at dissociation one month later then two years later to see if level of dissociation predicted PTSD. Four weeks after the earthquake, researchers solicited for volunteers at local universities. All of the participants met the DSM-IV criterion for a Class A1 trauma. Many were wearing black mourning clothes or had injuries from the earthquake. Three priming conditions were employed: mortality salience, earthquake or dental pain. The researchers then evaluated how the subjects felt toward foreign aid in the wake of the disaster. The results indicated that subjects with high dissociative tendencies showed no effect of mortality salience on attitudes toward the foreign aid. Subjects with low dissociative tendencies reacted as terror management theory predicts when confronted with mortality salience and thought of the earthquake. Two years after the quake, the researchers returned and 172 of the original respondents participated. They predicted that subjects with high PTSD symptoms would have a disrupted worldview on both foreign aid and the Islamic dress code. They found a strong relationship between dissociation and subsequent PTSD symptom severity. Even after the passage of two years, subjects with high dissociative tendencies were still not defending against existential threats in a way typical for the population who has not experienced trauma. = Extent of trauma exposure and PTSD symptom severity = 105 students of the University of Abidjan took the Post-Traumatic Stress Checklist-Civilian Version and then an opinion survey on the civil war in Cote d'Ivoire. Last, they took part in a word-completion task designed to measure their accessibility of death-related thoughts. This study, unlike previous studies related to terror management theory, looked at the subjects' thoughts of death as related to the war, a specific traumatic event. In the control condition, where subjects were asked to talk about their anxiety related to their worst exam, death thought accessibility was lower for those with higher levels of PTSD. This suggests that people suffering from strong PTSD repress thoughts of death. But when mortality was made salient, it provoked a marked increase in death thought accessibility for those with high PTSD. The results indicate that the anxiety buffer of death thought suppression under normal circumstances failed when subjects were reminded of the traumatic event. A second experiment was conducted with 197 students of the University of Ajidjan where they evaluated exposure (proximity) to a traumatic event. In this case, it was geographical location to the civil war. The researchers hypothesized that subjects who lived where the fighting was more constant and intense would be more likely to increase their PTSD reports when mortality was made salient. Those who lived in an area of less conflict should not increase their reports of PTSD. As a form of defensive denial, the researchers predicted they might report lower levels of symptoms. As expected, subjects who had more exposure to war reported greater PTSD symptoms in the mortality salience condition.Chatard, A., Pyszczynski, T., Arndt, J., Selimbegović, L., Konan, P. N., & Van der Linden, M. (2012). Extent of trauma exposure and PTSD symptom severity as predictors of anxiety-buffer functioning.

In 1077/8, Abd al-Hamid was appointed by Sultan Ibrahim as his vizier, and after the latter's death in 1099, continued to serve as vizier under his son Mas'ud III until 1114/5.

However, Arslan-Shah's reign turned out short; his mother, a Seljuq princess named Gawhar Khatun was treated badly, which resulted in her brother Ahmad Sanjar to invade Arslan-Shah's domains, where he managed to decisively defeat Arslan- Shah and make the latter's brother Bahram-Shah the new ruler of the Ghaznavid dynasty, while at the same time acknowledging Sejluq suzerainty.

Situated on the Green River, a major tributary of the Colorado River, the dam was proposed for the Echo Park district of Dinosaur National Monument, flooding much of the Green and Yampa river valleys in the monument. The dam was bitterly opposed by preservationists, who saw the encroachment of a dam into an existing national park as another Hetch Hetchy, to be opposed as an appropriation of protected lands for development purposes. A compromise led to the abandonment of the Echo Park project in favor of Glen Canyon Dam on the main stem of the Colorado in lands that were not at that time protected. Project history The project was first proposed in 1941. Dinosaur National Monument was, at the time of its designation in 1915, a small park unit focused on the dinosaur fossil beds discovered along the Green River in 1909. The monument was expanded in 1938 to , encompassing the canyon networks of the Green and Yampa upstream from the dinosaur quarry. The newly added areas were little known to the public and to the Park Service, and the Park Service initially did not oppose the dam plans, having allied itself with the Bureau of Reclamation to develop Boulder Dam National Recreation Area (later Lake Mead National Recreation Area and other reservoirs as public recreation facilities. The Park Service finally came out against the proposal in 1950, with director Newton B. Drury in opposition to the position of Secretary of the Interior Oscar L. Chapman, whose department controlled both the Park Service and the Bureau of Reclamation. Drury stated in the 1950 Park Service annual report that reservoir projects would \\"destroy or impair the beauty and interest\\" of the national parks. Drury, a Republican in a Democratic administration, resigned in 1951, leading to criticism of Chapman for forcing Drury out. Drury was followed for eight months by Arthur Demaray, then by Conrad Wirth. Wirth took a less confrontational approach, partly under orders from Chapman to make the disagreement less public. Wirth was an advocate of public recreation lands associated with Reclamation projects, and suggested that Echo Park could become a National Recreation Area once flooded with a reservoir. Steamboat Rock, near the Echo Park damsite The first widely published public reaction to the Echo Park Dam proposal was a July 22, 1950 article by Bernard DeVoto in The Saturday Evening Post, entitled \\"Shall We Let Them Ruin Our National Parks?\\" Implicitly comparing the flooding of Echo Park to the Hetch Hetchy intrusion in Yosemite, the article was picked up by Readers Digest and saw wide circulation. The Colorado River Storage Project was proposed by the Bureau of Reclamation in the early 1950s as an integrated plan for collecting and using the waters of the upper Colorado River. Politically, the project had the backing of the upper Colorado states: Colorado, Wyoming and Utah, as well as Arizona, who had all fought with California over water allocations from the Colorado, of which California consumed a disproportionate share. Construction of storage reservoirs high on the river system would allow the upstream states more control over the water and its use. In 1955, new Secretary of the Interior Douglas McKay withdrew the Interior Department's support for the Echo Park Dam. =Glen Canyon Dam= Glen Canyon Dam was proposed from the beginning of the Colorado River Storage Project as the project's chief feature. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes had proposed the establishment of Escalante National Monument in 1936, at twice the size of Yellowstone National Park, that would have encompassed Glen Canyon and the surrounding lands. The proposal was whittled down by excluding grazing lands, and then by intervention by Utah, favoring the reservation of Glen Canyon as a reservoir site. In the 1940s and 1950s this proposal was apparently forgotten or ignored. The Glen Canyon region was a virtually unknown wilderness, not widely regarded as particularly high in scenic value. A 1946 survey of potential recreational resources undertaken by the National Park Service in the Colorado Basin entirely omits the Glen Canyon region from its assessment, focusing instead on the Aquarius Plateau to the northwest and Monument Valley to the southeast. The Park Service had no official opinion on Glen Canyon, since it was not a Park Service unit and was tacitly excluded from Park Service plans, while the Sierra Club, focused on the fight to keep water development out of established parks, failed to realize until it was too late that Glen Canyon possessed scenic and wilderness value even greater than Dinosaur. Sierra Club executive director David Brower's assent to a suggestion that the proposed Glen Canyon Dam be raised led Brower's critics to suggest that he effectively sacrificed Glen Canyon to save Dinosaur. Brower considered the trade his biggest mistake. Project details The Echo Park project actually involved two dams: the main Echo Park Dam with a reservoir pool elevation of above sea level, and a smaller afterbay dam downstream at Split Mountain, that would collect and re-regulate discharges from the main dam, assuring an even river flow. The Split Mountain pool was planned for an elevation of . Echo Park Dam was planned for a site just downstream from Steamboat Rock, a monolith standing just below the confluence of the Green and Yampa, where the Green flows out of Echo Park, a broad wooded flatland walled by steep canyon cliffs. Located at the base of Harpers Point, the dam was to be a high concrete gravity dam. Above Echo Park the reservoir was to flood the Canyon of Lodore, extending upstream through Browns Park. The Yampa was to be flooded as well to Lily Park. Roughly half of Steamboat Rock's height would have been underwater, along with archeological sites, caves and wilderness valleys. A Park Service report on the dam's effects on the monument called it a \\"lamentable intrusion\\" with \\"particularly deplorable effects\\" on wilderness and geological features in the monument. Electric power transmission lines would intrude into the park as well. Installed power generating capacity was to amount to 200 MW. Whirlpool Canyon, which would have been flooded by Split Mountain Dam Split Mountain Dam, high, was to be sited a couple of miles downstream from Split Mountain, about two miles in a straight line from the Quarry Visitor Center, or about ten river miles upstream. The pool was to back up through Whirlpool Canyon to the toe of Echo Park Dam. The two dams were to create slackwater reservoirs throughout virtually the entire monument on the Green and Yampa. Although Split Mountain Dam was to have a hydraulic height of about , a penstock was planned to be built to carry water across a deep bend of the Green, taking advantage of the river's fall to create a head for power generation. The Split Mountain reservoir would have inundated Rainbow, Island and Little Rainbow Parks.

The four-story brick building was built in stages between 1885 and 1900, and was a prototypical structure from which the design of other period shoe factories in Manchester were built. Construction was overseen by Head & Dowst, a builder responsible for a number of area public buildings, including schools and prisons. It was funded by local businessmen seeking to diversify the local economy, and was leased to the Kimball Brothers, a leading shoe manufacturer in Lynn, Massachusetts. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The Kimball Brothers Shoe Factory is located about east of downtown Manchester, in a predominantly residential area. It occupies a parcel bounded on three sides by Cypress and Massabesic streets and Woodman Avenue. It is a U-shaped four-story brick building with typical late 19th- century industrial styling. Windows are set in segmented-arch openings, and the building is crowned by a modest corbelled cornice. The building exhibits a unified style despite three different major building phases. Its interior has been converted to residential use. The oldest portion, the Cypress Street elevation, was built in 1885, at a time when shoemaking was a cottage industry in the city, and textile mills were its major business. A consortium of local businessmen organized the Manchester Shoe Manufacturing Company in that year in a bid to diversify the city's economic base. The building was immediately leased to Kimball Manufacturing of Lynn, and was enlarged in 1890 and 1900. The Kimballs had been in business since 1878, and moved the bulk of their production to Manchester after a fire destroyed their Lynn plant in 1889. They operated on the premises until 1929, and it remained in use for shoe manufacturing until 1970. The building served as a prototype for the construction of other shoe factories in the area, including the Hoyt Shoe Factory.

It was made an independent parish in 1614 under the advocation of the Immaculate Conception. The paintings were restored by Rex Papasin, a Batangueño artist. The Church is temporarily closed to the public after it was affected by the 2017 Batangas earthquakes. History =Earlier Churches= Fr. Diego de Mojica was said to have constructed the first temporary church made of light materials in 1578. The Church was put under the title of the Immaculate Conception. The church was burned down by the fire that gutted the whole town in 1615. In 1686, Fr. Jose Rodriguez began laying the new foundation of a new church made of stone. The main nave was finished in the same year with the help of Fr. Manuel del Buensuceso and the townspeople. Fr. Jose de San Bartolome completed the transept made of reef stone on 1706 and it was blessed in 1721. The church was gutted by fire again after a lightning bolt in 1747 and was repaired in 1756 during the time of Don Ramon Orendain. =Present Church= The former Father Provincial, Fr. Pedro Cuesta, demolished the old church which he found too small for the increasing population of the town and started the construction of the new one on the same site in 1851. He also built the strong fence of the atrium to enclose the church and convent. The church was damaged by earthquake in 1863 and repaired and reinforced with walls and buttresses. After the roof fell in 1880, it was repaired in 1884 by Fr. Bruno Laredo. The convent built in 1693, of reef stone and huge molave post withstood all the earthquakes until Fr. Melchor Fernández constructed a new one in 1792. It was later used as a school building by the Saint Bridget College. Later on the second floor of the convent was demolished and was converted into a parish pastoral hall. The church has undergone several restorations. The second and third stories of the belfry was completed in 1934. In 1936, old windows were changed and 23 chandeliers were added. The facade collapsed during the April 8, 1942 earthquake and was repaired between 1945 and 1946. In 1954, the exterior was painted with general repairs in 1957. The exterior was beautified and the frescoes were retouched on the occasion of the centennial celebration. On February 13, 1945, the church was declared a Minor Basilica of the Immaculate Conception. The Declaration was made upon the request of Lipa's Bishop Alfredo Verzosa.

It is topped by a bronze quadriga sculptural group with a woman charioteer, representing Brabant raising the national flag. The columns echo the original layout of Avenue de Tervuren, which was once divided into three roadways lined with a double row of trees. The sidewalls feature personifications of Belgian provinces: Brabant being represented by the quadriga, East Flanders, West Flanders, Antwerp, Liège, Hainaut, Limburg, Namur and Luxembourg. Twelve spandrels are decorated with allegories of Arts and Industry. History The arch was a part of a project planned by Leopold II of Belgium, who wanted to beautify Brussels. The idea of the arch was originally conceived by Gédéon Bordiau, but upon his death in 1904 the arch's design was revised by Charles Girault. Girault designed a triple arcade, but preserved Bordiau's idea of the quadriga. The foundation of the arch was laid down on 4 January 1905.Funding for the arch came from rubber exports from the Congo Free State (source: Reader's Africa The basic construction was completed in May of the same year and the arch was inaugurated by Leopold II on 27 September 1905. In 1912 the colonnade's interior was decorated with the mosaic by Jean Delville. He was then joined by several other artists. The mosaic decoration was completed in 1932. Quadriga The arch's bronze quadriga was made by Thomas Vinçotte and horses by Jules Lagae.

The oldest portion of this 1-1/2 story Cape style house was built c. 1741, and is one of the oldest surviving houses in the area. It was owned by the same family for over 200 years, and its interior includes stencilwork that may have been made by Moses Eaton Jr., an itinerant artist of the 19th century. The property also includes a barn, located on the other side of Tinker Road, which is of great antiquity. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The McClure-Hilton House is located in a rural-suburban setting in southern Merrimack, on bisected by Tinker Road south of Camp Sargent Road. The property includes the main house, located on the east side of the road, and a barn, set on the west side of the road. The house is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. A gabled ell extends to the right. The main facade is five bays wide, with slightly asymmetrical placement of paired sash windows on either side of a nearly- centered entrance. The entrance is topped by a four-light transom window, and sheltered by a portico with a low-pitch gable roof. The interior follows a central chimney plan, with a narrow entrance vestibule, parlor and hall chambers on either side of the chimney, and a long kitchen in the back, with small chambers in the rear corners. The front rooms have original plaster above broad horizontal wainscoting; the hall on the left is notable for the stencilwork applied to the plaster. The parlor is plainer, but retains an original builtin cabinet. The exact construction date of the house is unknown. According to family lore, it was built in 1722, but this is at odds with town history, which places all settlement after the town's early proprietors made a land division in 1733, and William McClure's first land purchase in 1741. Stylistic evidence suggests the house was built about 1740. The house remained in the hands of McClure's descendants until 1942. The stencilwork in the hall is believed to have been executed by either Moses Eaton Sr. or Moses Eaton Jr., regionally prominent artists active from the late 18th to late 19th centuries.

Turning professional the following December, Oxley made his Football League debut at the end of the 1925–26 season he spent two seasons as a first-team player before attracting the attention of Sheffield United. The Blades signed Oxley in May 1928 for £1,350 and initially employed him on the right wing but later selected him in a number of attacking positions. He initially formed a strong partnership with Jack Pickering at the start of the 1929–30 season but an operation for appendicitis saw Oxley miss a large number of games. Eventually returning to the first team Oxley's form was inconsistent and he eventually lost his place in 1932. Oxley remained at United for two more seasons, mainly playing in the reserves, and was eventually sold to cross-town rivals Sheffield Wednesday for £1,000 in May 1934. Unable to find a regular starting place with his new club Oxley moved again to Plymouth Argyle for £600 in September 1935 and again to Stockport County in June 1936. Oxley's career was revived at County and he featured regularly, helping the side win the Third Division (North) title in 1936–37 season. Dropping into non-league in 1938, Oxley spent a brief time as player-manager with Worksop Town before signing as player-coach with Scunthorpe and Lindley United in November 1938. In 1939 Oxley moved to The Netherlands to coach football and cricket and was appointed coach at HVV Den Haag but was forced to flee in 1940 following the German invasion.

Sauropod neck posture is a subject occasionally debated among scientists, with some favoring postures closer to horizontal whilst others a more upright posture. Research has looked at various avenues of evidence and analysis including: attempting to reconstruct the neutral posture of their necks and estimating range of motion by studying the bones; attempting to reconstruct sauropod metabolism and the energy requirements of sustaining incredibly long necks in various postures; and comparing sauropod neck anatomy to those of living animals.  Biomechanics  The biomechanics of sauropod skeletons and necks can help determine at what angle the neck was positioned. = Flexibility = In 2013, a study led by Matthew J. Cobley and published in PLOS ONE focused on the flexibility of the necks of sauropods. They compared the necks of ostriches with sauropod genera to find out how flexible the necks really were. The study noted that previous biomechanics studies found the necks to have been positioned between the extremes of a vertical, and a downward slanted neck. In conclusion, the study found that sauropod neck flexibility should not be based on osteology alone, and if it is, the results should be used with caution. Even though there is a lack of preserved muscle tissue that would determine flexibility, sauropod necks were probably less flexible than previously thought. In 2014, Mike P. Taylor analysed the flexibility in the necks of Apatosaurus and Diplodocus. He found that Cobley et al. was incorrect in the fact that vertebrae imply the neck is less flexible than in actuality. Cobley et al. found necks to be much less flexible than in reality when cartilage was added. It was found that the cartilage between the joints would have allowed for the neck to flex far past 90°. However, Taylor noted that while the neck could flex above the vertical, the osteological neutral pose would have been around horizontal, with the habitual pose having the head held upwards in an alert pose. = Muscling = Sauropod necks were probably highly muscled to suit their feeding level. Brachiosaurus brancai (now Giraffititan) was probably a high browser, so it would have been more muscled along the neck than other sauropods like Diplodocus and Dicraeosaurus who were low browsers. The tail and limb length of B. brancai would also need to be greater, to balance out the inclined neck. However, the question of whether sauropods were endothermic or ectothermic plays a major part in how sauropods were muscled, as endotherms have particularly more intestines and stomach than ectotherms. The amount of gut needed could determine how much food was eaten by sauropods, and therefore at what elevation their heads were held. = Heart and metabolic stress = The previous upright posture of sauropod necks would require great blood pressure and a strong heart. One 2000 study conducted by Roger Seymour and Harvey Lillywhite found that the blood pressure needed to reach the head with an upright neck would be . This could be fatal to an endotherm, and also highly dangerous to an ectotherm. If sauropods were endothermic metabolically, it would certainly be impossible for them to survive with upright necks, as the blood pressure would be too high to live even with thicker heart muscling. A later study by Seymour concluded that it would have required half the energy of any particular sauropod to pump the blood to the head. This would lower the probability of sauropods being high browsers, and instead having lower necks while feeding than commonly portrayed.  Hypotheses  Restored posture of Opisthocoelicaudia from the original description (A), and by Schwartz et al. (B) A few hypotheses have been generated to solve the dispute over how sauropods held their necks. = Horizontal pose = Kent Stevens and Michael Parrish are the two main supporters of a horizontal neck posture. In 1999, they studied the genera Apatosaurus and Diplodocus, finding the habitual pose of the genera to be slightly declined. They claimed that both sauropods had necks much less flexible than previously thought, with the neck vertebrae of Diplodocus being more inflexible than Apatosaurus. Those two poses would suggest that the sauropods were ground feeders, instead of browsing off taller flora. Later, in 2005, Stevens and Parrish again studied the biomechanics of sauropod necks, but this time on a wider variety of sauropods, those inhabiting the Jurassic. Specifically, Apatosaurus, Diplodocus, Camarasaurus, Brachiosaurus, Dicraeosaurus, Cetiosaurus, and Euhelopus were studied, and each and every one was stated to have a horizontally held neck by Stevens and Parrish. The pair even went as far a saying that all but a few had necks that curved downward towards the head. However, in 2009 multiple things were found to be incorrect with this hypothesis. Michael P. Taylor et al. compared the neck posture of sauropods to that of extant reptiles, finding the habitual pose of different sauropods to be quite different from the hypothesis of Stevens and Parrish, including an upright neck for Diplodocus. The inaccuracies of Stevens and Parrish come mostly from their thought about the habitual pose, which was, according to them, the Osteological Neutral Pose (or ONP) of every sauropod. Taylor et al. find the ONP not to be the habitual pose, far from it, but just the midpoint between the two structural extremes of the neck orientation. = Incline pose = Another, more widely supported hypothesis about sauropod neck posture is that the necks were held at an incline, but not as upright as commonly shown. Daniela Schwartz et al. in 2006 published a study of the scapula and coracoids, sometimes fused into scapulocoracoids, of sauropod genera. Previously, sauropod shoulder girdles were thought to have been positioned horizontally along the torso, but Schwartz et al. found that the girdles should not have been positioned horizontally, and instead, they would have been angled at an average of 55° to 65°. The study reconstructed the skeletons of Diplodocus, Camarasaurus, and the titanosaur Opisthocoelicaudia, all known from a complete shoulder girdle, with the correct orientation of the scapulocoracoids. For Diplodocus, a 60° shoulder blade would have meant that the neck was more-or-less horizontal, not too much different from the horizontal pose. A juvenile Camarasaurus found by Gilmore was originally described as having the scapulocoracoid in \\"just the right place\\", but with it oriented at an angle of 45°, Schwartz et al. criticized the stance. The skeleton found by Schwartz et al. with the angle of the scapulocoracoid is similar to previous reconstruction of the genus by Osborn and Mook, and Jensen. Opisthocoelicaudia was found to have had two possibly poses, both with the scapulocoracoid angled at about 60°. No previous reconstructions, unlike with Camarasaurus, have restored Opisthocoelicaudia similarly. = Upright pose for some sauropods = Euhelopus and Brachiosaurus have been found to be among only a few sauropods to hold their necks at a vertical angle, which would have been impossible for other sauropods. Many studies have stated that the blood pressure and energy spent would have been too great to survive, but for Euhelopus and Brachiosaurus it would have suited them better. The energy spent by pumping blood to the head would probably be too great for sauropods, but when they travel often, which has been suggested for those two genera, it would have actually saved energy. The biomechanical evidence favours an upright neck when travelling to spread apart resources. The study finding this conclusion also tested how much energy would have been expended when walking and standing, both with an upright neck. The approximate conclusion was that an about equal amount of energy would have been used up. Elongated cervical ribs are skeletal evidence for a strong core to support the neck and limit its movement when walking. The study supports the idea that during times of drought and famine, an upright neck was crucial for these sauropods to survive.

The brick-and-granite three-story structure was built in 1844-45 to a design by Boston architect Edward Shaw, and is a prominent early example of the Gothic Revival style in a civic building. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history Manchester's City Hall is the second building of that name, the first having been built on the same site in 1841, and burned in 1844. It is prominently set in the middle of the downtown, on the west side of Elm Street at its junction with Hanover Street. It is three stories in height, built out of brick with granite trim. It presents a five-bay facade to Elm Street and a three-bay facade to Market Street (now closed off as City Hall Plaza). The center of the three-bay facade projects slightly and rises in a tower two more stories above the building. The bays of the building and its corners are articulated by false buttresses, which rise to squat octagonal columns above the roof edge. Each bay has several narrow Gothic windows rising through the second and third floors. The tower has a clock with multiple faces on its main stage above the roof, which is ringed by a crenellated balustrade and octagonal columns. The top stage consists of an open lantern structure with Gothic openings and pinnacles. The hall was designed by Edward Shaw, a New Hampshire-born architect based in Boston, Massachusetts. Shaw is best known for a number of publications for builders, some of which received wide circulation. When first built, the Elm Street facade was taken up by retail space on the ground floor (in a style emulating the previous city hall which stood on the site), with city offices above; the main entrance was then through the base of the tower. In 1895 the city took over the entire ground floor, moving the main entry to the center bay on Elm Street. The building entrance has since been relocated back to the tower.

The attack took place on the night of 15 May 2014. Background Residents of Na Nong Bong and five neighbouring villages have been embroiled in a long-running dispute with a gold mine operated by Tungkum Limited (TKL), a subsidiary of Tongkah Harbour PCL, after which they blocked the entrance road to the mine with trucks. The gold mine was accused of poisoning the villagers' land and water supplies and causing serious health problems. About 300 men, wearing balaclavas and carrying sticks, knives and guns, went on the rampage in Ban Na Nong Bong from 22:00 on 15 May to 05:00 the following day. Wearing black and white ski masks and armed with guns, knives and clubs, up to 400 men rounded up and beat 40 people, including women, in the village near the northern border with Laos. They covered villagers' eyes, bound their ankles and wrists, and beat them. They treated us like we weren't human, one villager, Pauntip Hongchai, told Reuters. Yon Khunna, who was watchman for the village on Thursday night, said the men tied his hands and beat him up for hours. \\"I was released just at 4.30am ,\\" he said. The Network of Lecturers and Students for Society and the Environment issued a statement condemning the attack. \\"This is a grave violation against human rights and community rights\\". The environmental organization, Ecological Alert and Recovery — Thailand (EARTH), has also issued a statement. Police were no help, showing up only after the fact, which didn't surprise the villagers who identified the leaders of the armed gang as Lt Gen Poramet Pomnak and his son Poramin. Loei Governor Wirot Jiwarangsan said the latest incident resulted from a conflict between the mine operator and the villagers, making it sound like an attack by 300 thugs was something to be expected. The Bangkok Post hinted at military impunity and knowledge of the upcoming 2014 Thailand coup as factors fuelling the incident. Aftermath In the village there has been little effort to restore the land and water quality to acceptable standards. The government reportedly planted a few trees that later died, and leveled the landscape. As for contaminated water, a governmental official explained that, even thought it has been proved that there is contaminated water in Ban Na Nong Bong and that villagers blood contains high levels of heavy metals, it has not been shown that this is due to gold mining. The Pollution Control Department has not confirmed the cause of contamination, despite the correlation between cyanide in the mining process and cyanide in the water. They simply point out that mining can sometimes accelerate the surfacing of dangerous metals.

He was the leading founding member of the Huddersfield Archaeological and Topographical Association, which became the Yorkshire Archaeological Society, and is now the Yorkshire Archaeological and Historical Society. The society was founded in 1863 for the purpose of funding and organising excavations at Slack Roman fort. The excavations were initially supervised and documented by Lloyd. In the 1860s and 1870s he was curate of Thurstonland in West Yorkshire, Trimdon in County Durham, Church Gresley in South Derbyshire and Cramlington in Northumberland. He was an outspoken man who once received an assassination threat, and this character trait may possibly explain why he was never ordained as a priest. Personal life George Lloyd was born in Coleshill, Warwickshire, in 1820.

Afterwards, steady weakening occurred due to upwelling beneath the storm, and Amanda fell below major hurricane intensity on May 26. Rapid weakening occurred and the cyclone eventually dissipated on May 29. The tropical cyclone did not directly impact landmasses, however it had indirect impacts along the coast of Mexico. Heavy rains caused flooding in the towns of Guerrero and Manzanillo, Mexico, resulting in 2 fatalities. A third occurred after a tree fell on a car in Acapulco. Landslides and high surf were also reported along the Mexican coastline, causing minor damage. Meteorological history  On May 16, a tropical wave emerged into the Eastern Pacific. Moving westward, the wave changed little in organization until May 19, when a broad surface low formed about south of Acapulco. The system failed to organize further over the next two days as thunderstorm activity oscillated as it continued to track westward and eventually west-northwestward. By May 22, however, scatterometer data began to indicate that the system was becoming better defined, with deep convection persisting near the center, which was getting better organized. Based on this data, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the disturbance to Tropical Depression One-E at 18:00 UTC that day while located about south-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico, although it was not operationally classified until three hours later. The depression gradually organized, with banding features developing near the center, and eventually was upgraded to a tropical storm on May 23, being assigned the name Amanda. Steered by a subtropical ridge over central Mexico, Amanda slowly moved westward against the southern periphery of the ridge. With very warm sea surface temperatures of near , a moist environment, and light wind shear, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predicted that Amanda had the potential to rapidly intensify. Indeed, Amanda then began a period of rapid intensification late on May 23, becoming a hurricane by 15:00 UTC on May 24\\\\. Banding features and a central dense overcast (CDO) continued to become better organized, and a pinhole eye was seen to develop in microwave imagery. The Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) rapid intensification index predicted a 60 percent chance that Amanda's wind speeds would increase by in 24 hours, which was about 15 times higher than the average possibility. The small eye of the cyclone continued to quickly clear, and Amanda became a major hurricane by 03:00 UTC on May 25, making it the second-earliest such storm within the National Hurricane Center's area of responsibility, only to be surpassed by Hurricane Bud from 2012. The rapid intensification eventually leveled off with Amanda reaching its peak intensity at 12:00 UTC that day as a high-end Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson scale. Winds were estimated at 155 mph (250 km/h) and the minimum pressure at 932 mbar (hPa; 27.52 inHg). Because Amanda had been moving slowly over nearly the same areas as it had before, the hurricane began upwelling waters from below, with sea surface temperatures dropping by 6 °C underneath it. Amanda maintained its peak intensity for 6 hours before it began to steadily weaken due to the upwelled waters. However, a more rapid phase of weakening began due to increasing wind shear and decreasing sea surface temperatures of less than . By May 27, Amanda had fallen below major hurricane intensity, and despite slightly redeveloping its CDO, Amanda continued to rapidly weaken due to dry air, degrading to a tropical storm on May 28\\\\. The circulation then became elongated, and Amanda later dissipated the next day. Impact and records Under the anticipation of heavy rains and landslides, a \\"blue\\" alert was declared for Guerrero. An alert was issued for Manzanillo. Thirty-four shelters opened in Michoacán while 80 opened in Guerrero. Heavy rains occurred in Guerrero, resulting in flooding. A river near Coyuca de Benítez overflowed its banks. Three trees were brought down and a vehicle in Acapulco was destroyed. Statewide, one person was killed when a tree that had fallen on the road resulted in a fatal car wreck. In Colima, minor landslides occurred, resulting in the closure of Federal Highway 200. Much of Michoacán was battered by large waves and heavy rains, resulting in two casualties. Several roads were destroyed in Zitácuaro. On May 25, Amanda became the second- earliest East Pacific major hurricane on record, behind 2012's Hurricane Bud. Later that day, it also became the strongest May tropical cyclone in the Eastern Pacific basin in the satellite era, eclipsing the previous record set by Hurricane Adolph in 2001, which had peak winds of 145 mph (230 km/h).

Political life A son of LeRoy Charles Smallenberger (born 1850) and the former Dora Schnet of Peoria, Illinois, Smallenberger graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign and then in 1938 from the Louisiana State University Law Center in Baton Rouge. He was a bankruptcy judge for the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana in Shreveport from November 2, 1954, until his retirement on August 8, 1986. He and his first wife, the former Thelma Mounce, had one son, LeRoy, Jr. (1936-2007). In 1995, Smallenberger married his secretary, the former Doris Margaret McFerren (1934-2018). According to the website The Political Graveyard, Smallenberger came to Shreveport prior to 1948. In 1956, he was practicing law in his Smallenberger, Eatman & Morgan firm. He was an alternate delegate to both the 1948 Republican National Convention, held in Philadelphia, and the 1952 conclave, which met in Chicago. Prior to the state chairmanship, Smallenberger, a Republican since 1938, had been GOP chairman in Louisiana's 4th congressional district, then represented by the Democrat Overton Brooks. Beginning in 1988, the district switched to Republican representation. In 1959, Smallenberger and the Louisiana national committeeman, George W. Reese, Jr., of New Orleans, the party's 1960 nominee for the United States Senate against Allen J. Ellender, became involved in an intraparty feud with Tom Stagg, a Shreveport Republican lawyer and subsequent judge of the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, and Charles T. Beaird, the later publisher of the defunct Shreveport Journal. Stagg objected when Reese endorsed, with Smallenberger in agreement, a slate of candidates for party position on both the state and parish committees. Stagg described Reese as having attempted to assemble a group of \\"yes-men\\" and had hence \\"earned the enmity of a large number of fair-minded Republicans\\".\\"GOP Faction Fight Erupts Over Primary: 4th District Head Charges Attempt to Pack Committee\\", The Shreveport Times, December 2, 1959, p. 1 Reese, however, defended his endorsements, most of whom won their primary races, on the premise that he as a statewide party leader was obligated to recommend suitable candidates to rank-and-file voters.\\"Endorsements Defended by GOP Leader: Reese answers attack by Stagg as Faction Fight\\", The Shreveport Times, December 3, 1959, pp. 1, 4 At the time, Reese appointed Smallenberger as the \\"assistant national committeeman for North Louisiana\\".\\"Attorney Here Appointed to GOP Position\\", The Shreveport Times, December 2, 1959, p. 4-A Smallenger was an alternate delegate to the 1960 Republican National Convention and supported the party nominee, Vice President Richard M. Nixon, in the 1960 presidential election against U.S. Senator John F. Kennedy. Smallenberger said that the original Republican platform was conservative but it was moved to the left when Nixon offered concessions to Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York in a bid for support on the East Coast,\\"GOP Platform Told to Men's Club Monday\\", Minden Herald, Minden, Louisiana, October 20, 1960, p. 1 areas which Nixon still lost in the 1960 general election. William M. Rainach, a state senator from Claiborne Parish who was a delegate to the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, agreed with Smallenberger. In Rainach's words, \\"the Republican platform is not quite as bad\\" as that offered by the Kennedy/Johnson forces. Rainach said that the influence of Rockefeller had reduced the practical usefulness of the Republican Party to southern conservatives. Rainach added that if unpledged electors had gained sufficient support across the South, as they did in Mississippi and Alabama, he would have urged negotiations among the electors themselves, rather than having the U.S. House of Representatives choose the president with one vote per state in event of a deadlock in the electoral college. Were the House to have chosen a president in 1961, Kennedy would have been an automatic winner because the majority of state delegations were then in Democrat hands, Rainach said.\\"Demo Platform Lashed by Former State Senator\\", Minden Herald, October 6, 1960, p. 1 Though the Louisiana Republican Party coalesced behind Nixon in 1960 and 1968, it could not deliver the state to him until the 1972 campaign, when Nixon also won forty-eight other states.

John H. Blake of New York constructed his rifle in response to the fact that very few domestic designs were submitted to US Army rifle trials (1890–93). The rotary magazine was unique because it was detachable, whereas other rifles at the time using similar type of feed used non-detachable rotary magazines (Savage M1892). As such the detachable magazine was often described as a packet, or en-bloc clip, due to the lack of a more proper term at the time. History Blake submitted two of his rifles to the trials, both were chambered in .30 Blake cartridge - a rimless version of the .30-40 Krag cartridge. On August 19, 1892 Army Board recommended the Norwegian Krag- Jørgensen rifle to be adopted as the new service rifle. American designers were against the Army's adoption of a foreign design. In support of the designers' view Congress demanded additional trials be conducted before any funds were to be authorized for the production of the Norwegian rifle. The additional trials were not only to include only domestically made rifles, but also a new board. The new board was appointed on March 1, 1893 and the trials commenced on April 7, 1893. The two rifles were again submitted, the board decided that Blake's design was unfit for military service due to the feed system. Despite the additional trials the Krag-Jørgensen rifle was still favoured over other designs. In 1895 Blake submitted his design to US Navy rifle trials, his rifle lost to Lee's design. Variants Blake after failed attempts to convince both the Army and the Navy to adopt his design, decided to try selling his rifle on the civilian market. The Blake Rifle Book of 1899 lists rifles (28 in. barrel), carbines (20 in. barrel) and a sporting rifle (30 in. barrel). Rifles and carbines were offered in .236 Navy with rifling of one turn in 6.5 in., in .30-40 Krag and .303 with rifling of one turn in 9 in. to one turn in 12 in.. The sporting rifle was offered in .400 Blake cartridge, with rifling of one turn in 12 in. to one turn in 18 in. Additionally there were also four grades of hunting rifles: grade A - priced from 100 USD upward, compressed steel barrel, it was guaranteed to hit 4-in. circle at 200 yards with smokeless powder and 6-in. circle at 200 yards with black powder, imported walnut stock, engravings and checkered stock grade B - priced 80 USD, nickel steel barrel, it was guaranteed to hit 5-in. circle at 200 yards with smokeless powder and an 8-in. circle at 200 yards with black powder, engravings and checkered stock grade C - priced 60 USD, rest as grade B grade D - priced 50 USD, rest as grade B but no engravings or checkered stock References * Walter, John.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Fernyak qualified for the Slovak squad, as a 31-year-old, in the men's welterweight class (66 kg) by rounding out the top 10 spots from the 2003 World Wrestling Championships in New York City, New York, United States. He was placed by a random draw into a three-man preliminary pool against Turkey's Ömer Çubukçu and Hungary's Gábor Hatos. At the end of the pool, Fernyak could not generate a blistering record from Sydney with two straight losses each to Cubukcu (1–5) and Hatos (1–3) on two technical points, finishing only in third place and sixteenth overall in the final standings.

She is a federal deputy in the LXIII Legislature of the Mexican Congress, representing the 16th district of the State of Mexico. Life Maya Pineda, who holds a degree in economics from the UNAM, began her public service career in 1993 as an auditor in the municipality of Ecatepec. Her political career, however, began in the National Action Party, of which she was an active member until 2001. She served as a campaign coordinator for a PAN federal deputy campaign in 1991 and 1997, as a district-level campaign coordinator in the 1994 elections, and on the PAN campaign team for the 1996 municipal elections in Ecatepec. She also was a candidate for alternate federal deputy in 1997. Her break with the party came in 2001, when she and several other legislators broke ranks with state party leader Francisco Gárate Chapa, initially becoming an independent. She was a local deputy to the LIV Legislature of the Congress of the State of Mexico between 2000 and 2003, when she left the chamber to run for and win a seat on the city council of Ecatepec under a PRI banner in which future Governor Eruviel Ávila was the mayoral candidate. The PRI then designated her as candidate for federal deputy to the LIX Legislature of the Mexican Congress from the 13th district, and she won in a race where turnout plunged to 30 percent in some areas; she had thus been elected to two public offices in under 120 days, and three over a period of three years. In her first term in San Lázaro, between 2003 and 2006, she sat on the Commission for Care of Vulnerable Groups, as well as the Youth and Sports Commission. In 2006, she began serving on a foundation, ISAMAY para la Gestión Social A.C., which she presided for eight years. Her career in the PRI flared up again in the early 2010s, serving as a local and regional delegate, and for the 2011 gubernatorial elections in the State of Mexico, she served as a regional coordinator of public relations. Voters in the 16th district, which includes parts of Ecatepec, sent Maya Pineda back to the Chamber of Deputies for the LXIII Legislature in 2015. She serves on commissions for Human Rights, Care for Vulnerable Groups, and Strengthening of Federalism.

Biography Addison Burkhardt’s birth name was Abraham; he was the sixth of seven children of Ethel and Jacob Burkhardt, Russian Jews who immigrated to America in the late 1860s.See the 1880, 1900 and 1910 U. S. Federal Census; entries disagree about the year of immigration. Abraham was born in Washington, D. C., but he was raised first in New York and then, after 1884, in Chicago.World War I Draft Registration Card (Addison Burkhardt); 1880 U. S. Federal Census; Tinnee; 1890 and 1892 Chicago Voter Registration (Jacob Burkhardt). Jacob Burkhardt died on January 16, 1893, and by 1895 Abraham had left school to work for a law firm, studying at night to qualify for the bar.U. S. Passport Application for Max L. Burkhardt, April 15, 1919; The ASCAP Biographical Dictionary; Chicago City Directory, 1895. At the turn of the century he gave up that profession for the entertainment business and, using the forename Addison, scored his first successes in 1902. He kept the new name for the rest of his life. On January 8, 1907, Addison Burkhardt married Josephine Kasparek in Chicago; they had no children.Cook County, Illinois, Marriage Index; 1930 U. S. Federal Census. Although much of his career was based in Chicago, Burkhardt had moved to New York before the marriage, and he continued to reside there until at least 1920.“Addison Burkhart”; New York City Directories; 1910 and 1920 U. S. Federal Census. He traveled to Europe at least once, assessing and acquiring shows with the producer Mort Singer in 1912.“Mort Singer Goes Abroad,” The Billboard 24:24 (June 15, 1912), p. 6 He worked closely with his brothers Charles and Max, both of whom were in the entertainment business; for Charles he wrote sketches, and with Max he briefly opened his own publishing house in 1918.”Burkhardt Opens Office,” The New York Clipper LXVI:6 (March 13, 1918), p. 12. The publishing venture failed, and Burkhardt’s New York career began to wane; in 1923 he was recruited by Fox films and moved to California.”Burkhardt-Horwitz Closes,” The New York Clipper LXVI:29 (August 21, 1913), p. 17. In Los Angeles Burkhardt anglicized his name further by dropping the “d”; he had done so occasionally before, but with increasing regularity after the start of World War I.Los Angeles City Directory, 1924; U. S. Federal Census, 1930; various film credits. Under his new name (sometimes also “Burkhard”) Burkhart worked for Fox for a few years; then he wrote scripts and adaptations for Warner Brothers and RKO, continuing to write and revise stage work occasionally.”Broadway Knows Collaborators,” The Los Angeles Times, December 29, 1928, p. A11. After 1932 his health declined, and Burkhart was in retirement at his death.“Obituaries,” Variety CXXV:7 (January 27, 1937), p. 62. Career Burkhardt’s career can be divided into three parts. The first, from 1902 until 1914, was centered in Chicago, where Burkhardt authored the librettos for a series of very successful productions. The second, based in New York, was devoted primarily to vaudeville routines, sketches, and lyrics for individual songs. The third was in California, where Burkhart worked primarily in film. Burkhardt’s first libretto was for Chow Chow, renamed The Runaways; a substantial hit, the music was written by Raymond Hubbell and published by Charles K. Harris, to whom Burkhardt was already contracted.Advertisement, The New York Clipper, August 9, 1902, p. 520 Then came The Jolly Baron, with a score by Harry Von Tilzer, also a success. Both shows opened in Chicago and then toured extensively. By 1907 Burkhardt had left Harris and joined the more prestigious firm of M. Witmark & Sons.“M. Witmark & Sons,” The New York Clipper LV:1 (February 23, 1907), p. 9 Now based in New York, he wrote lyrics and sketches for revues that included The Mimic World (1908 and 1909) and Florenz Ziegfeld's Miss Innocence (1908).\\"'Mimic World' in Philly,\\" Variety XI:3 (June 27, 1908), p. 4; \\"Roosevelt’s Trip to Africa,” Chicago Daily Tribune, September 20, 1908, p. B6; \\"My Postcard Girl,\\" The Boston Globe, March 6, 1910, p. SM15. In Chicago he became associated with Harry Askin, who took over the La Salle Theater in 1910. The Sweetest Girl in Paris opened the new house; a vehicle for Trixie Friganza, it had an impressive run and toured for two more years.\\"The Theatre,\\" The Rock Island Argus, February 1, 1911, p. 3 It was followed by the even more successful Louisiana Lou (1912), with a cast led by Sophie Tucker.“Frisco Acclaims Geo. Evans,” The Player V:33, July 19, 1912, p. 21. Both these shows, and many other of Burkhardt’s scripts and vaudeville routines, incorporated comic Jewish characters, depicted by stereotypical performers like Alexander Carr and Samuel Liebert. Quite possibly Burkhardt’s skill in delineating these derived from the cultural experiences of his youth. A final Chicago show, One Girl in a Million (1914) was also a success but effectively marked the end of Burkhardt's musical comedy career.\\"At the Theatres,\\" The Urbana Courier-Herald, December 14, 1914, p. 3. Thereafter Burkhardt wrote one-act plays, extended vaudeville sketches, and individual songs. He had written skits for his brother Charles from the beginning; a 1913 one-act, “The Cheap Skate,” proved especially popular.Tinnee; “Wilson Avenue,” The Billboard 25:7 (February 15, 1913), p. 12. Other successes were the “Demi Tasse Review,” written for Isabelle D’Armond, and A Shattered Idol, for Samuel Liebert, billed as “a one-act play of Jewish life.”“Colonial, New York,” The Billboard 28:26 (June 17, 1916), p. 7; advertisement, The New York Clipper, June 3, 1916, p. 21. Burkhardt had already written individual songs in collaboration with prominent figures like Will Marion Cook and Gus Edwards.Catalog of Copyright Entries ... Musical Compositions (Washington: Government Printing Office), 1906, 1910. In 1915 he wrote “Israel,” with Fred Fisher, for Settling Accounts, a play by Clara Lipman and Samuel Shipman; and, with Abe Olman, he wrote “All I Need is Just a Girl Like You,” which was popular enough to be interpolated in the London production of Louisiana Lou.“Only Song in Play,” The New York Clipper 53:45 (December 18, 1915), p. 30; “Burkhardt Piece for London,” The New York Clipper LXV:34 (September 26, 1917), p. 14 After 1917, Burkhardt, like many popular composers, turned to war-time themes; his “All Aboard for Home, Sweet Home,” with music by Tin Pan Alley stalwarts Al Piantadosi and Jack Glogau, was a moderate success, while “Let’s Bury the Hatchet in the Kaiser’s Head,” to which he wrote his own music, was not. Thereafter Burkhardt (now often Burkhart) seems to have lost his touch. His publishing firm failed in less than a year, and a review of his 1918 sketch, “Work or Fight,” concluded that “the turn in its present form looks hopeless.”“Burkhardt-Horwitz Closes,” The New York Clipper LXVI:29 (August 21, 1918), p. 17; ”Herbert Ashley and Co.”, Variety 52:7 (October 11, 1918), p. 11. With tastes changing, Burkhart, like many other entertainers, moved west. He worked on silent films for Fox for several years, culminating in the scenarios for eight short comedies directed by Harold Lloyd and starring Edward Everett Horton.”Broadway Knows Collaborators,” Los Angeles Times, December 20, 1928, p.

He seemed poised for a new round of success when illness forced his retirement in 1932. Burkhardt was not an innovator, but he worked consistently to maintain the high reputation gained with his early musical comedies. He showed remarkable flexibility in adjusting to shifts in taste and media, changing genre and location as circumstances required.

Early life  Ellis was the only male of eight children born to Jay Bartlett Ellis, MD (born 1852), and Antonette Roberts (née Hall; 1856–1896), who were married in Elkhart, Indiana, May 28, 1875. Between 9 and 16 years of age, James G. Ellis lost six of his siblings—Pauline (died 1892), Jennie (1876–1889), Maud (1878–1896), Clara (1885–1888), Mary Winnifred (1887–1888), Mabel (1889–1991)—and also lost his mother, all to complications from diphtheria. His father became a homeopathic physician in 1891. His only surviving sister, Helen (1882–1965) became a nurse. Helen married someone with the surname Russell and then John Joseph Allen, MD (187–1948). James G. Ellis' maternal grandfather, John Wood Ellis (1825–1917) was, among other things, an industrialist executive with the Excelsior Starch Mfg. Co. of Elkhart, Indiana. When James G. Ellis was 17, he gained a stepbrother, John F. McNair (1888–1956) when his father married Jennie Althea Standifird McNair (1867–1952) in Minneapolis on March 1, 1897. He lived during his childhood at 1212 Wayne Street, Dayton, Ohio. Ellis served in U.S. Army in the Spanish–American War (1898). Personal life James G. Ellis was married three times. He first married Edna Lenore Roberts (1884–1987) in Merced County, California, November 27, 1902. They had two daughters, Althea Claire Ellis (1909–2005), who never married, and Ruth M. Ellis (born 1917). Ruth married Howard Paul Boyington (born 1927) in Los Angeles, California on April 4, 1966; but she formerly had married a man with the surname of Baker. James and Edna Ellis divorced sometime between January 7, 1920, and June 9, 1921, when Edna married Robert Hassett in Lake County, Indiana. Edna and James lived in Los Banos, California in 1903. They lived at 4349 W. West End Avenue, near Kostner Avenue, Chicago between 1917 and 1920. According to the 1920 U.S. Census, Robert Hassett had been a boarder in his and his wife's home. Sometime between January 7, 1920, and 1930, James G. Ellis married Anna G. Long (born 1876). In 1930 Ellis lived at 1090 St Andrews Place, Los Angeles and in 1940 lived at 2711 W. 14th Street, Los Angeles. When Ellis died in 1966, he was survived by this third wife, Phyllis Ellis, who was a music teacher. At the time of his death he lived in Los Angeles at 611 N. Larchmont Boulevard.  Career  = Silent film theaters = Ellis started out as a silent film theater entrepreneur in Utah Ellis had managed and controlled 3 movie theaters from 1909 to 1910, then sold them to individuals, including W.W. Hodkinson, who four years later was the founding president of Paramount Pictures. Ellis and his father, who had been working at the Joie Theater in Ogden, purchased the Globe Theater in Ogden on October 1, 1909. Ellis, as the new manager of the Globe, installed a stage in late November 1909 for the inclusion of vaudeville acts for movie audiences. Ellis then moved his family from Ogden to Brigham, Utah, leaving the management of the Joie Theater to his father. In July 1909, Ellis, with at least one other partner, acquired Dreamland Theatre, located 2410 Washington Avenue, and renamed it the Joie Theater. Ellis, who had been profitable in the venture, sold his interest on December 28, 1909, to Harry Ambrose Sims (1864–1921), William Wadsworth Hodkinson (1881–1971), Albert Scowcroft (1871–1918), and Charles Alexander Ziemer (1864–1929). Ellis and his wife then moved to Salt Lake City. On March 22, 1910, Ellis filed articles of incorporation in Salt Lake County for the Ellis Theater Company, taking over the Joy theater in Brigham, the Orpheum in Park City and the Luna in Springville. The officers were James G. Ellis, president; Max M. Florence (1865–1932), vice president; John Alphonso Rugar (1883–1970), secretary, treasurer; and Soren X. Christensen (1866–1942) and Louis B. Marcus (1880–1936) as additional directors. On May 5, 1910, Max M. Florence (1865–1932) and Joseph Falsette (born 1880) purchased outright the Ellis Theater Company and changed the name to Florence Theater Company. =Composer, lyricist, and music publisher= Ellis, as a popular songwriter in Chicago from 1910 to 1920, had some minor hits that include \\"The Tale the Tear Drop Told\\" and \\"I Am Dreaming Of My Irish Rose\\". As a music publisher during that same period, Ellis published his own compositions, as well as those of others, including works by Roger A. Graham and Harry L. Alford. Ellis had been a principal partner in five Chicago firms from 1913 to about 1920: (i) The Ellis & Armitage Music Publishing Company, (ii) Ellis & Co., (iiii) Craig-Ellis & Co., (iv) Acme Music Publishers, and (v) Phenix Music Publishers. As a songwriter of sacred music, beginning around 1917, he became an exponent of Christian Science and, around 1920, became a Christian Science practitioner. Some of his sacred works endure today, particularly within Church of Christ (Science) congregations, including \\"Transfiguration\\", \\"Leave It With Him\\", \\"Rejoice, My Son, Rejoice\\", and \\"Love, Thrill My Heart\\". Sometime between 1920 and 1930, Ellis moved to California. Ellis published the works of Roger A. Graham and Harry L. Alford.

History  The idea of founding a Jewish museum emerged in the late 1970s and was based on two motifs: the lack of a Jewish museum dealing with history and art, although Judaism has been present in Belgium since the Middle Ages, and the small number of public collections. As part of the celebrations surrounding Belgium's 150th birthday in 1979, Baron Bloch, then President of the Central Council and alongside his successor in office, Baron Schnek, suggested driving exhibition of art and history of Belgian Jewry. The event was successful, and a small group was founded in 1981 which put together a collection as well as a financing basis and the purchase of a property. Official support was finally gained in the mid-1980s. Initially, the Ministry of Labor and Finance, later also the French and Flemish-speaking communities and the regions agreed to support the group's efforts. Work continued on makeshift premises above the Beth Israel Synagogue on Rue de Stalingrad (Stalingradstraat), which were provided by the Central Council. The museum has been compiling its collection since 1990 and installed its first permanent exhibition there. In 2005, the company moved to its current premises on Rue des Minimes (Miniemenstraat). Museum and collections The museum has a collection of items which relate to Jewish customs from Europe, Asia, and Africa, dating back as far as the 18th century and mostly from the region to the east of river Rhine and countries around the Mediterranean. The museum has 750 objects of judaica, 1,250 works of art, and an archive of 20,000 photographs, 5,000 posters, compact discs, LPs, and compact cassettes. The museum also has six thematic libraries containing a total of 25,000 works and editions, including works in Yiddish and Hebrew, works of Jewish artists, and genealogies.  Shooting  On 24 May 2014, four peopletwo visiting Israelis and two people who worked at the museumwere killed in a shooting at the museum.

The devotion consisted on the act of yielding oneself prisoner to the Mother of God - of subjection to her will. Each slave of Mary had also the duty of praying a litany in the morning and evening and an office on Saturday. The sign of the slavery was a fetters-shaped chainlet with the inscription ego mancipium Mariae.

It is popular as a place for boating and fishing, and has a wide variety of wildlife. As the state's fourth largest natural lake, it has over of surface water, and consists of three basins. Its water quality is ranked among the best in Indiana lakes. The lake is the largest of a group of lakes known as the James Lake Chain. These lakes are located mostly in Steuben County, Indiana, but also extend into southern Michigan. During the 1700s the lake was part of a huge swamp that was the hunting grounds for the Potawatomi Indians. As European fur traders made wild game scarce, the Indians were persuaded to sell their land and move west. Pokagon State Park, located along all three of the lake's basins, is named in honor of two Potawatomi leaders: Simon Pokagon and his father Leopold. The park, with grounds of more than , is open all year. Camping sites are available, and the park features hiking trails, a toboggan, and two beaches. The park's Potawatomi Inn faces the north side of the lake's lower basin. Lake James was named by surveyor James Watson Riley. It was first surveyed in 1831 by E. H. Lytle, and settlement began shortly thereafter. Settlement around the lake was initially slow, as there were no roads that provided access. The construction of a small railroad between the city of Angola and the lake's southern tip spurred development, as visitors could ride a train to Angola and connect to the lake. After arriving at the lake by train, many of the original cottage owners took a boat to their cottage. With the exception of Pokagon State Park and a private campground, nearly all of the lake's shoreline is now developed. Much of the development consists of cottages and homes, which began over 100 years ago. Two additional lakes of significant size, Jimmerson Lake and Snow Lake, are connected to Lake James. Water from these lakes flows west, and eventually reaches Lake Michigan. Description Lake James is a glacial lake located in the northeastern corner of the state of Indiana. The lake occupies an area west of Interstate highway 69 in Indiana's Steuben County, which borders Michigan and Ohio. The city of Angola is located about southeast of the lake's southern tip. The northern half of Lake James is in the county's Jamestown Township, while the southern half is located in Pleasant Township. The lake consists of three sections called the First, Second, and Third Basin, where the First Basin is the southernmost and the Third Basin is the northernmost of the three. Snow Lake lies on the north side of the Third (northern) Basin. Although a separate lake today, it was described as one of \\"four portions\\" of Lake James in a report from the early 20th century. Vegetation effectively separated Snow Lake from Lake James around the end of the 19th century. As Indiana's fourth largest natural lake, Lake James is large enough to be the site of a state park and multiple boat ramps. The lake has a surface area of , and about of shoreline. Its elevation is . The lake's mean depth is . All three basins are deepest in their center, and the deepest part of the lake is . All three basins also have sunken islands, and an island in the First Basin remains above the water level. The island located in the First Basin is about from the shore on the south side of the lake. During the early 20th century it was known as Kemery Island. It has one cottage, a pier, and several trees. Lake James has two other islands that might be more appropriately described as an islet and a tidal island. A small islet can be found near what was Bledsoe's Beach on the west side of the Second Basin near Jimmerson Creek. This tiny island is unofficially known as Goat Island. The small piece of land was not originally an island, but became one as erosion created a channel on its west side. Beginning in 1969, and continuing into the 1970s, goats were left on the island during the summer to \\"mow\\" the vegetation. The practice of using goats to groom the island was discontinued later in the 1970s, but locals still call the tiny piece of land \\"Goat Island\\". The lake's Third Basin has a residential subdivision known as Eagle Island. This tidal island is located on the north side of the Third Basin, and is connected to the mainland by wetlands and marshes. A group of about 10 cottages on the island are accessed via a causeway. Lake James is also the name of an unincorporated community situated on the western side of the lake. The town established a post office in 1851, but was discontinued that same year. History alt=Old Native American manMost of the native Potawatomi Indians left the region in 1830. Lake James and the surrounding area was originally surveyed in 1831 by E. H. Lytle. The lake was named by another surveyor, James Riley. It is not certain if Riley was Captain James Riley or his son, James Watson Riley—both were surveyors. James Watson Riley also had a son, James Watson Riley Jr. It is not known why the lake was named Lake James, but a logical assumption is that the name honors one (or more) of the three James Riley men. =First inhabitants= The oldest known people with sustained civilizations in Indiana are the Woodland Indians. These mound builders lived in what would become Indiana from approximately 1,000 BC to 900 AD. These Native American tribes disappeared, and were replaced by other tribes during the 1700s. In future northeast Indiana, the new tribes were the Miami and Potawatomi Indians. The Lake James area was the hunting grounds of the Potawatomi Indians, who managed the land and wildlife with periodic controlled burns. Following an 1830 treaty, most of the Potawatomi moved west, although the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, led by Leopold Pokagon, negotiated an agreement that enabled them to stay in southern Michigan. Pokagon State Park, located on Lake James, is named in honor of chief Leopold Pokagon and his son Simon. The park's size is and is adjacent to all three basins of Lake James—and Lake Snow. The park has two beaches with swimming areas on Lake James. One beach is located in front of the park's Potawatomi Inn, which faces the north side of the lake's First (or Lower) Basin. The other beach (and bath house) can be found on the southeastern shore of the lake's Third (or Upper) Basin. =Settlement= Settlement of the area started after the surveys of the 1830s, but the population growth was slow because access roads were limited. The nearby community of Jamestown had a population of only 779 by 1870. In 1875 Lake James was described as \\"remarkably clear and free from mineral matter\\" with water having a \\"pleasant taste\\" and \\"neutral to litmus paper\\". By that time, the lake was well known for good fishing. Cottages began appearing on Lake James during the end of the 19th century. A portion of Spring Point, located on the west side of the lake where the First and Second basins meet, was platted in 1895. Settlement accelerated when an electric railway connected the city of Angola with the southernmost shore of the lake's First Basin, known as Paltytown. =Railway= alt= Train schedule advertised in Fort Wayne Journal Gazette in 1914.The Ohio & Indiana Railway Company was incorporated in 1903. During the same year, a line was built from the New York Central Railroad station in the nearby city of Angola to the southern tip of Lake James. Following difficulties in acquiring rolling stock, additional financial backers joined the company and renamed it the Angola Railway and Power Company—although the railroad was always known as the Lake James Electric Railway. Rolling stock totaled only three pieces of equipment: two electric passenger cars and an open trailer. Regular passenger service began on July 14, 1904. The railroad closed during the winter months and typically provided service from April until November. The line was lengthened by in 1904, connecting Angola's New York Central station with the heart of the business district. The company also built a dance hall, hotel, and amusement park at Paltytown. By 1914 Paltytown was described as \\"several cottages, a supply store, a photograph gallery and dancing pavilion, and the Lake James Hotel.\\" Two piers were located at the beach, and boats were available for rent. In many cases, people reached their cottages on the lake by taking a train to Angola and then taking the electric railway to the lake. From Paltytown, they could reach their cottage by boat. The Lake James Electric Railway was rarely profitable and never expanded after the 1904 extension. A reorganized version of the company was renamed Indiana Utilities Company in 1912. The last regularly-scheduled trip made by the railroad was on October 15, 1918. The railroad was dismantled and its properties sold in 1919. The Paltytown properties were sold in 1922. Better roads and the automobile made the railroad obsolete, but it played a key role in the lake's development. In 1928 another group agreed to purchase the Paltytown properties, and the former resort became the Lake James Christian Assembly. =Mail= In 1927 the United States Postal Service announced that it would provide mail delivery service to lake front residents of Lake James using boats. Delivery by boat was provided all summer, six days per week. By the 1950s, Lake James was thought to be the only \\"fresh-water delivery route on an inland lake in the United States with a cottage-to-cottage delivery by speedboat.\\" Summer service was provided from June 1 through September 15 to lakefront properties with mailboxes at the end of their piers. About 200 residences received letters, packages, and newspapers. Stamps were sold directly from the boat. During peak times, delivery could take as long as four hours using a boat powered by a 25-horsepower motor. =Bledsoe's Beach= Postcard for Bledsoe's Beach circa 1930-45\\\\. Part of alt= Old postcard with lake, piers, and people relaxing.Bledsoe's Beach, located on Lake James near its intersection with Jimmerson Lake, became a popular nightspot during the 20th century. The resort eventually included a dance hall, a cocktail lounge, a hotel, a pier and swimming area, a golf course, and a recreational vehicle park. Beginning in the 1960s, Bledsoe's Beach was also the summer home of the Hoosier Basketball Camp, which was originally directed by Indiana University basketball coach Branch McCracken. In 1938 advertisements for Bledsoe's Beach proclaimed \\"dancing every Saturday Night\\". Ten years later, advertisements were proclaiming dancing every night except Monday. During the early 1960s Bledsoe's Beach was described as \\"the Midwest's Favorite Fun Spot\\", with live music and record hops featuring disc jockeys from radio station WOWO, one of the most powerful radio stations in the Midwest. In 2011 the property was sold at auction. A restaurant opened on the site in 2013 with lake views and dock space for customers arriving by boat. =Major accidents= Lake James has been the site of a plane crash and a rare hang gliding fatality. In 1971 a Piper Tri-Pacer crashed into Lake James, killing the pilot. The plane was flying at low altitude when a wing hit the water about from the shore. The wing was torn off, and the plane plunged into water about deep. Another fatality happened in 1972, when a hang-glider was killed. The kite was being pulled by a boat when the flyer lost control, causing the kite (and flyer) to plummet about before striking the surface of the lake. The lake has also been the site of accidents involving thin ice. An example transpired in January 1985 when four snowmobiles broke through thin ice, and three people drowned. Watershed alt=Map of lake with 3 basins Lake James and other lakes nearby were formed by glaciers approximately 10,000 years ago near the end of the Pleistocene era. Many northern Indiana lakes were formed as pieces of large glaciers broke off and became buried in the land as the main glaciers retreated north. Eventually, these large pieces of ice melted and filled the depressions in the land they originally occupied, creating numerous lakes and marshes. Lake James has a catchment area of . Its primary tributaries are Croxton Ditch, the Sowles Bay inlet, and the Whisper Bay inlet. Croxton Ditch is the largest, and flows into the First Basin from the south side at a rate of . The Sowles Bay and Whisper Bay inlets also flow into the Lower Basin, entering from the southeast and west sides, respectively. The Whisper Bay inlet flows at , while the inlet at Sowles Bay flows at . The primary inflow for the Third Basin is a short channel from Snow Lake on the basin's north side. Water from the First and Third basins flows to the Second Basin, where it exits the lake on the west side through a short channel named Jimmerson Creek that enters Jimmerson Lake. The lake's mean hydraulic retention time is 312 days. =James chain= Lake James is part of the James Lake Chain which consists of a group of glacial lakes located in the northeastern corner of Indiana and part of Michigan. Lake James is the largest lake in this group of lakes, and also the fourth largest natural lake in Indiana. The drainage basin for this chain of lakes is . The northern boundary of this region is the community of Kinderhook, Michigan, and the southern boundary is just north of Angola, Indiana. The eastern boundary is on the east side of Fremont, Indiana, and the western side is just west of Lake James. Most of this region is within Indiana's Steuben County. The James Lake Chain watershed drains westward through the Middle Basin of Lake James into Jimmerson Lake, which is part of another watershed. Water from Jimmerson Lake continues westward over a dam at Nevada Mills, forming Crooked Creek. This creek flows northwest, becoming the Fawn River. Eventually, the Fawn River joins the St. Joseph River, which empties into Lake Michigan near the city of Constantine, Michigan. Water quality The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classified Lake James as a mesotrophic lake in 1973, meaning that it had an intermediate level of nutrient enrichment. The EPA sampled the lake's water in May, August, and October of that year. Water temperature for Lake James ranged from in early August, and averaged for all of the samples taken that day. The lake's pH ranged between 7.3 and 8.5, with an average of 7.8. Dissolved oxygen is necessary for fish and other water organisms, and most fish need 3 to 5 milligrams per liter. The concentration of dissolved oxygen in Lake James ranged from 0.0 to 8.8 milligrams per liter for various depths during early August, and averaged 4.6. Nutrients such as phosphorus and forms of nitrogen are essential for plants, yet excess amounts can result in lower dissolved oxygen. The EPA found the phosphorus concentration in Lake James ranged from 0.013 to 0.219 milligrams per liter, and averaged 0.040. Total concentration of nitrogen in the lake's waters ranged from 0.540 to 1.890 milligrams per liter, with a mean of 1.007. The concentration of ammonia ranged from 0.040 to 1.22 milligrams per liter, and had a mean average of 0.250. Another measure of water quality is Secchi Disk Transparency. This measure is the depth at which a Secchi disk can be seen, and the depth is reduced by particles in the water such as algae and sediment. The Sechhi depth of the lake averaged in August, although the depth was deeper in May and October. The overall water quality for Lake James ranked 3rd best of the 27 Indiana lakes tested by the EPA that year. The mesotrophic classification was confirmed in 2005 by additional studies. During the ten years prior to 2006, a new waste water plant was constructed, connecting nearly all the homes on Lake James to off-site waste treatment facilities. This removes a significant portion of nutrient loading in the lake, and should have a positive impact on future water quality. Climate Historical weather data is available for Angola, Indiana, which is about from Lake James. Angola averages about 7.5 days when the high temperature is or higher. It also typically has about 13.3 days when the low temperature is or lower. The record high temperature is , which was recorded in 1936. The record low temperature is , which happened in 1981. Northern Indiana lakes freeze during the winter, usually for periods between November 15 and March 15. In a study of Lake James conducted during the 1940s, Lake James was covered by ice from December 15, 1947, to March 21, 1948. The ice reached a maximum thickness of at that time. During the study's previous two winters, ice reached a maximum thickness of . Plants and animals =Around the lake= alt= Side view woodpecker with a red head, white belly, and black and white wings.Lake James supports a variety of plants and animals, as it has woodlands and wetlands adjacent to its waters. Pokagon State Park, originally named Lake James State Park when it was proposed in 1925, is located by the lake. As of 2003, the park's forest consists of sugar and red maple trees, and has an average density of 155 trees per . The park has its own swamps and marshes—and many are spring fed. A variety of animals can be found in the park and surrounding area. A partial list of animals found locally includes Blanding's turtles, northern leopard frogs, massasauga rattle-snakes, and the star-nosed mole. White-tailed deer and raccoons have high enough populations that they have to be managed. Beavers, coyotes, and foxes can also be found. Lake James and the surrounding lakes are the home for a variety of birds. Common birds such as ducks, geese, gulls, and purple martins can be found when the lake is not frozen. Migrating birds such as loons, grebes, and double- crested cormorants can also be observed, typically during autumn. Hawks and red-headed woodpeckers can be seen year around, as can barred and great horned owls. Several bald eagles were sighted on the lake in 2006. Other birds that can be observed, especially around Pokagon State Park, include brown creepers, veeries, several types of warblers, bluebirds, Carolina wrens, Baltimore orioles, and pileated woodpeckers. =In the lake= alt= Side view of a greenish fish in vegetation with blue finds and a dark blue spot near its gill.Fishing is popular at Lake James during all seasons. According to surveys conducted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources in 1975, 1989, and 2000, the lake has about 20 species of fish. Excluding the small minnow brook silversides, bluegill is the most common species of fish, followed by largemouth bass and rock bass. Yellow bullheads, yellow perch, and redear sunfish can also be found. Northern pike, though not as plentiful as the other species listed above, also live in Lake James. Lake James has over 20 types of aquatic plants. In a survey conducted by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources during 2005, 23 types of submersed plants were found—plus two types of floating plants. The type of plant found is generally dependent upon the water depth. Most plants are found at depths of to . At depths of to , the dominant vegetation is chara, a plant-like type of algae. Beyond depths of but less than , Illinois pondweed, Vallisneria, and Sago pondweed tend to be the dominant plants. Variable watermilfoil are the plants typically found at depths of to . Beyond , chara is usually the only vegetation, and it has been found growing as deep as . Most plants found in the lake are native species that are useful for providing food and habitat for fish and waterfowl. Recreation Pokagon State Park's Beach house on the Third Basin of Lake James In addition to being the home of Pokagon State Park and the Lake James Christian Assembly, Lake James is known for boating and fishing. A sandbar in the First Basin, not far from the Potawatomi Inn, has been a popular boat gathering place. In a survey conducted in 2005, over 60 percent of the lake's residents who participated in the survey listed fishing, fast boating, and water skiing as their preferred activities. Boating has become so popular that some residents have become concerned about overcrowding during the summer weekends. During August 2005 the number of boats docked on the lake totaled about 2,000. Ski boats, cabin cruisers, deck boats, and fishing boats accounted for 36 percent of the total. Pontoon boats accounted for 22 percent of the total, and personal water crafts were another 17 percent. The remaining watercraft were sailboats, canoes, kayaks, row boats and any boats that did not fit in a category. Nearly all of the lake's shoreline, with the exception of Pokagon State Park, has been developed. Many residents have owned property on the lake for over 20 years. Lakefront properties are available for purchase, with a wide variety of styles and prices—including homes valued above $1 million. Residents and visitors can participate in weekly sailboat races sponsored by the Lake James Yacht Club. The lake is also the site of special events. The 4th of July is celebrated with a boat parade followed by fireworks. Each September, the Seaplane Pilots Association sponsors a Seaplane Splash-In in the lower basin not far from the Potawatomi Inn.

It was the worst accident on the subway system since the 1928 Times Square derailment. The motorman was found at fault for intoxication and excessive speed, and served time in prison for manslaughter. Before the accident The motorman assigned to operate the train, 38-year old Robert E. Ray, reported to the Woodlawn terminal on the 4 route to begin his eight-hour shift at 11:30 p.m. on August 27, 1991, fifteen minutes late. Despite visible signs that should have had Ray disqualified for duty that night, including bloodshot eyes and wearing tennis shoes, the dispatcher at the Woodlawn terminal that night, Percival Hossack, allowed Ray to go on-duty and assigned him a portable radio for use. Ray then took control of a ten-car R62 train, along with conductor David Beerram, departing Woodlawn at 11:38 p.m., six minutes late. Among the passengers on board was another conductor, Steve Darden, who had just finished his shift and was riding the train back home. Almost immediately, Ray overran the first stop, Mosholu Parkway, by five cars. Then Ray overran the next stop, Bedford Park Boulevard-Lehman College, by one car. In both instances, Beerram admonished Ray, but did not pull the emergency brake, which would have required a complex restarting procedure and made Ray's condition apparent, or radio the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA)'s command center about Ray's operation or request that power be cut to the train, as required by NYCTA regulations. As Ray's operation of the train became more erratic continuing down the line, both Beerram and the off-duty Darden warned him multiple times about his operation, but no one on board pulled the emergency brake to stop the train. Accident During the night of August 27–28, 1991, there was construction on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line that required southbound express trains to switch to the local track. This required the trains to slow down to before entering a diamond crossover to access a \\"pocket track\\" between the southbound local and express tracks. The pocket track had been part of the original design of the line, and was intended so that trains switching between tracks would not delay local and express trains that were not going through the switch. At about 12:12 a.m. on August 28, 1991, 44 minutes after leaving Woodlawn, Ray's erratic operation of the train finally led to disaster, as the train heading southbound with approximately 216 passengers, going at nearly , too fast for a tripcock to stop the train in time, derailed at the pocket track north of the 14th Street–Union Square station.\\"Case Study Number Ten: Union Square Station, New York City—August 28, 1991\\", in: John Kimball and Hollis Stambaugh, Special Report: Rail Emergencies, Technical report series (United States Fire Administration) USFA-TR-094, [Emmitsburg, Maryland]: Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Fire Administration, National Fire Data Center, [2003?], p. 27.\\"Probe Finds Subway's Speed Outstripped Safety System\\", The Washington Post, August 31, 1991 Five passengers died, mostly in the second car, almost immediately, and 161 passengers were seriously injured.

The second, #1439, was folded in half by the barrier between the express and local tracks. Car #1437 was split in half and folded around a support beam, and cars #1436 and #1435 were also seriously damaged. The cars lay tangled between the support beams. The train was damaged so badly that one emergency responder said that he \\"couldn't even tell where one car ended and another began at some points\\".

The accident location was very close to the platform, which was used for triage, and field treatment took place at street level. Working conditions at the site were very cramped and hot, and it took until approximately 3:30 a.m. until Darden, the off-duty conductor on board, was the last injured passenger extracted from the train. In total, 121 passengers and 24 emergency responders (who suffered heat- related conditions or minor cuts and bruises) were taken to hospitals; sixteen passengers were injured seriously enough to be admitted. Debris was found as far away as from the lead car. Ray later said that he had drunk heavily the day before his work shift because he was depressed that his ex-girlfriend would not let him see their two children, and that at the time of the accident he had fallen asleep.\\"Nation & World: Newsmaker\\", The Milwaukee Journal, September 1, 1991, p. J1. Ray was not hurt in the crash, so he walked into the station and identified himself, then sat on a park bench during the rescue operation. The NYPD later reported that he drank three beers after the accident.Associated Press, \\"N.Y. police say subway motorman was drunk; manslaughter charged\\", The Greenfield Recorder, August 29, 1991, via Fultonhistory.com. Ray was arrested at 5:30 a.m. while returning to his apartment building, and when tested approximately thirteen hours after the accident, his blood alcohol level was 0.21; the legal level in New York State was 0.10 at the time. The facts that Ray had overshot the first two stops in the Bronx and had been warned repeatedly by Beerram and Darden to reduce his speed, and had not braked approaching 14th Street–Union Square, were brought up in the ensuing trial. On October 15, 1992, a jury acquitted Ray of murder but found him guilty of five counts of second-degree manslaughter,\\"Subway motorman found guilty of manslaughter\\", Sarasota Herald-Tribune, October 16, 1992, p. 14A.Laurie Goodstein, \\"New York Motorman Convicted of Manslaughter; Subway Employee Cleared of Murder Charges in Train Wreck That Killed Five Last Year\\", The Washington Post, October 16, 1992 and on November 6 he was sentenced to five to fifteen years in prison plus terms of between one and seven years for assault on 26 of the injured passengers, all to run concurrently.Ronald Sullivan, \\"Motorman Gets 5 to 15 Years in Crash\\", The New York Times, November 7, 1992.

Aftermath The day after the crash, the MTA announced that it would start randomly checking subway motormen and bus drivers for illegal substances, such as drugs or alcohol. Using figures from another fatal incident the previous year, the MTA estimated that it would have to pay between $5 million and $10 million to accident victims. Service on the Lexington Avenue Line resumed six days after the accident, on September 3, after completion of the site investigation and four days of round-the-clock debris removal and construction work, including the Labor Day holiday.Calvin Sims, \\"Subway Line Back After Being Closed By Fatal Derailing\\", The New York Times, September 3, 1991.\\"Topics of The Times; After Tragedy, Teamwork\\", Opinion, The New York Times, September 6, 1991. The five R62 subway cars destroyed in the accident—the lead car, #1440, and four of the five following cars, #1435, #1436, #1437, and #1439—were scrapped.\\"R-62 (Kawasaki) — R-62A (Bombardier)\\", nycsubway.org, retrieved May 27, 2014.Car #1438 was not seriously damaged, so it was later returned to service along with #1431–1434, the other four cars in the train. Car #1438 was converted from a non-driving car, or \\"B\\" car, to a cab car, or \\"A\\" car, in the process. At the time, all R62s were linked in five-car sets, but originally, each car could operate as a single unit. In addition to the support columns, two sets of track, a third rail, two signal sets, two switches, and an air compressor room had been destroyed. The switches and tracks were rebuilt, with the NYCTA removing the \\"pocket track\\" on which the train had derailed and replacing it with a simple diamond crossover. In addition, the NYCTA added diverging grade time signals to force trains to slow down earlier before crossing between tracks. Reporters at New York Newsday won the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Reporting for their coverage of the accident.\\"1992 Winners and Finalists\\", The Pulitzer Prizes.\\"1992 Pulitzer Prize Winners and Their Works in Journalism and the Arts\\", The New York Times, April 8, 1992. A 1992 study commissioned after the accident by the NYCTA found that some signals in the subway system, including several on the Lexington Avenue line, were spaced too closely for a train traveling at maximum speed to have time to stop, confirming the finding of safety investigators immediately after the crash; the issue resurfaced after a rear-end collision on the Williamsburg Bridge in 1995.Richard Perez-Pena, \\"'92 Study Found Problems With Subway Stop Signals\\", The New York Times, June 21, 1995.Associated Press, \\"Operators not warned about signal problem\\", The Hour, June 22, 1995, p. 18.

A18. The NTSB recommended that speed indication systems be installed on subway cars. The NYCTA had been testing speed indication systems since 1990. By May 1994, gear unit type speed indication systems were installed on the R44s and R46s, and ring type speed indication systems were purchased for installation on 40% of R62As. In May 1994, a $203,064 bid was awarded for the procurement of 132 Doppler radar type speed indication systems for the R62s, the type of train damaged in the accident..

Rollinson has worked at Callaway since graduating college in 1991, and as head designer for the Odyssey brand since 1997. He has designed custom putters for Phil Mickelson and Ernie Els. After the Professional Golf Association banned anchor putters in 2012, Rollinson led the team at Oddysey that designed an arm lock putter to lock against a golfer's forearm. His name appears on more than 300 patents related to the design of golf equipment. Early life and education Rollinson gained his interest in golf from his father and grandfather. In 1986, Rollinson graduated from Morristown-Beard School in Morristown, New Jersey. During his senior year, his golf team won the New Jersey State Championship. After high school, Rollinson completed his bachelor's degree in physics at the University of Richmond in Richmond, Virginia in 1990. While studying science, he took elective courses in art and music. In 1990, Rollinson sent a letter to Ely Callaway, Jr., the founder of Callaway Golf, expressing an interest in working at the company. The letter led to an interview in which Callaway hired him as a golf club designer. Golf club design In an interview with Links Magazine, Rollinson noted that the rules of golf make it easier to support design innovation for putters than for other golf clubs. He noted, \\"The rules of what you can do in designing a putter are so much more open than with woods and irons. There’s much more freedom in terms of the shape. It’s all over the map.” Rollinson also described in the interview that he designs putters to fit how golfers perceive contrasts. He stated, “The eye uses contrast to pick out edges of objects. ... The eye has a really good ability to pick out lines that are perpendicular and it wants to form a perfect right angle. It’s like when the eye sees a picture that’s crooked.” Thus, Rollinson designed lateral contrasts in putters to match this perceptive process. Rollnson has a talent for rapidly designing putters for players on the PGA Tour, including when they face trouble with using one during a tournament. He noted in a profile on golf.com, \\"I always love the Friday afternoon fire drill.\\" When Phil Mickelson showed an interest to try out the Sabertooth belly putter used by Keegan Bradley, Rollinson made him a new putter over a weekend. Family Rollinson lives in Solana Beach, California with his wife Sally. They have three children.

He reached the high rank of megas konostaulos.  Life  Michael and his brother, George Atouemes Monomachos, were scions of the Monomachos family, an aristocratic lineage that stretched back to the 10th century. Their exact relation to other early 14th- century members of the family is unknown, and they are among the last attested members of the family in Byzantine times. Michael is mentioned for the first time in 1315, when he served as governor (kephale) of Thessalonica. He continued in the same office in 1321, when he is recorded as tatas tes aules, and in 1327, when he was eparchos. In the civil war of 1321–28, he supported Andronikos II Palaiologos against his grandson, Andronikos III. Monomachos remained in Thessalonica until 1332/3. In that year, Stephen Gabrielopoulos, the semi-independent ruler of western Thessaly and parts of southwestern Macedonia, died. Gabrielopoulos had been a Byzantine vassal, but the neighbouring ruler of Epirus, John II Orsini, quickly moved to take over his territories. In response, Andronikos III ordered Monomachos in Thessalonica to intervene, before coming himself to Thessaly at the head of an army. The Byzantines soon regained control of most of the region, although the historian Božidar Ferjančić doubts Kantakouzenos' assertion that the Epirote forces were completely expelled and all of Thessaly recaptured at that time, pointing out the lack of imperial charters in western Thessaly before 1336, and insists that the imperial forces captured only the eastern portions of the region in 1332/3. Andronikos III, after spending the winter in the area, left Monomachos as the governor of the new province, with the title of protosebastos. At the latest by the time of John II Orsini's death in 1335, Monomachos and Andronikos III were able to extend Byzantine control over western Thessaly as well, and even to advance into Epirus proper and capture Ioannina. In 1338, Andronikos III completed his invasion of the Epirote heartland by capturing the Epirote capital, Arta, and annexing Epirus to the Empire. This move was opposed by the local population, who in the next year rebelled against Palaiologan rule. The Epirotes rallied around their young ruler, Nikephoros II Orsini, who escaped Byzantine custody and returned to Epirus with troops from the Angevin court of Naples. The rebels captured Arta and took the Byzantine governor, Theodore Synadenos, prisoner. Consequently, in late 1339 or early 1340, a Byzantine army under Monomachos and John Angelos advanced against the rebels, followed soon by the emperor himself. By the end of the year, the various rebel-held strongholds capitulated. Nikephoros was accorded the title of panhypersebastos and sent to Thessalonica, where his mother and sister already lived, and Epirus returned to Byzantine control with John Angelos as governor. With the outbreak of the new civil war between John Kantakouzenos and the regency for John V Palaiologos in 1341, Monomachos initially tried to remain neutral, leading the regents to confiscate his estates at the village of Chantax near Strymon River. In 1342, he left or was driven from Thessaly by the pro-Kantakouzenos faction, and went to Serres, where he joined the anti- Kantakouzenist forces holding the city. He was named megas konostaulos at about that time, and died sometime between 1343 and 1346.

However, the area of the prefecture jurisdiction was different. The term Shuntian fu also referred to the yamen (office) of the prefecture's local government.  Evolution  During the Yuan dynasty, the imperial capital circuit known as Dadu circuit (大都路; Dadulu) was under control of the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng). During the eighth month of the first year of reign of the Hongwu Emperor of the new Ming dynasty, this was renamed to Beiping prefecture, and in the tenth month it was attached to Shandong province. In the first lunar month in the first year of the reign of the Yongle Emperor, the capital was renamed Beijing and the prefecture as Shuntian. Shuntian prefecture went through many changes during the Qing dynasty, and it was only in 1743 during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor that its borders and administrative divisions were settled. Then, Shuntian prefecture was divided into four sub-divisions (路廳, luting) and twenty four sub-prefectures (州, zhou) counties (縣, xian). It was also placed under an imperial magistrate (府尹, fuyin). In 1910 with the demise of the Qing dynasty, Shuntian prefecture was slowly abolished on 4 October 1914 which became Capital Area (京兆地方; Jīngzhào Dìfāng) later became Beiping Special City on 20 June 1928. The remains of the Shuntian yamen can be found in today's Dongcheng District in Beijing at Donggong street (東公街).  Jurisdiction  During the Ming era, Shuntian had 5 sub-prefectures (州) and 22 counties (縣). In 1490, Shuntian had 100,518 households and a population of 669,033. In 1578, Shuntian had 101,134 households and a population of 706,861. After 1743, Shuntian prefecture was divided into four sub-divisions. * The west subdivision (西路廳, Xi Luting) had its seat near the Lugou bridge (盧溝橋), and it ruled Zhuozhou sub-prefectures (涿州), Daxing (大興), Wanping (宛平), Liangxiang (良鄉), and Fangshan (房山) counties. * The east subdivision (東路廳, \\"Dong Luting\\") had its seat at Zhangjiawan (張家灣), and it ruled over Tongzhou (通州) and Jizhou (薊州) sub- prefectures, and Sanhe (三河), Wuqing (武清), Baodi (寶坻), Ninghe (寧河)、and Xianghe (香河) counties. * The south subdivision (南路廳, Nan Luting) had its seat at Huangcun (黃村), and it ruled over Bazhou sub-prefecture (霸州), Baoding (保定), Wenan (文安), Dacheng (大城), Gu-an (固安), Yongqing (永清), and Dong-an (東安). * The north subdivision (北路廳, Bei Luting) had its seat at Gonghua city (鞏華城) in Shahe suburb (沙河鎮), and it ruled over Changpingzhou sub-prefecture (昌平州), and Shunyi (順義), Huairou (懷柔), Miyun (密雲), and Pinggu (平谷) counties.  Administrative Level  As Shuntian was the administrative district containing the capital Beijing, the Shuntian prefecture magistrate (府尹, fuyin) was particularly renowned. This magistrate was an Qing official of the third rank (正三品, zhengsanpin), which was two to three ranks higher than magistrates of other prefectures. In fact, some of the Shuntian magistrates were shilang (侍郎) rank imperial ministers. While the yamen of third-rank Qing officials used copper seals, the yamen of Shuntian prefecture used silver seals. Even though the sub-prefectures and counties of Shuntian formally belonged to the Zhili viceroyalty, the Shuntian magistrate did not have a subordinate relationship with the Viceroy of Zhili. The areas of the Shuntian prefecture outside the Beijing city wall were under the dual administration of the Zhili viceroy and Shuntian magistrate yamens. In contrast, the Zhili viceroy had no authority within the Beijing city wall.  Administration of Beijing  During the early Qing dynasty, an interesting facet of Beijing city administration was that Han and Manchu had separate residence and administration. The Manchu Bannermen all lived in the Three-Battalions Barracks (三大營, sandaying) or so-called inner city located in Xijiao (西郊). The Han Chinese and other ethnic groups lived in the outer city. As the outer city consisted of five towns and ten lanes (五城十坊, wuchengshifang), it gave rise to an old Chinese saying \\"inside eight banners, outside five towns\\" (內八旗外五城, neibaqiwaiwucheng). While Shuntian magistrate had jurisdiction over the Han and other ethnic population in the outer city, the jurisdiction of the Bannermen fell under the military office of the Nine Gates Infantry Commander (九門提督, jiumen tidu).

The ceremony was noted by media for being the first ever swearing-in of an Indian Prime Minister to have been attended by the heads of all SAARC countries. Background Post the declaration of election results on 16 May 2014, Modi met the President of India Pranab Mukherjee on 20 May where Mukherjee invited Modi to form the next government. The BJP had won 282 seats and their alliance National Democratic Alliance won a total of 336 seats in the 543-seat Lok Sabha, the strongest mandate since the 1984 elections where Indian National Congress had won. The BJP then announced that Modi would be sworn in on 26 May 2014 at 6 p.m. Modi's actual oath was made at 6:13 p.m. IST. Ceremony The swearing-in ceremony was held at the forecourts of the Rashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi which has been used as the venue of swearing-in by only two previous Prime Ministers, Chandra Shekhar (1990, Samajwadi Janata Party) and Atal Bihari Vajpayee (1996 and 1998, BJP). The Durbar Hall was another possible venue but was rejected for its small sitting capacity of 500. BJP indicated that the ceremony would be held in open ground. Before, Modi has taken his oath as Chief Minister of Gujarat in open stadiums. Extra trains were scheduled from Varanasi and Gujarat on the previous day for viewers to reach Delhi. The special “K9” squad of trained dogs belonging to the Indo- Tibetan Border Police was employed to secure the areas of the venue. The squad has previously been used at the time of 2010 Commonwealth Games and other Naxal-affected regions. India's national broadcaster Doordarshan had various innovative ways planned. The ceremony’s broadcast had an anchor in inset narrating the event in sign-language. This had previously been used in the Republic Day parade broadcast, but was the first time for a swearing-in. In another first, the 15 regional television channels of Doordarshan aired the ceremony in the respective regional languages. The event was also the first of its kind to ever be streamed live on YouTube. \\\\- The ceremony cost the President's Estate ₹34 lakh.  Invitees  The guest-list includes various heads of the states, political parties and groups along with leaders of SAARC countries. The event is hence viewed as a \\"major diplomatic event\\". \\\\- =International dignitaries= All SAARC heads of government attended. The ceremony was the first swearing-in of an Indian Prime Minister where all SAARC heads were invited. After the ceremony, Modi described this new government's first major initiative in foreign policy as the \\"right decision at the right time\\". (L-R) President Pranab Mukherjee, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif and Prime Minister of Mauritius, Navin Ramgoolam. * – President Hamid Karzai accepted the invitation to attend the ceremony. He is bound to leave the office post the ongoing presidential elections. But his acceptance was seen as Afghanistan’s interest in working with India in future. Media also noted that his either successors Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani are pro-India. * - Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury, the speaker of Jatiyo Sangshad, (the House of the Nation) accepted the invitation on behalf of the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina as Hasina had a pre-planned visit to Japan. * - Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay attended the ceremony and planned to have a discussion on bilateral relations of the two countries on 27 May. * - Maldivian President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom attended the ceremony. \\\\- * - Mauritius Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam attended the ceremony. * - Nepal Prime Minister Sushil Koirala accepted the invitation. * - Indian politicians reacted strongly after Nawaz Sharif accepted the invitation to the swearing-in ceremony on May 24. National Conference's (NC) Omar Abdullah was glad that the Pakistan PM had accepted the invitation to Modi's swearing-in. He said that this would mark a new beginning in Indo-Pakistani ties. Key National Democratic Alliance (NDA) ally Shiv Sena, which has been vocal against Pakistan for sponsoring terrorism in India, came out opposing the invitation to the Pakistan Prime Minister. Pakistani journalists and politicians however had mixed views on Sharif accepting the invitation. * - President Mahinda Rajapaksa's invitation and attendance to the ceremony came under heavy criticism amongst Tamil Nadu politicians. The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and NDA ally Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) leaders had spoken against the Modi government's decision to invite the Sri Lankan president. \\\\- MDMK chief Vaiko met Modi to try to change his mind about the invitation while the Congress leaders were one with the MDMK and the AIADMK opposing the invitation. Amid strong opposition from all quarters, CPI(M) on Sunday said the Centre should utilise this occasion for resolving the Lankan Tamils issue. A Tamil students group called Delhi Tamil Youth Forum staged a protest in the streets of Delhi on Sunday to register their anger. Due to Modi's goodwill and peaceful approach, Indian fishermen were released by Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Pakistan released 151 fishermen on 25 May from the Malir jail in Karachi and Nara jail in Hyderabad in Sindh province. Modi welcomed this move of both the nations. The prime minister of the Tibetan Government-in-Exile, Lobsang Sangay, attended the ceremony. The Chinese government opposed the invitation to the Tibetan leader. =National dignitaries= Outgoing Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, former Presidents A. P. J.

The type species is Nanobamus macrorhinus. The type specimen is UCLAVP 3686, a skull recovered from the Lower Permian Arroyo Formation (Texas, United States).  History of study  UCLA VP 3686 was originally described by Olson (1985) as a larval \\"trematopsid\\" (now called 'trematopids'). Much of this referral was based on the elongate external naris, a feature that is well known in derived trematopids such as Acheloma, although the feature is not exclusive to trematopids or universally found in all trematopids. This identification was challenged by Dilkes (1991), who noted that the construction of the naris was different from that of trematopids, implying convergence on this feature. Dilkes argued that while the specimen was clearly a dissorophoid, it could not be referred to a particular dissorophoid family. Schoch (2002) briefly noted that the specimen was \\"clearly an amphibamid ['amphibamiform' in the current framework].\\" The specimen was formally recognized as the type specimen of a new amphibamiform genus and species, Nanobamus macrorhinus, by Schoch & Milner (2014).  Anatomy  Schoch & Milner (2014) list six characters in their diagnosis of N. macrorhinus: (1) naris extending posterior to the septomaxilla, with the shape of a sideways '8'; (2) narrow interorbital distance; (3) large postfrontal; (4) frontal twice as wide anteriorly as it is posteriorly; (5) large denticle field extending onto the base of the cultriform process; (6) slender basipterygoid process of the pterygoid extending onto the basal plate of the parasphenoid.

From January 2014 until March 2015 she was the Czech Minister of Justice in the government of Bohuslav Sobotka. She was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for ANO 2011, though she is now non-partisan. On 10 February 2015, Andrej Babiš, the leader of ANO 2011, announced that Válková will be replaced in the function by the lawyer Robert Pelikán. Válková's tenure ended on 1 March.  Life and career  Válková attended the Faculty of Law at Charles University in Prague, where she received her Candidate of Sciences in the field of criminal law. Between 1975 and 1988 she worked as a scientist at the Criminological Research Institute, and then until 1993 at the Institute of State and Law of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences. She also taught from 1991 at the Charles University Faculty of Philosophy, where she laid the foundations for her social work in criminal justice, and from 1993 in the Faculty of Law at the University of West Bohemia in Plzen, where she became Head of the Criminal Law Department in 1998. She was temporarily suspended from this office in 2009 following her criticism of the faculty management. Further disagreements finally led her to leave the faculty in 2011. She gained a doctorate in Criminal Law in 2006 from the University of Trnava. She is also a member of the Department of Public Law and Public Justice at the CEVRO Institute in Prague. In 1993 she founded the Czech branch of C. H. Beck, where she became director of publishing. She later became chief editor of the publishing schedule and of specialist magazines. She organised and took part in an international conference on criminal law and criminology, and took part in several study trips to the Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Criminal Law in Freiburg. She was involved in writing the Juvenile Justice Law (č. 218/2003 Sb.). Helena Válková is married with one son.  Political career  Until 1989, Válková had been a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. After November 1989 she became involved with Civic Forum. In the 2013 Czech legislative election, she stood successfully for parliament for the ANO 2011 movement of Andrej Babiš, as their number two candidate for the Prague regional list. From 5 December 2013, she held the position of vice-chair of the Parliamentary Committee for Constitutional Affairs. In January 2014 Válková was put forward as the ANO 2011 candidate for Minister of Justice in the government of Bohuslav Sobotka. She was appointed to this position on 29 January 2014. The following summer she filed an application to join the ANO movement and became a member in early 2015. In March 2014, in an interview with the website Echo24, she was asked for her opinion on the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia following World War II, and replied, \\"The worst. I understand that it was a reaction to what had happened to the Czechs before then, but there wasn't all that much going on in the Protectorate.\\" This comment caused great controversy, and Válková later apologised. At the end of May 2014, Válková became involved in a dispute with her deputy minister Hana Marvanová, caused by disagreements over reductions in lawyers' fees and the appointment of some judicial officials. Marvanová subsequently resigned. Two weeks later she entered another dispute with another deputy, Pavel Štern, over the tendering process for electronic tags for domestic prisoners. Štern refused to provide her with detailed information about the tendering process, to which he claimed she was not entitled. He subsequently consulted the anti-corruption police. Válková cancelled the tender due to doubts about transparency and removed Štern from his post. The personnel changes at the Ministry of Justice provoked a wave of anger in political circles and Prime Minister Sobotka announced, that \\"Should (Válková) show any further hesitation in the management of her office, it will be ČSSD as a coalition party requiring a change in the whole Ministry of Justice.\\" In February 2015 she announced her resignation from the post of Czech Minister for Justice, effective 1 March 2015. Responding to some articles commenting on her failure in managing the ministry, Válková said \\"I have begun to feel disgusted with the situation developing around me.\\" She was replaced by Robert Pelikán. = Nomination for the Public Defender office = In December 2019, Czech President Miloš Zeman nominated her for the office of Ombudsman. In January 2020 the news website Info.cz republished and discussed an article from 1979 authored by Válková together with the communist prosecutor Josef Urválek, accusing her of defending laws used against dissidents during the normalisation era. The controversy resulted in the withdrawal of her nomination by the president.

It was released in 1993 on Seed Records, an alternative-oriented subsidiary of Big Beat Records, and was produced by Kevin Salem. In the United Kingdom, the album was released by Revolver Distribution, and its song \\"Swim\\" was released as an import single there. \\"Swim\\" increased the band's popularity in the UK thanks to the single's promotion by John Peel of the BBC. As of March 5, 1994, the album had sold 10,000 copies in the UK. Reception Bring it Down received mainly positive reviews upon its release, and prompted many British critics to proclaim Madder Rose as the second coming of the Velvet Underground. The album's title track was named the 27th best song of 1993 by NME. It has been described, retrospectively, as \\"an amalgam of driving beats, searing guitars, and sweet vocals.\\" Another favorable retrospective assessment came from Everett True, who wrote in 2009 that the album was \\"pretty gorgeous\\". In addition, in a favorable review, Rachel Felder compared Madder Rose's guitar sound to that of Dinosaur Jr. and My Bloody Valentine. However, some critics, such as Peter Margasak, criticized the album for sounding too much like typical indie rock.

Most of the adherents of the religion accepted Islam after the 18th century Jihad by the Islamic reformer Usman dan Fodio. Terminology Bòòríí is a Hausa noun, meaning the spiritual force that resides in physical things, and is related to the word for local distilled alcohol (borassa) as well the practice of medicine (boka).H. R. Palmer. \\"'Bori' Among the Hausas\\". Man, Vol. 14, 1914 (1914), pp. 113–117. The Bori religion is both an institution to control these forces, and the performance of an \\"adorcism\\" (as opposed to exorcism) ritual, dance and music by which these spirits are controlled and by which illness is healed.Lewis, Al-Safi, Hurreiz (1991). Pre-Islamic Hausaland An aspect of the traditional Maguzawa Hausa religious traditions, Bori became a state religion led by ruling-class priestesses among some of the late pre-colonial Hausa states. When Islam started making inroads into Hausa land in the 14th century, certain aspects of the religion such as idol worship were driven underground. The cult of Tsumbubura in the then Sultanate of Kano and many other similar Bori cults were suppressed, but Bori survived in \\"spirit-possession\\" cults by integrating some aspects of Islam. The Bori spirit possession priestesses maintained nominal influence over the Sultanates that replaced the earlier Animist kingdoms. Priestesses communed with spirits through ecstatic dance ritual, hoping to guide and maintain the state's ruling houses. A corps of Bori priestesses and their helpers was led by royal priestess, titled the \\"Inna\\", or \\"Mother of us all\\".Variations included Iya, Magaram, and Magajiya. See Bergstrom (2002). The Inna oversaw this network, which was not only responsible for protecting society from malevolent forces through possession dances, but which provided healing and divination throughout the kingdom. Post-Islamic and contemporary practice Muslim scholars of the early 19th century disapproved of the hybrid religion practised in royal courts, overzealous Muslims were to use this hybridization as an excuse to overthrow the Sultanates and form the Sokoto Caliphate.Robinson, David, Muslim Societies in African History (Cambridge, 2004), p. 141. With the birth of the Caliphate, Bori practices were partially suppressed in Fula courts. Bori possession rituals survived in the Hausa refugee states such as Konni and Dogondutchi (in what is today southern Niger) and in some rural areas of Nigerian Hausaland. The powerful advisory roles of women, exemplified in the Bori priestesses, either disappeared or were transferred to Muslim women in scholarly, educational, and community leadership roles. British and French colonialism, though, offered little space for women in the official hierarchies of indirect rule, and the formal roles, like the Bori, for women in governance largely disappeared by the mid 20th century.See Bergstrom (2002)'s discussion of this, particularly under the Zinder caliphate in Niger. In modern Muslim Hausaland, Bori ritual survives in some places assimilated into syncretic practices. The pre-Muslim \\"babbaku\\" spirits of the Maguzaci have been added to over time with \\"Muslim\\" spirits (\\"farfaru\\"), and spirits of (or representing) other ethnic groups, even those of the European colonialists. The healing and \\"luck\\" aspects of Bori members performances, almost entirely women, give new social roles for their rituals and practitioners.Umar Habila Dadem Danfulani. Factors Contributing to the Survival of the Bori Cult in Northern Nigeria. Bori ritual societies, separated from governing structures, provide a powerful corporate identity for the women who belong to them through the practice of traditional healing, as well as through the performance of Bori festival like the girka initiation ritual.Masquelier, Review (1992). In spirit possession all over Africa the gender of the possessing spirit takes precedence over the gender of the possessed. A man possessed by a female spirit for ritual purposes takes the personality of a woman, while a woman possessed by a male spirit takes the personality of a man. This often has no relevance to everyday living. Bori possession cults exist in countries all over Africa under different names. However it is only found in some ethnic groups and is totally absent in most. References Further reading *Adeline Masquelier.

In April 1404, Stephen's elder brother Centurione II Zaccaria succeeded in replacing his aunt, Maria II Zaccaria, as ruler of the Principality of Achaea. Despite their kinship, Centurione and Stephen were not always aligned: in 1406–07, Stephen allied himself with Carlo I Tocco and the Byzantine Despot of the Morea, Theodore I Palaiologos, in the latter's unsuccessful attempts to overthrow Centurione and capture his domains. In 1408 Stephen, threatened by mounting Ottoman raids in the Peloponnese and faced with financial difficulties, decided to lease the administration of Patras to the Republic of Venice for five years, in exchange for an annual fee of 1,000 ducats. This move suited the strategic interests of the Republic, as together with Lepanto, Patras gave it control of the entrance to the Corinthian Gulf. In 1418, threatened by the advances of the Byzantines in Messenia, Stephen once again turned to Venice for protection, calling on Venice to send troops from Negroponte to garrison Patras. The Republic accepted, but the Venetian troops had to withdraw in 1419 due to the opposition of the Pope, who was concerned lest Patras, a possession of the Church, fall permanently under Venetian control. Faced with renewed offensives by the Byzantines, in early 1422, both Centurione and Stephen contacted the Knights Hospitaller, offering to surrender their domains to them, but the Hospitallers refused to become involved, citing their commitments against the Ottomans in the southeastern Aegean. Venice then tried to intervene and buy the entire Peloponnese from the various local rulers, or at least organize an effective league against the Ottoman threat, but the negotiations in 1422–23 failed to achieve any result. On 8 January 1424, on his deathbed, Stephen placed Patras under the protection of Venice, but the Pope, who continued to oppose the growing Venetian influence in the area, named Pandolfo Malatesta as Stephen's successor instead of a Venetian cleric. Five years later, Patras would fall to the Despot of the Morea, Constantine Palaiologos.

Agustín Cruz Tinoco is an artisan from San Agustín de las Juntas, Oaxaca, Mexico noted for his wood carvings. His work has been recognized both in Mexico and abroad. Origin Ferris wheel by the artisan Cruz Tinoco learned to carve as a child from his father, also a noted artisan, in his hometown of San Juan Otzolotepec in the Sierra Mixe region of Oaxaca, where his family grew coffee and corn. When he was older, he moved to San Agustín de las Juntas, a town near the Oaxacan state capital, and sent for his wife, Cleotilde Prudencio Martínez, and four children a year later. Initially he worked in construction to support his family, carving at night, finding more of a market for his works there than he had in his hometown, despite the fact that San Agustín de las Juntas is not a town noted for wood crafts. Artistry Angel and the Archangel Michael by the artisan Cruz Tinoco is best known for his religious figures and nativity scenes, but also creates various other figures such as carts, carousels, Ferris wheels, and altarpieces. He has also made whimsical works such as nativity scenes mounted on a tortoise, boxes in a jaguar shape, skeletal figures and animals doing human activities and even a chess set pitting the Spanish conquistadors against the Mexican indigenous people. He works in pine, cedar, Mahogany and a soft local wood called copal, popular among Oaxacan craftsmen. He studies the raw wood in order to use its natural forms and qualities in the finished piece. His tools include machetes, various knives, chisels, agave thorns and needles. The machetes and large knives are for creating the basic shape of a piece, with the smaller implements to refine and create intricate details and designs. Involvement of the family Originally Cruz Tinoco left the works unpainted until his older daughter Edilma became interested in painting them. This made the works more popular and soon the rest of the family were participating in the carving and painting, which is traditional among Oaxacan artisan families. His two sons help with the carving, with the younger, Manuel, being the more promising carver, and the older, Agustín, Jr., doing much of the public relations work. His wife and two daughters do the painting, often with direction from Cruz Tinoco, using acrylics. First a base coat is applied, and other colors are applied over that, often with intricate and repeating designs. Recognition Cruz Tinoco and the family have won awards and recognition for their work in Mexico and abroad. They participate regularly in the International Folk Art Market in Santa Fe, New Mexico and are featured in the book Grandes Maestros de Arte Popular de Iberoamerica, published in 2014 by Banamex.

He has been a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin West constituency since 2020. He previously served as Chairman of the Green Party from 2011 to 2019. Early and personal life O'Gorman is originally from Mulhuddart, and now lives in Blanchardstown. Before becoming a TD, he worked as a law lecturer in the School of Law and Government at Dublin City University, where he was the programme chair of the Bachelor of Arts in Economics, Politics and Law programme. As of the 3rd of October 2020, he is marked as \\"on leave\\" on the Dublin City university website. Before this he worked at Griffith College, where he lectured and was a course director for five years. He had completed his undergraduate law degree at Trinity College, followed by a Master of Laws in EU law in the London School of Economics. He completed his PhD entitled 'Union citizenship, social rights and the Marshallian approach' in Trinity College, Dublin in 2011. He is openly gay. Political career O'Gorman first brush with politics and the Green Party came when, at the age of 10 years old, he canvassed on behalf of his local Councillor Trevor Sargent in his successful bid in the 1992 general election. O'Gorman formally joined the Young Greens while studying law at Trinity College Dublin in the early 2000s and supported John Gormley in his bid for the leadership of the Green Party in 2002. O'Gorman was considered of the most ardent supporters of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, which introduced Civil Partnerships for Gay and Lesbian couples in Ireland. O'Gorman was elected as a member of Fingal County Council for the Castleknock local electoral area, following the 2014 local elections. He failed to get elected as a TD at the 2007, 2011 and 2016 general elections, but finally succeeded in being elected following the 2020 general election to represent Dublin West. Pamela Conroy was co-opted to O'Gorman's seat on Fingal County Council following his election to the Dáil. Ministerial career On 27 June 2020, O'Gorman was appointed Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth in the Government of the 33rd Dáil. In July 2020, O'Gorman announced his intention to make it easier for those under the age of 16 to legally change their gender with their parent's consent. That same month he also announced a \\"root and branch\\" review of the \\"fragmented\\" child care sector, with the intention that after 10 months a new agency would be created that could pull together and co-ordinate the many different committees and national bodies already tasked with oversight of Irish childcare as well as cutting through red tape. He also pledged to increase financial support for parents who choose to look after their children themselves rather than using childcare services. Peter Tatchell controversy and harassment by far-right activists Following his appointment as Minister for Children, O'Gorman was criticised on social media for a photo at the Dublin Pride Festival in 2018 in which he appeared alongside Green activists including Peter Tatchell, a Green Party of England and Wales member and LGBT activist who had been criticised for remarks made regarding paedophilia in 1997. Among those to ask for clarity were Newstalk presenter and former medical doctor Ciara Kelly, and actor John Connors. O'Gorman issued a public statement via Twitter regarding the matter. In the same statement, O'Gorman claimed that the episode was \\"rooted in homophobia\\" and was being driven by \\"anonymous far-right Twitter accounts\\". Furthermore, O'Gorman stated that neither he, his party nor the government have any plans to lower the age of consent in Ireland. John Connors subsequently publicly apologised to O'Gorman after Connors appeared at a rally held against O'Gorman outside Dáil Éireann by members of the Irish far-right such as the National Party, who unfurled a banner at the demonstration containing a noose. Connors said after attending the rally he realised he had been \\"politically naive\\" and that he had allowed himself \\"to be lead and be part of an online frenzy that cast hurtful and false assertions\\" on O'Gorman. O'Gorman stated that he accepted the apology and considered the matter \\"fully resolved\\" between the two.

The paper was founded in 1900 and stopped being published in 1992. In the 1950s-1980s the paper was known for its investigative reporting about the Sicilian Mafia. Foundation The paper was founded on the initiative of the entrepreneurial Florio family from Palermo with interests in shipping, shipbuilding, trade and wine industry, fisheries, mining, metallurgy and ceramics. L'Ora: la sua storia, Agave (Contributo allo studio delle fonti della storia dell'arte in Italia nel Novecento - Università degli Studi di Palermo) The first issue was published on April 22, 1900. The formal owner was Carlo Di Rudinì, the son of the former prime minister of Italy Antonio Di Rudinì, but the main shareholder and financier was Ignazio Florio Jr.. The first editor of the paper until 1902 was Vincenzo Morello, one of the most respected Italian political journalists of the time. L'Ora, il primo giornale che ha parlato di mafia, Rai Storia, April 2, 2014 Before directing L'Ora, Morello had worked for La Tribuna, at that time the most widespread newspaper in the center-south of Italy. Other collaborators were Napoleone Colajanni, Francesco Saverio Nitti and Luigi Capuana. The political direction of the newspaper was generally republican and progressive, representing the Sicilian entrepreneurial middle class. After the First World War the editorial line turned against the rise of fascism. In November 1926, in the aftermath of the failed attack against Benito Mussolini in Bologna, the paper was suppressed, along with other anti-Fascist newspapers. L'Ora reappeared in January 1927 under the direction of Nicola Pascazio, a man close to the Fascist regime, former editor of the Il Popolo d'Italia (\\"People of Italy\\"), the organ of the National Fascist Party, with the subtitle \\"fascist newspaper of the Mediterranean\\". The Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943 resulted in the suspension of the newspaper, but publishing resumed on April 8, 1946. The paper changed ownership several times. In 1954, the widow of the last owner sold the newspaper to the GATE company, which was owned by the Italian Communist Party (Partito Comunista Italiano – PCI) and directed by Amerigo Terenzi, already in charge of the newspaper Paese Sera. Golden years Front page of L'Ora five days after the disappearance of De Mauro begging for help to locate him Under the new ownership, the newspaper enjoyed its golden years under the editor-in-chief Vittorio Nistico, who directed the paper between 1954-1975. In this period the journal developed into a newspaper that published many investigative reports about the Sicilian Mafia, in an era that the organisation was hardly mentioned. Era L'Ora della mafia in prima pagina, La Stampa, June 18, 2012 In 1958, L'Ora published a series of investigative reports about the rise of Mafia boss Luciano Leggio in Corleone after the killing of the previous boss Michele Navarra in August 1958, by reporters Felice Chilanti, Mario Farinella, Enzo Lucchi, Michele Pantaleone, Castrense Dadò and Enzo Perrone. The retaliation of Leggio was swift: at 4:52 a.m. on October 19, 1958, a bomb of five kilos TNT exploded in front the newspaper office blowing up half the printing press. Two days later the paper appeared again; the front-page headline read: \\"The mafia threatens us, the investigation continues\\" (see Infobox). L’Ora, avvertimento al tritolo, La Sicilia, June 14, 2009 The price of the journal's civic engagement was the killing of three of its journalists. The first was Cosimo Cristina, who was killed on May 5, 1960, investigating the Mafia in the area of Termini Imerese. Next was Mauro De Mauro who disappeared on September 16, 1970, investigating the involvement of the Mafia with the death of Eni president Enrico Mattei. And finally, Giovanni Spampinato, who was killed on October 27, 1972, while looking into the activities of neo-fascism in Sicily and Mafia smuggling activities along the east coast of Sicily. Decline In the 1970s, the newspaper started to have financial problems. As an afternoon paper, it was more vulnerable to the competition of TV news than its main competitor, the Giornale di Sicilia. The paper also lost support of the PCI that decided to concentrate on its main publication L'Unità in combination with the historic compromise, trying to accommodate the Christian Democrats (DC).Schneider & Schneider, Reversible Destiny, p. 62 Although L'Ora changed to publish as a morning newspaper in 1976, the costs that this entailed proved to be excessive and in 1979 the PCI decided the closure of the newspaper. L'Ora, however, \\"refused to die\\": a cooperative of journalists and administrators got the right to use the title and the property, while a cooperative of workers got the use of the equipment under the same conditions. The measures were taken in the hope of acquiring financial and editorial independence. Nevertheless, by 1980 the Giornale di Sicilia managed to take advantage of the papers weakened position and demoralized staff to lure away four of its younger and promising reporters (Roberto Ciuno, Francesco La Licata, Daniele Billiteri and Franco Nicastro) to form a new crime staff, which competed with L'Ora on one of its main news subjects. From the economic point of view the journal was kept alive thanks to the NEM (Nuova Editrice Meridionale), a company formed by the cooperatives in agreement with the Communist Party, which owned the title and the equipment. Despite the fact that the technological upgrading and renovation of the headquarters in Palermo was successful, editorial and managerial problems led to a lack of adequate leadership. Although the paper enjoyed a revival of sales in 1992, this did not prevent the PDS (Partito Democratico della Sinistra - Democratic Party of the Left), the successor of the PCI, to liquidate L'Ora. The last issue was published on May 8, 1992. On 29 September 2019, the street where the editorial staff of the newspaper used to be located was renamed Via \\"Giornale L'Ora\\" on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the death of Vittorio Nisticò, the historical director of the newspaper. A commemorative plaque was inaugurated to honour the three reporters killed by the Mafia: Mauro De Mauro, Cosimo Cristina and Giovanni Spampinato and the Mafia attack that hit the printing house in 1958.

Prior to her Fish and Wildlife Service career, she briefly saw service during World War II as the United States Coast Guard patrol vessel USCGC Bellefonte (WYP-373), in commission from April to August 1944.  Construction and early history  The ship was built in 1926 by Bath Iron Works at Bath, Maine,United States Coast Guard Historian's Office: Bellefonte, 1944, WYP-373 as the 140-foot (42.7-meter) commercial steam trawler SS Harvard. Harvard fished the waters off New England until 1939, when the General Seafoods Corporation sold her to the United States Government for $1.00 (USD). She came under the control of the United States Department of the Interior, which assigned her to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for conversion to and operation as the fisheries research ship Albatross III.NOAA History: Albatross III  United States Coast Guard career  The United States entered World War II on 7 December 1941. By 1942, Albatross IIIs conversion was well underway, but patrol vessels were badly needed to deal with threats from German submarines, and she was transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard that year for conversion to a patrol vessel. The United States Navy, which oversaw her conversion for the Coast Guard, made radical changes to the ship, lengthening her to 179 feet (54.6 meters) overall, removing her trawling equipment, and installing armament and other military equipment. By the time the ship was commissioned into Coast Guard service as the patrol vessel USCGC Bellefonte (WYP-373), the first Coast Guard ship of the name, on 6 April 1944, the submarine threat largely had abated, and Bellefonte, although she had a mariform bow designed for icebreaking, lacked the stability to be used as the Coast Guard had intended. Her brief career as a Coast Guard vessel thus ended on 22 August 1944, when the Coast Guard decommissioned her. The Coast Guard transferred her back to the Fish and Wildlife Service that year.  United States Fish and Wildlife Service career  Returning to the name Albatross III, the ship underwent another lengthy process of conversion to transform her from a patrol vessel into a fisheries research ship as previously intended. After this finally was completed, she was commissioned into service with the Fish and Wildlife Service on 19 March 1948 at the Boston Fish Pier in Boston, Massachusetts. = Fisheries research capabilities = Albatross III resembled a Boston trawler, with her deck fitted out in the standard Boston trawler layout, although she was much longer than most such ships. She had an electric trawl winch with 600 fathoms (3,600 feet; 1,097 meters) of 7/8-inch (2.22-cm) wire on each of its two drums, allowing her to trawl in waters up to 200 fathoms (1,200 feet; 366 meters) deep. She had a fish hold with a capacity of 50,000 pounds (22,680 kg) of fish on ice and two freezers, one of which could freeze fish quickly and maintain a temperature of minus 20 degrees F (minus 28.9 degrees C), while the other held temperatures at about 32 degrees F (0 degrees C). Albatross III had two laboratories on her main deck just aft of the trawl winch. One, her wet laboratory, opened onto both the port and starboard decks through Dutch doors, had in its center a stainless steel sink suitable for handling and examining fish, and had two small sinks in cabinets on its outside bulkheads for chemical and hydrographic work. Her other laboratory, a dry laboratory, was aft of the wet laboratory and doubled as a library; it had a large work table, chairs, a bench, and shelves, and early in her career served as an office for scientists conducting the preliminary study of data collected at sea, although it later was filled with electronic equipment related to underwater television research. The ship had hydrographic booms and winches on her bridge deck on both her port and starboard sides. The booms had mechanical travelers to which lowering blocks were attached which regulated the distance of the lowering wire from the rail. Albatross III had accommodations for 35 personnel. Her standard complement was 21 (later reduced to 18) crew members and six scientists, and she had living quarters for an additional eight personnel, either additional crew members or additional scientists, as required on a particular voyage. = Service history = Albatros III tied up.Albatross IIIs career focused on the fisheries and oceanography of the northwest Atlantic Ocean. Her first scientific cruise began on 17 May 1948, and she operated fairly consistently until September 1949 on survey work on the New England Banks, in experiments with the selectivity of various sizes of mesh in otter trawls to determine what sizes worked best to allow undersized fish to escape, and in hydrographic work on plankton. The Fish and Wildlife Service had hoped to exploit her fish hold by allowing her to harvest fish and bring them in for sale like a commercial trawler, with the proceeds going to defray some of the cost of operating her. This proved impractical, however, the idea was abandoned after her first few voyages, and financial shortfalls began to plague her operating schedule. In 1950 she had to suspend operations in September. In February 1951, the Fish and Wildlife Service loaned her to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution at Woods Hole, Massachusetts, for work under an Office of Naval Research contract, and this provided the funding to allow her to resume operations. In 1952 the Fish and Wildlife Service operated her itself under a similar contract. She finally returned to fisheries research in March 1953. She again ceased operations due to funding shortfalls in September 1953 and was tied up at Woods Hole. In January 1954 the Fish and Wildlife Service obtained new funds for her operations, and Albatross III resumed fisheries research and operated continually until March 1959, coming under the control of the Fish and Wildlife Services new Bureau of Commercial Fisheries as a result of a 1956 reorganization of the Fish and Wildlife Service's activities. During her active life she made 128 fisheries research and oceanographic cruises off New England and in adjacent areas. Much of her work related to the program of the International Commission for the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries, which was concerned with the regulation of the fisheries in the area, and made substantial contributions to the study of the use of the groundfish resources of the northwest Atlantic. Her work laid the foundation for a broader and more intensive program of investigation of the fisheries of the area, developing knowledge required for intelligent management of the fisheries, and improving understanding of the relation of environmental conditions to the productivity of the fishery resources in the area. =Decommissioning and disposal= Faced with increasing maintenance and operational costs for the aging ship, the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries decommissioned Albatross III in March 1959. She was sold to the Island Steamship Line of Hyannis, Massachusetts, in November 1959.

King Sigismund was betrothed in 1409 to Barbara of Cilli, the youngest daughter of Count Hermann II, who had saved the king's life at the Battle of Nikopolis. The Count became one of Sigismund's most powerful advisers, and it was easy for him to obtain the bishopric of Freising for his son Hermann when it suddenly fell vacant. At this time Hermann was studying in Bologna, when on 26 July 1412 Pope John XXII, on the intervention of the German emperor Sigismund, named him Bishop of Freising. As he was still too young to be consecrated a bishop, he received a papal dispensation allowing him to rule in Freising. He had to borrow 10,000 Gulden from his father to pay the annates due to the papacy. On 8 September 1413 he was anointed bishop. Hubert Strzewitzek: Die Sippenbeziehungen der Freisinger Bischöfe im Mittelalter. München 1938, pp. 163 f. The cathedral chapter of Freising was entirely taken by surprise by the sudden death of Bishop Konrad von Hebenstreit and the equally sudden nomination of Hermann, which prevented it from exercising its right of election. From 1414 to 1418 Hermann took part in the Council of Constance, where he represented the interests of king Sigismund. In the summer of 1419 he agreed an alliance with the bishops of the ecclesiastical province of Salzburg, under the leadership of the Archbishop, for the protection of their spiritual Immunitätsrechte with the promise of mutual support against the territorial princes.J.

The Papal nomination took place on 29 March 1421, but Martin V was oblige to rescind it on 13 September 1421, as the cathedral chapter of Trent were not willing to accept Hermann, because of his severe hernia. In order to regain Trent he returned to Cilli in late autumn and underwent an operation, which he did not survive. Hubert Strzewitzek: Die Sippenbeziehungen der Freisinger Bischöfe im Mittelalter.

In January 2014 he launched a social media campaign called Find 'Mike' to search for a stranger who had talked him out of taking his own life in 2008. The purpose of the campaign was to raise awareness of suicide and mental illness. It went viral and received global media attention. Within just two weeks Jonny found the stranger he was looking for, Neil Laybourn. The story of the campaign was made into a documentary film, The Stranger on the Bridge, that was released in May 2014.Finding Mike Film, \\"Finding Mike-The Film\\", \\"Rethink Mental Illness\\" Background Jonny Benjamin began having mental health problems at the age of 10 when he started experiencing auditory hallucination. He later developed depression at 16 and was eventually diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, a combination of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, in his early 20s. He had also been experiencing the delusion that he was on his own version of the film, The Truman Show, and was hospitalised as a result of his condition in January 2008. He ran away from the hospital intending to take his life by jumping off a bridge. A passerby found him on Waterloo Bridge and talked him out of committing suicide, which lasted long enough for the emergency services to arrive and return him to hospital. This incident became the focus of his 2014 campaign, Find Mike. Activism In 2011, Benjamin started vlogging about his experiences of mental health issues on YouTube in order \\"to reach out to others with mental health difficulties.\\" In 2012 a book of his poems, Pill After Pill: Poems From A Schizophrenic Mind, was published. The poetry was written mostly during his stay in hospital in 2008.\\"Pill After Pill: Poems From A Schizophrenic Mind\\", Amazon.com, 2 February 2012 By 2013 his vlogs had drawn thousands of views and he was awarded the first annual Janey Antoniou award by the mental health charity, Rethink Mental Illness, for his mental health campaigning. Of the motivation behind his work, Benjamin said: \\"I know that a lot of people are reluctant to get help, and a lot of that is because of stigma. But the only way we’ll get rid of stigma is if we are more open and talk about mental illness. There is no shame or embarrassment in it. These are human experiences.\\" He has also presented a BBC Three documentary about mental illness. Find 'Mike' campaign and media coverage On 14 January 2014 Jonny Benjamin launched a social media campaign called Find 'Mike' with the charity Rethink Mental Illness. He launched a public campaign to find the stranger that had talked him out of jumping off a bridge, to raise awareness of mental health and suicide. He did not know the man's name, so nicknamed him \\"Mike\\". He later said of it: \\"I wanted to let people know that it’s ok to have suicidal thoughts and feelings. I also hoped to show people that through talking about it, and by having someone else listen, it is possible to overcome the darkness that overwhelms a person when they feel helpless. This is something that I learned from my exchange with Neil on the bridge six years ago, and a message that I’ve been trying to pass on to others.\\" The campaign was supported by various high-profile people including Stephen Fry, Boy George, and British Prime Minister David Cameron. Millions of people shared the story online and the hashtag \\"FindMike\\" trended in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and Canada. Two weeks after the campaign was launched, Benjamin was reunited with the stranger, a man called Neil Laybourn. He came forward after his girlfriend saw the plea on Facebook. Laybourn said of the incident on the bridge that \\"maybe it was fate, it was easy to make a connection. There are people who would walk past and there are those who would have taken action. I am proud that I was in the crowd that took action.\\" A documentary film about the campaign produced by Postcard Productions was released in May 2014. Subsequent campaigns In 2016 Jonny launched ThinkWell, an initiative to bring mental health education into schools. ThinkWell is designed to educate young people about mental health and break down the stigma surrounding mental illness and suicide through school workshops. Each session is delivered by a trained workshop leader and a qualified therapist. In the same year, he travelled to India as part of his campaigns to change attitudes and reduce stigma. He filmed his journey to India for a short documentary on his YouTube channel.Benjamin, Jonny,\\"A Passage Through India\\" \\"YouTube\\", 4 September 2016 Benjamin gives talks in schools, prisons and hospitals to try and inspire others who may be struggling. Since 2017, Neil Laybourn has worked full-time for Benjamin's campaigns, and the two also ran the London Marathon together in the same year. In May 2018, he published his memoir, titled The Stranger on the Bridge.

Morgan is most notable for appearing on Bravo's reality television series The Real Housewives of New York City. She was previously married to John Adams Morgan, whose father was the co-founder of Morgan Stanley and great-grandfather was J.P. Morgan. Morgan started a fashion line called Sonja by Sonja Morgan in 2015.  Career  Morgan worked as a fashion model in Paris and Milan before studying marketing at the Fashion Institute of Technology. Morgan owns a wine company called Tipsy Girl, which distributes Prosecco and sparkling Rosé, and runs her own fashion lifestyle brand. Her fashion line, Sonja by Sonja Morgan, was launched in 2015 and is sold at the Vanessa Noel store on East 64th Street and online.

She has been a regular cast member of Bravo's reality television series The Real Housewives of New York City since its third season, joining the cast in 2010. A philanthropist, Morgan has contributed to charities involving children, visual and performing arts, animal rights groups, and LGBTQ rights.

They were married from 1998 until 2006. They have one daughter, Quincy Morgan. Morgan's divorce left her in financial ruin.

Boyne said Morgan invited her to a dinner with Trump, modeling agent John Casablancas, and five or six models. Boyne alleged that Trump made the models walk across the table, looked under their skirts, and described if they were wearing underwear. Morgan told The Huffington Post that the dinner took place with those participants, did not recall lewd behaviour by Trump, and said: \\"But I have been known to dance on tables.\\" In September 2020, Morgan spoke publicly about her experiences with cosmetic surgery.

History Since the beginning of the 2nd century BC, the impetuous economic and demographic development had made the former river port in the Forum Boarium totally inadequate: moreover, it could not be enlarged due to its vicinity to the hills. Therefore in 193 BC the censors Lucius Aemilius Lepidus and Lucius Aemilius Paulus established to face the problem by building a new port within a free area on the border of the town, south of the Aventine Hill. On that occasion the Porticus Aemilia was also erected. In 174 BC the Emporium was paved with stones and divided with walls and ladders descending to the Tiber. Here there was the docking place of the wares and raw materials (especially marbles, wheat, wine, oil); they reached the harbor of Ostia by sea and went up the river on barges pulled by buffaloes (towpath). During the centuries, the fragments of the amphorae (then used as containers for the handling of liquid foods), were clumped until they created the still-existing hill of shards: the ancient name of Mons Testaceum (\\"Hill of Shards\\") derived from it. The number of stacked-up amphorae is estimated to be about 25 million. During the reign of Trajan, new opus mixtum structures were erected, while the plain of Testaccio was gradually filled with warehouses, especially for foodstuffs, with a huge hike when free distributions of wheat and other foodstuffs to citizens began to take place, starting from the age of Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus (Horrea Sempronia, Galbana, Lolliana, Seiana, Aniciana). The port was first excavated in 1868–1870, during the damming works, and then in 1952. Now there are few visible stretches, bricked in the wall of Lungotevere Testaccio: a quay long and deep, with steps and ramps toward the river, with bulging travertine blocks having holes for ships mooring, very similar – though not so well preserved – to the one in the Roman port of Aquileia. During the building of modern Testaccio quarter, severals remains of warehouses have come to light: among them, the tomb of the consul Servius Sulpicius Galba, one of the most ancient known individual sepulchres.

She has made contributions to multiple areas of cell biology, including determining the function of several genes in HIV and describing the importance of a gene's location within the cell nucleus. As a postdoctoral researcher, she produced the first functional copies of HIV, providing researchers with access to enough biologically active material to study the function of the virus's genes. She later became interested in epigenetics and nuclear reprogramming, particularly in white blood cells known as lymphocytes and embryonic stem cells. her research focuses on how gene expression patterns are inherited when cells divide, using lymphocytes as a model system. One or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from the royalsociety.org website where: Education Fisher was educated at the University of Birmingham where she was awarded a PhD in 1984 for research into antigens expressed during myelopoiesis. During her PhD she was awarded a Lady Tata Memorial Fellowship in 1983 to study gene regulation in the laboratory of Robert Gallo at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the USA. Research and career Fisher research has used lymphocytes as a model to analyse how gene expression patterns are transmitted through cell division. Fisher also explored the molecular basis of lineage choice. She studies the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms that underlie cellular differentiation and experimental reprogramming. Fisher's research activities also include pluripotency and reprogramming, polycomb repressor complexes in stem cells, cohesion function in gene expression and genome organisation with Ikaros family transcription factors (TFs). Fisher conducts her research with a cell biology and genetics approach, using current technologies to address the events involved in maintaining embryonic stem (ES) cell pluripotency versus differentiation towards mesoderm, endoderm and ectoderm, as well as the mechanisms of T cell and B cell lineage choice and differentiation. =HIV/AIDS= Fisher's discoveries in HIV were extensive and critical for future research of the virus's characteristics. She produced the first functional copies of HIV, allowing her and other scientists to access biologically active material for future research of the virus's genes. She determined the roles of several of the genes in HIV. These findings have been significant in studying and understanding different characteristics of HIV and Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV). Whilst at the NIH, Fisher developed approaches that allowed the successful introduction of exogenous DNA onto human blood cells. Two methods, protoplast fusion and electroporation, proved successful and allowed Fisher to test whether molecular clones isolated from HIV-infected cultures could generate infectious retrovirus upon transfection. Fisher showed in 1985 that molecular clones of HIV, contained within approximately 18kb of contiguous proviral DNA, were biologically active and generated cytopathic virus when introduced into primary human T-cells. This discovery was important s it established that products of the viral genome itself, rather than a cofactor or contaminant, were capable of killing human T cells and were therefore potentially capable of mediating the immunosuppressive effect of HIV. It also provided the basis for dissecting the molecular function of each of the viral genes and for developing DNA-based diagnostic tests for HIV infection. In the following 4 years, Fisher showed that the transactivator gene tat was essential for virus replication, that truncation of the 3' open reading frame (ORF) disrupts virus cytopathogenicity, and that sor (now called vif) is required for efficient cell to cell transmission of HIV virus. With clinical collaborators from the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (Redfield and Looney), Fisher showed that patient antisera displayed type-specific neutralising properties and that multiple HIV isolates derived from a single patient were biologically diverse and contained replication-competent as well as replication-incompetent cytopathic variants. These studies performed more than 20 years ago, gave some of the first hints that a successful HIV vaccine might prove difficult to engineer. = Human T cell development = Fisher moved from the US to the UK in 1987 to study human T cell development. She established the first human thymus organ cultures in 1990, based on studies pioneered by Owen and Jenkinson in the mouse. This refinement allowed cell- fate to be mapped in vitro and provided a system in which potential factors that shape the human T cell repertoire could be experimentally tested. She spent a further 3 years training in mouse genetics, transgenic and knockout technologies at the Institut de génétique et de biologie moléculaire et cellulaire (IGBMC) Strasbourg, before being invited by the Medical Research Council to establish a research team with her partner Matthias Merkenschlager at what was then the Clinical Sciences Centre (CSC). Fisher joined the CSC in 1993, and subsequently became its director in 2008. At the CSC her work has focused on understanding gene regulation during cell commitment. In January 2017, the CSC was renamed the MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences (MRC LMS). =Epigenetics and Chromatin= In 1997, Fisher's group published an important paper on the DNA-binding factor Ikaros, that at the time was presumed to be a transcriptional activator. Fisher's group showed that Ikaros proteins unexpectedly localised to percentric heterochromatin in cycling lymphocytes in association with transcriptionally silent genes. This provided some of the first evidence that where a gene is located inside the nucleus may be relevant for its expression. The development of three dimensional (3D) immuno-FISH techniques by Fisher's team, in which the protein structure and the nuclear architecture of a sample remains preserved, was critical for revealing the spatial distribution of chromosomes and the genes within the nucleus. In the last 15 years, analogous approaches have been widely used to interrogate the relationship between gene function and nuclear organisation. For example, studies showed that Ikaros- target genes in T and B cells were recruited to pericentric heterochromatin domains only when gene silencing was inherited by daughter cells. This study, together with others, established that the nuclear location, physical compaction and local chromatin environment of many genes was important for maintaining heritable silencing. Subsequent studies to characterise the differences between transient and heritable/permanent silencing revealed that several silent genes that were assumed to replicate late during synthesis phase (S-phase) of the cell cycle (based on Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) detection of doublet signals), actually replicated much earlier (based on quantitative increases in DNA content). This discovery in 2003, led Fisher and Merkenschlager to hypothesis that – rather than altering the time of DNA replication – heritable gene silencing could retard chromatid separation and resolution. From this viewpoint they began a series of studies that have subsequently shown the involvement of cohesin complexes in gene regulation and in 2002, Fisher was awarded the EMBO Gold Medal in recognition of her early work on HIV, and the role of nuclear organisation in gene regulation. Since 2003, Fisher has been studying gene regulation in embryonic stem cells (ES), as a model for understanding pluripotency, lineage commitment and lineage restriction. In 2006, she showed that the promoters of many lineage-specifying genes in ES cells were simultaneously enriched for modified histones thought to mark either active genes (such as acetylation of H3K9, di- and tri-methylation of H3K4), or repressed domains ( such as tri-methylation of H3K27). This discovery ran contrary to the prevailing dogma of the time: that chromatin markers of actively transcribed and inactive domains were mutually exclusive. The study was published in 2006, contemporaneously with similar reports from several US-based groups. suggesting that important developmental regulator genes might be poised for transcription in ES cells, yet repressed by the activity of Polycomb Repressor Complexes (PRCs). =Awards and honours= Fisher was elected a member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) in 2001 and awarded the EMBO Gold Medal in 2002 in recognition of her work on nuclear organisation and gene expression, as well as for her research on the molecular characterisation of the HIV/AIDS. In 2014, she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Her nomination reads: In 2003 she was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) for excellence in her contributions to medicine and society. Fisher organises and participates in a range of public engagement projects and events, and in recognition of this work she received an 'Outstanding Women in Science Award for communication in Science, Engineering Technology (SET) award in March 2010. Fisher was awarded the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres International Fellow award in 2015. Fisher was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to medical research and the public understanding of science.

Around 2600 people were living on those islands in 2011.Lorraine Guay, Quebec islands, collection: the Regions of Quebec, Brief History, Laval University Press, 2011 Islands Dupas and Saint-Ignace-de-Loyola are partially urbanized. The majority of the other islands are used for agriculture and grazing farm animals. A network of small roads, often unpaved crosses the riparian environment of the islands. The islands of Saint-Ignace-de-Loyola, Dupas and Castors (Beavers) are connected to the north side of St. Lawrence River by a small network of bridges. The connection between the two sides of St. Lawrence River) is provided by a ferry service between Sorel and Saint-Ignace Island (the largest island of the archipelago). Most of the other islands are accessible only by boat. The south side of the river, the \\"Île des Embarras\\" (Embarrassment Island) is the smallest of the inhabited islands.  Geology  The Archipelago of Lake Saint Pierre is a delta from the last glaciation and modified by the alluvium of St. Lawrence River.It is a channel flowing into a plain of sand and clay. Following the withdrawal of the ice cap, the Sorel Islands region was invaded by the Champlain Sea which is then withdrawn gradually, about 12000 years ago. Clayey marine sediments were deposited at the bottom of the water.This Mateau clay reached in 2011 several water depths; so it is about deep to Berthierville The visible part of the islands of the Archipelago is formed of recent alluvium. These deposits with a maximum height of above the river level consist mainly of silt deposited by the Champlain Sea at the back that forced marine waters this time to integrate the current riverbed. Today, the same phenomenon is repeated annually during spring floodingThese spring floods have led islanders to build buildings and houses on stilts. Even today, gathering maple sap during sugaring is done by boat to the islands. while the waters of the river cover a portion of the Sorel Islands and will leave a layer alluvium. Although they can cause problems and damage to the island for a few weeks to travel, the spring floods are beneficial to agriculture.The alluvial deposits left after the removal of spring flooding is an important contribution of beneficial organic matter to grain production Islands.  Topography  The St. Lawrence River widens the entrance of Lake Saint Pierre which forms a delta archipelago of hundreds of islands and islets. Several channels crisscross between these islands. This region is characterized by a very few marked relief. The slope is above sea level Most of the islands are widely flooded every spring.

It was not until 1665 that a new fort was rebuilt by the company of Captain Pierre de Saurel from Carignan. In La Visitation-de-l'Île- Dupas, Quebec in the summer, the islands are grazing in the open, no fences. A few years later, in 1672, demobilized soldiers are the first settlers in the Archipelago.Intendant Jean Talon rewarded 25 officers of the Carignan granting them fiefs which settled on soldiers demobilized as census. Thus was born the stronghold of Dorvillier granted Oct. 29, 1672. The exploitation of communal grazing on the islands finds its origin here.

The Seminary is located on Main street directly in downtown Košice, Slovakia. It has five floors. The first three are the Faculty of Theology of the Catholic University in Ružomberok. The seminary is on the fourth and fifth floors of the building, which consists of the St Charles Borromeo Seminary Chapel, the seminarians rooms, Borromeo Magazine editorial office, a meditation room, a small gym, a billiard room, infirmary rooms, and the seminary kitchen. St Charles Borromeo Seminary Chapel in Košice A number of priests reside in the seminary building who most of them teach on the Faculty of Theology. During the first two years, the seminarians focus on philosophical studies and the remaining three years focus on theological studies. Between second and third year, the seminarians take a pastoral year lasting one academic school year where they work in an assigned parish. This accounts for a total of 5 years of formation in the seminary, and 2 years of formation outside the seminary (pastoral year, diaconate year). At the end of every academic year, in June, the fifth year seminarians are ordained to the diaconate and serve within the Archdiocese of Košice. The following June, having completed one year of service as deacons, they are ordained to the priesthood. Typical present day seminary room History Before the establishment of an independent diocese, the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Košice belonged to the Diocese of Eger. In 1347 the city received privileges from Louis the Great, and made Košice ranked second among all cities in Hungary.Hišem (2000), p. 64. The city was inspired by the Reformation. After a city fire on April 13, 1556 the Dominicans and Franciscans left Košice. The Catholics in Košice were left without priests. During the pontificate of Pope Gregory XIII, the papal diplomat António Possevino SJ stayed and worked in Košice from September to December 1583. It was he that stressed in a letter to Pope Gregory XIII, about the urgent need to set up a seminary in Košice, to form Catholic priests. However, his proposal was not realized at that time.Hišem (2000), p. 65-66. =Kisdyanum Seminary in Košice= Benedikt Kisdy, the bishop of Eger canonically established the University of Košice on February 26, 1657 in Jasov and entrusted it to the care and administration of the Jesuit order. Emperor Leopold I with his Bulla aurea (Golden Bull) confirmed this university on August 7, 1660 in Graz. However, the university's Faculty of Theology could not exist without a seminary. The founding charter for the establishment of the Seminary was issued by Bishop Thomas Pálfy on June 4, 1664 in Košice. St Ladislaus became the patron saint of the seminary, which became known as the Kisdyanum - by his benefactor, Bishop Benedikt Kisdy. The Kisdyanum building was located on 2 Alžbetina Street (now Building Investment and Development Bank). The Kisdyanum adopted the rules and regulations for its seminary formation from the Pázmáneum in Vienna. At the Kisdyanum, the seminarians were formed by Jesuits for the Diocese of Eger and took their courses at the University. There were on average 40 seminarians for the diocese, in addition to many seminarians of various religious orders such as the Jesuits (around 20 seminarians) as well as Franciscans and Premonstratensians. The Kisdyanum Seminary was active alongside the newer seminary in Eger (since 1709), which both formed seminarians to the priesthood for the Diocese of Eger. The Kisdyanum was active until 1760, when the bishop of Eger, František Barkóczy liquidated it, sold the building, and used the funds for the seminary in Eger. The University of Košice existed until 1777, when on August 27, 1777 Maria Theresa issued a decree Ratio Educationis that demanded only one university in the kingdom, and that in Buda.Hišem (2000), p. 68-76. =Creation of the Diocese of Košice and St Charles Borromeo Seminary= The Holy Roman Emperor, Francis II, exercising his power as Apostolic Emperor, divided the Diocese of Eger on February 23, 1804, created the dioceses of Košice and Szatmária, and elevated the diocese of Eger to an archdiocese. The Diocese of Košice became suffragan to the Archdiocese of Eger. Pope Pius VII confirmed the splitting of the diocese of Eger on August 9, 1804 in the bull: In Universi gregis Dominica cura. Francis II also demanded, that every diocese in the kingdom is to have its own seminary to form seminarians for its diocese. Consequently, the construction of the new Seminary in Košice began in 1805. Seminarians starting their first year of theology were in Košice by 1809, even though the building was not yet completed. At the beginning of the 1811/12 academic school year, the seminary building was blessed by the first bishop of the Košice Diocese, Msgr. Andrej Szabó † (20 Aug 1804 Appointed - 28 Sep 1819 Died). Out of respect to the first rector Karol Rajner, the seminary was entrusted to the patronage of Saint Charles Borromeo and was named St Charles Borromeo Seminary (). It was also this academic school year that for the first time had a complete seminary - seminarians in all grades.Hišem (2000), p. 83-85. =The Seminary during World War II and the First Slovak Republic= The Seminary experienced a difficult time following the First Vienna Award in 1938, which was the result of the First Vienna Arbitration, a direct consequence of the Munich Agreement, which separated Košice and its surroundings from CzechoSlovakia and gave it to Hungary. Most seminarians, wanting to remain Slovaks, left Košice and continued studying theology in various other diocesan seminaries in Slovakia. There remained only nine seminarians in the Seminary who were originally from the Košice region. These nine Slovaks were joined by the Hungarian seminarians from the Archdiocese of Eger. Most of the superiors and professors of the Seminary in Košice were of Hungarian nationality.Hišem (2000), p. 151. With the moving of state borders in 1938 along with the creation of the First Slovak Republic in 1939 and consequently the moving of borders of ecclesiastical provinces, Košice and the Seminary suddenly found themselves part of the Ecclesiastical Province of Eger. Following those events, Bishop Joseph Čársky because of Canon Law regulations, had to leave Košice on September 8, 1939 and by the papal bull Dioecesium fine was appointed to Prešov as the Košice Apostolic Administrator of those parts of the dioceses of Košice, Szatmária and Rožňava which still remained in Slovakia after all border changes. Bishop Stephen Madarász came to Košice on September 16, 1939 as the new Bishop of the Diocese of Košice which now belonged to Hungary.Hišem (2000), p. 93. =The Liquidation of the Seminary in Košice= After the return of Košice from Hungary to CzechoSlovakia in 1945, the Diocese of Košice was entrusted once again to Bishop Joseph Čársky. The superiors of the Seminary left with their bishop back to Hungary. Due to war conditions, Bishop Joseph Čársky set up the Seminary in September 1945. The Seminary did not last very long after the war. With the rise of communism, formation and studies in the Seminary in Košice were terminated in June 1950. The seminarians could complete their exams only on the basis of the decisions of the state authorities, to enroll in separate organized courses. Whereas the seminarians declined to participate in such activities, they were called into special military units. At the end of the school year, as a call to false reports, everyone in the seminary including the superiors, professors, and seminarians were locked by police force into the seminary chapel, and the police examined the entire building in search of weapons hidden in the building. No weapons were ever found, regardless the Seminary was to be liquidated. On July 10, 1950 Bishop Joseph Čársky was notified by the Slovak Seizure Office for Ecclesiastical Affairs, that St Charles Borromeo Seminary in Košice is to be liquidated, and its superiors will be issued to spiritual administration in the diocese. On July 11 and 12, 1950 the seminary building was written over to the socialist government. The buildings being in usable condition were taken by the Regional National Committee of Ecclesiastical Separation in Košice. The seminary buildings were used by many schools and organizations and later became a Conservatory and Home for Young People. The beautiful seminary garden was destroyed and transformed into a parking lot. By government decree 112/1950 on July 26, 1950, after 159 years of forming seminarians into priests, the Seminary was definitely liquidated. The seminarians were not to return and in fact, had no school to return to. Only part of the seminarians were allowed to move to Bratislava and complete their studies in the only communist regime allowed seminary in Slovakia: Sts. Cyril and Methodius Seminary (). The other seminarians, who were not allowed to continue their studies had to find some other school or many tried to find work. Admittance to the Sts. Cyril and Methodius Seminary in Bratislava was closely under surveillance by the communist regime. Many young men from all over Slovakia, wanting to become priests did not give up hope and every year applied to the Seminary in Bratislava, though many times with no avail. Meanwhile, waiting to be accepted to the Seminary in Bratislava, these young men found jobs wherever possible, always hoping. Some of them eventually married.Hišem (2000), p. 195-200. Among those accepted to the Sts. Cyril and Methodius Seminary in Bratislava is Archbishop Emeritus of the Archdiocese of Košice Msgr. Alojz Tkáč. For three years he tried to apply to the Seminary in Bratislava, always with no answer. Meanwhile, he studied at the Faculty of Philosophy at the Comenius University in Bratislava. The young Alojz Tkáč was finally accepted on his fourth application to the seminary and enrolled there into the 1953/54 academic school year.Arcibiskup Tkáč retrieved 28 May 2014 =Renewal of St Charles Borromeo Seminary= After the fall of communism in 1989, following the Act on the Mitigation of certain property injustices, the Diocese of Košice on January 23, 1992 once again became the owner of the seminary building. On Holy Thursday, April 16, 1992 Bishop Msgr. Alojz Tkáč for the first time publicly expressed his intention to renew St Charles Borromeo Seminary in Košice. On April 5, 1993 Msgr. Anton Konečný referred to Bishop Msgr. Alojz Tkáč the condition of the seminary building and its possible restoration. From June to September 1993 the Conservatory and Home for Young People moved out. On July 31, 1993 Msgr. Anton Konečný was appointed rector of the Seminary Church - St Anthony of Padua. On March 31, 1994 according to the Code of Canon Law, by Cann. 232, 233, and 237, Bishop Msgr. Alojz Tkáč renewed St Charles Borromeo Seminary. As the first rector of the renewed seminary, or 23rd rector since 1811, he named Msgr. Anton Konečný and as vice-rector Mgr. Jozef Ondovčák. Reparations began immediately, as the building was in desolate conditions. Accepted into the first academic year (1994/95) were 31 seminarians of various ages, even those, who for many years tried to enroll to the Seminary in Bratislava but unsuccessfully. The new seminarians arrived to the renewed Seminary in Košice on Monday September 26, 1994. The glorious opening of St Charles Borromeo Seminary in Košice took place on October 4, 1994 with the pontifical Te Deum Holy Mass celebrated by Metropolitan Archbishop Msgr. Ján Sokol and con-celebrated by Msgr. Alojz Tkáč (Bishop of the Diocese of Košice) who also said the homily, Msgr. Bernard Bober (Auxiliary Bishop of the Diocese of Košice), Msgr. Eduard Kojnok (Bishop of the Diocese of Rožňava), Msgr. František Tondra (Bishop of the Diocese of Spiš), and Msgr. Andrej Imrich (Auxiliary Bishop of the Diocese of Spiš). On October 15, 1994 Bishop Msgr. Alojz Tkáč blessed the new Seminary Chapel with patronage of St Charles Borromeo.Hišem (2000), p. 201. =Pope John Paul II's papal visit to the Seminary in Košice= On March 31, 1995 at noon in the Seminary Chapel, Bishop Msgr. Alojz Tkáč and Pope John Paul II at St Peter's Square simultaneously announced together, that the Holy See had created the new Ecclesiastical Province of Košice with its seat in Košice. At that same moment, Msgr. Alojz Tkáč was appointed as Metropolitan Archbishop of the new Ecclesiastical Province of Košice and so, the status of the Diocese of Košice was changed to Archdiocese of Košice - suffragan dioceses: Spiš and Rožňava. The following year in 1995, the Holy See and Pope John Paul II planned a papal visit of the new Ecclesiastical Province of Košice. While the Roman Pontiff was to be in Košice, Bishop Msgr. Alojz Tkáč wished for him to reside in the new St Charles Borromeo Seminary. This urged the city of Košice to help and speed up the repairs of the seminary building. On July 2, 1995, Pope John Paul II celebrated an open-air Papal Holy Mass at the Košice Airport with 400,000 people present. During that Papal Holy Mass in Košice, John Paul II beatified the Three Košice Martyrs and also bestowed the pallium to the new Metropolitan Archbishop Msgr. Alojz Tkáč. John Paul II resided a short while in the St Charles Borromeo Seminary, walked the renewed hallways, prayed in the St Charles Borromeo Seminary Chapel, and rested in one of the guest rooms.Hišem (2000), p. 202. Rectors since 1811 Since its birth in 1811, the St Charles Borromeo Seminary has had 26 rectors in total.

The left part depicts half of the coat of arms of the Košice archdiocese to whom the seminary belongs. The right part depicts the attributes of the patron saint of the seminary - St Charles Borromeo. The Archdiocese of Košice coat of arms is a gold St Andrew's cross on a blue background. St Andrew the Apostle is the patron saint of the Archdiocese of Košice. The upper part has a golden lily, which symbolizes Košice and the other three gold roses symbolize the three arch-deaneries: Abov - cathedral, Šariš and Zemplín. The attributes of St Charles Borromeo are a silver cardinal's hat on a red background, which symbolizes the cardinalate. Top-center of the coat of arms is the Book of the Gospels with the Greek letters Alpha and Omega, symbolizing Jesus Christ. An open book of the Gospels is also a symbol for seminaries. Combining these themes gave birth to the coat of arms of the seminary.KSKE Coat of Arms See also * Archdiocese of Košice * St Anthony of Padua Seminary Church, Košice Notes References *Hišem, Cyril (2000).

Villard for Adult Swim; Eric Kaplan is instead the co-creator for the pilot episode. The series aired on the network's online video streaming service Adult Swim Video on June 15, 2014 before it was aired on TV. J.J. Villard was originally a writer for Cartoon Network's Uncle Grandpa and a visual development artist for DreamWorks Animation's Shrek Forever After. Synopsis The series revolves around the titular character, King Star King (Tommy Blacha): a tall, blond muscular man. After seducing his love, Princess Snow White, he falls from his higher plane of existence to serve as a fry cook in a run-down waffle house. In order to reclaim his place in the heavens, he must battle his amnesia to defeat the evil Spring Bunny and rescue Snow White. Production The pilot was announced preceding the network's 2012 upfront as part of their development slate. It was also disclosed during the upfront, and was reported again before the network's upfront the following year. It was announced as a web series for Adult Swim Video to premiere June 15, 2014; the series was advertised as \\"too shexxxy \\" for television. The network conducted an online poll whether episodes should be released daily or all at once; on June 11, the network announced it would release all six episodes of the first season simultaneously. A sweepstake for the series was announced on June 9, promoting six chances to win original artwork by Villard. The series is animated by Titmouse, Inc. and produced by J.J. Villard's vanity card, Kurtis; Mirari Films provided animation for the pilot episode. In an interview at the 2013 Comic-Con, Villard dubbed the titular character as \\"He-Man on drugs\\". Series developer Tommy Blacha went on to describe comments with the network's Standards and Practices to \\"better tell [the show].\\" When asked about the inspiration for the series, Blacha joked that Villard pitched the series to network executive Mike Lazzo with a drawing of the protagonist, to which he approved production of the pilot. The two explained that as Villard started working on it with another producer and driving Lazzo \\"crazy,\\" he abandoned the pilot; this led to Blacha joining as producer and toning it down by \\"two percent.\\" Voices * Tommy Blacha - King Star King, Hank Waffles, Gurbles, Fat Frank, Mike Balls, KWA KWA * Robin Atkin Downes - Narrator, Alfonso Molestro, Doctor, Chunkles, Hank's Mother, Tim Tumor, Carmine Excrementi, Pinchy Laroux, God Star God * J.J.

In July 2013, it was released online as part of a presentation of in-development shows for the network, partnered with KFC; viewers could vote for their favorite pilot, with the winner being broadcast on August 26, 2013. The series lost to Übermansion, a Stoopid Buddy Stoodios production, although the presentation won an Internet Advertising Campaign Award in 2014 for \\"Best TV Integrated Ad Campaign\\". Nevertheless, the pilot aired on the network's Toonami block on November 3, 2013 during the daylight saving time transition; Nielsen ratings were not captured during this period. Meredith Woerner of io9 said that the series gained their approval at its description of a \\"punk rock He-Man\\". Conversely, upon surveying the show's description, Patrick Kevin Day of the Los Angeles Times official blog dubbed the network a \\"home for stupid characters\\".

The work, which involved two parallel blocks of military accommodation, was supervised by Captain Thomas Phillips. An additional block was added between 1739 and 1741. After the Napoleonic Wars the barracks were abandoned but put back into use in the 1850s. Following the Childers Reforms, the barracks became the depot of the King's Own Scottish Borderers, who arrived from Fulford Barracks in July 1881. The regiment moved out of the barracks in 1963 and they are now maintained by English Heritage.

Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf as guest of the Fraumünster association in 2012 Historical clothing of the women of the society Flag of the society upright upright Spectaculum at the Münsterhof square in May 2014  History of Gesellschaft zu Fraumünster  In medieval times, in Zürich all female and male Bürger were members of the guilds, but beginning in the 19th century women were no more tolerated within the guilds then more as decoration of their men being still members of the guilds of Zürich. The history of the Gesellschaft zu Fraumünsters dates back to the late 9th century when the abbess of the Fraumünster Abbey (853 A.D.) in fact reigned the city of Zürich as Fürstäbtissin (imperial abbess) nominated by the king of the Holy Roman Empire, among them Katharina von Zimmern. Gesellschaft zu Fraumünster, being the society of the former noble women of the Fraumünster Abbey, was established in 1989. Now, the honorable women of the society cultivate the virtuous habits of the former abbey by p.e. honoring the work of engaged women in the modern society. Beginning fifteen years ago, the society started to organize every three years the so-called Mittelalter Spectaculum, a medieval funfair, at the Münsterhof square.  Sechseläuten and the guilds of Zürich  Since 2010 the guilds of Zürich allow to the women of the society to practice Sechseläuten, as guests of the Constaffel society, for historical reasons as until 1524 AD the abbesses of the Fraumünster abbey were members of the Constaffel. As of November 2014, expressly agreed by the guilds of Zürich, the Fraumünster society – still as guest, not as an official member – may practice Sechseläuten provisorily until 2022, as also confirmed by the association (Zentralkomitee der Zünfte) of the Zürich guilds. Mrs Regula Zweifel, representative of the Fraumünster society, told in an interview on 6 November 2014, ″... after 25 years, the tug of war is finally over. The fact that we now have guest status at Sechseläutenplatz, is great. But it is only a first step ...″ The association of guild members will, on occasion of an official ceremony, sign an agreement between the Fraumünster society and the so-called Zunftmeister's (literally: masters of the guilds) in December 2014: as long as the agreement applies, the Fraumünster society may participate namely the Sechseläuten procession and Böögg burning, but neither do any steps to join the assembly of the Zürich guilds nor participate other activities related to Sechseläuten.  Activities  The association organizes monthly meetings, and its members are involved in numerous cultural projects, among them the honor book for women, a silent memorial to all women who do extraordinary things in everyday life and shape society actively. Every three years the \\"Mittelalter Spectaculum\\" at the Münsterhof plaza is organized. Each year, the society honors posthumously female personalities with a plaque at their site of action in Zürich, and publishes a New Year's sheet.  Notable women awarded by the association  The Fraumünster society posthumously honors women who have provided outstanding professional services or social innovations in Zürich. The honoring take place on the morning of the Sechseläuten festival and are public. Whenever possible, a plaque is attached to a former residence or place of activity of the honored women. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" - ! width=\\"120\\"  Name ! width=\\"150\\"  EN-WP wiki ! width=\\"12\\"  born ! width=\\"12\\"  died ! width=\\"12\\"  honor ! width=\\"270\\"  remarks ! width=\\"120\\"  location --  Bullinger, Anna Anna Bullinger-Adlischwyler  align=middle 1500 (around)  align=middle 1564  align=middle 2017  Former nun of the Oetenbach Nunnery who married Heinrich Bullinger after the Reformation in Zürich  Zwingliplatz 4 (Carolinum Zürich) 100px --  Escher, Mathilde  Mathilde Escher  align=middle 1808  align=middle 1875  align=middle 2015  Founded the Mathilde-Escher foundation in Zürich  St. Annagasse 11 100px --  Fierz, Maria  Maria Fierz  align=middle 1878  align=middle 1956  align=middle 2016  Funding of the internal cohesion of the urban population  --  Lieberherr, Emilie  Emilie Lieberherr  align=middle 1924 align=middle 2011  align=middle 2014  First women member of the Council of States (Switzerland) and first women city councillor in Zürich  in progress --  Gutknecht, Rosa  Rosa Gutknecht  align=middle 1885  align=middle 1959  align=middle 2013  Theologician and assistant pastor at the Grossmünster church  Zwingliplatz 1 --  Feller, Elisabeth  Elisabeth Feller  align=middle 1910  align=middle 1973  align=middle 2012  Independent entrepreneur, feminist and patron of the arts  Stockerstrasse 9 --  Birch-Pfeiffer, Charlotte  Charlotte Birch-Pfeiffer  align=middle 1800  align=middle 1868  align=middle 2011  First women theatre director (1837–1843) in Switzerland  Schauspielhaus, Heimplatz --  Heim-Vögtlin, Marie  Marie Heim-Vögtlin  align=middle 1845 align=middle 1916  align=middle 2010  First female Swiss physician, a writer and a co-founder of the first Swiss gynaecological hospital.

A Serb, Osmokruhović held secret meetings in the Slavonian Military Frontier, in which many Serbs took part in. He was also supported by the judges of Koprivnica and Ivanica, Ilija Romanović and Nikola Vuković, and they all sent letters to the Austrian Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor about the issues in March 1666. Appointed the commander of the Varaždin frontiersmen themselves and named great judge (Veliki Sudac), he claimed to answer to no one besides the Austrian Emperor, and sought that the frontiersmen's right to ownership of the land between the Sava and Drava be recognized, among other issues. Austrian lieutenant general Fra Johann Josef Herberstein (1639-1689) went to Križevci and demanded that his candidate be accepted as great judge, but the candidate was murdered by the frontiersmen.

Its parent regiment is the 27th Field Artillery Regiment. First constituted during World War I as Battery B of the 27th Field Artillery, it remained stateside with the 9th Division. The battery was reactivated as part of the 27th in 1940 and served with the 27th Armored Field Artillery Battalion during World War II with the 1st Armored Division. Postwar, it briefly formed part of the United States Constabulary in Germany before being inactivated yet again in 1948. During most of the 1950s the battery and its battalion served with the 1st Armored Division after being reactivated, but again inactivated due to the Combat Arms Regimental System reorganization in 1957. Under the reorganization the battery became the 2nd Battalion of the regiment, serving with the 3rd Armored Division in Germany for most of the Cold War, before being inactivated and reflagged in 1988.  History  The battalion was constituted during World War I on 5 July 1918 as Battery B of the 27th Field Artillery, a National Army unit, part of the 9th Division. The battery was organized on 2 August at Camp McClellan, Alabama, but remained stateside and was demobilized there after the end of the war on 8 February 1919. The battery was reconstituted, but remained inactive, with the 9th Division on 24 March 1923; its regiment was relieved from that division on 1 October 1933. On 15 July 1940 the battery was reactivated with the 27th Field Artillery Battalion (FAB) at Fort Knox, assigned to the 1st Armored Division. On 1 January 1942 the 27th FAB became an armored unit, the 27th Armored Field Artillery Battalion (AFAB). With the 27th AFAB, Battery B fought in North Africa and Italy during World War II, receiving the Croix de Guerre with Palm for actions in Central Italy. The battery was one of the first 1st Armored Division units to arrive in Italy during Operation Avalanche, the Salerno landings in September 1943. Alongside Battery C, it went into action on the night of 11 September, covering a key stream crossing with direct fire. On 12 September both batteries pulled back to support the 45th Infantry Division with indirect fire, helping to repel the strongest German counterattack against the beachhead between 12 and 14 September. On the night of 13 September, the seven M7 Priest 105mm self- propelled howitzers of the battery fired 300 rounds against the German counterattack. Exercise Reforger '85, with an M109A2 self-propelled howitzer in the background After the end of the war, it garrisoned Allied-occupied Germany after being redesignated as Troop B of the 27th Constabulary Squadron (formed from the 27th AFAB), part of the 14th Constabulary Regiment. On 20 December 1948, the squadron was inactivated, returning to its former designation and assignment, when the 14th became a regular unit again with the intensification of the Cold War. The battalion was reactivated at Fort Hood with the division on 7 March 1951. On 15 February 1957, it was inactivated yet again at Fort Polk and relieved from its assignment to the division. On 30 August 1957, it became the 2nd Howitzer Battalion of the 27th Artillery under the Combat Arms Regimental System. 2-27 FA was activated in Germany on 1 October, assigned to the 3rd Armored Division Artillery. It took over the personnel and equipment of the 3rd Armored's 67th Armored Field Artillery Battalion, armed with the M52 105 mm self-propelled howitzer. On 1 October 1963 it dropped the Howitzer designation, with its parent regiment being redesignated as the 27th Field Artillery on 1 September 1971. The battalion was based at Ray Barracks, Friedberg, Germany, as a direct support unit for the 3rd Brigade of the 3rd Armored Division, armed with the 155 mm self- propelled howitzer. It included three batteries with six howitzers each. On 16 January 1988, 2-27 FA was inactivated and relieved from its assignment to the 3rd Armored. Its personnel and equipment were transferred to the simultaneously reactivated 2nd Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery. = Known commanders = * Lieutenant Colonel Roy T.

Joseph Johann Ludwig Uphues (23 May 1850, Sassenberg – 2 January 1911, Berlin) was a German sculptor.  Life  After an apprenticeship as a carpenter, he embarked on a two-year tour of Belgium and the Netherlands. From 1870 to 1871, he learned stone masonry in Wiedenbrück. He worked there until 1878, when he entered the Prussian Academy of Arts, studying sculpture under Reinhold Begas and Fritz Schaper. In 1882 he was enrolled in Begas' Master Student class and worked as his assistant until 1891, opening his own studio in 1892. He became a Professor at the Academy and joined the Berlin Secession in 1899.  The Siegesallee (Victory Avenue)  He was one of the sculptors commissioned to produce statues for the Siegesallee, a monumental project conceived by Kaiser Wilhelm II as his gift to the people of Berlin. Uphues produced two sets of figures, dedicated in 1899: * Group 3, with Otto II, Margrave of Brandenburg as the centerpiece, flanked by Johann Gans Edler Herr zu Putlitz (founder of the Marienfließ Monastery in Prignitz) and Heinrich von Antwerpen (Provost of Brandenburg). * Group 28, featuring Frederick the Great with side figures of Graf Kurt Christoph von Schwerin and Johann Sebastian Bach. As is the case with virtually all of the Siegesallee statues, his were damaged during World War II and are currently displayed at the Spandau Citadel. The Bach figure has disappeared.

Life Sevenoke is said to have been an orphan, found in Sevenoaks, Kent and adopted by William Rumschedde.History of Parliament Apprenticed to Henry Bois as an ironmonger, in 1397 he successfully petitioned to be readmitted as a grocer, since Bois had actually belonged to the Grocers' Mystery. He rose to prominence, being appointed Warden of London Bridge for 1404–06 and serving as Auditor of London in 1399, 1409–11 and 1414. He became an alderman in 1412 and Mayor of London for 1418–19. He was selected, as one of the two aldermanic representatives, the M.P. for the City of London in 1417.

These are still in existence and are now known as Sevenoaks School and Sevenoaks Almshouses.Sevenoaks Almshouses William Lambarde gave an account of the life of Sevenoke and the foundation of the school and almshouses in A Perambulation of Kent (1576), suggesting that his decision to establish the institutions may have been inspired by his early history.

It is located on the site of the ancient city of Bouchetion (Βουχέτιον), which was abandoned in the late 1st century BC. Re-occupied in the 9th century, it became a bishopric and was refortified, playing an important role in the region's history in the 14th and early 15th centuries. It was abandoned again after the Ottoman conquest in 1449.  Location  The castle is located west of the village of Nea Kerasounta, on a 29 m tall hill on the northern bank of the Louros river, which surrounds the base of the hill on the eastern, southern and western sides. The castle was built on the location of the acropolis of the ancient city of Bouchetion. Despite its inland location today, in Antiquity the hill seems to have been an island, and literary references confirm that Rogoi remained a coastal location in the Middle Ages as well, with the Ambracian Gulf extending further to the northwest than it does today.  History  The site was identified by 19th- century scholars with ancient Charadrus, until N. G. L. Hammond established its modern identification with the ancient city of Bouchetion. Bouchetion was an Elean colony founded in the 7th century BC, and served as the port for the inland settlements of Elatria (at the modern village of Palaioroforos, 10 km west of Rogoi) and Baties (modern Kastro Rizovouni, some 7 km to the north of Rogoi). In the 4th century, Bouchetion was incorporated into the unified kingdom of Epirus by the Molossian king Alexander I ( BC). The town followed the fortunes of the Epirote state. In 167 BC, it was sacked during the Third Macedonian War. Although its strategic location ensured that the site remained occupied thereafter, it was eventually abandoned after the foundation of Nicopolis in 28 BC. The new settlement of Rogoi is first attested in the Notitiae Episcopatuum of the Patriarchate of Constantinople as the seat of a bishopric, a suffragan of the Metropolis of Naupaktos, under the Byzantine emperor Leo VI (). It was likely resettled in the course of the 9th century, during the Byzantines' recovery of Epirus from the Slavic invaders who had taken it over in the late 6th and early 7th century. Indeed, the name \\"Rogoi\\" has been suggested as being of Slavic origin, but more likely derives from a Sicilian Greek term for \\"granaries\\", and may indicate that Sicilian settlers were brought in to establish the new settlement. In the period between and , the local inhabitants changed the course of the Louros river to its present form, aiming to drain its marshes and increase the available farmland, and possibly to enhance the protection of the castle itself, which was now surrounded on three sides by the river. The medieval settlement appears in historical sources chiefly in the 14th–15th centuries, when it played a role in the wars of various local potentates for control over Epirus. Thus it was attacked without success by Philip I, Prince of Taranto in 1303/4, when Anna Palaiologina Kantakouzene, the regent of the Despotate of Epirus, refused to acknowledge Angevin suzerainty. In 1338/9, the castle of Rogoi, along with the Epirote capital, Arta, and the fortress of Riniasa or Thomokastron, was seized by Epirote rebels under Alexios Kabasilas, who rose up against the annexation of Epirus into the Byzantine Empire in the previous year. Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos and his Grand Domestic, John Kantakouzenos, blockaded Rogoi, which was eventually persuaded to surrender by Kantakouzenos. Epirus fell into the hands of the Serbian Empire during the Byzantine civil war of 1341–47. In 1361, the Serbian emperor Simeon Urosh confirmed John Tzaphas Orsini, a relative of his wife, as lord of Rogoi and other areas in Epirus, but the actual effect of this proclamation was probably negligible, as Serbian rule was soon challenged by the attacks of Albanian tribes. By 1367, Rogoi and Arta were in the hands of the Albanian chieftain Peter Losha. After Losha's death in 1374, his domain was taken over by the fellow Albanian ruler of the Acheloos River area, John Spata. The town remained in the hands of the Spata family until 1416, when the last Albanian ruler, Yaqub Spata, was defeated by the Count palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos, Carlo I Tocco, who in 1411 had become master of Ioannina. Carlo and his brother, Leonardo II Tocco, took possession of Arta and Rogoi, thereby restoring the Despotate of Epirus to its traditional boundaries. Rogoi was finally abandoned after the Ottoman conquest of the region in 1449. Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli visited the castle in 1436 and 1448, and recorded that the relics of Saint Luke were kept in a church there; according to contemporary Serbian texts, these had been moved there from Constantinople after the fall of the city to the Fourth Crusade.  Castle layout Wall of the castle, showing the clear difference between the masonry of the ancient foundations and the later medieval reconstruction For the first two centuries of its existence, Bouchetion was apparently unfortified, and the first fortification on the site consisted of a simple circuit wall of 450 m length enclosing the flat space on the top of the hill. This was later enlarged by an irregular wall enclosing the entire northern slope of the hill, increasing the length of the outer walls to 730 m and doubling the enclosed area from 9,000 to 18,000 m2. Still later the walls were again expanded to include the northeastern part of the settlement, so that in its final extent the ancient fortifications formed an outer circuit of 1,000 m and encompassed an area of 37,000 m2. The medieval castle extant today was built on the remains of the first two phases of the ancient acropolis, and follows the course of the ancient fortifications, incorporating their foundations. The medieval outer circuit wall was largely built on the traces of the ancient walls, with the different styles of masonry making the two structures clearly discernible from each other. To these were added internal transverse walls, reinforced by towers, dividing the enclosed space into three baileys. The outer bailey also contained a monastery, of which only the 15th-century church of the Assumption remains. The castle's interior is now mostly ruined and overgrown with vegetation. The date of the Byzantine re-fortification is uncertain, possibly from as early as the site's re-occupation in the 9th century to the 13th/14th centuries. The site has not yet been excavated, except for maintenance work on the walls undertaken in the 1978–80 period.

Plot Henry Phyfe (Buttons) was a mild-mannered accountant, until circumstances forced the American Counter Intelligence Service (CIS) to recruit him to impersonate a foreign agent named U-31, who had been killed in an automobile accident. The agent looked just like Phyfe, but the two men's personalities were drastically different. That severe contrast laid the groundwork for many of the episodes. Phyfe's girlfriend, Judy Kimball, her mother Florence and his boss at the accounting firm, Mr. Hamble, were all unaware of Henry's secret life, with Gerald Hannahan, the regional director of the agency the lone person to know the secret. The characters of the girlfriend and mother-in-law were phased out halfway through the abbreviated run. Cast * Red Buttons as Henry Phyfe * Fred Clark as Gerald B.

The origins of the Pakistan Muhajir League are uncertain. There was a group bearing that name in the 1960s, until its name change on 1 January 2014. The change of name mirrored the name chosen a few weeks earlier for a party in India. The party is led by Arslan Ul Mulk, a human rights activist from Gujranwala, who has been in charge since 2011. It campaigns on issues relating to imprisonment and police torture. Mulk said it would strive to make Pakistan a country as dream of by its founder, Mohammed Ali Jinnah. Briefly detained on 3 February 2014, under the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, Mulk embarked on a series of hunger strike camps in various cities across Pakistan. Since then Mulk has been booked and detained several times by police on charges related to political activism. Mulk faces a determined opposition which sees him as a newcomer in an already crowded field of Pakistani politics, unlike Arvind Kejriwal of the Indian AAP, who drew his fame from his mentor Anna Hazare, who has led a prolonged struggle against corruption.  Ideology  Mulk says that they have a 54-point agenda that includes the elimination of hereditary politics, restoration of self-esteem of the common man, and getting rid of corruption. In April 2014, Adnan Randhawa, a former civil servant and anti-corruption activist from Burewala, formed another party bearing a similar name, the Aam Aadmi Party of Pakistan (AAPP). Randhawa had previously been involved with Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf but became disillusioned, especially because he thought it was moving to the right of the political spectrum and was increasingly dominated by the very ruling elite that it had set out to challenge. According to The Times of India, Randhawa says his AAPP \\"lays greater emphasis on national rejuvenation\\" than Mulk's AAP and it has a wider focus on social issues such as poverty.

Twenty five regional commissioning support units submitted outline business plans in 2012 to NHS England which hosted them. The commissioning support units were largely staffed by former employees of primary care trusts. They were intended to provide support to clinical commissioning groups by providing business intelligence, health and clinical procurement services and other back-office administrative functions, including contract management. The plan was to introduce competition into this market by making them independent businesses from 2016. By May 2014 there had been a number of amalgamations as some clinical commissioning groups brought their commissioning support services in-house. Greater East Midlands Commissioning Support Unit was criticised by Liz Kendall MP who said it should no longer run NHS continuing healthcare services for patients with complex needs and that it only had one part-time person monitoring the quality of all its home care providers. It announced plans for a merger with NHS Arden CSU in November 2014. Between them they provide specialist support to 37 clinical commissioning groups. North of England Commissioning Support Unit has expanded some of their services to other areas of the country such as their business intelligence tool RAIDR, which is now deployed in over 20% of GP Practices In England. The South, South West and Central Southern Commissioning Support Units announced in January 2015 that they planned to merge into a new organisation to be called South, Central and West Commissioning Support which will span Sussex, Cornwall, Gloucestershire and Oxfordshire. The CSUs in the North West and in Yorkshire were not admitted to the NHS procurement framework in February 2015 and NHS England announced that they had no future. Services in Greater Manchester were transferred to Greater Manchester Shared Services. On 1 April 2017, NHS South East CSU formed a partnership with NHS North and East London CSU (NEL CSU). Eight organisations were accredited to provide CCGs with support: *NHS North of England CSU; *NHS Arden and Greater East Midlands CSU; *NHS Midlands and Lancashire CSU; *NEL CSU; *NHS South, Central and West CSU; *Capita; *Optum; * eMBED - a consortium of Mouchel, BDO International, Engine and Dr Foster which took 300 staff from the Yorkshire CSU. in 2013/4 NHS England paid £125m for services from the 19 CSUs operational in that year. £602m of their income came from clinical commissioning groups, and £80m from “other sources” such as provider trusts and local councils. A tendering exercise for the services supplied by the Yorkshire and Humber commissioning support unit was delayed in September 2015 because of lack of interest by potential suppliers in the contract, valued at £20 million pa. It appeared that the CCGs were planning to take a lot of the work in house, as the existing contract amounted to £85 million pa.

He was elected in 2014 for the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and defected to the Conservative Party on 24 January 2015. Early life Bashir was born in Pakistan, and moved to Yorkshire aged eight to live with his father who was a mill worker in Bradford. He is a member of the British Ahmedi Pakistani community. Bashir attended Thornton Grammar School before attending the University of Bradford to study chemical engineering. Professional career Bashir is a restaurateur who, prior to becoming politically active, ran two establishments in Bradford and Manchester. Political career After fifteen years as a member of the Conservative Party, Bashir joined UKIP in 2012 and was placed second on the party's list of candidates for the Yorkshire and the Humber region at the 2014 European Parliament election. UKIP topped the regional poll with 31% of the vote, winning three seats, and Bashir was thus elected as one of six MEPs for the region. He was the party's spokesman on communities and on small and medium-sized businesses until his defection to the Conservatives in January 2015. Bashir is a member of the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs, Employment and Industry committees. He is also a member of the inter- parliamentary delegations for Bosnia and Herzegovina and Afghanistan. Bashir is the chairman of the ECR Group's working group on SMEs and also Conservative parliamentary delegation spokesman on SMEs. On 20 February 2016, Bashir announced that he would be supporting the campaign to leave the European Union in the forthcoming EU membership referendum. As of May 2017, Bashir ranked 720 out of 751 MEPs for his participation in roll call votes in the European Parliament. Bashir met with Conservative leader and Prime Minister David Cameron on 23 January 2015 to discuss moving back to the party, and made the move official the following day. Cameron stated that he was \\"absolutely delighted that Bashir had decided to leave Ukip and join the Conservative Party\\". He also stated that Bashir had an \\"inspiring story\\", and that \\"it's another sign that in this great country of ours you can come to Britain without very much and you can be a member of the European parliament, an MP, sit in the cabinet\\". Following his defection to the Conservatives, UKIP alleged that Bashir had failed to attend a meeting on 20 January 2015, three days prior to his defection, to discuss their concerns, pending an investigation, into what they described as \\"a number of extremely serious issues … which include unanswered financial and employment questions\\" and that \\"UKIP MEP Mike Hookem had passed on evidence of Mr Bashir's alleged wrongdoing to West Yorkshire police.\\" More specifically, they alleged interference in a UKIP Keighley candidate selection, immigration offences in his restaurants and financial irregularities with regard to expenses incurred by his European parliamentary political group at the time, the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy. Bashir described the allegations as \\"absurd and made-up\\". Bashir was defended by Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan and by then-Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps, both of whom criticised the allegations by UKIP. Bashir's lawyers wrote to Nigel Farage in April 2015, inviting him to withdraw the claims made about Bashir or face a libel action. As of April 2016, neither such withdrawal nor any libel action had taken place. =2019 Conservative candidacy= Bashir was selected as the Conservative Party candidate in Leeds North East, but he was then suspended from the party on 20 November 2019 because of comments he had made in 2014. Bashir remained on the ballot paper as the Conservative Party candidate and finished second.https://www.leeds.gov.uk/your-council/elections/parliamentary-general- election-results The comments in question were originally while he was a UKIP MEP. During a debate on 11 September 2014 in the European Parliament, Bashir had described British Jews travelling to Israel and returning as \\"brainwashed extremists\\". These comments were widely perceived as anti-Israel and as potentially antisemitic and, when resurfacing (from a Jewish Chronicle exclusive) on 18 November, were condemned by the Board of Deputies on the same day. Bashir apologised for the comments he made. A subsequent enquiry by the Conservative party chairman suspended Amjad Bashir permanently from the Conservative party Awards and nominations In January 2015, Bashir was nominated for the Politician of the Year award at the British Muslim Awards.

Career Tennant studied mathematics, physics, biology, and chemistry at Caius College, Cambridge (1885–89) prior to becoming a theologian. After hearing the 1889 Huxley lectures, Tennant’s interest in religion grew in the 1890s ultimately leading him to prepare for ordination in the Church of England.Mary Frances Thelen (1968) biography in Tennant F.R. (1903) The Sources of Doctrines of the Fall and Original Sin (Schoken: New York); Delton L.

Also, see the website: http://www.bautz.de/bbkl/t/tennant_f_r.shtml While he was ordained he taught science at Newcastle-under-Lyme High School (1891–94), and became a lecturer in Theology and fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge in 1913. As an Anglican theologian, Tennant assimilated much of Huxley’s lectures culminating in the 1901-1902 Hulsean Lecture entitled Origin and Propagation of Sin where he integrated evolutionary ideas into a Christian synthesis.Frederick R. Tennant. 1906. The Origin and Propagation of Sin: Being the Hulsean lectures delivered before the University of Cambridge in 1901-2. 2nd ed. (Cambridge University Press: Cambridge).

The Ministry of Culture of the Republic of China (ROC) established the Taiwan Academy in 2011. History Although the ROC has operated Chinese schools and cultural centers in foreign countries for years, the Taiwan Academies represent more centralized control over cultural diplomacy with the Executive Yuan's Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) joining the Overseas Community Affairs Council, which had traditionally concerned itself only with Overseas Chinese. As a candidate, President Ma Ying-jeou proposed the creation of Taiwan Academies during the 2008 Republic of China presidential election, along with a $150 million fund to create a Nobel Prize in Literature-like award for Chinese people. The Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office opened the first Academies in New York, Los Angeles, and Houston on 14 October 2011. Immediately, the name \\"Taiwan Academy\\" was criticized by legislators from the ruling Kuomintang party as \\"degrading\\" and \\"signifying self-localization\\", as opposed to a name like \\"Zhonghua Academy\\" (), which would emphasize a broader representation of Han Chinese culture. The ROC's Minister of Culture Lung Ying-tai said the Taiwan Academies will neither compete with nor cooperate with mainland China's Confucius Institutes for the time being. The CCA cited the Taiwan Academies as a way of exerting the government's soft power and to provide \\"insights into Chinese culture with Taiwanese features\\". In addition to the three Taiwan Academies established in the United States, the Ministry of Culture has also set up Taiwan Academy contact points in 64 countries as of September 2013. The contact points represent long-term agreements with collaborating educational institutions to assist in the dissemination of information related to the Taiwan Academy and promote programs offered by the Academy. Activities Taiwan Academies have a budget of $21.1 million per year to fund scholarships for Sinology and Taiwan studies, and will also promote academic exchange with foreigners. Taiwan Academies are involved with screening movies from and distributing the Culture Ministry's \\"Taiwan Cinema Toolkit\\", which features subtitled films from Taiwan-origin directors like Ang Lee and Edward Yang.

Early life and career Nathan Gill was born in England, but his family moved to Wales in the early 1980s. He was educated at Ysgol David Hughes and then Coleg Menai: on leaving the latter he joined a family-owned private company based in the East Riding of Yorkshire. He founded and managed Burgill Ltd in March 2004, with his mother Elaine.Companies House records.

The company employed 180 staff, chiefly from central Europe (mainly Poland) and the Philippines, to which they optionally provided chargeable \\"bunkhouse\\"-style accommodation. In a later interview with the Western Mail after his election, Gill commented: The company collapsed into administration with debts of £116,000, after its main bankers HSBC withdrew its borrowing facility, owing to the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Gill then moved back to Wales, where he now lives in Llangefni, Isle of Anglesey, with his American wife Jana, and five children. The family are practising Mormons. Political career In July 2012, he came last in the election of councillor for the Llanbedrgoch electoral division. In May 2013, he led the UKIP group of candidates in the Anglesey local elections, which included his wife, Jana Gill (standing for Canolbarth Môn), and his sister, Jayne Gill (for Aethwy). Gill himself stood to be elected as councillor for the new electoral division of Seiriol, but he came in eighth place with 7% of the vote. The party did not win any seats on the island's council. In August 2013, he came third behind Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth in the National Assembly for Wales by-election for Ynys Môn. With John Bufton stepping down as MEP in 2014, Gill was selected as UKIP candidate number one for Wales in the European Parliament Election and held on to the seat for the party. During the UK Independence Party Wales Conference on 6 December 2014, Nigel Farage, then-Leader of UK Independence Party, announced that Gill would be the Leader of the Party in Wales. During the 2015 general election campaign, Gill represented UKIP in the ITV Welsh TV Leaders debate. During the election campaign, Gill denied human involvement in climate change, comments which were strongly criticised by other leaders. In the 2016 Assembly election Gill won a seat representing the North Wales region. He was beaten to the post of leader of the UKIP group in the National Assembly for Wales by former Conservative MP Neil Hamilton. Farage described the move as an \\"unjust act of deep ingratitude\\" resulting in Hamilton dismissing Farage as simply an \\"MEP for South East England whose opinions were irrelevant\\". Gill subsequently left the UKIP group in the assembly to sit as an independent, citing much infighting and distractions. He remained a member of the party and its leader in Wales, until Neil Hamilton was made Wales leader in September 2016. Also in September 2016 Gill's media advisor Alexandra Phillips spoke to The Guardian, stating that she had left UKIP and joined the Conservatives, making comments critical of Hamilton.Anushka Asthana, Rowena Mason, The Guardian, 16 September 2016, Staying on as an advisor to Gill, she told BBC Wales that UKIP's foothold in Wales had become \\"a war zone\\".UKIP in Wales a war zone, says Nathan Gill adviser BBC News, 16 September 2016; accessed 26 May 2019 Gill resigned as an AM in December 2017.

He was reelected as an MEP in Wales in the 2019 European Parliament election. He was elected alongside fellow Brexit Party candidate, James Wells. Gill ran in Caerphilly in the 2019 general election, and came 4th with 11.2% of the vote.

Early life Wheat was born in Massachusetts to Congregational Church minister Frank Irving Wheat and Catherine Isabel Pearce on December 5, 1892. In 1898 his parents moved the family to San Francisco, then a few years later moved south near Pasadena. Wheat graduated from Pomona College in 1915 and was admitted to Harvard Law School. In 1917 he served as an ambulance driver during the First World War. Discharged from service, he resumed his education, married Helen Millspaugh on September 22, 1919 and took his LL.B. in 1920. Wheat returned to California, where his legal practice centered on public and private utility law. He joined the California Railroad Commission in 1922, eventually becoming its chief counsel. He returned to private practice in San Francisco in 1929, then served on the legal staff of the Federal Communications Commission between 1936 and 1938. Until 1957 when he retired, Wheat interspersed public appointments with private legal activity. California history contributions Wheat was a member of San Francisco's elite Bohemian Club and participated activity in its encampments. He also participated in the resurrection of E Clampus Vitus. Through his social activity he was introduced to Henry R. Wagner, who introduced his friend to history and the California Historical Society. Wheat was editor for the Society's journal between 1927 and 1933, which was the year he moved to Los Angeles. Wheat continued to contribute to the California Historical Society Quarterly with such articles as Pioneer Visitors to Death Valley After the Forty-Niners (September, 1939). While in Los Angeles, Wheat served on the publication committee of the Historical Society of Southern California where he published The Forty-Niners in Death Valley: A Tentative Census (1939). In 1949 he published a bibliography of work on the Gold Rush, Books of the California Gold Rush. Frémont-Gibbs-Smith Map Fremont/Smith/Gibbs map In October 1950, Wheat was elected to membership in the American Antiquarian Society. Around that time, he had begun compiling information for his milestone work: Mapping the Transmississippi West, 1540–1861. In 1953 he rediscovered a copy of the 1847 Frémont map in the collection of the American Geographical Society that bore manuscript emendations by George Gibbs. Gibbs had transferred the data onto the map from an unknown source. The penciled additions showed the travels by western explorer and fur trader Jedediah Smith. Wheat spoke extensively of the map in a paper delivered to the American Antiquarian Society in 1954. With the help of Smith biographer and Bancroft Library historian Dale L. Morgan, Wheat was able to show that the emendations were likely a transcription from a long-lost map by Smith from the late 1820s. The pair released their findings in California Historical Society special publication Jedediah Smith and His Maps of the American West in 1954, the year after Morgan's Jedediah Smith and the Opening of the West (Bobbs-Merrill, 1953) appeared in print. Mapping the Transmississippi West Mapping the Transmississippi West, 1540–1861, appeared in five folio volumes (the last in two parts) between 1957 and 1963. Written with the research and editorial cooperation of Dale Morgan, the volumes describe unfolding geographic knowledge and important maps of the West's exploration and migration, from the Spanish discovery to the opening of the Civil War. Wheat incorporated and financed the Institute for Historical Cartography as the first volume was going to press in an effort to guarantee publication of the massive volumes and to dodge the onus of self publication. Wheat suffered a stroke in June 1955, which delayed production of his historical cartography. He recovered physically, but in August the same year suffered a second stroke which left him only limited use of his right hand. He dictated much of volumes 2–4 to a secretary, correcting proofs left-handed. In May 1961 Wheat suffered a third stroke that completely incapacitated him. Morgan, who had participated as a confidant and editor for most of the work but remained in the background, produced the two-part fifth and concluding volume from Wheat's collection of map, map photostats, notes, and his own massive research files. Carl Wheat suffered a fifth, massive stroke in June 1966 and died at home several weeks later. His papers are archived in the Bancroft Library Honorariums Wheat served as a Trustee of Pomona College and was awarded an honorary degree from that institution in 1959. The same year, he was awarded the Henry R. Wagner Memorial Award from the California Historical Society.

It first appeared on their 1968 album The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society. It was written by the Kinks' principal songwriter, Ray Davies. Background \\"Last of the Steam-Powered Trains\\" was inspired by \\"Smokestack Lightnin'\\", a rhythm and blues track by Howlin' Wolf. The track, first released in 1956, became a standard number for blues bands at the time to perform (including The Kinks). However, as time passed, R&B; began to lose its appeal, with pop music taking over. In \\"Last of the Steam-Powered Trains\\", Davies not only references the blues musically, but acknowledges this situation lyrically. When talking about \\"Last of the Steam-Powered Trains\\", Ray Davies said, \\"Again, like the 'Walter' song it's really about not having anything in common with people. Everybody wanted to know about steam trains a couple of years ago, but they don't any more. It's about me being the last of the renegades. All my friends are middle class now. They've all stopped playing in clubs. They've all made money and have happy faces. Oddly enough, I never did like steam trains much.\\" Recording \\"Last of the Steam-Powered Trains\\" was one of the final tracks recorded for The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, being recorded after the original 12-track version of the album was pulled from shops at Ray Davies's insistence. Also recorded at this point in time was \\"Big Sky\\", the track that followed it on the final 15-track version of The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society. Lyrics and music The lyrics of \\"Last of the Steam Powered Trains\\", the singer takes the role of an antique steam-powered train. The singer calls himself \\"the last of the blood and sweat brigade,\\" \\" the last of the good old renegades,\\" and \\"the last of the good old fashioned steam-powered trains.\\" He says, \\"I don't know where I'm going, or why I came,\\" and that all of his friends are \\"middle class and grey.\\" He \\"live[s] in a museum, so [he's] okay,\\" but then goes on to say, \\"all this peaceful living is drivin' me insane.\\" These lyrics can be taken literally, but they also compare the dwindling popularity of blues with these now obsolete steam-powered trains. Musically, the track is considered one of the more rocking and bluesy tracks on The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society. Andy Miller wrote in his 33 and 1/3 book, The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society, that \\"the track hovers between paying homage to the R&B; sound and spoofing it.\\" It features Ray Davies on vocals, as well as harmonica (which is occasionally double tracked). Midway through the song, the track dramatically speeds up for a short section, featuring a bass line by Pete Quaife described by Miller as \\"Chuck Berry-like.\\" Release and reception \\"Last of the Steam-Powered Trains\\" was first released on The Kinks Are the Village Green Preservation Society. It has since appeared on the 1970 compilation album, The Kinks. It was not released as a single. It was performed (mimed with live vocal) on the BBC2 TV Show 'Once More With Felix' in January 1969, and went on to be a fixture of the groups live act in the late 60s and early 70s. Ray Davies performed the song solo in 2011 as part of his Meltdown presentation on the full VGPS album. \\"Last of the Steam-Powered Trains\\" has generally received positive reviews from critics. AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that \\"the bluesy shuffle of 'Last of the Steam-Powered Trains' is the closest [The Kinks are the Village Green Preservation Society] comes to rock & roll.\\" Robert Christgau, in his review of The Kinks Are The Village Green Preservation Society, said, \\"the album's most memorable song--it would be the single were there enough demand--is probably \\"Last of the Steam Powered Trains.\\" Like the title song and about half the others, it is a song about the past—or rather, about how to deal with the past. It is possible to see the country-western thing here in the same perspective.\\" Rolling Stone's Paul Williams said, \\"The song is completely itself, but you can't overlook even on the first hearing the fact that it's Howling Wolf's 'Smokestack Lightning.' And that makes me smile, good old Kinks, finally recording 'Smokestack Lightning,' and a good job of it too. A little fancy kineticism in the break, harmonica and bass and lead buildup, just so you know all the old tricks are as relevant to their music as any new tricks they might enjoy could be. They even throw on a \\"Till the End of the Day\\" ending, and that's not the second time they've done that. Might be the fifth.\\" References Category:1968 songs Category:Songs written by Ray Davies Category:The Kinks songs Category:Song recordings produced by Ray Davies Category:Songs about trains Category:Rhythm and blues songs Category:Blues rock songs ","title":"Last of the Steam-Powered Trains"},{"id":"42863440","text":"Pulse Polio Day, a child swallows vaccine drops and is marked as vaccinated (felt-nib pen on finger).

In the May 2014 elections for the European Parliament, she was elected as an MEP in South West England, being the lead candidate on the Labour list. On 1 July 2014, the start of her mandate, she was appointed a full member of the Parliament's Committee on Budgets. Moody supported the Remain platform in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, and afterward argued against a United Kingdom invocation of Article 50 to start the EU withdrawal process in 2016 or 2017, in order to allow more negotiating time. In June 2016, she called for Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn to stand down as part of the 2016 leadership challenge.

Woolfe was born in Moss Side in Manchester and studied law at Aberystwyth University, after which he worked as a barrister and a general counsel. He was elected to UKIP's National Executive Committee (NEC) in 2011 and was elected at the 2014 European Parliament election. He later contested Stockport as the UKIP candidate at the 2015 general election. Woolfe was considered a frontrunner in UKIP's September 2016 leadership election but was excluded from the race after submitting his nomination late. After Diane James resigned from the party leadership, he stood in the second UKIP leadership election of 2016 but withdrew after he was allegedly injured during an altercation with a fellow UKIP MEP. He resigned from UKIP in October 2016. Early life and education Woolfe, the eldest of a family of four, was born in Moss Side, in Manchester, and grew up in the Manchester suburb of Burnage. His younger half-brother is Nathan Woolfe, a footballer who has played for various clubs as a striker. Both his parents were born in Manchester: his mother to an Irish mother, and his English father to a British Jewish mother and a Black American father. Woolfe was educated at St Bernard's Roman Catholic Primary School, a voluntary-aided state-maintained school in Burnage, followed by St Bede's College, a co-educational independent school in the Manchester suburb of Whalley Range, to which he won a scholarship. He studied law at Aberystwyth University graduating with a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree in 1990. He pursued further studies at the Inns of Court School of Law in London, before being called to the Bar. Professional career Woolfe completed his BPTC (Bar Professional Training Course) with City Law School and was called to the Bar at the Honourable Society of the Inner Temple. However, Woolfe failed to secure pupillage and therefore was unable to practise as a Barrister. He spent several years as general counsel for hedge fund managers. He now also acts as a legal and regulatory consultant to financial institutions. Political career Woolfe was introduced to UKIP by Lord Pearson of Rannoch and made his debut speech at UKIP's 2010 annual conference in Torquay. After Nigel Farage declared his intention to stand in the 2010 UKIP leadership election, he appointed Woolfe to his team of senior spokespeople, becoming UKIP Economics spokesman. In 2011, Woolfe was elected to UKIP's National Executive Committee, coming second behind Neil Hamilton who topped the poll. Woolfe stood as a UKIP candidate for the City and East for the Greater London Authority in May 2012, coming seventh with 3.1% of the vote. On 8 May 2014, Woolfe chaired a UKIP public meeting in Westminster promoting UKIP's Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) candidates; his responsibilities include being UKIP Spokesman for migration policy. Woolfe has called for a fair and ethical stance towards migration, stressing that migration should be based on merit, not on race, religion, colour or creed. Woolfe was selected as number 3 on UKIP's regional party list in the 2014 European Parliament election in North West England. He was one of three candidates from the party to be elected as MEP in the region. From July 2014 until May 2015, Woolfe's Economics brief was shared with Patrick O'Flynn. O'Flynn was responsible for macro policy and taxation, while Woolfe remained UKIP's Financial Affairs and City of London spokesman. Woolfe advocates a simplified and lower tax regime for all, believing that the middle classes have been squeezed with the 40% tax band and has called for the 45% tax band to be abolished and replaced with a higher threshold for 40% band at £45,000. He has also echoed calls made by UKIP Leader Nigel Farage to take those on minimum wage out of paying tax altogether. On 4 September 2014, Woolfe was chosen as UKIP's Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Stockport. Woolfe came third at the 2015 general election with 13% of the vote. =Police and Crime Commissioner elections= In November 2012, Woolfe won UKIP's nomination to contest the Greater Manchester Police and Crime Commissioner elections. Woolfe's campaign message was one of tough on crime and the support of community policing. He finished fifth, polling 23,256 votes (8.55%). It emerged in August 2016 he had a conviction from 14 years earlier for being drunk while in charge of a scooter (he was not riding it at the time) when running in the 2012 PCC elections and admitted he broke electoral rules in failing to declare it. He said that he \\"forgot about the conviction\\" for which he had received a £350 fine. =UKIP leadership bid= In July 2016, Woolfe launched his bid to become leader of UKIP following the resignation of Nigel Farage. He gained the support of the leaders of UKIP in Wales, Scotland and London. His running-mate was Welsh UKIP leader Nathan Gill. Woolfe promised to 'ruthlessly' go after Labour seats in Northern England and the Midlands. Woolfe said UKIP has \\"won the argument\\" for managed immigration and promised to drive a new focus on social mobility. Furthermore, Woolfe also said he would build on the 4 million votes UKIP got at the last election. =Membership lapse and leadership application= Woolfe let his UKIP membership lapse from December 2014, and paid for it to be renewed in March 2016. On 31 July 2016, he was blocked by the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) from submitting his leadership, claiming that his application had been submitted several minutes after the deadline. Woolfe denied this, and said UKIP's computer systems were unable to accept his application at the time of submission. He had previously talked of scrapping the NEC. =Possible defection to Conservative Party= On 5 October 2016, Woolfe was reported saying he was \\"enthused\\" by Theresa May's leadership, and that he had considered defecting to the Conservative Party. Meanwhile, eighteen days after Diane James was elected as UKIP leader, she resigned. Woolfe said he would stand for the UKIP leadership. =Altercation with MEP Mike Hookem= On 6 October 2016, Woolfe was hospitalised at the European Parliament building in Strasbourg, after a reported row with fellow MEP and UKIP Defence Spokesman Mike Hookem. Hookem later denied the assertion that he had punched Woolfe. Hookem said Woolfe \\"took exception\\" to his comment about Woolfe turning his leadership application paperwork in late. After the incident, the interim Leader of UKIP, Nigel Farage, said \\"You see third world parliaments where this sort of thing happens. It's not good\\". On the same day, Arron Banks, a major donor to UKIP, who had previously said that UKIP would be \\"dead in the water\\" if Diane James did not become leader, said that he would leave UKIP if Woolfe were prevented from running for leader, and if two other senior members remained in the party: \\"If Neil Hamilton and Douglas Carswell [UKIP's (then) only MP] remain in the party, and the NEC decide that Steven Woolfe cannot run for leader, I will be leaving Ukip\\". On 7 October 2016, Woolfe was reported to have offered the \\"hand of friendship\\" to Mike Hookem; he also told the media that his injuries \\"proved\\" that he had been attacked by Hookem. Woolfe subsequently withdrew from the contest and resigned from UKIP in October 2016, describing the party as \\"ungovernable\\". =Brexit Party= On 8 February 2019 on BBC Newsnight, Woolfe stated that he would stand for the Brexit Party in the event that Britain had not left the European Union before the May 2019 UK EU elections. He was not, however, among the Brexit Party candidates who stood for election on 23 May. Personal life Woolfe was married to Fiona, with whom he has a daughter. They lived on Victoria Road, Chester, until mid-2016, when they moved to Winchester. They have since divorced. Woolfe is a Catholic.

The history of universities in Scotland includes the development of all universities and university colleges in Scotland, between their foundation between the fifteenth century and the present day. Until the fifteenth century, those Scots who wished to attend university had to travel to England, or to the Continent. This situation was transformed by the founding of St John's College, St Andrews in 1418 by Henry Wardlaw, bishop of St. Andrews. St Salvator's College was added to St. Andrews in 1450. The other great bishoprics followed, with the University of Glasgow being founded in 1451 and King's College, Aberdeen in 1495. Initially, these institutions were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen. International contacts helped integrate Scotland into a wider European scholarly world and would be one of the most important ways in which the new ideas of humanism were brought into Scottish intellectual life in the sixteenth century. St Leonard's College was founded in St Andrews in 1512 and St John's College as St Mary's College, St Andrews was re-founded in 1538, as a humanist academy for the training of clerics. Public lectures that were established in Edinburgh in the 1540s would eventually become the University of Edinburgh in 1582. After the Reformation, Scotland's universities underwent reforms associated with Andrew Melville, who was influenced by the anti- Aristotelian Petrus Ramus. In 1617 James IV decreed that the town college of Edinburgh should be known as King James's College. In 1641, the two colleges at Aberdeen were united by decree of Charles I (r. 1625–49), to form the \\"King Charles University of Aberdeen\\". Under the Commonwealth (1652–60), the universities saw an improvement in their funding. After the Restoration there was a purge of Presbyterians from the universities, but most of the intellectual advances of the preceding period were preserved. The colleges at St. Andrews were demerged. The five Scottish university colleges recovered from the disruption of the civil war years and Restoration with a lecture- based curriculum that was able to embrace economics and science, offering a high-quality liberal education to the sons of the nobility and gentry. In the eighteenth century the universities went from being small and parochial institutions, largely for the training of clergy and lawyers, to major intellectual centres at the forefront of Scottish identity and life, seen as fundamental to democratic principles and the opportunity for social advancement for the talented. Chairs of medicine were founded at all the university towns. By the 1740s Edinburgh medical school was the major centre of medicine in Europe and was a leading centre in the Atlantic world. Access to Scottish universities was probably more open than in contemporary England, Germany or France. Attendance was less expensive and the student body more representative of society as a whole. The system was flexible and the curriculum became a modern philosophical and scientific one, in keeping with contemporary needs for improvement and progress. Scotland reaped the intellectual benefits of this system in its contribution to the European Enlightenment. Many of the key figures of the Scottish Enlightenment were university professors, who developed their ideas in university lectures. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Scotland's five university colleges had no entrance exam, students typically entered at ages of 15 or 16, attended for as little as two years, chose which lectures to attend and left without qualifications. The curriculum was dominated by divinity and the law and there was a concerted attempt to modernise the curriculum, particularly by introducing degrees in the physical sciences and the need to reform the system to meet the needs of the emerging middle classes and the professions. The result of these reforms was a revitalisation of the Scottish university system, which expanded to 6,254 students by the end of the century and produced leading figures in both the arts and sciences. In the first half of the twentieth century Scottish universities fell behind those in England and Europe in terms of participation and investment. After the Robbins Report of 1963 there was a rapid expansion in higher education in Scotland. By the end of the decade the number of Scottish Universities had doubled. New universities included the University of Dundee, Strathclyde, Heriot-Watt, Stirling. From the 1970s the government preferred to expand higher education in the non-university sector and by the late 1980s roughly half of students in higher education were in colleges. In 1992, under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, the distinction between universities and colleges was removed, creating new universities at Abertay, Glasgow Caledonian, Napier, Paisley and Robert Gordon. History =Middle Ages= Background John Mair, one of the most successful products of the Medieval Scottish educational system From the end of the eleventh century, universities had been founded across Europe, developing as semi-autonomous centres of learning, often teaching theology, mathematics, law and medicine.I. Wei, \\"The rise of universities\\" in A. MacKay, ed., Atlas of Medieval Europe (London: Routledge, 1997), , pp. 241–3. Until the fifteenth century, those Scots who wished to attend university had to travel to England, to Oxford or Cambridge, or to the Continent. Just over 1,000 students have been identified as doing so between the twelfth century and 1410. Among the destinations Paris was the most important, but also Cologne, Orléans, Wittenberg, Louvain and Vienna.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 68–72. Among these travelling scholars, the most important intellectual figure was John Duns Scotus (c. 1266–1308), who studied at Oxford, Cambridge and Paris. He probably died at Cologne in 1308, after becoming a major influence on late medieval religious thought.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (St. Martin's Press, 1997), , p. 119. After the outbreak of the Wars of Independence (1296–1357), with occasional exceptions under safe conduct, English universities were closed to Scots and continental universities became more significant.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 124–5. Some Scottish scholars became teachers in continental universities. At Paris, this included John de Rait (died c. 1355) and Walter Wardlaw (died c. 1387) in the 1340s and 1350s, William de Tredbrum in the 1380s and Laurence de Lindores (1372–1437) in the early 1500s. The continued movement to other universities produced a school of Scottish nominalists at Paris in the early sixteenth century, of which John Mair (1467–1550) was the most important figure. He had probably studied at a Scottish grammar school and then Cambridge, before moving to Paris where he matriculated in 1493. First Scottish universities Bust of Bishop Henry Wardlaw, founder of St. Andrews University This situation was transformed by the founding of St John's College, St Andrews in 1418. Henry Wardlaw, bishop of St. Andrews, petitioned the anti-Pope Benedict XIII during the later stages of the Great Western Schism, when Scotland was one of his few remaining supporters. Wardlaw argued that Scottish scholars in other universities were being persecuted for their loyalty to the anti-Pope.P. Daileader, \\"Local experiences of the Great Western Schism\\", in J. Rollo-Koster and T. M. Izbicki, eds, A Companion to the Great Western Schism (1378–1417) (BRILL, 2009), , p. 119. St Salvator's College was added to St. Andrews in 1450. The other great bishoprics followed, with the University of Glasgow being founded in 1451 and King's College, Aberdeen in 1495. Both were also papal foundations, by Nicholas V and Alexander VI respectively.J. Durkan, \\"Universities: to 1720\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 610–12. St. Andrews was deliberately modelled on Paris, and although Glasgow adopted the statues of the University of Bologna, there, like Aberdeen, there was an increasing Parisian influence, partly because all its early regents had been educated in Paris.A. Broadie, A History of Scottish Philosophy (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2009), , p. 34. Initially, these institutions were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen who began to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative posts in government and law. They provided only basic degrees. Those wanting to study for the more advanced degrees that were common amongst European scholars still needed to go to universities in other countries. As a result, Scottish scholars continued to visit the Continent and returned to English universities after they reopened to Scots in the late fifteenth century. By the fifteenth century, beginning in northern Italy, universities had become strongly influenced by humanist thinking. This put an emphasis on classical authors, questioning some of the accepted certainties of established thinking and manifesting itself in the teaching of new subjects, particularly through the medium of the Greek language.W. Rüegg, \\"The rise of Humanism\\", in Hilde de Ridder-Symoens, ed., A History of the University in Europe: Volume 1, Universities in the Middle Ages (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), , pp. 452–9. However, in this period, Scottish universities largely had a Latin curriculum, designed for the clergy, civil and common lawyers. They did not teach the Greek that was fundamental to the new humanist scholarship, focusing on metaphysics and putting a largely unquestioning faith in the works of Aristotle, whose authority would be challenged in the Renaissance.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 183–4. Towards the end of the fifteenth century, a humanist influence was becoming more evident. A major figure was Archibald Whitelaw, a teacher at St. Andrews and Cologne who later became a tutor to the young James III and served as royal secretary from 1462 to 1493.A. Thomas, \\"The Renaissance\\", in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , pp. 196–7. By 1497, the humanist and historian Hector Boece, born in Dundee and who had studied at Paris, returned to become the first principal at the new university of Aberdeen. In 1518 Mair returned to Scotland to become principal of the University of Glasgow. He transferred to St. Andrews in 1523 and in 1533 he was made Provost of St Salvator's College. While in Scotland his students included John Knox and George Buchanan.A. Broadie, The Tradition of Scottish Philosophy: A New Perspective on the Enlightenment (Rowman & Littlefield, 1990), , p. 23. These international contacts helped integrate Scotland into a wider European scholarly world and would be one of the most important ways in which the new ideas of humanism were brought into Scottish intellectual life in the sixteenth century. =Early modern era= Renaissance Andrew Melville, credited with major reforms in Scottish Universities in the sixteenth century The civic values of humanism, which stressed the importance of order and morality, began to have a major impact on education and would become dominant in universities and schools by the end of the sixteenth century.J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488–1587 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , pp. 340–1. By 1497 the humanist and historian Hector Boece, born in Dundee and who had studied at Paris, returned to become the first principal at the new university of Aberdeen. Another major figure was Archibald Whitelaw, a teacher at St. Andrews and Cologne who later became a tutor to the young James III and served as royal secretary from 1462 to 1493. King's College Aberdeen was refounded in 1515. In addition to the basic arts curriculum it offered theology, civil and canon law and medicine.J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488–1587 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 55. St Leonard's College was founded in Aberdeen in 1511 by Archbishop Alexander Stewart. John Douglas led the refoundation of St John's College as St Mary's College, St Andrews in 1538, as a humanist academy for the training of clerics, with a stress on biblical study.J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488–1587 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 187. Robert Reid, Abbot of Kinloss and later Bishop of Orkney, was responsible in the 1520s and 1530s for bringing the Italian humanist Giovanni Ferrario to teach at Kinloss Abbey, where he established an impressive library and wrote works of Scottish history and biography. Reid was also instrumental in organising the public lectures that were established in Edinburgh in the 1540s on law, Greek, Latin and philosophy, under the patronage of the queen consort Mary of Guise. These developed into the \\"Tounis College\\" of the city, which would eventually become the University of Edinburgh. Reformation In the mid-sixteenth century, Scotland underwent a Protestant Reformation that rejected Papal authority and many aspects of Catholic theology and practice. It created a predominately Calvinist national church, known as the kirk, which was strongly Presbyterian in outlook, severely reducing the powers of bishops, although not initially abolishing them.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 102–4. After the Reformation, Scotland's universities underwent a series of reforms associated with Andrew Melville, who returned from Geneva to become principal of the University of Glasgow in 1574. A distinguished linguist, philosopher and poet, he had trained in Paris and studied law at Poitiers, before moving to Geneva and developing an interest in Protestant theology. Influenced by the anti- Aristotelian Petrus Ramus, he placed an emphasis on simplified logic and elevated languages and sciences to the same status as philosophy, allowing accepted ideas in all areas to be challenged. He introduced new specialist teaching staff, replacing the system of \\"regenting\\", where one tutor took the students through the entire arts curriculum.J. Kirk, \\"'Melvillian reform' and the Scottish universities\\", in A. A. MacDonald and M. Lynch, eds, The Renaissance in Scotland: Studies in Literature, Religion, History, and Culture Offered to John Durkhan (BRILL, 1994), , p. 280. Metaphysics were abandoned and Greek became compulsory in the first year followed by Aramaic, Syriac and Hebrew, launching a new fashion for ancient and biblical languages. Enrollment rates at the University of Glasgow had been declining before his arrival, but students now began to arrive in large numbers. He assisted in the reconstruction of Marischal College, Aberdeen, founded as a second university college in the city in 1593 by George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal, and, to do for St Andrews what he had done for Glasgow, he was appointed Principal of St Mary's College, St Andrews in 1580. The \\"Tounis College\\" established in the mid-sixteenth century became the University of Edinburgh in 1582. Melville's reforms produced a revitalisation of all Scottish universities, which were now providing a quality of education equal to the most esteemed higher education institutions anywhere in Europe. Seventeenth century The High Street college of the University of Glasgow, completed under the Commonwealth King James IV's major contribution to the universities was to combat militant Presbyterianism by insisting that the catechism God and the King must be read in the schools and universities. He also decreed, in 1617, that the town college of Edinburgh should be known as King James's College.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470–1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , p. 185. In 1641, the two colleges at Aberdeen were united by decree of Charles I (r. 1625–49), to form the \\"King Charles University of Aberdeen\\".D. Ditchburn, \\"Educating the Elite: Aberdeen and Its Universities”, in E. P. Dennison, D. Ditchburn and M. Lynch, eds, Aberdeen Before 1800: A New History (Dundurn, 2002), , p. 332. Under the Commonwealth (1652–60), the universities saw an improvement in their funding, as they were given income from deaneries, defunct bishoprics and the excise, allowing the completion of buildings including the college in the High Street in Glasgow. They were still largely seen as training schools for clergy, and came under the control of the hard line Protesters, who were generally favoured by the regime because of their greater antipathy to royalism, with leading protester Patrick Gillespie being made Principal at Glasgow in 1652.J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 1991), , pp. 227–8. After the Restoration there was a purge of Presbyterians from the universities, but most of the intellectual advances of the preceding period were preserved.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (Random House, 2011), , p. 262. There was considerable mistrust between the two colleges in Aberdeen, which was sufficient to produce an armed riot over the poaching of students in 1659. The two institutions were formally demerged by the Rescissory Act 1661. The five Scottish university colleges recovered from the disruption of the civil war years and Restoration with a lecture-based curriculum that was able to embrace economics and science, offering a high-quality liberal education to the sons of the nobility and gentry.R. Anderson, \\"The history of Scottish Education pre-1980\\", in T. G. K. Bryce and W. M. Humes, eds, Scottish Education: Post-Devolution (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 2003), , pp. 219–28. All saw the establishment or re-establishment of chairs of mathematics. The first was at Marshall College in 1613. A university chair was added at St. Andrews in 1668, at Edinburgh in 1674 and at Glasgow in 1691. The chair at Glasgow was first taken by the polymath George Sinclair, who had been deposed from his position in philosophy for his Presbyterianism in 1666, but was able to return after the Glorious Revolution marked a move against episcopalianism. A further chair would be added at King's College Aberdeen in 1703.P. Wood, \\"Science in the Scottish Enlightenment\\", in A. Broadie, ed., The Cambridge Companion to the Scottish Enlightenment (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), , p. 99. Astronomy was facilitated by the building of observatories at St. Andrews (c. 1677) and at King's College (1675) and Marischal College (1694) in Aberdeen. Robert Sibbald was appointed as the first Professor of Medicine at Edinburgh and he co-founded the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh in 1681.T. M. Devine, \\"The rise and fall of the Scottish Enlightenment\\", in T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 373. These developments helped the universities to become major centres of medical education and would put Scotland at the forefront of Enlightenment thinking. =Modern era= Eighteenth century Old College, University of Edinburgh, built to plans drawn up by Robert Adam and completed in the nineteenth century In the eighteenth century the universities went from being small and parochial institutions, largely for the training of clergy and lawyers, to major intellectual centres at the forefront of Scottish identity and life, seen as fundamental to democratic principles and the opportunity for social advancement for the talented. Chairs of medicine were founded at Marsichial College (1700), Glasgow (1713), St. Andrews (1722) and a chair of chemistry and medicine at Edinburgh (1713). It was Edinburgh's medical school, founded in 1732, that came to dominate. By the 1740s it had displaced Leiden as the major centre of medicine in Europe and was a leading centre in the Atlantic world.P. Wood, \\"Science in the Scottish Enlightenment\\", in A. Broadie, ed., The Cambridge Companion to the Scottish Enlightenment (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), , p. 100. The universities still had their difficulties. The economic down turn in the mid-century forced the closure of St Leonard's College in St Andrews, whose properties and staff were merged into St Salvator's College to form the United College of St Salvator and St Leonard. Access to Scottish universities was probably more socially open than in contemporary England, Germany or France. Attendance was less expensive and the student body more representative of society as a whole.R. A. Houston, Scottish Literacy and the Scottish Identity: Illiteracy and Society in Scotland and Northern England, 1600–1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), , p. 245. Humbler students were aided by a system of bursaries established for the training of the clergy. In this period residence became divorced from the colleges and students were able to live much more cheaply and largely unsupervised, at home, with friends or in lodgings in the university towns. The system was flexible and the curriculum became a modern philosophical and scientific one, in keeping with contemporary needs for improvement and progress. Scotland reaped the intellectual benefits of this system in its contribution to the European Enlightenment.A. Herman, How the Scots Invented the Modern World (London: Crown Publishing Group, 2001), . Hugh Blair, Professor of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at the University of Edinburgh Many of the key figures of the Scottish Enlightenment were university professors, who developed their ideas in university lectures. The first major philosopher of the Scottish Enlightenment was Francis Hutcheson (1694–1746), who held the Chair of Philosophy at the University of Glasgow from 1729 to 1746. He was a moral philosopher who produced alternatives to the ideas of Thomas Hobbes. One of his major contributions to world thought was the utilitarian and consequentialist principle that virtue is that which provides, \\"the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers\\". Much of what is incorporated in the scientific method (the nature of knowledge, evidence, experience, and causation) and some modern attitudes towards the relationship between science and religion were developed by his protégés David Hume (1711–76) and Adam Smith (1723–90).. Hugh Blair (1718–1800) was a minister of the Church of Scotland and held the Chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres at the University of Edinburgh. He produced an edition of the works of Shakespeare and is best known for Sermons (1777–1801), a five-volume endorsement of practical Christian morality, and Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres (1783), an essay on literary composition, which was to have a major impact on the work of Adam Smith. He was also one of the figures who first drew the Ossian cycle of James Macpherson to public attention.G. A. Kennedy, Classical Rhetoric and Its Christian and Secular Tradition Form Ancient to Modern Times (University of North Carolina Press, 1999), , p. 282. Hume became a major figure in the sceptical philosophical and empiricist traditions of philosophy. His scepticism prevented him from obtaining chairs at Glasgow and Edinburgh. He and other Scottish Enlightenment thinkers developed what he called a 'science of man',. which was expressed historically in works by authors including James Burnett, Adam Ferguson, John Millar and William Robertson, all of whom merged a scientific study of how humans behave in ancient and primitive cultures with a strong awareness of the determining forces of modernity. Indeed, modern sociology largely originated from this movement.A. Swingewood, \\"Origins of Sociology: the Case of the Scottish Enlightenment\\", The British Journal of Sociology, vol. 21, no. 2 (June 1970), pp. 164–80 in JSTOR. Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations (1776) is considered to be the first work of modern economics. It had an immediate impact on British economic policy and still frames twenty-first century discussions on globalisation and tariffs.M. Fry, Adam Smith's Legacy: His Place in the Development of Modern Economics (London: Routledge, 1992), . The focus of the Scottish Enlightenment ranged from intellectual and economic matters to the specifically scientific as in the work of William Cullen, physician and chemist, James Anderson, an agronomist, Joseph Black, physicist and chemist, and James Hutton, the first modern geologist.J. Repcheck, The Man Who Found Time: James Hutton and the Discovery of the Earth's Antiquity (Cambridge, MA: Basic Books, 2003), , pp. 117–43. Nineteenth century Marischal College with the new front under construction; c. 1900 At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Scotland's five university colleges had about 3,000 students between them. They had no entrance exam, students typically entered at ages of 15 or 16, attended for as little as two years, chose which lectures to attend and left without qualifications. Although Scottish universities had gained a formidable reputation in the eighteenth century, the curriculum was dominated by divinity and the law and there was a concerted attempt to modernise the curriculum, particularly by introducing degrees in the physical sciences and the need to reform the system to meet the needs of the emerging middle classes and the professions. The result was two commissions of inquiry in 1826 and 1876 and reforming acts of parliament in 1858 and 1889. The curriculum and system of graduation were reformed. Entrance examinations that were equivalent to the School Leaving Certificate were introduced and average ages of entry rose to 17 or 18. Standard patterns of graduation in the arts curriculum offered three-year ordinary and four-year honours degrees.R. Anderson, \\"The history of Scottish education pre-1980\\", in T. G. K. Bryce and W. M. Humes, eds, Scottish Education: Post-Devolution (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 2003), , p. 224. There was resistance among professors, particularly among chairs of divinity and classics, to the introduction of new subjects, especially the physical sciences. The crown established Regius chairs, all in the sciences, including medicine, chemistry, natural history and botany. The chair of Engineering at Glasgow was the first of its kind in the world. By the 1870s the physical sciences were well established in Scottish universities, whereas in England the battle to modernise the curriculum would not be complete until the end of the century.O. Checkland and S. G. Checkland, Industry and Ethos: Scotland, 1832–1914 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , pp. 147–50. The new separate science faculties were able to move away from the compulsory Latin, Greek and philosophy of the old MA curriculum. Under the commissions, all the universities were restructured. They were given Courts, which included external members and who oversaw the finances of the institution. Students' Representative Councils were founded in 1884 and ratified under the 1889 act. Under this act new arts subjects were established, with chairs in Modern History, French, German and Political Economy. The new buildings of the University of Glasgow at Gilmorehill, c. 1895 The University of St Andrews was at a low point in its fortunes in the early part of the century. It was restructured by commissioners appointed under the 1858 act and began a revival. It pioneered the admission of women to Scottish universities, creating the Lady Literate in Arts (LLA) in 1882, which proved highly popular. From 1892 Scottish universities could all admit and graduate women, with St Andrews the first to do so, and the numbers of women at Scottish universities steadily increased from this point until the early twentieth century.M. F. Rayner-Canham and G. Rayner-Canham, Chemistry was Their Life: Pioneering British Women Chemists, 1880–1949 (London: Imperial College Press, 2008), , p. 264. A new college of St Andrews was opened in the thriving burgh of Dundee in 1883, allowing the university to teach sciences and open a medical school.R. D. Anderson, \\"Universities: 2. 1720–1960\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 612–14. The University of Glasgow became a leader in British higher education by providing the educational needs of youth from the urban and commercial classes.P. L.

It moved from the city centre to a new set of grand neo-Gothic buildings, paid for largely by public subscription, at Gilmorehill in 1870.T. M. Devine, Glasgow: 1830 to 1912 (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1996), , p. 249. The two colleges at Aberdeen were considered too small to be viable and they were restructured as the University of Aberdeen in 1860. Marischal College was rebuilt in the Gothic style from 1900. Unlike the other Medieval and ecclesiastical foundations, because the University of Edinburgh was a civic college it was relatively poor. In 1858 it was taken out of the care of the city and established on a similar basis to the other ancient universities. Lord Kelvin by Hubert von Herkomer The result of these reforms was a revitalisation of the Scottish university system, which expanded to 6,254 students by the end of the century and produced leading figures in both the arts and sciences. The chair of Engineering at Glasgow became highly distinguished under its second incumbent William John Macquorn Rankine (1820–72), who held the position from 1859 to 1872 and became the leading figure in heat engines and founder president of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland. Thomas Thomson (1773–1852) was the first Professor of Chemistry at Glasgow and in 1831 founded the Shuttle Street laboratories, perhaps the first of their kind in the world. His students founded practical chemistry at Aberdeen soon after. William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin was appointed to the chair of natural philosophy at Glasgow aged only 22. His work included the mathematical analysis of electricity and formulation of the first and second laws of thermodynamics. By 1870 Kelvin and Rankine had made Glasgow the leading centre of science and engineering education and investigation in Britain. At Edinburgh, major figures included David Brewster (1781–1868), who made contributions to the science of optics and to the development of photography. Fleeming Jenkin (1833–85) was the first professor of engineering at the university and among wide interests helped develop ocean telegraphs and mechanical drawing. In medicine Joseph Lister (1827–1912) and his student William Macewen (1848–1924), pioneered antiseptic surgery.O. Checkland and S. G. Checkland, Industry and Ethos: Scotland, 1832–1914 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , p. 151. The University of Edinburgh was also a major supplier of surgeons for the Royal Navy, and Robert Jameson (1774–1854), Professor of Natural History at Edinburgh, ensured that a large number of these were surgeon-naturalists, who were vital in the Humboldtian and imperial enterprise of investigating nature throughout the world.J. L. Heilbron, The Oxford Companion To the History of Modern Science (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003), , p. 386.J. Browne, \\"A science of empire: British biogeography before Darwin\\", Revue d'histoire des Sciences, vol. 45 (1992), p. 457. Major figures to emerge from Scottish universities in the science of humanity included the philosopher Edward Caird (1835–1908), the anthropologist James George Frazer (1854–1941) and the sociologist and urban planner Patrick Geddes (1854–1932).O. Checkland and S. G. Checkland, Industry and Ethos: Scotland, 1832–1914 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , p. 152-4. Twentieth century to the present The purpose-built modern buildings of the University of Stirling From 1901 large numbers of students received bursaries from the Carnegie Trust. By 1913 there were 7,776 students in Scottish universities. Of these 1,751 (23 per cent) were women. By the mid-1920s it had risen to a third. It then fell to 25–7 per cent in the 1930s as opportunities in school teaching, virtually the only careers outlet for female graduates in arts and sciences, decreased. No woman was appointed to a Scottish professorship until after 1945. The fall in numbers was most acute among women students, but it was part of a general trend. In the first half of the twentieth century Scottish universities fell behind those in England and Europe in terms of participation and investment. The decline of traditional industries between the wars undermined recruitment to subjects in which Scotland had been traditionally strong, such as science and engineering. English universities increased the numbers of students registered between 1924 and 1927 by 19 per cent, but in Scotland the number of full-time students fell from 10,400 in 1924 to 9,900 in 1937. In the same period, while expenditure in English universities rose by 90 per cent, in Scotland the increase was less than a third of that figure.C. Harvie, No Gods and Precious Few Heroes: Twentieth-Century Scotland (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 3rd edn., 1998), , pp. 78–9. Before the First World War relationships between male and female students tended to be very formal, but in the inter-war years there was an increase in social activities, such as dance halls, cinemas, cafes and public houses. From the 1920s much drunken and high spirited activity was diverted into the annual charity gala or rag. Male centred activities included the Student's Union, Rugby Club and Officers' Training Corps. Women had their own unions and athletics clubs. Universities remained largely non-residential, although a few women's halls of residence were created, most not owned by the universities. The student library at Abertay University After the Robbins Report of 1963 there was a rapid expansion in higher education in Scotland. By the end of the decade the number of Scottish Universities had doubled. The University of Dundee was demerged from St. Andrews, Strathclyde and Heriot- Watt developing from technical colleges and the Stirling was begun as a completely new university on a greenfield site in 1966. From the 1970s the government preferred to expand higher education in the non-university sector of educational and technical colleges, which were cheaper because they undertook little research. By the late 1980s roughly half of students in higher education were in colleges. In 1992, under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, the distinction between universities and colleges was removed.L. Paterson, \\"Universities: 3. post-Robbins\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 614–5. This created new universities at Abertay, Glasgow Caledonian, Napier, Paisley and Robert Gordon.R. Shaw, \\"Institutional and curricular structures in the universities of Scotland\\" in T. G. K. Bryce and W. M. Humes, eds, Scottish Education: Post-Devolution (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 2003), , pp. 664–5. Despite the expansion the number of male students experienced a downturn in growth from 1971 to 1990. The growth in female student numbers was much larger and continued until, by 1999 and 2000, the numbers of women students exceeded male students for the first time.C. G. Brown, \\"Chapter 1- Charting Everyday Experience\\", in L. Abrams and C. G. Brown, eds, A History of Everyday Life in Twentieth-Century Scotland (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), p. 28. After devolution, in 1999 the new Scottish Executive set up an Education Department and an Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department, which together took over its functions.J. Fairley, \\"The Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Department and the Scottish Parliament\\", in T. G. K. Bryce and W. M. Humes, eds, Scottish Education: Post-Devolution (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 2003), , pp. 132–40. One of the major diversions from practice in England, possible because of devolution, was the abolition of student tuition fees in 1999, instead retaining a system of means-tested student grants.D. Cauldwell, \\"Scottish Higher Education: Character and Provision\\", in T. G. K. Bryce and W. M. Humes, eds, Scottish Education: Post- Devolution (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd edn., 2003), , pp. 62–73. In 2001 the University of the Highlands and Islands was created by a federation of 13 colleges and research institutions in the Highlands and Islands in 2001 and which gained full university status in 2011. In 2008–09, approximately 231,000 students studied at universities or institutes of higher education in Scotland, of which 56 per cent were female and 44 per cent male.Scottish Government, Statistics Publication Notice Lifelong Learning Series: Students In Higher Education At Scottish Institutions (2001).

In 2014, as well as being elected to the European Parliament, he was also elected as a councillor for the Sedgley ward on Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council, unseating a Conservative. His wife, Star, was also elected for UKIP in the Coseley East ward. Etheridge lost his seat on Dudley MBC in the May 2018 local council elections. In August 2014, Etheridge highlighted the speaking style of Adolf Hitler during a public-speaking seminar he gave to members of the UKIP youth wing, including the dangers it presented. According to Etheridge, he was \\"the most magnetic and forceful public speaker possibly in history\\" who \\"achieved a great deal\\" in relation to convincing people. A spokesman for UKIP said: \\"Bill Etheridge gave a seminar on public speaking and highlighted great speakers of the past, like Churchill, Blair, Martin Luther King and Hitler as people whose style, not content could be studied\\". When contacted by The Independent on Sunday, Etheridge stated that \\"Hitler and the Nazis were monsters\\" and said \\"At no point did I endorse Hitler or anybody else\\". At the general election in May 2015, Etheridge stood as UKIP's parliamentary candidate for Dudley North. He finished third with a vote of 9,113, triple that of the vote in 2010. At 24% of the votes cast, it also represented double the national average for UKIP. Etheridge, who is also a member of the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA), has been active in the UKIP front campaign; West Midlands Save The Pub. He has urged the Conservative government to increase the power of the Asset of Community Value, brought in as part of the Localism Act 2011. This would enable local communities to acquire their local pubs. This did lead to Etheridge making efforts to save a number of pubs in his ward, including The Seven Stars. Etheridge sat on the EU Regional Development Committee; his belief that power should be handed back to communities has seen him emerge as a critic of combined authorities. Etheridge is an associate of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). In May 2017, Etheridge launched his book; Putting Great Back In Britain, with a guest appearance from Nigel Farage. In the book, Etheridge outlines his vision for a post-Brexit Britain. Etheridge is a prominent UK libertarian and is chairman of The Indigo Group. He has launched a platform of libertarian policies in his EFDD book, Prosperous, Happy and at Peace, co-authored with Paul Brothwood. Etheridge launched a book, The EU's engagement with the politics of international recognition, co-authored with Paul Brothwood, at an EU conference about Somaliland on 6 December 2018. =UKIP leadership bids= In July 2016, Etheridge launched his bid to become leader of UKIP following the resignation of Nigel Farage. Launching his campaign at the Seven Stars pub in Sedgley, Etheridge said: \\"I want us to represent the view of the people against the establishment\\". Etheridge received 13.7% of the vote, with the third-most votes cast. He promised to work and support with the new leader, Diane James, who was only briefly in the post. His policy proposals included cheaper beer, better representation for fathers in the family court system and a referendum on bringing back the death penalty. Also amongst his policy proposals were prison reform and a move to save the British public house by reintroducing smoking via the use of efficient extraction systems as used within the European Parliament itself. While in favour of Muslim faith schools and same- sex marriage, he advocates banning the burka. In October 2016, Etheridge launched his bid to become leader of UKIP following Diane James' resignation, after declaring he would refuse to back Steven Woolfe and stand himself during an interview on the BBC's Sunday Politics. He withdrew on 25 October, and endorsed the eventual winner, Paul Nuttall. Etheridge subsequently launched his third leadership bid for the 2017 UK Independence Party leadership election, having previously stood in both of UKIP's 2016 leadership elections. A key divide between candidates was between what The Guardian described as \\"Farage-ist economic libertarians\\" like Etheridge and the \\"more hard-right, Islam-focused\\" Anne Marie Waters and Peter Whittle. Etheridge stated that \\"whichever side wins, the other side won't have a future in the party\\".

Between the wars, de Fonblanque held a number of staff posts, culminating in being appointed Chief Administration Officer of Scottish Command in 1937. In October 1938, he headed a British mission with the task of observing the withdrawal of the Czechoslovak Army from the Sudetenland under the terms of the Munich Agreement.Wilkinson, Peter and Astley, Joan (2010), Gubbins & SOE, Pen & Sword Military, (p. 33) British vehicles awaiting evacuation on the quayside at Cherbourg during Operation Ariel in June 1940. With the outbreak of the Second World War and the dispatch of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) to France in September 1939, de Fonblanque was appointed General Officer Commanding, Lines of Communication Area for the force, which was under the overall command of Lord Gort. De Fonblanque's responsibility was to facilitate the supply of everything required by the force in its forward positions on the border with Belgium. By January 1940, the total size of the BEF had risen to 222,200 men in six divisions. Originally, the materiel needed by the force was all channelled through depots at Nantes and Brest, but construction of an Advance Base Area began at Le Havre in November 1939. By the following April, some nineteen French ports were being used for British logistics, with up to 100,000 tons of stores being imported monthly. In addition to that, a network of reserve and forward supply depots had been constructed in an area extending over a third of France. As the Battle of France progressed, de Fonblanque, whose headquarters were at Le Mans, and much of his logistic chain, became separated from the fighting formations of the BEF by the German Blitzkrieg. The arrival of General Sir Alan Brooke on 13 June to command the remaining British troops in France, was the catalyst for the decision to evacuate all of them, an undertaking codenamed Operation Ariel. De Fonblanque was heavily involved in organising the landward side of the evacuation, which was successful in getting away almost all the men, some 190,000 of them, as well as a great quantity of invaluable guns, vehicles and stores that could easily have been lost. Winston Churchill later wrote in his memoirs, The Second World War: His death from an existing illness hastened by his heavy responsibilities in France took place in Cambridge on 2 July 1940, aged 54. He is buried in Cambridge City Cemetery.

He is best known for independent, experimental games, notably for his 2013 game Papers, Please and his 2018 game Return of the Obra Dinn, both of which won the Seumas McNally Grand Prize as part of the Independent Games Festival, among other awards. Early life Pope grew up in Virginia. His father was a handyman which gave Pope access to a well-stocked array of parts and tools to mess about with, giving him interest in mechanical engineering. When he got to high school, he met a friend who was interested in robotics, and the two of them would take retail robot kits, take them apart, and reconnect them to their own computers to see how they could control this. Inspired to continue into the mechanical and robotics field, Pope attended Virginia Tech to study mechanical engineering. He found that the reality of what constituted the field was less desirable than what he wanted, but did take strong interest in the computer programming side of his coursework. During this period, he got involved with the Quake community and helped to develop mods for Quake and other games, principally working on the art used for the characters in the mods. Video game development Pope collaborated with other video game modders, including working on an officially-sanctioned mod by Sony Pictures to promote Anaconda. Pope and another set of modders decided to form their own studio, Ratloop, releasing the total Quake conversion mod Malice in 1997. Ratloop struggled with distribution through retail channels. While Walmart would help distribute their game, the chain required Ratloop to have 5,000 copies ready to ship within 24 hours at any time, requiring Ratloop to secure a publisher to help. After a first failed 3D game, Ratloop decided to develop a car repair game, Gearhead Garage. It was successful enough to be picked up by Activision for retail distribution, and gave Ratloop sufficient funds to try a number of experimental games, something which had interested Pope. However, none of these were published, and facing competition from other studios, particularly from Eastern Europe, that could make games at substantially lower prices, Ratloop became dormant. Pope left Ratloop and joined Realtime Associates in 2003. While at Realtime, he was part of the team that developed the game Re-mission, a 2006 shooter whose goal was to encourage children with cancer to take their chemotherapy medication. Pope moved to Santa Monica and got a job with Naughty Dog in 2007. While Pope did not have a strong programming background, he felt that Naughty Dog had hired him because of his interest in developing the tools and interfaces needed to help in programming their games. Pope's strength in developing GUI tools augmented Naughty Dog's weakness at that time, with Pope stating that at the time of his hiring, \\"[t]here w[ere] no full-time GUI tools guy at all...Just command-line, back-end tools people.\\" Pope had been hired about halfway through the development of Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, and continued to work on the sequel Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. He credited the director of the sequel Bruce Straley for teaching him how to focus a game's design around core concepts to make the game fun, even if this meant sacrificing work that had already been completed. Former Naughty Dog President Christophe Balestra said of Pope's work on their design tools: \\"We were desperate to find a good tools programmer. He was part of the people who saved the day.\\" Specifically, Pope developed GUI tools for the games' menus systems, save systems, level layout to assist level designers, and a system to organize sound and text files for various languages. After Uncharted 2 had shipped in 2009, Naughty Dog was set to continue onto the next sequel, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, but Pope wanted to spend more time on his love of experimental games. In the interim between games, he and his wife Keiko Ishizaka spent two weeks to develop Mightier, a small game based around creating 3D levels from camera scans of a 2D drawing, and its title a play on the phrase \\"The pen is mightier than the sword\\". They submitted Mightier to the Independent Games Festival (IGF) where it was nominated for one of the awards, and which led to Valve contacting Pope about putting Mightier up on Steam as a free game. Both Pope and Ishizaka decided to quit their current jobs in 2010 and moved to Saitama, Japan, in close proximity to Ishizaka's family, and continue to pursue small independent game development. Pope at the 2014 Game Developers Conference Over the next few years, Pope and Ishizaka worked on a number of experimental games. One of their first was a mobile game called Helsing's Fire, which won the 2011 IGF for Best Mobile Game. Another title was The Republia Times in 2012 which he had come up with originally as part of a Ludum Dare game jam. He helped to port Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken, a game developed by members of Ratloop, to the PlayStation 3. This work required him and Ishizaka to temporarily live in Singapore for about a year with frequent trips to the United States. During these travels, Pope came upon an idea for a game involving a passport inspector, which served as the inspiration for Pope's breakout game, Papers, Please, released first in 2013. Papers, Please was critically praised, winning several awards including several Game Developers Choice and IGF awards, as well as a British Academy (BAFTA) Games Award for Best Simulation Game. For Pope and his wife, Papers, Please was financially successful; the game had sold about 1.8 million copies by August 2016, and through 2018, still sold enough that Pope was not worried about his financial security as he was developing his next game, Return of the Obra Dinn. Obra Dinns development had started shortly after Pope had completed all the work on Papers, Please, and took about four and a half years, principally due to Pope's expanded narrative. On its release in 2018, it received similar high praise as Papers, Please, and has been nominated for and won several awards from the Game Developers Choice, IGF, Peabody, and D.I.C.E. Awards, as well as named as one of the top games of 2018. Pope states he plans to still develop games but wants to keep these at a small size; Obra Dinn was meant to be a small-scale game but ballooned out larger than he anticipated, and wants his next title to stay small in scope. Personal life Pope and his wife Keiko Ishizaka live in Saitama, Japan, with two children. Both had met while working at Realtime and continued their relationship while Pope was at Naughty Dog while she was at nearby 2K Games.

She previously served as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Dublin constituency from 2014 to 2019. Early life Boylan grew up in the Kilnamanagh area of Tallaght. Initially studying journalism and gaining a certificate, she went on to earn post-graduate qualifications from University College Dublin in Environmental Impact Assessment and European Environmental Conservation Management. Early political career In 2005, Boylan moved to County Kerry while working as a coordinator for the Irish Wildlife Trust at Killarney National Park. That same year she joined Sinn Féin. Under her Irish- language name Lynn Ní Bhaoighealláin, she stood at the 2007 general election as the Sinn Féin candidate in the Kerry South constituency. With only 3.5% of the first-preference votes, she was eliminated on the first count. At the 2009 local elections, she stood for the Killarney local electoral area of Kerry County Council, but was again unsuccessful. She attributed her defeats to being an outsider: \\"As a Dub in Kerry the odds were stacked against me\\", she told the Irish Times in 2014. Boylan returned to Dublin in 2011 to work in Ballymun, for the Global Action Plan, an environmental initiative funded by Ballymun Regeneration. In 2010, she was appointed as chair of the advisory board of Safefood. In September 2013, Boylan was selected as the Sinn Féin candidate for the Dublin constituency at the European Parliament election in May 2014. She then left her job, and as a candidate was paid a wage by Sinn Féin while she went canvassing three or four times a day. Boylan began her campaign \\"practically anonymous\\", according to Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams. By April, Boylan was still described by the Irish Independent newspaper as a \\"political unknown\\". Instead of raising her media profile, Boylan's campaign concentrated on canvassing, mostly door-to-door rather than the busier shopping centres. Despite the lack of media exposure, by late May the polls showed Boylan in the lead. After voting on 23 May, Boylan won 23.6% of the first preference votes, and was elected on the third count. As the election count pointed towards Boylan's win, the Fianna Fáil candidate Mary Fitzpatrick asked: \\"Who could have said somebody would come from nowhere, no track record in Dublin, and still take the lead and steal the first seat and probably have a surplus?\\". Member of the European Parliament Boylan was a campaigner for the release of Ibrahim Halawa, an Irish citizen from Firhouse in South Dublin who was imprisoned in Egypt between 2013 and 2017 and was adopted by Amnesty International as a prisoner of conscience. In March 2015, Boylan described Halawa as an \\"Irish-speaking, GAA-playing Dublin lad\\", and asked if the Irish Government would do more if his name was \\"Paddy Murphy\\". In December 2015, Boylan sponsored a motion in the European Parliament calling Halawa's release. She introduced his two sisters to the Parliament before the vote, which passed by over 560 votes to 11. She lost her seat at the 2019 European Parliament election. Senator Boylan was elected to the Seanad in April 2020 as a Senator for the Agricultural Panel. Personal life Boylan is the partner of Eoin Ó Broin, who has been the Sinn Féin TD for Dublin Mid- West since 2016. They reside in Clondalkin, South Dublin.

It aimed to take on 125 pupils in September 2014, reaching an enrollment of 250 the following year. 167 pupils were offered places in the first year, almost 30% of whom were entitled to free school meals. In 2017 a collection of assemblies from the school's first three years was published.  Location  The school is located at 11 Tothill St in Steel House, a former Ministry of Justice building built in 1936, within walking distance of Westminster School, Westminster Abbey and St Margaret's Church on Parliament Square, where its assemblies are held.  Curriculum  Harris Westminster Sixth Form offers a mixed curriculum, consisting of both A Level and Cambridge Pre-U subjects. The Cambridge Pre-U is offered in Languages, English Literature, PTE and Art History. Subjects with the smallest uptakes (presently German, Drama & Theatre, Music and Classical Languages) are studied at Westminster School.

In its first year of A2 Level results, over 40% of results were A/A* and 25% of their students achieved at least 3 A grades with 50% taking up places at Russell Group universities and six at Oxford or Cambridge. In 2018, 47% of the A-level grades were A/A* (or equivalent), including 17% A* grades (or equivalent). Just under a half of the students attained at least an AAB combination of grades, while a quarter achieved A*AA or better. This marked the best examination performance in the school's history. In 2019, the school received 37 Oxbridge offers, bettering the record of many renowned private schools. In 2016, the school was investigated by Ofsted and consequently rated \\"outstanding\\" in all areas. In 2019, it was highlighted by the Good Schools Guide as an example of an effective partnership between state and private schools. Also in 2019, it was named \\"Sixth Form College of the Year\\" by The Sunday Times with the Oxbridge success and support for disadvantaged students noted.

On the economy, she argued for increased support for those who need retraining, and those who are long-term unemployed. Furthermore, she stated her desire for \\"smarter\\" regulation of the financial system. In terms of criminal justice, she said that helping drug addicts end their dependency, and prosecuting drug dealers whose customers end up dying was important; and in terms of education, she maintained it was important to \\"better join up children’s services across the fields of education, child care, health care and social services\\". She described the problem of climate change as a \\"climate ’emergency’\\", and wanted to see \\"far more radical change\\" to protect against the risks of climate change, suggesting several actions that could help do so, such as banning domestic flights, making it easier to build wind farms, and increased investment in green technology. However, she further explained how these actions should \\"realistic and fair\\", and not be funded by \\"expensive green taxes\\". In September 2019, she wrote on her website that she had taken part in climate marches, and explained her interest in ideas to promote increasing cycling and public transport in Oxford, and how \\"we simply cannot return to business as usual in the next parliamentary session\\". During the 2019 general election campaign, she argued in support of Labour's plans to increase corporation tax, because she believes \\"those with the broadest shoulders\\" should contribute more. After being appointed Shadow Chancellor in early 2020, she stated that she remained committed to \\"co-operative and mutual ownership\\", as was supported under Corbyn's leadership of the party, and opposed the introduction of a universal basic income.

Early life Haig was the son of Major Robert Wolseley Haig RA, FRS, (1830–72) the military astronomer. He was descended from the Haigs of Bonnington, branch of the Border house of Haig of Bemersyde. He is thus related to the first Lord Haig. He was educated at Wellington College, and then Sandhurst. Army career Haig joined the Seaforth Highlanders in 1884 and was transferred to the Indian Army in 1887 where he served in Upper Burma (1887–89) fighting \\"dacoits\\" (bandits). He won a medal and clasp for his service.\\"HAIG, Lt-Col Sir (Thomas) Wolseley\\" in Who Was Who, A & C Black, Oxford University Press, 2014, online edition. Retrieved 28 May 2014. He was promoted to Captain on 6 February 1895, and to Major on 6 February 1902. Indian civil service Haig entered the Berar Commission in 1892 and became Assistant Commissioner, then Deputy Commissioner, Inspector-General of Police, Jails, Stamps, Registration, and Excise, and Civil and Sessions Judge. He was officiating Secretary to the Board of Examiners, Fort William, 1897 and 1898–99. He entered the Political Department in 1901 as First Assistant to the Resident at Hyderabad, a post that gave him day to day control of Berar. Haig became Assistant Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department, in 1907, then Political Agent in Alwar, 1907–08. Following the assassination of Sir Curzon Wyllie in London by Madan Lal Dhingra in 1909, Haig was appointed officiating Political ADC to the Secretary of State for India 1909–10 (Lord Morley). Haig's final years abroad were spent mostly in Persia. He was the British Consul at Kerman in 1910, became First Assistant to the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan in 1912 and quickly moved on to become Consul- General and Agent to the Government of India, Khurasan, Persia in 1914–16. He held the same post at Ispahan 1916 and Tehran 1919. He retired in 1920. Academic career Soon after Haig returned to Europe, he was appointed Professor of Arabic, Persian and Hindustani at Trinity College, Dublin. Later he was lecturer in Persian at the School of Oriental Studies, University of London. Haig was known for his meticulous attention to detail and the careful planning which went into his work. Some reviewers said that he tended to go too far and produce an overly-detailed end result, but his writings appeared in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, and other learned societies, and he was assigned the third and fourth volumes of The Cambridge History of India. Unfortunately, he was only able to fully complete the third volume before illness set in and the fourth had to be completed by Richard Burn to Haig's plan. It was published in 1937, the year before Haig's death. Haig made two important translations into English of Badaoni's Tarikh-i-Bada'uni (history), a source for the reign of Emperor Akbar's, and the Burhan-i-Massir of Tabatabai, an important source for the Nizam Shahi dynasty of Ahmadnagar.

It effectively incorporates the English case of Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd [1980] AC 827 into New Zealand case law. Background Richmond arranged for DHL to courier some shipping documents relating to the sale of leather worth US$57,460 to a company called Bini in Italy, for which they were charged the modest courier fee of $22.50. Richmond declined DHL’s offer to purchase insurance for direct loss, nor purchase similar insurance from elsewhere insurance consequential loss. Richmond also accepted DHL’s standard terms of limiting its liability for direct losses to $100, and a total exclusion of liability for consequential loss. In order to ensure that Richmond got paid for the leather, they arranged for the documents to couriered to a bank in Italy and not to Bini directly. Unfortunately, for reasons unknown, these shipping documents were couriered directly to Bini. It was never ascertained just why this happened, but the judge suggested that as the delivery address was handwritten and hard to read, it was possible that the courier opened it and got Bini's address in error. This unfortunately allowed Bini to uplift the leather shipment from the port without first paying. Bini subsequently went into liquidation without making payment. Richmond sued DHL for the substantial consequential loss that resulted. DHL claimed they were not liable for damages due to their exclusion of liability clause. Held The Court of Appeal ruled that as Richmond had taken the business risk for such a loss by electing not to purchase insurance for consequential loss, and that the exemption clause here was perfectly valid.

With a length of 15 km and a maximum width of 6 km (due to a large bay on northwest side), Mondonac lake has an area of more than 23 km². It is located in the southwest part of the township of Sincennes. Mondonac lake whose depth reaches 100 m, collects water from several surrounding lakes, including Lake Salone, its neighbor to the south-east and the mouth of which is 10.5 km from the southern part of Lake Mondonac. It receives waters of ten highest lakes including: Crane, Miror, Saracen, Rosette, Comfort, Cormorant and Kasesekatikwakawarik. The mouth of Lake Mondonac is located at the bottom of a long bay at northeast. The river Mondonac that forms the outlet of the lake, flows north, collecting the waters of Lake Sincennes, then flows into the Châteauvert Lake (La Tuque).Geographical Audit conducted on May 23, 2014, by historian Gaétan Veillette (Saint-Hubert, QC) with reference to maps published on the website Google map. In May 2010, a large forest fire occurred around Lake Mondonac. Dam Mondonac Property of Hydro-Québec, the dam at the mouth of Lake Mondonac in Fremont Zec is considered high capacity. It is mostly used for wildlife. At a height of 3.2 m. and a dam height of 2.6 m., the dam was originally built in 1944 and modified in 1998. It was built with wooden boxes filled with stones, and foundations are based on the rock. The catchment area is 328 km². Retained its capacity is 60,138,000 m³. The area of the reservoir is 2313 ha. The length of the structure is 30 m.  Toponymy  This name Mondonac originates from an Algonquin word meaning \\"region of souls or spirits\\". The specific Mondonac - or graphical variant \\"Mondonak\\" - appears on various documents at least since the second half of the nineteenth century. The surveyors report L.-A.-O. Arcand and E.B.

Bairstow assisted Adolfo De Nesti (1870-1935) of Florence with the statuary of the District (Wilson) Building in Washington DC, was constructed between 1902 and 1908. Its allegorical attic figures represent Sculpture, Painting, Architecture, Music, Commerce, Engineering, Agriculture and Statesmanship.

Around 1906 Bairstow created the Eagle lampposts at the Taft Bridge (Connecticut Avenue Bridge) in Washington. The lamps were cast by the J. L. Motts Iron Works, New York. The lions were made by sculptor Roland Hinton Perry. Bairstow created plaster composition figures of the muses that were installed in arches over boxes on each side of the stage of the Gayety Theater in Washington. The theater was completed in 1907, designed by architect William H. McElfatrick (1854-1922). The theater originally was a member of the Columbia Circuit of Burlesque theaters. After going through many changes, the theater was torn down in November 1959. The United States General Services Administration Building, originally designed for the U.S. Department of the Interior, was built between 1915 and 1917. Bairstow carved the eagle over the central opening, designed the twenty-eight limestone panels in the frieze on the sixth story, and undertook the ornamental work on the F Street entrances. In 1986 the building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Bairstow carved the exterior decoration of the Lincoln Memorial and the inscriptions inside between 1914 and 1922.

Bairstow began to carve the friezes and inscriptions of the monument as soon as the stone of the upper parts of the monument was in place. On the main frieze he carved the names of the states and the wreathes in place. He probably roughed out the garlands and eagles of the attic frieze in the workshop. Bairstow also carved the letters on the interior of the monument. This included the text composed by Royal Cortissoz of the New York Herald Tribune above the Lincoln statue, which reads \\"In this temple, as in the hearts of the people for whom he saved the Union, the memory of Abraham Lincoln is enshrined forever.\\" He also carved the Gettysburg Address and Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address on the walls on either side of the statue.

Origins and significance The flag first appeared in the middle of the 1970s, after the death of Francisco Franco, in an era when the rights of the regional communities were being reclaimed and re-established across Spain. Despite the flag's relatively recent origins, various interpretations exist regarding why green, white, and black were chosen and what they signify; even the inventor or creator of the flag is unknown. What is known is that by the 1980s the flag had become so popular amongst Extremadurans as the principal symbol of regional identity that those who presented the Statute of Autonomy in 1983 did not hesitate in including an article concerning this flag in this Statute. In official government publications, the colors of the flag are said to honor aspects of the region's history during the Middle Ages: * Green: color of the emblem of the Order of Alcántara. * White: representing the Kingdom of León, which repopulated the region during the Reconquista. * Black: representing the Aftasid kings of the Taifa of Badajoz. However, in 2008, in the regional press, a professor of history named Antonio Galache Cortés posited his own theory on the meaning of the flag's colors. Galache Cortés believed that the color green referred to the Muslim era of Spain, in which Extremadura enjoyed its only period of complete independence as an Aftasid taifa. The color white referred to the Kingdom of León and the integration of the region into what would become Spain, while black was the color of the clothing worn by the Lusitanians, according to Strabo. Galache Cortés’ theory has been disputed. In a television interview, Luis Ramallo, president of the region before the era of autonomy, attributed the creation of the flag to a lawyer from Oliva de la Frontera, Martín Rodríguez Contreras. This theory was supported by professor of anthropology Javier Marcos Arévalo, who in his studies on Extremaduran identity states that Rodríguez Contreras’ design was chosen after various proposals and its colors were derived from the following: *Green and white from the traditional colors of Cáceres. *Black and white from the colors of Badajoz. In terms of symbolic meaning, the green symbolizes hope, the white honor of the people, the black to unemployment, marginalization, and backwardness, although it can also refer to the region's Almohad past. Javier Marcos Arévalo adds that the flag first appears in the written record on February 27, 1977 and made its first public appearance on November 14, 1976 at Oliva de la Frontera. Its first official sanction occurred in the city of Cáceres after a motion was passed by the Junta Preautonómica and later made into law by the Statute of Autonomy. The widow of Martín Rodríguez Contreras has written articles also attributing the creation of the flag to her husband. Another theory on the flag's colors, which has become a popular one, asserts that the flag originated when the colors of the football clubs of the two capitals of the province, the Club Polideportivo Cacereño (green shirt, white shorts) and the Club Deportivo Badajoz (black-and-white shirt, white shorts) were combined. However, the two athletic clubs simply took their colors from the traditional colors of their respective cities and provinces: green for Cáceres and black (from the Aftasid taifa) for Badajoz. Another theory explains the colors as signifying: *Green: hope for a new Extremadura. *White: purity of the natural environment. *Black: sadness of the various emigrants who have had to leave their beloved land.

Elected as the Member of Parliament for Northampton South in the 2017 general election, he previously served as Member of the European Parliament for the East Midlands from 2014 to 2017. Early life and career Lewer was born 18 July 1971 in Burnley, Lancashire. He attended Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School in Ashbourne, Derbyshire before studying History at Newcastle University. He then entered into a career in publishing. Living in Derbyshire, he was elected as a Conservative Party Councillor to Derbyshire Dales District Council for the Ashbourne South ward in 2003 and then to Derbyshire County Council for the Ashbourne division in 2005. He became Group Leader in 2007. The Conservatives took control of Derbyshire County Council in 2009, for the first time in 28 years, making Lewer the youngest county council leader in the country at the time. As Leader of the County Council, he also became Chairman of the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site committee, the founding Chairman of the Health and Wellbeing Board and a founding director of the Local Enterprise Partnership for Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire - D2N2. Although he was re-elected as a councillor, in the 2013 elections Labour regained control of Derbyshire County Council and Lewer lost his position as Council Leader. He was awarded an MBE for services to local government in 2014. At the conclusion of his three year term of office as Leader of Derbyshire County Council, Andrew Lewer became Vice-President of the Local Government Association (LGA), a position he retains to this day.  Member of the European Parliament  Lewer was elected to the European Parliament representing the East Midlands in 2014, replacing the former Conservative MEP Roger Helmer, who had defected to UKIP. Lewer was appointed to the Regional Development Committee and the Culture Committee as spokesperson for the European Conservative and Reformists Group in 2014.{{cite weburl=http://conservativeeurope.com/publications/Westminster%20Guide%203_Layout%2018.pdf He supported the UK leaving the EU, feeling David Cameron had failed to gain any meaningful concessions from his European counterparts.  Member of Parliament  In May 2017, Lewer was selected to run as the new Conservative Party candidate for the Northampton South parliamentary constituency after the sitting Conservative MP David Mackintosh stood down in the face of a police investigation into alleged irregularities surrounding a controversial loan he had approved in his former role as the leader of the local council. Lewer was reportedly on his way to Brussels when he took a call informing him he was shortlisted, and had to turn around to get back in time for the meeting. Although not from Northampton, Lewer represented Northamptonshire within his East Midlands region as an MEP. Lewer was subsequently elected Member of Parliament for Northampton South in the 2017 general election. Following his election win, he stood down as an MEP and was replaced in that role by former author Rupert Matthews. He retained his seat at the 2019 general election with an increased majority. In March 2018, Lewer was criticised by local campaigners over cuts to library services in Northampton. Criticism followed the announcement that 21 book-lending services were at risk of closure in Northamptonshire, after the Conservative run County Council cut £40 million from its budget. Lewer responded that he had been far from silent on the issue and that he had been a long-standing critic of the leadership of the Council. In February 2018, following the announcement that Northamptonshire County Council had brought in a \\"section 114\\" notice, putting it in special measures following a crises in its finances, Lewer was one of seven local MPs who released a statement arguing that the problems with the authority were down to mismanagement from the Conservative councillors who led it rather than funding cuts from the Conservative Government. They further argued that government commissioners should take over the running of the Council. In August 2018, Lewer broke ranks with the other MPs and said that while mismanagement had fuelled the Northamptonshire crisis, the council was also a victim of underlying financial pressures affecting all local authorities with social care responsibilities. In Parliament, he served on the European Scrutiny Committee and the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee, during his first mandate. During the meaningful vote period, Andrew Lewer voted against the Government twice before voting for it a third time when faced with Theresa May reneging on her commitment to take the UK out of the EU on the 29th March 2019. During the subsequent Leadership election, Andrew Lewer supported Esther McVey and then Boris Johnson Following the 2019 General Election, Andrew Lewer was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Home Office, having previously served after Boris Johnson was elected as PPS to the Northern Ireland Office, the Wales Office and the Scotland Office. He is a member of the European Research Group and Chairs the All Party Parliamentary Groups on Motor Neurone Disease, Venezuela, Independent Education, Devolution, Publishing, and SME Housebuilding.  Personal life  Lewer is married and has a young son. He is an honorary Alderman of the county of Derbyshire, where he was based before being elected as an MP. He is also employed part-time as a consultant to a property development company based in Derbyshire.

Early life and education  Born in Gloucester, Winifred was the youngest daughter of the six children of Frederick John and Louisa (née Corbett) Cullis. The family moved to Birmingham in 1880. She was initially educated at a middle school, the Summer Hill School, and at 16 transferred to the associated King Edward VI High School for Girls, Birmingham and took extra science classes at Mason College. She entered Newnham College, Cambridge in 1896, financed by a Sidgwick scholarship, and achieved a second in both parts of the natural sciences tripos (1899 and 1900). While an undergraduate student she was supervised in the Physiological Laboratory by John Newport Langley. She was not awarded a degree since Cambridge did not award degrees to women at this time. (However, Cambridge University awarded her an MA in 1927). She was awarded DSc by London University in 1908 for Experiments upon the isolated mammalian heart, especially with regard to the action of defibrinated blood upon it. She was described as having a generous spirit and had a gift for making persuasive and engaging speeches. Her values were as a feminist and intellectual with great personal integrity and loyalty. At school she had been good at acting, singing and tennis as well as academic study. In later life she enjoyed the arts and cross-stitch. She died on 13 November 1956 at her home, Vincent House in Pembridge Square, London.  Career  Cullis began her career at the Royal College of Surgeons and of the Royal College of Physicians in 1901 as an assistant to T. G. Brodie as well as working part-time in a school. Cullis then appointed as a demonstrator in physiology at the London School of Medicine for Women later in 1901. She was subsequently appointed as a co-lecturer with T. G. Brodie from 1903 and then as a part-time lecturer in 1908. Cullis collaborated with several others including William Dobinson Halliburton and Walter Ernest Dixon. In 1912 she obtained a full-time post as lecturer and head of department, with the title as university reader in physiology. In 1916 she spent a year on secondment at the University of Toronto as the acting professor of physiology. She finally became a professor of physiology at the University of London in 1919 and the named Sophia Jex- Blake chair of physiology in 1926. She was the second woman in the UK to be appointed to a chair at a British university-level institution. She retired as professor emeritus in 1941. In 1915 Cullis was one of the first five women elected as members of the Physiological Society and served on the society's committee from 1918 to 1925. She also presided at the 1920 society meeting. While working with T G Brodie, her physiological research focused on the mechanisms of secretion of urine and of gas exchanges in the heart and intestine. With time, her interests changed to considering healthy living in people such as through sports science and effects of fatigue on factory workers. She also became involved with science education both nationally and internationally, including the fostering of international goodwill and the emancipation of both sexes through education. Scientific publications Cullis was author or co-author of at least 18 scientific publications as well as several books. She also gave a very large number of public talks. *Winifred Cullis (1949) Your Body and the Way it Works. Illustrations by Horace J Knowles.

These included: In 1919 she gave lectures to military personnel stationed in Gibraltar and Malta at the request of the Colonial Office. In 1931 she gave support to a public subscription for building a ward in the new Royal Free Hospital to be named in memory of Mary Scharlieb. In the 1930s she toured the world extensively promoting higher education for women and also promoted adult education via radio shows. During and after the Second World War she gave many lectures about Britain in wartime. In 1940–41 she gave these in China, Japan, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Australia, New Zealand, and the USA. She was based in New York in the USA from 1941 to 1943 as Director of the women's section of the British information services and moved to the Middle East in 1944–5 to lecture to the Royal Air Force. She considered that biology and the applications of science to life should be part of everyone's knowledge and included in the school curriculum. As an example of her action in this area, she devised programmes for physical education and ballet teachers in schools run by the London County Council.  Committee work, influence and honours In 1919 she was appointed to the Order of the British Empire (OBE) and in 1929 was raised to the rank of Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE). Cullis was awarded honorary degrees by Vassar College, USA (1919), Goucher College, USA (1931), and Birmingham University (1955). She was president of the British Federation of University Women (1925–1929) and the International Federation of University Women (1929–1932). The International Federation of University Women has an award in her honour. Cullis was a member of a large number of committees in the later part of her career. These included the clinical management committee of the Institute of Child Psychology, the council of the National Institute of Industrial Psychology and the Home Office committee on the two-shift system for women and young persons, the British Association for the Advancement of Science, the Trades Union Congress committee on scientific planning of industry, the Central Council of Recreative Physical Training, the King Edward VII Hospital Fund, the BBC Council for Adult Education, and the governing bodies of the Royal Academy of Dancing and Chelsea Polytechnic. She was chairman of the British Film Institute's educational panel, and from 1951 until her death, deputy chair of the English-Speaking Union. She was also a director of the Time and Tide magazine.

Background Quirke Export exported 2 shipments of onions to Taiwan. The size of the onions were important, with the onions required to be of a minimum size of between 2.25 and 2.5 inches, in order to suit the processing equipment in fast food restaurants. In order that the onions exported were not smaller than this size, they hired SGS to certify the onions did not exceed the minimum allowable size. SGS were employed on the basis that any liability for damages was limited to a maximum of 10 times the SGS inspection fee charged, with the clause stating \\"The company's responsibility under this certificate is limited to gross negligence proven by Principals and will in no case be more than 10 times fees or commissions\\". In 1983 SGS issued inspection certificates for 2 shipments of onions, charging $125, where upon delivery in Taiwan, were discovered to be outside the size requirements allowed, with 26% of the first shipment being found undersized, and the 76% of the second shipment. It was subsequently discovered that SGS had issued the inspection certificates without first inspecting the onions, which the court later held as gross negligence on SGS's part. These undersized onions were subsequently sold at a loss, and Quirke sued SGS for damages, and the High Court awarded $35,000 in damages against SGS. SGS appealed, claiming that in any case, their liability for damages was limited to $1,125. Decision The Court of Appeal ruled that the actual loss was not $35,007, but instead only $8,000. However, the court ruled that the limitation clause was valid, and reduced the damages award to $1,250.

European Parliament Dance was elected to the European Parliament in 2014. On entering the European Parliament, he was appointed to the European Parliament Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, responsible for a wide range of policy areas including air and water pollution, waste management, and climate change. He is a Vice-Chair of the committee and has chaired committee meetings, joint meetings with other committees such as AGRI, as well as formal trilogue meeting on the Drinking Water Directive. He also sat on the European Parliament Committee on Development, overseeing the spending commitments and priorities of the EU's development budget. Dance was appointed as a shadow rapporteur for the revision of the National Emissions Ceiling Directive (NECD), which aims to improve levels of air quality by regulating the emissions of harmful pollutants. This is particularly important issue for London, where over 3,000 people are dying prematurely each year as a result of exposure to poor air quality. He became the S&D; spokesperson on air quality following his appointment as a Shadow Rapporteur on the NECD. Following the \\"Dieselgate\\" scandal involving the use of so-called cheat devices in Volkswagen cars the European Parliament voted to set up a committee of inquiry to look into the scandal, the extent to which EU institutions acted on knowledge of the presence of software to limit emission abatement technology in the automotive industry and to provide recommendations on how to prevent a similar scandal in the future. He was appointed by his group colleagues in the Committee to be the Co-Ordinator for the S&D; group on the committee, meaning he chairs the delegation of S&D; MEPs in the committee and is the group's spokesperson on the committee. In the 2014 Parliament, Dance was appointed as the Rapporteur for the DEVE Committee for delivering the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The \\"Dance Report\\" provided the European Parliament with its first blueprint for delivering the SDGs across all areas of the Parliament's work as well as holding the other EU institutions to account on their programmes for delivering the SDGs. He is also a shadow rapporteur on a proposal for an integrated approach to tackle the link between conflict and the trade of minerals extracted from affected areas. He supported Owen Smith in the 2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election. In February 2017, he held up a placard directed at UKIP MEP Nigel Farage, saying \\"He's lying to you\\" when Farage made a speech to the EU Parliament defending Donald Trump's 90-day ban on immigrants from seven countries entering the United States. UKIP MEP Bill Etheridge consequently wrote to Antonio Tajani (President of the European Parliament) to complain about the incident, claiming that it was \\"disgusting behaviour\\" and \\"pathetic\\". Dance later wrote to Tajani, saying he apologised for the method, but not the message. Dance has been a consistent supporter of the EU and the need for multilateralism to combat extremism and climate change, and has been a vociferous opponent of Brexit.

Players flick basketballs through 2D physics puzzles into the hoop in single-player, local multiplayer, and asynchronous HORSE-style online multiplayer modes. The game is free-to-play with in-app purchases. Development began in mid 2011 following Mikengreg's successful Solipskier. They were able to live from the earnings for Gasketball two year development at their previous salary, which afforded them the stability to try new avenues and reject prototypes, though they worked 100-hour weeks. Towards the end of their development, they ran out of money and lived on the couches of friends. It was released on August 9, 2012, and the game did not reach their desired conversion rate at the time of launch. The game received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Pocket Gamer gave the game their silver award, and Tim Rogers of Kotaku named Gasketball his 2012 game of the year, calling it \\"the beginning of the hardcore social game genre\\".  Gameplay  Gasketball is a part-basketball, part-puzzler shot-matching sports video game where players flick basketballs through 2D physics puzzles (with flippers, portals, circular saw blades, and gravity switches) into a basketball hoop. Some puzzles include banking the basketball shot off multiple surfaces before making the basket. In the HORSE-style games, the player must match the exact setup of the opponent's shot, such as hitting the floor before entering the hoop. In the campaign, players get more points for making the shot without retrying, and have five attempts to make the hoop before moving to the next level shamefully. Players are awarded medals for the quality of their performance at the end of each chapter. Gold medals unlock new modes of play in the chapter. Every chapter has a unique theme, such as a construction site or outer space. The game has local two-player multiplayer with a divided iPad screen, and asynchronous online multiplayer where players construct levels for their opponents to complete. Players spin a wheel at the beginning of their turn to determine how many hazards they get to place via drag and drop. A few of the items are unlocked at first, and more are available with progress through the game or in-app purchases. Gasketball uses a colorful palette and features a cranky robot, who provides a tutorial and resets the ball. It was released as free-to-play with the tutorial unlocked, and four to five chapters available as additional paid downloads.  Development  Gameplay trailer Gasketball was developed and produced by Mikengreg, an Iowa- based two-man team: Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend. After releasing their first game, the sport-inspired Solipskier for iPhone and iPad, Boxleiter and Wohlwend lived off the profits for two years while working on Gasketball, paying themselves their same salaries from their Adobe Flash development days but having the security to try new ideas. Wohlwend made somewhat more income due to other collaborations, such as Puzzlejuice with Asher Vollmer, but shared his income with Boxleiter. Development began in mid 2011. Even though Solipskier was successful, the duo did not have a following comparable to indie developers like Team Meat and thus did not feel pressured to meet high expectations. Instead, their pressure was internal. Wohlwend said he worked 100-hour weeks with no weekends or vacations while living on the Solipskier funds. When they ran out of money, Boxleiter borrowed money from his parents, and eventually they both went homeless, living on the couches of friends. In making Gasketball, Boxleiter and Wohlwend felt that their game quality had been improving over time, though designing for a million-person audience was \\"daunting\\" and Wohlwend questioned whether he could even recreate Solipskier success. The former game was designed in fits of creativity while the latter had no such moments, and took longer to produce. They discarded \\"everything\\" multiple times during their prototyping process with the understanding that anything less than what they wanted would lead to a subpar end result. Boxleiter had difficulty accepting praise towards the end of development, considering the weight of having to leave the industry if the many 100-hour weeks did not pan out in an accepted product. Mikengreg first announced the game on March 1, 2012, and it was later released for iPad on August 9, 2012. Mikengreg decided to release the game as free-to-play for the base game with in-app purchases for the extended content. Wohlwend saw that a quarter of the top-grossing games on iOS used in-app purchases (albeit with predatory practices) and felt that they could follow the model with a more ethical strategy: free to play, but pay once to unlock forever. Wohlwend later remarked that, \\"So far, humanity is proving to us that we can't have it both ways.\\" They were told by friends that the purchase function was too hidden, which they later fixed. Journalists had noted the difficulty in purchasing the full version as well. Gasketball had been downloaded 200,000 times in its August 2012 launch week and was briefly ranked near the top of an iTunes top downloads ranking, though it did not break the top 200 grossing chart. The game's conversion rate from its free-to-play base package to the paid version was 0.67%—lower than their goal of at least 2% of an estimated five million downloads. The paid addition includes 100 additional levels and 10 new objects.  Reception  The game received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers noted the game's character and creative vision. Pocket Gamer gave the game their silver award. Gasketball was Tim Rogers of Kotaku 2012 game of the year. Edge noted Mikengreg's deft ability with simple sound effects, citing their previous work with Solipskier. They praised the \\"sweet and personable\\" art design and the mix of \\"freewheeling creativity with arcade precision\\". Edge also praised the addition of the \\"decent\\" single-player campaign alongside the multiplayer. Pocket Gamer Harry Slater called the single-player \\"entertaining\\" but felt the asynchronous multiplayer was the highlight. TouchArcade Brad Nicholson called the game a cross between Amazing Alex and NBA Jam. While he found some puzzle designs imbalanced, Nicholson also felt that the interactions between the flipper and portal hazards were \\"surprisingly solid\\" and noted the game's lighthearted \\"welcome playground sort of feel\\" even as the easy learning curve reached Rube Goldberg-like complexity. Tim Rogers of Kotaku called Gasketball the \\"inverse Rube Goldberg\\" and \\"the beginning of the hardcore social game genre, of asynchronous gameplay as meaningful as FPS deathmatches\\".

Bibb House is a historic residence in Madison, Alabama. Bibb was an early landholder in Madison, one of the main proponents of its incorporation in 1869, and distant relative of Alabama's first two governors, William Wyatt Bibb and Thomas Bibb. In 1866, Bibb purchased 300 acres (120 ha) west of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad depot, farming corn and cotton himself on half of it and renting out the other half. He also owned a mercantile business and a steam-powered grist mill in the small town. Bibb's house was built in 1867 in a simple Greek Revival style; this is in contrast to most contemporary houses in Madison, which were built in more current Victorian styles. The house is 50 feet (15 m) square with a pyramidal hip roof and is covered with poplar clapboards. A partial-hip roof porch, supported by six square columns, stretches across the entire front of the house. The main entrance is flanked by single-pane sidelights and topped with a twin-pane transom. The interior is laid out with a central hall and three rooms on either side. A shed roofed porch and a garage have been added to the rear of the house, and an addition containing a bedroom, bathroom, and porch was added to the north side.

Gantt and Sarah Blakey Gantt (née Perkins), was born in Virginia in 1831. He attended the Virginia Military Institute from 1848 to 1851; graduating as 23rd out of 29. Farming and managing one of his family possessions, 508 acres of land named Valmont, he inherited that land when his father died in 1860. In the wake of John Brown's raid in 1859 Henry Gantt joined the Virginia Militia, by 1861 being captain and commanding officer of the Scottsville Guard. When the American Civil War broke out the Scottsville Guard become Company C of the 19th Virginia Infantry and Gantt was named Major of the regiment. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel on April 29, 1862, and was wounded in the Second Battle of Manassas. On September 14 he was promoted to colonel and gained command of the 19th Virginia. He led his unit into the Battle of Gettysburg. On July 3, 1863 they participated in the Pickett-Pettigrew-Trimble Charge and Gantt was shot in the face, losing his teeth. Colonel Gantt was transported back to Virginia, being on leave until returning to the field in 1864. Gantt commanded the 19th Virginia during the Battle of North Anna. After being hospitalized again he briefly commanded the brigade during the Bermuda Hundred Campaign and at Petersburg but apparently was hospitalized again in March 1965. He was paroled on June 1, 1865. Gantt returned to his estate and married Martha Burke Eppes shortly after the war; the pair would eventually have 3 daughters.

He hailed from Houguan (modern Fuzhou, Fujian). Dong Feng, together with Hua Tuo and Zhang Zhongjing, was one of the \\"Three physicians of Jian'an\\", although his skill was ranked the lowest of the three. The physician Ge Hong wrote a biography of Dong Feng in the Shenxian zhuan. The apricot forest Many legends surround the life and work of Dong Feng. As a physician, it is said that Dong Feng would refuse monetary payment for his services. Instead, he would ask patients successfully cured of minor ailments to plant a single apricot kernel, and those cured of severe ailments were asked to plant five kernels. A forest of apricot trees came to surround his home as a testament to his skill. Dong Feng became known as \\"He of the apricot forest\\". Later generations would come to describe physicians and those in the medical profession poetically as being \\"Those of the apricot forest\\", and their place of work, i.e. hospitals, as being \\"apricot forests\\". Dong Feng allowed people to pick his apricots in exchange for an equal amount of grain. Ge Hong recounts a story of one man who tried to take a greater quantity of apricots than the grain he had offered to Dong Feng. Five tigers appeared as the man departed from the apricot grove. He was frightened by tigers and spilled several of his apricots. By chance, the remaining apricots in the man's container equaled the grain that he had paid to Dong Feng, so the tigers stopped chasing him.

He discusses the need to correlate ritual observance with spirituality and love, the importance of Kavanah (intention) when performing mitzvot. He engages in a discussion of religious behaviorism—when people strive for external compliance with the law, yet disregard the importance of inner devotion.

He was the Leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) in Scotland until he quit in December 2018. Early life and career Coburn was born in Glasgow, Scotland. He studied law at the University of Leeds, but failed to graduate with a degree. He worked as an art dealer and City of London financial trader before owning a freight company. Political career Coburn contested the South-east London constituency of Old Bexley and Sidcup in 2010, and finished in fifth place with 1,532 votes. He also stood in Bexley and Bromley at the 2012 London Assembly election, finishing in fourth place. When the results of the 2014 European Parliament elections were declared, his permanent address was listed as Kensington, London. During the campaign he lived in a rented property in Edinburgh. Coburn ran in the 2014 European Parliament election to become a Member of the European Parliament for the Scotland constituency, as a member of UKIP Scotland. At the end of 2013, UKIP Scotland was dissolved after infighting tore the regional party apart; the party's administrative body was dissolved, Mike Scott-Hayward (the chairman and chief fundraiser) quit, and UKIP leader, Nigel Farage, fired Lord Christopher Monckton via email. The main party as a whole, and UKIP Scotland focused on supporting the candidates for the upcoming European elections. After Coburn won the seat, he was appointed leader of UKIP Scotland. His victory made him UKIP's second openly gay MEP, after Nikki Sinclaire. According to SNP candidate Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, Coburn repeatedly muddled her name at hustings during the European election campaign, when she was standing against him, referring to her as \\"Pashmina, Jasmine and Tamzin before eventually settling on a combination of 'love', 'dear' and 'honey'.\\" UKIP's Scottish chairman Arthur (Misty) Thackeray responded by saying \\"How humourless and thin-skinned are these people trying to make faux outrage stories about a slip of the tongue over a name? ... It wasn't mispronounced throughout the entire Euro campaign. It was mispronounced once; if memory serves me correctly, David called her Jasmina.\\" In 2015, Coburn compared Scottish government minister Humza Yousaf to the convicted terrorist Abu Hamza, later apologising and calling it a \\"joke\\". The then UKIP leader Nigel Farage called it a \\"joke in bad taste\\" and the then President of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, stated that whereas the remarks were \\"not worthy of any elected member\\", he could not act on remarks made outside parliament. Parliamentary candidate Tim Wilson quit the party in response, saying he had been \\"systematically gagged by the party whip and forbidden to speak about Islam favourably\\". In April 2015, a account operated by Coburn's office was blocked indefinitely for edit warring over Coburn's Wikipedia article. Coburn claimed he had directed one of his staff to make the changes in order to clear the page of \\"garbage\\" and \\"nonsense\\"; some news outlets attribute those edits to Coburn himself. In the 2015 general election, Coburn stood for the Falkirk constituency. During the campaign, he came out in favour of fracking in the area, in the face of local concerns. In July 2016, Coburn declared his support for Steven Woolfe in UKIP's leadership election to replace Nigel Farage. In the 2017 general election, Coburn unsuccessfully ran for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, securing just 1.2% of the vote and losing his deposit in the race. On 7 December 2018, Coburn quit UKIP and became an independent MEP. He joined the Brexit Party in February 2019 but did not seek re-election in the 2019 European Parliament election and stood down as an MEP on 1 July 2019. Following the 2019 general election, Coburn applied to join the Scottish Conservatives, but was rejected on the instruction of party leader Jackson Carlaw. In July 2020, he announced his support for the Alliance for Unity, a Pro-Scottish Unionist electoral alliance founded by former Scottish MP George Galloway.  Personal life  Coburn is gay. He speaks fluent French and conversational Arabic.

He was affectionately called \\"the Happy Republican\\". Biography After Bollinger graduated in 1932 amid the Great Depression from Lockport High School, now Central Lafourche High School, his father, George I. Bollinger, taught him and his three brothers, Dick, George, and Ralph, the mechanics of shipbuilding. Alex Barker, the senior Bollinger's employer, became a mentor to young Donald. In 1946, Bollinger launched his own business, Bollinger Machine Shop, now Bollinger Shipyards on Bayou Lafourche south of Lockport, along with help from his brothers, who returned from service in World War II. In 1979, Bollinger contributed $73,000 either individually or through his shipbuilding enterprises to Republican gubernatorial candidate U.S. Representative David C. Treen of Louisiana's 3rd congressional district.Shreveport Journal, March 6, 1980, p. 1 In 1980, he joined the Treen administration, the first Republican governorship since Reconstruction, as the secretary of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety & Corrections, a member of the governor's cabinet. In 1986, as a former treasurer of the state GOP, Bollinger advanced to the position of Republican state chairman in a divisive campaign that unseated the seven-year incumbent, George Despot, an oilman from Shreveport. However, under Bollinger's tutelage, the Louisiana GOP failed to elect U.S. Representative Henson Moore of Louisiana's 6th congressional district to succeed the retiring Democratic U.S. Senator Russell B. Long. Instead victory went to Long's preferred successor, fellow Democrat John Breaux, who held the seat for another eighteen years before it was finally won by a Republican, David Vitter in 2004. Bollinger stepped down as chairman in 1988 and was succeeded by another veteran of the Treen administration, William \\"Billy\\" Nungesser of New Orleans. Nungesser's son, Billy Nungesser, became President of Plaquemines Parish. Coincidentally, Nungesser's company, General Marine and Catering, serviced the offshore industry for which Bollinger built the ships. Bollinger was a member of Lions International, the Holy Savior Catholic Church in Lockport, and the Catholic men's organization, the Knights of Columbus. Pope Paul VI awarded him the Papal Medal. Bollinger remained active in his Gulf Coast marine businesses until his retirement in 1989. Bollinger was married three times, to Doris Toups Bollinger (1913-1986), to Fanella Lalande Bollinger (died 1988) and Patricia Boudreaux Bollinger. He is interred alongside his first wife at Holy Savior Church Cemetery in Lockport. The Donald G. Bollinger Memorial Student Union at Nicholls State University in Thibodaux in Lafourche Parish is named in Bollinger's honor. Donald and Doris Bollinger had two daughters, Charlotte Bollinger (born 1947) and Andrea Bollinger (born c. 1951), one son, Donald Thomas Bollinger, known as \\"Boysie\\" Bollinger (born September 11, 1949), who became the chairman and chief executive officer of Bollinger Shipyards. Boysie Bollinger was a delegate to the 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, and the 2004 Republican National Conventions. However, he was also a supporter of Democrat U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu and cut a television commercial in 2014 for Landrieu in her unsuccessful bid for a fourth term against the Republican U.S. Representative Bill Cassidy of the 6th congressional district, based about Baton Rouge. In 2016, Boysie Bollinger, but not his father, was inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield.

He is known for his decorative paintings in various official buildings and residences in Gdańsk. He also completed commissions for churches and painted facades. He was in 1612 one of the founders of the painters' guild of Gdańsk.Biographical details of Isaak van den Blocke at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Life Vistula grain transport, detail of the Apotheosis of Danzig The details about his early life are scarce. Sources identify his place of birth either as Mechelen in the Southern Netherlands or Königsberg (then in Prussia and today Kaliningrad in Russia). His father was Willem van den Blocke, a Flemish sculptor and architect who had trained with Cornelis Floris in Antwerp. His brother Abraham van den Blocke was an architect and sculptor and his brothers Jacob and David were painters.Biographical details of Willem van den Blocke at The Netherlands Institute for Art History In 1584 the family moved to Danzig (modern Gdańsk, Poland). Here he likely received training by or worked in the workshop of Paul Vredeman de Vries and his father Hans Vredeman de Vries. He was in 1612 one of the founders of the painters' guild of Gdańsk. He was the teacher of Laurence Neter. Van den Blocke died in Danzig around the same time as his father and brother Abraham, likely from an infectious disease. Work Apotheosis of Danzig, detail He was strongly influenced by the Northern Mannerism and the perspectival paintings of his presumed teachers Hans and Paul Vredeman de Vries. He drew his inspiration mainly from the Bible and mythology as well as contemporary subjects. His principal work is the decoration of the ceiling (completed 1608) of the Great Chamber of the former main town hall in Danzig. This work was composed of 25 oil paintings on oak panels, with a central composition, an allegory to the glorious trade of Danzig (Apotheosis of Danzig). He also made paintings for the winter council room of the town hall (1611-1614).Jerzy Kowalczyk and Bożena Steinborn. \\"Izaak van den Blocke.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 26 May 2014 He received regular commissions from the city council, including figure paintings and the polychroming of buildings. He completed several assignments for churches in Danzig including the main altar of St Catherine's Church (together with Anton Möller). The Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, Germany holds a nine-part ceiling painting, which is permanently installed in a ceiling in one of its rooms. It shows allegorical and biblical scenes in three rows of three pictures. Their interpretation is not always clear. Whether the arrangement in the museum reflects the original one remains open.

Some scenes are based on prints by Netherlandish masters. Some of the depictions can be interpreted easily. For example, the scene with Minerva standing behind a man holding a compass personifies the liberal arts. Other paintings in the programme are less obvious.Neunteiliges Deckengemälde mit allegorischen und biblischen Szenen (Gemälde, Leinwandgemälde, Deckenbild) at the Germanisches Nationalmuseum  References  External links * Category:Flemish artists (before 1830) Category:17th-century Polish painters Category:Polish male painters Category:People from Königsberg Category:1574 births Category:1626 deaths Category:Flemish Mannerist painters Category:Polish Mannerist painters ","title":"Isaak van den Blocke"},{"id":"42864968","text":"United Gas Corporation was a major oil company from its inception in 1930 to its hostile takeover and subsequent forced merger with Pennzoil in 1968.United Gas Corp. v.

In 1968, United was merged into Pennzoil, and the firm was renamed Pennzoil United, Inc. The retail gas distribution assets of United were spun off into Entex Energy in 1970. United Gas Pipeline stock was distributed to Pennzoil shareholders in 1974, and that company was eventually restructured as United Energy Resources, Inc., which was, in turn, acquired by Midcon Corporation. Through purchase of Benson- Lehner Corporation of Van Nuys, California, and the Telecomputing Services (TSI) product line of the Whittaker's Data Instruments, North Hollywood, California, which became its fully owned subsidiaries, United Gas was engaged in missile business and various other defense activities related to the U.S. aerospace industry.Mergers and Acquisitions. // Missiles and Rockets, March 22, 1965, v. 16, no. 12, p. 39. In particular, it operated data processing centers for military and civil government agencies, including White Sands Missile Range missile test data analyzing, provided processing services for Strategic Air Command 1st Missile Division at Vandenberg Air Force Base, etc. At the time of its takeover by Pennzoil, United operated the busiest pipeline network in the United States, carrying 8% of the nation's supply, and was eight times the size of its buyer.Forbes, Sept. 15, 1974 p. 54-57 The dramatic takeover, accomplished by a cash tender offer using vast amounts of borrowed money and United's own assets as collateral, was the first of its kind in the United States, and, together with the subsequent asset spin-off, the event is a classic example of the leveraged buyout and corporate raid and resulted in numerous lawsuits and regulatory investigations. Early History and Beginnings The earliest company making up what would be United Gas Corporation entered Shreveport prior to 1915 as The Palmer Corporation of Shreveport, owned by Honore and Potter Palmer of Chicago. The Palmer Corporation sent 22-year-old Canadian Norris Cochran \\"N.C.\\" McGowen to Shreveport to manage its gas wells and short pipeline to Shreveport. McGowen set to work in Vivian, Louisiana. By 1916, McGowen, still operating on behalf of the Palmer Corporation, secured control of a number properties in the newly discovered Monroe Gas Field. McGowen continued to add smaller companies, culminating in the merger of the Palmer Corporation and Electric Power & Light to form the Louisiana Gas and Fuel Company, now having operations in Texas and Mississippi, among other states. Louisiana Gas and Fuel was still, however, a subsidiary of the much larger Electric Bond and Share Company, a company McGowen rapidly rose through the ranks of. United Gas Corporation is Born Edmundson Parkes would join the company in 1928. Then, between 1928 and 1930, McGowen and Parkes combined the assets of five major groups, representing more than 40 power, fuel and utility companies, to form a holding company christened the United Gas Corporation on June 30, 1930. United next entered the Jackson Gas Field, soon controlling most of the gas in that play and recognizing in the Field a cheap source of gas for Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. Through subsidiaries, United began entering and dominating more markets south of Jackson, building out its pipeline along the way. In 1931, in the midst of the Great Depression, United's efforts ended with a monopoly of the Jackson Gas Field, having bought all of Gulf Refining Company's rights, including gas wells and over 14,000 acres of leases for $500,000 and the smaller Pearl Valley Oil & Gas Company's Jackson assets. Now positioned atop the heap and with ready access to cheap natural gas, United offered to buy the Southern Natural Pipeline at considerably below market value. With no way to compete, Southern was forced to sell. United's purchase included miles of pipeline stretching from Jackson, Mississippi to Mobile, Alabama, with an extension to Pensacola, Florida under construction. The company continued to add assets and expand until 1937 when the many entities owned by United Gas were reorganized to form Union Producing Company for exploration and production, Atlas Processing for refining, United Gas Pipeline Company for long-distance transmission, and parent, United Gas Corporation, as the distributor for cities. Through mergers with eight other companies, Atlas Processing Company became one of the largest refineries in the Southern United States.Plummer, Marguerite R. and Joiner, Gary D., Historic Shreveport- Bossier: An Illustrated History of Shreveport and Bossier, p. 53 Historical Publishing Network (San Antonio, TX 2000) The plant is still operational in Shreveport today.Plummer and Joiner, Historic Shreveport-Bossier, p. 53 The company also developed extensive mines and technology through its subsidiaries, Duval Corporation, a miner and miller of copper, potash, sulphur and other materials, and UGC Instruments, a manufacturer of electronic devices primarily used in the oil and gas industry. The company's crown jewel, however, was the extensive pipeline network built out and maintained by United Gas Pipeline Company. Rapid Rise In the 1930s, an FTC investigation revealed that four dominant holding companies controlled 60% of natural gas produced and 58% of total pipeline mileage. One of these big four companies was the United Gas Corporation. On January 19, 1940, United Gas Pipe Line Company became the first pipeline company to handle 1,000,000,000 cubic feet of natural gas in one day. United proved to be a pioneer in the gas delivery industry. To provide raw supplies to its markets, United and its pipeline contractors pioneered the construction of natural-gas gathering lines across marshlands and open water. In 1941, United Gas and Houston firm, Brown & Root built the first large-diameter submarine pipeline, spanning 25 miles across Lake Pontchartrain, near New Orleans. The techniques employed by United and Brown & Root became industry standard. United then turned its attention offshore, extending its pipeline to Eugene Island south of St. Mary Parish. The Louisiana State Office Building in Shreveport was originally the headquarters of the former United Gas Corporation. The Post-World War II era saw United's rise accelerate, as regional markets for cheap natural gas appeared and expanded. By 1947, United Gas was the largest gas company in the Southwest. In that same year, several United employees left the company to form Texas Eastern Transmission Co., including manager, Reginald Hargrove, general counsel, George Naff, and assistant chief engineer, Baxter Goodrich. Texas Eastern became a dominant pipeline player in its own right, and, in exchange for releasing the employees, United was guaranteed another market for its gas production and supply. The close relationship between the two companies would interest the Justice Department over the ensuing years. Hargrove would ultimately perish in a tragic airplane accident, occurring when a seaplane owned by United Gas crashed into the treetops outside of Shreveport during the return from a three-day duck hunting trip hosted by United Gas.Brock, Erick J., Erick Brock's Shreveport, p. 197 (Brock 2001) The crash killed 12 people, including six prominent Shreveporters and Dallas resident Thomas E. Braniff, president of Braniff Airways. Shreveport leaders killed in the crash were Hargrove, financier Justin R. Querbes, Sr., Interstate Electric President Randolph Querbes, Sr., Atlas Processing Chairman John B. Atkins, Sr., Goldring’s Vice President E. Bernard Weiss, and independent oil producer J.P. Evans. Henry Goodrich, another United Gas alumnus employed by subsidiary Union Producing as an exploration geologist, would go on to form Goodrich Petroleum Corporation. On July 6, 1949, United Gas Corporation was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with an initial listing of 10,700,000 shares. By the early 1950s, United Gas owned and operated an extensive pipeline system stretching across the Gulf South. Annual reports indicated that, in 1953, United owned and operated more than 9,000 field and transmission lines that distributed more than 800,000,000,000 cubic feet of natural gas annually to 309 cities, towns, and communities. Of the approximately 18 pipeline systems built in the region, United owned five. Entrance of Pennzoil and Demise Pennzoil was founded in Los Angeles, California in 1913. In 1955, it was acquired by Oil City, Pennsylvania company South Penn Oil, a former branch of Standard Oil. In 1963, South Penn Oil merged with Zapata Petroleum, a company founded by brothers, William Liedtke, Jr. and J. Hugh Liedtke, Thomas J. Devine, and future U.S. President George H.W. Bush. The merged company took the Pennzoil name. Through business associates, Hugh Liedtke became aware of United Gas, by 1965 the nation's busiest pipeline operator, conveying across the country every day, making up 8% of the nation's supply. In researching the company, Liedtke also discovered United's vast oil reserves and large deposits of copper, sulphur, and other materials. United was, however, eight times the size of the fledgling Pennzoil. Undaunted, Pennzoil began slowly accumulating shares of United Gas on the open market. By October 1965, Pennzoil owned 275,000 shares of United common stock which it had acquired under an investment program initiated in May 1965. Word of a possible takeover leaked, however, and shares of United Gas soared. Then, Pennzoil hit upon a method for acquiring United in one fell swoop, the cash tender offer, a practice unheard of in the United States but widely used in the United Kingdom. The move would cement the Liedtkes' legacy in the oil and gas industry, and result in Bush's Pennzoil stock increasing in value 10,000%. Accordingly, on November 22, 1965, Pennzoil made a public offer to the United common stockholders to purchase a minimum of 1,000,000 shares of United common stock at $41 per share. As of that date, United was selling at $35.75 on the open market. Liedtke, according to The Wall Street Journal, waited until the day before Thanksgiving to make the unwelcome offer, \\"knowing that many United executives would be off for the long weekend duck hunting\\". United's management was indeed caught off-guard, and, although leadership advised against the tender, the response to the Pennzoil offer was much greater than anticipated. By December 7, 1965, 4,982,096 out of the 12,868,982 shares outstanding had been tendered to Pennzoil, with additional shares continuing to be tendered. Because of the volume of shares tendered, Pennzoil was forced to arrange over $200,000,000 in debt financing, using United's own assets as collateral. When the dust cleared, and although United fought Pennzoil every step of the way, Pennzoil owned 42% of United Gas Corporation with well over $1,000,000,000 in revenues. The takeover was cited as a textbook example of a corporate raid and was described as \\"an aggressive Lilliputian capturing a sleeping giant,\\" and \\"the minnow swallowing the whale.La. Power & Light Co. v. United Gas Pipeline Company, 478 So.2d 1240, 1246 (La. Ct. App. 1985) http://leagle.com/decision/19851718478So2d1240_11415.xml/LA.%20POWER%20&%20LIGHT%20CO.%20v.%20UNITED%20GAS%20PIPE%20LINE%20CO. Aftermath Pennzoil then deposed the old Board of Directors of both United Gas Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary, United Gas Pipeline Company, appointing Hugh Liedtke as Chairman of the Board and William Liedtke as Chairman of the Executive Committee. The Executive Committee consisted of Messrs. Boviard, Everett, Haslanger, Kerr, Hugh Liedtke, William Liedtke, and Edmundson Parkes. These new board members, most of whom were also directors of Pennzoil, constituted a majority of both boards. From that point on, Pennzoil exercised ultimate control over the actions of United Gas Corporation and United Gas Pipeline Company. In April 1968, Pennzoil compelled a merger of United and Pennzoil, forming Pennzoil United, Inc. In December 1968 Pennzoil forced United Gas Pipeline Company to pay a dividend of $51,000,000 to its new owner. Pennzoil proceeded to sell off most of United's assets, first spinning off its retail business and then, in 1974, the huge United Gas Pipe Line Company. The Liedtkes' handling of the affair resulted in a barrage of lawsuits and an investigation by the Federal Power Commission. The absorption of the United companies turned Pennzoil into a large and diversified natural- resources company. Its 1970 sales hit $700 million, up tenfold from 1963, and its Duval Corporation mining subsidiary went on to make a series of quick strikes in sulphur, potash, copper, gold, and silver.

This case also is notable that it extends legal relationships to include creditors to the same entity. Background Hindsbank owned a farm in South Canterbury, with Equiticorp holding a first ranking debenture over the company assets. Burbery had a first ranking charge over the farm machinery of Hindsbank. Hindsbank got into financial difficulty, resulting Burbery trying to repossess the farm equipment, as well as Equiticorp appointing a receiver. The receiver discussed over the phone with Burbery, that as he was instructed to sell the farm, he asked Burbery to not repossess the farm machinery. Burbery alleged that the receiver also said that this was to maximise the sale proceeds for the farm, although the receiver denied ever saying this. As a result of this conversation, Burbery instructed their repossession agent to cease seizing the machinery. However, unknown to Burbery at the time, the receiver had discovered that they could legally seize the machinery under a Warrant to Distrain for unpaid rent. The receiver subsequently sold the machinery and refused to pay any of the sale proceeds to Burbery. A less than impressed Burbery sued Hindsbank to recover the sale proceeds. Held The Court of Appeal extended the necessary pre existing legal relationship to include parties that were creditors to the same company. The court ruled that the only reasonable conclusion of the conversation that it would not affect Burbery's security and that if Hindsbank wanted to distrain the farm machinery, equity would require that Hindsbank give Burbery reasonable notice of this. As a result, promissory estoppel applied, and the receiver was ordered to pay to Burbery the proceeds from the machinery sale.

The first version ran from the 5th Street Bridge at the Georgia- South Carolina state line near Augusta, Georgia, to Aiken, Leesville, and Lexington, South Carolina before ending in West Columbia. Today, this route is marked as US 1 from the state line to West Columbia, which was assigned the route in 1927. SC 12 was dropped from the route in 1928, the year afterwards. The second former route of SC 12 was established between 1928 and 1931. The route ran from what is now US 521 between Lancaster and Fort Mill for to the North Carolina state line near Waxhaw, North Carolina, at what was then NC 25\\\\. In 1934, North Carolina changed NC 25 to NC 75, and South Carolina renumbered SC 12 to SC 75 four years later, in 1938. =Current designation= Major intersections Special routes =West Columbia connector route= South Carolina 12 Connector (SC 12 Conn.) follows 9th Street in West Columbia from U.S. Route 1 (US 1; Meeting Street) to US 378 (Sunset Boulevard). It is long and has an interchange with SC 12 at its midpoint. =Columbia spur route= South Carolina 12 Spur (SC 12 Spur) is a extension of Forest Drive from SC 12 to the entrance of Fort Jackson within the city limits of Columbia. It has one intersection with shopping centers' access roads before an interchange with Interstate 77 (I-77) at its exit 12. Past I-77, the road name becomes Strom Thurmond Boulevard and ends at Fort Jackson's Gate 2.

He originally formed Intuition Games with Iowa State University classmate Mike Boxleiter in 2007 where they worked on Dinowaurs and other small Adobe Flash games. Trained as an artist, Wohlwend worked mainly on the visual assets. As Mikengreg, they released Solipskier (2010, iOS), whose success let the two take a more experimental approach with Gasketball, which did not fare as well. At the same time, Wohlwend collaborated with Asher Vollmer to make Puzzlejuice, and with Adam Saltsman to make Hundreds based on Wohlwend's first game design. He later released Threes! with Vollmer in 2014 to critical acclaim. His later games TouchTone and TumbleSeed were also the products of collaborations. Wohlwend was named among Forbes' 2014 \\"30 under 30\\" in the games industry.  Career  Animation of app icons designed by Wohlwend Wohlwend studied graphic design at Iowa State University and graduated in 2008. He has described his aesthetic as \\"simple and elegant\\", and has said about his practice that he is not good at character design and that he prefers to work with vector file formats in Adobe Illustrator so that the images can work at all resolutions. Wohlwend also feels that creativity is a skill that is cultivated and not inborn. He has been influenced by his lifelong experience playing video games, and his favorite game is Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn. His writings on the lifestyle required for indie development have been noted by games journalists. Wohlwend was named among Forbes' 2014 \\"30 under 30\\" in the games industry. = Intuition and Mikengreg = Wohlwend met Mike Boxleiter in an experimental video game development class they took together at Iowa State University. Wohlwend had attempted to help Boxleiter with a project, but quit after drawing a few aliens. They met again as coworkers at the university's Virtual Reality Application Center during Boxleiter's final year of college. Upon discovering their close interests, they began to work on an Adobe Flash game named Dinowaurs while they completed college. So as to make money while they worked on the game, they founded Intuition Games at the university's Research Park around May 2007. They decided to stay in Ames, Iowa due to its financial feasibility and local connections, but two other team members (friends from Iowa State) lived farther away. They saw Flash games as an easy entry point into full-time self-employment, but planned to eventually work on console platforms such as WiiWare. Boxleiter In their development process, Boxleiter and Wohlwend both proposed and worked on each other's ideas, and would drop the ideas they found unexciting. Wohlwend said they often argued over aspects of their games, which he found normal and natural. Their labor as a team was divided in that Wohlwend always did the art and Boxleiter the programming, as reflective of their skills at the time. The pair agreed to an assessment of their partnership as \\"left-brain right-brain\\", and saw the majority of their joint work as \\"editing\\". Aside from the business aspects, they were grateful to have the \\"creative freedom\\" to do their own work. Wohlwend appreciated the benefits of not doing contract work, but struggled with the relative \\"isolation\\" of having few colleagues, a low salary, and job instability. He disagreed with the \\"cinematic action games\\" he saw to be popular at the time and hoped to contribute more compelling ideas to the young industry. They thought of themselves as artists and of their work as experimental. Boxleiter and Wohlwend worked long hours when making the Flash games, which they found exciting and unsustainable. At Intuition, they worked on games such as Dinowaurs, Gray, Fig. 8, and Lifecraft and participated in at least six game jams. As of April 2010, they had created 10 games together. Intuition's first game, Dinowaurs, is a Flash-based strategy and action game where two players compete as dinosaurs to seize the most cavemen settlements so as to upgrade their own capacity and eventually kill the other dinosaur. It features online matchmaking. The concept came from one of Boxleiter's unfinished projects and another Intuition member's drawing of a stegosaurus with a jetpack. The team was funded then-new Flash site Kongregate by November 2007 as one of the first five games for Kongregate platform. It was finished in two years for a 2009 release. IndieGames.com reported mixed reviews from players. Their later games would only take a few months each, in comparison. They abandoned the use of design documents after Dinowaurs, and instead chose to refine and experiment in process. Intuition released Effing Hail and Gray around April 2009. Players in action game Effing Hail control hail and wind to destroy the most buildings and midair objects within a time limit. The game was published through Kongregate. In Gray, players control a single character and try to end a riot by influencing other individuals in the crowd. The game was featured at IndieCade in 2009. In the case of Fig. 8., Wohlwend thought of the idea based on a college art project. In the project, Wohlwend followed a bike trail in the snow, metaphorically related it to the tribulations of romantic relationship, and made an art installation involving a bike spray-painted black with two errant red and blue tracks painted on the floor. The concept went unused on their whiteboard for four months until they needed an idea, whereupon Boxleiter added game mechanics to the visuals. In their next game, Liferaft, the player-character is a young woman set to escape \\"a post- apocalyptic sci-fi ... test chamber\\", with core gameplay that revolves around a \\"Bionic Commando-style grappling hook\\". Wohlwend used a 16-bit era graphics style. They sought crowdfunding from Kickstarter, but later canceled and put the project on hiatus in October 2009. In March 2010, and under the moniker Mikengreg, Boxleiter and Wohlwend's 4fourths was selected for Kokoromi's Gamma IV showcase. Based on the showcase's \\"one button game\\" theme, four players control two spaceships using one button apiece to cooperatively destroy enemy ships. It was Michael Rose of IndieGame.com favorite game of the Gamma IV selections, was later displayed at the 2010 Game Developers Conference and in Brandon Boyer's 2011 Wild Rumpus event. Mikengreg announced Liferaft: Zero and Solipskier in November 2010. The former is a \\"prequel teaser\\" to Liferaft: a game of trial-based challenges with wall-jumping and grappling wherein girl clones attempt to swing and jump around test chambers to reach and ring a bell. Wohlwend and Boxleiter made the shorter version to limit the scope creep of the overall project. IndieGames.com named the Flash game their third best browser platformer of the year. Their other game, 4fourths, was put on hiatus for lack of resources. They were interested in making games outside the Flash market. = Solipskier = Wohlwend's Solipskier high score run Their first game as Mikengreg was the sport-inspired Solipskier, where the player's finger draws the ground for the on-screen skier to pass through a level filled with gates, tunnels, and walls. It was designed as a Flash game, which set the limitations for its mechanics. The game concept came from a brainstorming session about parallax scrolling, and was revised in fits of creativity. They paired the parallax scrolling with speed and began to prototype. Wohlwend saved the skier's character design for last since he felt it was his weakest area. Mikengreg then decided to develop for iOS in addition to Flash, and to release both versions simultaneously. It was released simultaneously for Kongregate (Flash) and iOS on August 29, 2010. Solipskier became their first game to receive public appreciation. The iOS version made around $70,000 in its first two months (as compared to $15,000 from the Flash release), which gave them enough stability to branch out into non-Flash platforms. = Gasketball = Gasketball icon Riding the earnings from Solipskier, Mikengreg continued to pay themselves their same salary but now had the means to try new ideas. Wohlwend estimated that they discarded about six \\"fairly polished prototypes\\" over the development of their next game, Gasketball. They were able to live on $20–25,000 a year each in Iowa for the next two years while working on the new game. Wohlwend made somewhat more income due to other collaborations, such as Puzzlejuice with Asher Vollmer, but shared his income with Boxleiter. Even though Solipskier was successful, the duo did not have a following comparable to indie developers like Team Meat and thus felt like their external pressure was low. Instead, their pressure was internal. Wohlwend said he worked 100-hour weeks with no weekends or vacations while living off of the Solipskier funds. In making Gasketball, Boxleiter and Wohlwend felt that their game quality had improved continually, but found the idea of a million-person audience \\"daunting\\". Wohlwend questioned whether he could even recreate Solipskier success. When they ran out of money, Boxleiter borrowed money from his parents, and eventually they both went homeless, living off of the couches of friends. Gasketball was released for iPad on August 9, 2012. They had decided to release the game as an ethically non- coercive free-to-play game, with a free base game and in-app purchases for the extended content. Not as many players paid for the content as expected. This was due, in part, to the players' difficulty in finding the purchase function. The game had been downloaded 200,000 times in its August 2012 launch week and was briefly ranked near the top of an iTunes top downloads ranking, though it did not break the top 200 grossing chart. = Puzzlejuice = Wohlwend began to collaborate with Asher Vollmer when Vollmer reached out to Wohlwend for aesthetic advice on a game he was designing, Puzzlejuice. The game has been compared to a cross between Boggle, Tetris, and tile-matching, where tetromino blocks fall from the top of the screen that players turn into letters and rearrange into words. Wohlwend and Vollmer communicated nonverbally through the entire development process via a 365-message email chain. Vollmer served as the game's programmer, Wohlwend as the artist, and Jimmy Hinson as the composer. Puzzlejuice was selected for the PAX 10, a spotlighted group of indie games, in July 2012. It was released as a universal app for iPhone and iPad on January 19, 2012. = Hundreds = Upon finishing his role as artist on Solipskier, Wohlwend wanted to experiment with game programming by designing his own game. He developed Hundreds from an idea he had while staring at a ceiling, where he imagined a circle growing without overlapping another when growing. He found this to be a good core game concept and based the game around \\"patience and persistence\\". The game's style inadvertently borrowed from his first year in art school, where Wohlwend composed in black, white, and red so as to focus on composition rather than color. While Wohlwend's design style is \\"simple and elegant\\", the game's minimalism was also functional due to his inexperience with programming. The code was \\"brute forced\\" and written in a single file. He finished Hundreds as a Flash game in 2010, but when Flash sites were not interested in purchasing it, Wohlwend chose to open source the code (partly with the intent to spur \\"non-coders\\" to try coding, as he had). This version is available online at Newgrounds. At a lull in-between projects, programmer Eric Johnson of Semi Secret Software found the open source code and ported the game to iPad in a weekend before notifying Wohlwend. At the time, Wohlwend did not have an iOS device to test the port, and had to purchase an iPad. Johnson's iPad version spurred Wohlwend to consider how Hundreds would work with multitouch and cooperative play, and Semi Secret's Adam Saltsman to consider a Hundreds collaborative iOS release. The project was intended to be a quick level expansion, but quickly surpassed its several month estimate. Wohlwend and Saltsman extended the game's mechanics with new circles and puzzles, and many of their implemented ideas were later removed. Wohlwend was happy with the final result and credited the game's \\"emergent interaction\\" qualities to Saltsman. They built on each other's level designs, though Wohlwend said that Saltsman made \\"basically all the levels\\". The new team enjoyed working with each other. In Hundreds, players touch circles to make them grow without overlapping. There are 100 puzzles that increase in complexity. The Flash version was much simpler in design, and added circles onscreen as the game progressed. The iOS version added a new gameplay mode and a narrative element based on ciphers and codes, and was released on January 7, 2013 for iPhone and iPad, and later for Android. It was nominated for several Independent Games Festival awards, and The Atlantic critic Ian Bogost wrote that the game functioned like a design object, a feat unique for the video game medium. = Ridiculous Fishing = Wohlwend produced the art for Vlambeer's Ridiculous Fishing. The four-person teamVlambeer designer Jan Willem Nijman and marketer Rami Ismail alongside iOS developer Zach Gagewas described by games journalists as an \\"indie supergroup\\" and a \\"dream team\\". In Ridiculous Fishing, the player uses motion and touch controls to catch fish and consequently shoot them out of the sky for cash. The game is known for its developers' battle against a cloned version of their game released by another company. The team worked separately and sporadically with little progress as disheartened by their cloned game predicament, until an August 2012 road trip home across the United States from Penny Arcade Expo in Seattle to New York City convinced the team to set a deadline. They scrapped \\"90 percent\\" of their work, and Wohlwend moved to New York City to live with Gage and work 14-hour days during the final weeks. The last parts of Ridiculous Fishing assembled smoothly and it was released March 14, 2013, for iOS and later that year for Android. It was well received at launch with \\"near-universal perfect scores\\" and won both a 2013 Apple Design Award and Apple's iPhone game of the year. While IGN's Justin Davis thought the game's levels could have been more differentiated in theme and art style, he found the \\"almost cubist design ... absolutely gorgeous\\". Welsh of Eurogamer agreed that Wohlwend's art was \\"achingly cool\\" and reflected a \\"retro and minimalist\\" indie gaming trend without overpowering the gameplay. = Threes! = Wohlwend, Vollmer, and Hinson of Puzzlejuice collaborated again on Threes!, a game where the player slides numbered tiles on a four-by-four grid to combine addends and multiples of three. Its development began before Ridiculous Fishing March 2013 release. Vollmer presented an idea similar to the final product in its simplicity: pair tiles as multiples of three. The first prototype was written in a single night. Vollmer and Wohlwend spent at least half a year of the game's 14-month development iterating on this main idea. Early Threes designs had no inclination towards minimalism: the pair felt that the game needed to appear more complex so as to interest players. Wohlwend sent Vollmer designs with themes such as sushi, chess, broccoli and cheese soup, and hydrogen atoms, which confused their test audiences. They received a \\"wake-up call\\" from fellow game designer Zach Gage, who encouraged them to return from their foray into complexity. The final game returned to its original theme of numbers. Speaking in retrospect, Wohlwend said the game \\"always wanted to be simple\\". He noted that players \\"think math\\" upon seeing the game's numbers, though the game is more about \\"spatial relationships\\" and just happens to have a \\"number theme\\". When returning to the fundamental and original game conceptpairing tiles as multiples of threethe developers felt their experiments informed their final game development decisions. The theme of individual tile personalities extended to the final version, as tiles have faces and express emotions when paired. For example, the 384 tile has a pirate personality with a large tooth and a pirate eyepatch. Of the development process, Wohlwend called it \\"tough and frustrating and sometimes hard to see if it was worth it\\". It was released for iOS on February 6, 2014 and later ported to Android, with an Xbox One version announced as in development. The game received what video game review score aggregator Metacritic described as \\"universal acclaim\\". Eurogamer and TouchArcade awarded the game perfect scores, with the latter calling Threes \\"about as close as it gets to a perfect mobile game\\". Re/code reported that it \\"dominated\\" the chart in the following weeks and became one of the 25 highest grossing apps on the App Store. It later won a 2014 Apple Design Award. = TouchTone = After Gasketball 2012 release, Boxleiter and Wohlwend planned a celebratory road trip to a game jam in Victoria, British Columbia. The game did not fare as expected, so Boxleiter used the two-day jam to create the core mirror reflection mechanics of what would become TouchTone, though it would take two years of sporadic work to finalize the remainder of the game. In TouchTone, the player monitors phone calls as part of a government surveillance program to find public threats. The story is told through a series of reflection puzzles wherein the player swipes the screen to reflect a beam around a room to its intended destination. Mikengreg felt that their first theme of light, prisms, and audio signal too closely mimicked \\"a hacking minigame from a bigger AAA game like BioShock or System Shock\\", but eventually paired the concept with a satirical Edward Snowden theme following the mid-2013 global surveillance disclosures. Their original efforts were jocular, but their concept became more serious as the story and \\"political message\\" grew deeper. Boxleiter wrote most of the script, and together with Wohlwend, would conference after each chapter for coherency. Mikengreg decided against including an option to skip puzzles, which they felt would spoil the game and the player's capacity to adapt to increasing difficulty. They called this philosophy the \\"Derek Yu (of Spelunky) school of game design\\". TouchTone was released on March 19, 2015 for iOS. Review aggregator Metacritic characterized its reviews as generally favorable. = TumbleSeed = Wohlwend and the TumbleSeed development team Wohlwend's friend Benedict Fritz developed a prototype of a mechanical arcade game from a bar that they frequented in Chicago. When Wohlwend saw the video of Ice Cold Beer online, they began work on an open world, dungeon crawl version of the game, which became TumbleSeed. They also worked through a Cards Against Humanity game incubation program in 2015, and several other indie developers based in Chicago joined the production. Based on the project's loose, collaboratory nature, Metro called the game's pedigree \\"as indie as indie gaming gets\\". With the announcement of the Nintendo Switch, the development team sought to become a \\"flagship\\" demonstration of the console's HD Rumble feature, in which the player proprioceptively \\"feels\\" in-game textures through the controller's fine-tuned vibrations. They cold-called Nintendo and began work together in June 2016, prior to the Switch's announcement. TumbleSeed was released on May 2, 2017, on Nintendo Switch, macOS, PlayStation 4, and Windows platforms. The developers credited the game's tepid critical reception and associated stigma of intense difficulty for the game's slow sales. While Wohlwend hoped that a post-release patch would resolve some of these issues, he did not expect the game to recoup its costs, though the team was proud of their product.

In Solipskier, the player draws the snowy slope for an on-screen skier to pass through slalom gates and tunnels. The character accelerates with downhill sections and can launch into the air to perform tricks and earn a higher score. The idea came from a brainstorming session about parallax scrolling with speedy action in the foreground and the ability for the player to \\"paint\\" the terrain. It was Boxleiter and Wohlwend's first game to receive public appreciation. It was released August 29, 2010 to generally favorable reviews and was a runner-up in the 2011 Game Developers Conference Independent Games Festival's Best Mobile Game category.  Gameplay  In the sports game Solipskier, the player draws the ground for the on-screen skier to pass through a level filled with gates, tunnels, and walls. Drawing an incline, for example, will launch the skier into the air to perform tricks, and a downhill section will accelerate the skier. Upcoming obstacles are indicated at the right of the screen along with the necessary altitude and distance. A streak of successful passes through gates will accrue a bonus score. The skier's speed also increases with time. As an endless runner (compared to Canabalt), the characters advance until they die, as there is no end. If the skier travels fast enough, he loses his headphones, which cuts out the background music to the sound of the wind passing by. The player receives \\"All Star Dunk Contest-like scorecards\\" after landing big jumps. Solipskier also has an online leaderboard, and offers tips for new players to improve their scores. It focuses on style and emotion from the player-character's terminal speed rather than on jumps and tricks. It also has a hard rock guitar soundtrack.  Development  Solipskier was designed for the Adobe Flash platform. Michael Boxleiter and Greg Wohlwend had worked on Flash games earlier as Intuition Games. The idea for the game came from a brainstorming session about parallax scrolling, and was revised in fits of creativity. They paired the parallax scrolling with speed, and eventually Boxleiter \\"blurted out with wide-eyes\\" that the player could \\"paint the terrain to determine the speed of the character\\". They chose a snow or snowmobile theme and began to prototype that same night. Boxleiter used skills he had acquired from previous games (heightmaps from Dinowaurs and bitmap drawing from EON) to make a mockup within hours: a red ball that moved along with a slope (made with the mouse) and floated down slowly when suspended in air. He added three gates to create a slalom skiing course and a sense of distance and speed, which was not apparent otherwise. Boxleiter then set up indicators to show the incoming gates, though he thought it was odd to have the indicators move to the right as the gate moved to towards the player (to the left). There was no parallax scrolling implemented in this phase. Meanwhile, Wohlwend mocked up a 2D course in grayscale, with humps of mountains. He originally designed the visuals such that there would be nothing on the screen where the player had not painted, which was later cut. After seeing Boxleiter's draft, he used crisp colors to make distinct gate markers and made the foreground highly contrast with the background. Their early drafts had a nighttime theme and included an aurora that was later cut due to difficulty of implementation in Flash. Wohlwend left the character design for last as his \\"weak point\\". Boxleiter was particularly inspired by the idea of a skier replacing the snowmobile, and set up the parallax scrolling and motion blur, which made the skier appear to go faster. He also added the \\"tunnel\\" idea as a series of gates. They animated the skier, who they gave an \\"ego-tastic\\" large head on a stick figure body, and decided to not use tutorials, opting for a game that began with the player's first click. Wohlwend's rainbow trail effect was added as a scarf or cape (which later became a rainbow burst behind the player), and the scoring mechanics were refined to reward players who took risks by letting the skier fly through the air without touching the screen. This was partly inspired by the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series. The title refers to a combination of solipsism and skiing. The game was their first to receive public appreciation. Boxleiter first understood its potential when publishers fought for the bid to the game. At the time, it was solely designed for Flash and not iOS, though they were interested in making bigger games outside the Flash market. They announced the game in mid August 2010, where they revealed that the game would release on Flash (through Kongregate) and iOS simultaneously, which happened on August 29, 2010. Joe Bergeron, a programmer who had previously worked on Dinowaurs with Mikengreg, helped with the iOS version of the game. Solipskier made around $70,000 in its first two months (as compared to $15,000 from the Flash release), which let them work in other non-Flash mediums in the future. They released an Android version three months later.  Reception  The game received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic. It was a runner-up in the 2011 Game Developers Conference Independent Games Festival's Best Mobile Game category. IGN Levi Buchanan praised the art direction, especially the rainbow scarf against the gray, monotone background. Chris Hall of 148Apps called it \\"the most original since Fastar\\". Hall praised the touch of having the headphones fall off, with the contrast between the hard rock guitar and the rushing natural wind, but criticized the complex scoring system. Edge Chris Donlan, on the other hand, appreciated the trade-offs between the different opportunities to score higher. Hall of 148Apps added that Solipskier did not look as great on a Retina Display. Tim Rattray of Slide to Play called the graphics \\"pure eye candy\\". He felt that the game was \\"unique, but a 'one-trick pony' combination of fast Canabalt and platform-drawing Line Racer\\". Likewise, IndieGames.com felt Solipskier novelty was ephemeral. Pocket Gamer Mark Brown called its difficulty \\"steeper than the Alps\\". Pocket Gamer listed the game as one of the toughest and best indie games in 2011, one of the best endless runners in 2012, and a \\"hidden gem\\" in 2013.

After 15 years of preparatory and construction work, the power plant went into commercial operation on 10 December 2011. Dam and reservoir The power plant was established from the construction of concrete gravity dam at an altitude of 545 meters along the Hoping River basin in Hualien County. The dam at () created a reservoir with a capacity of 635,000 m3. An intake valve was built connecting the dam with a 6,549 meter long headrace tunnel to Bihai Power Plant located at the downstream side at an altitude of 100 meters where a vertical Pelton turbine of 61.2 MW is installed. Generation The power plant is expected to generate 237 GWh every year to residents of Hualien County to relieve the previous burden for Taipower to import electricity from Mingtan Pumped Storage Hydro Power Plant in Nantou County and Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant in Pingtung County which was very costly. The 18 hours of daily water capture and storage will generate enough electricity to supply the six hours of peak load in the region.

The first incarnation of the show was hosted by veteran actress and Philippine Red Cross member Rosa Rosal and William Thio, which first ran on ABS-CBN from October 20, 1969 until it closed down on September 21, 1972 as a telethon, and was revived on December 1, 1975 and aired on GTV (which later became MBS, NBN and PTV) until November 20, 2010, after merely 35 years. The second incarnation of the show premiered on PTV on October 6, 2017 and now airs every Fridays. It was hosted by Thio, and new host Emilie Katigbak.http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/631406/rosa-bids-damayan- goodbyehttp://www.manunuri.com/natatanging_gawad_urian_kay_rosa_rosal The show tackles different informative subjects and solutions that surely helps not just the viewers but also the real people especially those who are in need. History =ABS-CBN Era (1969–1972)= Ms. Rosa Rosal in the 1970s is a famous and devoted public servant. Her vision is to help people, especially those who are in an impoverished state. In order to keep her public service whole, she organized a television program so it could be spread to those who are in need. Damayan was premiered in October 1969 at its first home on ABS- CBN Channel 2. Back then, it was the only public service program in the entire country. It started as a telethon to raise money to be donated for the victims of Typhoon Isang. Numerous stars back then participated in this program until it became popular and the show's run has been extended. The show ceased airing on September 22, 1972, after the closure of the network due to implementation of Martial Law. =Revival to Channel 4 (1975–2010)= During the Martial Law years, Ms. Rosal continued her work in the Red Cross, vowing to never give up her lifelong service to the general public, even though the entire government controlled almost everything in the country. She went back to the television industry and on December 1, 1975, she hosted the public service program Kapwa Ko Mahal Ko together with future Senator and Defense Secretary Orly Mercado and Dr. Antonio Tulasan, on GMA Network, wherein the show received great reception. When Rosal was on the perk of hosting the show, she decided to revive her old show in her brand new home. Damayan once again premiered on the same year on GTV Channel 4 (which later became MBS, PTV and NBN) to provide humanitarian work, through national television together with her co-host and pinch hitter (whenever Rosal isn't around) William Thio. Aside from providing public service in the show, it showed some numerous insights and talks about health, since Rosal interviewed mostly doctors. When their discussions are through, she would even provide medical assistance since that is her commitment. Even though she had a hectic schedule due to numerous shows she's in—such as her drama anthology Ulila in government-owned network BBC-2 from 1976 to 1980 and Kapwa Ko Mahal Ko on GMA—these particular shows earned Rosal numerous citations such as the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Public Service in 1999, Order of the Golden Heart in 2006, and the Ading Fernando Lifetime Achievement Award in the 22nd PMPC Star Awards for TV.http://www.manunuri.com/natatanging_gawad_urian_kay_rosa_rosalhttp://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/262006/cbb/rosa- rosal-is-the-2012-u-p-gawad-plaridel-awardee =Rosal's final telecast, life after Damayan (2010-2017)= After merely 35 continuous years in the airwaves, Rosal announced that she would be leaving the show and so it ended on November 20, 2010.http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/631406/rosa-bids-damayan- goodbye/ The executives of Channel 4 decided to not revive the show, due to the reason that if there would be another Damayan, it wouldn't be complete without Ms. Rosal. Currently, she still works in the Philippine Red Cross as its ambassador and one of its official Board of Governors. =Revival as Damayan Ngayon (2017-2019)= After a 7-year hiatus, PTV 4 is set to revive the program as Damayan Ngayon, hosted by Emilie Katigbak and William Thio, beginning Friday, October 6, 2017, right after Sentro Balita. Concept and legacy Damayan featured mostly doctors and other personalities to discuss further on the welfare of health and in public service. Usually, Rosal would interview them and they would have a live discussion about a certain topic. It also hosted telethons to provide financial aid to those who are in need such as typhoon victims, those with no medical assistance and others to name a few.http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/631406/rosa-bids-damayan- goodbyehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHZDV_tt51A Damayan has inspired most of the Filipino people, because the show never gives up in providing service, to those who are in need. Numerous organizations recognized the show for its core values and its never-ending mission.

Background and early life Wrong was the grandson of Liberal Party leader Edward Blake and son of historian George MacKinnon Wrong. At age five he suffered the loss of an eye in an accident.Jack Granatstein (1982) Ottawa's Men, Oxford University Press Hume Wrong graduated from high school at Ridley College and was a graduate of the University of Toronto where he joined The Kappa Alpha Society. During the First World War, Wrong served in the British Expeditionary Force where he was sent to the front before being invalided. After the war, he attended the University of Oxford for graduate study, and in 1921 became a history professor at the University of Toronto. Hume was one of five siblings: educator, Margaret Christian Wrong (1887–1948); historian, Oxford academic, and Magdalene College Don, Edward Murray Wrong (1889–1928); British Army officer, Harold Verschoyle Wrong (born 1891, killed in action July 1, 1916, at the Battle of the Somme); and Agnes Honoria Wrong (1903–1995). Diplomatic appointments In April 1927 he became First Secretary to Vincent Massey, head of the Canadian Embassy in Washington, DC. Wrong joined the newly expanded Canadian Department of External Affairs around the same time as fellow future star diplomats Lester Pearson, Norman Robertson, and Hugh Keenleyside; this expansion was engineered by Oscar D. Skelton. Shadow of Heaven: The Life of Lester Pearson, volume 1, by John English, London 1990, Vintage publishers Wrong served in the League of Nations and in 1938 he represented Canada at the Évian Conference. In 1941 he went to Washington when Leighton McCarthy was made Ambassador, then 71 years old. That made Hume the de facto head of the delegation for Canada in Washington, performing such duties as implementation of the Ogdensburg Agreement. He articulated the principle of functionalism in 1942 as follows: :The principle, I think, is that each member of the grand alliance should have a voice in the conduct of the war proportionate to its contribution to the general war effort. A subsidiary principle is that the influence of the various countries should be greatest in connection with those matters with which they are most directly concerned. The placement of C. D. Howe on the Combined Production and Resources Board, and of other seats on the Combined Food Board, were evidence of the practice of functionalism. In the estimation of Jack Granatstein, \\"Canada’s massive war effort, coupled with its tough advocacy of the functionalism principle, made it one of the leaders of the middle powers for a few years during and after the war.\\" In 1946 Hume Wrong was appointed the Ambassador for Canada and he remained in the post until 1953. He was one of the key architects of the North Atlantic Treaty, which would give rise to NATO. He later rose to become the Canadian Undersecretary of External Affairs and was named undersecretary to NATO, but died before he could take up the post.

Shakeela is an orphan who has failed her driving test 14 times. The driving instructor is constantly irritated by Shakeela's antics during the journey to Mussoorie but soon falls in love with her. At Mussoorie, he learns from Pooran that Shakeela is to be delivered to Daksha Bhai (Rahul Dev), an upper-caste landlord from an Uttarakhand village. He delivers Shakeela to Daksha and is invited to stay at his ancestral mansion for a festival. During the stay, he finds out why Shakeela has been delivered to Daksha: Shakeela is the doppelgänger of Daksha Bhai's sister Gadgi Moi (Samantha Ruth Prabhu), a cruel, merciless upper-caste leader who has been sentenced to death for orchestrating a massacre against the lower-caste people. Daksha Bhai plans to send Shakeela to jail in the place of Gadgi, who has been released on parole to perform the last rites of her dead grandmother. The plan backfires as Shakeela escapes from the police. In the chaos that ensues, Gadgi breaks her cover and kidnaps Shakeela, planning to kill her in a moving train. The driving instructor manages to rescue Shakeela and kill Gadgi. Daksha, distraught at Gadgi's death, commits suicide by jumping off the train with her body. In the end, the driving instructor and Shakeela, who are now in a relationship, happily drive back to Chennai. During the journey, the driving instructor whispers his real name in Shakeela's ear, to which she reacts in a disgusting manner.

While all the song lyrics were written by Madhan Karky, Mani Amudhavan penned both the male and female versions of the title track \\"10 Endrathukulla\\". Sony Music acquired the audio rights of the film and subsequently for legal purchase as a soundtrack on digital music platform, iTunes. The first track \\"Vroom Vroom\\" is penned by Madhan Karky, and rendered by Santhosh Hariharan, with backing vocals by D. Imman. The song is termed as a racy bike ride with this eerie number supported well by thumping rhythm and amazing bass guitar. The vocal renders the tune with supreme confidence and mastery. Here is a James Bond from Tamil Nadu musically presented in style by Imman-which happened never before! One will be surprised to find Indian musical instruments like Sitar and Mrudangam effortlessly fusing in this mélange.

In Australia, the television show Countdown began playing the video clip, and exploited the British ban on playing the song. Over several months, Jones became a sensation and a sex symbol. The song was released as a single by EMI Records and spent eight weeks at number one on the singles chart from December 1976. 1980 Song for Europe Contest In 1980, Jones fronted a mainly female band (with Flinn on lead guitar) that adopted her previous stage name of Pussyfoot, and the group entered the Song for Europe 1980 contest (a preamble to the Eurovision Song Contest).

Music maestro Ilaiyaraaja scored the music and V. Nagendra Prasad wrote the lyrics for the songs. The film released on 28 May 2010 across Karnataka and set high expectations for its storyline, music and also some controversies. However upon release, the film generally met with negative reviews from the critics and audience. Plot Sanjana (Aindrita) suddenly wakes up to know that she was murdered in her previous birth. She musters up courage to fight a case and seek justice to her murder through a lawyer. She finds a struggling lawyer Bharadwaj (Prajwal) who has a striking resemblance to her lover in her previous birth. She hires him to fight her case and offers him huge amount even if he lost the case. They take up the case to fight against an MLA (Avinash) who was the Chief Minister earlier responsible for her death. What happens to her case and who wins forms the rest of the story.

He had said that the story had flashed to his mind during his engineering study days and was keeping on working on it. He said that actor Prajwal was having two different get-ups, one being a lawyer role. Shooting was initially scheduled for a straight 72 days but the team finished well within 58 days. During the shooting process, since the days clashed with the general elections, the team had to shift to Hyderabad's Ramoji Rao Studios to complete some sequences. However, the film got entangled in controversies such as actress Aindrita not attending the promotional campaigns since she alleged that she was not paid as promised by the producer. The director claimed that the producer's busy schedule was one of the reasons for the delayed release of the film.  Soundtrack  All the songs are composed by Ilaiyaraaja teaming up with the director yet again. A new audio company called Audio 9 was unveiled by politician Sahai Raj and the very first film to be produced under this label was Nannavanu. Actor Devaraj was the special invitee and he released the official soundtrack. The event was held in Bangalore on 8 May 2010.

Laws governing child labour in factories were first passed in 1874, but child labour on farms continued to be the norm up until the 20th century. History As everywhere, child labour in the Netherlands was driven by financial necessity. Children in rural areas have always been expected to help with chores around the home and farm, oftentimes (especially during harvests) foregoing schooling to work at home. This allowed poor rural families to extend their farming activities without having to hire on extra help. As the Industrial Revolution came, families moved to the cities for factory work, and lacking childcare, brought their children with them, who were then also put to work. Children provided cheap, agile and fast-learning labour, often able to accomplish manual tasks impossible to adults due to the size of their hands. Factory owners preferred children for their greater docility and willingness to work for lower wages than adults. Because of their greater agility, children were often used for the most dangerous machine maintenance tasks, leading to high death rates among labouring children. By 1860, more than 500,000 children (of a then population of three million people) between the ages of 6 and 11 were employed in Netherlands' factories. There appeared to be little opposition to this situation; the government actually encouraged the practice to keep the price of manufactured goods low. Children were employed in various industries, especially textiles, peat excavation, commercial bakeries, and tobacco products production. Typical wages in 1860 were 25 cents/day for girls and 35 cents/day for boys. The beginnings of change Beginning in the second half of the nineteenth century, sentiment began to rise against child labour. Realizing that child labour hampered children's education and was detrimental to their health, and that child labour was reducing the opportunities for adult labourers, the Dutch began to react. Newspaper articles and books were published speaking out against the practice, leading to the first child labour law in 1874. Samuel van Houten introduced the Kinderwetje -- van Houten (the Child Labour Act) that forbade children younger than 12 from working in factories. The law stipulated penalties for infractions, but did not authorize any agency to enforce the law. It also included many exceptions, such as farm work and home work. Because of its exceptions and lack of enforcement, the law had little effect on the overall child labour situation. It wasn't until 1882 that the government instituted as system of factory inspections to enforce the child labour laws. From 1882 until 1887, the penalties for illegal child labour were limited to fines levied against the factories, but in 1887, penalties became stricter, which led to an overall decline in child factory labour. In 1900, the Netherlands passed a law requiring all children to attend school until age 12. Truancy officers were empowered to verify school attendance, and recalcitrant parents were handled with increasingly severe consequences. After age 12, children were free to remain home or enter the work force. There was also at this time the advent of post-compulsory education, providing technical or professional training. Present day Currently, children in the Netherlands are required to attend school until the age of 18, or until they receive their secondary (high school) diploma.

Rocket mail Schmiedl was born in Schwertberg in Upper Austria, and from 1924 studied civil engineering at the Technische Hochschule in Graz.Schmiedel, Friedrich Austria-forum, accessed 24 May 2014.Schmiedl, Friedrich Encyclopedia Astronautica, accessed 23 May 2014. He began experiments with solid-fuel rockets in 1918. From 1924 the experiments took place at Schöckl, a mountain about 15 km north of Graz. Schöckl, where Schmiedl's rockets were launched On 2 February 1931 he launched a rocket from Schöckl, which contained 102 letters. It was operated by remote control and landed by parachute at St Radegund, a village about 3 km away. More successful launches were subsequently made, to St Radegund and to Kumberg, a village about 6 km away. Philatelists became interested in collecting letters which had been sent by rocket. Schmiedl envisaged that mail could be sent between towns by rocket; however the Austrian Post Office was not persuaded.Rocket Mail King George V Silver Jubilee stamps, accessed 23 May 2014.Schmiedl, Friedrich The Worlds of David Darling, accessed 23 May 2014. He also worked on rockets used to collect meteorological data, and rockets for aerial photography. The rocket mail launches eventually had to be discontinued: they were mostly financed by special postage stamps, and in 1934 the Austrian Post Office forbade this financing; in 1935 the Austrian government forbade the possession of explosives, so private rocket development could no longer be carried out. Second World War and after When the Second World War began, there was military interest in his work; however Schmiedl, not wishing his research to be used for military purposes, destroyed the research documents. After the war he declined an offer to work on rocket development in the USA. Staying in Austria, he worked on boat propulsion. Friedrich Schmiedl died in Graz in 1994. His bequest to the City of Graz was used to establish the Friedrich Schmiedl Foundation, to support new ideas to improve communications in the region of Graz.Ing.

C. as a type of Murus Gallicus but was pulled down again not long afterwards. The wooden elements of the wall have disappeared over the course of time by rotting away, but the stones have survived. The Heidenmauer is a cultural monument according to the protected monument act of Rhineland-Palatinate.  Geography  = Location = The site lies one kilometre northwest of Bad Durkheim, 170 metres above the town, and covers the 300-metre-high, domed summit of the hill and its southeastern hillside of the Kästenberg. The latter is a southern spur of the Teufelsstein, which is part of the Haardt, the eastern range of the Palatinate Forest facing the Upper Rhine Plain. South of the hillfort the little river of Isenach, a left tributary of the Rhine, breaks through the mountain barrier and enters the plain. = Surrounding area = To the left and below the former entrance of the Heidenmauer is the old Roman quarry of Kriemhildenstuhl. On the summit of the Teufelstein, a few hundred metres away, is the monolith of the same name, which may have been the location of religious rites in Celtic times. High above the southern bank of the Isenach lie the ruins of two medieval sites: the Hardenburg and, further downstream, the Benedictine abbey of Limburg.  History  The Heidenmauer and its associated settlement were established at the end of the Hallstatt period around 500 B. C. by a Celtic tribe that cannot be more specifically identified. Copious numbers of pottery finds have enabled a very precise dating. Almost all the containers are hand-made, only a few show traces of having been turned; this technology first appeared after c. 500 B. C. in the La Tène period. Other finds included iron, long knives (Hiebmesser) as well as querns (Napoleonshüte), pyramidal stones that were stuck point-down in the ground in order to provide the base for the milling of corn. In addition there is also evidence of milk production and iron smelting. Based on the finds, it appears that the settlers traded in pottery products from Upper Italy and especially from Ancient Greece. When, at the beginning of the La Tène period, the Greeks moved their trade routes to the Iberian Peninsula and the islands of the western Mediterranean, the settlers lost the source of their supply. Probably as a result of this, the settlement was only occupied by one generation, i.e. for 30 to 40 years. This is ascertainable from the under 20 cm thick settlement layer over the natural earth and from extremely rare improvements in the surviving base of the wall. There are no traces of fire nor conflict, so all sources indicate a peaceful settlement. The dismantling of the wall may have been to prevent a rival tribe from using the structure. In the 4th century A. D. a small part of the circular rampart as well as the Kriemhildenstuhl below was used by the Romans as a quarry.  Research history  After those parts of Electoral Palatinate that were west of the Rhine had been awarded to the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1815, Bavarian state surveyors became interested in the Heidenmauer. However, investigations were first undertaken in 1874/75 by student, Christian Mehlis, who later became a teacher of history and ancient languages in Neustadt an der Haardt. In 1937–39, Hans Schleif carried out the first excavations as part of the SS-associated project, Ahnenerbe, but these had to stop with the outbreak of the Second World War. Schleif thought he had uncovered a Germanic religious site, perhaps because he had mistaken a Roman marking in the Kriemhildenstuhl quarry below the Heidenmauer as a swastika. From 2004 to 2006, excavations were undertaken by the Speyer Archaeological Monument Conservation Authority (Archäologische Denkmalpflege Speyer) as part of the Early Celtic Princely Residence programme (Frühkeltische Fürstensitze) financed by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. The excavation leader was Thomas Kreckel. The project aims to validate the results, which are published inter alia in the daily paper, Die Rheinpfalz, of links to other Celtic relicts in the local area. These include Celtic remains on the terrain of Limburg Abbey two kilometres to the southwest, high above the southern, far side, of the Isenach river. If the excavations are validated, they should corroborate the view that the impulse for the settlement inside the Heidenmauer came from the Limburg Plateau, which had already been occupied by the Celts who remained there until the land was taken by the Romans (1st century B. C.).  Layout  Small reconstruction of the Heidenmauer The ringwork of the Heidenmauer consists of the rampart-like, apparently demolished stone wall. It surrounds the remains of a settlement, some of which lay open for centuries and some of which was not uncovered until it was excavated. The rampart is two and a half kilometres long in toto and encloses and area of 26 hectares. From its northernmost point to the southernmost corner is about 700 metres; from the westernmost to the easternmost corner is about 600 metres. The plan of the site is in the shape of a bow with its bowstring pulled back ready to fire. The bow extends from west through north to east, the bowstring forms and almost right-angled point facing south. Where the bow and bowstring meet in the east at the lowest point of the site (260 metres), there is a roughly seven metre wide gate with a roughly nine metre long entranceway with two lanes separated by a row of stones that are still visible today. The entrance was probably covered by a wooden gateway structure. The wall itself, a so-called Murus Gallicus, comprised a wooden frame constructed of vertical posts and horizontal crossbeams which was filled with dry rubble stone. The smooth sides of the stones formed the external facade. The spaces in between were largely filled with sand. Because the wooden elements have disappeared apart from a few remains (hence the reason it is sometimes called a Pfostenschlitzmauer or \\"post-slot wall\\"), the height of the original wall can only be indirectly estimated from current measurements. The profile of the present stone rampart tapers towards the top; at its base it is 15–20 metres thick; at the crest, three to four metres. Its height is between three and ten metres. Archaeologists suspect that, about 80 metres south of the gateway and above the Kriemhildenstuhl, was a bastion. There the rocks of the wall are facing inwards, which suggests that at this spot, which enables a wide view of the Rhine Plain and the entrance to the Isenach valley, a wooden tower was erected, overlooking the wall. In front of the arc of the northwestern wall, whose highest points run over the crest of the hill (at 285–300 metres above sea level), is a nearly 500-metre-long and up to 15-metre-wide ditch, which on the very flat summit was clearly intended to increase the height from the ground to the top of the wall. The ditch bends towards the northeast at the northernmost point of the wall, almost forming a right angle, and runs downhill before it ends after a distance of over 100 metres. In this way, during heavy rain, the water from the ditch was led away, preventing it from undermining the wall. In local folklore there is another legendary story of its origin: Hans von Trotha (around 1450–1503), a castellan regionally known as the robber baron, Hans Trapp, of the South Palatine castle of Bertwartstein (who almost certainly never visited the Heidenmauer site which had already fallen into ruins 2000 years ago), was supposed to have hidden a large supply of sausage in the ditch; this legend gave rise to its popular name, the Wurstgraben (\\"sausage ditch\\"). In the area enclosed by the wall are numerous small hillocks of different sizes. These are likely to be the remains of the domestic buildings that have yet to be explored; only a fragment of a floor of beaten clay has been exposed. For this reason, no conclusions can yet be drawn about the number of people who lived here. However, in view of the artefacts found, it was probably an extensive settlement. In the northern part of the site a spring reaches the surface, whose superfluous water may also have flowed to the northeastern ditch. During the time span of the settlement the site was largely treeless; in the 20th century it was deliberated reforested.

The mountain boasts impressive rock formations, sheer sandstone cliffs, patches of indigenous forest, mountain bamboo and rich stands of proteas, and is drained by numerous streams, waterfalls and rock pools, in which a new species of fairy shrimp was recently discovered. It is also the preserve of crowned and black eagles, lanner falcons, bearded vultures and the threatened Cape vulture. Dassies are common along rocky parts while various large mammals such as blesbuck, mountain reedbuck and Burchell’s zebra have been introduced to the area.

A Russian-built RPG-22 anti-tank rocket, fired 300 metres (330 yards) away from MI6 headquarters, struck the building on the south side of the eighth floor, causing superficial damage. No fatalities or injuries were recorded. Although London had been the targets of terrorist attacks before 2000, it had not been subjected to a rocket launcher attack; this was the first time a RPG-22 rocket launcher was seen and used in Great Britain. It was initially thought the Real IRA acquired the launchers from the Provisional IRA's arsenal, but later confirmed it was brought from the former Yugoslavia. The \\"audacious\\" attack caused minimal damage due to the building's bullet-proof and bomb-proof structure, failing to penetrate the inner cladding. At the time of the attack, the constituency of South Antrim was preparing for a by- election to be held the following day; it was won by Democratic Unionist William McCrea, who defeated Ulster Unionist David Burnside. Background The SIS building, headquarters of MI6 London had been the target of a similar attack in 1991 when an IRA mortar shell was fired at 10 Downing Street and exploded during a cabinet meeting held by then Prime Minister John Major. Before the Real IRA's MI6 attack, Hammersmith Bridge was damaged by a small bomb blast in June 2000, resulting in the bridge requiring renovation. A further planting of a bomb occurred near Ealing Broadway station in July 2000. A by-election in the constituency of South Antrim was scheduled to be held the day after the attack. Democratic Unionist William McCrea was elected with 37.95% of the votes, defeating fellow candidates Ulster Unionist David Burnside, Donovan McClelland of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, Martin Meehan of Sinn Féin, David Ford of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland and David Collins of the Natural Law Party. Details of the attack Three members of the RIRA went into an area of Spring Gardens and used a grassy knoll to fire their 2.8 kg RPG-22 missile about 300 metres away from the SIS Building. At 21:45 the grenade caused damage to a green plated glass window, metres below sensitive satellite equipment on the building's roof which was believed to be the main target. The force of the explosion was felt by people who were in underground stations and in nearby cars. Reaction The attack was condemned by the Deputy Assistant Commissioner and head of the Anti- Terrorist Branch of the Metropolitan Police Alan Fry as an \\"audacious attack in a busy part of London\\". Security procedures at the SIS Building were reviewed by the British Government in conjunction with the Metropolitan Police. Police sealed off an area between Vauxhall and Lambeth bridges to allow further investigations to occur. Services from Waterloo station were cancelled until the mid-afternoon on 21 September. Investigation A discarded launcher was discovered at a park in Spring Gardens, Vauxhall, along with remnants of the rocket. In an effort to trace the source of the RPG-22, security officers analysed the serial number located on the rocket launcher, which was identified to have originated from a cache of weapons in Croatia. A stockpile of RPG-22s were ordered by the Real IRA in July 2000 and were seized by Croatian police. Police in London conducted a fingertip search of nearby railway lines running into Waterloo station, which promoted speculation that the missile was fired from railway lines. There were extensive searches around the area of the SIS Building.

The company was started in 1910 when Otto Korhonen and three other carpenters bought Puuseppien Osuuskunta (\\"Carpenters' Co-operative\\") based in Turku, then Grand Duchy of Finland. The versatile portfolio comprised doors, windows and furniture which were produced in facilities located in Uudenmaankatu 7. The company was registered as Huonekalu- ja Rakennustyötehdas in 1912. At the end of the 1920s Otto Korhonen started co-operation with architect Alvar Aalto. Aalto had recently got two large projects: Southwestern Agricultural Cooperative Building in Turku and Paimio Sanatorium in Paimio. The sanatorium was the most significant collaborative project between Korhonen and Aalto; Huonekalu- ja Rakennustyötehdas produced its interior and furniture. Aalto and Korhonen planned together a number of armchairs and various tables for the personnel and patients. The Paimio Sanatorium was the inspiration for many of the Aalto's stackable designs, and this in turn influenced the American designers Charles and Ray Eames.Paimio chair in MOMA collection In the 1930s the company developed a wood bending method, which was largely applied on Aalto's furniture. Aalto's \\"Y-leg\\" introduced in 1947 and \\"X-leg\\" that followed in 1954 were based on method developed by Huonekalu- ja Rakennustyötehdas. The bent wooden parts became characteristic features in many Aalto's furniture models, such as \\"stacking chair\\" and \\"flexible wooden chair\\". The company is most notable for manufacturing the \\"stacking chair\\" designs of Alvar and Aino Aalto.Aalto's work there in Alvar Aalto: A Critical Study, by Malcolm Quantrill, 1983, Stackable three-legged chairs from this factory in MOMA collection In 1966 the company was renamed Huonekalutehdas Korhonen Oy.

Father Rale's War  In 1719–1720, the old trading post was remodeled into a stockaded fort protected by two blockhouses. But Abenaki Indian tribes protested the encroachment of an English fort on their territory. Instigated by the French, they attacked the garrison twice during Dummer's War in 1722, which was relieved by Col. Thomas Westbrook, then raided again in 1723 with a siege lasting 30 days. The Commanders were Thomas Smith, John Gyles (who also served at Fort George (Brunswick, Maine)) Jabez Bradbury (who also served at Fort Richmond (Maine) and Captain John North.

The following day, the two whale boats became separated and approximately 200–300 Abenaki descended on Harvey's boat, killing Harvey and all of his men except three native guides who escaped to the George's fort. Captain Winslow was then surrounded by 30 to 40 canoes, several with four or six men apiece aboard, which came off from both sides of the river and attacked him with great fury. With the Indians closing on him with their canoes, Winslow fired upon them when they were almost aboard him. After hours of fighting, Winslow and his men were killed, except for three friendly Indians who escaped back to the fort (one was named Wm. Jeffries of Harwich).
