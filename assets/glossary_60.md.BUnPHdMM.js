She is an Adjunct Associate Professor of Sociology with Swinburne University. She is also a member of The Australian Sociological Association and Sustainable Population Australia.  Education  Betts obtained an undergraduate degree with the University of Tasmania, majoring in English, History and Sociology. Her Honours degree was completed in Monash University. Her thesis explored the relationship between fertility patterns and shift in the accessibility of birth control methods. Betts published several academic articles drawing on this body of research. This includes a statistical exploration of the failure rate of the ovulation method of contraception and its persistence as a supported social policy avenue in the mid-1970s. Betts then completed a Diploma in Modern Greek at the University of Salonika. Betts obtained her PhD in Sociology from Monash University. Her thesis was titled Ideology and Immigration Australia 1976 to 1983. This thesis would go on to form the basis of her first authored book published in 1988, Ideology and Immigration: Australia 1976 to 1987.  Career  Betts worked as a Sociology lecturer at Monash University from 1981 to 1986, and then became Associate Professor of Sociology with Swinburne from 1987 to 2009, up until her retirement. Betts retains her status as an Adjunct Professor with Swinburne University in the present day. Along with Professor Bob Birrell, Betts was co-editor of the quarterly peer-reviewed journal People and Place (1993 to 2010), published by the Centre for Population and Urban Research.  Research  Betts has contributed to three broad areas of Australian sociology: demography and population; environmental sociology; and immigration and citizenship. = Demography and population = In her early career, in the mid-to-late 1970s, Betts analysed patterns of demography and population in connection to issues of fertility and contraception methods. This included a study of the decline of unwanted births in Victoria as a result of the new- found availability of birth control in 1971. Betts found that within the subsequent four-year period, demographic trends showed that unwanted births declined while the wanted births rate did not. In this period, the crude birth rate declined from 21.45 births per 1,000 to 16.65 births, and the number of total births had dropped by 13,601(from 75,498 births in 1971 to 61,897 in 1975). At the same time, Betts noted that despite this demographic shift, and in spite of the wider availability of birth control, disadvantaged groups continued to lack access to contraception due to lack of economic and social resources. This put poor people, youth, migrants and unmarried people at higher risk of unwanted births (measured through abortion rates and unwanted births carried to term). Some of the social issues that impacted on the use of new contraceptive methods included the lack of literacy and English-language skills amongst migrant women. Although some pamphlets were made available in a few minority languages, their dissemination was limited, meaning that migrant women were unlikely to understand their contraception options. Data showed that some migrant groups, such as Greek women, were still largely practising the withdrawal method. With respect to single women, a review of survey data on medical practitioners showed that physicians were reticent to prescribe the oral contraceptive pill to young unwed women. Few medical practitioners were willing to provide other methods of contraception other than sterilisation. This was due to their religious beliefs, especially amongst physicians of Catholic background. Betts argued that while fertility and birth control clinics filled in some gaps in the provision of birth control for disadvantaged groups, but they did not meet all their requirements. Betts' contribution to the early literature on contraception in Australia was to show that wider availability of contraception did not necessarily mean equal access. Vulnerable and disadvantaged groups were \\"ill equipped\\" to ask for and benefit from new contraceptive methods. In the late 1970s to mid-1980s, Betts examined the effectiveness of the Billings Ovulation Method of contraception, colloquially known as the ovulation or rhythm method. This technique was established in Australia and grew in popularity around the world. Betts notes that despite the introduction of more effective contraceptive methods in 1971, even in the late 1970s, Government funds and facilities were still promoting the ovulation method of contraception. This method requires that couples only practice safe sex during specific times of a woman's ovulation, and by monitoring a woman's vaginal mucus. Betts notes that this is an inaccurate method that does not adequately safeguard all women from conception, especially women with irregular menstrual cycles. Betts' research shows that Billings and his colleagues had close associations with the Catholic Church, which strongly advocated this method as the sole way to practice contraception. Betts also showed flaws in the original published research that Billings used to establish his methodology, such as with a limited sample of housewives (only 22 women were studied for one menstrual cycle in a follow up report by Billings). Betts also shows that several other studies excluded cases where pregnancy had occurred amongst women using the ovulation method, which significantly skewed the findings, and gave the impression that the Billings method was more successful in preventing unplanned births than was actually the case. Betts also reviews other data that shows that the ovulation method places the onus on women to regulate sexual activity, and therefore ignoring the social context in which sexual activity takes place. For example, studies showed that women were unable to negotiate abstinence from their husbands during specific times. Betts' research calls attention to the way in which the ovulation method became institutionalised in hospitals and birth clinics that received funding from Catholic-affiliated institutions. For example, in 1973-1974, Betts notes that the Family Planning Association received $200,000 of Government funding while Catholic family planning agencies received $100,000. In the late 1970s, Betts notes that half of pregnancies were still unplanned. Under these circumstances, Betts argued that Governments should promote methods of contraception that were more reliable. Betts returned to this subject in the mid-1980s. She notes that the Billings Method had come under significant criticism, including being the subject of an inquiry by the Royal Commission on Human Relationships. Betts' research reviews evidence from comprehensive studies on the biological basis of the Billings Method. The evidence shows that even amongst women who monitored both their body temperature and vaginal mucus levels, mucus symptoms were \\"erratic.\\" In one study of 166 women who recorded 1,600 menstrual cycles, 75% of participants could observe mucus in every cycle, while 21% could only notice this sometimes, and the rest couldn't measure mucus at all. Other studies showed that women were more likely to get pregnant using the Billings method than women using other methods, such as the oral contraceptive pill, IUDs, condoms and diaphragms. Most of these women said they either abandoned the Billings method or miscalculated because the method was either \\"too complicated,\\" or there were \\"too many rules to follow\\" or there were \\"too many qualifications\\" to observe. Betts argues that while all methods of contraception require that individuals adhere to proper use, the Billings method was still less effective than other methods and she questioned the Government's continued support of this as a primary family planning strategy. While Betts continued to research population issues over the next two decades, she returned to specific topic of women's fertility issues and population in the mid-to-late 2000s. During the October 2004 Federal election, Christian lobby groups and Coalition candidates ran a campaign advocating that the Australian population was largely against abortion. Betts drew on empirical data from population surveys which showed that 81% of the Australian population was resolutely pro-choice, while only 9% were firmly against abortion.

Wilno is an unincorporated community located in Royal Township, Lincoln County, Minnesota, United States. History Wilno was laid out in 1883 on land provided by the Chicago and Northwestern railroad to create a Polish settlement. The community was formed as part of a planned effort between the railroad and leaders of Polish National Alliance (PNA) with the cooperation of the Catholic Church. The organizers named the town after Vilnius by taking its Polish name Wilno. St. John Cantius Church was established in the town in the same year.John Radzilowski, \\"Hidden Cosmos: The Life Worlds of Polish Immigrants in Two Minnesota Communities, 1875-1925,\\" Ph.D. diss., Arizona State University, 1999. Rev. R. Byzewski of Winona born in Kashubia and Bishop John Ireland of St. Paul also worked to establish the church. By 1891, the town was centered on the Polish Catholic parish and school. It also had a post office, carpenter, blacksmithy, general store, saloon, and wagonmaker. The town postmaster also operated a small reading room.Radzilowski, \\"Hidden Cosmos.\\" A common myth is that when the railroad attempted to buy land for right-of-way, two Wilno farmers refused the amount offered. So the railroad was built through what became the town of Ivanhoe instead. In fact the railroads frequently bypassed small \\"inland\\" towns like Wilno.Radzilowski, Out On the Wind: Poles and Danes in Lincoln County, Minnesota, 1880-1905 (Marshall, MN: Crossings Press, 1992), 56-61. The town remained a tiny Catholic settlement. The centennial for the church was celebrated in 1983. At that time Wilno consisted of the church, two stores, and 10 households.

Among the books are A Dab of Dickens & A Touch of Twain (Simon & Schuster) - an edited collection of several of his well-known lectures, and Pickwick Papers: An Annotated Bibliography. Engel's mini-lecture series on Charles Dickens ran on PBS television stations around the country. Four plays which Engel has written have been produced during the last ten years. Engel's play, The Night Before Christmas Carol, has enjoyed success as an annual national public television broadcast in both the United States and Canada, an EbzB Productions' performance with actor David zum Brunnen, as well as having enjoyed multi-year touring success nationally with the same actor. The premiere collaboration of The Night Before Christmas Carol featured actor Jeffrey West, who originated the role on stages in North Carolina. Engel's articles have appeared in numerous newspapers and national magazines including Newsweek. He has lectured throughout the United States and on all seven continents (although his Antarctica lecture was delivered on a cruise ship). He continues his teaching and lectures at present. Widely recognized for his concentration in Dickensian Scholarship, Engel received North Carolina‚Äôs Adult Education Award, North Carolina State‚Äôs Alumni Professorship, and the Victorian Society‚Äôs Award of Merit. In 2009, he was inducted into the Royal Society of Arts in England for his academic work and service in promoting Charles Dickens. Most recently in 2014, Engel was named Tar Heel of the Week by the Raleigh News and Observer for his thirty years of delivering public programs in the humanities and sponsoring state and national literary contests for high school students. Since 1980, Dr. Engel has been President of the Dickens Fellowship of North Carolina, the largest branch of this worldwide network of clubs.

Lee originated from an area of thunderstorm activity near the Truk Atoll towards the end of December. Following an increase in organization, the system was classified as a tropical cyclone on December 22\\\\. After becoming a tropical storm, Lee began to slowly strengthen, and attained typhoon status on December 24\\\\. While turning west towards the Philippines, Lee began to intensify more rapidly. It is estimated to have reached peak intensity the next day, with winds of . At peak intensity, the storm moved ashore the central Philippines later on December 25\\\\. Lee emerged into the South China Sea the following day as a tropical storm. Initially, the storm maintained its intensity, but soon began to weaken due to increased wind shear. By December 28, all of the thunderstorm activity was removed from the center, and on December 29, Lee dissipated. However, the remnants of the cyclone was last noted a few hundred kilometers south of Hong Kong. Across the Philippines, Typhoon Lee killed 188 people. In addition, 674,619 people were directly affected by the typhoon. Furthermore, 76,169 dwellings were demolished while 39,586 families, or 208,336 people, were rendered as homeless. A total of 53,314 houses were partially damaged. Also, 548,525 people sought refuge in shelters. Additionally, 1,586 individuals were injured due to Lee. Overall, damage totaled to $74.1 million (1981 USD), $46.4 million of which was from infrastructure and an additional $2.2 million came from agriculture. The island of Samar sustained the worst damage caused by the storm. There, 82 fatalities were reported and 56 were injured. A total of 19,390 people were displaced; roughly 8,000 families or 48,000 people was forced to move to evacuation centers. Elsewhere, in the coastal town of Calapan, 5,600 dwellings received damage, and 85% of the coastal town's residents were displaced from their homes. Meteorological history On December 21, 1981, an area of convection began to organize west of the Truk Atoll. Despite strong wind shear, Hurricane Hunter aircraft data yielded winds of near-gale force and a barometric pressure of the next day. Initially, the aircraft did not find any evidence of a closed low-level circulation. At 1000 UTC on December 22, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the system. Two hours later, the JTWC upgraded the disturbance into Tropical Depression 29 following the discovery of a closed surface circulation by Hurricane Hunters. By that evening, thunderstorm activity had become more concentrated towards the center; as such, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) first classified the system as a tropical cyclone. Following a further increase in organization, both the JMA and JTWC upgraded the cyclone into Tropical Storm Lee early on December 23. Meanwhile, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Dinang. Initially, Lee veered west-northwest due to a mid-latitude trough exiting off the Asia mainland. At 0600 UTC on December 23, the JTWC classified Lee as a typhoon. At 0000 UTC on December 24, the JMA upgraded Lee into a severe tropical storm. Six hours later, the agency classified Lee as a typhoon. Around this time, the JTWC predicted that Lee would turn north after entering the South China Sea due to the influence of an extratropical cyclone. However, as the storm turned west because the trough had moved away, the JTWC kept prolonging the northward turn. Moving in the general direction of the Philippines, Lee began to rapidly intensify. At 0600 UTC on December 25, the JTWC reported winds of , equivalent to a high-end Category 2 hurricane on the United States-based Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. According to the JTWC, this would be the storm's peak intensity. Meanwhile, the JMA estimated peak intensity of and a minimum pressure of . That afternoon, the typhoon made landfall along the central portion of the Philippines. After landfall, rapid weakening occurred, and when the storm entered the South China Sea on December 26, the JTWC reduced the winds of Lee to . Despite this, data from the JMA suggests that system was stronger, with winds of . Based on additional reports from Hurricane Hunters, the JTWC revised its forecast and now anticipated the tropical cyclone to move on a westerly course and strike central Vietnam. Moving into an area of decreased monsoonal flow, Lee maintained its intensity for 18 hours. Satellite imagery showed a banding-type eye. However, by December 27, Lee began to feel the effects of an extratropical cyclone located to the north of the storm; consequently, Lee began to make a gradual turn towards the northwest. Lee began to encounter increased vertical wind shear, and early on December 27, the JMA lowered the intensity of Lee to . Later that day, a Hurricane Hunter investigation recorded a pressure of as the storm began to turn towards the north, exiting PAGASA's warning zone. By 0000 UTC on December 28, all of the deep convection was displaced from the center. Six hours later, the JMA estimated that Lee weakened to winds below tropical storm force. By midday, satellite imagery suggested that Lee was no longer a tropical cyclone; however, the JTWC continued to issue warnings on the system until 0000 UTC on December 29. At 1800 UTC, the JMA stopped watching the system. The remnants of Lee were last noted by the JTWC roughly south of Hong Kong. Preparations and impact Prior to landfall, twelve provinces, including some in Luzon, were placed on typhoon alert. Upon moving through the central Philippines, Typhoon Lee affected some of the same areas devastated by Typhoon Irma earlier that month, which was considered the strongest storm to affect the island since 1970. Lee knocked out communications and left many coconut-producing areas isolated. Railway services to and from Manila was suspended. Even though nine domestic flights were canceled, the Manila International Airport remained open throughout the passage of the typhoon. Across Manila, some flooding was reported and high winds tore off some Christmas decorations in hotels along the bay. The Sorsogon Province was one of the hardest hit areas by the typhoon; 20 casualties happened there because of flooding. In the coastal region of Legaspi, home to a large volcano, 150 houses were demolished due to storm surge, 25 of which were swept out at sea. Telephone lines were also cut off for four days in the city. Storm surge was also noted in coastal towns in the Sorsogon, Masbate, and Albay provinces. In the latter, three villages were damaged. Just south of the capital city of Manila, in the coastal town of Calapan on Mindoro Island, 5,600 houses were damaged, and 20,000 persons or 85% of the town's residents were left without a home. Two fatalities were reported in the city. In the fishing village of San Fernando on Masbate Island, 50 thatched huts were flattened. Elsewhere, four people were killed and three others injured in Naujan, where 86 homes were either damaged or destroyed. According to officials, 82 people were killed on the island of Samar. Throughout the island, the system destroyed schools, residences, an airport terminal, the government house in Catarman, and a jail, enabling 11 prisoners to escape. Most of damage to Samar was caused by collapsing houses and uprooted coconut trees hurled by the gusty winds. A total of 19,390 people were displaced; roughly 8,000 families or 48,000 people of which were forced to move to evacuation centers. An additional 56 people were hurt province-wide. Ten homes were washed away along a coastal village in the Marinduque Province. One person also perished due to electrocution outside of Naga City. One hundred eighty-eight people were killed, primarily due to drownings. Another 674,619 people were directly affected by the typhoon. A total of 76,169 dwellings were demolished, and 39,586 families, or 208,336 people, were displaced. This total included approximately 6,000 people in the provinces of Romblon, Quezon, and Albay. Overall, a total of 53,314 homes were partially damaged. Moreover, 548,525 people sought refuge in shelters. Additionally, 1,586 persons were injured due to Lee. Overall, damage totaled to $74.1 million, including $46.4 million from infrastructure and $2.2 million from agriculture. Damage was estimated at $44 million in Samar. Aftermath Within a few days after the passage of Typhoon Lee, relief agencies were deployed to distribute food and medicines to families temporarily housed in schools, town halls and churches. Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos declared an emergency and a \\"state of calamity\\" in the provinces of Northern Samar, Masbate, Mindoro Oriental, and Romblon. He subsequently released $1.8 million in order to repair roads, bridges and schools. Several evacuation centers were opened up in schools and town halls.

The episode was written by Daniel Cerone and was directed by Jeremy Podeswa. Title The episode's title is a quote from the children's book, Where the Wild Things Are. Plot A written manifesto sent by the Bay Harbor Butcher to a local newspaper sends Lundy's special task force scrambling to find clues in it. Doakes almost discovers the truth about Dexter's past, which forces Dexter to devise a plan to get him suspended from the police force.

IGN's Eric Goldman gave the episode a rating of 9.3 out of 10, and commented that \\"[a]ll these elements are combining to make Dexter a sort of intensely horrific version of a soap opera. And with a show about a serial killer, that's not a bad thing at all. This was a very strong episode, deftly weaving together several plotlines and upping the tension in several ways.\\" The A.V.

Tonight, I was a little worried over a concern that Alan Sepinwall has voiced in his weekly write-ups this season: Basically, the possibility of Dexter turning into Vic Mackey on The Shield, stretching credibility as he miraculously slips the knot, season after season. Ironically, I'm rarely bothered by that element of The Shield, but it can be a bit of a distraction on Dexter, because Dex's ability to elude justice isn't as interesting as his compulsion to break the law. It's not that his attempts to sabotage the investigation aren't entertaining; they just don't fit with the overall intent of the show.

It stars Ramsey Nouah, Chidi Mokeme, Rita Dominic, and Ibinabo Fiberesima. Set six years after the civil war, a young officer from the Middle Belt gets into a romantic relationship with an O-level student from the South-eastern region. However, their relationship is strained by constant military postings. The soldier gets accused of being involved in the unsuccessful 1976 military coup and assassination of General Murtala Mohammed, and the heavily pregnant wife gets entangled in an emotional dilemma. The historical account in ‚Äô76 went through a seven-month approval period at the Nigerian Military before filming started. The film, which is set in the 1970s, was shot in Ibadan, Oyo. The film, which was shot on 16-millimeter film with an Arriflex 416 camera, was in production for about five years. Note: The interview was conducted in 2012. Plot summary Set six years after the civil war, a young officer from the Middle Belt, Joseph Dewa, gets into a romantic relationship with an O-level student, Suzanne, from the South-eastern region. However, their relationship is strained by constant military postings and Suzanne's family who constantly complained of not wanting to have anything to do with Joseph's people. In a series of event that followed and betrayal of trust from Joseph's friend, Gomos, Joseph gets accused of being involved in the unsuccessful 1976 military coup and assassination of General Murtala Mohammed. His release will be based on his innocence by producing his Identity Card, of which he couldn't. Suzanne went through a lot of emotional pains, coupled with the delivery of a baby girl. She eventually did everything she could to prove his husband's innocence. Joseph wasn't executed, but was dismissed from the army. Cast *Ramsey Nouah as Captain Joseph Dewa *Chidi Mokeme as Major Gomos *Rita Dominic as Suzie *Ibinabo Fiberesima as Angela *Daniel K.

Jaiye *Pat Nebo as Colonel Aliu *Nelly Ekwereogu as Ikenna *Shuaibu Ebenesi Adams as Lieutenant Jubril *Debo Oguns as Noel Production Ojukwu always had fantasies about making military movies, so much that he followed many coup stories. When the ‚Äô76 project came along, he had to do a lot more readings and research, and also consult scholars on the crucial aspects of the story, to ensure historical accuracy; over a year was spent on the pre-production stage of the film. The historical account of ‚Äô76 had the support of the Nigerian Military, as the script went through a seven-month investigation and approval period before filming started. The military also assigned personnel to train the actors and guide the military aspect of the film. During the film's development, the director tried to minimize violence as he wanted people to focus on the story and not get distracted or pissed off by gory images. Eight period cars of the 1970s were refurbished to be used in the film. Filming took place mainly at Mokola Barracks, Ibadan, Oyo. The film was shot using Arriflex 416 Super 16 cameras; It was initially meant to be shot on 35mm film, but the ground glass of one of the cameras to be used got damaged. As a result, the director opted to shoot on 16mm film instead. The film stock used for filming, along with other equipment used for production, were subsidized by the Nigerian Film Corporation. After over four months on set, Principal photography was concluded during July 2012. Release A teaser trailer was released to the public on 20 November 2012 The release was initially slated for 4 October 2013, but it was pushed back indefinitely due to delayed post production. A first official trailer for the film was released on 14 November 2014. The film was selected to premiere at the Toronto International film Festival during September 2016, and at the BFI London Film Festival. The film was released on 25 November 2016. Themes Izu Ojukwu stated that \\"it‚Äôs a story told from a dual point of view‚Äîfrom the soldier‚Äôs patriotic perspective and from that of the officer‚Äôs wives.\\" Ojukwu also made it clear that the film paid homage to the strength of soldiers' wives: \\"As far as I‚Äôm concerned, the wives are the real soldiers.... They are the ones who suffer from whatever decisions their husbands make‚Äîwhether on the battlefield or within their office complexes.\\" Issues reflected in the film include the rumours of foreign involvement in Murtala Muhammed's coup. Ojukwu stated: \\"You cannot run away from them‚Ä¶. You must deal with all the rumours‚Äîalthough we cannot say, factually, what happened‚Ä¶.\\" The film also strongly portrayed intertribal marriages; ‚Äô76 is set six years after the Nigerian Civil War, and, according to the director, this was an era when the Nigerian people started playing down on all forms of discrimination and saw themselves more as brothers and sisters.

The Admiralty converted her to a storeship shortly after her capture and fitting. She participated at the siege of Acre in 1799 with the result that her crew qualified for the Naval General Service Medal issued in 1847. She was sold in 1802.  Dutch service  In 1795, French cavalry captured Alliantie during the French capture of the Dutch fleet at Den Helder. In February 1795, she received a French crew, but probably remained too undermanned to be serviceable. In May, the Batavian Republic signed a peace and alliance treaty with France, and the French returned Alliantie against payment. Capture On 22 August 1795 a squadron of four British Royal Navy frigates consisting of , , , and , encountered two frigates and a cutter from the Navy of the Batavian Republic. The engagement was fought off the Norwegian coastal island of Eiger√∏ya, then in Danish Norway. At 16:15 the leading British ship, Stag, under Captain Joseph Sydney Yorke, caught and engaged the rearmost Batavian ship, Alliante; the remainder of the British squadron continued in pursuit of the Batavian squadron. For an hour Alliante held out against the more powerful Stag but eventually struck. The remainder of the Batavian squadron escaped due to a fierce rearguard action by the frigate , safely reaching Eiger√∏ya. Casualties on Stag numbered four men killed and 13 wounded; Dutch casualties on Alliantie are unknown. Alliante sailed to Britain under the command of Lieutenant Patrick Tonyn of Stag. Alliante was subsequently taken to Spithead where the Admiralty purchased her for the Royal Navy as the frigate HMS Alliance. British service The British fitted Alliance at Sheerness and Deptford. She had arrived at Sheerness Dockyard to be fitted on 24 September 1795, was launched on 15 October and sailed on 7 December 1795. The Admiralty registered her on 25 November 1795. She was commissioned as a storeship of 22 guns in December under Commander William Cuming (or Cumming). Cumming received promotion to post captain on 13 October 1797. His replacement on Alliance was Commander Henry Heathcote, who was appointed in August. He received promotion to post captain on 5 February 1798.Marshall (1824), Vol. 2, Part 1, p.123. Alliance underwent fitting at Blackwall in February and March, with Commander John Baker Hay assuming command of her in March. He sailed her to the Mediterranean Sea in June. On 2 February 1799 she was with Captain Sir Thomas Troubridge's squadron as they arrived at Alexandria. Troubridge and his squadron left Acre for Alexandria, with Sir Sidney Smith in replacing them. In March Commander David Wilmot replaced Hay. On 24 March, Alliance arrived at Acre with orders from Troubridge to discharge her cargo and return immediately. When Wilmot arrived at Acre, Smith quoted the Articles of War to the effect that His Majesty's ships were required to assist a known friend in need; he commandeered Alliance while Wilmot agreed with enthusiasm. In the first week of April a gale forced Tigre to stand off, but Smith reported Alliance and the gun-vessels he had captured, all except one, rode out the gale. Smith anchored Tigre and , one on each side of the town, so their broadsides could assist the defence. Alliance and the gun-vessels were of shallower draft and so could come in closer. Together, they helped repel repeated French assaults. However, Wilmot received a fatal shot through the neck from a rifleman on 8 April as Wilmot mounted a howitzer on the breach in the wall at Acre. Additionally, the day before Alliance had three men wounded. The French attacked multiple times between 19 March and 10 May before Napoleon finally gave up. On 21 May he destroyed his siege train and retreated back to Egypt, having lost 2,200 men dead, 1,000 of them to the plague. Smith sailed with his squadron on 12 June. He proceeded first to Beruta road, and then to Larnica road, Cyprus, in order to refit his little squadron. He and Tigre then departed for Constantinople, Alliance and the gun-vessels remaining in the theatre. By 11 September 1800, Alliance was at Portsmouth, because on that day Lieutenant E. H. Clark of Alliance underwent a court martial on board Gladiator for being absent without leave. Clark was found guilty; he was dismissed from service, and from serving in any capacity whatever in the Royal Navy. Commander John Melhuish assumed command in December.

The church is listed on the NSW State Heritage Register and on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate.The Heritage of Australia (Macmillan Company) 1981, p. 2/44 The Cooks River, named by James Cook in 1770 when he sailed into Botany Bay, is crossed by the Princes Highway, about to the south of the church. The suburb of St Peters, in which the church is located, was named as a result of the area's proximity to the church. History St Peters Church photographed by John Henry Harvey sometime before 1938 =Aboriginal occupation= The church site forms part of the core of the territory of the Darug Coastal Nation. The geological formation of the study area is described as part of the Wianamatta Group and chiefly Ashfield Shale resulting in clay soils supporting an indigenous forest vegetation structure dominated by Turpentine and Ironbark tree association. =Early colonial land grants and settlement (1799 - 1826)= The church site forms part of the land granted to Thomas Smyth in 1799 following the colonial invasion of the east coast of New South Wales. Lands including the study area were acquired by Robert Campbell and the original grant was referred to as Bulanaming was subdivided and 6 acres 14 perch, on the higher ground on the low ridge between Gumbramorra Creek to the north west and Shea's Creek to the south east, were reserved for the erection of a church. Much of the indigenous forest was cleared to obtain timber and get access to the relatively fertile soils for agricultural pursuits. This resulted in an open landscape character with scattered remnant trees. =Alexander Brodie Spark (1826 - 1838)= Thirteen of the forty two allotments of Campbell's subdivision were purchased by Alexander Brodie Spark along with three smaller grants on the southern side of the Cooks River in 1826. Spark was an established Sydney merchant, a leading member of the community and a considerable land speculator holding land at the Glebe, Potts Point and the Hunter Valley besides his Cooks River land. Spark was a classically educated man and this possibly influenced his decision to name his major Cooks River property \\"Tempe\\" after the Vale of Tempe, a beautiful valley in ancient Greek legend which lay at the foot of Mount Olympus. Spark employed architect John Verge to design his Tempe house. He had previously (1831) employed Verge to design \\"Tusculum\\" on Woolloomooloo Hill (Potts Point) but apparently preferred the Cooks River property by moving to the Tempe estate in 1833 to oversee the implementation of the new residence and its picturesque garden setting. Spark and his estate played a key role in the establishment of a community at St Peters and in the building of the St Peter's Anglican Church. Spark was one of the original trustees of St. Peter's Anglican Church, St Peters. When Spark died he was buried in St. Peter's graveyard. The location of the grave is uncertain. =Construction and early years (1838 - 1864)= The Cooks River area was popular as a location for well-to-do estates from the mid 1800s onwards. It was not until the 1880s that the Cooks River area was closely settled. The church site comprising 6 acres 14 perches was transferred by Campbell, in December 1837, to the \\"Bishop of Australia\\" for the erection of the church. A. B. Spark, as the largest landowner in Campbell's subdivision, was highly active in the local community and was involved in business dealings with many of his neighbours including John Lord who was his co-director of the Bank of Australia. Bishop Broughton proceeded to establish the church and tenders were called for the erection of the church appearing on 16 March 1838 to the designs of the architect Thomas Bird. Spark may have been influential in the selection of the architect who had worked with him on another project (the Sydney Exchange Building) and had engaged Bird to work on improvements to his residence \\"Tempe\\" in April 1839. Spark was elected as one of the five trustees as elected on 16 April 1838. The other trustees were; The Lord Bishop of Australia, Robert Campbell, John Lord and David Chambers. A temporary church was constructed of ironbark slabs on a stone foundation on the land dedicated by Campbell, and intended, as a permanent church site, to the north of the site of the intended permanent structure. This was opened 13 May 1838. A foundation stone was laid on 13 July 1838 and the church licensed on 20 November 1839. Spark hosted the celebrations for the licensing and afterwards at his residence Tempe House. The church was described at the time of the licensing that ; \\"it was a handsome building in the Gothic style\\" and \\"the church is surrounded by a handsome railing, has a steeple, spire etc.\\"P+D 1994 p.3 The contractor was Henry Knight of Macdonaldtown. Spark appeared the major agitator for the church as he had approached the Governor to gain additional funds for the church and a parsonage. In his diary Spark records the acquisition of a Seraphin (organ), font and Communion Service. The building was constructed of sun dried bricks, ironbark internal columns ( from nearby Gannon's Forest), plaster vaulted ceiling and imported stain glass windows from England. The church footprint measured 90 feet by 35 feet and fronted the main road, Cook's River Road (now Princes Highway). The bricks were made by Henry Knight, who ran a steam brick-making machine in the 1840s. He was responsible for the first practical experiment in the field of individual home ownership for the working population. He subdivided his land at Macdonaldtown and sold it for 1 pound per foot on long terms, free of interest. In 1872 he was elected to the first Council of the borough of Macdonaldtown (later Erskineville) and became. The parsonage was a single storey verandahed structure located behind the church and towards the south west and apparently had a timber shingled roof (probably local Casuarina glauca shingles). The graveyard was enclosed by a curving picket fence in between the church and the main road to the south east corner. It was consecrated on 26 December 1840 with the first burial taking place in 1839. Gates to the burial ground were repaired in 1841 and the painted fencing completed in 1845. Further repairs to the fencing were carried out in 1848 and 1852. All of these built facilities underwent change in this period with the parsonage undergoing works in the form of a new well and an extension of the chimney in 1841 and a building survey was conducted in 1843. Repairs were carried out in 1847 and 1849. Additions were made to the parsonage in the 1860s when Reverend King was in occupation and these appear to have been prepared by the architect John Bibb in 1855. Bibb was requested to prepare an estimate for repairs to the parsonage and a plan for a Schoolmaster's residence which was completed in 1856. The extent of the works is unclear; however the Vestry Minutes give some explanation with the addition of outbuildings (stables) in 1862 and two wooden rooms added to the parsonage together with painting and plumbing works in 1865. The western wall of the Church now has stone buttresses on either side of the main entrance and these may date from this period involving the advice of the Sydney architects, Edmund Blacket, James Hume and Henry Robertson. The architectural details of these buttresses are different from the others dating to the original construction of the church. The work appears to be that of Edmund Blacket as the appointment of Hume or Robertson was ruled out due to their negative assessment of the condition of the Church. The main church building fabric was impacted by white ants (termites), a lack of sub-floor ventilation and poor drainage and was described as dilapidated. James Hume recommended the demolition of the building and another built alongside the existing building. This was not an option so Edmund Blacket was appointed to carry out repairs, and according to the Vestry Minutes, he prepared specifications for stone and brickwork with the repairs completed in 1847. Within the church, internal columns were replaced, due to damage by white ant activity, and the western wall propped up due to its detachment from the body of the building in 1846. By 1851 further repair work was carried out to infill openings in the walls of the church and by 1863 a suggestion made for the inclusion of a Ggallery in the church. A day school was established in 1848 following the acquisition of a school allotment in 1847, its fencing and building a schoolhouse in 1855, and a schoolmaster's residence in 1856. The school continued to hold the denominational school of St Peter's Church until 1880 - 1881 when it merged with the present public school. =1865 - 1906= In this period the graveyard was extended by 1868 with a further extension in 1874 and ultimately the last burial took place in 1896. Also by 1868 the Cooks River Road frontage was defined by a dwarf stone wall, timber paling and rail fence with centrally located gates together with a northern gate (built 1865). In 1864 a new gallery was completed for the west end of the church building to accommodate the growing needs of the congregation, and in 1865 an addition to the parsonage saw symmetrical gabled wing buildings attached to the earlier structure. In 1866 (29 May) and in 1867 (5 July) plants were sent from the Sydney Botanic Gardens for the then rector the Reverend George King for use within the grounds and to improve the landscape setting of both the church and the adapted parsonage complex. In 1869 the architect George Allen Mansfield was employed to prepare a report on the repairs needed to the church roof. Mansfield also recommended the replacement of the existing render to the walls with cement. In 1870 Mansfield was advised to call for tenders for the following works: removal of plaster and walls to be cemented, pillars marbled, ceiling whitewashed, door painted inside and out and the exterior of the building to be coloured. Due to a response to the poor condition of the church the architect Edmund Blacket was employed again during the mid 1870s and 1880s. This resulted in extensive alterations including; provision of a chancel at the eastern end of the church, replacement of pews, new communion rails, new font and replacement of stained glass windows. In 1880 a pipe organ made by Brindley & Foster of Sheffield, England, was installed in the gallery of the church. Further works were carried out under the instruction of Blacket. Edmund Blacket died in February 1883 and his son, Cyril, continued the architectural practice. Blacket Brothers Architects were employed as early as 1870 to carry out repairs to the tower of the church. William Francis Boulton Uzzell was incumbent of St. Peter's Church. Uzzell was ordained by Bishop Barker in 1864. In 1879 he became the first Moore College graduate to become rector of St. Peter's Church, Cooks River. Born in Devon in 1834 he was son of William Uzzell, toll keeper and Cecilia Boulton. In 1867 he married Frances Langley, sister of the Revds. John Douse and Henry Archdell Langley. During Uzzell's six year ministry at St. Peter's, major work was done on the building, including the pipe organ and Blacket works =1906 - 1928= The 1906-1913 period is characterised by the demolition of the original parsonage (with the possible exception of some of the outbuildings, including former stables) and the erection of a new building adjacent to the earlier one and to the south. The architectural style of the new building is consistent with the fashions of the Federation Period. In 1913 the church land was subdivided due to the resumption of three acres and one rood to the north west for the purposes of creating land for the St Peters Primary School. In 1916 the iron roof of the church was replaced with slate, repairs carried out to windows and ceiling and electric lights installed. Repairs were also made to the graveyard. A portion of land fronting the Princes Highway was lost due to road widening in 1927 which resulted in the relocation of graves and the construction of a recycled sandstone retaining wall and bull nosed brick dwarf wall. The Vestry minutes indicate that was taken off the property. =1928 - 1932= A tennis court was constructed on the south side of the church and in front of the Parsonage. In 1928 a kindergarten hall was commenced directly behind the church. It appears that excavations were commenced in an area adjacent to the tennis court but eventually the hall was located to the rear of the church and to the design of architect Leslie Wilkinson. The 1930 aerial photographNSW Dept. of Lands, 20 February 1930 indicates a central square hall structure located symmetrically to the western entrance of the church. This may have been a temporary structure until the implementation of the final hall complex in brickwork during1932 - 1934. Further contemporary photographic evidence, thought to be of the laying of the foundation stone for the new hall, indicates the temporary hall as a pyramidal formed building clad in corrugated iron being encased by the present brick structure. This structure was known as the Kindergarten Hut. It was designed and drawn up by Mr Cullingham who was also the working director for its implementation. Assistance was given by Messrs Stanley, Bland, Smith, Robins and Dick.Parish Notes, May 1928. =1932 - 1963= Wilkinson's hall was completed during 1932 which had a great physical and visual impact on the composition of the original church building. The other major impact to the original design composition was the removal of the spire of the church and bell chamber in 1963. Alternative methods for the reconstruction of the steeple were suggested by the architect Morton Herman but these were found to be structurally unsound in principle. Wilkinson's new hall was built by G. Billworth for A¬£1,030 and was implemented when Wilkinson had become a lay canon to St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney as well as the President of the Institute of Architects of NSW. He was also of note due to his academic position of professor of architecture and the first chair of architecture at the University of Sydney. An advocate of formal simplicity his buildings were often signified by a decorative fleche. In the case of St Peters Hall the fleche acted as a vent as well as a lantern at the apex of the central roof form. This element has since been removed. In 1934, as part of the celebrations of the 95th anniversary of the laying of the foundation stone a brick walled element was constructed in front of the east end of the church and below a lancet window. It supported a tablet which commemorated Captain James Cook's association with the naming of the river and subsequently the Parish of Cook's River. This was unveiled by Captain C. J. Pope on 7 July 1934. On the same day was the dedication of a flag-mast and the planting of trees within the church grounds by at least thirteen visitors. The wall and tablet are not extant. Also added to the site at this time was a garage, and a man's room. =1963 - 1996= In 1965 a wayside chapel was established in the eastern end of the church under the tower. In 1976 considerations were made to adapt the graveyard as a park and a Cooks River Cemetery Act was passed to remove the graveyard. This reflected the fashion of the time when other graveyards were turned into recreational park spaces, however the NSW National Trust intervened by classifying the church and grounds to ensure the conservation of the graveyard. In 1978 conservation works were proposed by architects Woodhouse and Danks. Works included the removal of external render to repair water damage, carpeting and removal of the pews. Prior to the carpeting the floor finishes comprised a central carpet runner and the margins painted in Japan Black. Also in 1980 damp proof courses were added and the walls rendered. =1996 - present= In 1996 a new parsonage was built in the southern corner of the grounds partly on the site of the former tennis court and both parsonage buildings fenced with secure metal fencing. In February 2005 site works were carried out to the ground adjacent to the northern wall of the church in an attempt to gain footing stabilisation through control of the moisture levels in the soil. A concrete apron was laid against the junction of the northern wall and the ground with a layer of plastic membrane under the concrete and extending northwards for two metres with soil and grass replaced over the membrane and two parallel drainage lines to feed a gatic pit to the east.CAB Consulting 2009 In 1999 the roof of the church was replaced and other repairs made such as ceilings and windows following storm damage, particularly from hail impact. A metal shed acting as a garage and storage space was located to the southern side of the 1906 parsonage.  Church complex  The site contains three main buildings, a remnant graveyard, fencing, concrete, brick and bitumen paving, retaining walls, entry gate piers and road, grassing, small garden areas and tree planting. The three main buildings are; St Peter's Church and hall, the former 1906 Rectory and the 1996 Rectory. Some archaeological potential is evident on the site of the original Rectory building. =Church= The 1838 church form has a brick hall (1932‚Äì34) complex grafted on to the western end of the church. There is evidence of ongoing adaptation of the original fabric, mostly due to structural instability resulting from the movement of the sandstone footings, on an almost continuous basis since its initial construction. The 1838 church building is unique in that it is built of sun dried bricks with stuccoed finish forming the walls. The surface of the walls are expressed to simulate stonework and have attached buttresses supported on sandstone footings integrated into the sandstone footings of the walls. The two buttresses flanking the western entry point to the church are constructed of stone and are of a different detail to the other buttresses. A set of stone stairs with bull nosed treads gives access at the eastern and western ends of the church. These are integrated into the stone plinth at the base of the walls, part of which is exposed and part of which is buried to form the footings. The vestry door fits within the proportions of the pointed arched window openings and has a single stone step for access to and from the vestry to the southern side of the church. The window sills at the base of the pointed openings is also a sandstone element. There is evidence of a history of patching the walls with brickwork forming a mosaic of bricks. The non- original brickwork is of an unknown extent but appears to have followed a pattern of rebuilding sections of the wall system where cracking has occurred. Also the original render has been replaced at different times with cement render in an attempt to further stabilise the dynamic nature of the building located on reactive soils of the Wianamatta Group. The Wianamatta Group sediments are generally 100 ‚Äì 190 metres deep and comprise stratified layers of shales and mudstones. The gabled roof form is constructed of timber frame with corrugated iron roof sheeting with ventilators on the ridgeline. Collar ties above the vaulted nave are in poor condition or have broken away from the main roof structure. Some of the rafters have extended by fixing adjacent sister rafters and would appear to indicate the outward movement of the roof system. The movement of the footings laid directly into the clay soils has created cracking to the wall fabric. This is particularly noticeable on the northern wall. The architectural composition of the form of the church is a symmetrical one with an emphasis on vertical openings, pointed arches, windows and recessed lancet mouldings surmounted with crenellated parapets to the bell tower and along the upper section of the sloping gables with terminating finials. A large central bell tower niche with pointed arches is a major architectural element of the eastern elevation of the church. One which was once terminated by a spire. The internal spaces consist a central nave with vaulted painted plaster ceilings and side aisles with flat painted plaster ceilings consisting ribbed joints and grided panels with centrally located quadrifid shaped vents set in painted timber panels. Large circular metal vent openings also penetrate the vaulted ceiling of the central nave along the central axis. These may date from the early Twentieth Century. The nave is defined not only by the ceiling treatments but by the two rows of timber columns which were gained locally from Ironbark trees from Gannon's Forest closer to the Cooks River. The existing columns are replacements as the original columns were partly eaten by white ants and were replaced in 1846 as was the floor. The columns are painted and have the names of the Bishops and clergy who were identified with the church painted just below the capital of the columns. The span of the nave also aligns with the original bell tower width at the eastern end of the church which has been modified to accommodate more direct access from the main road. A Chancel and the original Vestry space are accessed from a door on the southern side of the church and adjacent to the bell tower. At the eastern end a Cypress Pine floor is raised from the remainder of the church with both floor levels covered with carpet. At the western end an upper gallery exists and an entry space at the lower level complete with wooden screen, doors and access stair to the stepped upper floor of the Gallery. In the centre of the Gallery is located the Brindley and Foster pipe organ whose installation dates from 1880. Fixed pews are arranged on the stepped levels of the Gallery on the southern side of the organ and angled to obtain views into the main body of the church. The flooring of the Gallery appears to be Baltic Pine. The pointed window openings contain stained glass compositions and are commemorative of local families and individuals associated with the church. The large western window opening has been boarded over and painted to match the internal wall finish of the church. At the eastern end of the church is the timber panelled screen forming part of the chancel and separate lectern. A font is located in the north western corner of the main body of the church The internal walls are stuccoed and a painted dado line struck at the level of the window sills. The dado is painted in a contrasting colour and a similar treatment applies to the base of the freestanding and attached columns as well as following the line of the stairs up to the Gallery level. The wall surface is cracked in many places and to varying degrees however most appear to be on the northern wall. The walls also support many inscriptions in the form of various shaped panels and one built in is the original 1838 foundation stone which has been clearly adapted for commemoration in July1947 following its rediscovery in February 1947. The original main entry to the church at the western end has been obscured by the addition of the Hall (1932‚Äì34) as designed by Professor Leslie Wilkinson. This was built around an existing temporary hall which may have influenced the siting of the permanent structure. The Hall is a complex of a central squared symmetrical space with a fireplace on the eastern wall located on axis with the church together with linked ancillary spaces to the north and south. The northern space was intended as a stage while the southern space appears for the use of games. The symmetrical composition breaks down with the additional yet separate spaces of entry, Vestry, Kitchen, toilets and northern ancillary space off the stage. The Kitchen may have been added later. A further entry space is created between the Hall complex and the main western entrance into the church. The construction is of exposed brickwork and timber framed roof with tiled roof on the central hall and gabled wings and corrugated iron over the other separately expressed functions in the spirit of the Modernist movement. A timber floor links all of the internal spaces with a door from the stage area opening to the Creche room. The windows are timber framed, painted and set into internal rendered reveals with no external window sill. Where end wall brickwork is exposed the surface is rendered and unpainted with the exception of the kitchen. With the exception of the central hall space the walls are flush with the roof and the lack of weather protection has resulted in deterioration of the window frames externally. Cracking of the brickwork is evident in this structure as well as the church. The internal exposed brickwork of the central hall is distinguished from the other spaces by the use of a regular pattern of header courses running around the room. The header coursing in brickwork is used only over window and door openings externally with a projecting band of three brick courses at window height to define the stage area and the games area. The central hall has doors opening to the graveyard to the west by way of brick steps which leads to a small enclosure defined by roll top mesh fencing. The main entrance to the hall complex and the western end of the church is through a recessed archway designed to imitate the Old Colonial Gothick Picturesque style and located between the south western buttress and last pointed window of the church as well as forming part of the Hall complex. This appears to be constructed out of brickwork, rendered and painted in an attempt to match the church fabric. =Rectory= To the south are the 1906 Rectory building and associated yard, the 1996 Rectory building and its associated yard. The site of the original Rectory and outbuildings is a potential area of archaeological sensitivity due to the previous finding of brick fabric when excavations were made to connect services to a Pollution Sensor located within the fenced yard of the 1906 Rectory. The 1906 Rectory is representative of the Federation Period and appears to be relatively intact despite the intervention of new fence lines and the pollution sensor. Externally the single story brick building with complex hip and gable roof forms is sheeted in corrugated iron, displays some restrained patterned brickwork at window sill level complete with inscribed foundation stones built into the wall fabric. Some damaged veranda tile paving is evident together with some displaced slate edging. The traditional window hood is missing over the main window on the eastern gable front, although the line of flashing remains in situ. =Hall= The hall was designed by Professor Leslie Wilkinson, as confirmed by the original plans which are held by the parish, and an early sketch of its interior. =Churchyard= The site, which was originally 6 acres and 14 perch ( 2.43 hectares), has been subdivided through resumptions into an irregular shape with frontage to the Princes Highway to the east and Church Street to the north. The site is fenced along all boundaries except the frontage to Princes Highway which has a sandstone retaining wall which curves symmetrically inwards from the north and south to form the main entrance into the site and to terminate at the relocated row of four entrance pillars which once supported the iron gates which are now not extant. The sandstone wall, which appears to have been constructed from pre used blocks, dates from the 1927 road widening which eliminated 1 rood 28 perch off the original site area. A dwarf brick wall with engaged piers and bull nosed capping surmounted the sandstone retaining wall. The southern half of the front brick wall is missing as is part of the northern wall. Both north and south components of the front retaining wall are leaning to the east with cracking evident. Also leaning is the stepped rendered brick retaining wall defining the southern alignment of the concrete entrance drive. Both the wall and the drive have extensive cracking due to differential soil movement. A line of brush box trees (Lophostemon confertus) runs near the boundary fence to the Princes Highway. Photographs of the site up until the 1960s or 1970s showed few trees - one exception being a large Outaniqua or Yellow Wood (Afrocarpus falcatus), a South African coniferous tree near the southern entry to the church. An extensive array of trees was planted in the church yard from the 1960s and 1970s, comprising both exotic English oaks (Quercus robur) forming an avenue on the central axis entry off the Princes Highway towards the church's bell tower, and native trees. Natives include various eucalypts, such as ironbarks (Eucalyptus crebra), lemon- scented gums (Corymbia citriodora), spotted gums (Corymbia maculata) and Sydney blue gums (Eucalyptus saligna), rainforest trees such as brush box. water gum (Tristaniopsis laurina) and Illawarra flame tree (Brachychiton acerifolius). Cemetery The first burial in the graveyard, that of John Benfield, a soldier, took place on 4 March 1839,Grave Reflections by Laurel Horton, St Peters Publications, 1996. although the graveyard was not consecrated until 26 December 1840. The final burial, that of Sarah Ann Sargent, a widow, took place on 10 April 1896. In February 1948 an Act of the New South Wales Parliament (Act No. 48 of 1968) was passed authorising the use of the cemetery land for purposes other than a cemetery, including use as a rest park, a garden area and a recreation area. However no action was taken at the time and, in 1979, a permanent conservation order was placed on all of the church property by the Heritage Council of New South Wales. Since that time the congregation have undertaken voluntary maintenance of the cemetery grounds. A listing of all of the headstones was made in 1985 and photographs have been taken of many of the headstones.  Heritage listing  The St Peter's Church and grounds is of State heritage significance. It contains a rare and early example of Primitive Gothic Revival Church architecture in Australia. It contains a rare surviving work of the Colonial Period architect Thomas Bird (arrived Australia 1835) It contains one of the earliest churches to be constructed as a result of the Religious establishment Act of 1836. It contains evidence of the work and influence of a number of distinguished Australian architects: Thomas Bird, Edmund Blacket, James Hume, John Bibb, George Allen Mansfield, Blacket Brothers, Professor Leslie Wilkinson and Morton Herman. It contains one of the first churches to be constructed of free labour in NSW. It is a landmark within the Sydney environment contained within the greater landscape of Botany Bay. It formed an integral part of Alexander Brodie Spark's vision for an appropriate setting for the village of St Peters, Cooks River . St Peter's Church is a unique early form of building construction utilising sun dried bricks and local timber in the form of turpentine columns relating to the indigenous environment of the foreshores of Botany Bay and the Cooks River. The site has social significance due to its continuity of use and importance to the Anglican Church community since its formation in 1838. The site contains graves and remnant gave stones and monuments of significant persons including; A.B Spark, Henry Knight, Elizabeth Knight, Ann Knight, architect John Bibb, Thomas Gratten, James Raymond, grazier Thomas Icely, Susanna Hensley and descendants of Governor King amongst many local pioneers. The site contains a former rectory which is a good representative of the Federation Period with intact details and materials St Peter's Anglican Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The site, with its landmark church building and graveyard, is an integral part of the former village of St. Peters and village of Tempe, is the derivation of the name of the locale and strongly associated with its identity as a made place. The site has been occupied and used as an Anglican church facility since 1838. The site contains one of the earliest church buildings constructed by free labour and one of the earliest to be constructed as a result of the Religious Establishment Act 1836. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The church was designed by the Colonial period architect Thomas Bird and the built fabric added to altered by the work of subsequent notable architects: Edmund Blacket and sons, George Allen Mansfield, Professor Leslie Wilkinson and Morton Herman. Repair and reconstruction of damaged building fabric was supported by the congregation often with donations from local brickmakers. The establishment of the church was associated with Robert Campbell and Alexander Brodie Spark, two prominent Sydney Merchants and local landowners. The graveyard contains graves of prominent Sydney people The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The site contains fabric which demonstrates a high degree of creative achievement in the built form of the church, graveyard and Federation Period parsonage. The church is a good example of Old Colonial Gothick Picturesque despite its various additional works throughout the nineteenth century. The 1906 Parsonage is a good example of residential scale of the Arts and Crafts movement of the Federation Period and the graveyard contains a diversity of expression through the monumental tombs and commemorative gravesite markers. Together they form a landmark cultural landscape within the Marrickville municipality. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The site has local social significance because of its importance to the Church congregation and the community associated with St Peters Church. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site contains built fabric of a local technical significance for its potential to provide information into early construction methods including the use of sun dried bricks and local timber columns. It also provides good examples of the process of alteration, reconstruction and adaptation and displays an evolution of building and construction techniques. The site contains archaeological potential in the vicinity of the site of the original parsonage building complex. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site contains items of State significance and the church building has rare surviving fabric of the Old Colonial Gothic Picturesque architectural style and a nineteenth century graveyard. The remaining original Church form and some of its fabric is the only surviving built form designed by the Colonial Period architect, Thomas Bird, in Australia. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The site has state representative significance because it demonstrates principal characteristics of the work of prominent architects; Thomas Bird, Edmund Blacket, George Allen Mansfield and Professor Leslie Wilkinson.

This process is rhetorically effective when a rhetor presents a particular concept in a light that is favorable to the his/her interests by dissociating a term with any notions that do not serve the rhetor's purpose.

He is the member of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly from Sisamau. Incidents of hooliganism In June 2011, Solanki along with 20 others, forced his way into the office of woman IAS officer Ritu Maheshwari. He was arrested after a complaint was filed for misbehaving with her, and this led to his supporters clashing with the police in Kanpur. He later apologized. In May 2012, he was travelling in a car with tinted glass windows in the front, which is illegal under a Supreme Court ruling. When stopped by the traffic police in Faridabad, his hoodlums attempted to beat up the police. At the time, the incident was called \\"major embarrassment to UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, who had promised to end the hooliganism\\" associated with Samajwadi Party rule. He is convicted by session court for desecration of tricolour flag (tiranga jhanda) in tricolour cake cutting case (2011). Doctor's assault and statewide hospital closures, March 2014 On 28 February 2014, Solanki and his gunner severely assaulted Translated quote: dinesh goswami, 4th year student in GSVMMC: \\"Solanki's car was parked at a petrol pump. Two junior doctors were passing by it, when the door suddenly opened causing a near accident. In the following argument, Solanki's people beat up the doctors. A little later, Solanki's people and the police entered the medical college campus and beat up the doctors and professors.\\" According to Dr. Devendra Lalchandani, \\"The police beat up our students barbarically. Two students may have lost their limbs. Some have received dozens of fractures.\\" some junior doctors in Kanpur after a minor traffic accident near GSVM Medical College and the associated Hallett Hospital in Kanpur. Since it was near their hostel, a large group of students came out, and Solanki fled to a nearby police station. His car was damaged by the students. Subsequently, more than a hundred Samajwadi Party musclemen or goondas (maintained by political parties for instigating violence) entered the hostel and started beating up students and professors. A large team of policemen led by SSP Yashashvi Yadav entered the campus without attempting to seek permission - apparently they manhandled principal Dr. Navneet Kumar by his collar. The police beat up the students severely, and arrested 24 junior doctors and none of Solanki's men. Several students have multiple fractures, at least one has a life-threatening pelvic fracture, and some may become handicapped for life. The following morning, \\"shattered laptops, damaged medical books, broken chairs and tables and shattered mirrors\\" pointed to \\"the terror unleashed by the cops.\\" The magnitude of the violence caused widespread anger in the medical community, and thousands of doctors across the state struck work, protesting the \\"high-handedness\\" of the government. Medical colleges remained closed in Agra, Lucknow, Aligarh and other cities. Protests were held in AIIMS, Delhi and other parts of India. The matter was unresolved for four days, during which several dozen patients died. Intensifying the crisis, three hundred medical faculty resigned from their posts, seeking the release of 24 student doctors. The Indian Medical Association protested the \\"barbaric\\" police action and threatened a country-wide strike on 5 March. The IMA president Aarti Lalchandani was threatened by police in her house. and charged with inciting unrest.http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/UP-doctors- strike-continues-for-fourth-day/articleshow/31330062.cms Eventually, the chief minister Akhilesh Yadav met a delegation of doctors and appealed for calm, but no resolution could be reached since Solanki had not been arrested. Health services in all of Uttar Pradesh have been severely affected. On 3 March, the 24 arrested students refused to appeal for bail until action was taken against the police SP Yashashvi Yadav. Also, another 200 faculty members in the Medical College in Agra resigned. Talks between the doctors and health minister Ahmad Hasan failed. The stir caused closures of hospitals in NOIDA, near Delhi. The prestigious SGPGI, Lucknow was closed since 4 March, and all 800 beds were vacated. As the strike continues, opponent parties have declaimed the \\"goonda-raj\\" in the state, and demanded Solanki's arrest. A protest march by the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party was dispersed by a police lathicharge. Party chief and Akhilesh Yadav's father, Mulayam Singh Yadav condemned the manner in which his party was running the government. Five days into the conflict, the Indian Medical Association gave a deadline of 48 hours to the government for arresting Solanki and resolving the matter. =Judicial probe and withdrawal of strike= On 6 March, following a Public Interest Litigation, the Allahabad High Court ordered the UP Director-General of Police to probe the action of the police in the hostel raid, and that \\"he may proceed with disciplinary and departmental action against the police officers who are found to have erred\\". The court also ordered the State Government to transfer the top three police officers of Kanpur including SSP, Yashashvi Yadav, and also ordered an independent judicial probe by retired justice V.K. Mathur. However, the state government informed the court that they had already set up a one-person inquiry headed by retired justice RMS Chauhan, following which the court kept its order in abeyance. The state government also invoked the Essential Services Maintenance Act against the striking doctors. At the same time, Mulayam Singh Yadav reassured the doctors that all allegations against Solanki and others would be looked at sympathetically, Meanwhile, a First Information Report was filed against Irfan Solanki and others for the vicious attack on the medical students. He was charged with attempt to murder. Responding to the charges, Solanki held a press conference where he produced an old man. He claimed that this man was being beaten up ruthlessly by the junior doctors, and that he had merely stepped in to save him. At an earlier press conference, Solanki had worn a bandage and claimed that he himself had been beaten up and had to have six (or three) stitches on his head. However, a Zee News interviewer asked Solanki to show the stitches - and no stitches or hair removal could be shown. At the recent press conference also, he had no bandages. Following the legal developments and assurances, the doctors have withdrawn their strike. However, a group of junior doctors haves started a hunger strike demanding action against Solanki.

Since it spans a block, the Cable Building also has addresses of 2-18 West Houston Street and 178-188 Mercer Street.  Construction and design  Entrance at west side The Cable Building was built in 1892-1894. It is a steel and iron frame structure with brick, stone, and terra-cotta facing. It has a limestone base with a two-story arcade featuring show windows graced by iron spandrels and elegant keystones. It also has a prominent copper cornice with lions' faces, egg and dart moldings, and surmounting acanthus. It is believed to be the architectural firm McKim, Mead & White's first use of a complete steel frame in a commercial building. In an article published on May 7, 1892 under the heading of \\"The Beginning of the Transformation of Broadway\\", the publication of record for New York real estate, the Real Estate Record and Builders Guide, reported, \\"At the northwest corner of Houston Street the Broadway Cable Railroad Company (Broadway & Seventh Avenue Railroad Company) is constructing its big power station and business building from the plans of McKim, Mead & White. The contracts for this work above the foundations are still to be set.\\" When it was completed, the Real Estate Record and Builders Guide enthused that the new Cable Building is \\"conspicuous among the modern buildings that are fast imparting a new and grander appearance to Broadway....its architecture expresses distinctly the highest achievement of the art in this country at this time...The exterior of this magnificent structure is a product of American genius adapted to the needs of American commercial interests and is influenced by the Italian Renaissance in its style and proportions.\\" The publication further remarked that, with this example, \\"no excuse remains for building cheaply or meanly on any New York City property.\\" The article noted that the Metropolitan Traction Company occupied the top two floors of the building and had the other six 20,000 square foot floors for lease, which it thought would be especially appealing to those businesses who had their natural centre in the wholesale dry goods district. The Real Estate Record and Builders Guide gave special notice to the western entrance, saying: \\"Surmounting the charming and inviting entranceway is a round ornamental opening, making the centre to a group of two strongly modeled figures, which from their appearance and position are strongly suggestive in many ways of the Great Seal of the Empire State. These figures are 11 feet in height and are worthy of especial notice.\\" Above this entrance are two flanking draped female figures, which were created by the distinguished Scottish-American sculptor J. Massey Rhind the oval window had a large clock in it as shown in photos from ca 1920. Like the architect Stanford White, Rhind was a leader in the \\"American Renaissance\\" movement. The figure on the right holds a sword her in hand, the handle of which was broken off ca 1920s, it remained missing for decades until it was replaced incorrectly with a flame torch to match the figure on the left. Architects The Cable Building was designed by Stanford White, a partner in McKim, Mead & White, the preeminent American architectural firm at the turn of the twentieth century. It is a nine-story Beaux-Arts structure, which impressively captures White's design principles of the \\"American Renaissance\\". This is the only McKim, Mead & White building in the NoHo Historic District. The building's detailing is similar to two of the firm's earlier designs: the 1887 building at 900 Broadway, which Christopher Gray, writing in the New York Times called a \\"sleek, sophisticated amalgam of industrial-style brickwork\\"; and the long-gone 1890 Hotel Imperial, also built for the Goelet family, at Broadway and 32nd Street. Stanford White was the partner in charge for both of these projects for the family and was a close friend. The Cable Building's dual use as both a major powerhouse and an approximately 140,000 square-foot modern office building appears unique in the McKim, Mead & White portfolio. The firm, however, designed two other significant power house structures, both in New York State: the Adams Power Plant Transformer House, part of the historic Edward Dean Adams Power Plant, the first large-scale, alternating current electric generating plant in the world, built in 1895 to tap the power of Niagara Falls; and the IRT Powerhouse, the power station of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, located further uptown in Hell's Kitchen. However, both of these structures were single use, and most of McKim, Mead & White's prolific output was for public buildings or grand houses. Besides the Goelet Building among its few other office buildings is the Gorham Building, an Italian Renaissance Revival palazzo-style building at 390 Fifth Avenue at 36th Street in Murray Hill, for which Stanford White as also the partner-in-charge; and the New York Life Building in Kansas City, Missouri, which was fully replicated in Omaha, Nebraska as the Omaha National Bank Building. The latter two buildings are believed to be the only example in the McKim, Mead & White portfolio where one set of plans spawned two identical buildings. Of the twenty-nine American cities that built cable traction systems between 1870 and 1900 along with their accompanying cable powerhouses, this is the only powerhouse that was built by an architect of such stature, creating a building of enduring artistic refinement. A cable car powerhouse is usually a very utilitarian building, constructed for one clear purpose, as can be seen clearly in the LaSalle Street Cable Car Powerhouse in Chicago, or the Baltimore City Passenger Railway Power House and Car Barn. It was simply the mechanical back office of the cable railroad. In this instance, being situated on such a prominent street, Broadway, probably propelled the investors, with deep ties to New York business and real estate, to make a grand statement. Tenant \\"A Typical Cable 'Accident' on Broadway.\\" Introducing a new means of transportation in crowded New York City was not without its upheavals. The Cable Building was originally the headquarters and power station for the Metropolitan Traction Company, one of the city's cable car companies. MTC had been assembled in 1892 as a holding company for street railways, including the Broadway & Seventh Avenue Railroad. It was composed of a very powerful quartet, including the patriarch of the Whitney family, William Collins Whitney; an extremely wealthy financier, Thomas Fortune Ryan; Philadelphia industrialist Peter Arrell Brown Widener; and a major New York builder, John D. Crimmins. Their original investment in the building was $750,000. In all MTC spent $12 million on a cable car railway system to move cars on Broadway from Bowling Green to 36th Street. It was the most expensive system on a per- mile basis of any in the nation. When it became operational in the summer of 1893, its fleet comprised 125 cable cars and served 100,000 daily passengers. This was the central power station; other stations were at 51st Street and Front Street. The building's basement, which had been excavated 46' under the street surface, housed four 32-foot winding wheels that carried the cables that pulled the cable streetcars. They were powered by four Corliss steam engines 38\\" x 60\\", 1200 HP each, developed by the Dickson Manufacturing Company of Scranton, Pennsylvania. The upper seven floors contained offices arranged around a large internal court with two rectangular light wells. Less than ten years after it was finished and occupied, cable traction became obsolete in 1901 and the company switched to electricity, but the building retained its original name. The last Broadway cable car left the Battery Station at 8:27 PM on May 21, 1901. Its final journey marked the end of cable street transportation in New York City. Subsequently, the Metropolitan Traction Company went into receivership, and was reorganized the following year as the New York Railways Company. Recent history The New York Railways Company sold the building in 1925, and it was soon occupied by small businesses and manufacturers. From the 1940s to 1970s, the Cable Building housed mainly garment makers, which was the prevailing use in that area at the time. It was converted back to offices in 1983, with new ground-floor storefronts. M. D. Carlisle Real Estate has owned The Cable Building since 1985. The basement space that originally contained the cable powerhouse became the Angelika Film Center. They operate a multi-screen theater, which specializes in art house films. It was designed by architect Igor Josza and built by contractor Don Schimenti in 1989. Part of the ground floor and all of the second floor has been occupied since 2002 by a 40,217 square-foot Crate & Barrel store. Offices tenant the other seven floors. =Historic preservation= Drawing of the Cable Building in 1893 The building was designated as part of the NoHo Historic District in 1999 by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. The report stated: However, the Cable Building is not currently listed in its own right on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1973 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Built in 1903 the home was burned to the ground in 1975 and has since been restored, though not to its former grandeur. The restoration process is still ongoing. It is now operated as a bed and breakfast and event facility.  Background  Martin V. Beiger, born February 3, 1847, was Mishawaka's first millionaire. Martin made his fortune with the Mishawaka Woolen and Rubber Manufacturing Company, which would later become Ball Band then Uniroyal. He, along with his father Jacob Beiger, bought the small textiles mill in 1867. The mill originally had just 3 workers and mostly made flannels. He married Susie Higgins, the daughter of a local jeweler, in December 1875. In 1886 Martin Beiger, along with Adolphus Eberhart, patented the first all knit wool boot that did not lose shape or size. Demand for this product quickly grew the company. The boots were topped with a black band and, later, a red ball which became the companies trade mark. Ball Band went on to employ 5000 workers by 1923 and as many as 10000 in the 1940s. By 1903 the company had around 2000 employees and Martin had become very wealthy. Soon he and Susie were considering a more lavish home in the style of some of New Port Rhode Island's mansions, particularly that of The Breakers.  Mansion  Planning for a new home was begun in 1900, and construction on the -story neoclassical mansion began in 1903. Architectural plans were designed by Durham and Snyder, a company in South Bend, Indiana, and landscaping plans were designed by prominent landscape architect Jens Jensen. In the first year of construction, on September 26, 1903, Martin Beiger died at the age of 56 after an infection from an operation for appendicitus. Construction on the mansion was halted for a time, however Susie later decided to continue with construction and the mansion was completed in 1908 at a total cost of 100,000 dollars. The home is 21,790 square feet and originally had some 40 rooms. It has 11 unique fireplaces. Among the original rooms there were 11 bedrooms, 2 dining rooms, 2 kitchens, 2 sitting rooms, a billiards room, a library, a breakfast room, a solarium, a reception room, a ball room, a one-lane bowling alley, a museum, and a music room. The music room featured a three-manual Aeolian organ costing $25,000 at the time (about $700,000 in 2012). The 5th floor is a 2,000-square-foot area that originally housed the gardeners quarters. The mansion originally sat on nearly an entire block, and featured landscaped gardens and a full tennis court, built for her nephew. Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. The home was very modern for its time. It had electric lighting throughout, an internal bell system for calling the staff, a central vacuum system, and radiator and forced air heating. Originally the home was designed with an elevator in it; however, during construction it was decided to instead use the elevator shaft to increase the size of the safes. With time this would prove to be an important choice. The main safe on the second floor encompasses several hundred square feet of storage. All the safes were provided by the Mosler Safe Company of Cincinnati Ohio. The mansion featured several prized woods including, African mahogany, birds eye maple, and teak. Several of the rooms had large murals hand painted on silk. The first floor dining room had an Italianate scene, the library had a depiction of the birth of Christ from Ben Hur, and the breakfast room had a sunrise motif. Susie, along with a two nieces and nephew of hers, moved into the mansion in 1908. She lived well, with 6 servants, and entertained lavishly. Susie is reported to have had the first car in Mishawaka. SHe lived in the home until her death in 1927, when Ms. Beiger fell while walking down the main staircase in the home, breaking her hip. Susie died of complications due to this fall at the age of 68. =After the death of Ms. Beiger= Since she did not have any children Ms. Beiger left the mansion in trust as a home for the care of elderly women. Ms. Beiger willed 210 thousand dollars of her 1.55 million dollar estate to care for and maintain the home and its furnishings. The home for the care of the elderly was opened February 1, 1930. The home remained a care facility until its operation was no longer financially viable ceasing operation in 1967. During this time the surrounding grounds, which were originally an entire block, were sold off. To the south of the mansion, and on the original site of the tennis courts, lies the Dodge House for the Elderly which was built in 1933. By the late 1960s the future of the home was uncertain, and in 1972 it was slated for demolition to make way for used car lot. However, the local community along with the Mishawaka Historical Society banded together in order to save and restore the mansion. On September 7, 1973, the home was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. In the early morning on 20 January 1975, the mansion was burned to the ground in an unsolved arson. The terracotta roof collapsed through into the basement and nearly the entire home was destroyed. All that remained standing were the limestone walls, chimneys, and safes. The bulk of the valuable furniture and artifacts within were lost as well. Disastrously there was only a $75,000 insurance policy on the mansion, leaving its future again unclear. However, again the community moved to save the mansion. The recovery was slow. It took 4 years before a roof was again over the structure. By the mid- to late 1980s, the Historical Society had lost support and finances for preserving and restoring the mansion. On August 1, 1989, Ron Montandon purchased the mansion from the Historical Society. He has since worked to restore the mansion to its original grandeur. The current floor plan matches the original, and most of the landscaping is based on the original plans. Much of the current interior has been reproduced from pictures and accounts of the original home. In order to finance the restoration process, the mansion is currently operated as a 6-bedroom bed and breakfast and as an event facility known as the Beiger Mansion Inn. In February 2014 The Beiger Mansion Inn won the Mishawaka Business Association award for business of the year for 2013.

Following the Soviet model, a structure of regions and raions (districts) was created, replacing the former system of jude»õe (counties) and their subdivisions. Further changes were implemented during the 1950s and 1960s. History The administrative reorganisation was followed by a new territorial division of Romania. Preparations began in January 1949, with the opportunity of discussing the law about the so-called ' (People's Councils), when the leaders of the Romanian Workers' Party (PMR) decided to call on the help of the Soviet counselors for the division of the territory of the Romanian People's Republic into raions. Until then, Romania had been divided into jude»õe (counties), organised into plƒÉ»ôi and rural and urban ' (communes). The county, as a local administration form, has its origins in the medieval divisions of Wallachia. After the formation of modern-day Romania, the name extended over Moldavia also (1859), following Dobrudja (1878) and Transylvania (1923), the latter already having its own subdivision in counties under the Grand Principality of Transylvania. In the period of King Carol's dictatorship (1938-1940), the counties were abolished by forming 10 »õinuturi (lands). The chiaburi (the Romanian equivalent of kulaks) were the direct \\"target\\" of the administrative reforms. Discussions regarding the raionation were retaken at the Plenara CC (the Session of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party) between 15 and 17 May 1950, in the context of preparing the elections for the People's Councils. Some members of the CC were of the opinion that the division into counties should be maintained, because Romania didn't have the territory of the USSR to be divided into \\"regions\\". But Miron Constantinescu sustained that: \\"the term of raionation is the correct one, because it underlines the characteristic of this reorganisation and the expression used in Stalin's quote is raionation\\". Also, he presented the Report regarding the raionation to the Session, where he underlined the fact that \\"all of the content of the criteria proposed here is drawn up after the study of the Soviet material, on the basis of the Soviet teachings and on the basis of the concrete support that the Soviet counselors gave to us, to whom we thank for their help.\\" At the end of July a central commission of the Workers' Party (including Soviet counselors) was established to prepare the raionation of the territory. The raionation law was published on September 6, radically changing the administrative division of Romania. Instead of the 58 counties, 424 plƒÉ»ôi and 6,276 communes, the territory of the RPR was divided into 28 regions, 177 raions, 148 cities and towns and 4,052 communes. The process of raionation once finished, the governors organised the elections for the People's Councils on December 3, 1950. =Timeline= *September 6, 1950 - By Law nr. 5 the 58 counties (including the 424 plƒÉ»ôi and 6,276 rural and urban communes) were abolished, being replaced by 28 regions (composed of 177 raions, 148 cities and towns and 4,052 communes) *September 19, 1952 - Decree nr.331. By merging, the number of regions was reduced to 18: Arad, BacƒÉu, Baia Mare, B√¢rlad, Bucure»ôti, Cluj, Constan»õa, Craiova, Gala»õi, Hunedoara, Ia»ôi, Oradea, Pite»ôti, Ploie»ôti, Stalin, Suceava, Timi»ôoara and, for the first time after the Great Union, an administrative entity created on ethnic criteria, Regiunea AutonomƒÉ MaghiarƒÉ (The Magyar Autonomous Region);The Constitution of the People's Republic of Romania , 1952 *1956 - An intermediary step through which the regions Arad and B√¢rlad were abolished *1960 - The final step, with territory redistribution and region renamings. The Magyar administrative entity was renamed Regiunea Mure»ô-AutonomƒÉ MaghiarƒÉ (Mure»ô Region - Magyar Autonomous), also modifying its territory. In the end, the number of region was reduced to 16 *February 1968 - By the law adopted by Marea Adunare Na»õionalƒÉ (the Great National Assembly) the old county administrative and territorial division came into act. On January 14, 1968 a project-map was published and was discussed within the organizations of the Communist Party, subsequently undergoing some changes. The final result, substantially different from the original territorial organization prior to 1950, comprised 39 counties, the Bucharest municipality, 236 cities and towns, of which 47 municipalities and 2,706 communes having 13,149 villages.

The series premiered on 9 February 2015, and concluded four weeks later. It is adapted from the best-selling book Gallipoli by Les Carlyon. Gallipoli was produced by Endemol Australia and was shot over a three-month period commencing on 17 March 2014. Rehearsals began in early March 2014 and cast-members also undertook some military training in Melbourne before filming began. Filming took place in Melbourne and surrounding areas, including Bacchus Marsh and Werribee. The 25 April 1915 landing was recreated on the Mornington Peninsula. Premise The series centres on 17-year-old Thomas \\"Tolly\\" Johnson (Kodi Smit-McPhee), who lies about his age so he may enlist with his brother Bevan (Harry Greenwood) and ends up fighting at Gallipoli in the campaign that helped create the ANZAC legend. The story depicts the ten- month campaign in Turkey, highlighting the landing on 25 April 1915 by ANZAC troops who go into battle on the Gallipoli Peninsula. Landing in the dark, Tolly, Bevan, and their fellow soldiers of Australia's 4th Battalion endeavor to establish a defensible foothold beneath the treacherous slopes of the peninsula. The series follows both the battle and its aftermath. The soldiers spend eight months learning combat skills while trying to survive in the most difficult of circumstances. By the time of their final evacuation they have learnt much about themselves and their mates.

At the time of his capture, on June 19, 2016 in Paraguay, he had been at large since March 20, 2012 Career After working for the National Bank from 1996 to 2002, during which time he also became involved in the narcotics trade, he became a successful financier in 2006. He co-owns two firms, Od√≠n Concept SRL, a pharmaceutical house, in which his partner is Pablo H√©ctor Quaranta, and C&C; Building, a construction company, in which his partner is Mart√≠n Eduardo Lanatta. In May 2008, P√©rez Corradi became president of Elaboradora de Productos Biol√≥gicos S.A., while his ‚Äúright-hand man,‚Äù Jorge Cabrera, became director of the firm. Drug trafficking He is said to have trafficked in illegal narcotics, including ephedrine. One source describes him as a member of a ‚Äúcartel‚Äù that dealt in ‚Äúprecursor chemicals‚Äù; another identifies him as a member of a ‚Äúdrug mafia.‚Äù It has been reported that he got rich selling ephedrine to Mexicans, and that his suppliers were named Alfredo Abrahams and Josu√© Fucks (sic). In recent years, Perez Corradi's name has been raised in connection with many drug trafficking cases. A few months after the so-called General Rodriguez triple murder (see below) in August 2008, he was one of several high-profile figures investigated for ephedrine trafficking and illegal trade in medicines that were the basis for ephedrine and crystal meth. In August 2009, La Naci√≥n reported that the Federal Court of San Isidro had ordered the extradition of P√©rez Corradi to the United States. This order was a response to an order of capture issued by a court in the state of Maine, which accused P√©rez Corradi of having sent a parcel into the U.S. containing 80 oxycodone tablets, and which had led to the detention of P√©rez Corradi on October 22, 2008.http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1162652-ordenan-la-extradicion-de-perez- corradi-a-los-estados-unidos A request for his release was rejected in September 2010. In January 2011, the Buenos Aires Clarin reported that the Argentinian Supreme Court had approved the extradition of P√©rez Corradi to the United States on charges of trafficking in oxycodone, thus upholding the decision of the San Isidro court. Money laundering P√©rez Corradi, according to one source, laundered money through the Guinea Bissau consulate in Buenos Aires. In December 2010, Judge Norberto Oyarbide indicted P√©rez Corradi in Argentina for money laundering, in a case involving the assets of pharmaceutical entrepreneur N√©stor Lorenzo, arrested banking union leader Juan Jos√© Zanola, and the late Sebastian Forza. The charges also linked P√©rez Corradi with ephedrine trafficking and with a case involving tampered medicine. In 2011, P√©rez Corradi was placed in pretrial detention in Argentina on charges of money laundering. On December 15, 2011, he was released from prison after paying a bail of 100,000 pesos. At the time of his release, he was still facing the possibility of being extradited to the United States on drug trafficking charges. Triple murder On August 7, 2008, Sebasti√°n Forza, Damian Ferron, and Leopoldo Bina were murdered in a house in the Quilmes neighborhood of Buenos Aires. Their bodies were stored in a freezer and eventually thrown in a ditch in another part of the city, where they were found on August 13. The men were killed, according to one source, ‚Äúin perfect mafia style,‚Äù and all three of them had ties to the pharmaceutical business. Per√©z Corradi was reportedly in Canc√∫n at the time of the triple murder. On March 20, 2012, the Argentinian Ministry of Justice issued a warrant for P√©rez Corradi in connection with the triple murder, of which he is believed to be the mastermind. During the succeeding months, several raids were conducted in various places but P√©rez Corradi was not found. He remains a fugitive, and is named by Interpol as one of the world's most wanted fugitives. On December 20, 2012, two pairs of brothers, Martin and Cristian Lanatta and Victor and Marcelo Schillaci, were convicted of participation in the crime and sentenced to life in prison. The motive, according to the court, was that Forza, Ferron, and Bina's efforts to become involved in drug trafficking had threatened the narcotics trade of P√©rez Corradi and his business partner Martin Lanatta.http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201308/27948-a-cinco-anos-del-crimen-no- pueden-detener-al-profugo-perez-corradi.html The triple murder is the subject of a book, La Ejecuci√≥n: La historia secreta del triple crimen que desnud√≥ la conexi√≥n con la mafia de los medicamentos y la recaudaci√≥n de la campa√±a K (The Execution: The Secret History of the Triple Murder that Laid Bare the Connection with the Pharmaceutical Mafia and the K Campaign Fund). The book was written by Emilia Delfino and Rodrigo Alegre and published by Random House Mondadori in 2011. Corradi was reported detained in Paraguay on February 12, 2016; but it was reported later that he was still at large. He was captured in the Triple Border on June 9, 2016, with a new Paraguayan ID and with his fingerprints removed. The judges Sebasti√°n Casanello and Mar√≠a Servini de Cubr√≠a asked for his extradition: Casanello works on the triple crime case, and Servini de Cubr√≠a on a case of drugs trafficking. Corradi refused to be extradited, claiming that he does not trust the Argentine judiciary, that his family is in Paraguay, and that his life would be at risk if he returns. As a result, the extradition request may take two months to be answered. Personal life Perez Corradi has been described as a man of few words who keeps a low profile. ‚ÄúHe is not the sort who puts all his eggs in one basket.‚Äù He and his ex-wife, Liliana Raquel Aurehhuliu, have three children.http://www.uif.gov.ar/uif/index.php/es/noticias/475-nuevas-medidas- en-la-causa-contra-un-lavador-vinculado-a-la-mafia-de-medicamentos He is said to have a home in Pilar, in Buenos Aires, and another in Spain, which has proven ‚Äúvery useful‚Äù in connection with the export of illicit substances to Europe.

Donziger is currently under house arrest awaiting trial on charges of contempt of court in relation to the case, a move condemned by twenty-nine Nobel laureates as \\"judicial harassment\\" by Chevron. Early life and education Donziger's mother raised him in Jacksonville, Florida, where she took him to picket in support of Cesar Chavez's lettuce boycott. While Donziger was a child, his grandfather was a Brooklyn district attorney and judge. Donziger studied history at American University and worked as a journalist after graduating. His first job was in the United Press International bureau in Managua after which he freelanced in Nicaragua for The Fort Lauderdale News, the Toronto Star and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. After working for three years as a journalist, Donziger attended Harvard Law School, where he played basketball with Barack Obama. He worked as a public defender in Washington, D.C. during which time he produced a report on Iraqi civilian casualties in the Gulf War that was adopted by the United Nations. He visited Ecuador in 1993, two years after completing law school, where he says he saw \\"what honestly looked like an apocalyptic disaster,\\" including children walking barefoot down oil-covered roads and jungle lakes filled with oil. Class action lawsuit against Chevron Starting in the 1970's, Texaco conducted oil drilling operations in the Amazon in partnership with Ecuador's national oil company, Petroecuador. Texaco came to a $40 million agreement with Ecuador to clean up some of the resultant pollution. In 1993, after his visit to Ecuador, Donziger and other attorneys brought a class-action lawsuit in New York against Texaco on behalf of over 30,000 farmers and Indigenous people from the Amazon region. The lawyers chose to file in New York because, in 1993, Texaco's headquarters were in New York. The lawsuit charged that Texaco's oil drilling in the Amazon had resulted in massive contamination. Chevron bought Texaco in 2001 and argued that Texaco had cleaned up its area of operations and that its partner, Petroecuador, was responsible for any remaining pollution. Chevron requested that the case be tried in Ecuador and in 2002, US courts ruled that Ecuador had jurisdiction. The US court exacted a promise from Chevron that it would accept the decision of the Ecuadorian courts. When the case moved to Ecuador, Donziger conducted a public education campaign to inform Ecuadoreans about the pollution of the Amazon. He said that \\"the indigenous people would never get a fair trial in Ecuador if they did not illuminate what had happened to them and get public support\\". Donziger appeared in the 2009 documentary film Crude which explored a two year period in the case. A provincial Ecuadorean court found Chevron guilty in 2011 and awarded the plaintiffs $18 billion in damages. The decision was affirmed by three appellate courts including Ecuador‚Äôs highest court, the National Court of Justice, although the damages were reduced to $9.5 billion. In order to avoid paying the damages awarded by the court in Ecuador, Chevron moved its assets out of the country, leading the plaintiff's to seek enforcement actions in Canada, Brazil and Argentina for confiscation of Chevron's assets. A Wall Street Journal editorial stated that appeals courts in Argentina and Brazil‚Äôs Superior Court of Justice rejected Donziger's petitions to have the Ecuadorean judgement enforced. In 2017, a Canadian court held that the Ecuadorean plaintiffs could not be awarded assets of Chevron's Canadian subsidiary as the subsidiary was legally distinct from its US parent. In 2019, the Ecuadorean plaintiffs ended their Canadian lawsuit against Chevron. In 2011, Chevron filed a civil RICO suit against Donziger in New York City, accusing him of bribing an Ecuadorean judge, ghostwriting the damages judgment against it and fixing scientific studies. Chevron's civil suit initially sought $60 billion in damages which would have required a trial by jury. Chevron removed the request for damages two weeks prior to trial, allowing the case to be tried by judge alone. Chevron stated that it wanted to focus \\"the RICO case on obtaining injunctive relief against the furtherance of Donziger‚Äôs extortionate scheme against the company\\". U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan was assigned as the judge. In 2014, Donziger estimated that the legal fees Chevron was paying to appeal had already exceeded $2 billion. =Kaplan's 2014 ruling in the RICO case= In 2014, Kaplan ruled that the judgement in Ecuador was invalid because Donziger had achieved it through offenses against legal ethics, including racketeering, extortion, wire fraud, money laundering, obstruction of justice, judicial bribery, coercion, witness tampering and arranging for expert‚Äôs reports to be ghostwritten. Kaplan said the process in Ecuador was \\"not fair or impartial and did not comport with the requirements of due process\\" and was \\"not entitled to recognition\\". In subsequent defences of the ruling, Kaplan referred to the Ecuadorians involved in the class action suit as \\"so-called plaintiffs\\". The case relied in large part on the testimony of Alberto Guerra, a former Ecuadorean judge whom Chevron had moved to the United States from Ecuador in 2013 for safety reasons. Chevron paid for immigration lawyers for Guerra and his family and provided him with a monthly salary of $12,000 for housing and living expenses. In the RICO trial, Guerra alleged that Donziger had arranged for him to ghostwrite the verdict that was delivered against Chevron in Ecuador. Guerra stated that the judge who heard the case signed the verdict which Guerra had prepared and the two shared a payment of $500,000 from the plaintiffs, led by Donziger. In Kaplan's conclusion to the RICO case, he highlighted this as primary evidence for the racketeering charge. In his judgment, Kaplan wrote that \\"Guerra on many occasions has acted deceitfully and broken the law [‚Ä¶] but that does not necessarily mean that it should be disregarded wholesale\\". He found that the \\"evidence leads to one conclusion: Guerra told the truth regarding the bribe and the essential fact as to who wrote the Judgment.\\" In 2015, Guerra testified to an international tribunal that he had lied and changed his story multiple times in the RICO trial. Guerra admitted that there was no evidence supporting the allegation that Donziger bribed him or paid him for a ghostwritten judgment, and that large parts Guerra's testimony in the RICO case were either exaggerated or untrue. In 2016, a Second Circuit Court of Appeals declined to consider Guerra's admissions and unanimously upheld Kaplan‚Äôs ruling. Kaplan described Donziger‚Äôs conduct as \\"criminal\\" in his 2014 ruling, but the U.S. Attorney‚Äôs office for the Southern District of New York declined to prosecute him. =Donziger's disbarment in New York= Donziger was suspended from practicing law in New York in July 2018 based on rulings by U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan in the Chevron case. An independent legal referee recommended his reinstatement in February 2020. An appeals court ruled in August 2020 that the referee had been too lenient, disbarring Donziger in New York. Martin Garbus, Donziger‚Äôs lawyer, said the decision deprives Ecuadorians represented by Donzinger of their main advocate and singles Donziger out ‚Äúbecause he so threatens Chevron and the fossil fuel industry‚Äù. =Criminal contempt charge= As part of the appeal process after the initial ruling, Kaplan ordered Donziger to submit his computer, phones and other electronic devices to Chevron to allow it to search for his assets. Donziger refused, arguing that doing so would violate the attorney-client privilege of his clients, and appealed the order on constitutional grounds. While Donziger's appeal against the order was pending, Kaplan charged him with six counts of criminal contempt of court. The contempt charges allege that Donziger failed to comply with Kaplan's orders to submit his electronic devices and passport and to drop attempts to collect on the award against Chevron. In a move described as \\"virtually unprecedented\\" by The Intercept, Kaplan appointed a private law firm, Seward & Kissel, to prosecute Donziger after the Southern District Court of New York declined to do so. Jacobin magazine noted that Seward & Kissel is a private firm that has represented Chevron directly as recently as 2018. Chris Hedges wrote that neither Kaplan nor Seward & Kissel disclosed that Chevron had been a client. Rather than using the standard random assignment process for choosing a judge to preside over Donziger's trial for criminal contempt, Kaplan chose senior District Judge Loretta Preska. In August 2019, Preska sentenced Donziger to home detention while awaiting trial and ordered the seizure of his passport. He was required to wear a GPS-powered ankle bracelet. Preska ordered Donziger to post a bail bond of $800,000, which is a record for a misdemeanour case in the US. In May 2020, Preska ruled that Donziger's case would not be heard by a jury, which Donziger had requested. The U.S. District court disqualified two of Donziger's attorneys from appearing for him in the contempt trial. In August 2020, after two other attorney's were unable to appear in the trial, Preska ordered Donziger's former lead defence attorney, Andrew Frisch, to represent him. Martin Garbus, who also represents Donziger but was unable to attend the trial said a trial with Frisch would not be \\"a constitutionally protected case\\" and that \\"Donziger is being forced to go to trial with a lawyer who doesn't want to be in the case, who doesn't get along with Donziger, and claims that before Donziger goes ahead with the trial he should pay him additional moneys\\". The contempt case is scheduled to begin in September 2020. =Reactions= In 2018, a Wall Street Journal editorial stated that \\"Donziger‚Äôs attempted looting of Chevron for spurious environmental crimes in Ecuador ranks among the biggest legal scams in history\\". The editorial said Donziger's disbarment was \\"a step toward reining in Mr. Donziger‚Äôs marauding\\". Donziger's contempt charge and house arrest have been harshly condemned by legal advocates. Lawyer's Rights Watch Canada points out that Donziger has been under house arrest for longer than the six month maximum sentence that contempt of court carries. Harvard Law School professor Charles Nesson criticized Chevron and Kaplan, stating that the corruption and bribery charges were a \\"means to protect the oil company from having to answer for its degradation of the Amazon\\". In 2020, a group of twenty-nine Nobel laureates condemned \\"judicial harassment\\" by Chevron and urged the release of Donziger. Human rights campaigners described the treatment of Donziger as an example of a strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP), which are used to censor, intimidate, and silence critics by burdening them with the cost of a legal defense until they abandon their criticism or opposition. The European Parliament, one of the three branches of the European Union, requested that the Congressional Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties investigate Chevron's treatment of Donziger as \\"not consistent with what has traditionally been the strong support in the United States for the rule of law generally and for protection for human rights defenders in particular\\". In an August 2020 article, Chris Hedges detailed the measures taken by Chevron to pressure mainstream media outlets, including Fox News, GQ magazine and The New York Times, to drop stories about the Chevron and Donziger litigation.

The starting year of his reign is uncertain, but he reigned his principality from around 1073 or 1077. His former allies, the Cumans killed him after their unsuccessful joint campaign against his uncle, Vsevolod I of Kiev. Life Principalities in the Kievan Rus' (1054-1132) Roman was the son of Sviatoslav Iaroslavich, Prince of Chernigov and his first wife, Killikiya. The order of seniority of Sviatoslav's four sons by Killikiya is uncertain: Roman might have been the second or fourth among them. According to historian Martin Dimnik, he was born around 1052. He was named after his father's saintly uncle, Boris whose baptismal name was Roman. The starting year of Roman's reign in Tmutarakan cannot certainly be determined. According to Martin, he seems to have succeeded his brother Oleg who moved to Vladimir after their father became Grand Prince of Kiev in 1073. However, no source makes mention of Oleg's or Roman's reign in Tmutarakan in this period. The Russian Primary Chronicle writes that Boris Vyacheslavich \\"fled to join Roman in Tmutorakan\\"Russian Primary Chronicle (year 6585), p. 165. after reigning in Chernigov for eight days in May 1077. In less than a year, Roman's brother, Oleg also settled in Tmutarakan. Boris and Oleg allied with the Cumans against their uncle, Vsevolod, who had seized Chernigov. However, they were defeated on 25 August. In the summer of 1079, Roman made an alliance with the Cumans against Vsevolod. They advanced as far as the confluence of the rivers Sula and Dnieper, but Vsevolod made a peace with the Cumans, forcing Roman to withdraw. While he was returning to Tmutarakan, the Cumans murdered him on 2 August. No source makes mention of Roman's marriage or his descendants, implying that he never married and died childless.

Schapiro took lessons with W. Eugene Smith, an influential photographer during the Second World War. Smith taught him the technical skills and showed him how to develop his own views of the world and of photography. Schapiro's work reflects the influence of his teacher. In 1961 Schapiro began working as a freelance photographer. His photos were published in Life, Vanity Fair, Sports Illustrated, Newsweek, Time and Paris Match. The political, cultural and social changes of the 1960s in the United States were an inspiration for Schapiro. He accompanied Robert F. Kennedy during his presidential campaign and captured key moments of the civil rights movement such as the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom or the Selma to Montgomery marches. Schapiro not only worked in the fields of photojournalism and documentation, but also became a real activist. This is, for instance, visible in his way of documenting the hard lives of immigrant workers from Arkansas he dealt with in 1961. In the 1970s, Schapiro focused more on film set photography. Having taken photos of Midnight Cowboy (1968), among them also a famous one of Dustin Hoffman, he was hired as a photographer by Paramount Pictures. He photographed on the set of The Godfather (1972) by Francis Ford Coppola with a cast including Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall. One of his photographs is of \\"Marlon Brando and the Cat\\". Schapiro was also present at the film set of Chinatown (1974) by Roman Polanski. Two years later, Schapiro was ‚Äì by request of Robert De Niro ‚Äì hired as a photographer on the set of Martin Scorsese's movie Taxi Driver (1976). Schapiro captured key moments of modern American history with his photos that also reflect his own social and human awareness.

It has been classified as a type of enargia (a synonym to ‚Äúhypotyposis‚Äù), which is a ‚Äúgeneric name for a group of figures aiming at vivid, lively description‚Äù. Edgar Allan Poe used enargia frequently to describe his characters in his literary works. According to Philip Hardie, a professor at the University of Cambridge, its determining characteristic is its position within a text. Normally, when the descriptive analysis of a place is found to discontinue a narrative, this interrupting section can be considered topothesia. In addition, it has a stereotyped entry formula that facilitates distinguishing the narrative from the descriptive. In most famous texts, topothesia begins with est locus (‚Äúthere is a place‚Äù in Latin), as can be seen in Metamorphoses by Ovid.  Etymology  Topothesia is derived from a mixture of two Greek words: ‚Äútopos‚Äù (œÑŒøœÄŒøœÇ), which literally translated means ‚Äúplace‚Äù, and the suffix ‚Äú-thesia‚Äù, which is obtained from the noun \\"thesis\\", meaning ‚Äúsetting forth\\". In ancient Greek the word always seems to refer to the description or arrangement of a real place,Liddell-Scott-Jones, Greek-English Lexicon, 9th ed. s.v. while the application of the word to an imaginary description (as opposed to \\"topographia\\", the description of a real place) is first found in the Latin commentator Servius.On Vergil's Aeneid 1.159  Examples  Topothesia is a tool often used in poetry rather than by orators. A renowned poet who frequently utilized topothesia along with other forms of enargia was Edgar Allan Poe. A popular poem that featured various examples of topothesia is ‚ÄúDreamland‚Äù. > :By a route obscure and lonely, :Haunted by ill angels only, :Where an > Eidolon, named Night, :On a black throne reigns upright, :I have reached > these lands but newly :From an ultimate dim Thule- :From a wild clime that > lieth, sublime, :Out of Space ‚Äì Out of Time. :Bottomless vales and boundless > floods, :And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods, :With forms that no man can > discover :For the tears that drip all over; :Mountains toppling evermore > :Into seas without a shore; :Seas that restlessly aspire, :Surging, unto > skies of fire; :Lakes that endlessly outspread :Their lone waters- lone and > dead,- :Their still waters- still and chilly :With the snows of the lolling > lily. (‚ÄúDream-Land,‚Äù 7:89) However, this rhetorical term was apparent in other of Poe's works of fiction like ‚ÄúThe Domain of Arnheim‚Äù. This short story was recognized for its repeated use of topothesia. According to author and professor at York University, Brett Zimmerman, ‚Äúthe tale‚Äôs entire second half is a description of Arnheim, an artificial paradise on Earth ‚Äì ‚Äúthe phantom handiwork, conjointly, of the Sylphs, of the Fairies, of the Genii, and of the Gnomes‚Äù (6: 196). We also have ‚ÄúLandor‚Äôs Cottage: A Pendant to ‚ÄòThe Domain of Arnheim‚Äô.‚Äù That piece really has no plot; it is extended topothesia ‚Äì an exercise in picturesque description of a place‚Ä¶‚Äù  Notes   References  = Primary Sources = * * = Secondary Sources =   * Category:Poetry Category:Rhetoric ","title":"Topothesia"},{"id":"42117581","text":"Corona is an Italian surname from Latin, meaning top of the head, crown.

History The Piotrk√≥w Ghetto was the first wartime ghetto of its kind. Set up in one of Poland's oldest cities with a thriving Jewish community, it took until late January 1940 for the new inmates to move into it.Piotrkow Trybunalski Ghetto. ARC 2005. Sources: Gutman, Gilbert, Gill, Trunk. First, the Judenrat (Jewish Council) was established and ordered to issue an announcement about the relocation, but this had no effect. Consequently, the Germans themselves evicted the Jews from their homes, transferring them to the ghetto by force. Eventually, up to 28,000 Jews were squeezed into a part of town where only 6,000 people previously lived. The homes vacated by the Jews were assigned to Christians and members of the German minority who took over their businesses after the relocation. It was an open type ghetto ‚Äì- an early variant of Nazi ghettoization -‚Äì without the barbed wire fences introduced later throughout all of occupied Poland. Only warning signs with skulls were placed along the boundaries, and the main gate erected. The ghetto was pronounced closed from the outside on . The initial population of about 10,000 Jews were not required to use permits to move around town, but shootings by Ordnungspolizei became commonplace and a curfew in the ghetto was introduced. The influx of refugees expelled from other places, including Warsaw, ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Be≈Çchat√≥w, Kalisz, Gniezno and P≈Çock, caused the ghetto population to more than double by 1942. Jews were not allowed to use main streets. Many were sent as slave labor to prewar factories taken over by the Germans, including Hortensja Glassworks (pl), the Kara industrial glass factory, and the Bugaj wood factory on the lake (pl). Captured Jews were sent to build new fortifications and ditches. More Jewish refugees and displaced persons came from neighbouring villages as well. Liquidation of the ghetto Commemorative plaque at the former historic Jewish cemetery The ghetto liquidation action began on the night of , commanded by SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Willy Blum. About 1,000 Jews unable to move were shot in their homes for \\"insubordination\\". By the next morning, some 22,000 Jews were herded onto the square by the Synagogue in order to undergo a \\"selection\\". In the course of the next few days, Jews were marched in columns to the railway station and loaded onto the awaiting freight trains without food or water, 150 to one car. Following the 1942 deportations to Majdanek and Treblinka death camps, some 3,500 Jewish factory workers still remained in the small Ghetto. However, mass executions became more frequent in 1943, even inside the depleted Synagogue, in the Jewish cemetery, and at an execution site near Rak√≥w. By 1944 only 1,000 Jews were still alive. As the Soviet front began to approach, they were loaded onto freight trains and sent to Buchenwald and Ravensbr√ºck, never to return.

He never abandoned his childhood dream of becoming a manga artist completely, however, and his professional debut as a manga creator came in 1969 with the publication of his manga interpretation of Puss 'n Boots, which was serialized in 12 weekly instalments in the Sunday edition of Tokyo Shimbun, from January to March 1969. Printed in colour and created for promotional purposes in conjunction with his work on Toei's animated film of the same title, directed by Kimio Yabuki. In 1969 pseudonymous serialization also started of Miyazaki's original manga '. This strip was created in the style of, , he read, in boys' magazines and Tank≈çbon volumes, while growing up, such as Soji Yamakawa's ' and in particular Tetsuji Fukushima's '. Miyazaki's Desert People is a continuation of that tradition. In People of the Desert expository text is presented separately from the monochrome artwork but Miyazaki progressively used additional text balloons inside the panels for dialogue. People of the Desert was serialized in 26 weekly instalments which were printed in ', a publication of the Japanese Communist Party, between September 12, 1969 (Issue 28) and March 15, 1970 (issue 53). The strip was published under the pseudonym . The strip has been identified as a precursor for Miyazaki's manga Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind (1982‚Äì1995) and the one-off graphic novel The Journey of Shuna (1983), published by Tokuma Shoten.

The heavy-duty sculpture, together with the base platform, stand over 13 meters (42 feet) tall and weights approximately 40 tonnes. On a wall just behind the monument, the phrase \\"Workers of the world, unite!\\" (from the Communist Manifesto) is inscripted in four languages: German, English, French and Russian. It is the most famous monument in the inner city of Chemnitz and the second-largest bust in the world, after the 60 cm higher Lenin's head in Ulan-Ude, Russia. There is a well known local nickname for the monument: \\"Nischel\\", which is derived from the Central German term for head or skull.  History  After renaming the city and the district of Chemnitz into Karl-Marx-Stadt on May 10, 1953 for Karl Marx Year, the East- German government decided to honour the namesake of the city, and hired a Soviet sculptor, Lev Kerbel, to design a monument. The monument was cast in the art foundry Monument Skulptura in Leningrad in bronze and then broken down into 95 pieces. In Karl-Marx-Stadt, these items were to be welded together again, but the Soviet technology was not suitable. Instead, it was decided to transfer the job to the VEB Germania. The monument stands on two pedestals with Korninskij granite, named after the mining region in southern Ukraine. On 9 October 1971, the monument was inaugurated before a crowd of around 250,000 people along Karl-Marx-Allee (popularly referred to as \\"Nischelgasse\\" (\\"Skull Alley\\"), today's Br√ºckenstra√üe). As the landmark of the city, it served during holidays in the German Democratic Republic as a backdrop for pageants and other mass events. The monument remained intact even after German reunification, although the proposed demolition of the monument led to a heated debate when Karl-Marx-Stadt returned to its former name of Chemnitz. Many other cities around the world at that time reported interest in buying the monument, there have been discussions about a sale to Cologne. Until 2007, the motto of the city was \\"Stadt mit K√∂pfchen\\" (the city with heads/brains), referring to the monument.

Pocko has three main fields of operation: publishing ‚Äì under their publishing arm, Pocko Editions; a communication and creative consultancy, Pocko Lab; and a talent agency, Pocko People ‚Äì representing illustrators, graphic designers, animators and photographers.  History  Pocko was founded in 1999 by Royal College of Arts photography graduate, Nicola Schwartz. Pocko's first initiative was the Pocko Collection in collaboration with Diesel in 2002, a series of pocket size books composed by different artists. The mini books with ten titles showcased talented illustrators and photographers, with a few designed as pull out postcards. The books were retailed in Selfridges, and were the first selection of widely distributed art to combine publishing with brand communication.  Communications and creative work  Pocko Labs' former clients have included a variety of international companies from Disney, MTV, Paramount Comedy 1, the New York Times, Chronicle Books, BMW Oracle Racing, to Eni and IBM. Major clients in the design, fashion, and retail industry include household names such as Iittala, Gas Jeans, Comme des Garcons, Marc Jacobs, Cacharel, Alexander McQueen, Diesel, Selfridges, L'Or√©al, and Top Shop. Pocko has also created work for charities such as National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and the Bambino Ges√π Hospital, a noted children's hospital in Rome. Recent notable projects include an animation film made in collaboration with illustrator Klaus Haapaniemi for Finnish design company Iittala's new ceramic tableware collection \\"Tanssi\\" (meaning \\"dance\\" in Finnish). The Tanssi animation and ceramic range was created in conjunction with a new production at the Finnish National Opera of Czech composer Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek's The Cunning Little Vixen, for which Klaus Haapaniemi also designed the set design and costumes. The main inspiration for the animation came from Haapaniemi's work for the opera production: \\"Klaus had done stage design before and so we started looking at shadow puppets. We liked this resolutely 2D look... because it would stand out from all the high tech 3D animation out there. From there we hit upon a combination of Eastern shadow puppets and Victorian magic lantern shows, along with the richness of Baroque patterns, textures and character exuberance that appears in the Tanssi range\\".http://dotmogo.com/animation/pocko-tanssi-animation-iittala/  Publishing  Pocko's publishing work is developed under the title Pocko Editions, and focuses on publishing illustrative and image-oriented books relating to contemporary popular culture and art. Pocko Editions' publishing credits include Keaton Henson's wordless graphic novel \\"Gloaming\\", Stacy Hardy's short story collection \\"Because the Night\\", and recording artist MIA's collection of innovative personal paintings titled \\"M.I.A.: No. 10\\".https://www.amazon.co.uk/M-I-A-No-10-Maya-Arulpragasam/dp/190397710X = Pocko Collection = Pocko Collection is a series of pocketable books that 'merge art and design within the fuzzy borders of contemporary culture'.http://www.tangents.co.uk/tangents/main/2001/oct/pocko.html The collection currently contains 18 books split across three series: 1 (2001), 2 (2002), 3 (2003). \\"The series feature a wide range of talent from Japan, Spain, Italy, Israel, USA and Scotland ... upcoming releases will draw work from Finland, Sri Lanka, South Africa and Ukraine\\", with contributing authors Adam Lowe, Klaus Haapaniemi, Maya MIA Arulpragasam, Paul McDevitt, Hiro Sugiyama, Ori Gersht, and Tracey Ferguson. According to an interview in Frieze Magazine (March 2003) Pocko Editions' goal was \\"to publish 96 books over the next ten years, regardless of the indications of their accountants' spreadsheets\\".http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/palm_reading/ Pocko Collection was partly funded by the clothing company Diesel. = Kenton Heason ‚Äì Gloaming = In 2012 Pocko Published English graphic illustrator and blues musician Keaton Henson's visual journey Gloaming. The graphic novel's inspiration is born from old Scandinavian folklore and Japanese Kwaidan (ghost stories) from the Edo period. The author describes Gloaming as \\"a study of the things we cannot see. It is an ode to the suburbs and the creatures that come to life within its mundanity.\\" Coinciding with the release of his graphic novel, Pocko produced an exhibition/performance of the same name at London's Blackall Studios. The exhibition featured a range of original drawings from Keaton, and centred around a unique and intimate one-on-one live performance from Keaton, who struggles with playing live in a conventional sense. Guardian writer Robbie Wojciechowski described the \\"magical\\" exhibition as \\"The deep guilt you feel inside you wants Keaton to share his soul with you, and he does, happily, sitting upon a stool staring out at you. You sit, you wait, he plays, and your hearts broken ‚Äì all in less than five minutes. You spend your time, post performance, realising that you‚Äôll never get to see an experience that parallels this\\". = Stacy Hardy ‚Äì Because the Night = In 2015 Pocko published South African journalist, writer, and multimedia artist Stacy Hardy's Because the Night \\"part book, part art object\\" it consists of a collection of short stories with photography by Mario Pischedda. In an interview with the South African Journalist Hardy describes the project as \\"dealing with themes around the body, sexuality, gender and politics and trying to navigate that in the confused, weird space that is South Africa. It sits in the space between confessional literature and experimental interface\\". She emphasises the importance of the collaboration with Mario Pischedda photographs as \\"colliding against mine and in that conclusion evoke new meanings. There is wonderful play between his masculinity and my femininity that makes for friction and cohesion, conflict and beauty‚Ä¶ it's a bit like a love affair on the book's pages\\". The book received critical acclaim and was widely featured in South African press, hailed as \\"Risky, brave and beautiful, this collection sets a new standard for the South African short story\\" that \\"challenges the fetishization and objectification of the female body\\". The Mail & Guardian argued that Because the Night \\"must be celebrated for stretching the boundaries of \\"acceptable\\" female experience in literature. It offers an empowering, escapist journey for women, especially relevant to a South African readership, where perceived danger lurking in dark public spaces severely curtails women's mobility and expression\\". The book has also received strong reviews in the international press with noted American author Noy Holland praising the collection saying: ‚ÄúOne can read a long way into the literature of any continent and find little which speaks so powerfully and with such candor about the life of body, the quickness of the mind to depart, as Because the Night.‚Äù = Other published works = *Klaus Haapaniemi ‚Äì Giants (2004) *Yuko Kono ‚Äì Too Fat, Can't Fly and other stories (2004) *Daisy de Villeneuve ‚Äì He Said, She Said the Journal (2005) *Daisy de Villeneuve ‚Äì I Told You So (2005) *Fukiko Yamamoto ‚Äì Kika My First Word Book (2006) *Tamed & Pocko ‚Äì Blade (2007) *Bartolomeo Pietromarchi ‚Äì Nuclear Voyage (2007) *Federico Brugia ‚Äì FIFTY-ONE (2008) *Pocko Times Magazine Vol. 1: Metropolis (2009) *Pocko Times Magazine Vol. 2: Big is Small (2010) *Pocko Times Magazine Vol. 3: Light Works (2011)  Exhibitions  Pocko Gallery is \\"a curatorial entity which develops exhibition projects based around themes inspired by contemporary culture\\", displaying a variety of work from illustration, photography, and graphic artists.

Measurement usually involves inserting a sensor into the substance to be tested and then applying either Standard Waveform Analysis to determine the average moisture content along the sensor or Profile Analysis to provide moisture content at discrete points along the sensor. A spatial location can be achieved by appropriate installation of several sensors. Functional principle of a TDR meter  Standard Waveform Analysis  A TDR waveguide with exposed wires In the waveform analysis a sensor (usually a probe) is placed in the material to be tested. The sensor contains a waveguide consisting of two or three parallel wires which is connected via a coaxial cable to a voltage pulse generator which sends precisely defined voltage pulses into the sensor. As the pulse travels along the waveguide its progress varies depending on the moisture content of the material being examined. When the pulse reaches the end of the waveguide it is reflected. This reflection is visualised in a TDR waveform using an oscilloscope connected to the sensor. The intensity of the pulse in the probe is measured and related to moisture content, with higher voltage indicating an increase of moisture. By comparing the measured reflection to the initial pulse the average moisture content and relative permitivity of the sample can be calculated by using an equivalent circuit as a reference. Standard waveform analysis can be used either manually (hand held instruments) or automatically for monitoring moisture content in several areas such as hydrology, agriculture and construction.  Profile Analysis  Standard Waveform Analysis is unable to provide a spatial moisture profile. More sophisticated methods such as Profile Analysis are required. This method uses a variety of techniques to add spatial information to the measurement results. * Reconstruction algorithm: One approach is to model the pulse propagation in the waveguide and calibrate the model against laboratory measurement. By comparing real sample measurements to the model, the moisture distribution can be inferred. :The usefulness of this method is limited by the complexity of the algorithms, the limited amplitude resolution and interference in the TDR equipment. * Alteration of Cross Section: Altering the cross section of the waveguide alters the pulse reflections and creates artificial reflections at each alteration of the cross section. This enables segmentations of the waveguide by applying a different cross section to each segment. :However the difficulty of distinguishing the artificial pulse reflection from a real variance prevents the use of this technique for automated data analysis. Moisture detection in buildings using profile analysis * Subdivision: The waveguide is subdivided into segments by using PIN diodes. Each segment provides its own pulse reflection thus showing the moisture content in that segment alone. This enables the moisture content to be mapped to the individual segments and therefore shows the spatial moisture distribution. :As the length of the waveguide increases the reflections become weaker and eventually disappear. This limits the use of this method as do the influence of the diode circuit on the signal and manufacturing costs associated with the complexity of the waveguide compared to other methods. * Length Variation: This method uses several waveguides with different lengths mounted parallel to each other. As a separate waveguide must be connected for each area, the costs of this method are very high. Profile analysis allows fully automatic measurement and monitoring of spatial moisture content and thus a leak monitoring of building foundations, landfill barriers and geological repositories in salt mines.

The front ran along the Yser river (IJzer) and Yser Canal (Ieperlee) in the far north-west of Belgium and defended a small strip of the country which remained unoccupied. The front was established following the Battle of the Yser in October 1914, when the Belgian army succeeded in stopping the German advance after months of retreat and remained largely static for the duration of the war. Background During the early campaigns of 1914, the Belgian army had been pushed out of the fortified cities of Li√®ge, Namur and Antwerp by the German advance. Although they succeeded in delaying the Germans at some actions, they were forced to withdraw, first to Antwerp, and into the far north-west of Belgium. By October 1914, the Belgian forces were holding a position along the Yser and Ieperlee canal. After months of retreat, the Belgian forces were considerably reduced and were exhausted. They flooded a large expanse of territory in front of their lines, stretching as far south as Diksmuide. Between 16 and 31 October 1914, the Belgians held off the German army at the Battle of the Yser, suffering 3,500 killed and 15,000 wounded. The Battle of the Yser established a front line which would endure until 1918. Geography Battlefront in Flanders in 1914 The Yser Front stretched along a distance of around from the Belgian North Sea coast between Nieuwpoort and Westende, stretching south-east along the Ieperlee, encompassing both Ramskapelle and Pervijze. From Pervijze, the line then arched south-east between the Yser and Ieperlee, down to Oudekapelle and Reninge. Diksmuide had fallen to German forces shortly before the Battle of the Yser. The front protected a small region of north-west Belgium which remained unoccupied. King Albert I, commander-in-chief of the Belgian Army, established his headquarters in Veurne, one of the salient's only towns. The Belgian government, under Charles de Broqueville, established itself in exile in Sainte-Adresse, a suburb of the nearby French city of Le Havre. Aspects =Belgian policy and diplomacy= Despite protecting the northern sector of the Western Front, the Belgian army at the Yser refused to participate in Allied offensives for most of the war. King Albert I, in command of the Belgian armed forces, believed that Belgium's neutrality meant that its army should only be used to further Belgium's national interests. Albert was sceptical of the value of offensive warfare, advocated by the British and French, which he believed to be costly and unable to achieve decisive victory. Albert believed that a mediated peace was inevitable and that it served Belgium's national interest to continue to protect the territory it already held until the Germans could be forced to open negotiations. Consequently, the Yser Front remained generally static for much of the war. Only after the failure of the Ludendorff Offensive in 1918 did the Belgian Army participate in an Allied offensive, the Hundred Days Offensive, making successful advances into German-occupied Belgium. On 28 September 1918, in the Fifth Battle of Ypres, the Groupe d'Arm√©es des Flandres (\\"Flanders Army Group\\" or GAF), under the command of Albert I with the French General Jean Degoutte as Chief of Staff, composed of 12 Belgian divisions, 10 British divisions of the Second Army and 6 French divisions of the Sixth Army attacked the Germans and advanced up to . After the following Battle of Courtrai, the GAF advanced some more. =Daily life= A Belgian soldier on the Yser Front in 1918 The front was held uniquely by Belgian forces, which numbered around 221,000 men by September 1918. Throughout the war, the Belgian Army was supplemented by escapees of military age (√©vad√©s) from German-occupied Belgium. Altogether, around 20,000 Belgian soldiers died on the Yser during the war. In 1914, the Christmas truce was observed in a number of parts of the line and a few Belgian and German troops met in no-man's land between the trenches. Life on the front line was poor, with soldiers forced to live and sleep in unsanitary trenches, in mud ploughed up by artillery fire. Typhus was a major problem among Belgian troops on the Yser Front, where up to 7,000 soldiers died from diseases contracted there. =Politics and the Flemish Movement= Within the Belgian army, the experience of the Yser Front had led to political upheaval. Of the Belgian soldiers on the Yser, between 65 and 80 percent were Flemish, speaking Dutch, while many of the Walloons spoke dialects such as Gaumais or Walloon. The language of command, however, was French and many Flemish soldiers felt resentful at their treatment by the French-speaking officer class. For the Flemish troops, the disquiet culminated in 1916 with the establishment of the Frontbeweging (\\"Front Movement\\") which gained a membership of 5,000 soldiers. Although part of the Flemish Movement, the Frontbeweging called for greater regional autonomy in Belgium, rather than Flemish independence, and the creation of Dutch-speaking regiments. Its most celebrated work was the Open Letter to the Belgian King Albert I, drafted by Adiel Debeuckelaere, in 1917 which aired many of the movement's grievances. Although the Frontbeweging was unsuccessful in the short term, it succeeded in creating a dedicated political party, the Frontpartij, in post-war Belgium after the German defeat delegitimized many other parts of the Flemish Movement implicated in collaboration with the occupation authorities.

The 5 km long beach is part of a stony coastline with fairly deep water close to the shore, spanning the 50 km long eastern shore of the peninsula, Djursland, and situated by the Kattegat sea. This stony coast starts at The Cliffs of Gjerrild to the north on Djursland, and ends 50 km to the south on Mols at the southern tip of the peninsula.  Accessibility  The road Glatved Strandvej, is the only public access road to the southern end of this rarely visited fishermans-, scuba divers- and nature-seekers coast, between the forest of Katholm Skov and the sea of Kattegat. Katholm Skov is a fairly secluded wood, along Glatved beach on the central eastern coast of Djursland. Mostly for locals familiar with the geography, there is one other accessway, making it possible to get to the northern part of Glatved Beach, via the village, √Ölsrode, and the road, Skovlystvej. Limestone quarries whitewashing The southern part of Glatved Beach is dominated by a man made plain, originating from limestone extraction going back at least 150 years.Djurslands Kalk, B√∏rge Kj√¶r The plain consists of now fairly levelled out heaps of stones, that up until the fifties where dumped from rail-wagons coming from an industrial lime kiln at the southern end of the beach, after the lime-stones had been sorted out. The kiln was placed at the end of Katholm Strandvej. In the sea out from Glatved Beach, are the remains of a 65-million-year-old cold water coral reef, consisting of a limestone formation with layers of flint. This reef is the source of the stony coast of Glatved, and the hills behind. This underground lime-formation stretches throughout the Danish underground, and is also exposed at The Cliffs of M√∏n (M√∏ns Klint) on the south-eastern island of Denmark, M√∏n. Here there are coastal cliffs similar to the Cliffs of Dover in England. The formation also surfaces as The Cliffs of Sangstrup, Sangstrup Clint, 20 km north of Glatved Beach in the middle of Denmark, and again in the northern part of the country south of the town, Aalborg. Here the lime is extracted as an ingredient for cement production. The industrial lime kiln at Glatved Strandvej was torn down around year 2000. At the furnace here, limestone was burned and converted into calcium oxide, burnt lime, which in the form of slaked lime was used for mortar production and for white washing of buildings - a widespread surface treatment for masonry in the past, seen on traditional white washed Danish country Churhes, and on many old and white washed farms and houses in the Danish countryside. Today only gravel and stones are extracted from the hills behind Glatved Beach. At the end of Glatved Strandvej is a pier for embarkment of this raw material. Angling Glatved Beach is a good spot for catching garfish, as they migrate through Kattegat from The North Sea to the Baltic Sea in late spring to spawn, and back again in autumn. Offshore kelp forests at Glatved Beach, forms the basis of an abundant marine life. Glatved Beach is an angling and scuba diving area. It gets deep fast enough, for fishing close to the shore.http://www.lystfisker.dk Facing the sea of Kattegat, the coast has some current and good water exchange enabling oxygen-rich conditions. The tidal difference is moderate in the scale of 15 ‚Äì 30 cm. The bottom is mostly stony, as a habitat for marine life and a hold for seaweed, promoting fish life. There are spots with sand in between, giving living conditions for flatfish. Flounder and dab are common flatfish at Glatved Beach. Until the seventies, there was an abundance of cod, but today (2014) cod has become a rare species from all the shores of Djursland. A marked and abrupt change in fish zoology. Garfish, sea trout and mackerel are more abundant now than previously.  Gallery  Glatved Strand kysterrosion v. helligkilde.JPGCoastal erosion at Glatved Beach by Helligkilde.

Freeman Cruisers‚Ñ¢ was a British manufacturer of cabin cruisers that was active between the years of 1957 and 1983. It took its name from its founder, John Freeman. Freeman had been previously manufacturing caravans and towing trailers before Second World War broke out, but production ceased due to the war. In 1983, the assets of the company were sold to Sheridan Marine, which still produces spare parts and sells used boats from their boatyard in Moulsford, Oxfordshire. Over 28 models of boat were produced by the company, and they are frequently seen on the navigable waterways of the UK. In addition, Freeman Cruisers are easily able to go to sea, with a few slight modifications to their plumbing and flushing systems. The boats were constructed from high-quality materials including a fiberglass outer shell with gelcoat, and mahogany interior partitions. Some models were also equipped with flushing toilets and aft cabins. The first Freeman model to be produced was the 22 Mk. 1. Most of the original series of models are modeled after the 22 Mk. 2, which has a distinctive step on its side decks.  Boat Nomenclature  Generally, the boat's model number corresponds to the boat's completed length in feet. A Freeman 23 is 23 feet long, for example. However, for a full list of models available, including their variations, visit the official Freeman Cruiser website.

Then, during the early Han dynasty, a branch of this clan was said to have migrated to Mount Ji () in Qiao Commandery (, within modern Bozhou in Anhui). They then altered the character of their surname to match their new home. Later adoption During the Xianbei Northern Wei dynasty, Emperor Xiaowen implemented a drastic policy of sinicization, ordering his own people to adopt Chinese surnames. The Tongji () tribe of the Xianbei adopted Ji as their surname.

The design was later discarded by the government, after the prototypes were built and tested. The project ended up being too expensive and a poor design. The thin armor, bulky hull and small main gun put the crew in great danger, which made the tank unsuitable for use in combat. History The Soviet T-46, began as an improvement to the T-26. The T46 served the same purpose as the T26, but it was quite different. It was a fast and lightly armored tank. It could reach speeds of up to 50 km/h with relative ease. The T-26 suspension consisted of eight small road wheels carried in pairs on small bogies. The bogies were supported in pairs by leaf springs. This was a much less effective system than the Christie suspension, which had a more advanced, yet more expensive system to maintain and produce. This is the reason why the OKMO team at Zavod No.185 was ordered by the Government of Soviet Union to produce an improved version of the fast light-tank, T-26. Yet the design of the T-46 has proved being too expensive, compared to the final performance of the vehicle to mass-produce. The thin armor, small main armament and the bulky, big design of tank, made the government of Soviet Union cancel the project, and rather create the T-26S and later T-46S, as the improved, mass- production capable tanks. Yet some legacy left over by the T-46S, a later improved version of the T-46 lived on to see the battles in Finland.

It was founded in 2005 by Carlos Avenda√±o Calvo mostly by dissidents of Costa Rica's historical Christian party, Costa Rican Renewal, after its then only deputy, Carlos Avenda√±o Calvo, left. Avenda√±o would successfully return to Congress because of the party from 2010 to 2014. Even though he had personal differences with Justo Orozco (then the PRC's only deputy), both were able to work together in defending the same agenda, mainly the conservative views of the evangelical community. The party's candidate in the presidential election of 2014 was Avenda√±o, who received 1.35 percent of the vote.Resultados Electorales: Total General Tribunal Supremo de Elecciones. 2014-02-17.

In the 2018 Costa Rican general elections the party when it won 14 of the parliament seats and its presidential candidate, Fabricio Alvarado, went in to the runoff.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin- america-42938510 According to the BBC, his campaign gained in popularity because of his opposition to same-sex marriage. The party also holds anti- immigration positions and calls for closed borders and harsher controls on migrants. Controversies In March 2018, the newspaper Semanario Universidad reported that high figures of the party had billed several million colones for professional services for participating in their own campaign such as the beneficiaries' own candidate, Fabricio Alvarado, his wife, his brothers, his two vice-presidential nominees, two sons, and the ex-wife of the party president, Carlos Avenda√±o. It was later discovered that one of the beneficiaries, the son of Avenda√±o, had received professional services for working for the party while he was incapacitated by health from his official work at the Costa Rican Institute of Electricity. In May 2018, it was reported that the party had hired the polling company OPol, according to financial reports submitted to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. Although party officials originally reported that they were political consultancies unrelated to the polls, subsequent investigations by the newspaper La Naci√≥n discovered a contract for the payment of the six surveys that were conducted during the second round campaign, five of which were published and all of which Alvarado appeared as frontrunner by a large margin. Previously, the pollster had already been in controversy after it was reported on social networks that a company vehicle driven by director Mauricio Mu√±oz, had carried party flags. In late May, Avenda√±o himself filed a complaint with the Supreme Electoral Tribunal for what he called a \\"parallel structure\\" made up of the campaign team of the candidate for hiring outside the ethical controls stipulated by the party that would have been the one that negotiated those and other payments.

It is run by Wiltshire Creative, a charity which provides opportunities for members of the community to experience the arts. The centre stages a range of educational and community events, many of them free, and it also participates at events in and around the city, including the Larmer Tree Festival. The centre is housed in the deconsecrated St Edmund's Church on Bedwin Street in central Salisbury. Its main performance space can hold 164 people seated or 400 standing. It also has a studio space called the White Room that seats 60, a media space, a multi- purpose arts and crafts space, a pottery studio, an exhibition space, a caf√©, a bar, and staff offices.  History  In July 1974, the Salisbury Festival of the Arts (now Salisbury International Arts Festival) was held in the building with a programme of classical music and an exhibition of batik paintings. The festival programme asked visitors to suggest ideas for the use of the building, and in 1975 the church's committee agreed to grant use as an arts venue. St Edmunds Arts Trust was established and a group of volunteers coordinated exhibitions from local artists, and workshops for various crafts. The Arts Centre continued to develop in the next decades. Between 1979 and 1981, Sir Henry Moore loaned his Reclining Figure (Time Life 1953) to the Centre, where it was positioned outside the main entrance. By the 1990s the Arts Centre was threatened with closure due to funding cuts but supporters from the community soon launched a \\"Save Our Arts Centre\\" campaign. A new funding plan was accepted and the Arts Centre carried on. By 2003 the Arts Centre had raised funds for a refurbishment project. The ¬£4.2m capital re- development improved the heating, added new level flooring, created various spaces within the main building, improved the toilets, installed new technical equipment, and added an extension. Salisbury Arts Centre reopened in 2005 with a new programme of events. In 2018 the Arts Centre merged with Salisbury Playhouse and Salisbury International Arts Festival to form Wiltshire Creative. St Edmunds Arts Trust was amalgamated with the Playhouse's charity, which was also renamed to Wiltshire Creative.  Notable activities  Salisbury Arts Centre regularly programmes disability events and works in collaboration with disability arts organisations. It works with various community groups and provides free events, including the annual Family Fiesta and the regular Live Lunches. The Arts Centre supports a number of resident artists, including ceramicist Mirka Golden-Hann, who studies colour and glaze technology. Its gallery also mounts a variety of exhibitions.\\"Salisbury Arts Centre houses crochet coral reef display\\". BBC Wiltshire.

Media Hubbub, 17 Feb 2011 and other cultural events. A number of entertainers have performed at Salisbury Arts Centre early in their careers; for example the Manic Street Preachers played in November 1990. In 2015 the Centre was in the news after local residents protested the sudden removal of all municipal funding.  St Edmund's Church  A collegiate church on this site was founded in 1269 by Bishop de la Wyle and dedicated to Saint Edmund of Abingdon, the former Archbishop of Canterbury who had been canonised in 1246. At first there were to be a provost and thirteen priests, but the income of the college (some coming from charter fairs) was not adequate to support that number; the full complement was in place in the middle of the next century, after the grant of income from Whiteparish, Winterbourne Earls and Winterborne St Martin. In the 15th century the college was again in financial difficulty, and like others it was surrendered to Henry VIII in the 1540s. The 13th-century church was rebuilt in the early 15th century, cruciform in plan with a central tower. In 1653 the tower collapsed, severely damaging the nave to its west. The tower was rebuilt, the nave demolished and the 15th-century chancel converted to a nave. A small chancel was added at the east end in the 1840s, and restoration in 1865‚Äì67 by Sir George Gilbert Scott included enlargement of the chancel. The church was designated as Grade II* listed in 1952. After it was declared redundant in 1974 it was converted for use by the Arts Centre in 1975. In 2005, buildings containing offices and workshops were added to the north.

As well as a solo recording project, Rooney became a live band in time to record a Peel session in 1999, but the project ended after a third album was released in 2000.

In 1772 these lands became a part of the Russian Empire. As of 1897, Poloshkovo‚Äôs population was 513, there were 50 houses and a smithy. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 Poloshkovo was successively a part of the Soviet Russia (1917‚Äì1918), the Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia (1919), the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (1919‚Äì1924), the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (since March 1924). In 1931 during the forced collectivization campaign 28 peasant families organized the collective farm. Also in 1930's some of Poloshkovo‚Äôs natives (for example, orthodox priests) were subjected to repressions. During World War II the village was occupied by German troops from August 1941 to September 1943 and suffered greatly, a lot of wooden houses burnt in fire. Poloshkovo was liberated by the Red Army on September 28, 1943. In the second half of the 20th century young people started leaving the village for the towns and the cities.

He was the Regius Professor of Practical Astronomy at Glasgow University from 1784 to 1799. In 1783 he was one of the several joint founders of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. Life He was born on 16 January 1743, the son of Alexander Wilson, who preceded him as Regius Professor of Practical Astronomy at Glasgow University. Patrick was appointed his successor in 1784 before his father quit the role. Probably due to the failing health of his father, they shared the role until his father's death in 1786. He was Clerk of the University Senate from 1783 to 1795 and 1796 to 1799, and was awarded an honorary LLD in 1800. He was the second son of Alexander Wilson, the first Regius Professor of Practical Astronomy at the University. In 1782 he was employed as an assistant to his father, to take care of instruments, make observations, and help with teaching. Patrick Wilson continued his father's type-founding business in Glasgow. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh on 17 November 1783. Also in 1783, Patrick was elected Clerk to the Senate of the University. He was re-elected each year until 1799 with the exception of 1795, when the Senate minutes record that Patrick Cumin was elected in his absence. Wilson was appointed Regius Professor of Practical Astronomy to succeed his father in 1784, but his father retained the post until his death in 1786. At the end of his period in office in 1799, Patrick Wilson bequeathed scientific instruments to the University as well as ¬£1,000, the interest on which was to be used to support his successors in the Chair. He appears to have left Glasgow in 1799 and thereafter lived in London. He died in Kensington Square, London on 30 December 1811.

This was also the case > with Patrick Wilson, the son and successor of Professor Alexander Wilson of > Glasgow. He corresponded with Herschel from 1783; in 1795 he expressed some > regret that his father's name and his views on the constitution of the sun > had not been mentioned in Herschel's paper on the same subject; but > Herschel's reply to this letter seems to have satisfied him perfectly. > Wilson resigned his professorship at Glasgow at the end of 1798, and settled > in London (from 1805 at Windmill Hill, Hampstead), and he and his sister > were on the most cordial terms with Herschel and his wife and sister, and > often paid visits to Slough.

Its founding parties were: *Independent Venetians, led by Luca Azzano Cantarutti; *Veneto State, led by Antonio Guadagnini; *Liga Veneta Repubblica, led by Fabrizio Comencini; *Popular Future, led by Stefano Valdegamberi. =We Independent Veneto= In July 2014 the coalition gave birth to We Independent Veneto (Noi Veneto Indipendente), as a joint list for the 2015 regional election: *Independent Venetians, led by Luca Azzano Cantarutti; *Veneto State, led by Antonio Guadagnini; *Liga Veneta Repubblica, led by Fabrizio Comencini; *Chiavegato for Independence, led by Lucio Chiavegato; *North-East Project, led by Mariangelo Foggiato; *Tea Party Veneto, led by Carlo Sandrin and Michele Varini; *Pro Veneto, led by Roberto Agirmo. =2015 regional election= After the exit of Chiavegato and his group from the alliance and their alignment with Alessio Morosin's Venetian Independence, the remaining six parties of NVI formed a joint list for the 2015 regional election named Independence We Veneto with Zaia, a sort of re-edition of 2010's North-East Union, but with a separatist platform and in support of Luca Zaia, incumbent President of Veneto and candidate of Liga Veneta‚ÄìLega Nord. In the election, the list won 2.7% of the vote (0.2pp more than Venetian Independence) and Antonio Guadagnini of Veneto State was elected regional councillor in the provincial constituency of Vicenza. Soon after being installed, Guadagnini, who was elected Vice President of the Regional Council of Veneto, formed a pro-independence \\"inter- group\\", which was joined from the start by Stefano Valdegamberi, re-elected councillor in Zaia's personal list, and Massimiliano Barison of Forza Italia. =Recent events= In March 2016, Guadagnini severed his ties with INV and changed his affiliation in the Council to We Are Veneto, causing a strong reaction by INV leaders. In May 2017, the party was a founding member of Great North (GN), a liberal and federalist party. This alignment would be short- lived: in November 2017 INV broke with GN, after the latter had welcomed Veneto First and former members of Veneto State, without consulting and/or engaging INV. Moreover, INV criticised GN's anti-Lega Nord stance: while differing from that party on several issues, INV wanted to continue to cooperate with it. In the 2017 local elections, the party fielded lists only in a few places, including Belluno (3.8% under the \\"Bellunese Civilisation\\" banner) and Marcon (3.0%). After having officially presented its symbol for the 2018 general election, INV chose not to participate.

The robot puts dominoes next to each other before Kyary topples them and pretends like nothing happened. The robot argues with the referee that it was not his fault but the referee does not allow it.

It follows the life of June Elbus, a 14-year-old girl, whose gay uncle had died of AIDS in the 1980s, and the subsequent friendship she develops with his boyfriend. Throughout this friendship June finds comfort in knowing that her uncle, a man who inspired the love of so many, is mourned not only by the family and his partner but by the art community. The novel chronicles June's journey as she mourns her uncle Finn's death amid the 1980s AIDS epidemic, a time when the disease was relatively unknown. Despite the association between Uncle Finn's lifestyle and the disease, June accepts to meet the partner he left behind, ultimately accepting the death of her uncle and finding herself in the process. Plot June Elbus is a 14-year-old girl living in Westchester in 1986. She is in love with her gay uncle, Finn Weiss, a fact she is scared to admit even to herself. Finn is dying of AIDS. Being a professional painter, he asks June and her elder sister Greta to sit for a portrait, which he completes a few days before his death. At his funeral, June notices a stranger hanging around. She learns that he is Finn's boyfriend, Toby. She is warned against him by her family, particularly her mother, who forbids June from having any contact with him. One day Toby delivers a message to June, asking her to meet him at a train station nearby. Although initially hesitant, she decides to meet him. They ride to Finn's apartment, where Toby now lives alone. He gives her some of Finn's possessions, which he left behind for her. One of these include a book with a message to June from Finn, asking her to take care of Toby, as he had nobody else. Meanwhile, the media comes to know of the portrait, which Finn named \\"Tell the Wolves I'm Home\\". Recognizing its monetary value, June's mother moves it to a bank vault and gives the keys to June and Greta. June visits it often, and notices there are additions to the painting: black buttons on her shirt and a skull behind Greta's hand, which she realizes is drawn by Greta herself. June too paints on the portrait, adding streaks of golden to their hair. Over the months, Toby and June meet frequently, and the two become close. She realizes that much of what she has heard from her mother about Toby is false and comes from her mother's resentment of Finn. They were very close during their childhood but ever since leaving home, their lives had become very different: while she became a suburban accountant, he became a globetrotting artist, which she always aspired to be. June reveals Finn's message to Toby, who in turn says that he received a similar one, asking him to take care of June. He also tells her that he painted the buttons on the portrait moments after Finn's death, to grant his dying wish to see \\"more detail\\" in it. Meanwhile, at home, Greta and June find it hard to get along. Greta comes to know of her meetings with Toby and taunts her for it, straining the sisters' already damaged relationship. Greta plays Bloody Mary in their school's presentation of South Pacific. Impressed by Greta's performance, her drama teacher suggests she act in Broadway, a prospect she is not too keen on. However, she is pressured by her mother to take a shot at it. Troubled, Greta takes to excessive drinking and smoking. She often lies drunk in the woods near her school, where June is forced to rescue her from more than once. On the day of her show, Greta asks June to meet her in the woods after the play. The same day, June and her mother visit the bank vault, where her mother is shocked to see the additions to the painting. June takes full responsibility for it, and is grounded. During the show, June realizes that Greta is drunk. Since she cannot meet her in the woods because of being grounded, she calls Toby and asks him to bring Greta home. That night two policemen visit their house, bringing Greta along with them. They tell the Elbuses that they arrested her, along with Toby, on seeing him carry her from the woods. June's mother recognizes Toby. Greta lies that she befriended Toby and invited him to the after-show party because she felt sorry for him. The policemen leave, taking Toby along with them. That night, Greta tells June that she was jealous of Finn for being more important to June than she was, which was why Greta grew distant from her. On Finn's death, she thought things would be like they were when the two of them were younger, but by then June was occupied with Toby. June realizes that Greta, like Toby, has nobody, and the two reconcile. For days after his arrest, June is unable to contact Toby. She finally finds that he was admitted to a hospital due to his rapidly deteriorating health. She goes there to find him very weak. As they talk, June finally admits to Toby that Finn was her first love. She also realizes that Toby is her second. She takes him to her house, telling her parents everything about him. June hears her mother apologize to Toby. With the two of them in the room, Toby dies. That night, June sees her mother paint a necklace on June's neck and a ring to Greta's hand in the portrait. The next day, an art inspector tells them that the portrait can be restored to its original form to undo the damage. When it is returned to the Elbuses, June notices that although Toby's, Greta's and her additions were removed, her mother's necklace and ring have been left untouched.  Symbols  * Crocodile - This was the nickname that Finn created for June because of the way in which she seemed as if she was from another time. June had an obsession with the medieval times but the nickname may have been created due to the way in which she quietly handled herself, forming her own unique opinions about things instead of conforming to the opinion of others. * South Pacific - Throughout the novel Greta was taking part in the school's production of South Pacific, playing the role of Bloody Mary. The musical itself centers around the lives of multiple of different individuals who are engaging in activities that they feared would cause them to be prejudiced again. Similar to the way in which Finn and Toby's relationship was prejudiced against within the novel, the couples in South Pacific struggle against the controversy that surrounds race. * Middle Ages- June was extremely interested in the time period of the middle ages, and interest that Finn always supported by taking her to renaissance/medieval fairs. June appreciated this time for its simplicity, something that completely juxtaposed her life after Finn's death. * Tell the Wolves I'm Home- This is the title that Finn gave to his portrait of June and Greta. Throughout the novel one of June's favorite places was the woods located near her school. She would wander around listening for the howls of the wolves that inhabit it feeling as though she were at home, in a happy place. June and Greta's relationship had become distant as they grew up, by titling his portrait like this Finn may have been sending a message to June about the importance of establishing stronger relationships with family.  1980s AIDS crisis in the United States  Throughout the novel, the protagonist, June Elbus must face her uncle Finn's death at the hands of a \\"mysterious illness\\". Originally wanting to shield June from the truth about Finn's lifestyle and death, her family does not mention the partner he left behind until he appears briefly at his funeral service. \\"He's the guy who killed Uncle Finn\\" is the way in which Greta singles out Toby at the funeral parlor, a moment that illustrates the way in which the Elbus family and the general public at the time viewed gay men and a disease that seemed to only affect them. Also known as the \\"gay plague\\" AIDS in the 1980s was a disease relatively unknown throughout the world and especially in the United States. The gay community, pre-AIDS, was considered to be a group of individuals constantly engaging in inappropriate sexual behavior, something that already created a negative connotation surrounding gay individuals. June Elbus lived in a time when people were more open about their sexuality, but still prejudiced against for having different sexual preferences than what was considered the heterosexual norm. On June 5, 1981, MMWR (Mobility and Morality Weekly Report) published the cases of five, previously healthy, gay men who had died of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), these were the first case in the United States of what would be known as AIDS. Although the number of deaths increased rapidly the government did not seem to consider the epidemic a priority. White House officials would answer few questions on the subject and in the off chance that they did would respond to the disease as something that the gay community may deserve for engaging in a lifestyle not agreed upon by many. Throughout the novel it seemed, especially during the final days of Finn's life, that the family blamed his sexual orientation for his declining health and ultimately his death. These opinions within the family made it extremely difficult for June to agree to meeting Toby, since the relationship he had with her uncle was the cause of his death. Throughout their friendship, however, June realized that Toby and her Uncle's relationship was nothing like the way in which gay men were depicted during the time. The way in which Toby was accepted not only by June but also by Greta before his death represented the way in which the gay community would finally achieve (after protests and a constant fight for equal rights) the governments cooperation in funding research to find a cure for the epidemic. Writing Brunt says the inspiration for Tell The Wolves I'm Home came from an idea of \\"a dying uncle painting a final portrait of his niece\\". It started out as a short story, which she began expanding after receiving a grant from the Arts Council of England. While Brunt shares some similarities with the novel's protagonist, she has stressed that the story itself is not autobiographical. Publishers Weekly noted that Tell the Wolves I'm Home \\"has young adult‚Äìnovel qualities, with moral conflicts that resolve themselves too easily and characters nursing hearts of gold.\\" Brunt herself recognized this, stating in an interview that \\"When I first started writing it, I thought it could end up as either YA or adult\\", but ultimately felt it was an adult book.  Awards  Tell The Wolves I'm Home was presented the Alex Award in 2013 by the Young Adult Library Services Association (YALSA). This award is given to books written for adults that appeal to adolescent readers (aged 12‚Äì18). Reception Tell The Wolves I'm Home was received positively by critics. Sam Sacks of The Wall Street Journal called it a \\"tremendously moving debut novel [that imbues] June with the disarming candor of a child and the melancholy wisdom of a heart-scarred adult.\\" Writing for Paste, Carla Jean Whitley gave it an 8 out of a possible 10, calling it an \\"immensely satisfying tale ... offer[ing] insight into the complicated web of human emotions.\\" Samantha Nelson of The A.V. Club graded it an A- and said the book \\"provides an earnest look at the burdens of choice and the fear of missed opportunities\\", but disliked the change in narratives from present-day June to future June. The novel was named one of the best books of the year by The Wall Street Journal, O: The Oprah Magazine, Kirkus, BookPage and Amazon. Brunt's debut novel was also chosen as a Barnes and Nobles Discover Pick, Target Club Pick, and Costco Pennies Pick. The novel has so far been translated into 18 languages, and is currently a New York Times Best Seller (#18).

Rocha publicly spoke out against Proposition 187, a 1994 ballot measure intended to restrict undocumented immigrants from access to California's public education system. Career Rocha taught for a year in Caracas, Venezuela at the Universidad Simon Bolivar. Rocha became dean of the College of Arts and Humanities at Humboldt State University in 1996. He was previously a professor and associate dean of Cal State Northridge's School of Humanities. Two years later, in 1998, Rocha became provost of Seton Hall University. He left Seton Hall for Santiago Canyon College, where he was the college president for the 2000-2001 school year.

He replaced Lisa Sugimoto, who was the interim president following the resignation of Paulette Perfumo. In 2012, the Pasadena Area Community College District (PACCD) Board of Trustees extended Rocha's contract as PCC's Superintendent-President through the end of the 2016 academic year. In March 2013, an ad-hoc faculty committee and the Associated Students of PCC placed votes of \\"no confidence\\" in Rocha. The faculty committee vote showed 92% displeasure with his management of the college. In April 2013, the Academic Senate voted against him 23‚Äì0, with one abstention. The votes followed Rocha's defense of the PACCD Board of Trustees' approval of a 2013-2014 academic calendar without a winter session. The PACCD Board of Trustees offered a statement supporting Rocha following the votes of \\"no confidence\\" and extended his contract until 2017. When the PACCD Board of Trustees removed faculty and staff input on his performance evaluation, in March 2014 the Academic Senate conducted its own evaluation, using the existing college evaluation forms. The majority of respondents answered \\"nothing\\" was working at the college, and frequently suggested that Rocha's departure would improve the college.http://www.pasadenaweekly.com/cms/story/detail/big_apple_bound/13225/ Rocha announced his retirement from Pasadena City College in August 2014, following a failed attempt to take on the presidency of Kingsborough Community College in New York. He said that it was \\"time for me to spend more time with my family and return to my passion for teaching and writing\\". Although the PCC Board of Trustees initially denied the fact, Rocha was paid over $403,000 plus legal fees for his salary through to early 2016, but the settlement given to him by the PCC Board of Trustees was overturned on April 29, 2015 by LA Superior Court Judge Joanne O‚ÄôDonnell, ruling on the lawsuit filed in August 2014 by Californians Aware. The settlement had been decided in a closed session, in violation of open meeting Brown Act laws. Rocha, who had threatened to sue the board regarding negative comments made about him, was required to return the $403,000 and renegotiate the settlement agreement. In May 2015, Rocha was one of four finalists to become Chancellor of North Orange County Community College District but his name was withdrawn from consideration. Rocha spent three years working for the Governor's Office of Storm Recovery, a New York state government effort focused on restoration of residences damaged in major storms. He became the chancellor of City College of San Francisco in July 2017. In June 2019, Rocha worked with college and city leaders to secure long-term funding for the Free City program, which offers free tuition for San Francisco residents, but the college remained in a difficult financial situation. In March 2020, the college announced that Rocha had been placed on administrative leave for undisclosed reasons. Soon after that announcement, he resigned as part of a confidential agreement in which he was paid $340,000 and given a year of free health coverage.

Most of her work was published under the name of Mrs Edward Kennard. Kennard specialised in stories of the English country house world of hunting, shooting, and fishing, and in her heyday was dubbed \\"the Diana of fiction\\", in honour of Diana, the Roman goddess of hunting.Andrew Maunder, Mary Kennard at valancourtbooks.com, accessed 5 March 2014 Life Mary Eliza was born in Sydenham in 1850, the eldest daughter of Samuel and Mary Laing. Samuel Laing was chairman of the Brighton Railway. As Mary has been wrongly recorded as the daughter of Charles Wilson Faber.Virginia Blain, Patricia Clements, Isobel Grundy, The Feminist Companion to Literature in English (1990), p. 606: \\"Kennard, Mary Eliza (Faber), 'Mrs Edward Kennard', d. 1936, sporting novelist, da. of Mary (Beckett) and Charles Wilson F.

The error probably arose because in that period and earlier a 'sister-in-law' was often referred to as simply a 'sister', and Mary Eliza's sister Theresa was married to Walter Vavasour Faber, one of Charles Wilson Faber's sons. Mary Eliza's parentage and early life are described in a brief contemporary biography, which quotes her as saying \\"I fancy that any small love of literature which I may possess is hereditary, since my father, who is now chairman of the Brighton Railway, has written several important books, notably 'Modern Science and Modern Thought', 'Problems of the Future' etc., whilst my grandfather, Mr S.

The film stars Cuba Gooding Jr., Dennis Haysbert, and LisaGay Hamilton. Plot The film tells the true story of Eugene Brown (Cuba Gooding Jr.), an ex- convict who starts the Big Chair Chess Club for inner-city youths in Washington, D.C.. Eugene is in prison where \\"Chess Man\\" gambles cigarettes with him over chess games. When Eugene is ready to be released he confides that he is concerned about not having many friends on the outside any more. He receives a wooden king chess piece from Chess Man and is told \\"Take care of the King, everything else follows\\". On the outside Eugene looks for work and has trouble finding it due to his ex-con status. He attempts to reconnect with his daughter Katrina (Trini) who rebuffs his attempts but informs him that his son Marco is in Juvenile Hall for selling drugs. His friend Billy connects him with a job at a local high school working as a janitor. Eugene gets a visit from his former lieutenant Perry who is now prosperous and the man in charge. The lure to return to his former ways is strong. At the local high school, the students are unruly and dealing drugs in detention and scare off the detention monitor. The principal Sheila King asks Eugene to fill in as detention monitor for a few minutes. He proves to be unexpectedly persuasive at getting the students to sit down and follow the rules. He is allowed to return as the detention monitor until a replacement can be found. Eugene bets on a game of cards with a student and wins, the prize being that the students will learn to play chess. Two of the students Tahime Sanders and Clifton are dealing drugs and contemplating armed robbery. Eugene draws a parallel comparing Clifton to a pawn working for a king he calls refers to as \\"King Perry\\". Clifton tells Perry that Eugene is running detention and preventing the sell of weed there, leading to reduced profits for Perry. Tahime proves to be an excellent strategist on the Chess board. Tahime invites another student (Peanut) in on the crimes they are engaged in. The principal receives an anonymous tip (from Perry) that Eugene is an ex-con and she is forced to fire him. Eugene visits Perry who offers him cash. Mean Gene does not accept the money and walks away. Eugene attempts to restart the chess club by driving to the local hang out joint for the teenagers, but they refuse to play outside of detention. Peanut changes his mind and goes with Eugene who makes him president of the chess club by giving him the wooden king piece. Eugene rents a run down house in Washington D.C. for the chess club. Clifton and Tahime come to the chess house to get Peanut and take him to rip off some dealers. Peanut is shot and killed in the course of the robbery. While Eugene goes to comfort Tahime the chess house is vandalized. Tahime refuses to stay involved with Clifton. He comes back to the Chess house and returns the wooden king piece he got from Peanut's body. The chess team regroups and restores the house and begins advertising via flyers around town and around the school. Eugene convinces Tahime to compete in a chess tournament, but Tahime's mother refuses to sign the consent form. He forges her signature and enters the contest. Tahime wins the tournament, however, the officials disqualify the team due to the forged signature and the lack of birth certificates for the students (despite Eugene saying some of the students don't have birth certificates \\"where we come from\\"). A local radio producer invites Eugene and Tahime to come on the air and present their argument. Eugene presents his view that they didn't win, because they didn't play by the rules, and that is crucial in his view (learning the rules and winning within them). Tahime is angered by this line of reasoning and storms off. While looking for Tahime, Eugene fails to accompany his daughter to get his son Marco, which leads to anger between them. Tahime returns and wants to play in the Washington D.C. chess open tournament. He begins to study chess from a book and practice relentlessly. Clifton is arrested and calls Perry from Prison, but is hung up on (illustrating his role as a pawn). Tahime advances to the final match and faces one of the best players in the country, J. Thomas Gaines. Tahime puts up a good fight but ultimately loses. Nonetheless, Tahime gets a standing ovation from his supporters in the crowd. A representative of the Urban League gives her card to Eugene, saying she wishes to help him go to college. Gaines tells Tahime that \\"that was the first time I've been scared all year.\\" The film ends with the Eugene's children visiting the chess house.

The machines form part of the material handling equipment industry that, amongst others, also covers fork lift trucks, overhead cranes and pallet jacks. Although ‚Äòelectric tug‚Äô is perhaps the most commonly used term, suppliers and customers regularly use a range of other names that include towing tractors, battery-powered tugs, electric hand trucks, electric tuggers and pedestrian operated tugs. The tugs move loads across a single level. They do not lift the load clear of the ground which is why the load must be on wheels. If the load itself does not have wheels, it would be placed on a wheeled platform often referred to as a trolley, bogie or skate. The tug connects to this wheeled platform just as a fork lift truck links to a pallet in order to move a load sat on it. In most cases a steel coupling (male) attached to the machine itself connects to a corresponding coupling (female) bolted to the load's bogie. A second bogie or multiple bogies will each have identical female couplings attached to them so that a single male coupling attached to the machine can move them all without alterations. Operation Electric tug moving a heavy cable drum An electric tug relies on the principal of tractive effort. The machine, once secured to the bogie, will lift a portion of the load ensuring the load's wheels remain on the ground. This is achieved via the machine's hydraulic mast which is designed to create downforce on the drive wheel immediately beneath it. It is the traction generated from this process that allows the tug to move very large and heavy objects. As a tug does not lift its load clear of the ground it does not have to conform to the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998 (LOLER), therefore an operator does not need a licence to operate it. Applications Electric tugs are used in many industry sectors. Some common applications include; *Retail - To move heavy roll cages from a delivery vehicle's tail lift to the supermarket's storeroom or long trains of empty roll cages. *Healthcare ‚Äì to move bariatric beds, waste bins (including multiple bins at once), linen cages and gas bottles. *Pharmaceutical ‚Äì to move chromatography columns within laboratories. *Supermarkets and Airports ‚Äì to move long trains of empty luggage trolleys. *Horticulture and Agriculture ‚Äì to move heavy materials such as top soil or to harvest crops in polytunnels. *Construction ‚Äì to move heavy building materials or to access construction sites where diggers and movers cannot due to size restrictions. *Food and beverage ‚Äì to move industrial mixing bowls full of product. *Waste handling - to move containers and waste bins and wheelie bins. *Manufacturing and Assembly- :*Automotive - To move heavy products such as vehicles down a production line. :*Glass ‚Äì To move heavy stillages used to hold glass through production. :*Wind Turbines ‚Äì Moving turbine blades up to 50 metres in length through production. :*Aerospace ‚Äì To move wing assemblies, invar tooling, turnover jigs etc. :*Boat building ‚Äì To move luxury yachts on cradles through production. :*Brick and ceramic ‚Äì To move product into and out of a kiln. Electric tug in ceramic industry :*Modular buildings ‚Äì To move buildings through production and completed buildings into storage. :*Cable and wire reels ‚Äì To move unwieldy reels in production. *Rail - To move loads mounted on rails, such as in railway maintenance depots.

From the 18th to the 20th century, the area encompassed by this district was one of the more fashionable and desirable neighborhoods adjacent to the commercial Weymouth Landing area. It also contains remnants of a once-flourishing small scale shoe manufacturing industry. The district includes nearly 150 resources, primarily residential houses, as well as a school, two cemeteries, and a small cluster of commercial buildings. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. The district is focused on the northern stretch of Front Street, extending roughly from Washington Street in the north to Congress Street in the south. It also includes rows of properties along Summer Street from its junction with Front Street to Kingman Street, as well as Franklin and Broad Streets; individual properties lie on other streets immediately adjacent to the included sections of Front and Summer Streets. The geographically largest portions of the district are the Weymouth Village Cemetery (established 1843), at its southeastern corner, Weston Park (established in the 1920s) in its northeast, and the Hunt Street School property (a Colonial Revival public school built 1915-17 that now houses a private Christian academy). The oldest building in the district is a Cape Style house built c. 1720 at 160 Front Street; there are other 18th century Cape and Georgian style homes on Front and Summer Streets. One example of a 19th-century shoemaker's shop that survives is the building at 99 Front Street, now converted to a residence. Smaller shops, which have been converted to garages or other outbuildings, also survive at 131 and 204 Front Street.

It was torn down in 1961 and replaced with a skeleton tower on the same foundation. History The Racine Reef is a major hazard to navigation not only for shipping in and out of Racine harbor, but also for traffic between Milwaukee and Chicago. It has been marked with a succession of aids, starting with a can buoy placed in 1869 after a study of erecting a lighthouse on the reef itself found the expense to be too great. Various shore lights were also added including ranges based on the Racine breakwaters and a red beacon mounted on the Wind Point Light. These measures were found to be ineffective, and in 1898 construction began on a beacon set in the center of the reef. This acetylene- powered lamp was placed on a masonry platform resting on a wood crib; the light was first lit on August 31, 1899. This arrangement proved quickly to be quite problematic; the light was difficult to service and ever-increasing piles of rip-rap were laid about the platform in attempts to curb erosion and storm damage. In 1901 the beacon's iron tower was also made taller, but the problems continued. In 1901 the lighthouse board decided that a manned light was required, and in 1903 obtained a $75,000 appropriation. Construction was protracted: the crib and concrete pier foundation were not completed until 1905. Atop this was erected a three-story octagonal brick house with a tower in the center to hold a fourth order Fresnel lens. The original steam whistle fog signal was replaced with diaphone foghorns in the mid-1920s. The new tower was placed at the eastern edge of the reef, and upon its activation the old beacon was abandoned. The light was automated in 1954, but in 1961 the house was demolished due to the difficulties of maintenance. By that point large amounts of rip-rap had been dumped around the pier in order to reduce vibration from waves and to limit winter icing of the structure. A steel tower replaced the house and remains in service. The Fresnel lens was preserved and is displayed at the Racine Heritage Museum.

He is considered the most prolific serial killer in Turkish history, being responsible for the deaths of 18 people between 1994 and 2002 according to police records, or as many as 40 according to eyewitnesses and his relatives. Early life Yavuz Yapƒ±cƒ±oƒülu was born in Adana in 1967. He has nine siblings. He claimed his family was unloving. His father married a woman with whom he had an affair, and he was raised by his stepmother. He finished primary and middle school at the top of the class. He was well liked by his classmates. He left home and dropped out of high school in the tenth grade after a quarrel with his parents. He married, but the marriage lasted only a brief time. He played football on his school's team and later for an amateur league club. He started a business in the leather trade but was unsuccessful. Sometime before 1994, he joined a religious cult in Merter, Istanbul. Since he had no income, he lived with his brother. Crimes Yapƒ±cƒ±oƒülu committed his crimes apparently with little cause. In 1994, he stabbed three people to death after one of them wished him good morning. The 20-year-old Sait Korkmaz died at the scene. Yapƒ±cƒ±oƒülu then tried to escape, hijacking a car and killing the driver, Rasim Aydƒ±n. Yapƒ±cƒ±oƒülu was apprehended in Avcƒ±lar. He was placed in Bakƒ±rk√∂y Psychiatric Hospital, where he assaulted his roommates and the nurses, and set his ward on fire. He was released due a medical report attesting diminished responsibility. Later he interfered in a dispute between a girl and a servant in Istanbul, running after the girl and stabbing the servant to death when the servant tried to interfere. After the killing, he fled to Adana, where he killed three more people without any known cause. He boarded a coach in Adana, and during a stopover in Ankara, he murdered another man. Yapƒ±cƒ±oƒülu then ran after an eyewitness, caught him and killed him by cutting his throat. From Ankara, Yapƒ±cƒ±oƒülu went to √áorlu, where his brother owned a shop. He set his brother's shop on fire because he did not give him pocket money. He also set the houses of two other relatives on fire. He raided his father's home in Silivri with intent to kill him, but his father defended himself with a pump-action shotgun. He fled from there to Edremit, where his maternal grandmother lived. Three days later, Yapƒ±cƒ±oƒülu killed her by hitting her head with a crystal ashtray, because she had told him something about his mother (her daughter) that he did not like. His mother died of a heart attack two days later, upon learning about this incident. After another arrest, Bakƒ±rk√∂y Psychiatric Hospital again found him to have diminished responsibility. He stayed in a mental hospital for treatment lasting about one year. Following his release, he continued with his murders. He killed three people and injured two more severely with a screwdriver in √áorlu. Late at night, he went first to the √áorluspor facility, and murdered nightman H√ºseyin Yumruk with a screwdriver. Then, he skewered √ñzcan Karag√∂zoƒülu in an industrial zone. Finally, he killed ≈ûakir Tem√ºri√ßi, whom he met on the street. He threw the bodies in a hole. In the early morning hours, he went in Tongu√ßlar Mosque, wounded the imam, Salih Ba≈ü, in his neck with a screwdriver, and escaped. He was apprehended on December 24, 2002, and the court ordered his mental examination by the legal medicine institute, which certified in April 2003 that Yapƒ±cƒ±oƒülu was fully criminally liable for offences he committed. The report stated further that he simulated mental disorder. He was detained in the Tekirdaƒü Prison. During his trial in Tekirdaƒü on December 25, 2002, he admitted that he can normally speak well and do good, but he sometimes experiences loss of feeling time and place. He added that his killings took place during such episodes. Immediately after his arrest, his brother Yƒ±ldƒ±r Yapƒ±cƒ±oƒülu stated in an interview with a newspaper that Yavuz Yapƒ±cƒ±oƒülu is responsible also for the unsolved so-called Avcƒ±lar murders. He added that his brother had assaulted and raped women because he hated women due to his unsuccessful marriage. According to Yƒ±ldƒ±r Yapƒ±cƒ±oƒülu, Yavuz confessed to other killings to him. He said he knew of three more unsolved murders in Istanbul, three in Adana, and two in Ankara, as well as the killing of a soldier. According to his brother, Yavuz Yapƒ±cƒ±oƒülu, who was nicknamed \\"The Screwdriver Killer\\", has killed more than forty people, of whom only 18 were identified. He is believed to be the serial killer with the highest known victim count in Turkey.

CERT (Buy America Certified) stenciled on tracks of the Sonoma‚ÄìMarin Area Rail Transit system, which was partially funded with federal grants Section 165 () of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (commonly called the Buy America Act) is a section of the larger STAA that deals with purchases related to rail or road transportation. Unlike the similarly titled Buy American Act (1933), the Buy America Act applies only to purchases related to rail or road transportation, such as the construction of highways, railways, or rapid transit systems. The 1982 provisions also apply to purchases made by third-party agencies, using funds granted by agencies within the United States Department of Transportation. Transportation infrastructure projects built with iron, steel, and manufactured products must purchase materials in the United States. This applies to mass-transit related procurements valued over $150,000 and funded at least in part by federal grants. This includes highways, bridges, airports and tunnels. Canadian manufacturers, as joint signatories to NAFTA and the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), are often eligible to be considered equivalent to US manufacturers., though NAFTA excluded highway and transit grants from its coverage, and while the GPA agreement obliges the governments of 37 US states to treat Canadian products as equivalent to US products, the GPA also excludes highway and transit grants that are Federally funded. The Buy America rules are occasionally amended by the Federal Transit Administration and the Federal Highway Administration. According to the Associated General Contractors of Washington, elements of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 conflicted with the Buy America provisions of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982, although the legislation specified that the existing Buy America requirements would extend to ARRA-funded highway and transit projects.

Guy Hersey Farm The Guy Hersey Farm, 1088 Franklin Highway, includes of land, a c. 1830 farmhouse, and a number of barns and other outbuildings. Although the house predates the establishment of the farm by Hiram Fellows, physical and documentary evidence suggest it was moved to this site from another location. It began as a 1.5 story wood frame house with a side-gable roof. In the 1850s it was enlarged by raising the roof and adding a south wing. A barn dating to c. 1865-80 is connected to the house by a shed extension, and a second barn (c. 1917) is attached to the first. A third barn, dating to c. 1920 and moved to the site by Guy Hersey from another farm, forms an enclosed barnyard with the other two. The most interesting outbuilding is a c. 1890 structure that was initially used as a piggery, but was converted by Hersey into a smithy. Hersey's property also includes the foundational remnants of an old schoolhouse. The farm that was established by Hiram Fellows was probably operated by his father Nathan on a subsistence basis. After several changes of ownership it was acquired by Hersey, who first had a dairy operation. When this became less economically viable, he used the farm to raise cattle, an operation that continues today. James Hersey Farm The James Hersey farmstead The James Hersey Farm, 1057 Franklin Highway, consists of of land on both sides of the highway, a c. 1874-75 farmhouse, and a number of outbuildings. The house was built by Alfred Weare after his earlier house was destroyed by fire resulting from a lightning strike. An attached barn from the same period, and a modern garage complete the main complex on the north side of the highway. Opposite this complex on the south side of the highway is a second barn and milk house, and there is a small logging camp structure in a wooded area of the property further to the south. James Hersey acquired the property in 1945, and ran it as a dairy farm until 1980. The property was taken over by his son, who raises cattle on the property.

The accepted name therefore dates from Pilsbry who provided the first description and illustrations. Description The size of the shell attains 4 mm, its diameter 4‚Äì6 mm. The small, solid shell has a globose-depressed-conical shape. It is narrowly umbilicate. It is lusterless, soiled whitish or yellowish, with either a series of dark flammules below the sutures. The base of the shell is faintly articulated with dark, or else. The entire surface is mottled andnearly covered with blackish. The body whorl is obtusely subangular, and descends a trifle anteriorly. The sutures are narrowly but decidedly impressed. The penultimate whorl has 7 or 8 equal strong spiral lirae, as wide as the interstices, which are densely obliquely striate and have usually a few indistinct spiral striae. The base has about 10 concentric liruase. The rounded aperture is very oblique, thickened with opaque white within. Its edge is crenulated. The narrow umbilicus is bounded by an indistinctly crenulated rib, strongly grooved within. The upper one or two lirae are more or less beaded, and sometimes all of them are.

Fowey River Academy was reportedly charged at least ¬£300,000 for LED lighting that its chairman of governors said was not installed. History The school dates back to the Fowey Free School which was founded in 1692 by John Rashleigh and Shadrack Vincent. The land was provided by John Treffry and Vincent gave ¬£500 to purchase land to provide income for the school. Originally the school was for \\"educating 30 poor children of Fowey and adjacent places.\\" numbers increased by 25 in 1773 when a further bequest was given John Johns. In 1880 the school was converted to a Board School under the Elementary Education Act 1870 and a new building added in 1876. A new Grammar School, designed by Silvanus Trevail was built in 1879-80 on Daglands Road. In 1922 both school were taken over by the County Council and two charities set up the Fowey Grammar School Site Foundation, which held the land and buildings, and the Fowey Grammar School Exhibition Foundation which provided assistance above that of the local authority. In 1957 a new Secondary Modern School was opened, and the board school became a primary school. In 1970 the Secondary Modern become Fowey Comprehensive School. The original building ceased being used 1989 and were eventually sold in 1997. The school was awarded full community status in June 1990, and in June 1992 received the Schools‚Äô Curriculum Award for enriching the curriculum through links with the community.

Its organizers called for a \\"million-man protest\\" against a proposed law overturning the exemption from military service for Haredi talmudical students and criminalizing those who refused to enlist in the Israel Defense Forces. From 300,000 to 600,000 people gathered in one of the largest protests in Israeli history.  History Aerial view of the demonstration The protest opposed Israeli military and civil conscription of Orthodox yeshiva students, who have been exempted from military conscription or national service since 1977. A petition led to a 1998 high-court ruling that the Minister of Defense Act was not intended to exempt the Orthodox community on such a large scale, and it was decided that the issue required new legislation from the Knesset.◊ë◊í\\"◊• 3267/97 ◊ê◊û◊†◊ï◊ü ◊®◊ï◊ë◊ô◊†◊©◊ò◊ô◊ô◊ü ◊ï◊ê◊ó◊®◊ô◊ù ◊†' ◊©◊® ◊î◊ë◊ô◊ò◊ó◊ï◊ü, ◊†◊ô◊™◊ü ◊ë-9 ◊ë◊ì◊¶◊û◊ë◊® 1998 A public committee, headed by Justice Zvi Tal, was appointed after the 1999 Supreme Court decision.

The ruling, which provided a timeline of five years, was extended an additional five years in 2007. During the summer of 2012, the court ruled that the law was unjust and must expire.http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files/07/980/062/n18/07062980.n18.htm ◊ë◊í\\"◊• 6298/07 ◊®◊°◊ú◊® ◊†' ◊õ◊†◊°◊™ ◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú (February 21, 2012) With its expiration IDF service is mandatory for all members of the Haredi community, with a penalty (imprisonment for up to five years) for those who refuse to enlist. However, the law is not enforced against members of the Haredi community by authority of the Defense Minister. After several unsuccessful attempts to draft a new law (such as the Plesner Committee), the Special Committee for the Equal Sharing of the Burden Bill (also known as the Shaked Committee after its chairwoman, Bayit Yehudi MK Ayelet Shaked) was formed. During its deliberations (ongoing at the time of the protest) the committee proposed a law establishing annual quotas for the drafting of yeshiva students for military or national service and calling for criminal sanctions against draft evaders if the quotas are not met by mid-2017. The bill would mandate a gradual increase in recruitment levels of yeshiva students. Each year 1,800 promising students would be granted exemptions to continue their studies, and yeshiva students beyond draft age would be allowed to enter the workforce.  Preparation  Women praying for an end to conscription On February 24, 2014, the leaders of Agudath Israel, Degel HaTorah and Shas gathered for a conference in Bnei Brak and decided on a demonstration a week after the conference. All haredi boys and men over age nine were summoned to attend. Leading rabbis from the conservative wing of the national religious community (including Shmuel Eliyahu, Mordechai Sternberg, Micha Halevi and Shlomo Aviner) supported the rally, and a group of nationalist haredi rabbis issued a proclamation calling on the public to participate in the religious, Zionist rally.◊ô◊¶◊ê◊ï ◊û◊î◊ê◊®◊ï◊ü? ◊®◊ë◊†◊ô◊ù ◊ó◊®◊ì\\"◊ú◊ô◊ù ◊ô◊§◊í◊ô◊†◊ï ◊†◊í◊ì ◊í◊ô◊ï◊° ◊ú◊¶◊î\\"◊ú Other groups, such as the Tzohar and Beit Hillel rabbinical associations, and rabbis from the religious Zionist community (including Haim Druckman) opposed the protest.

Babin, a graduate of Lamar University and the University of Texas Dental Branch, served in the United States Air Force from 1975 to 1979. He then opened a dental practice in Woodville and became involved in Republican politics. He worked for various state and federal campaigns and held numerous local and regional government positions, including President of the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners (1981‚Äì1987), on the Deep East Texas Council of Governments (1982‚Äì1984), Mayor of Woodville (1982‚Äì1984), on the Woodville City Council (1984‚Äì1989), on the Texas Historical Commission (1989‚Äì1995), Chairman of the Tyler County Republican Party (1990‚Äì1995), on the Woodville Independent School District Board (1992‚Äì1995) and on the Lower Neches Valley Authority (1999‚Äì2015). Babin was the Republican nominee for Texas's 2nd congressional district in 1996 and 1998, losing to Democrat Jim Turner on both occasions. He ran again in 2014 to succeed Steve Stockman, who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate, and was elected to succeed him. Early and personal life Babin graduated from Lamar University in 1973 and later went on to serve as an officer in the United States Air Force from 1975 to 1979, leaving with the rank of Captain. While serving, he earned a B.S. in biology from Lamar University in 1975 and then enrolled in the University of Texas Dental Branch and graduated with his D.D.S. in 1976. To pay for his tuition, he worked as a janitor, merchant seaman and postman and sang folk and country music in local restaurants with his wife Roxanne, whom he met in college. Babin and his wife Roxanne have been married since 1972 and they have five children: daughter Marit, an attorney and former press staffer at the National Republican Congressional Committee; son Leif, a former Navy SEAL; twins Kirsten, an educator, and Lucas, a model and actor; and daughter Laura Larua. He is also the father-in-law of journalist and Fox News Channel anchor Jenna Lee, who is married to his son Leif. Babin and his wife are members of the First Baptist Church of Woodville, where he is a deacon, Sunday school teacher, choir member, and member of Gideons International. Career Babin has been engaged in general dental practice in Woodville since 1979. He first entered politics in 1980, saying that when stationed overseas he felt \\"demoralized\\" by Democratic President Jimmy Carter. He thus worked for the Ronald Reagan campaign for President, first as county co-ordinator and then regional co-ordinator. Deep East Texas was then heavily Democratic, and Babin is considered to be \\"instrumental\\" in turning the region Republican over the years. He also worked at the county, regional and state level for Reagan's re-election campaign, the George H. W. Bush campaign for President and the Bill Clements and George W. Bush campaigns for Governor of Texas. Additionally, he has variously served as the Mayor of Woodville (1982‚Äì1984), a Woodville City Councilman (1984‚Äì1989), Chairman of the Tyler County Republican Party (1990‚Äì1995), a member of the Woodville Independent School District Board (1992‚Äì1995) and Director of the Tyler County Chamber of Commerce. He has also served as President of the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners (1981‚Äì1987), on the Deep East Texas Council of Governments (1982‚Äì1984) and on the Texas Historical Commission (1989‚Äì1995). In 1999, he was appointed by Governor Bush to the Lower Neches Valley Authority and was reappointed to the body by Governor Rick Perry, most recently in 2013, for a term that was to expire in 2019. He resigned before being sworn into Congress. 1996 congressional election When twelve-term Democratic Congressman Charlie Wilson of Texas's 2nd congressional district decided to retire in 1996, Babin ran to succeed him. In the Republican primary, he came second out of five candidates, with 7,094 votes (31.01%), behind Donna Peterson, the nominee for the seat in 1990, 1992 and 1994, who took 8,047 votes (35.18%). As no candidate secured a majority, Babin faced Peterson in a runoff, and defeated her 7,405 votes (66.83%) to 3,675 (33.16%). In the general election, he lost to Democrat Jim Turner, a State Senator and former State Representative, by 102,908 votes (52.24%) to 89,838 (45.6%). After the 1996 election, Babin became involved in a campaign finance scandal concerning $37,000 in illegal donations from businessman Peter Cloeren that were moved through \\"vehicles\\" to circumvent the individual contribution limit of $1,000. Cloeren asserted in an affidavit that Babin and then-House Majority Whip Tom DeLay laundered his donations through other candidates and organisations. Babin and DeLay denied his allegations. Cloeren pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations and paid a $400,000 fine and received a two-year suspended prison sentence. Babin paid a $20,000 civil penalty and paid back $5,000 in excessive contributions for \\"accepting an excessive contribution and a contribution in the name of another and failing to disclose financial activity properly.\\" 1998 congressional election Babin sought a rematch with Turner in 1998. Unopposed in the Republican primary, he was again defeated in the general election, by 81,556 votes (58.42%) to 56,891 (40.75%). During the campaign, Babin's campaign manager was 21-year-old Jon-Marc McDonald. McDonald gained national attention when he simultaneously came out of the closet as a gay man and resigned as campaign manager. In August 1998, McDonald abruptly stepped down, citing \\"irreconcilable differences\\" with Babin over the issue of homosexuality. According to The Dallas Morning News, McDonald announced his resignation via press release without discussing it with Babin, and his sudden departure left those in the campaign shocked and confused. McDonald generated further press coverage when he stated in an interview after his resignation that Babin had made disparaging remarks about homosexuals in private, which Babin adamantly denied. In some press reports, Babin claimed that McDonald was not the campaign manager, but instead a \\"volunteer coordinator\\", also a paid position. An article by Hastings Wyman of the Southern Political Report suggested that McDonald was forced to resign by the local media threatening to \\"out\\" him. The resignation received widespread national media attention because of the sensationalistic way it transpired. U.S. House of Representatives =2014 Congressional election= After Republican Congressman Steve Stockman of Texas's 36th congressional district made a late decision to run for the U.S. Senate instead of for re-election, Babin ran to succeed him in the 2014 elections. In the twelve-candidate Republican primary‚Äìthe real contest in this heavily Republican district‚ÄìBabin finished first with 17,194 votes (33.36%). As he did not receive a majority, he proceeded to a runoff with the second-placed candidate, mortgage banker and candidate for Texas's 10th congressional district in 2004 Ben Streusand, who had received 12,024 votes (23.33%). In the runoff, Babin defeated Streusand by 19,301 votes (57.84%) to 14,069 (42.16%). He then faced Democrat Michael Cole in the general election, defeating him by 100,933 votes (75.97%) to 29,291 (22.04%). =2016 Congressional election= On November 27, 2015, Babin announced that he would be running for re-election in 2016. 2014 U.S. Senate candidate Dwayne Stovall, a bridge construction contractor, school board member from Cleveland and candidate for the State House of Representatives in 2012, announced in July 2015 that he would challenge Babin for the Republican nomination, but suspended his campaign in December 2015, citing poor fundraising and the difficulties of challenging an incumbent. Babin was thus unopposed in the March 1, 2016 Republican primary. The Democrats did not field a challenger in the November 8 general election; his only opposition came from face Green Party candidate Hal Ridley Jr., who also ran in 2014. =Committee assignments= * Committee on Science, Space and Technology ** Subcommittee on Environment ** Subcommittee on Space (Chairman) * Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure ** Subcommittee on Highways and Transit ** Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials ** Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment Source: =Caucus memberships= *Congressional Western Caucus =Tenure= On January 6, 2015, Babin was one of twenty-five House Republicans to vote against John Boehner's re-election as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. Boehner, who needed at least 205 votes, was re-elected with 216 votes. 24 Republicans voted for another candidate and Babin voted \\"present\\", effectively abstaining from the vote. Two days later, Babin explained his vote. He said that he didn't want to vote for Boehner, to reflect dissatisfaction with the Speaker in his district, particularly over the Cromnibus. However, he declined to vote for another candidate because \\"he would have preferred to see Boehner denied reelection on the first ballot, forcing a closed-door GOP caucus meeting at which a replacement might emerge.\\" On January 25, in an interview with The Daily Caller, Babin said that President Barack Obama \\"deserves impeachment\\", but he doubted that Congress would act on that. He also criticised President Obama's foreign policy, calling him an \\"appeaser deluxe\\". In June 2015, after the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in King v. Burwell that the tax subsidies in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly known as Obamacare) were constitutional, Babin introduced the \\"SCOTUScare Act\\". His bill would force the Supreme Court Justices to enroll for Obamacare and purchase healthcare insurance under the health exchanges, so that they could, as he said, \\"understand the full impact of their decisions on the American people [and] see firsthand what the American people are forced to live with!\\" The name of Babin's bill references conservative Justice Antonin Scalia's dissent, where he said that, after the Court had upheld the law twice, \\"we should start calling this law SCOTUScare.\\" In July 2015, Babin endorsed Texas Senator Ted Cruz for President. He praised Cruz' \\"conservative leadership and fortitude\\" and said that he \\"will speak honestly to the American people\\". In September 2015, in response to the Syrian refugee crisis, Babin introduced the Resettlement Accountability National Security Act, designed to oppose President Obama's plan to expand the country's refugee program. The bill calls for a \\"temporary halt to the refugee program until the general accounting office can do an assessment of just exactly how much this is costing the taxpayer.\\" Babin said that this was urgently necessary because the refugee program amounts to an \\"open invitation\\" to the \\"problems of the Middle East, of terrorism, oppression of women and all the things that go along with it.\\" Babin also claimed that over 90% of refugees \\"are already on some sort of entitlement program when they come in\\" and that American cities could end up with \\"no-go zones\\", claiming that such places already exist in London, Liverpool, Paris, Amsterdam and Copenhagen. On October 9, 2015, Babin chaired a hearing of the House Space Committee attended by various NASA executives. He criticised the Obama administration for cutting the NASA budget, saying that they would have a negative effect on the agency's space exploration programs and that budget uncertainty would impair efficiency. Babin also noted that the recent discovery of liquid water on Mars and the release of the Ridley Scott film The Martian had \\"garnered the public's attention, and rightly so\\" which would prompt the public to ask when there would be a Human mission to Mars. On October 20, 2016, Babin defended comments by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump calling Hillary Clinton \\"a nasty woman\\" at the final presidential debate, saying \\"sometimes a lady needs to be told when she's being nasty.\\" In June 2017 Babin asked President Trump in a letter to order a review of the case of Derrick Miller, a former US Army National Guardsman Sergeant who was sentenced in to life in prison with the chance of parole for the premeditated murder of an Afghan civilian during a battlefield interrogation, and the cases of other veterans who fought in Afghanistan and Iraq who were imprisoned for battlefield crimes. Political positions Babin cites water conservation, repealing the Affordable Care Act and stopping illegal immigration as his main priorities. He believes in the Protestant work ethic and the concept of \\"if you don‚Äôt work, you don‚Äôt eat, if you are able to work.\\" He supports term limits and wants to reduce the number of out of wedlock births and restore the traditional family unit. He also believes that taxes are too high and the tax code is too complex. Although Babin helped found and is a member of the Tyler County Patriots, he does not identify as a member of the Tea Party, saying \\"I believe with all my heart in less government, lower taxes and more individual responsibility and more economic freedom, and you can put whatever label you want to on it.\\" =National security= Babin supported President Donald Trump's 2017 executive order to temporarily curtail travel to the U.S. from six Middle Eastern nations until better screening methods are devised. After the EO was signed, he posted on social media: ‚ÄúGreat news ‚Äî now let‚Äôs get it into law!‚Äù = Transgender bathroom use = On May 19, 2016, Babin introduced HR 5294, the \\"Student Privacy Protection and Safety Act of 2016\\" which would invalidate the \\"Dear Colleague Letter on Transgender Students\\" until superseded by an Act of Congress. The \\"Dear Colleague\\" letter was an official correspondence jointly issued by the United States Departments of Justice and Education on May 13 providing significant guidance that Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, also prohibits discrimination based on a student's gender identity. Babin characterized HR 5294 as a \\"bathroom bill\\" in a subsequent press release, where he stated, in part, that \\"The federal government should not be in the business of throwing common sense and decency out the window and forcing local schools to permit a teenage boy who ‚Äòidentifies‚Äô as a girl to use changing rooms, locker rooms and bathrooms with five year-old girls.\\" Babin signed on to cosponsor HR 5275, the \\"Prohibiting the Usurpation of Bathroom Laws through Independent Choice School Act (PUBLIC School Act) of 2016\\" also on May 19. HR 5275 would allow state and local governments to enact and enforce policies on the use of sex-segregated bathrooms and locker rooms. He also cosponsored HR 5307, the \\"Title IX Clarification Act of 2016\\" on May 24. HR 5307 would amend Title IX to define sex as 'the biological sex'. Later in 2016, Babin cosponsored HR 5812, the \\"Civil Rights Uniformity Act of 2016\\" on September 27. All four bills (HR 5294, 5275, 5307, and 5812) would go on to die in committee. HR 5812 was reissued in 2017 as the \\"Civil Rights Uniformity Act of 2017\\" (HR 2796), which Babin cosponsored on June 7, 2017. QAnon On October 2, 2020, Babin opposed a bipartisan resolution condemning the baseless conspiracy theory movement QAnon. The resolution passed overwhelmingly on a vote of 371-18. The FBI has identified the movement as a domestic terrorism threat. BuzzFeed reported earlier this week that followers of QAnon targeted the resolution's author, New Jersey Democratic U.S. Rep. Tom Malinowski, with death threats. Malinowski's resolution condemned and rejected the conspiracy theories the movement promotes and included a list of crimes in which the perpetrators cited QAnon as a guiding inspiration. The resolution additionally pointed to FBI and U.S. military warnings about the movement's potential to foment political tension and radicalization.

Biography  Hasanwayh was the son of a certain Husayn and was from the Kurdish tribe of Barzikani. By 961, Hasanwayh managed to capture several fortresses, thus starting the Hasanwayhid dynasty. He managed to successfully resist Sahlan ibn Musafir, the Buyid governor of Hamadan, and the Buyid vizier, Abu 'l-Fadl ibn al-'Amid. In 970 he reached a compromise with Abu 'l-Fadl's successor which guaranteed his autonomy in return for a tribute of 50,000 dinars. On September 16, 976, Rukn al-Dawla, the Buyid ruler of Jibal, died. After his death, Izz al-Dawla, the Buyid ruler of Iraq, prepared to take revenge against Rukn al- Dawla's son Adud al-Dawla, who had tried to depose him. Izz al-Dawla made an alliance with Fakhr al-Dawla, the brother of Adud al-Dawla and his father's successor to the territories in Hamadan. He also made an alliance with the Hamdanids prevailing in northern Iraq, and with Hasanwayh. However, Mu'ayyad al-Dawla, the third son of Rukn al-Dawla, remained loyal to Adud al-Dawla. Adud al-Dawla managed to defeat Izz al-Dawla and his allies. Hasanwayh then made peace with Adud al-Dawla, and was spared by him. Hasanwayh later died in 979 at Sarmaj, located in the south of Bisitun. A civil war shortly ensued among his sons, while the Buyid civil war continued between Adud al-Dawla and Fakhr al-Dawla. Adud al-Dawla emerged victorious, and expelled Fakhr al-Dawla from the Buyid territories. Adud al-Dawla then had all Hasanwayh's sons executed, except one named Badr ibn Hasanwayh, whom he appointed ruler of the Hasanwayhid dynasty.

Originating as tropical low over the Timor Sea on 30 January, Fletcher quickly became an organised system as it moved over the Top End region of the Northern Territory. Once over the Gulf of Carpentaria on 2 February, deep convection formed near its center and the following day it became a tropical cyclone. With peak winds estimated at 65 km/h (40 mph), the storm made landfall in Queensland before weakening to a low. Over the following week, the system's movement became slow and erratic. Executing three loops, the former cyclone meandered over the southeastern Gulf of Carpentaria before accelerating southwest and later west. Fletcher was last noted on 12 February over the Alice Springs District in the Northern Territory. Meteorological history Tropical Cyclone Fletcher was first identified as a tropical low on 30 January 2014 over the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf in the Timor Sea. Tracking generally eastward, the well-organized system moved over the Top End region of the Northern Territory of Australia. Westerly monsoonal flow from the north promoted a steady east-southeast track, Early on 2 February, the low emerged over the Gulf of Carpentaria near the Northern Territory‚ÄìQueensland border. Moderate to strong wind shear produced by an upper-level low to the south initially inhibited development, keeping convective activity limited to isolated bursts around an exposed low-level circulation. Throughout 2 February, environmental conditions quickly turned more favorable for tropical cyclogenesis, with a newly formed anticyclone over the low lessening shear. As a result, convection steadily increased in coverage and organisation despite the system's proximity to land. Improved radar presentation and surface observations of near-gale winds prompted the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) to upgrade the system to a tropical cyclone early on 3 February; coincidingly, they assigned the name Fletcher to the storm. At this time, the center of the small storm was located a few dozen kilometres north of Karumba, Queensland. The BOM estimated sustained winds to be 65 km/h (40 mph) and the barometric pressure at 992 hPa (29.29 inHg), which proved to be Fletcher's peak intensity. Contrary to the BOM, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) maintained the system as a tropical disturbance with one-minute sustained winds estimated at 55 km/h (35 mph) and a pressure of 998 hPa (29.47 inHg). A Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued by the agency on 3 February, but no advisories were ultimately issued. Fletcher only lasted as a tropical cyclone for a few hours before being downgraded to a tropical low as it made landfall in Queensland later on 3 February, between Karumba and the mouth of the Gilbert River. Once onshore, Fletcher's motion became slow and highly erratic as a building mid-level ridge to the south prompted a more westerly track. On 4 February, the storm executed a tight clockwise loop before turning westward back over the Gulf of Carpentaria on 5 February. During this time, convection became displaced to the northwest while the circulation center was left exposed. The former cyclone gradually became more monsoonal in nature, with convection developing along a convergence line rather than in curved banding features. The poorly organised system became difficult to follow, though a small central dense overcast feature along the south side of its center allowed forecasters to discern its location. Despite moving back over water on 5 February and environmental conditions favoring redevelopment, convection failed to form around the low and instead, continued to flare along the convergence zone to the north. The remnant system then became nearly stationary just offshore for two days before adopting a slow north-northeasterly track. Early on 8 February, Fletcher brushed the Queensland coast just north of the mouth of the Gilbert River before accelerating southwestward. After completing two loops in its track, the system subsequently made its final landfall to the east of Burketown, Queensland on 9 February. As the storm passed close to the town, a pressure of 997 hPa (29.44 inHg) was observed along with wind gusts of up to 65 km/h (40 mph). Maintaining a general westward track, the remnants of Fletcher gradually weakened and were last noted on 12 February over the Alice Springs District in the Northern Territory. Preparations and impact =Northern Territory= As the precursor tropical low to Cyclone Fletcher produced heavy rains across much of the Top End region in late January and early February, the BOM issued flood advisories for the Darwin-Daly Districts. Squalls associated with the low raised concerns over abnormally high tides, namely the potential for beach erosion and coastal flooding. The Northern Territory Government launched a trial run of an early-warning phone system during this event. Residents in the Rapid Creek catchment were notified via mobile device about the possibility of flooding from the storm. Over the Adelaide River catchment, fell causing the river to exceed major flood level in the town of Adelaide River on 1 February. Rising to , the river inundated mostly rural areas, including a cattle farm in Mount Bundy Station where a calf had to be rescued by boat. Along the Douglas River, of rain fell over three days. Minor to moderate flooding also occurred along the Katherine and Daly Rivers. Darwin experienced several days of heavy rains and squally winds from the system, with accumulations reaching and gusts peaking at on 31 January. More than a week later, the remnants produced further rains across southern areas of the state. Roughly of rain fell across the Roper-McArthur and Victoria river districts, leading to significant water level rise. Moderate flooding took place in Kalkarindji along the Victoria River on 12‚Äì13 February while low-lying areas along the McArthur River in Borroloola flooded on both 10 and 13 February. Along the Northern Territory‚ÄìQueensland border, fell in Wollogorang. As the remnants passed near Tennant Creek, wind gusts reached , though rainfall was fairly limited with only falling. =Queensland= Owing to a wetter-than-average January, cattle herders in Queensland moved their herds to higher ground. During the time in which Fletcher became nearly stationary over the southeastern Gulf of Carpentaria, it produced prolonged and heavy rains across much of western Queensland. Many areas experienced a week of continuous rainfall, with Kowanyama measuring at least for six days straight, including a daily peak of . Total rains from Fletcher's passage amounted to over an eight-day span. These rains greatly contributed to making February 2014 the wettest month on record in Kowanyama, with ultimately recorded. Normanton, situated near where Fletcher made landfall on 3 February, saw considerably less rainfall, with total accumulations of . Mornington Island also experienced considerably less rainfall, with falling over 11 days. On 2 February, as Fletcher passed south of the island, wind gusts peaked at . In Far North Queensland, near-gale to gale-force wind gusts affected coastal areas around Weipa for three days; a maximum gust of was measured on 5 February. A total of of rain fell in Weipa as both Fletcher and the nearby monsoon brought continuous moisture to the region. Near where Fletcher made landfall for a final time on 9 February, Burketown experienced gale-force winds on both 9 and 10 February as the remnants of Fletcher tracked westward. Rainfall in the town amounted to over a nine-day period. Flooding in Kowanyama began on 3 February as roads \\"turned into rivers\\" and the land around the town turned into a swamp. The mayor of Kowanyama described the town as \\"its own little island.\\" However, residents were prepared for the storm and had supplies stocked up. Owing to the weak nature of the storm, no wind damage occurred throughout Queensland.

Description and history The Howe-Quimby House is located in a rural setting in southwestern Hopkinton, on the west side of Sugar Hill Road, north of its junction with Holmes Road. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is oriented facing south and is five bays wide. The main entrance, set at its center, is flanked by sidelight windows and pilasters, and is topped by a transom window and corniced entablature. The interior follows a center chimney plan, with a narrow entrance vestibule, chambers to either side of the chimney, and a large rear kitchen with smaller chambers at the corners. Many of the rooms have woodwork that is either original to the construction, or were the result of an early 19th century Greek Revival update. A 1-1/2 story frame ell extends to one side. The main block of the house was built between 1766 and 1784 by David Howe, and sold to Jonathan Quimby in 1784. The basic styling of the exterior is Georgian, although the main and side entries received Greek Revival treatment, with door hoods and sidelight windows. The interior of the house is divided in its styling: after Jonathan Quimby's death, the inside was divided between his wife and eldest son. The wife maintained her side of the house with Georgian/Federal styling, while his son updated his side with Greek Revival features.

Born in Buffalo in 1877 and educated at Brown, Harvard, and the universities of Chicago and Wisconsin, Johnson conducted research at the Anatomical Laboratory of the University of Wisconsin and at the Carnegie Institution's Station for Experimental Evolution. He joined the Carnegie staff in July 1905 as an assistant to Charles Davenport, the nation's most influential eugenicist in the first quarter of the twentieth century. Johnson's early work involved ladybugs, whose short life cycle made them ideal for studying evolution. He also developed techniques for locating underground petroleum reserves. Career in Pittsburgh Johnson began teaching at the University of Pittsburgh in 1912 as an instructor in biology and assistant professor of oil and gas mining.

Johnson attempted to counter the demographic effects of mass immigration by encouraging greater reproduction rates from native-born men and women of relative affluence. His plans relied upon acceptance of inherent inequality, which drove him to negative measures. Johnson viewed government- funded birth control, incarceration, sterilization, and restricted marriage licensing as rational devices. He developed his views amid the expansion of both nativism and social scientific investigation in the United States during the 1910s and 1920s. He co-authored the prominent Applied Eugenics with Paul Popenoe in 1918. Career after Pittsburgh After receiving a doctorate in sociology from the University of Pittsburgh in 1934, he announced in the American Journal of Sociology that he would thereafter teach solely in the field of sociology. He left Pitt in 1935 to teach eugenics and social hygiene as a part-time instructor at the University of Hawaii. He also served as the staff social hygienist for the Palama Settlement, a Honolulu medical and social work institution. By the end of the 1930s, he lived in Los Angeles and served as the director of personal service for Popenoe's American Institute of Family Relations. The Institute preached the benefits of medical testing and stressed disciplined study as the best way for single men and women to prepare for marriage. Johnson's work for the AIFR brought his thinking about reproduction full circle. In his 1948 book Looking Toward Marriage, he summarized decades of experience in counseling singles. Traits such as stability, sympathy, \\"self-mastery,\\" intelligence, and health produced the best chances for a successful marriage, he noted. Singles had to be realistic about their chances of finding a partner and honest to prospective partners about their aspirations and limitations.

A large cross and several memorial plaques commemorate the place which was the principal execution site used by the Nazi German occupiers of Warsaw during the Wola massacre, one of the most brutal massacres of civilians during the Second World War, which took place between 5 and 12 August 1944, in the early days of the Warsaw Uprising. Up to 10,000 Polish men, women and children were murdered at the site. History In early August 1944, German troops sent to suppress the Warsaw Uprising massacred 40,000‚Äì50,000 inhabitants of the district of Wola, mainly in organised mass executions. On the express orders of Adolf Hitler, people were murdered regardless of their age or sex. The greatest number of killings took place in the area near G√≥rczewska and Moczyd≈Ça streets, in particular at a building on G√≥rczewska Street located near a railway embankment. The mass executions at this site began on 4 August and continued until 8 August 1944. The greatest number of victims were killed on 5 August (known as \\"Black Saturday\\"). Historians estimate that up to 10,000 Polish people - men, women and children - were executed near the location of the memorial. After rounding up and killing the victims, the Germans burned the bodies, which made a precise determination of the number of people murdered here impossible. It is known, however, that among the victims were residents of the following streets: Dzia≈Çdowska, Gosty≈Ñska, G√≥rczewska, Moczyd≈Ço, P≈Çocka, Rabszty≈Ñska, Skierniewicka, Soko≈Çowska, Staszica, Syreny, Szlenkier√≥w, ≈õw. Wojciecha, Tyszkiewicza, Wawelberga, Zbo≈ºowa and ≈ªytnia. The Germans also murdered around 360 patients from Wola Hospital on P≈Çocka Street (now the Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases) and three priests from Saint Wojciech's Church (Ko≈õci√≥≈Ç ≈öwiƒôtego Wojciecha) on Wolska Street. Commemoration By the first anniversary of the massacre, a wooden cross had been placed at the site of the murders and a commemoration took place at the initiative of employees of Wola Hospital, who still care for the memorial to this day. In the early 1950s, a Tchorek plaque was added to the memorial. Controversy In 2004, a Nissan car showroom was built in the area behind the memorial and there was a proposal to transfer the cross to the nearby railway embankment. This idea met with protests, especially from survivors of the Warsaw Uprising, who argued that its implementation would be insulting to the victims. As a result, the memorial was left intact, and the Council for the Protection of Struggle and Martyrdom Sites and the authorities of the City of Warsaw also decided to renovate it. The current state of the memorial In 2010, the memorial was supplemented by another plaque, containing a more a detailed description of the crimes carried out at the site. In addition, the Council for the Protection of Struggle and Martyrdom Sites ordered and funded a new steel cross, which replaced the old wooden cross. The image of Christ - visible on the metal casing of the cross - was composed in the form of an annealed trace. The bottom section of the cross is also blackened, to symbolise the burning of the corpses of the victims by the so-called Verbrennungskommando. The renovated memorial was officially unveiled on 5 August 2012, the 68th anniversary of the Wola massacre. Further renovation work was carried out in July 2014, followed by another unveiling on 5 August 2014, the 70th anniversary of the massacre.

He is known principally for his work on legal and ethical issues in end-of-life decision-making and euthanasia, surgery and paediatrics and is the author of a number of books on these themes; Law, Ethics and Compromise at the Limits of Life: To Treat or Not to Treat? (2012), Euthanasia, Ethics and the Law: From Conflict to Compromise (2007) and (with Dickenson & Parker) The Cambridge Medical Ethics Workbook (CUP, 2nd edn, 2010). He has also produced numerous chapters, and articles for both academic journals and mainstream newspapers. Huxtable is best known for his controversial position on the role of \\"principled compromise\\" in responding to conflict over the care of a critically ill, incapacitated patient. Huxtable has argued that the law governing both the welfare (or \\"best interests\\") of the patient and any wishes they might have conveyed, via an \\"advance directive\\" or through the appointment of a \\"lasting power of attorney\\", frequently fail to furnish clinicians and families with the guidance they require in these difficult cases. He has proposed that there is a case for \\"principled compromise\\" here, and has argued for greater ethical engagement, through a reinvigorated system of clinical ethics support, in which committees work alongside the courts to resolve the conflicts that can arise at the limits of life.  Education and career  Born and educated in South Wales, Richard Huxtable studied Law at the University of Nottingham before completing a PhD on Assisted Dying and English Law at the University of Bristol, where he now teaches. He has held visiting positions at the Ethox Centre in the University of Oxford, the Centre for Biomedical Ethics in the National University of Singapore and the Hastings Center, New York. A long-standing participant in clinical ethics consultation, Huxtable is a member of the UHBT Clinical Ethics Advisory Group and a Trustee of both the UK Clinical Ethics Network and of the National Council for Palliative Care. His research has been funded by organisations including the Wellcome Trust and the European Commission and he has given invited presentations at the Royal Society of Medicine and the Royal College of Surgeons.

Description and history The Keniston Bridge is located in a rural setting west of Andover's main village, carrying Bridge Street over the Blackwater River a short way south of U.S. Route 4. It is a single-span Town truss, mounted on granite bridge abutments that have been partially rebuilt in concrete. Much of the fabric of the bridge is original, although strengthening elements (wooden chords and steel beams) have been added to the trusses and the road bed, and portions of the downstream truss have been replaced. The bridge is topped by a wooden shingle roof, and measures in length and in width. The distance between the abutments on which it rests is . The bridge was built by a local builder, Albert Hamilton, and underwent repairs and renovations in 1949 and 1981. Most of the strengthening elements enabling it to carry heavier loads have been effectively hidden behind its sheathing or beneath its main structure. Unlike many of the state's surviving covered bridges, its sides are not completely sheathed, with vertical siding only rising about . The bridge has survived in part because it is on a minor road that sees very little traffic.

Ballerstedt was mainly known as leader of the secessionist Bayernbund Prussian Legation Munich to the Foreign Office. 6 April 1920, Bundesarchiv.

It is thus clear by two different organizations. and as a political rival of Adolf Hitler in the early days of his political career who caused Hitler to be jailed for a month in 1922. Life and work  =Empire and the First World War= Ballerstedt was born in Munich. He was the son of Dr. Otto Ballerstedt Senior, a well-known editor of the M√ºnchner Neueste Nachrichten, and his wife Julie, n√©e Lagel.Otto Gritschneder: \\"The F√ºhrer has sentenced to death ...\\" Hitler \\"R√∂hm-Putsch\\" murders to justice , CH Beck, Munich 1993, , p 122 His uncle, Max Ballerstedt, was a famous paleontologist. Ballerstedt completed his engineering studies with a degree in electrical engineering. In the First World War Ballerstedt was a Bavarian Army officer. In August 1914, he was wounded in the head and lost an eye. Towards the end of the war he made his first political move: In April 1918, he demanded the Bavarian King Ludwig III petition on not allowing the newly acquired territories to fall to Prussia, against the backdrop of the extensive German territorial gains in the peace treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Russia. As Prussia was already considered too powerful within the Federation of German territories, he thought an annexation of the Baltic States to Prussia would allow its influence to grow further.Karl-Ludwig Ay: The emergence of a revolution , 1968, p 138 =Bayernbund and engagement with Hitler= After the German defeat in the autumn of 1918 Ballerstedt founded the at times very successful Bayernbund, accentuating regional autonomy and the peculiarities of regional political organization that aimed at a reorganisation of the German Reich on a \\"strictly federal basis\\". Ballerstedt - \\"white blue\\" and monarchist-minded - thought that, while respecting the unity of the Empire, the inner autonomy and independence of the individual federal States should be significantly strengthened. As the founder and leader of the Bayernbund, Ballerstedt was a very prominent figure in the politics of the State and its capital in the early 1920s. Adolf Hitler, who entered the political arena at that time, looked at the \\"separatists\\" - as he called Ballerstedt's organisation - as a rival and had violent conflicts for a while with the Bayernbund; he attacked editorially and physically by raiding its political rallies with militant thugs. Hitler described Ballerstedt later in one of his monologues in the Fuehrer's headquarters during the Second World War in retrospect as his most dangerous opponent on the field of activity as a public speaker. Robert Payne: The Life and Death of Adolf Hitler, 1973, S.160. '‚ÄûAs an orator, Ballerstedt was my most dangerous opponent. What a feat it was to hold my own against him! His father was a Hessian, his mother was from Lorraine. He was a diabolical dialectician. To give his hearers the impression that he agreed with them, he'd begin with a eulogy of the Prussians. I've been condemned several times for accusing this man of treason‚Äî and yet, he was in fact sold to the French.‚Äú' On 14 September 1921, there was a highly publicized incident, when Hitler, Hermann Esser, Oskar K√∂rner (later to die in the Beer Hall Putsch) and some other NSDAP supporters stormed a Ballerstedt meeting in the Munich L√∂wenbr√§ukeller in order to prevent him giving a lecture. Hitler achieved this goal by drastic measures: He reached Ballerstedt, then assaulted and injured him severely. Ballerstedt was then forcibly dragged out of the Hall. As a result, Hitler was on trial from 27 to 29 January 1922 on charges of a breach of the peace, public indecency and assault. He and Esser were convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for 100 days and payment of 1,000 Reichsmark. The prison sentence was served from 24 June to 27 July 1922 in Munich Stadelheim prison, where Hitler remained only a month.Richard J Evans: The Coming of the Third Reich. A History, 2004, S. 181; Joachim Fest: Hitler, 2002, S. 160 und 225. =Later years of life and assassination= From 1925, Ballerstedt moved more and more into the background politically. In the early 1930s, he moved to the writing of photographically-illustrated landscape and cultural heritage books. Ballerstedt was arrested on the evening of 30 June 1934 by armed SS men in his Munich apartment, a day before going on a planned trip to Austria. He was killed during the Night of the Long Knives in or near Dachau concentration camp and his body found on the morning of 1 July in the forest near G√ºndinger Neuhimmelreich. The autopsy revealed that he had died by a shot to the back of the head.(Kimmel: KZ Dachau, S. 366;) Garg: Justice in the Third Reich, p. 439 in combination with international Dachau Committee: Dachau notebooks, vol. 8-9, p. 222 At the same time as he was shot, Fritz Beck, Fritz Gerlich, Wilhelm Eduard Schmid and the housekeeper Ernestine Zoref were also murdered.

He resigned the Chair of Astronomy to become Professor of Natural Philosophy in 1803, a position he held until his death in 1846. Meikleham's first post was Rector of Ayr Academy in 1792. In 1794 he was employed as assistant to the Professor of Natural Philosophy. He conducted his duties so successfully that he continued to take classes after the incumbent Professor's death and during the tenure of his successor. In August 1799, King George III issued a commission to William Meikleham to be Professor of Practical Astronomy and Observer at the University of Glasgow, and on 29 October 1799 he was admitted to office. Professor William Meikleham had none of the fiercely conservative attitudes of others in the University. He proved to be a much more active and dynamic teacher than his colleagues, including his successor in the Chair of Practical Astronomy, James Couper. Appearance No pictures exist of William Meikleham however he was described by Elizabeth Thomson, Lord Kelvin's sister, as a good-natured, fat, little hunchback with a very red face. Early life and studies William Meikleham was born in 1771 at Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, Scotland, the second son of schoolmaster William McIlquham. He was a student at the University of Glasgow, from 1788 to 1792. During his time there he won several prizes and graduated MA. Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow On 9 November 1802 William Meikleham helped to found the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow and became its first president. The seal of the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow is thought to depict the transit of Mercury that occurred on the morning of 9 November 1802 ‚Äì the day of the first meeting of the Society. It is speculation that William Meikleham proposed the Seal design having observed the transit that very morning. Chair of Natural Philosophy In August 1803 William Meikleham transferred from the Astronomy Chair to the Chair of Natural Philosophy. He was elected Clerk of Faculty in 1829 and 1830. He continued to lecture until the academic session of 1838-39, his health deteriorated and his classes were latterly covered by others in the department. By 1841 it became clear that Meikleham was unlikely to return to his classes and he died on 7 May 1846 aged 75. Later life William Meikleham appears in the Post Office Glasgow Directories from 1801 to 1803 as Professor of Practical Astronomy. Then from 1804 until 1815 as Professor of Natural Philosophy. Although he continues to be professor of Natural Philosophy until his death in 1846 he does not appear to have a Glasgow address from 1816 onwards.

She is considered to be a pioneer of Czech modern dance, having taught Isadora Duncan's method from the 1930s. Life Born in Prague, she was the daughter of violinist Franti≈°ek Je≈ô√°bek, the leader of the National Theatre orchestra, while her mother had studied art and music in Munich. Interested in Sokol, the Czech youth sport movement, she took summer classes from 1929 to 1932 at Schloss Klessheim near Salzburg, where she trained in dancing under Elizabeth Duncan, the sister of the innovative dancer Isadora Duncan. She married Ing. Ladislav Mikul√≠k but kept her surname. They had two sons, Radvan and Zbynƒõk Mikul√≠k. Career From 1932, Je≈ô√°bkov√° taught music and dance, first at Slan√Ω, then in Prague where in 1937 her school became known as \\"Jarmila Je≈ô√°bkov√°‚Äôs School of Artistic Dance founded under the personal direction of Elizabeth Duncan\\". Like the Duncans, she also arranged open-air summer courses at Velk√© Opatovice Castle. From 1935 to 1948, she staged performances with her pupils in Prague and other Czech towns. They included stylized Slavonic dance (performed to the music of Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k's Slavonic Dances) and works accompanying the music of the Czech Choir. Members of the group included Onta Jankovsk√°, Marta Horov√°, D√°≈°a Bittnerov√°, Jarina Smol√°kov√°, Elv√≠ra Ma≈ôatkov√°, Dana Bo≈ôkovcov√° and Bƒõla Dintrov√°. As a result of socialist nationalization, the school was abolished in 1948 but was later revived as a cultural centre. From 1949, Je≈ô√°bkov√° took up a number of pedagogical and research assignments in body posture, physical education, gymnastics and music.

Baldwin (1 August 1921 ‚Äì 30 December 1995) was an English evangelical biblical scholar and theological educator who became one of the leading women in the field of biblical scholarship in her day. At a time when the Church of England did not ordain women to any of its orders (deacon, priest or bishop), she championed the cause of women's ministry through influential writing, teaching and practical example.Obituary, The Times, 15 January 1996.  Biography  Joyce Baldwin was born in Essex, but her family later moved to Nottingham. She studied at Mundella Grammar School and the University of Nottingham. Baldwin began her professional career as a teacher of modern languages in Lancashire, England. In 1947 she trained for ministry with the China Inland Mission, gaining a diploma in theology from the University of London whilst studying for missionary service. In 1949, she travelled to China, joining the CIM language school in Chongquing. Her missionary service was curtailed by communist restrictions, which forced CIM to withdraw its overseas missionaries. She left China in 1951, seriously ill with dysentery. This illness led to her being unable to recommence missionary service again. Instead, she became a lecturer at Dalton House in Bristol (a training college for women missionaries and Anglican parish workers), which led to her lifelong career as a teacher of Old Testament, along with Philosophy and Ethics. She swiftly attained her degree in divinity, eventually becoming Vice-Principal and then Principal of Dalton House. In 1971, Dalton House amalgamated with the two men's Anglican colleges in Bristol, Clifton Theological College and Tyndale Hall, to form Trinity College, Bristol. Joyce Baldwin became Dean of Women of the newly formed college, working alongside Alec Motyer, as Principal and J.I. Packer, as Vice-Principal. When Alec Motyer retired, George Carey was appointed to succeed him. However, Carey postponed taking up his new office for a year, in order to prepare his parish, St Nicholas, Durham, for the forthcoming vacancy. Joyce Baldwin was appointed Principal for a fixed-term to cover the intervening year until her own retirement. Joyce Baldwin was author of a number of commentaries on Old Testament books, including Daniel and Esther. She also spoke and wrote in favour of the ordination of women.Griffiths, p. 337. In 1983, she married Jack Caine, a friend whom she had known as a teenager, following the rekindling of their friendship shortly before her retirement. She was ordained deacon following the Church of England's decision to admit women to that order in 1987. However, when the decision was made to admit women to the priesthood, she declined to be further ordained, feeling that her life's calling had already been fulfilled. Tremper Longman describes her as a \\"balanced and sane exegete\\".Tremper Longman III, Old Testament Commentary Survey, 2nd ed. (Grand Rapids: Baker, 1999), 140.

It provides information to thousands of people each year through its Research Library and The Bronx County Archives, by mail, over the phone, and via digital communication. The Society also works with the New York Public Library's Bronx Library Center and its branch libraries in sharing these resources. The Bronx County Historical Society is digitizing select portions of its collections. The Society honors Bronx High School valedictorians with an annual awards ceremony held at the Museum of Bronx History. The Society is also the largest publisher of books and articles about the Bronx and produces the oldest continuously published historical periodical in the New York metropolitan area, The Bronx County Historical Society Journal (see Publications).

The Research Library houses over 7,000 books, directories, pamphlets, newspapers, and periodicals, a growing number of which now also exist in digital formats, as well as more than 200 atlases and sheet maps. Its extensive Photograph Collection comprises 75,000 photographs and slides, which include around 3,000 rare and vivid nineteenth- and early twentieth-century glass negatives; and 1,600 postcards, which primarily depict early twentieth-century Bronx scenes.

Finally, the Research Library's Vertical file collection includes more than 400,000 newspaper clippings and other print ephemera on a comprehensive variety of Bronx subjects. The Bronx County Archives The Bronx County Historical Society founded The Bronx County Archives in 1974 to act as a repository for Bronx municipal records. Since that date, The Bronx County Archives have acquired a dedicated building, located next door to The Bronx County Historical Society Research Library, equipped with moisture- and temperature- controlled storage space. The Bronx County Archives currently house 114 individual collections, which comprise around 3205 cubic feet and uniquely document many aspects of Bronx history. These aspects include Bronx businesses and economic development; city planning and infrastructure; civic organizations and clubs; culture and cultural institutions; capital disinvestment and urban devastation; education; healthcare; housing and cooperatives; local history; municipal records; politicians and political parties; and radicalism and community activism. The Bronx County Archives also contain especially rich documentation of Black and Jewish life and culture in the borough. A growing number of archival collections document Latino life and culture in the Bronx as well. As of July 2020, finding aids have been created for the majority of collections and will be provided to researchers upon request. National landmark historic houses In addition to the Bronx County Historical Society Research Library and The Bronx County Archives, The Bronx County Historical Society also administers two national landmark historic houses, the Edgar Allan Poe Cottage, the former home of the American writer Edgar Allan Poe, and the Valentine‚ÄìVarian House, a colonial-era farmhouse that also hosts the Museum of Bronx History.

The initial participants were in favor of supporting the cabinet of the second Azarov government, President Viktor Yanukovych, and closer ties with Russia. After the overthrow of Yanukovych, anti-Maidan became divided into various other groups, which partially overlapped. These ranged from people protesting against social ills, to supporters of a federalization of Ukraine, to pro- Russian separatists and nationalists.https://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/ssees/2014/05/09/south-eastern-ukraine- extremism-and-the-anti-maidan/ Protests of Anti-Maidan by date =November 2013 rallies= A pro-government counter protest reportedly gathered 10,000 people on 25 November (the reference does not contain any information about the pro-government protests).

The event lasted only 1 hour. Reports indicated attendees were paid UAH‚Ç¥50 to attend, and reports indicated that many were public sector workers who did not attend on their own accord. The rally was both pro-administration and pro-European Integration. A rally in support of President Yanukovych held by the Donetsk Regional State Administration and the Party of Regions was to be held in Donetsk on 2 December, but was cancelled due to failure to organise enough people. On 3 December, 1,000 attended a rally in Kyiv put on by the Party of Regions to support the president.

Police heavily guarded this event from not only anti-government protesters, but also from any journalists and on-lookers. According to Segodnya, people attending the pro-government Marinsky Park event were hired or obliged to attend, and forced to stay for a pre-determined time. In one incident on 8 December, protesters were held at the rally against their will by armed security. Speaking on condition of anonymity to the Kyiv Post, one demonstrator said that participants of the rally are paid UAH‚Ç¥300 or more in order to earn money without going to work. She also recalled cases when they were not let outside the rally for the whole day, while inside the camp there was a build up of garbage and dirty toilets on the grounds. Mark MacKinnon, senior international correspondent for The Globe and Mail, attempted to interview a demonstrator at the ongoing Anti-Maidan, but although was refused the demonstrator indicated to him that she actually supported the Euromaidan protests.

The 'corridor' on Khreshchatyk between the Euromaidan and 'Anti-Maidan' demonstrations, looking towards Maidan Nezalezhnosti, 8:00 am, 14 December. On 14 December the Party of Regions announced that they intended to hold a rally on European Square under the banner \\"Let's Save Ukraine\\". The move to create a second rally in the city by officials was condemned by former president Leonid Kravchuk. According to party officials, 20,000 were expected to come from Donetsk and 10,000 from Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Many others were expected to arrive from the Crimea, Odessa Oblast, and a number of other regions. In the lead up to the rally, it was reported on 12 December that \\"thousands\\" of residents from Dnipropetrovsk (mostly government employees, students of technical schools, and athletes) were traveling to Kyiv to join in the pro-government rallies. Those interviewed said they were doing so reluctantly, and only for two days, at a rate of UAH‚Ç¥400‚Äì500 a day. It was also reported that state employees were coerced to join the group under threat of dismissal. On the day of the rally, UDAR MP Roman Chereha accused officials of bringing in children from shelters, promising them food and shelter. On 13 December, the Donetsk regional organisation of The Party of Regions said that people wishing to go to Kyiv would be provided food rations and would be transported on a specially commissioned train, paid for by the party. In Odessa, several trains carrying roughly 3,000 departed the city carrying students and teachers to participate in the pro-government rally; students, some from the Odessa Law Academy, admitted they would receive school credit for attending; others would receive financial compensation. It was similarly reported in Luhansk that over 1,000 had departed via rail, and those attending were largely coal miners from the region. Luhansk mayor Sergei Kravchenko in an address stated that over 1,500 residents would support the government at the rally. Meanwhile, in Zaporizhia, it was reported that a train packed with 1,600 \\"athletic men and workers of state enterprises and companies\\" was departing to Kyiv. Conductors said it was a private, rented train with tickets not available to the public. In a list released by journalist Tatiana Honchenko, a total of 27 trains, each with on average 20 cars had been rented by the Party of Regions for the weekend event to transport supporters from across Ukraine to Kyiv. Opposition leaders Arseniy Yatseniuk and Ihor Miroshnychenko issued a warning, citing inside information, that authorities were planning to use the large pro-government rally in order to start a civil conflict and justify issuing a state of emergency, which would require the use of Berkut riot police and military to clear European Square and Maidan. Yatsenyuk specifically warned against the use of hired thugs (titushky) who will infiltrate and start to wreak havoc in the pro-European encampment cloaked in either European Union or national colours. Opposition leader Yuriy Lutsenko, however, called for calm and assured that the pro-government rally will be attended by peaceful, state-paid employees and students. Oleksandr Yefremov, head of the Party of Regions parliamentary faction reiterated: \\"This will be an exclusively peaceful demonstration, our people are always easy to get along with ... we will also rely on the police to create a safe buffer between the two rallies\\". However, a statement by Party of Regions MP Vadym Kolesnichenko acknowledged the creation of vigilante groups being formed in the south-east of Ukraine and across Crimea to \\"protect public order and the Constitution\\", and that one such group in Sevastopol already had already amassed 800 recruits; adding that they would be involved in the events of the weekend. In an interview by Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty with an attendee on the day of the event, the subject (who taught boxing) revealed that he and a group of others were offered UAH‚Ç¥1,000 by organisers to instigate a fight with protesters on Maidan. The Interior Ministry's press service told the Kyiv Post on 13 December that the pro-government rally received permission to have up to 200,000 in attendance. According to Zerkalo Nedeli, one of the nation's most influential newspapers, the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine and government ordered the Ministry of Defense to aid in the provision of security, logistics, deployment of field kitchens, and transportation of 200,000 civilians to hold a pro-government rally in Kyiv on the weekend of 14‚Äì15 December. The Ministry of Internal Affairs is said to have been requested to aid in the security for those coming to Kyiv from other regions of the country. The report was covered in the media by The Insider, UNIAN, and Ukrayinska Pravda. The Minister of Defense later denied these rumors, citing Article 17 and Article 37 of the Ukrainian Constitution, which prohibits the participation of the Ukrainian Armed Forces in domestic political fights. Despite this, on 13 December tents were seen being set up on property owned by the Ministry of Defense, and in a separate report by Zerkalo Nedeli it was revealed that the Ministry of Defense had been conducting training exercises over the previous two days, including taking inventory of equipment (ex. field kitchens, vehicles) for support of the pro-governmental protests. Resources were also transferred to Ukpromakord, the food supplier of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Further, on the day of the event witnesses reported and photographed 40 military field kitchens serving pro-government supporters in Mariinsky Park. Prime Minister Mykola Azarov spoke at the rally and told attendants that Ukraine did not decline its goal of integrating to the EU: \\"We're allegedly betray Ukraine and sign [the agreement on joining] the Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia. I strongly deny these speculations\\".Azarov says rumors on Ukraine's joining Customs Union profiteering, Interfax-Ukraine (14 December 2013) He referred to statements that Ukrainian authorities where planning to join this Customs Union as \\"profiteering\\". Azarov also urged, \\"Don't divide Ukraine, don't build barricades\\".Ukraine suspends mayor, security official over protest crackdown, Zee News (14 December 2013) Azarov also said the EU had insisted on 'unacceptable conditions' sign the AA, including the introduction of gay marriage and laws protecting sexual minorities. \\"The opposition leaders are telling fables when they say that we only have to sign the [association] agreement [with the EU] to start traveling to Europe visa-free the next day. Nothing of the sort. We have yet to comply with a whole set of preconditions: we have to legalise same-sex marriages, we have to adopt legislation on equality of sexual minorities, and so on. Is our society ready for this?\\" Azarov said. Azarov has subsequently decamped to Vienna, where he maintains a palatial home. At the event, Party of Regions MP Hryhoriy Smitiukh called attendees to appeal to Russian president Vladimir Putin to lower the price of gas in Ukraine, and engaged the crowd in a chant of \\"Putin! Putin!\\" Organisers claimed over 100,000 attended; police estimated 60,000 attended, which was also estimated to be the maximum capacity of the square; eyewitnesses placed the attendance as low as 20,000. At 6:00 p.m. Party of Regions head Oleksandr Efremov announced the end of the meeting, a day earlier than planned. By the end of the rally, only 3,000 remained, and by the evening European Square was deserted. The rally on 15 December ran from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., and there were various reports that attendees were not paid in full for their time. \\"People came to express their will. We paid them Hr 300 per day. I did not promise any money to them, I am here with my voters,\\" said Artur Martovytskiy, a lawmaker from the Party of Regions. =January 2014 rally in Mariinsky park= Another rally by supporters of the Party of Regions began on 13 January 2014 and continued until the adoption of the state budget for 2014 on 17 January.Government supporters again rallying near parliament, this time against 'coup', Interfax-Ukraine (21 January 2014) According to the organisers people are attending the rally because they want \\"stability in the country\\" and believe that it is unacceptable to hinder the adoption of the state budget. Protesters are planning to spend the night in the tent city in Mariinsky park. According to the organisers participants in the rally were collecting signatures that will be sent to the Kyiv city council with the request to free the center of Kyiv of demonstrators, including Khreshchatyk and Maidan Nezalezhnosti. The organisers stated that the protesters were in favour of a peaceful solution to this issue and were against the violent dispersal of the pro-European rally. Interfax-Ukraine reported on 13 January that about ten tents had been set up in the park and metal shields had been installed perpendicular to Hrushevskoho Street, with law enforcement officers standing behind them.Party of Regions supporters begin rally near parliament, planning to stay until adoption of budget, Interfax-Ukraine (13 January 2014) Prime Minister Azarov criticised Euromaidan coverage in western media, and lack of attention to the 'anti-Maidan', \\"The Western media are paying attention to one square and do not pay for another,\\" and said that the anti-maidan represents all of Ukraine, whereas Euromaidan as a whole only represents Lviv, Ternopil, and Ivano-Frankivsk. He then stated that the majority of Ukraine supports the president, the government, and no longer has interest in European integration. Another rally by supporters of the Party of Regions (planned to bring up to 10,000 attendees) in Mariinsky park began on 21 January 2014 against an alleged attempted \\"coup\\" by the Euromaidan protesters. It is planned to continue until the end of the 2014 Hrushevskoho Street riots. Other antimaidans The Communist Party of Ukraine planned to gather 2,000 supporters to a 24 November 2013 rally against signing agreements with the European Union. Communists who attended set up tents near the statue of Lenin in Kyiv, intending to protect it from vandalism. On 25 November in Sevastopol the Russian Bloc and the Communist Party of Ukraine organised an \\"antimaidan\\". The meeting was conducted in support of joining the Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia. Previous rallies by the Russian Bloc in the weeks prior included EU flag burning and anti-government, and anti-Ukrainian rhetoric, On 26 November, another antimaidan protest was organised in Donetsk, attracting only 30 student protesters. Organisers stated that the European Union had ruined the economies of new members, and that joining would bring corruption and gay marriage. The protest was counter to the pro-EU EuroMaidan protest 200 meters away, which attracted no more than 50 protesters. The next day, a small antimaidan rally was held by the Russian Bloc and Communists in Mykolaiv. At a 25 November rally in Luhansk, protesters were met with resistance from a group of Don Cossacks, who were against EU membership and referred to pro-EU protesters as fascists. A 1 December Communist rally in Donetsk gathered about 200 mostly elderly supporters who chanted: \\"The union of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus is inevitable\\".Donetsk view: Ukraine 'other half' resents Kiev protests, BBC News (3 December 2013) The following day, Communist Party of Ukraine MP Antonina Khromova made statements at the Donetsk regional council, approving the use of force to remove protesters in Kyiv, which was met with applause. She continued by saying that Ukraine does not need European values, namely, \\"same-sex marriage\\" and \\"African panhandlers\\". The Sevastopol city council, on the initiative of the Russian Bloc, opted to appeal to the President and the Government of Ukraine to reorient foreign policy towards Russia and its Customs Union. The Russian Bloc has also demanded the resignation of Minister of Education Dmytro Tabachnyk, for not preventing students from taking part in the Euromaidan protests. On 8 December, the \\"Russian Community of Sevastopol\\" organisation held a rally in support of Berkut anti-riot troops who made headlines for assaulting students and journalists in Kyiv the week prior. Leader of the group, Tatiana Ermakova, expressed outrage at the fact that, according to her, protesters provoked and attacked Berkut troops. \\"No country in the world would allow such lawlessness which, for the 17th day occurs on the Maidan,\\" she said. The official statement from Russian Community specifically thanked the anti-riot troops for 'protecting us from the fascists', and called the Euromaidan demonstrators \\"Nazis\\" and \\"Banderites\\". On 14 December the leaders of the Russian Bloc and Russian Unity met with the Consul General of Russia in Crimea, Vyacheslav Svitlychny, and declared the preparation of an antimaidan to demand the secession of Crimea from Ukraine. On 25 January, a pro-government antimaidan was held in Mykolayiv, with attendees largely described as mostly young men, athletic, and appearing to be titushky. The crowd of 400 spoke out against fascism and held signs promoting the unity of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. On 26 January, a rally took place against the Maidan movement in Simferopol, with 200 attending. Protesters accused journalists of killing people in Kyiv. 1,000 gathered in Donetsk, supported by local Regions supporters, communists, and neo-cossacks; clashes caused some injuries. On 1 February in Dnipropetrovsk, Communists held a rally in support of merging Ukraine with Russia and Belarus, and called for the imposition of curfews, the closing of banks, and the expulsion of foreigners. In January 2015, an Anti-Maidan movement in Russia said it was ready to use violence to stop anti-government and pro-democracy protesters. Criticism Several news outlets have investigated the claims to confirm that by and large, attendees at pro-government rallies did so for financial compensation and not for political reasons, and were not an organic response to the Euromaidan. \\"People stand at Euromaidan protesting against the violation of human rights in the state, and they are ready to make sacrifices,\\" said Oleksiy Haran, a political scientist at Kyiv Mohyla Academy in Kyiv. \\"People at Antimaidan stand for money only. The government uses these hirelings to provoke resistance. They won't be sacrificing anything.\\" However, 42 Antimaidan activists lost their lives in the 2014 Odessa fire.

The Independent Women's League placed seventh in the elections. It was the only women-only party to contest the 1990 election.  Founded in 1989  On 3 December 1989, the participants of a women's congress in East Berlin he Volksb√ºhne adopted the \\"Manifesto for an Autonomous Women's Movement\\". It was decided to form a political association in order to be able to participate in the Round Table, which was to meet for the first time on 7 December 1989. Ina Merkel and Walfriede Schmitt were appointed as representatives of the UFV. The UFV understood itself as an organizational reservoir of the autonomous women's movement of the GDR and thus goes back to older groups in the GDR, such as Women for peace and the beginnings of a women / lesbian movement. He also resigned himself to the nationwide regime-loyal women's organization, the Democratic Women's Alliance of Germany (DFD). On 17 February 1990 took place again at a congress in East Berlin the official establishment of the association. This second foundation was necessary to be able to compete in the upcoming elections. The spokespersons of the women's association were Ina Merkel and Tatjana B√∂hm. The association wanted to unite independent women's groups, women's initiatives, women's commissions and also the women's factions of the parties and mass organizations of the GDR. The UFV understood more as an umbrella organization, the autonomy of the individual women's organizations should be respected. The UFV called for the equal participation of women in all political and economic decisions. The interests of women in the situation of upheaval in the GDR should be taken into account and a worsening of the social situation of women prevented.  Elections 1990  At the 1990 East German general election on 18 March, the UFV entered into electoral alliance with the newly founded Green Party in the GDR, which holds 2.0% and eight seats won. Part of the joint election program was the drafting of a social charter for the two German states. After the People's Chamber elections, however, the association announced the electoral alliance, because the Green Party received after the election process all eight won mandates and refused, of which the UFV to cede. For the first All-German 1990 federal election on December 2, the Independent Women's Association went to Democracy Now, the Greens, the Initiative for Peace and Human Rights (IFM), the United Left and the New Forum Party-list proportional representation under the name \\"Alliance 90 / Green - Citizen Movements\\" (B90 / Gr).  Marginalization after reunification  The Independent Women's Association helped bring women's issues to the Unification Agenda, such as the more stringent reorganization of ¬ß 218, but quickly lost importance after reunification. At the end of September 1991, the 3rd Extraordinary Congress of the UFV in Weimar decided that the association should continue to work as a registered association in the future. This contributed to the political marginalization of the UFV. This club finally dissolved in the summer of 1998.

The event was the 18th event produced under the Rey de Reyes name and also the 18th time that the Rey de Reyes tournament was held. Production =Background= Starting in 1997 and every year since then the Mexican Lucha Libre, or professional wrestling, company Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA, or Triple A) has held a Rey de Reyes (Spanish for \\"King of Kings') show in the spring. The 1997 version was held in February, while all subsequent Rey de Reyes shows were held in March. As part of their annual Rey de Reyes event AAA holds the eponymious Rey de Reyes tournament to determine that specific year's Rey. Most years the show hosts both the qualifying round and the final match, but on occasion the qualifying matches have been held prior to the event as part of AAA's weekly television shows. The traditional format consists of four preliminary rounds, each a Four-man elimination match with each of the four winners face off in the tournament finals, again under elimination rules. There have been years where AAA has employed a different format to determine a winner. The winner of the Rey de Reyes tournament is given a large ornamental sword to symbolize their victory, but is normally not guaranteed any other rewards for winning the tournament, although some years becoming the Rey de Reyes has earned the winner a match for the AAA Mega Championship. From 1999 through 2009 AAA also held an annual Reina de Reinas (\\"Queen of Queens\\") tournament, but later turned that into an actual championship that could be defended at any point during the year, abandoning the annual tournament concept. The 2014 show was the 18th Rey de Reyes show in the series. =Storylines= The Rey de Reyes show featured seven professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

It was one of the smallest 17-year broods, consisting exclusively of the species Magicicada septendecim, and was historically restricted to areas of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island which appeared to be at the northern limit of the species' range.Cooley, J. et al \\"At the limits: habitat suitability modelling of northern 17-year periodical cicada extinctions\\", Global Ecology and Biogeography 22 (2013), 410-421, 419Cooley et al 2013, 411 Brood XI has not been seen since its 1954 emergence and is now generally regarded as extinct. Historical records Brood XI cicadas had historically been reported from scattered areas of the north-eastern United States, with records found going back into the 18th century, such as at Sandwich, Massachusetts. E. C. Herrick saw them \\"swarming\\" in the woods of Tolland County in 1835.Herrick, \\"Uprising of the Seventeen-year Cicada\\", American Journal of Science, 33, 434 By the late 19th century records were already becoming scarce. Entomologist George Dimmock recorded the species in great numbers in Suffield, Connecticut in 1869 and collected a specimen, but failed to find them in the same location when searching seventeen years later.Dow, \\"Is Brood XI Extinct?\\", Bulletin of the New England Museum of Natural History, 1929, 28 It was reported by Prof. A. S. Packard from three localities in Rhode Island in 1903, including at a site in the town of Coventry near the southwest end of the Tiogue Reservoir where they covered the scrub oak for an eighth of a mile,Packard, A. S. \\"Appearance of the 17-year cicada in Rhode Island in 1903\\", Psyche, 10 (1903), 219 but a search in 1920 drew a blank.Manter, J. A. \\"Magicicada septendecim Linn. Brood XI in Connecticut\\", Psyche 62 (1955), 157-158 By the 1920s the lack of reports led some to suggest that the brood had become extinct. 1937 emergence To the great interest of entomologists, Brood XI was rediscovered on its 1937 emergence by Prof. Jerauld Manter of the University of Connecticut, who was informed on June 7, 1937 that periodical cicadas had been seen near the town of Willington, Connecticut.The site was east of present-day Cowles Road, near the Willington town line (Cooley, 411) On visiting he found what appeared to be a \\"thriving colony\\" in pastureland to the east of the town on a farm belonging to a Mr. John Blahusiak.Manter, J. A. \\"The periodical cicada in Connecticut in 1937\\" in Britton (ed). Connecticut State Entomologist, Thirty- Seventh Report, 1938, 249 Manter noted references to cicadas being heard in the locality in 1903 and 1920, and observed the colony covering an area of about 10 acres, with \\"many thousands clinging to the trees\\". However, he added that given the absence of other reports the colony was probably \\"the last remnant\\" of Brood XI. 1954 emergence The final record of Brood XI cicadas was made, once again, by Manter, who revisited the site in 1954. Cicadas were observed from June 10, but it was noted that \\"at no time did their numbers approach those of 1937\\". A visit later in the summer found no evidence of egg laying or consequent wilting of twigs, unlike in 1937, leading to the conclusion that the cicadas were approaching extinction. A search conducted in 1971 at the same site revealed no individuals, and no records of Brood XI have appeared since.Manter, J. A. \\"Brood XI of the periodical cicada seems doomed\\" in Beard (ed) 25th Anniversary Memoirs of the Connecticut Entomological Society, (1974), 99-100 Habitat fragmentation and environmental pressures resulting from the area being at the edge of the species' range have been put forward as reasons for the brood's extinction. Recent history In 1988, an amateur entomologist believed they had seen a swarm of Brood XI on the outskirts of Chaplin, Connecticut, near the Natchaug State Forest. However, this report was later proven to be inaccurate. While still commonly believed to be extinct, David Marshall of the University of Connecticut has stated that he \\"would not be surprised if there are small patches of [Brood XI] that have been missed since much of southern New England is not that densely inhabited\\".http://www.cicadamania.com/cicadas/brood-xi-alive/ References Category:Cicadas Category:Fauna of the Eastern United States ","title":"Brood XI"},{"id":"42120343","text":"Sindernbach is a river of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, which is 3.58 kilometers in length.

During a House leadership crisis which began in late September 2020, Romero supported Lord Allan Velasco's speakership bid in accordance with the term- sharing agreement between Cayetano and Velasco during the commencement of the 18th Congress. On October 2, Fredenil Castro (Capiz‚Äì2nd) challenged the representatives to resign if they cannot cooperate with Cayetano's leadership. Deputy Majority Leader Xavier Jesus Romualdo moved to have Castro replace Romero as a deputy speaker. The motion was approved without objections, removing Romero from the position. On October 12, a majority of House members held session at the Celebrity Sports Complex in Quezon City. After they declared the speakership vacant, Romero was one of those who nominated Velasco as speaker. Velasco was declared as the new speaker after garnering 186 votes, more than the 151 needed for a majority. However, Cayetano's side questioned the legality of the session. The next day, Velasco was formally elected in an official session held at the Batasang Pambansa while Cayetano resigned. On October 14, Romero was again elected as a deputy speaker, replacing the ousted Luis Raymund Villafuerte (Camarines Sur‚Äì2nd), a Cayetano ally.

He was Professor of Astronomy at the University of Glasglow from 1803 to 1836. Life Rev. James Couper was Professor of Astronomy at the University of Glasgow from 1803 to 1836. He also held other positions within the University including; * Dean of Faculties 1800-1801; * Clerk of Senate from 1810-1814, 1820-1828; * keeper of the Hunterian Museum (a joint position with his sons). He taught very little Astronomy and abandoned observations because of the increasing smoke and new buildings in the surrounding areas of the observatory. He seemed not to have considered building a new observatory outside the town. Couper was a student at the University of Glasgow and graduated Master of Arts in 1775, and Doctor of Divinity in 1800. He became minister of Baldernock Parish Church in 1783 until his appointment to the Regius Chair of Astronomy in 1803. In November 1813 Couper took on responsibility for teaching Hebrew when the then Professor of Oriental Languages became ill. He is buried in Ramshorn Cemetery on Ingram Street in Glasgow. The grave lies on the western wall of the main eastern entrance, close to where the cemetery widens. Minister of Baldernock Parish Church Rev. James Couper became minister of Baldernock Parish Church, East Renfrewshire, in 1783. In 1795, the present Church building was constructed during his tenure.

Their debut EP, produced by Ben Grosse, Until We Meet Again, was released on March 11, 2014. After a series of delays, their debut fell-length album, Condition Critical, is scheduled for release on November 1, 2019. The first single, \\"Something\\", was released on August 1, 2017. thumb History =Formation and Until We Meet Again EP (2013-2014)= The project was first the idea of guitarist Chris Shy, the prior guitarist of band Aurora Sky. who envisioned doing a project with Pete Murray of Lo-Pro. He contacted Murray after the release of Lo-Pro's third album, Disintegration Effect, in June 2013. The two communicated vaguely about working together through email, which eventually led to sending song ideas back and forth. Upon completion of their first complete song, \\"Feed\\", the two decided a band should be started, and the two were tasked with forming a real band. Murray recruited John Fahnestock as a bass player, who he had worked with on Lo-Pro's first album, Lo-Pro prior to Fahnestock leaving during the six-year gap to their second album, The Beautiful Sounds of Revenge. Shy had always envisioned Will Hunt, prior drummer for Evanescence, Device and Dark New Day, as a member, and proceeded to recruit him for the project. The entire recruitment process had been done entirely over phone and internet; the band had not ever all been together in person until the start of the recording sessions. The band recorded their debut EP, Until We Meet Again, throughout the end of 2013 and early 2014, with music producer Ben Grosse, who had previously worked with Breaking Benjamin, Disturbed, and Filter. Grosse was chosen because Murray had desired to work with him since the recording of Lo-Pro's debut album, due to his involvement in producing Title of Record. The album was recorded in East West Studios. A minute long teaser clip was released in December 2013, with the band shooting for a \\"Spring 2014\\" release timeframe. The release date for Until We Meet Again was later narrowed down to March 11, 2014. A promotional single, \\"Feed\\", was released a week prior to the album's release on March 5, while the band's first single, \\"End Over End\\", was released shortly afterwards.http://newnoisemagazine.com/white-noise-owls-until-meet- again/http://rockyourlyrics.com/until-we-meet-again-white-noise-owl-interview- with-pete- murray/http://www.antimusic.com/news/17/August/02Supergroup_White_Noise_Owl_Release_Something_Video.shtml =Condition Critical (2015-present)= Shortly after the release of Until We Meet Again, Murray announced that the band would continue working on new music, leading up to a release of a full-length album.

Siegel, 571 U.S. ___ (2014), is a ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States that describes the extent of the powers of bankruptcy courts in dealing with the bad faith of debtors. Background When Law filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2004, his sole asset was a home in Hacienda Heights, California that was said to be worth $363,000. He declared that: :* there was a first mortgage lien (deed of trust) of $150,000 owing to a bank, and a second for $168,000 owing to \\"Lin‚Äôs Mortgage & Associates\\" :* there were three judgment liens also registered against the property :* as the value of the two mortgage liens, together with California's homestead exemption of $75,000, was greater than the value of the house, there was nothing available for distribution to Law's general creditors. It was discovered in subsequent litigation that the second mortgage lien did not exist. The house sold for about $680,000, and only one creditor timely filed a proof of claim which was settled for $120,000. The trustee sought to surcharge the homestead exemption in order to be reimbursed for his legal expenses in the matter. The courts below The United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California, in accordance with existing jurisprudence within the Ninth Circuit, ordered that Law's homestead must be surcharged in its entirety. This was affirmed by the Bankruptcy Appeals Panel, and subsequently by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. At the Supreme Court The Ninth Circuit ruling was reversed. In a unanimous ruling, Justice Scalia noted that:USSC, at II.A. :* grants a bankruptcy court authority to \\"issue any order, process, or judgment that is necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of\\" the Bankruptcy Code, :* the court also has inherent power to sanction abusive litigation practice,Marrama v. Citizens Bank of Massachusetts, but :* a bankruptcy court may not contravene specific statutory provisions. As expressly states that a homestead exemption is \\"not liable for payment of any administrative expense,\\" the court exceeded the limits of its authority under ¬ß105(a) and its inherent powers. The Court's ruling in Marrama would not have led to a different result, as its dictum only \\"suggests that in some circumstances a bankruptcy court may be authorized to dispense with futile procedural niceties in order to reach more expeditiously an end result required by the Code.\\"USSC, at II.C. The bankruptcy court still has various sanctions available to enforce its judgments:USSC, at II.D. :* outlines circumstances where the court can deny a discharge from bankruptcy :* Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure ¬ß authorizes the court to impose sanctions for bad-faith litigation conduct :* it may also possess further sanctioning authority under either or its inherent powersChambers v. NASCO, Inc., :* provides that a bankruptcy court's monetary sanction survives the bankruptcy case and is thereafter enforceable through the normal procedures for collecting money judgments :* Fraudulent conduct in a bankruptcy case may also subject a debtor to criminal prosecution under , which carries a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment Justice Scalia acknowledged the seeming unfairness of the result: Impact The decision is described as \\"brisk and workmanlike,\\" and \\"[t]he absence of qualifications or quibbles in its description of the relevant principles make it just the kind of opinion that is likely to be cited frequently in future briefs to the Court.\\" Law is also seen as forcing trustees and creditors to be more aggressive, early in the case, either to object to exemptions or file a motion to extend the time to object to exemptions in order to provide enough time for investigation. Justice Scalia did not note another sanction that is available under FRBP ¬ß which provides that a trustee may still file an objection to a debtor‚Äôs claim of exemption \\"at any time prior to one year after the closing of the case, if the debtor fraudulently asserted the claim of exemption.\\" However, this provision only came into effect in 2008, and therefore was not applicable in this case. While equitable subordination is authorized under as a remedy to ensure that creditors acting in bad faith will not be paid until other valid creditors are paid in full, the Bankruptcy Code does not explicitly provide for a similar \\"equitable disallowance\\" remedy with respect to debtors acting in bad faith. Although several of the lower courts had previously ruled in favour of such a remedy, it appears that Law strongly supports the conclusion that equitable disallowance does not exist under the Code. Law, together with Stern v. Marshall, can also be seen as another limitation on the bankruptcy courts‚Äô inherent authority under ¬ß105, thereby reducing the courts' flexibility and discretion that are necessary for the proper functioning of the bankruptcy system.

Life According to The Martyrology of Donegal Luchtigern's mother was Brigh, daughter of Forannan, son of Conall, son of Tochtan, son of Amhalgaidh, sister of Maelaithghin. He was a disciple of Saint Ruadh√°n of Lorrha. He appears to be a different person from Luchern or Luctigern, a disciple of Saint Comgall at Bangor. Luchtigern presided over the abbey of Ennistymon, which has since disappeared without trace. An old ruined church in the Ennistymon burial ground, although more recent, most likely marks the location of the abbey. Luchtigern resigned the apostleship of Ennistymon to Saint Mainch√≠n. Luchtigern was also connected with Corcomroe Abbey, and seems to have had authority over all of Thomond or North Munster. Luchtigern is mentioned in the life of Saint Mac Creiche, who died in 541. At this time Luchtigern was connected with Ennistymon and Corcomroe. He accompanied MacCreiche to Carn Mic T√°il to give advice to the Corca Modruadh and Tuadhmhumhain people over a tribute of cattle that the king of Connaught was demanding. Luchtigern's main church would have been at Tuam Fionnlocha in the barony of Upper Bunratty. Tuamfinlough is the oldest known settlement in the region of Newmarket-on-Fergus. He is commemorated in the Feast of St. Luchtigern on 29 April, the date when he became abbot of Tuam Fionnlocha. Legends =Visit to Saint √çte= Luchtigern was one of the friends of Saint √çte, a contemporary of Saint Brigid of Kildare. It is recorded that Luchtigern and Saint Laisren were travelling to visit √çte with a young monk, who called them \\"stupid and foolish\\" to visit the old hag. The abbots reproved the monk, suspecting that √çte would have heard his words. Their fears were justified. √çte greeted them by asking why they had come to visit an old hag. The young monk was forced to do penance before the visit could proceed. =Plague stone = A traditional story tells of Luchtigern curing a woman inflicted by the plague, who came to him when he was working in the field at Tomfinlough with two deacons. One of the deacons was greatly impressed, and attributed the cure to God working through the saint. The other was skeptical. Luchtigern carved three faces on a stone, representing himself and the deacons, and said that heaven would show who was right. Soon the face of the skeptic was worn away, while the other two faces remained. The \\"plague stone\\" with its three bosses, one flat and two round, is part of the Tomfinlough graveyard wall, and may be seen today.

Stolberg Zinc is the latest offshoot of a long line of metallurgical enterprises in Stolberg. It originated in 1938 with a name change from the Company for Mining, Lead and Zinc Production at Stolberg (French: Soci√©t√© anonyme des mines et des fonderies de zinc de Stolberg) - Stolberger Gesellschaft (Stolberg Company) for short. Besides the Nievenheim zinc smelter at Dormagen there was their main zinc operation, the M√ºnsterbusch zinc smelter, which was in operation until 1967, and the Binsfeldhammer lead smelter, which was acquired in 1970 by the Berzelius Duisburg company. Since then, it is primarily engaged in the management of properties, such as the sale of commercial space on the recultivated slag dump at Kohlbusch. A subsidiary company was Silber- und Bleibergwerksgesellschaft AG zu Holzappel, in Laurenburg, Rhineland-Palatinate, as well as Gewerkschaft Mercur with headquarters in Bad Ems. Starting in the 1950s until 1968, Stolberg Zinc operated the open pit at Maubacher Bleiberg. In addition it held, respectively, mine properties or mine property shares in Bulgaria (Bergwerk-AG Pirin: Pirin Mine Company), Spain and Italy. In 1957, the Adolph-Helene pit in Altlay was leased, which, however, had to close only two years later.  Stolberger Gesellschaft and Metallurgische Gesellschaft zu Stolberg  =1800s= In 1838. the Metallurgische Gesellschaft zu Stolberg (Metallurgical Company at Stolberg) was founded as a joint-stock company of merchants and mine owners. Its chief investor was James Crocker. It was the first of a long line of metallurgical enterprises in Stolberg that combined the mine properties and metal smelting. Also involved were, among others, Cockerill's brother John as well as Barthold Suermondt from Aachen, Friedrich Thyssen, manager of the Eschweiler wire factory, as well as Salomon Oppenheim, the Cologne banking firm. Part of their corporate assets were the St. Heinrich Munsterbusch zinc smelter, the Herrenberg calamine mines, 49/64 shares in the Diepenlinchen lead and zinc mines as well as minor interests in the lead and zinc mines at Breinegerberg and B√ºsbacherberg. In 1840, the James Mine was taken over by the Metallurgischen Gesellschaft. In 1841, the Metallurgische Gesellschaft leased all operating facilities to the Marquis de Sassenay, and was converted to the Kammanditgesellschaft de Sassenay & Cie. in die Stolberger Gesellschaft (de Sassenay & Co. Limited Partnership in the Stolberg Company). In 1845, through a conversion of the business organization after the adoption of the Prussian Securities Act of 1843, there arose in turn, from that Kommanditgesellschaft de Sassenay & Cie., the Gesellschaft f√ºr Bergbau, Blei- und Zinkfabrikation zu Stolberg (Company for Mining, Lead and Zinc Production at Stolberg; French: Soci√©t√© anonyme des mines et des fonderies de zinc de Stolberg), Stolberger Gesellschaft for short. In 1848, from the joint stock company at Bleyberg es Muntzen the Stolberger Gesellschaft acquired the M√ºnsterbusch lead and silver works, founded two years before, which operated until 1916, at what is now Schellerweg across from the Zinkh√ºtter Hof. As both of its predecessors had done, the Stolberger Gesellschaft covered its need for zinc and lead ore exclusively from the Stolberg deposits, especially from the Diepenlinchen ore mine. The 1853 merger with the Rheinisch-Westf√§lischen Bergwerksverein brought access to the rich lead and zinc deposits at Ramsbecker, and a name change to Gesellschaft f√ºr Bergbau und Zinkfabrikation zu Stolberg und in Westfalen (Mining and Zinc Production Company at Stolberg and Westphalia). In 1855, William von der Heydt of the Elberfelder banking family superseded the Marquis de Sassenay as the General Manager, and was able to overcome a business crisis. The Stolberg Company took over the B√ºsbacherberg-Brockenberg ore mine from the bankruptcy assets of the alliance. =1900s= In 1909 the Stolberger Company also acquired the Emser Blei- und Silberwerk AG (Emser Lead and Silver Plant, AG) In 1922, a joint operation was formed with the Eschweiler company, which then led to the merger with the Stolberger Gesellschaft in 1926. By the merger, the Gute Hoffnung Mine near Sankt Goarshausen came into the possession of the company. By 1950 the Stolberg Company controlled the \\"Ernst\\" mine at Wiesloch for the production of zinc. By the end of World War II, several mines including Wiesloch were flooded.

Thomas Smith Jr. It is an encyclopedic work on the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the only independent agency of the United States federal government that is tasked with intelligence-gathering. The work chronicles the history of the agency from its founding in 1947 through the war on terror, which began after September 11 attacks. The encyclopedia's chronology ends in 2003. It provides approximately 550 entries across 282 pages on topics including notable contributors, intelligence operations, historical events, and depictions of the CIA in fictional media. The encyclopedia was praised by the School Library Journal for its reference value and comprehensiveness. Booklist recommended the encyclopedia be placed in academic, public, and high school libraries as a helpful resource. Publishers Weekly was critical of the author's objectivity, suggesting that the encyclopedia was biased in favor of the agency's intelligence operations, but concluded that the book was still a useful reference tool. Background Encyclopedia of the Central Intelligence Agency is written by W. Thomas Smith Jr. Prior to authoring the work, he served in the United States Marine Corps as a paratrooper and leader within the infantry. Smith worked as a journalist for the Star-Reporter in Columbia, South Carolina, and subsequently taught journalism at the University of South Carolina. Smith gave an interview to the Columbia newspaper The State about his book and his interest in researching the history of the Central Intelligence Agency. He explained that he was long interested in researching military history, and was initially asked by the American Society of Journalists and Authors to put together a monograph on the 1944 Invasion of Normandy by Western Allied forces during Operation Overlord in World War II. His literary representative later telephoned him to ask if he would instead be interested in writing an encyclopedia detailing the history of the CIA. Smith agreed as he felt the CIA was highly relevant to military history. Publication history Encyclopedia of the Central Intelligence Agency was first published in 2003 by Facts on File. It was released in both hardcover and paperback formats. An eBook edition was published the same year. Additionally an eBook was also published in 2003 in Great Britain. Contents summary In the Encyclopedia of the Central Intelligence Agency, Smith discusses and defines key concepts relating to intelligence gathering, including \\"clandestine mentality\\", a colloquial term used to characterize what may be called a more paranoid perspective of the world. The book is 282 pages in length, and contains more than 500 separate entries on topics such as the roles played by key contributors to the agency, notable historical events, major intelligence operations, and depictions of the organization in fictional media. The work cites approximately 300 reference sources. Starting with the founding of the CIA in 1947 as the successor to the Office of Strategic Services, the author provides the reader with a chronological overview of the agency's history. He documents the CIA's involvement in the 1953 Iranian coup d'√©tat, and provides a biographical assessment of the motivations of Mohammad Mosaddegh, the Iranian leader deposed in the coup. In briefly describing individuals, organizations and events related to the history of the CIA, Smith notes Russian intelligence Colonel Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher (Rudolf Ivanovich Abel), and discusses the U.S. intelligence operation that used a front company called Zenith Technical Enterprises. The chronological presentation of CIA history is used to provide additional background with regard to the agency's involvement with the war on terror. The encyclopedia's chronology ends in March 2003. Reception In a review by School Library Journal, Smith's encyclopedia was praised for its reference value. The review called the encyclopedia comprehensive, and noted it contained helpful appendices including a glossary, lists of executive staff members of the CIA, and a large bibliography and index. Booklist commented in its review that the encyclopedia was a good resource to have in libraries at the academic, public, and high school levels. Publishers Weekly reviewed the encyclopedia and criticized Smith's objectivity, suggesting that he took an unabashedly positive view of the agency's role and focused exclusively on its operational successes. Despite the issue with bias, the review concluded that the book was still a useful reference work.

Born in Burns, Wyoming, she earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in music from the University of Wyoming in 1945 and a Master of Arts degree in music from the University of New Mexico in 1961. At Wyoming, she studied composition privately with Darius Milhaud and Roy Harris. She also studied music at a number of institutions in the United States and Europe, including the Juilliard and the Lausanne Conservatory in Switzerland. In 1956, after suffering from cancer for 8 years, Regina left Allan, and soon thereafter, they divorced. But they remained in close contact until she died in 1965, after 17 years of cancer. Regina composed several classical pieces between the 1930s and 1960s, including: Orchestral works * \\"Design for Orchestra I\\" (1948) * \\"Design for Orchestra II\\" (1953); Ballets * \\"Steel Mill\\" (1941) * \\"The Legend of the Willow Plate\\" (1949) :: \\"Doves\\" (finale); Regina was twice a resident composer at the Wurlitzer Foundation in Taos, New Mexico‚Äîfrom 1956 to 1957 and from 1960 to 1961.

Life Curt Echtermeyer was born in Valpara√≠so, Chile, in 1896 as the son of an immigrant who soon returned to Germany, and his Chilean wife. Curt and his sister grew up in Berlin, where he attended art school from 1914. He lived in Paris in 1925/26, taking up contact with other surrealist artists. The painter was \\"overlooked\\" for conscription in the First World War and spared service at the front in the Second World War.R√ºdiger Preisler. (See Bibliography.) Yet it was the Nazi dictatorship which forced him to develop a fundamentally different second style, and the Stalinist dictatorship in the GDR which prompted him to leave Berlin.R√ºdiger Preisler. (See Bibliography.) In 1962, after the erection of the Berlin Wall, Curt Echtermeyer took up residence in the Old Town of Bamberg, a picturesque Catholic city. At the end of 1969, Curt Echtermeyer and his wife moved to his beloved Spain. From his cottage in the village of San Vicente de Calders (Province of Tarragona), he could see the Mediterranean Sea. On 11 December 1971, Curt and Wally Echtermeyer fell victim to a tragic accident; they were interred at El Vendrell. This proponent of Modernism pursued an artistic double life ‚Äì under the name of Curt Bruckner ‚Äì by providing highly popular canvases in the style of 19th century Realism. As Echtermeyer, the artist often created vast, dark, dreamlike, unsettling scenes, while as Bruckner, he produced intimate, warm, quotidian, idyllic images. Echtermeyer categorically rejected preparatory studies, drawing directly onto the canvas or wood before applying oil or pastel, and preferred to paint by night. Many oil paintings of his Paris period are relatively small and executed directly on wood, as he lived in various, narrow, lodgings and sometimes used parts of the furniture, for instance the bottom of drawers.R√ºdiger Preisler. (See Bibliography.) Curt Echtermeyer was related to the writer Ernst Theodor Echtermeyer and the sculptor Carl Friedrich Echtermeier, formerly Echtermeyer. The latter changed his name in 1905, possibly to confirm the break with his eldest son Romolus, Curt‚Äôs father. Work =Work as Curt Echtermeyer= Echtermeyer‚Äôs early work is generally sombre and surreal, populated by pale figures with mask-like faces. Black, grey, brown and dark shades, often punctuated by white or blood- red, prevail in many scenes, while others shine in rainbow colours. Later, the palette and mood of his paintings lightened, and some approached abstraction, while still teeming with people. His impressions of traditional festivities in Bamberg are reminiscent of fireworks; so is his pastel The Feast of Life from his last years in Spain. Selection of works signed as Echtermeyer: *Selbstbildnis (Self-Portrait) (1916) *Caf√© Boheme Berlin (1922) *Urwald (Jungle) (1924) *Mondg√∂ttin (Moon Goddess) (ca. 1925) *Tanzender Tod (Dancing Death) (ca. 1925) *Tomaten (Tomatoes) (1927) *Legende (Legend) (1929) *Selbstbildnis (Self-Portrait) (ca. 1938) *Selbstbildnis (Self-Portrait) (1946/47) *Bildnis eines T√§nzers (Portrait of a Dancer) *Zirkus ‚Äì buntes Treiben in der Arena (Circus) *Madame Zebra (1948) *Prozession in Bamberg I-III, Sandkerwa in Bamberg (1963) *Das Fest des Lebens (The Feast of Life) (1970) =Work as Curt Bruckner= Curt Echtermeyer was prompted to turn to interiors by the changed political circumstances in the thirties. After the war, his dexterity earned him a regular and comfortable income with Berlin art dealer Werner Karst, who established a production line of popular and affordable genre scenes for German homes. Amongst a flood of mainly German landscapes, Curt Bruckner seems to have been one of the few suppliers of figurative motives, billed as ‚Äúspecialist in Old Masters‚Äù. His genre views often depict comfortable middle-class men in the pursuit of their trades or hobbies, for example making or playing musical instruments. Many of these are set in the past ‚Äì either the nineteenth century, whose artistic style they emulate, or those preceding. The genre scenes are dominated by a warm golden brown, contrasting with the melancholy ashen tones of Echtermeyer's surrealist and expressionist imagery. The historical interiors are crammed with books, globes, plans, models and framed paintings. The virtuoso artist sometimes playfully signed a picture in the picture with \\"C. Bruckner pinx.\\".See details of The Philatelist (1961)See details of The Great Architect (1962)  Bibliography  * Curt Echtermeyer, 1896 bis 1971 : √ñlbilder und Pastelle.

Sneesby uses a sit-ski in competitions. Personal history Sneesby was born on 26 June 1994 in High Wycombe. At the age of three months he was diagnosed with neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer. He underwent a course of chemotherapy and several operations, which resulted in the successful treatment of the tumour, but left him with no sensation in his left leg, and only partial feeling in his right leg. Sneesby attended school at Claires Court School in Maidenhead and John Hampden Grammar School in High Wycombe, but on achieving his A-Levels, decided to defer his degree course to focus on his skiing. He is now studying LLB Law at the University of Leeds. Sports career Sneesby began skiing at the age of 11 at adaptive sessions on a dry ski slope in High Wycombe. At the age of 13 he was spotted by the British Disabled Ski Team (BDST) and was offered a place as one of the first members of the BDST youth development squad. As well as showing promise as a skier, Sneesby also showed a talent for wheelchair basketball playing for the MK Aces and captaining the England South Wheelchair Basketball team at the 2013 National School Games. Sneesby decided to focus fully on his skiing and in his first full competitive season in 2010 he recorded four top ten finishes across his events which qualified him to race at Europa Cup level in all five events, including his favoured Super G, Super Combination and Downhill. In early 2014 it was announced that he had qualified for the Great Britain team that would be competing at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Russia; competing in the sit-ski events. This was his debut Paralympics. In January 2018 Sneesby was selected for the Great Britain Development Team for Wheelchair Tennis.

She was allowed to sit in the cockpit of a plane flying her home after a trip away from Denver. Warner said, ‚ÄúThe pilot could see how excited I was and he encouraged me to take flying lessons. I replied: ‚ÄòCan girls do that?‚Äô‚Äù She started flying in 1958, after getting the approval of her parents for lessons. The lessons cost thirteen dollars per week at a time that she had a thirty-eight dollar per week paycheck. She sometimes worked fourteen hours a day, with a morning flight, a full-time office job, and an evening flight. She obtained her private pilot license and a job as a flying traffic reporter within a year.  Clinton Aviation years  Two Convair 580s (here belonging to Aspen Airways) at Stapleton Airport in 1986. This is one of the models of aircraft Emily Howell Warner began flying at Clinton Aviation. She took a job as a receptionist for Clinton Aviation Company in Denver, Colorado to pay for her instruction. She worked there as a flight instructor after obtaining additional certificates as a commercial pilot and flight instructor, and instrument and multiengine ratings. She worked extra maintenance flights, such as delivering airplane parts or planes, in order to build her hours. She also flew with a reporter to provide traffic reports. From 1945 to 1968, Clinton Aviation Company operated at Stapleton Airport and was the first company in the US to sell Cessna airplanes. It was founded by Lou Clinton and Grant Robertson. Warner initially flew for Clinton Aviation as a first officer on Convair 580s and de Havilland Twin Otters. In 1966, United Air Lines contracted a test pilot program with Clinton Aviation, and Emily served as one of three flight instructors for the program. She was later promoted to flight school manager and chief pilot. She became the first woman to be appointed a designated FAA Pilot Examiner. In 1968, she began applying for a position at Frontier Airlines as well as Continental Airlines and United Airlines. Lou Clinton wrote letters recommending her. She would renew her applications multiple times over a five-year period. In late 1972, a fellow flight instructor said he was hired by Frontier Airlines, strengthening Warner's resolve. At this point, Warner had been active in the aviation industry for more than twelve years. She had accrued more than 3,500 flight hours as a pilot and 7,000 hours as a flight instructor. Students she had trained were being hired with 1,500 to 2,000 hours of flying time. A friend who worked with Frontier introduced her to the vice president of flight operations there and Warner persisted in canvassing Frontier for a position.  Frontier Airlines and aviation firsts  Warner flew Boeing 737-200s for Frontier Airlines such as the one pictured here The flight deck of a Boeing 737-200. On January 29, 1973, Frontier Airlines hired her. It was fifteen years after her first plane flight. This marked an opening for American women in one of the last sex-segregated occupations in the civilian aviation industry. When Warner was hired there were no other women working as pilots for the major commercial airlines. By 1978, there were about 300 female commercial pilots in the United States. On February 6, 1973, Howell Warner served for the first time as second officer on a Frontier Airlines Boeing 737. The flight departed from Denver's Stapleton Airport for Las Vegas. Within six months, she was promoted to first officer. In 1974, she became the first woman member of the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA). Three years later she became the first woman to earn her captain's wings. In 1976, she became the first woman US airline captain, flying a Twin Otter. Howell Warner continued to fly with Frontier until 1986. Warner stayed on when People Express purchased Frontier and then itself was purchased by Continental Airlines. After a short time flying for Continental Airlines, she left to become captain of a Boeing 727 for UPS Airlines. She also flew a DC-8 for United Parcel Service. In 1986, she commanded an all-female flight crew. Warner flew DC-8s for UPS Airlines In 1990, she left UPS Airlines to become a Federal Aviation Administration examiner. She was the FAA Aircrew Program Manager, assigned to United Airlines' Boeing 737 Fleet.

Life  Johannes Gerhard Kratzat was born in 1909 in Burg (Dithmarschen). He attended the public school and its senior division, then studied with Burg's savings bank and picked up the seaman's profession. In Burg he was called the learned sailor. In the fall of 1931, he participated in the seaman's strike in the Baltic ports. From March to July, 1933, he was detained in the Sonnenburg concentration camp and tortured. So for weeks he could only take liquid food because his jaw had been dislocated by brutal blows. Only when he was already completely weakened was the case addressed by a doctor. After his release, he stayed for a long time with his parents in Burg. From 1934 to 1936 Kratzat worked for the International of Seamen and Harbour Workers (ISH) in Rotterdam and Antwerp. In the local International clubs (\\"Inter-clubs\\"), German sailors were supplied with illegal papers and questioned concerning the events in the German Reich and on the ships. From 1937 to 1939 he held senior positions during the Spanish Civil War with the intelligence services operations for the maritime group of the Communist Party. Among other things, he was substantially involved in the repatriation of members of the English-speaking Abraham Lincoln Brigade. In World War II he joined the Resistance in France. On March 10, 1944, he was arrested in Paris by the Germans, sentenced to death for \\"giving aid to the enemy\\" by a German court martial, and executed on July 12, 1944 in Lyon.  Remembrance  The stumbling block for Gerhard Kratzat in Garden Street in Burg (Dithmarschen) On July 30, 2009, Gunter Demnig had a Stolperstein (stumbling block) laid in Gartenstra√üe 15, to the memory of Gerhard Kratzat.

He has exhibited his work in Mexico, the United States and Spain and has been commissioned to make furniture and other items for three popes. He works in Tlaquepaque, Jalisco where he owns two shops. Life Parra Echauri was born in Tepic, Nayarit, the eighth of ten children born to Jos√© Parra Villalpando, a sculptor trained at the Academy of San Carlos, and Mar√≠a del Refugio Partida Echauri. When he was a child, he frequently visited the Tepic Cathedral, located near his school and admired the artwork. When he was ten, people began to pay him to draw Christmas cards. He moved to Guadalajara when he was twelve. He studied high school for two years at the Master Cultural Caba√±as Bribiesca, then received his bachelors in business administration from the University of Guadalajara. Today he lives and works in Tlaquepaque, Jalisco, where he owns two shops, one dedicated to his own work. Career Parra Echauri has had a career of over 35 years, founding his own business in 1985 specifically to create colonial era style artwork, as well as frames, tables, benches and cabinets. He sells his work to hotels, restaurants, haciendas and decoration centers. The artist has held exhibitions in Mexico, Spain and the United States including the Expo Muebla Guadalajara (1998, 1999), the International Home Furnishing Market in High Point, NC (1991-1999), Exposici√≥n Mueble in Monterrey (1989), the Feria Internacional de Seville, Spain (1992), the Feria del Mueble, Valencia, Spain (1992), the Feria del Muebla y Decoraci√≥n (2003) and the Expo Galer√≠a Nacional in Costa Rica (2005) . In 1999 he was commissioned to m a papal chair along with 35 other pieces for the visit of John Paul II, and created more works for this pope's return visit in 2002. In 2012 he created the furniture for the visit of Pope Benedict XVI. In 2007, to mark the fifteenth anniversary of diplomatic relations between Mexico and the Vatican, he was commissioned to create a nativity scene and other Christmas decorations. A replica of the nativity scene was created to be exhibited in Guadalajara. He has also created pieces for the San Fernando Cathedral and the Mission San Jos√© in San Antonio, Texas. A towering altarpiece of his was featured when the latter was reopened in 2011. His work has received various recognitions. In 1998 he was recognized by the Ocho Columnas de Oro newspaper for his efforts to revive colonial era art. The government of the state of Jalisco has named him a \\"distinguished craftsman\\" and the Fomento Cultural Banamex named him a \\"grand master.\\" In 2004, a book about him called Agust√≠n Parra:barroco mexicnao was published by Amaroma Ediciones. Artistry Parra Echauri is a self-taught painter, sculptor, designer, altarpiece and furniture maker and is credited with reviving interest in Mexican colonial art. He prefers commissions for religious art in colonial style, valuing their realism and drama, with lifelike veins and skin textures, poses in motion and faces with feeling. The artist says that \\"it moves his heart\\" to see how paint can wear off of images of Christ because worshippers tap and rub the images' hands, feet and knees. All pieces are made individually, and he tries to maintain as many of the colonial era methods as possible, many from the 17th century, but some as old as 14th century Italy. He mixes paint to order, cures wood for carving, (preferring Montezuma Cypress (Taxodium mucronatum), Mexican white pine (Pinus ayacahuite), walnut, cedar and orange woods) and works with materials such as dirt, egg yolks, red clay and a type of glue made from rabbit collagen. Although there are modern substitutions for these, he believes that the old methods and ingredients are why colonial artwork has lasted so long. For example, he is an expert in estofado, or the covering of wooden sculptures, usually religious images, in plaster before decorating them with gold leaf and/or paint.

After winning one of his four starts as a two-year-old in 1997, he improved to become one of the best milers and the highest-rated horse of his generation in Europe in the following year. He won the European Free Handicap in April before winning three Group One races in three countries: the Irish 2,000 Guineas in Ireland, the Prix du Moulin in France and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in the United Kingdom. After a disappointing run in the Breeders' Cup Turf he was retired to stud and has had some success as a sire of winners. Background Desert Prince is a bay horse with white socks on his hind feet bred in Ireland by Tarworth Bloodstock, a breeding company owned by the Jersey-based businessman Peter Pritchard. He was sired by Green Desert, a horse who finished second to Dancing Brave in the 1986 2000 Guineas before winning the July Cup and the Haydock Sprint Cup. At stud, his other winners included Oasis Dream, Sheikh Albadou and Cape Cross. Desert Prince's dam, Flying Fairy, failed to win a race but came from a good family, being a daughter of the 1000 Guineas winner Fairy Footsteps. In October 1996, the yearling colt was sent from Pritchard's Genesis Green Stud to the Tattersalls sale at Newmarket, Suffolk, where he was bought for 62,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent Charlie Gordon-Watson acting on behalf of Edward St Georges's Lucayan Stud. Gordon-Watson later recalled: \\"At the sales, Desert Prince stood out because he was just a great athletic horse. He had a good pedigree with Fairy Footsteps and Light Cavalry in there on the dam's side. On pedigree, I thought he had a chance of producing the goods. David Loder and I knew Desert Prince was going to make more than St George was prepared to pay. We managed to track him down in London, where he was having lunch. We told him the horse was definitely worth having. He gave us the OK and he's the most expensive horse St George has ever bought\\". The colt was sent into training with Loder at Nemarket. Racing career =1997: two- year-old season= Desert Prince began his racing career in a six furlong maiden race at Doncaster Racecourse on 24 May. Ridden by Kevin Darley he started the 2/5 favourite in a thirteen-runner field and took the lead in the closing stages to win by half a length from Hayil, a colt who went on to win the Group One Middle Park Stakes that October. In June the colt was moved up in class for the Group Two Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot in which he was ridden for the first time by Olivier Peslier. Starting the 3/1 favourite he was among the leaders from the start but was beaten one and a half lengths by the Aidan O'Brien-trained Harbour Master. Kieren Fallon became the third jockey to ride Desert Prince when the colt was sent to France to contest the Group One Prix Morny over 1200 metres at Deauville Racecourse on 24 August. Racing against some of the best French juveniles, he finished fifth behind Charg√© d'Affaires, Xaar, Heeremandi and Khumba Mela. The colt returned to England for his final appearance of the season in the Group One Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 18 October. Ridden by Frankie Dettori he started a 14/1 outsider and finished fourth, proving no match for Xaar, who won impressively by seven lengths. =1998: three-year-old season= Desert Prince began his second season in the European Free Handicap at Newmarket on 15 April in which he carried a weight of 131 pounds and started at odds of 7/1. Ridden by Peslier, he took the lead inside the final furlong and won by one and a quarter lengths from Trans Island. Sylvain Guillot took the ride when the colt was sent to France for the Group One Poule d'Essai des Poulains at Longchamp Racecourse on 10 May. He raced in second place for much of the race, but was unable to quicken in the straight and finished third behind Victory Note and Muhtathir. Two weeks later Desert Prince was sent to Ireland to contest the Irish 2000 Guineas oer one mile at the Curragh. Ridden as in all his subsequent races by Peslier he started at 8/1 in a field of seven runners, with the O'Brien-trained Second Empire, the winner of the Grand Crit√©rium being made the 4/5 favourite. After racing in second place behind the outsider Untold Story, Desert Prince took the lead two furlongs out and kept on well to win by three lengths from the Godolphin runner Fa-Eq. Desert Prince ran at Royal Ascot for the second time when he ran in the St James's Palace Stakes and started 4/1 second favourite against seven other three-year- old colts including Victory Note, Fa-Eq and the Henry Cecil-trained Dr Fong. In a change of tactics, Desert Prince took the lead from the start and had many of his rivals struggling early in the straight, but was caught in the final strides and beaten a neck by Dr Fong after what The Independent described as \\"a stirring battle\\". After a break of more than two and a half months, Desert Prince returned in the Group One Prix du Moulin at Longchamp on 6 September in which he was matched against older horses for the first time. In a race run on very soft ground he started at odds of 4.1/1 in a field of seven runners which included Second Empire, Zalaiyka (winner of the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches) and the Japanese trained Seeking the Pearl who had won the Prix Maurice de Gheest in August. Desert Prince raced in third place behind the Japanese colt before taking the lead 400 metres from the finish. He went clear in the closing stages to win by three lengths from the outsider Gold Away with second Empire two lengths further back in third. Loder said after the race \\"I knew he'd come on something like 10lb since Ascot and it just remained for him to confirm my opinion on the racecourse. The colt had pleased me in his work and physically throughout the summer. It was always the intention to give Desert Prince a break after the St James's Palace and aim him at the Moulin. He goes on all ground and is a top-class colt. The plan now is to run him in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes and then the Breeders' Cup Mile, before he retires to the Irish National Stud\\". Peslier commented: \\"Desert Prince would have been more impressive on better ground. I gave him time to build up momentum and he gave me a big effort\\". Three weeks later, Desert Prince started the 100/30 favourite for the Group One Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot. The race saw him pitted for the second time against Dr Fong, with the other runners including Second Empire, Cape Cross and the Sussex Stakes winner Among Men. Peslier tracked the leaders before ending the colt into the lead two furlong from the finish. He held off a challenge from Dr Fong to prevail by half a length with a gap of three and a half lengths back to Second Empire in third. After the race, Loder said of the horse that \\"ever since he arrived in the yard he has had a presence or an aura around him. Last year I thought he was the best horse I have trained and he has come good\\". On his final racecourse of the season he was sent to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Mile at Churchill Downs on 7 November. Loder explained that while the colt's victory at Ascot was \\"the icing on the cake\\", the Breeders' Cup would be \\"the cherry on the top\\". He started 3/1 second favourite behind Favorite Trick, but after being hampered in the early stages he was never in contention and finished last of the fourteen runners behind Da Hoss. In the International Classification, published in January 1999, Desert Prince was rated the best European three-year-old colt of 1998, one pound ahead of Dr Fong. Stud record Desert Prince was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at the Irish National Stud in County Kildare at a fee of ‚Ç¨20000 and was \\"shuttled\\" to stand at the Woodlands Stud in Australia for the Southern Hemisphere breeding season. He later had spells at the Gestut Isarland in Germany and the Scuderia Andy Capp in Italy. As of 2014, he stands at the Haras du Thenney near Saint-Pierre-Azif in Calvados, France at a fee of ‚Ç¨5000. His best winners have included Oriental Magic (Scottish Derby), Tarzi (Hyperion Stakes), Outback Prince (TJ Smith Stakes), France (Tetrarch Stakes), Mail The Desert and the leading hurdler My Tent Or Yours.

The ground was used by Nottingham Forest between 1879 and 1881, and by Notts County between 1880 and 1894.

The record League attendance at the ground was set on 17 September 1892 when 12,000 spectators saw Notts County and Derby County draw 1‚Äì1. At the end of the 1892‚Äì93 season it was used as a neutral venue to host the promotion/relegation test match between Sheffield United and Accrington, with Sheffield United winning 1‚Äì0 in front of 6,000 spectators. The final Notts County match at the Castle Ground was played on 15 September 1894, with 10,000 spectators seeing a 2‚Äì1 win over Darwen.

Black Girls Code (BGC) is a not-for-profit organization that focuses on providing technology education for African-American girls. Kimberly Bryant, an electrical engineer who had worked in biotech for over 20 years, founded Black Girls Code in 2011 to rectify the underrepresentation of African-American girls and women in the technology industry. The organization offers programs in computer programming, coding, as well as website, robot, and mobile application-building, with the goal of providing African-American youth with the skills to occupy some of the 1.4 million computing job openings expected to be available in the U.S. in 2020. Founding Bryant was inspired to start BGC after her gamer daughter, Kai, attended a computing summer camp and was disappointed in the experience. Her daughter was one in a handful of girls who were at the camp and was the only African American girl present. She also noted that the boys at the camp were given much more attention from the counselors than the few girls there. In an interview with Ebony, Bryant stated, \\"I wanted to find a way to engage and interest my daughter in becoming a digital creative instead of just a consumer, and I did not find other programs that were targeted to girls like her from underrepresented communities.\\" In 2011, Bryant convinced her colleagues from Genentech to create a six-week coding curriculum for Girls of Color. Her first educational series started in the basement of a college prep institution, and attended by a dozen girls, including her daughter. On January 2012, a tech consultancy company called ThoughtWorks invested in Bryant's initiative, providing her access to space and resources, and allowing the organization to prosper into an internationally recognized non-profit. As of December 2019, BGC has a total of 15 chapters. Organization BGC has become a rapidly growing phenomenon, quickly expanding in the USA and abroad. Headquartered in Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco, the organization grew to 2,000 students by August 2013 within the 7 established institutions operating in 7 States across the US, as well as in Johannesburg, South Africa. BGC seeks to double their reach by adding chapters in the US and Africa over the next two years. BGC also hosts bilingual workshops in partnership with Latino Startup Alliance. BGC's ultimate goal is \\"to grow to train 1 million girls by 2050 and become the 'girl scouts' of technology.\\" BGC depends on a vast body of volunteers to design and conduct workshop classes. Professionals from the IT sector share their expertise with the young students, helping them get acquainted with the fundamentals of software design in languages such as Scratch or Ruby on Rails. After school activities are alternated with day-long workshops; an extended course is held during the summer. BGC primarily relies on donations to fund its activities; 75% students are currently on scholarships. The motto of the Black Girls Code is: \\"Imagine. Build. Create. ‚Äì Imagine a world where everyone is given the tools to succeed, and then help us build ways for everyone to access information and create a new age of women of color in technology\\". Awards and grants Black Girls Code received a $50,000 grant from Microsoft's Azure development (AzureDev) community campaign in January 2014. Bryant also received a \\"Standing O-vation\\" presented by Oprah Winfrey and Toyota in November 2014. In August 2015, Bryant turned down a grant of $125,000 from ride-sharing app Uber, calling the move disingenuous and 'PR- driven'. She also criticized Uber for offering Girls Who Code $1.2 million, an amount nearly ten times larger. > \\"We were not happy with some of the things that were occurring in the > organization around the treatment of women as well as the treatment of > underrepresented minorities,\\" she told USA Today about Uber. \\"We also wanted > to make sure that we were supported in a way that we felt we deserved\\".

Brennan lost both his lower legs in a bomb attack whilst serving in the British army in Iraq in 2004. His rehabilitation saw him first attempt to compete in the Summer Paralympics in Beijing before switching to alpine ski sports. In 2014 he qualified for the Great Britain team for the Winter Paralympics in Sochi as a sit-skier. Personal history Brennan was born in 1979 and comes from the English town of Doncaster. He became a career soldier and joined the British Army. In January 2004, while on duty in Iraq, he answered a volunteer call to join the Royal Signal Bomb Squad, and became part of the Army's bomb disposal team. In late 2004, at the rank of sergeant, he was caught within the blast of a suicide bomb. The blast removed both of his legs below the knees and he landed heavily on his head placing him in a coma for two weeks. He was flown to Germany where he awoke from his coma, and spent the next three years attending Headley Court rehabilitation centre. Brennan's physical recovery was hampered by mental health issues, caused by damage sustained to his head during the bomb attack. In a 2014 interview Brennan stated that people have difficulty reading his emotive state, and that he has difficulty handling his anger. In 2011 his anger management issues led to the collapse of his marriage and his discharge from the Army after being sent home for misbehaviour from a Combined Services skiing camp. Sports career While at Headley Court, Brennan became first involved in parasport, joining the British Rowing project in 2007. Although not a favourite to break into an already established team, Brennan harboured aspirations to compete at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing. Although Brennan failed to make the team for Beijing, he continued entering sporting programs and in March 2008 he began to learn adaptive skiing. His natural ability saw him selected to join the Combined Services Disabled Ski Team and from there he was offered a place on the British Disabled Ski Team (BDST). In 2010 he made his first appearance on the slopes for the British national team. In the 2011 World Championships he finished 19th in the sitting Slalom and 23rd in the sitting Giant Slalom. At the 2013 IPC Alpine Skiing World Championships in La Molina, Spain, he took 9th place in the super combined, but broke his sternum the next day while preparing to compete in the giant slalom. His broken sternum resulted in a six-month absence from the slopes. In an international event at Thredbo, Australia, in September 2013, he received a bronze medal for a third-place finish in the sitting giant slalom. However, after returning to competitive skiing in the southern hemisphere he broke his wrist, which limited his ability to practice and compete prior to the 2014 Winter Paralympics. Despite this lack of practice he qualified for the Great Britain team that would be competing at the Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Russia; competing in the sit-ski events. The Sochi Games was his Paralympic debut. On arrival at Sochi, Brennan announced that he would not be competing at the downhill event, describing the slope as 'scary'. Expressing concerns shared by other competitors regarding the speed of the slope, Brennan was worried that it would be too dangerous to take part so soon after his recent injuries. Although out of the opening downhill competition, the next day Brennan took part in the Super-G event, finishing tenth, one of only 12 athletes out of the starting 31 to complete the course.

Nations Currently Served by IFDC  Nations Previously Served by IFDC  Research and development  By 2050, 60 percent more food will need to be grown annually to keep up with a rapidly growing population.World Agriculture Toward 2030/2050, FAO According to Vaclav Smil, man-made nitrogen fertilizers are keeping about 40% of the world's population alive. IFDC conducts research to identify the most efficient use of fertilizer raw materials and develops processes to use these materials in the sustainable and cost-effective manufacture of various fertilizer products. In Bangladesh, for example, IFDC introduced Urea Deep Placement (UDP) technology, an briquetted form of urea applied into the soil, which increases farmer incomes by an average of 20% and decreases nitrogen loss by up to 30%.http://aehof.eng.ua.edu/members/international-fertilizer-development- center/ Alabama Engineering Hall of Famehttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/12/071218192026.htm Science Daily. \\"Bangladesh To Dramatically Expand Technology That Doubles Efficiency Of Urea Fertilizer Use\\" Applied research also includes the development of more efficient cropping technologies, decision support tools and the agronomic evaluation of these products and processes to ensure their long-term viability in a free-market environment. =Fertilizer Deep Placement= During the mid to late 1980s, IFDC began research in India on several fertilizer types, one being the IFDC-developed fertilizer deep placement (FDP) technology, which was shown at the time to decrease nitrogen losses by 9% on sorghum crops. In 1986, the Center introduced FDP in Bangladesh where IFDC has promoted the technology ever since. Farmers are now using the technology on 1.7 million acres in that country alone. In 2007, IFDC began a new FDP campaign, spreading the technology to sub-Saharan Africa.https://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/increasing-yields-and- decreasing-fertilizer-waste-on-subsistence-farms/ FDP involves \\"briquetting\\" nitrogen fertilizer by compacting prilled fertilizer into 1-3 gram briquettes. The briquettes (either urea- or NPK-based) are then placed in a plant's root zone, as opposed to the traditional application method of broadcasting. Trials have shown that FDP and UDP (when only urea is used) can increase crop production up to 36 percent, reduce fertilizer use by up to 38 percent, and reduce nitrogen losses by up to 40 percent.http://www.usaid.gov/bangladesh/press-releases/research-shows- improved-fertilizer-application-increases-rice-and The technology, mainly promoted in lowland flooded rice, showed promising results in reducing nitrogen runoff, so in 2012, IFDC began research in Bangladesh to quantify GHG emissions produced from using FDP. Through the USAID-funded Accelerating Agricultural Productivity Improvement project, which integrated the U.S. government's Global Climate Change Initiative into its Feed the Future Initiative, research is currently underway.http://www.farmchemicalsinternational.com/uncategorized/ifdc- programs-designed-to-improve-crop-yields/ =Peak Phosphorus= Phosphorus is a key component of fertilizer, along with nitrogen and potassium. Predicting the future event of peak phosphate in which production of phosphate rock begins to decline as resources dwindle, researchers estimated that world phosphorus supplies would be used up by 2030 if mined and processed at its present rates. Depletion of this material would be a major complication for the fertilizer production sector. In 2010, IFDC geologist Steven Van Kauwenburgh estimated the world's supply of phosphate rock at 60 billion metric tonshttp://www.producer.com/2013/08/phosphorus-not-scarce-just-use- wisely-expert/ in the publication World Phosphate Rock Reserves and Resources. By his estimates, global resources of phosphate rock suitable to produce phosphate rock concentrate, phosphoric acid, phosphate fertilizers and other phosphate-based products will be available for several hundred years. His estimation overshadowed previous estimates of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) by 44 billion tons.https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/09/22/fertilizer-phosphate- idUSN2223379920100922 Upon review and intense scrutiny of the information in the report, the USGS revised its world phosphate rock reserve and resource numbers to more closely reflect those stated in the report.http://globalpnetwork.net/news/2011-01-26/usgs-revises-world-phosphate- rock-reserve-estimates-based-ifdc-study Areas of Expertise =Capacity Building= IFDC trains farmers to participate effectively in a global market while facing challenges in their specific local communities. This training works both with farming techniques on a hands-on agricultural level and with commercial concepts on an agribusiness level. =Competitive Agricultural Systems and Enterprises (CASE)= CASE consolidates local stakeholders to encourage innovation and growth while also developing a commodity value chain and involving public and private entities. IFDC developed CASE in 2004 to further promote agricultural intensification and strengthen the integration of farmers and local entrepreneurs. =Decision Support Tools (DSTs)= DSTs help farmers apply agricultural research based on geography and markets by using crop modeling and analyses of soil, weather and market information to increase yields and profits. IFDC has aided in the development of several tools, including the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT).http://dssat.net/contact-us =Fertilizer Deep Placement (FDP)= FDP involves \\"briquetting\\" nitrogen fertilizer by compacting prilled fertilizer into 1-3 gram briquettes.

Initiatives =Africa Fertilizer Summit= On June 9‚Äì13, 2006 heads of state and governments gathered in Abuja, Nigeria, for the Africa Fertilizer summit and called for the elimination of all taxes and tariffs on fertilizer in the historic ‚ÄúAbuja Declaration on Fertilizer for an African Green Revolution‚Äù. Summit participants also agreed on 12 resolutions designed to increase fertilizer use five-fold in 10 years in the Abuja Declaration.http://news.ahibo.com/spip.php?article18 IFDC helped organize and to implement the Summit. Dr. Amit Roy, then president and CEO of IFDC, in a corporate report address on the Summit stated, ‚ÄúThe obstacles to agricultural development in Africa are enormous and long-standing. Human, institutional and research capacity, as well as physical infrastructure, must be built to enable Africa to compete effectively. Policies should be changed to encourage business investment. Furthermore, as history has demonstrated, countries must take charge of their own futures if they are to build better futures for their children.‚Äùhttps://issuu.com/ifdcinfo/docs/afs_new The Summit was attended by 1,100 participants including five African heads of state, 15 ministers of agriculture, 17 members of the Summit's Eminent Persons Advisory Committee, and hundreds of leaders of international organizations, agricultural research centers and private sector companies. The Abuja Declaration was written at the conclusion of the Africa Fertilizer Summit on June 13, 2006, in Abuja, Nigeria. =Global Transdisciplinary Processes for Sustainable Phosphorus Management (Global TraPs)= The Global TraPs initiative brings together experts from a multitude of fields to build knowledge on how humans can make steps towards using phosphorus in a sustainable manner. The multi-stakeholder initiative is headed by Dr. Amit H. Roy, then IFDC president and CEO, and Dr. Roland W. Scholz, of Fraunhofer IWKS. More than 200 other partners worldwide participate in the project.http://www.iwks.fraunhofer.de/en/cooperation/global-traps-.html Recently, Global TraPs published a Springer book titled Sustainable Phosphorus Management: A Global Transdisciplinary Roadmap. The book discusses the economic scarcity of phosphorus and ways to increase efficiency and reduce environmental impacts of anthropogenic phosphorus flows at every stage of production, supply and use. =Virtual Fertilizer Research Center (VFRC)= The VFRC was an IFDC research initiative designed to create and disseminate the ‚Äúnext generation‚Äù of fertilizers.http://www.prweb.com/releases/IFDC_virtual_research/fertilizer/prweb3642214.htm The initiative, through a virtual network, engaged universities, public and private research laboratories and the global fertilizer and agribusiness industries in the development of new fertilizers.

Ulm School of Design ‚Äì Hochschule f√ºr Gestaltung hfg ‚Äì Professional life Claussen-Finks studied in the Department of Product Design, of which he was also the last elected student representative. He graduated with his research thesis \\"Individual Preference ‚Äì Subjective Esthetic Behavior\\"(\\"Subjektiv √Ñsthetisches Verhalten\\"). Participants of the study had to sort multiple kinds of natural stones into individual categories of their own likes and dislikes and also comment about their emotional impact in this process. Claussen-Finks was convinced there are individual types of \\"taste-groups\\" with similar preferences different from others. This category of individual taste, emotion and liking was extending the hfg¬¥s focus on ergonomics and geometrical forms. A form study by Claussen-Finks as a sliced model was selected to represent the hfg within the German Pavilion at the Montreal World Expo 1967. A project group at the hfg under Ohl and Kapitzki was developing this German pavilion.Michael Klar on Wikipedia As a student of the Ulm School of Design (Hochschule f√ºr Gestaltung hfg Ulm), Jochen Claussen-Finks was influenced by hfg members such as Gui Bonsiepe, Abraham Moles, Max Bill, Walter Zeischegg, Alexander Kluge and Kohei Sugiura. Gui Bonsiepe invited Claussen-Finks in 1967 to join the team of him an Franco Clivio for designing a presentation system for Milan-based department store La Rinascente, where Tom√°s Maldonado (second hfg rector after Max Bill) was the director of Corporate Image from 1967 to 1969.hfg archive timelineTom√°s Maldonado and the Impact of the Hochschule f√ºr Gestaltung in Italy ‚Äì The Corporate Image of La Rinascente, p.98ffFranco Clivio at Swiss Design Awards Still a student, Jochen Claussen-Finks began designing projects for IBM (color system for a production line), Daniel Peres (scissors), Perthen (measurement device for surfaces, IF Design Award) and Olympia Baugesellschaft mbH M√ºnchen (seats) where he worked for Hans (Nick) Roericht who was in the 1972 Summer Olympics design team of Otl Aicher (founder of the hfg and director of the visual conception commission of the Olympics).

Statements captured in the film, and his own experience, inspired Claussen- Finks for a future school following the hfg, a school focused on students interests and their activities, surrounded by inspiring information environment. In December 1989, Jochen Claussen-Finks was invited to the Industrial Design Centre IDC of the Indian Institute of Technology IIT Bombay to show for the first time his film \\"Weltoffenheit, Freiheit und schlichte Sch√∂nheit\\" about the history of the Ulm School of Design. The film was screened at the \\"Ulm and after\\"\\"Readings from Ulm\\" by Kirti Trivedi event and includes interviews with the school¬¥s architect Max Bill and former professors Abraham Moles, Harry Pross, Tom√°s Maldonado, Klaus Krippendorff. The title \\"Weltoffenheit, Freiheit und schlichte Sch√∂nheit\\" (Cosmopolitanism, freedom and simple beauty) is inspired by the original idea of the school¬¥s concept formulated by Inge Scholl.hfg archiv ulm At the IDC, Claussen-Finks proposed in a speech the future vision of how a \\"School of Ideas\\" could look like, anticipating new education concepts. For two weeks after the film screening, in January 1990, Claussen-Finks directed seminar sessions with the IDC students to work out concepts for a \\"School of Ideas\\" based on students interests, seeing themselves like a company, with no money but with ideas. In a poster he visualized for the first time a \\"School of Ideas ‚Äì Concept for Interaction\\" using a photograph with a barefoot Indian man reading a newspaper ‚Äì symbolizing the power of the mind.

Tensegrity structures, as defined by Buckminster Fuller tubes do not touch each other and are connected by ropes. This elastic structure gives a relaxed feeling to lie on and softens every movement.Tensegrity structure at DEPATIS A second prototype was designed to swim on water and offer a platform above the waves. Sliding Calendar invention in 1984.Sliding calendar at DEPATIS The conceptual idea of the calendar was to create something thin and intelligent smooth to use with one hand. The desired month is adjusted in a small window on the front from a code system on the back. The first company to use the calendar as a giveaway was IBM to promote the introduction of the Personal Computer with Charlie Chaplin as a cover print in Germany. The calendar works without a battery. After the white version, Claussen-Finks developed a relief surface for a black version of the calendar giving the impression of an electronic device. The permanent sliding calendar was invented by Claussen- Finks 24 years before Apple presented its first iPhone in 2008, where sliding on the screen with the finger appeared in an electronic consumer product for the first time.

The results are used to understand the customer, for internal video communication, training and new dialog concepts. Research on the interaction of human dialog and furniture in trade fair environment lead to Biological Concepting. One of the researches was titled \\"The elementary structures of well-being\\". Research on \\"Changing World News\\" is describing the changing face of the world in ultra short samples of text and images with reference articles for deeper understanding. Subjects can be rising urban population, new use of energy like flying around the world on solar power, digital impact on everyone\`s life and global businesses, or the hype of the art market.

The exhibition marks an important moment in the history of the Ulm art scene as it was the very first exhibition of photographs in the city of Ulm, organized by gallerist Carlos Cuenca-Ramirez.\\"Schwarzwei√ü f√ºr Tr√§umer: Tendenzwende am Beispiel einer Ulmer Fotoausstellung\\" (Black and white for dreamers: Change of trend on the example of a photo exhibition in Ulm), S√ºdwest Presse, 7 June 1978 Claussen-Finks idea was that his blurred images in black and white, taken with a Pentax 6x7, ask the viewers mind to uncover the world behind the image. The exhibition showed silver prints on paper and framed photo canvas. In the 1980s and 1990s, Jochen Claussen-Finks traveled extensively to Hydra, Greece, and India, where he continued to photograph and make film recordings. He takes on the philosophy of the \\"Places without Time\\" series in his most recent work of pigment prints on canvas \\"Distant Views\\", started in 2014. Through a special technique, he again creates blurred images of which the motives date back to his journeys to Hydra and India. \\"Distant Views\\" images submit a feeling of their subjects without giving details, following the tradition of Pictorialism, like he did with his earlier work \\"Places without Time\\" from 1978. Claussen-Finks believes that in a time of image consumption, pictures have to be re-individualized through the viewers mind and the collaboration of his imagination. Claussen- Finks' works and photographs can be found in private collections in Germany.

The workshop often huddled pacts to cope with the commission volumes, so that often the works of these sculptors are teamwork and can hardly be attributed to only one of them.

Life Born in Wesel, Germany, Becker was educated at the University of Bonn. After two years as an assistant in the Berlin Observatory, the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres appointed him in 1885 to take charge of his large private observatory at Dunecht, near Aberdeen. When that institution was wound up in the autumn of 1888, the instruments were passed on to the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury for a new Royal Observatory. A site on Blackford Hill in Edinburgh was selected in 1889 and Becker was included on the staff. He was appointed to the Glasgow Chair of Astronomy four years later. Ludwig was a popular lecturer at Glasgow and it was claimed that his classes were better attended than those of any other astronomy course in the United Kingdom. His research areas were extensive and he was a master of celestial mechanics. They included; * investigation on the distribution of blue-violet light in the solar corona at the eclipse of 30 August 1905, in Tunisia; * a long and careful investigation on the constant of aberration undertaken with the Glasgow Transit Circle; * a capture hypothesis relating to Binary stars, in which he showed how such a system could capture a third star, losing in the process one of its own components, and how the hypothesis could account for the high eccentricities of binary star orbits. Ludwig retired from the Chair of Astronomy in 1935. He left the University Observatory well equipped for contemporary needs, and in his earlier years he added significantly to its instrument collection. He died in Lugando in Italy. Anti-German sentiment Although Becker had become a naturalized British citizen in 1892 before his appointment to Glasgow, this fact failed to save him from embarrassment and unmerited suspicion during the Great War; local public opinion forced his absence from the University. He retired to seclusion in Aviemore, the Highlands, where he lived until the end of hostilities. This period had a negative effect upon his output in the post-war years. W.M.

Originally a set of small notebooks with black covers in which Heidegger jotted observations (some have said \\"sketches\\"), they have been collated into a 1,000-page transcript. Peter Trawny is editing the transcripts and publishing them in the Gesamtausgabe (GA). The first transcript was published in 2014. As of 2020, fourteen notebooks have been published encompassing the years 1931‚Äì1941 (GA 94‚Äì96). The notebooks from 1942‚Äì1945 are in private possession, but have already been prepared for publication. The first notebook, Anmerkungen I, now GA 97, was originally believed to be lost, but was found in the possession of Heidegger scholar Silvio Vietta, who had received it from his mother Dorothea. One notebook written in approximately 1930, sometimes called: ‚ÄúWinke √úberlegungen (I)‚Äù, is still missing (GA 97 p.521 note). Controversy When the transcripts were first published in 2014, they were edited by Peter Trawny. The notebooks contain explicitly antisemitic content, reigniting the debate about Heidegger's Nazism and its relationship to his philosophical project. Critics of this claim have countered it by pointing to the sketchbook character of the Black Notebooks and the intention of the author for them to remain private and unpublished ruminations on the cultural and philosophical ideas received via time and place. Others have cited an antisemitism that does not qualify as racial, social, interpersonal or political, but rather exists only in a certain use of received concepts and German philosophical commentary up to his time. argues in \\"Heidegger's Black Notebooks and the Question of Anti-Semitism\\" that \\"In Heidegger's case, it is a type of anti-Semitism that could be qualified as \\"religious,\\" \\"cultural,\\" or \\"spiritual.\\" In a letter to Hannah Arendt, in which he comments on the rumors about his anti-Semitism, it reads: \\"As to the rest, in matters related to the university I am as much an anti-Semite as I was ten years ago in Marburg. This anti-Semitism even found the support of Jacobstahl and Friedl√§nder. This has nothing to do with personal relationships (for example, Husserl, Misch, Cassirer and others).\\" When Heidegger speaks of \\"Judaization\\" (Verjudung), he does so from a given cultural context\\".

The nearer galaxy is approximately from Earth and is designated , while the lensed galaxy is distant and is designated ASW0009io9 (shortened to 9io9). It was discovered in January 2014 by Zbigniew \\"Zbish\\" Chetnik, an amateur astronomer from Northamptonshire, England, while classifying images on the website Spacewarps.org. The discovery was announced on the BBC television programme Stargazing Live. The term Spitch comes from Chetnik's nickname Zbish, after a BBC producer misheard his nickname.  Observations  The Red Radio Ring (RRR) was discovered by four independent groups, including the Space Warps project using deep images from the Canada‚ÄìFrance‚ÄìHawaii Telescope, a cross- match with Herschel-SPIRE and Planck images at 350 Œºm to identify strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) and follow up with Large Millimeter Telescope, a detection with Herschel-SPIRE 500 Œºm images to identify strongly lensed DSFGs, and identification of 9Spitch as the strongest lensed DSFG in the 278 GHz maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and follow-up with the Green Bank Telescope. The galaxy was studied with the Large Millimetre Telescope, which detected carbon monoxide in the lensed galaxy, and the Subaru Telescope, which detected different spectroscopic lines associated with star formation in the lensed galaxy. This study suggests a high star forming rate of about 2500 M ò yr ‚àí1 or a thousand times the star forming rate of the Milky Way. In the paper the name 9io9 is used instead of 9Spitch. The source reconstruction supports a compact core and an extended region, maybe indicative of a jet or lobe coming from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The galaxy might be in the center of a large galaxy group or cluster and it will likely evolve into a massive elliptical galaxy. Observations with the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) and detailed reconstruction of the lensed galaxy suggests an approximately diameter rotating disk of gas. 9Spitch was observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) 12-meter antennas in December 2017 as part of project 2017.1.00814.S. The data revealed the presence of atomic carbon and carbon monoxide as a tracer of star formation. It was estimated that the total star formation rate of the molecular ring is about . ALMA also detected the cyanide radical travelling twice the velocity of the rotation of the molecular ring, with a radial velocity of . This is explained as a possible interaction between material outflowing from the AGN and interstellar material. Harrington et al. (2019) reports four independent detections of the Red Radio Ring, including the detection with Space Warps. In their paper they report new Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) observations, presenting the detection of nitrogen [N II] 205 Œºm. The velocity structure of the nitrogen is similar to carbon monoxide and they concluded that both share the same volume. The ratio of the nitrogen luminosity and the infrared luminosity resembles more a normal star-forming galaxy and less a galaxy with star-formation influenced by a quasar.

The work was originally published in 1963 by Melville Nimmer, and was for several decades the only significant treatise in United States copyright law. In 1985, Melville's son David Nimmer took over updates and revisions to Nimmer on Copyright. The work is routinely cited by domestic and foreign courts at all levels in copyright litigation, and within the United States in at least 2500 judicial opinions. The United States Copyright Office held a special celebration on May 6, 2013, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the publication of Nimmer on Copyright.\\"Nimmer on Copyright: Celebrating 50 Years : David Nimmer\\", U.S. Copyright Office (2013).\\"\\"Nimmer on Copyright\\" Now Available As Video Podcast\\", Copyright NewsNet, Issue 511, July 9, 2013. Similarly, the Copyright Society of the U.S.A. published a special issue of the Journal dedicated to the 50th anniversary, in Winter 2013.F. Jay Dougherty, \\"A Story of Two Anniversaries: Nimmer and the Bulletin/Journal of the Copyright Society\\", 60 Journal of the Copyright Society U.S.A. 149 (Winter 2013). Notable cases In Bridgeman Art Library v. Corel Corp. the court held that photographs were \\"writings\\" within the meaning of the Copyright Clause and cited Nimmer on Copyright, which stated that there \\"appear to be at least two situations in which a photograph should be denied copyright for lack of originality\\". Judge Lewis Kaplan considered one of those situations, as described by Nimmer, to be directly relevant, namely that \\"where a photograph of a photograph or other printed matter is made that amounts to nothing more than slavish copying\\". A slavish photographic copy of a painting thus, according to Nimmer, lacks originality and thus copyrightability under the U.S. Copyright Act.
