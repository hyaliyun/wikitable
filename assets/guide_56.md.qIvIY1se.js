It is often applied to individuals of such great wealth and success that they feel they no longer have anything left in life to accomplish. It is common with people who assign great value to their career and, although they have achieved much, do not feel satisfied. The phrase may also refer to an episode of Star Trek, \\"The Paradise Syndrome\\", and in this instance, deals with being overworked and needing a break, rather than a feeling of dissatisfaction related to achieving one's dreams. In popular culture The titular character in the Simon and Garfunkel song \\"Richard Cory\\" (based on the Edward Arlington Robinson poem of the same title) epitomises Paradise Syndrome. A major character in the television series Psychoville named Oscar Lomax suffers from Paradise Syndrome. The only way for him to be 'cured' usually involves a topsy-turvy game of cat-and-mouse with a stuffed 'commodity' (children's toy) which he finds and then deliberately loses. In Night Train (1997) by Martin Amis, Paradise Syndrome is proffered as a possible explanation for the suicide of Jennifer Rockwell, a young woman who seemingly had everything: beauty, intelligence, health, a devoted lover and a stimulating career. The investigation of her suicide reveals clues to another explanation that the central character, detective Mike Hoolihan, suspects Jennifer herself may have left as an elaborate decoy. Agent Smith, a major character in the Matrix franchise of movies, mused about a future humanity's experience with the paradise syndrome during his interrogation of Morpheus in The Matrix. > Agent Smith (viewing the city below): Have you ever stood and stared at it, > marveled at its beauty, its genius? Billions of people just living out their > lives, oblivious. Did you know that the first Matrix was designed to be a > perfect human world. Where none suffered. Where everyone would be happy. It > was a disaster. No one would accept the program. Entire crops were lost. > Some believed that we lacked the programming language to describe your > perfect world. But I believe that as a species, human beings define their > reality through misery and suffering. The perfect world was a dream that > your primitive cerebrum kept trying to wake up from. Which is why the Matrix > was redesigned to this, the peak of your civilization. In the episode 'Time On Our Hands' of the TV series 'Only Fools and Horses', Del Boy exhibits Paradise Syndrome after finally becoming a millionaire, when in the closing moments of this episode he throws his snooker cue down and starts trying to convince Rodney they need to make investments with all their riches.

Both countries are full members of the Union for the Mediterranean, although Syria suspended its membership in 2011.Union for the Mediterranean: time for parliaments to play their role, European ParliamentUnion of the Mediterranean: Who we are In 2012, relations between the two countries soured, and in 2013, Croatia recognised the Syrian opposition as the sole legitimate representatives of the Syrian people.  History  Croatia and Syria signed a treaty establishing bilateral relations between the countries on 29 August 1997. By the 2000s, Croatia and Syria had active trade exchanges, while Syria exported foodstuffs, vegetables, cotton materials and imports from its chemical materials, oil and gas equipment, and sea products to Croatia.On 18 July 2008, Croatia and Syria signed an agreement on prevention of double taxation; and on 21 December 2008, the countries signed an agreement on air transport. After the start of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, relations between the two countries turned less positive. On 23 February 2012, Croatian prime minister Zoran Milanović called on Croatian companies to follow the Croatian national oil company INA and withdraw from Syria due to the ongoing armed conflict. He said that companies have to pull out until a democratic order is implemented in Syria. Deputy prime minister Radimir Čačić said INA's decision to halt operations in Syria brought Croatia in line with EU sanctions against doing business in Syria. Syrian oil minister Sufian al-Alao accused INA for incorrectness towards Syrian people and stated that withdrawal of INA from Syria was a cringe to the European Union, since Croatia wasn't an EU member at the time. Al-Alao also confirmed that INA's return to Syria is impossible because of such matters. Nevertheless, on 27 August 2012, in an interview for Večernji list the Governor of the Homs Governorate and close associate of Syria's president Bashar al-Assad, Ahmed Munir, called Croatia a great friend of Syria and stated that INA would be able to return once situation in Syria becomes calm. Croatia suffers damage of hundreds of millions of Euros due to the sanctions it applies on Syria together with other 27 EU member states as well as many other members of the international community. Croatian entrepreneurs are forbidden to sell weapons, ammunition and military vehicles to Syria and also to purchase, import or transfer Syrian oil. On 1 April 2012, Croatian Foreign Minister Vesna Pusić attended the summit of the \\"Friends of Syria\\" in Istanbul. On 18 January 2013, Croatian Foreign Ministry declared that Croatia, as well as the entire European Union, recognizes the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces as the only \\"legitimate representatives of the aspirations of the Syrian people\\".http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/rh-priznala-sirijsku- oporbu-kao-legitimnog-predstavnika- naroda-499500http://www.index.hr/vijesti/clanak/hrvatska-priznala-sirijsku- oporbu-kao-jedinu-legitimnu-vlast-u-siriji/657850.aspx On 25 February 2013, it was confirmed that a large amount of weapons was sent to the rebels in Syria from Croatia and that the weapons were financed by Saudi Arabia. The cargo arrived in Jordan in December 2012. Nevertheless, Croatian Foreign Ministry and arms-export agency denied the involvement, while the Jordanian authorities refused to give any statement on the matter. On 28 February, Croatia's Prime Minister Milanović said that Croatia will withdraw its troops from the Golan Heights that are participating in the UN's peacekeeping mission because of the article published in the New York Times about the Croatia's involvement in aiding the rebels in Syria.  State visits  On 21 December 2008, Croatia's president Stjepan Mesić visited Syria's president Bashar al-Assad in Damascus on Assad's invitation. The presidents discussed Croatian–Syria economic cooperation and the situation in the Middle East. On 28 October 2009, Syria's President Bashar al-Assad visited Mesić in Zagreb. He announced that the purpose of his visit is to improve the relations between the countries. Mesić expressed his wishes for better economic cooperation between Croatia and Syria and said that Croatia's entry to the European Union would not be an obstacle to their relations. He also added that Croatia did not use all of its business opportunities in cooperation with Syria. The presidents discussed the situation at the Middle East as well. Assad is the first Syrian president to visit Croatia. On 29 October, Mesić suggested that Israeli and Syrian representatives should have a meeting at Croatian island of Brijuni. Mesić said that he has a close contact with Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and that he is holding frequent talks with him on improvement of the relationship between Croatia and Syria. He described Assad as serious\\" and \\"intelligent\\" leader and he supported return of the Golan Heights back to Syria.

Italy has an embassy in Libya's capital, Tripoli, and a general consulate in Benghazi. Libya has an embassy in Italy's capital, Rome, and two general consulates (in Milan and Palermo).  History  Between 1911 and 1947, what is now Libya was an Italian colony. Both countries established diplomatic relations in 1947. In 1970, Libya expelled all Italians from Libya and confiscated their possessions. While Libya was considered a pariah by much of the international community under the rule of Muammar Gaddafi, Italy maintained diplomatic relations with Libya and exported a significant quantity of its oil from the country. Relations between Italy and Libya warmed in the first decade of the 21st century, when they entered co-operative arrangements to deal with illegal immigration into Italy. Libya agreed to aggressively prevent migrants from sub-Saharan Africa from using the country as a transit route to Italy, in return for foreign aid and Italy's successful attempts to have the European Union lift its trade sanctions on Libya. On 30 August 2008 Italy signed a Treaty confessing to and apologizing for the damages suffered by the Libyan people during the period of Italian colonialism, and that was the first time in history that a country had apologized and compensated (5 billion dollars plus the medical care for those who were harmed from the remnants of colonialism) for its previous colonization. The Treaty on Friendship, Partnership and Cooperation between Italy and Libya is composed of three parts: general principles; closing with the past and ending the disputes; and partnership. The first part begins with an official condemnation of Italy's colonization of Libya. The second part, closing with the past, contains the reparations payment of $5 billion to be paid in annual installments of $250 million over a 20-year period. The third, most important part of the Treaty deals with partnership. While the countries planned to cooperate in the areas of culture, economy, science, non- proliferation and more, the foremost area of cooperation pertains to immigration. Notably, the Libyan coast is to be patrolled by mixed (Libyan and Italian) crews on boats to be provided by Italy. Additionally, Libya's land borders are to be monitored using a satellite detection system provided by both the European Union and the Italian government. The Treaty has raised some human right concerns about the fates of immigrants turned away as a result of this process. According to the European court of human rights, or ECHR, Italy working with Libya to return migrants to Libya against their will violates their human rights. In Libya the migrants are subject to inhumane conditions, beatings, rape, and other human rights violations. In 2009, Gaddafi visited Italy for the first time in his 40-year rule. However, when Gaddafi faced a civil war in 2011, Italy imposed a freeze on some Libyan assets linked to him and his family, pursuant to a United Nations-sponsored regime and then bombed the country with the violation of Libya of the No-Fly Zone. After the death of Gaddafi, Italy recognized the National Transitional Council as the government of Libya. On 26 September 2011, Italian energy company Eni announced it had restarted oil production in Libya for the first time since the start of the 2011 Libyan civil war. The quick return of Eni to Libyan oilfields reflected the positive relations between Rome and Tripoli under the NTC. The Italian embassy in Tripoli is one of the few Western embassies still active in Libya during the Post-civil war violence in Libya because Italy is the most important trade partner for Libya.

George C. Royal was also part of one of the few African-American husband-and-wife teams in science, working with Gladys W. Royal, Ph.D. on research supported by the United States Atomic Energy Commission. George C. Royal is a professor emeritus at Howard University. Early life Royal was born in Williamston, South Carolina, in 1921, the oldest boy of nine children of African-American and Native American descent. His father, George Sr., owned an auto garage there before migrating his family to Urbana, Ohio, during the Great Depression. Dr. Royal has six children: George Calvin Royal III, Geraldine Gynnette Royal, Guericke Christopher Royal, jazz musician Gregory Charles Royal, Michelle Renee McNear, and Eric Marcus Royal. College and early professional career Royal attended Tuskegee Institute from 1939 to 1943, earning a B.S. in Biology before serving in the Army in World War II as a munitions sergeant, ending at the Battle of the Bulge in 1945. After the war, he attended the University of Wisconsin, where he received an M.S. in Microbiology in 1947. Royal took on positions as Bacteriology instructor at Tuskegee in 1947-48; research assistant at Ohio State University and Ohio Agricultural Experiment Station from 1948 to 1952. He was assistant professor of Bacteriology at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College in Greensboro from 1952 to 1955. Ph.D and beyond In 1955 Royal gained admission to the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League institution, where he received his Ph.D in microbiology as a predoctoral fellow in 1957. Dr. Royal was associate and professor of Bacteriology at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College in Greensboro from 1957 to 1965; and in 1959 he served a summer research fellowship for the United States Atomic Energy Commission, Biology Division, at Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Studies. He was the dean of the Graduate School at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College in Greensboro from 1961 to 1965. Following a postdoctoral study in allergy and hypersensitivity and an assistant professorship in Microbiology at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia from 1965 to 1966, he joined the faculty of Howard University from 1966 to 1993. He became professor emeritus in 1993.  Partnership in marriage and work  Royal married Gladys Geraldine Williams in 1947 while attending the University of Wisconsin. Gladys W. Royal (1926–2002) was an African-American biochemist, who graduated from Dillard University with a B.Sc. at the age of 18 in 1944, received an M.Sc. from Tuskegee in 1954, and would receive her Ph.D from Ohio State University several years later - a rare feat for an African-American female in the 1950s. The Royals would collaborate on important research including that funded by the United States Atomic Energy Commission involving bone marrow transplants to treat radiation overdoses. African-American husband-and-wife teams in science were extremely rare in the early and mid-20th century due to the social, educational and economic climate regarding African Americans in the United States. Research The Atomic Energy Commission supported at least five grants for funding research on bone marrow transplants, which were proposed jointly by George and Gladys W. Royal. Their work was written and presented at various conferences, including the Fifth International Congress on Nutrition Washington, DC 1960 and the International Congress on Histochemistry and Cytochemistry held in Paris, France in 1960.

The city is known for the much venerated Marian National Shrine of Our Lady of El Cisne. History The inhabitants of El Cisne region had wanted their own virgin Mary shrine similar to the Virgin of Guadalupe in Mexico City. Representatives of the city in 1594 requested sculptor Don Diego de Robles to build the Virgin de El Cisne statue which he made from the wood of a cedar tree. Each year on August 17 thousands of pilgrims gather in El Cisne to carry the Virgin Mary statue in a religious procession to the cathedral of Loja where it is the focus of a great festival on September 8 and is later returned to El Cisne.https://sacredsites.com/americas/ecuador/el_cisne.html Image gallery File:Basílica Del Cisne.JPGMarian National Shrine of Our Lady of El Cisne File:Virgin of El Cisne.jpgAltar of the Marian National Shrine of Our Lady of El Cisne with the icon of the virgin in the center.

Evans was capped four times for Wales, all during the 1922 Five Nations Championship. Rugby career Evans was first selected for Wales in 1922 while representing Swansea at club level. Evans first game was against England at the Cardiff Arms Park under the captaincy of Tom Parker. Wales won in style, scoring a then record eight tries. All five Swansea players representing Wales in that match scored, Evans, Parker, Bowen and Palmer all scored tries, and Joe Rees completed two conversions. Evans was back on the scoresheet in his very next match, scoring a very late drop goal to grab a draw against Scotland at Inverleith.Godwin (1984), pg 135. Evans scored in both remaining games of the tournament, scoring tries in both wins over Ireland and then France. In the game against France, Evans was not originally chosen to play, but shortly before the kick-off the Welsh selectors dropped Frank Palmer and Harold Davies, and replaced them with Evans and Cliff Richards. Although becoming a Championship winner and scoring in every international game, Evans was not selected to represent Wales after 1922. This was due to having to retire from rugby because of a serious cartilage injury to his knee. =International matches played= WalesSmith (1980), pg 465. * 1922 * 1922 * 1922 * 1922 Bibliography * * References Category:1898 births Category:1974 deaths Category:Welsh rugby union players Category:Wales international rugby union players Category:Rugby union centres Category:Swansea RFC players Category:Llanelli RFC players Category:Rugby union players from Llanelli ","title":"Islwyn Evans"},{"id":"20794193","text":"Ravindra Kelekar (7 March 1925 – 27 August 2010) was a noted Indian author who wrote primarily in the Konkani language, though he also wrote in Marathi and Hindi. A Gandhian activist, freedom fighter and a pioneer in the modern Konkani movement, he is a well known Konkani scholar, linguist, and creative thinker. Kelkar was a participant in the Indian freedom movement, Goa's liberation movement, and later the campaign against the merger of the newly formed Goa with Maharashtra. He played a key role in the founding of the Konkani Bhasha Mandal, which lead the literary campaign for the recognition of Konkani as a full-fledged language, and its reinstatement as the state language of Goa. He authored nearly 100 books in the Konkani language, including Amchi Bhas Konkaneech, Shalent Konkani Kityak, Bahu-bhashik Bharatant Bhashenche Samajshastra and Himalayant, and also edited Jaag magazine for more than two decades. Kelekar died at Apollo Hospital at Margao, Goa at around 11.30 am on Friday 27 August. He was 85. His remains were cremated with State honours at his native village of Priol. Kelekar received the Padma Bhushan (2008), the Gomant Sharada Award of Kala Academy, the Sahitya Akademi Award (1977), and the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship (2007)—the highest award of the Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters. He also received the 2006 Jnanpith Award, the first ever awarded to an author writing in the Konkani language, which was presented in July 2010. Early life and education Kelekar was born on 7 March 1925, in the city of Cuncolim in South Goa. His father, Dr Rajaram Kelekar, was a physician who later became renowned for his Portuguese translation of the Bhagwad Gita. While still a student at the Lyceum High School in Panaji, Kelekar joined the Goa liberation movement in 1946. This brought him in close contact with several local and national leaders, including Ram Manohar Lohia, under whose influence he was able to recognise the power of language to mobilise the local populace. Later, he saw the potential in his native Konkani language, which became his lifelong work. Career Already deeply influenced by Gandhian philosophy, in 1949 Kelekar left his native Goa for Wardha, to be with noted Gandhian and writer Kakasaheb Kalelkar. Kelekar stayed under Kalelkar's tutelage until 1955, when he was appointed librarian of the Gandhi Memorial Museum in New Delhi. This turned out to be short-lived, as only a year later he plunged back into the Goa freedom movement. With a mission to reconnect the Goan diaspora all over the world, he started the weekly, Gomant Bharati (1956–60), published in the Latin script in Bombay. Soon after, being an active participant in Goa's struggle for freedom, he was imprisoned by the Portuguese. He was released when the Indian Army invaded and annexed Goa in 1961. He joined the socio- political campaign against the merger of Goa into the neighbouring Maharashtra state, which ended after the plebiscite of 1967 (the Goa Opinion Poll), with Goa retaining its separate identity as a union territory. Goa retained this status until 1987, when it was declared a state. After Goa's independence, Kelekar took to literary activism, getting his native tongue, Konkani, recognized as a distinct language (rather than a dialect of Marathi). He was compared favourably with pioneers in the Konkani literary movement, such as Shenoi Goembab. During this period, he wrote some of his most important works promoting the Konkani language, including Aamchi Bhas Konkanich (1962), a dialogue revealing the importance of Konkani to the common man on the street; Shallent Konkani Kityaak (1962), highlighting the significance of having Konkani medium schools in Goa; and A Bibliography of Konkani Literature in Devanagari, Roman and Kannada characters (1963). In February 1987, the Goa Legislative Assembly had passed the Official Language Bill making Konkani the Official Language of Goa. The struggle ended in 1992, when Konkani was included in the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution as an official language. With life's mission completed, Kelkar retired from public life, focusing mainly of his writing. On 26 February 1975, the Sahitya Akademi, India's National Academy of Letters, recognised Konkani as an independent language. The first Sahitya Akademi Award for a work in Konkani was won by Kelekar for his travelogue, Himalayant, in 1977. The Akademi's first Translation Award in Konkani also went to Kelekar in 1990 for Ami Taankan Manshant Haadle, a Konkani translation of a collection of essays in Gujarati, Mansaeena Diva, by Jhaverchand Meghani. He received the 2006 Jnanpith Award, which was the first given to a Konkani-language writer. The pinnacle of his career came with the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship for lifetime achievement in 2007. A lifelong proponent of regional languages, in his acceptance speech for the Jnanpith award, he said, \\"People have stopped reading books in regional languages. On the other hand, through English, we have created Bonsai intellectuals, Bonsai writers and Bonsai readers.\\" When the Vishwa Konkani Sahitya Academy, an offshoot of the Konkani Language and Cultural Foundation, was set up in 2006, the first work it took up for translation was Velavaylo Dhulo, a collection of Kelekar's essays. His books have been translated into Hindi and other North Indian languages, and are used by universities. Personal life Kelekar married Godubai Sardessai in 1949; their son Guirish was born within a year. Kelekar lived in his ancestral home—built by his father in 1937—called \\"Kelekar House\\", in the village of Priol in central Goa. The Casa Dos Kelekars, as it is formally known, is now seen as exemplary of a typical Goan community home.

It was Lycoming Engines' first horizontally opposed aircraft engine and was produced from 1938 until the late 1940s. The family includes the reduction-geared GO-145.Christy, Joe: Engines for Homebuilt Aircraft & Ultralights, pages 64-65 TAB Books, 1983. The O-145 received its Approved Type Certificate on 13 Jun 1938. Design and development The O-145 was produced in three major versions, the O-145-A rated at , the -B rated at , and -C rated at . The \\"B\\" model was the major production model, with the \\"A\\" and \\"C\\" produced in much smaller quantities. All models of the series had the same bore, stroke, and displacement, additional horsepower being generated by increasing compression ratio and maximum rpm. All use a Stromberg NA-S2 or NA-S2A or Marvel MA-2 or MA-2-A carburetor. The dual ignition versions use two Scintilla SF-4L, SN4LN-20 or -21, Superior SMA-4 or Edison-Splitdorf RMA-4 magnetos. The original O-145-A produced at 2300 rpm, weighed , and featured single ignition. In an attempt to compete with the Continental A-65, Lycoming boosted the rpm and power output to at 2550 rpm, and finally at 3100 rpm. The O-145 had a hard time competing with the same horsepower Continentals due to its smaller displacement, which resulted in a steeper torque curve. The GO-145 is a geared model, introduced in 1938, that uses a 27:17 reduction ratio (1.59:1) gearbox to produce at 3200 crankshaft rpm, giving 2013 propeller rpm. The engine employs a gearbox bolted to the front of the engine and the resulting engine weighs without starter or generator. The GO-145 suffered from a poor reputation for reliability, because pilots mis-handled the engine, running it at too low a cruising rpm and causing gearbox wear as a result. The series' type certificate expired on 2 November 1950 and no O-145-B1 or -C1 or GO-145-C1s engines produced after 1 August 1941 and O-145-B2, -B3 or -C2, or GO-145-C2 or -C3s produced after 24 August 1949 are eligible for certification. The single ignition O-145-A series, O-145-B1, and -C1 are not covered by the original type certificate. Lycoming ended production of the O-145 and replaced it with the O-235 series.

She was trained by Sabiha Gökçen, Turkey's first female pilot. Biography Born in Vidin, Bulgaria of Turkish descent, she immigrated to Turkey as she was impressed by the Turkish female pilot Sabiha Gökçen's flight tour around the Balkan countries and the air show at Sofia in 1938. At the age of sixteen, she enrolled at the flight school Türkkușu (literally Turkishbird) of the Turkish Aeronautical Association, where Sabiha Gökçen was a trainer. Nezihe Viranyalı learned skydiving first, and later obtained her pilot license for gliders and airplanes. She was the last of the four female aviators trained by Sabiha Gökçen, the others being Edibe Subaşı, Yıldız Uçman, and Sahavet Karapas. She herself trained hundreds of aviators at the Türkkușu Flight School. In 1955, she took part as a skydiver at the international air shows held in the Netherlands and Germany. Invited by the American pilot Jacqueline Cochran, she went to the United States to attend a course on civil aviation at the University of Tennessee on a scholarship. In 1956, Nezihe Viranyalı displayed her flying skills at an air show in Baghdad, Iraq. In her career, she parachuted more than 100 times, had more than 180 hours of flight time on gliders and more than 2,800 hours on airplanes. Nezihe Viranyalı retired from her position as an instructor from the Türkkușu Flight School. She is quoted as saying > \\"If you’ve made a good landing, it’s impossible to recapture that joy again > on another day.

Forming out of a tropical disturbance on October 13, Omar initially moved slowly in the eastern Caribbean Sea. By October 15, Omar began to quickly intensify as deep convection developed around the center of circulation. Later that day, an eye developed and the storm began to accelerate to the northeast. Early on October 16, Omar reached its peak intensity with maximum winds of 130 mph (215 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 958 mbar (hPa; 28.29 inHg). Shortly after, the hurricane rapidly weakened to Category 1 intensity. After slightly re-strengthening the next day, Omar weakened to a tropical storm before degenerating into a non-convective low pressure area. The remnants of Omar persisted until October 21, at which time they dissipated to the west of the Azores. Throughout the eastern Caribbean, Omar affected numerous islands, most of which only recorded minor impacts. Large swells and heavy rains impacted the ABC islands. Antigua and Barbuda sustained $54 million in damages, mainly on Antigua as nine homes were destroyed, several others damaged and many farms were inundated by flood waters. One person died in Puerto Rico after suffering a stress-induced cardiac arrest. The United States Virgin Islands also sustained significant damage, costing roughly $6 million. Numerous boats and homes were damaged and over 100 power poles were snapped. Total losses from the storm were estimated at $79 million. Meteorological history On September 30, a well-developed tropical wave moved off the eastern coast of Africa and entered the Atlantic Ocean. Deep convection formed around a prominent mid-level circulation as it moved towards the west. However, the convection diminished on October 2 before entering the Caribbean Sea a week later. Upon entering the Caribbean Sea, shower and thunderstorm activity redeveloped around the low. Continued development followed and the low was designated as Tropical Depression Fifteen at 0600 UTC on October 13 while located about 190 miles (305 kilometres) south of the southeastern tip of the Dominican Republic. The previous steady westward motion that the system took across the Atlantic halted as it entered an area of weak steering currents and significant motion was not expected for another day or two. As the structure of the storm improved, it was upgraded to a tropical storm and the National Hurricane Center (NHC) gave it the name Omar. Located to the southeast of a broad and deep tropospheric trough and to the west of a low to mid-level ridge, Omar took a counter-clockwise turn on October 14\\\\. Upon becoming a tropical storm, Omar began to undergo an extended period of rapid intensification as very deep convection developed around the center of circulation. Wind shear around the storm, which was previously inhibiting quick development, weakened, allowing for further strengthening. Later that day, an 11.5 to 17.2 mi (18.5 to 27.7 km) wide eye formed as the storm began to turn towards the northeast due to the trough. With the formation of an eye, the Dvorak technique rendered an intensity of 75 mph (120 km/h), signifying that Omar had intensified into a hurricane. The intensification briefly stalled as the eyewall eroded and the center of the storm became slightly elliptical. However, deep convection persisted and strengthening was forecast as the storm neared Puerto Rico. Shortly after, the eye quickly became well- defined and appeared on visible satellite images, an indication the storm was intensifying. The chances of rapid intensification were good as the storm featured well-developed outflow and prominent banding features. With very warm sea surface temperatures, high ocean heat content, low wind shear, and a moist air mass, Omar quickly reached its peak intensity early on October 16 as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 130 mph (215 km/h). During the intensification phase, the forward motion of the hurricane increased to 20 mph (32 km/h). Once in the Atlantic Ocean, Omar began to rapidly weaken, with winds decreasing by 50 mph (85 km/h) in 12 hours. Visible satellite images depicted an exposed low-level circulation with convection displaced to the east due to a combination of very high wind shear and dry air. By October 17, most of the deep convection associated with the system dissipated; however, a brief decrease in wind shear allowed Omar to re-strengthen to its secondary peak, with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h). During this phase, convection redeveloped around the center and an eye reformed. Later that day, the trough that caused the rapid northeastern motion bypassed Omar, leading to decreasing movement. Hurricane Omar at its secondary peak with winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) A weakening storm, Omar continued towards the northeast due to a mid to upper- level ridge located south of the system and the mid-latitude westerlies to the north. Late on October 17, wind shear increased once more as Omar tracked over waters below . Around 0000 UTC on October 18, Omar weakened to a tropical storm as deep convection associated with it dissipated. Twelve hours later, while still producing tropical storm-force winds, the storm degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area. The remnants of Omar persisted until 0600 UTC on October 21, when they dissipated about 805 mi (1,295 km) west of the Azores. Preparations alt=Animated satellite loop of a hurricane intensifying and weakening over a 24-hour span. The images are from a colorized infrared satellite. On October 15, the governor of the United States Virgin Islands announced the final preparations for Hurricane Omar as he signed a State of Emergency declaration for the territory. Public schools would be closed on October 16\\\\. All non-essential workers would be dismissed at 10 a.m. local time. At 6 p.m. curfew was put in place for the same day. Only those with valid passes would be allowed to be out after the curfew was put in place. That same day, a Hurricane Warning and flash flood watch were put in place in anticipation of hurricane-force winds and torrential rains from Omar. The American Red Cross planned to open shelters throughout the islands before the hurricane struck. Sandbags were also being distributed in St. Croix. A large oil refinery, which produces , was shut down and only necessary workers remained at the refinery. On Sint Maarten, officials advised residents to start all necessary actions to prepare for a hurricane. Residents were told to clear their yards of any debris or lose furniture that could become airborne during the storm, place shutters over windows and doors and assist elderly neighbors with shuttering their homes, and mariners should find a safe haven. A curfew from 10:00 p.m. on October 15 to 10:00 a.m. on October 16 was put in place. Due to the possibility of flash flooding, residents were to unclog and free up all waterways around their homes. Officials also warned people to stay away from areas prone to landslides until the \\"all-clear\\" was given. Owners of livestock were advised to have insured that they were secured in holding areas. As a precaution, the water supply would be shut down from 8:00 p.m. October 15 to 8:00 a.m. October 16\\\\. Four public areas, St. Peters Community Center, Dutch Quarter Community Center, Genevieve de Weever School, and the Salvation Army building would be used as emergency shelters. All public activities, flights, and schools were either closed or canceled on Puerto Rico. Eighteen shelters were open on the eastern part of the island. Also, on Anguilla, residents in the Sandy Ground, Valley Bottom, Welches and Mount Fortune areas were placed under evacuation orders. Shelters were opened throughout the island for those in need of shelter. Schools and government offices were also closed and visitors were told to leave the island. Impact Omar produced moderate damage throughout numerous islands, amounting to at least $80 million (2008 USD) and one death was related to the storm. alt=A large tree knocked over on a fence. The ground throughout the image is wet and near the tree, it is torn by the roots. While it was moving little over the south-central Caribbean, Omar brought prolonged tropical storm conditions to the ABC Islands. Sustained winds to near gale force battered the islands, although peak gusts to were confined to Bonaire. In 24 hours, a maximum precipitation total of was recorded on Aruba, while and of rain fell in Curaçao and Bonaire, respectively. The high winds damaged roofs on all three islands, and rough seas caused beach erosion and significant damage to coastal facilities. Some rain damage also occurred, with significant flooding reported in some parts of Aruba. In the SSS Islands (Saba, St. Eustatius, and Sint Maarten) strong winds from Omar, gusting up to , and high waves caused significant damage and coastal flooding. On Sint Maarten, rainfall from the storm totaled to . Damage in Sint Maarten was mainly limited to beach erosion and scattered power outages. The island of Dominica suffered severe damage from Hurricane Omar. The village of Scotts Head, with a population of 450, was cut off from the rest of the country as roads were extensively damaged. The village also suffered water losses, electricity shortage, and landline telephones were cut off. Ports throughout the country were severely damaged. All barge access for hauling sand and stones were destroyed. The airport also sustained some damage. Seven boats ran aground during the storm. Minor damage was reported in Anguilla. Two hotels sustained roof damage, downed treed knocked down power lines causing scattered power outages, and the rough seas caused severe beach erosion. Three cargo ships and seven boats ran aground and two other boats sank. In Antigua and Barbuda, winds from Omar were recorded at , with gusts to . Intense squall lines brought torrential rains, falling at rates of at times, peaking at per hour from 0900 UTC to 1200 UTC on October 16\\\\. The maximum recorded rainfall was however, up to was estimated to have fallen in the mountains. Storm Surge was estimated at with waves reaching in height. Nine homes were destroyed and several landslides were reported. No fatalities were associated with Omar, and only a few sustained minor injuries. The most severe damage was dealt to roads and agriculture due to flooding. Seventy-five people were forced to evacuate to shelters as their homes were flooded. Several farms were washed away, including their livestock. Numerous farmers lost their harvest due to flooding. Damages in Barbuda were estimated at $18 million. Agricultural losses in Antigua amounted to around $11 million (2008 USD) and property damage amounted to $25 million. In Puerto Rico, a man died after he collapsed from cardiac arrest while trying to install storm shutters on his home. As a tropical wave, the precedent to Omar produced heavy rains over the island, causing minor flooding. After passing by Puerto Rico a second time, Omar produced locally heavy rains, which caused minor street flooding. On St. Croix, waves up to from Omar sank about 47 boats, leading to a large oil spill around the islands. About 400 ships broke lose from the docks, 200 of which lost their anchors. Omar produced upwards of of rain on the island within a 24‑hour span. Although St. Croix was brushed by the eyewall, sustained winds reached with gusts to . Three people needed to be rescued when their ship struck a reef and began to sink. Most of the islands 55,000 residents were without power as over 100 utility poles were destroyed. Damages on the island were estimated at $700,000 with another $1 million in clean-up costs. St. Thomas, one of the hardest hit islands, was left completely without power in the wake of the hurricane. All of the major intersections were shut down as traffic lights were either on the ground or without power. Damages on the island totaled to $5.3 million. In the Gros Islet Quarter on St. Lucia, rough seas damaged a jetty and grounded a yacht. In Soufrière, four homes were destroyed by the storm surge, which also made some areas impassible. The storm surge also flooded parts of the Anse la Raye Quarter, leading to officials declaring a mandatory evacuation of the area. On Montserrat, very little damage was reported. A few minor landslides occurred in rural areas; no impact was caused by them. On Nevis there was relatively little damage although the beachfront part of the Four Seasons Resort was severely damaged and was subsequently closed for an extended period. Throughout St. Kitts and Nevis, damage was estimated at $19 million. Aftermath Hurricane Omar passing through the alt=Colorized infrared satellite image of a hurricane. The storm, is in the top right portion of the image and has a poorly defined eye. A red mass, depicting strong convective activity, is present along the eastern side of the storm. The damage dealt to the agricultural sector of Antigua and Barbuda fueled major concerns for \\"food security\\" in 2009. The government allocated about $33,897,420 to help develop and repair the industry. Significant expansions of croplands were discussed, area, to help promote growth of the sector. On October 29, in the wake of Omar, President George W. Bush signed a major disaster declaration for the United States Virgin Islands, allowing public aid to assist the islands. The Federal Emergency Management Agency or FEMA, had received 60 requests for public assistance throughout the area. Monetary value for the assistance was estimated at $3 million and growing. Twenty-five departments and agencies were approved of for federal support, namely the U.S. V.I. Department of Public Works. Several non-profit organizations also received support from FEMA, while those that did not meet the criteria were referred to the Small Business Administration's low-interest loan program. On Dominica, Omar's close pass to the island left 30 families homeless and severely hampered the fishing community. On December 15, the Board of Directors of the Caribbean Development Bank approved $9.16 million for assistance to those affected by Omar on the island and to restore the infrastructure damaged by the hurricane. On December 18, the government of Dominica invested $4 million in aid for the fishing communities impacted by Omar. A total of 140 fishermen were provided with $250 per week for a total of four weeks. Sixty-two of which continued to receive funds due to their circumstances. The government also purchased 121 boat engines to distribute to fishers. Another $794,000 was spent to repair 47 boats and construct another 28 that had been damaged or destroyed by Omar. The government also bought replacement fishing gear.

Even before he became chancellor, he became a trusted advisor to Emperor Dezong, who greatly valued his opinion. However, eventually he offended Emperor Dezong by repeatedly accusing Emperor Dezong's associate Pei Yanling of misconduct, and he was demoted and died in exile. He left a relatively large body of writing on his advice to Emperor Dezong, which discussed in fair detail the condition of the Tang people at the time and thus is considered valuable, by historians such as the modern historian Bo Yang, in understanding mid-Tang life.See, e.g., Bo Yang Edition of the Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 56, preface.  Background  Lu Zhi was born in 754, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from Su Prefecture (蘇州, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu) and claimed ancestry from the royal house of the Warring States period state Qi, through officials of Han Dynasty, Eastern Wu, Jin Dynasty (265-420), Southern Qi, Liang Dynasty, and Chen Dynasty — although the family did not record the family line completely.New Book of Tang, vol. 73. Lu Zhi's biography in the Old Book of Tang gave his father's name as Lu Kan (陸侃) and indicated that Lu Kan had served as a county magistrate,Old Book of Tang, vol. 139 . while his biography in the New Book of Tang gave no name for his father,New Book of Tang, vol. 157 . while indicating, in its table of chancellors' family trees, that his grandfather was named Lu Qiwang (陸齊望) and served as the director of the archival bureau, while his father's name was Lu Ba (陸灞) and served as a low-level official at the ministry of civil service affairs. It was said that Lu Zhi lost his father early, and that he did not associate much with others. He was studious in his studies of Confucianism. When he was 17 (presumably 771, when Emperor Xuanzong's grandson Emperor Daizong was emperor), Lu passed the imperial examinations based on his knowledge and use of language, and was made the sheriff of Zheng County (鄭縣, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi). After his term of service was over, he was returning home to visit his mother, when he went through Shou Prefecture (壽州, in modern Lu'an, Anhui). The prefect of Shou Prefecture at the time was Zhang Yi (who would eventually be chancellor), and while Lu did not know Zhang, he went to visit Zhang to pay respect, because Zhang was well-known at the time. Zhang kept Lu at his mansion for three days and got to know him. He was impressed by Lu and asked for them to be considered friends, despite the difference in their age.As Zhang's birth year is not known, it is not known how much age difference there was. Zhang served as prefect of Shou Prefecture between 776 and 779, so the event must have occurred during that time. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 125 . When Lu was set to continue his journey, Zhang wanted to give him a large amount of money as a gift to his mother, but Lu declined, accepting only a gift of tea. Later, Lu was recalled to serve as a secretary at Weinan County (渭南, in modern Weinan), and later was made an imperial censor with the title Jiancha Yushi (監察御史).  Service under Emperor Dezong prior to chancellorship  Before Zhu Ci's rebellion = Meanwhile, Lu Zhi's abilities had drawn the attention of Emperor Daizong's crown prince Li Kuo. After Emperor Daizong died in 779 and Li Kuo ascended to the throne (as Emperor Dezong), he made Lu an imperial scholar (翰林學士, Hanlin Xueshi) and later Cibu Yuanwailang (祠部員外郎), a low-level official at the ministry of rites (禮部, Lǐbu); he also often sought advice from Lu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 228. It was said that Lu had a faithful character, and, thankful that Emperor Dezong valued him for his advice, wanted to repay Emperor Dezong by providing detailed and honest advice; in turn, Emperor Dezong came to trust his advice greatly. As of fall 783, with Emperor Dezong intending to reimpose imperial authority over a number of circuits which their military governors (Jiedushi) had long ruled in a de facto independent manner, imperial forces were locked into campaigns against several circuits in the Yellow River region — Pinglu (平盧, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong, then ruled by Li Na; Lulong (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing), then ruled by Zhu Tao; Weibo (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), then ruled by Tian Yue; and Hengji (恆冀, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei, then ruled by Wang Wujun — as well as Huaixi (淮西, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan), then ruled by Li Xilie. Lu submitted a petition to Emperor Dezong, pointing out that imperial forces were stretched thin, and the imperial treasury was being drained dangerously, causing Emperor Dezong's officials to increase tax levies and causing resentment from the people. He suggested that the most important project should be political reform, not military action, and that he should terminate the campaigns. Emperor Dezong did not accept his suggestions. = During Zhu Ci's rebellion = On November 2, 783,http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms- bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna;=%AD%F0&king;=%BCw%A9v&reign;=%AB%D8%A4%A4&yy;=4&ycanzi;=&mm;=10ⅆ=3&dcanzi;= soldiers from Jingyuan Circuit (涇原, headquartered in modern Pingliang, Gansu), at the capital Chang'an to await deployment to the wars in the east, were angry that they did not receive rewards they felt they deserved, and they mutinied, forcing Emperor Dezong to flee to Fengtian (奉天, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). Lu initially was unable to catch up with Emperor Dezong, but eventually did. Lu Zhi blamed the disaster on a number of high level officials, particularly the chancellor Lu Qi, whom Emperor Dezong greatly trusted, and when Emperor Dezong, wanting to deflect the criticism against Lu Qi, blamed the disaster on ill fortune instead, Lu Zhi submitted a lengthy statement as to how blaming ill fortune was dangerous for an emperor. Lu Zhi also advocated greater communication between Emperor Dezong and the officials, as a way to avoid having certain officials hiding the truth from the emperor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 229. Meanwhile, the Jingyuan soldiers supported Zhu Tao's brother Zhu Ci, himself an important general until Emperor Dezong removed him from his command due to Zhu Tao's rebellion, as their leader, and Zhu Ci soon declared himself the emperor of a new state of Qin. He put Fengtian under siege, but due to the efforts of the Tang general Li Huaiguang, Fengtian was saved, and Zhu Ci was forced to withdraw back to Chang'an. After the siege was lifted, two of the first promotions announced by Emperor Dezong went to Lu Zhi and his fellow imperial scholar Wu Tongwei (吳通微) (in Lu's case, to be Kaozhong Langzhong (考功郎中), a supervisorial official at the ministry of civil service affairs (吏部, Lìbu, note different tone than the ministry of rites). Lu declined on the basis that the officials who were most directly reporting to the emperor (as the imperial scholars were) should not be the ones receiving promotions first; rather, the promotions should go to the soldiers and military officers first. Emperor Dezong did not accept his refusal. While at Fengtian, Emperor Dezong sent messengers to try to get Wang Wujun, Tian Yue, and Li Na to resubmit to him. He was also planning on issuing a general pardon to help assure them, as well as their followers, that there would be no reprisals. He entrusted the drafting of the edict to Lu for wording that would touch the hearts of others. In spring 784, with Lu drafting the edict, Emperor Dezong issued a general pardon in which the emperor himself took the blame for the wars, offering to pardon all involved in resisting him except Zhu Ci. It was said that the wording was effective in causing the generals to turn their hearts, and soon thereafter, Wang, Tian, and Li Na, all of whom had declared themselves princes, shed their princely titles and resubmitted to Tang rule. While this was happening, however, Li Huaiguang, angry that Emperor Dezong had apparently distrusted him due to his severe criticism against Lu Qi (whom Emperor Dezong was forced to exile due to Li Huaiguang's demands), was plotting for rebellion himself, and he began to absorb the forces of other imperial generals in order to strengthen himself in preparation. Lu Zhi, seeing this, advocated peeling the armies that had been under other imperial generals away from Li Huaiguang generally, and it was said that it was due to Lu Zhi's advocacy that Li Sheng's army avoided being absorbed by Li Huaiguang. However, Emperor Dezong did not follow Lu's suggestion on also peeling the armies of Li Jianhui (李建徽) and Yang Huiyuan (楊惠元) away from Li Huaiguang's, and when Li Huaiguang rebelled soon thereafter, he seized Li Jianhui's and Yang's as well. As a result of Li Huaiguang's rebellion, Emperor Dezong was further forced to flee to Liang Prefecture (梁州, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi). During the flight to Liang Prefecture, Emperor Dezong became separated from Lu, and it was said that he panicked so much that he cried in fear, offering a great reward for someone who can locate Lu, and when Lu later met up with him, he was very pleased. However, it was also said that because Lu was so blunt in his suggestions, the suspicious Emperor Dezong was also offended by him; therefore, such officials as Liu Congyi and Lu's imperial scholar colleague Jiang Gongfu were named chancellors at the time, while Lu, whose opinions Emperor Dezong valued, was not named chancellor. While at Liang Prefecture, it was at Lu's suggestion that Emperor Dezong did not act against the general Li Chulin (李楚琳), who had previously been a rebel (under the reasoning that if Emperor Dezong did so, Li Chulin might rebel again and endanger imperial forces), but when Jiang was demoted for speaking against Emperor Dezong's building a pagoda for his deceased daughter Princess Tang'an, Lu's attempt to intercede for Jiang was ineffective in preventing Jiang from being demoted.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 230. Lu also greatly advocated against a proposed alliance with Tufan on account that Tufan had treacherously attacked Tang on many occasions in the past, and when Tufan forces withdrew from the field after first promising to attack Zhu Ci (who had renamed his state Han) together, Lu, instead of showing distress, wrote a congratulatory submission to Emperor Dezong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 231. = After Zhu Ci's rebellion = After Li Sheng recaptured Chang'an in summer 784 and Zhu Ci was killed in flight, Emperor Dezong returned to Chang'an, and Lu Zhi followed him. (On the way back to Chang'an, Emperor Dezong again considered replacing Li Chulin, but again per Lu's opinion did not do so.) Upon arrival in Chang'an, Emperor Dezong promoted Lu to be Zhongshu Sheren (中書舍人), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (中書省), but continued to have him serve as an imperial scholar. In 785, after Li Huaiguang, who had occupied Hezhong Circuit (河中, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), suffered repeated defeats at the hands of the Tang generals Ma Sui and Hun Jian, committed suicide, Lu suggested to Emperor Dezong that the next thing to do is to reassure the former rebel generals (who had all resubmitted to Tang by this point except for Li Xilie, who had claimed the title of emperor of Chu) that he did not intend reprisals, and Emperor Dezong issued an edict to that effect.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 232. Meanwhile, Emperor Dezong sent messengers to welcome Lu's mother Lady Wei to Chang'an, and treated her with great honors. Later, after Lady Wei died, Lu left governmental service and observed a period of mourning for her at the eastern capital Luoyang, staying at Fengle Temple (豐樂寺) at Mount Song. He refused all gifts sent to him in Lady Wei's honor, except for those from Wei Gao, the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu), because Wei Gao was an old friend. Because it was customary for husband and wife to be buried together, Emperor Dezong also had Lu's father disinterred and his casket escorted to Luoyang, to be buried with Lady Wei. After Lu's mourning period was over, he was recalled to the government to again serve as imperial scholar and also acting deputy minister of defense (兵部侍郎, Bingbu Shilang). He met with Emperor Dezong to thank the emperor, and was said to be so touched that he was prostrate on the ground, crying; Emperor Dezong was also touched by his display of emotions. It was said that the people at the time had great expectations that he would be chancellor, but the main chancellor at that time, Dou Can, was apprehensive of Lu. In 791, due to Dou's instigation, then, while Lu was officially made deputy minister of defense, he was stripped of his imperial scholar status.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 233. Meanwhile, Dou gained a reputation for treachery, and he began to lose Emperor Dezong's favor. In 792, Dou Can's nephew Dou Shen (竇申), fearful that Lu would be further promoted by Emperor Dezong, forged some documents defamatory to Lu with his maternal uncle Li Zezhi (李則之) the Prince of GuoNew Book of Tang, vol. 145 . and his ally, the imperial scholar Wu Tongxuan (吳通玄). Emperor Dezong found out about this and exiled Dou Shen, Li Zezhi, and Wu, and soon ordered Wu to commit suicide. Soon thereafter, Dou Can himself was exiled to be the secretary general at Chen Prefecture (郴州, in modern Chenzhou, Hunan), and Lu and Zhao Jing were named chancellors, with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (同中書門下平章事); both of them also given the office of Zhongshu Shilang (中書侍郎) as the deputy heads of the legislative bureau.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 234.  As chancellor  Soon after becoming chancellor, Lu Zhi advocated a system where the various supervising officials be allowed and required to recommend some capable subordinates for promotion. Emperor Dezong initially agreed, but after some time, believing reports that the officials were not recommending the right individuals, he wanted to end the system and return to the old system where the chancellors would select the officials for promotion. Lu opposed this reversion, pointing out that chancellors were formerly supervisorial officials and that it was not logical to believe that being given chancellor posts suddenly qualified them to select officials. Emperor Dezong, however, reverted to the old method anyway. Soon thereafter, when the military governor of Lingnan Circuit (嶺南, headquartered in modern Guangzhou, Guangdong) was complaining about the foreign merchants moving their businesses to Annan Circuit (安南, headquartered in modern Hanoi, Vietnam) and taking the substantial tax revenue away from LIngnan, Emperor Dezong considered agreeing with Lingnan's complaint and investigating the matter. Lu opposed this investigation, pointing out that both Lingnan and Annan were parts of the empire and that it must be that the Lingnan officials offended the foreign merchants by improperly exercising legal authority. It is not known whether Emperor Dezong agreed with Lu. Also in 792, after the director of finances, Ban Hong (班宏) died, Lu recommended Li Sun (李巽) to succeed Ban. Emperor Dezong initially agreed, but soon wanted to make Pei Yanling Ban's successor instead. Lu vehemently objected, arguing that Pei was frivolous and treacherous, but his arguments were to no avail, as Emperor Dezong soon made Pei the director of finances. Later in the year, when reports of a great flood that affected the regions between the Yellow River and the Yangtze River — some 40 prefectures — Emperor Dezong, initially believing that the reports were probably exaggerated, did not want to send special emissaries to comfort the people and to distribute aid, but at Lu's suggestion did so. He, however, wanted to omit Huaixi Circuit (which was then governed by Li Xilie's old subordinate Wu Shaocheng) from the emissaries' itineraries because Huaixi was not submitting tax revenues to the imperial treasury; Lu pointed out that even if Huaixi were inimical to the emperor that it should nevertheless receive aid, and Emperor Dezong agreed. Also in 792, Lu submitted a lengthy submission pointing out that the then-existing method for supplying food to the soldiers on the northern and western borders — shipping food from the Yangtze and Huai River region to supply then — was no longer making sense since, due to the flooding, the food prices in the Yangtze and Huai regions were much higher than the food prices in the northwest. He suggested that, instead, the government purchase local food in the northwest and use it to supply the army. Emperor Dezong agreed. Lu also pointed out that at the time, the military command system, where every single army reported directly to the emperor, was highly inefficient, and a command structure that gave more authority to the generals needed to be imposed. It is not known how Emperor Dezong reacted to his proposal. Meanwhile, Jiang Gongfu, who had long served as a member of the crown prince Li Song's staff, with few actual authorities, met Lu to ask for his help. Lu secretly responded: In fear, Jiang offered to resign and asked to become a Taoist monk. When Emperor Dezong inquired as to the reason and found out that he was fearful, he did not dare to state that Lu had told him this information, and instead claimed that Dou told him the information. Angry that his words had been leaked, Emperor Dezong demoted Jiang to be the secretary general of Quan Prefecture (泉州, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian), and sent imperial eunuch messengers to Dou, in exile, to rebuke him. In 793, Emperor Dezong sent eunuch messengers to Lu, secretly instructing him on several matters: that as for important matters, he should directly submit proposals to Emperor Dezong without first consulting Zhao; that he had heard reports that Miao Can (苗粲), the son of the deceased chancellor Miao Jinqing, had spoken words defamatory to Emperor Dezong, but because the matter was unclear, he wanted to make sure that Lu sent Miao Can and his brothers, all of whom shared names with ancient monarchs,Miao Can, who shared a name with the Han Zhao emperor Liu Can, had nine brothers — Miao Fa (苗發), who shared a name with King Wu of Zhou; Miao Pi (苗丕), who shared a name with the Former Qin emperor Fu Pi; Miao Jian (苗堅), who shared a name with Fu Pi's father Fu Jian; Miao Chui (苗垂), who shared a name with the Later Yan emperor Murong Chui; Miao Xiang (苗向), Miao Lü (苗呂), and Miao Wang (苗望), all of whom shared name components with the great Zhou Dynasty prime minister Jiang Ziya; Miao Ji (苗稷), who shared a name with the Zhou royal house's ancestor Hou Ji (后稷); and Miao Xian (苗咸), who did not appear to share a name with an ancient monarch. See New Book of Tang, vol. 140 . to posts with few authorities; and that he believed that Lu was being overly avoiding entanglement by refusing to accept any gifts. Lu wrote a lengthy response, pointing out, as to discussing the matters with Zhao, that chancellors properly should discuss important matters with each other; that, as to Miao Can's matter, that the law must be observed and where there was no evidence that Miao had carried out wrongdoing, it would be wrong to exile him based on innuendo; and, as to the matter of accepting gifts, that refusing all gifts was the best method to avoid appearance of favoritism. Meanwhile, Li Sun, who had been demoted previously by Dou Can but who was now Dou's superior, submitted accusations that Dou had accepted gifts from Liu Shining (劉士寧), the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan). Emperor Dezong, in anger, wanted to execute Dou, but Lu, pointing out that Dou's guilt was uncertain, argued that Dou should be spared. Emperor Dezong initially agreed, but soon still ordered Dou to commit suicide and confiscated his assets. (Despite Lu's submission, it was still commonly believed at the time that Lu had, due to his old rivalry with Dou, instigated Dou's death, causing Lu's reputation to suffer.) Also in 793, Zhao was made Menxia Shilang (門下侍郎), the deputy head of the examination bureau (門下省) instead of Zhongshu Shilang, but remained chancellor. Nevertheless, Zhao, believing this to be a plot by Lu to squeeze him out of power (since the office of the chancellor was within the legislative bureau), became resentful of Lu and often used illness as an excuse not to be involved in major decisions. In winter 793, Liu Shining, whose commission was not out of Emperor Dezong's own choice, was expelled by his own officer Li Wanrong (李萬榮). Lu advocated sending an imperial official to replace Liu as military governor, but Emperor Dezong, fearing a possible rebellion, made Li Wanrong the acting military governor, against Lu's advice. In 794, Lu proposed that some of the exiled officials be allowed to move closer to the capital. Emperor Dezong initially agreed, but became alarmed when he believed that Lu was moving them too close to the capital. Lu pointed out that Emperor Dezong's refusal to move them would mean that some highly talented officials would never get a chance to serve again, but it is not known how Emperor Dezong reacted to this. Lu also pointed out that Emperor Dezong was commissioning officials too much based on their ability to speak and as to whether he liked them or not, but Emperor Dezong refused to heed his advice. Lu further submitted a major six-point proposal to reform the taxation and land ownership system, believing that the then- existing system was becoming inequitable: # That the \\"two taxes\\" (兩稅) system at the time was encouraging the people to hide assets, and those whose assets could not be hidden (land owners or farmers) were bearing an inordinate amount of tax burden. # That the two taxes system, which also relied on a conversion formula of goods to cash, was using improper conversion formulas. (He proposed, instead, that the conversions be abolished, and that the taxes be collected in forms of food or textile directly.) # That the taxation system was causing the local officials to find ways to increase their locales' population, taxes, and irrigable lands, without regard for harm to other locales. # That the taxation deadlines were being arbitrarily set. # That the tea tax should be used to buy surplus food to be used in case of emergencies. # That the land rents that the large land owners were charging at the time was creating burdens too great for tenant farmers, and should be reduced. It is not clearly stated in history how Emperor Dezong reacted, but he appeared to reject Lu's proposal. Meanwhile, Lu was continuing to attack Pei for frivolousness, greed, and dishonesty, but Emperor Dezong, pleased with Pei that Pei was causing more money to be available to Emperor Dezong personally, was happy with Pei and thus displeased when Lu attacked him. Meanwhile, though, Lu, unaware that Zhao resented him, was often discussing these faults of Pei's with Zhao, and Zhao in turn alerted Pei as to how Lu was attacking him, allowing Pei to deflect the criticism when meeting Emperor Dezong. In winter 794, Lu was removed from his chancellor position and made an advisor to Li Song.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 235.  Exile  As soon as Lu Zhi was removed from his chancellor position, Pei Yanling begin attacking him as well as his allies Li Chong (李充), Zhang Pang (張滂), and Li Xian (李銛), accusing them of fostering dissent among the imperial guard ranks. When, subsequently, an imperial guard soldier did complain to Emperor Dezong that he was not receiving adequate supplies from the directory of finances, Emperor Dezong believed Pei's accusations, and in summer 795 demoted Lu, Li Chong, Zhang, and Li Xian all to be prefectural secretaries general — in Lu's case, to be the secretary general of Zhong Prefecture (忠州, in modern Chongqing). This caused Lu to be directly serving under an official that he had previously demoted, Li Jifu — who was the prefect of Zhong Prefecture. Lu's relatives and friends were all alarmed, fearful that Li Jifu would carry out reprisals. However, when Lu arrived in Zhong Prefecture, Li Jifu honored him as if he were still a chancellor, and while Lu initially feared that reprisals would come later, they eventually became close friends. Lu was at Zhong Prefecture for 10 years, and it was said that he often stayed at home; he did not handle official business much, nor did he write much, in fear that he would draw further disaster by doing so. Later, when Li Jifu was succeeded by one Xue Yan (薛延), Emperor Dezong sent a messenger to comfort Lu, showing still some respect for Lu. Wei Gao also repeatedly submitted petitions requesting that he be allowed to yield his position to Lu. After Emperor Dezong died in 805 and Li Song became emperor (as Emperor Shunzong), Emperor Shunzong issued an edict recalling Lu, along with three other officials that Emperor Dezong had exiled — Yang Cheng (陽城, who had been demoted for defending Lu), Zheng Yuqing, and Han Gao (韓皐). However, before the edict could arrive at Lu's and Yang's locations, they died.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 236. Lu was posthumously honored and given the posthumous name Xuan (宣, meaning \\"responsible\\").

It is commonly known as Conrad's false mussel or the dark false mussel. Identification It can look very similar to the zebra mussel, with similar stripes, but it can be distinguished from it by an apophysis or projection on the inside of the shell near the umbo. Shell length ranges between <1 and 2 cm, with an average length of 1 cm. Distribution This species is native in the Gulf of Mexico, as PDF and spread from there via ballast water, or attached to oysters that were moved, to the Hudson River in the 1930s, and from there to other estuaries in the eastern US including Chesapeake Bay Occurrence of this species in Chesapeake Bay and their role in filtration as well as to the Pernambuco coast in northeastern Brazil. This species also spread via ballast water to brackish waters in Europe, including the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea as well as the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Like the zebra mussel, this species is a significant biofouling pest in many countries, especially where it has been introduced in Europe. Habitat Mytilopsis leucophaeata is found in brackish water, at salinities ranging from 0.5 psu to about 12 psu, although its upper salinity limit is usually about 5–6 psu.

The arc is written by Jane Espenson, Steven S. DeKnight, Drew Z. Greenberg, Jim Krueger, Doug Petrie. PlotHarmonic Divergence (Issue #21)= In California, paparazzi witness Harmony Kendall drinking blood from a celebrity's neck outside a hot spot nightclub. Tabloids publish the photo of the biting, causing a world-wide stir of interest in vampires. Harmony uses this recent popular culture to land her own reality TV show with MTV. Soledad, a gang member, receives Slayer powers just in time to rescue herself from her old gang. She then turns down Andrew Wells and his offer to join the other Slayers, not wanting to join another gang. Despite this, she tracks down Harmony and attempts to slay her during a taping of the reality show 'Harmony Bites'. Soledad loses and is killed, which just increases the popularity of the show and the negative public image the Slayers now have. =Swell (Issue #22)= Satsu and Kennedy investigate the results of a four armed demon's theft. It had been trying to steal the prototype of a 'Vampy Cat Play Friend' toy, which was produced by the Santorio Corporation. The two also argue for the real reason Buffy sent Kennedy to Satsu. The doll turns out to be a living entity and turns Satsu into a caricature of a geisha, who mocks Kennedy's sexuality. Confused, the two manage to slay the creature. Investigating the company building, they find the staff dead and sucked dry of all bodily fluids. A shipment of Vampy Cat dolls is headed for Scotland, the Slayer's main HQ. The shipment is boarded and destroyed, with the assistance of a sub now under Slayer control. The creatures praise Twilight, a recurring villain, before their destruction. Harmony Kendall uses the incident to decry the 'backlash' against vampires. =Predators and Prey (Issue #23)= At the Scotland Slayer base, Andrew informs Buffy, Xander, and Willow that he has found Nisha, the lieutenant of the rogue Slayers led by Simone Doffler, outside of Milan. Nisha has been snared in a Ragna Spider's demon nest, so Buffy immediately arranges that she and Andrew head off to confront Nisha. However, when she is confronted, Nisha reveals that Andrew is responsible for breeding the extinct Ragna Spider demon back into existence, though with exceptional genetic modifications. As Andrew frees Nisha, he tries to defend his actions; as he and Buffy argue, Simone arrives by teleportation. Buffy is unsuccessful with convincing Simone to return with her and Simone teleports herself, Nisha, and the Ragna Spider away to an undisclosed location. As Buffy and Andrew track Simone via the radioactive isotopes Andrew equipped in the Ragna Spider, Buffy acknowledges that Andrew has come a long way and matured, but should have handled the situation differently, even if he feels responsible for Simone's rebellion. They locate Simone in an opera house on a coastal island, where Simone traps them and reveals she wants Andrew for the Ragna Spider; she wants revenge on him because he was her Watcher. However, Buffy engages and bests Simone in a fencing duel instead, which Simone responds to by pulling out a gun. Buffy surrenders, telling Simone that she can keep the Ranga Spider and that Buffy will leave her alone so long as Simone lets Buffy walk away with Andrew. However, before Simone can shoot, the Italy Squad arrives to rescue them. Buffy takes Simone's gun and shoots the Ragna Spider's cage, setting the demon loose on rogue Slayers while the Italy Squad evacuates. Back at their base of operations, Buffy tells Andrew that he should feel proud of what he has accomplished and how he was willing to lay down his life for the innocent and greater good. Andrew apologizes to Buffy for lying, and Buffy tells him to get used to screwing up for good reasons, he’s part of the family. =Safe (Issue #24)= Faith and Giles rescue an untrained Slayer named Courtney who had run away from her squad. Courtney informs them she was heading for a so-called Slayer Sanctuary in Hanselstadt, a safe zone for Slayers who do not wish to be chosen. The trio travel to the town, noting disturbing incidents. Vampires congregate on the border, obviously not invading for fear of the sanctuary, and the town seems to have no children. Giles hooks up with a former Watcher named Duncan Fillworthe while the Slayers go to the Sanctuary. Giles discovers that Duncan has gone mad and fed the children of the town to the demon that inhabits the seeming Sanctuary. Since the vampires fear the demon, the townspeople are convinced that the demon is a guardian of the town and willingly sacrificed children to the demon in exchange for keeping away the vampires. After all the children in the town had been fed to the demon, Duncan turned to feeding it the runaway Slayers. Giles saves Faith and Courtney from the threat, a monster that kills via the person's regrets. Duncan, who had followed, is killed when he regrets his complicity in the deaths. The vampires outside of town, now knowing the way is seemingly clear, mass for an attack. Giles and the Slayers swiftly organize an opposing army of adults. =Living Doll (Issue #25)= While the Summers sisters' relationship is still strained, Dawn goes missing as Buffy prepares the Slayer army against a vampire splinter army led by Judas Cradle. However, the ensuing battle ends quickly since Cradle's army consists of only six people and Buffy and Xander focus their attention on finding Dawn in the woods. To ascertain Dawn's possible whereabouts, Xander arranges for Andrew to find Dawn's thricewise ex-boyfriend Kenny at the University of California, Berkeley. Andrew poses as a college student interested in becoming Kenny's new roommate and sets up totems in Kenny's room that allow Willow to teleport the entire contents of Kenny's room to Scotland. However, when Kenny is confronted, he transforms into his demonic aspect and escapes into the nearby forest. Meanwhile, Dawn has undergone a third transformation - she has become a doll - and has been captured by Geppetto-like elderly man. Despite Dawn's attempts to escape, she is held back by other dolls made by the man, whom the dolls consider their father. The dollmaker tries to console Dawn by revealing he asked the other dolls to keep her from escaping to prevent her from breaking herself open and spilling her soul. Buffy and Xander eventually find the dollmaker's cottage, but Xander is soon rendered unconscious by poisoned darts and Buffy is assaulted by woodland creatures. Dawn makes another failed attempt to escape and as she cries out for Buffy to save her, Kenny bursts into the dollmaker's cottage. Upon seeing Kenny, Dawn apologizes to him, which reverses the effects of the spell, allowing her to become a human again. After Buffy threatens the dollmaker for detaining Dawn, she decides to leave him alone when his dolls intervene on his behalf. Dawn and Kenny talk about what happened between them and they both apologize for their actions, making amends and parting ways. Dawn reconciles with Buffy, who apologizes for not being there enough for her and that though she may have a thousand Slayers to lead, she only has one sister she loves. Production and writing Each individual issue was written by a different writer and each issue has a title instead of the overall story-arc title. The story-arc is a very loose one compared to the previous ones and each issue involves certain characters point of view of the over-all plot. Canonical issues This series has been described as 'canon' by both Whedon and various commentators. As the creator of Buffy, Joss Whedon's association with Buffyverse story is often linked to how canonical the various stories are. Since Whedon is writing this story, it will be seen as a continuation of the official continuity established by Buffy and Angel. Season Eight contradicts and supersedes information given in the paperback novels set after Season Seven, such as Queen of the Slayers and Dark Congress, which are described as being set in an unofficial \\"parallel continuity\\".Mata, Shiai, \\"CHRISTOPHER GOLDEN INTERVIEW 2 \\", SlayerLit.us (2007).

TypesIchthyosis hystrix, Curth-Macklin type= Edward Lambert, an Englishman who suffered from ichthyosis hystrix. The symptoms of ichthyosis hystrix Curth- Macklin are similar to epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (NPS-2 type) but there is no blistering and the hyperkeratosis is verrucous or spine-like. The hyperkeratosis is brown-grey in colour and is most obvious on the arms and legs. It is an autosomal dominant condition and can be caused by errors to the KRT1 gene. It is named after Helen Ollendorff Curth (1899-1982), a German- Jewish dermatologist, and Madge Thurlow Macklin (1893–1962), an American medical geneticist, and is one of the first syndromes named after two women. =Ichthyosis hystrix, Lambert type= Also known as ichthyosis hystrix gravior or porcupine man. This disease is characterised by spiny scales which cover the entire body except the face, genitals, palms and soles. The only known cases were in Edward Lambert (known as the porcupine man) who was exhibited in front of the Royal Society in London in 1731 and three generations of his descendants. No cases of this disease are now known though some experts believe that it may have been a type of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. From the history of the Lambert family the disease appears to have been an autosomal dominant condition. =Hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness syndrome= HID syndrome is also known as ichthyosis hystrix, Rheydt type after the German city of Rheydt near Düsseldorf where it was first discovered. Symptoms are bilateral hearing loss and spiky hyperkeratotic masses which cover the whole body though the palms and soles are less badly affected.

There are no pigment spots. The mantle is relatively large (35-40% of body length), with distinct grooves. The keel is prominent between mantle and posterior end.This article incorporates public domain text from the reference (\\"Species summary for Milax gagates\\". AnimalBase, last modified 30 December 2008, accessed 26 August 2010.) Skin sculpture is weak. There are 16-17 grooves between keel and pneumostome. The sole of the foot has blackish lateral zones and a lighter medial zone. Milax gagates is up to 50 mm long. Preserved specimen have a length of 25–30 mm and a width of 6–8 mm. The weight of adult slugs ranges from 991.2 mg to 3308.0 mg. Reproductive system: The penis is rounded, and half as long as the epiphallus. The epiphallus is slightly widened and truncated (as if cut off) at its end. the vas deferens is short (usually not longer than epiphallus), opens asymmetrically at the truncated end of the epiphallus. The atrium is short, and not widened. The accessory gland consist of several elongate glands and is connected to the atrium by some 20 short coiled tubular ducts. The stimulator is narrow, conical, slightly flattened at its end with some papillae. The stimulator of the similar species Milax nigricans has more papillae situated at its base and not near its free end. Distribution The native range of Milax gagates was originally from Morocco through Tunisia and southern Spain to southern France and the Balearic Islands. It is an endangered species in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. The species may be native to the Canary Islands. Milax gagates has been introduced in the area between Portugal and Galicia, the Atlantic coastlands of France to Belgium, the British Isles, and in many other areas almost worldwide (Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, Japan, Pacific islands, South Africa, Atlantic islands).

Invertebrate Reproduction and Development 54(3): 163-168. .  Ecology  Milax gagates lives mostly in cultivated areas, often the coast, and also in forests, shrublands, and natural meadows. It prefers habitats close to water. It hides under stones, moist ground litter and in soil cavities. It feeds on fresh herbs, including the roots, it can sometimes be a pest of crops such as carrots and potatoes. It is occasionally damaging to gardens and crops in Britain. It is an agricultural pest on soybean, sunflower, and oilseed rape in Argentina. In Britain copulation takes place during the period from spring to autumn. During copulation both slugs cling together so closely that no everted genitalia are visible. Under laboratory conditions, the first eggs are laid 5–15 days after copulation. At one time approximately 15 eggs are laid. This can be repeated several times, but in total not more than 100 eggs are laid by one individual. The dimensions of the eggs are 2 × 1.5 mm. Self-fertilization is also possible. The slug is semelparous, dying 15 to 30 days after laying eggs. Juveniles hatch after at least 25 to 30 days. Maturity is reached in 4 to 5 months under laboratory conditions.  References  * Spencer, H.G., Marshall, B.A. & Willan, R.C. (2009).

Strudwick has a PhD in sports science, which he earned from Liverpool John Moores University. Strudwick began his football career as a player with Colchester United, but did not make a first team appearance for the club. He gave up playing soon after and moved into coaching. He had previously worked with Coventry City, West Ham United and The Football Association before becoming one of Mark Hughes' first appointments when he took over as manager of Blackburn Rovers in 2004. Strudwick was at Blackburn for three seasons, before Manchester United approached him as a replacement for their outgoing fitness coach, Valter Di Salvo, in the summer of 2007. In April 2008, Strudwick was involved in an altercation between some of Manchester United's players, including Patrice Evra and Gary Neville, and the ground staff at Chelsea. During a warm-down led by Strudwick, it was claimed by Chelsea's head groundsman, Jason Griffin, that Strudwick had become abusive and foul-mouthed when asked not to warm down in the penalty area. Strudwick counter-claimed that Griffin had been less than polite in asking the players not to warm down in the penalty area, alleging that Griffin was \\"instantly aggressive\\" and that he had threatened him with a pitchfork. Strudwick reportedly damaged the wall of Manchester United's team dressing room at Wembley Stadium in April 2011, following their 1-0 FA Cup semi-final loss to Manchester City, after kicking out in anger when the players came in from the defeat. The club was fined for the repairs. In 2014, Strudwick joined the backroom staff of the England national football team for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. Following the arrival of new manager Louis van Gaal at United, it was reported that Strudwick and United masseur Rod Thornley were pulled back from their England duties to focus solely on their work at United. In September 2014, the club confirmed Jos van Dijk succeeded Strudwick as Manchester United's first-team fitness coach. Strudwick was appointed as the club's \\"head of athletic development\\", and would oversee the club's youth fitness.

The verb used in the question is simply echoed in the answer, negated if the answer has a negative truth-value. For example: * \\"Did you go to the cinema?\\" (or \\"Didn't you go to the cinema?\\") * \\"I did not.\\" or \\"I didn't go.\\" Finnish The Finnish language is one language that employs echo answers in response to yes-no questions. It does not answer them with either adverbs or interjections. So the answer to \\"Tuletteko kaupungista?\\" (\\"Are you coming from town?\\") is the verb form itself, \\"Tulemme\\" (\\"We are coming.\\"). Negatively phrased questions are answered similarly. Negative answers use the negative verb en in coordination with the infinitive. The negative answer to \\"Tunnetteko herra Lehdon?\\" (\\"Do you know Mr Lehto?\\") is \\"En tunne\\" (\\"I don't know.\\") or simply \\"En\\" (\\"I don't.\\"). Celtic languages The Celtic languages also primarily employ echo answers. Irish and Scottish Gaelic lack the words \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\" altogether. In Welsh, the words for \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\" (\\"ie\\" and \\"nage\\") are restricted to specialized circumstances. Like Finnish, the main way in these languages to state yes or no, to answer yes-no questions, is to echo the verb of the question. In Irish, the question \\"An dtiocfaidh tú?\\" (\\"Will you come?\\") will be answered with \\"Tiocfad\\" (\\"I will come\\") or \\"Ní thiocfad\\" (\\"I will not come\\"). (In Hiberno-English, it is the auxiliary that is echoed: the English question \\"Will you come?\\" is often answered in Ireland with \\"I will\\" instead of \\"Yes\\" or \\"I will not\\" instead of \\"no\\".) Similarly, in Welsh, the answers to \\"Ydy Fred yn dod?\\" (\\"Is Fred coming?\\") are \\"Ydy\\" (\\"He is\\") or \\"Nag ydy\\" (\\"He is not\\"). In general, the negative answer is the positive answer combined with \\"nag\\". As in Finnish, it avoids the issue of what an unadorned \\"yes\\" means in response to a negative question. A \\"yes\\" response to the question \\"You don't beat your wife?\\" is ambiguous in English, but the Welsh response \\"nag ydw\\" has no ambiguity. -- Jones' analysis of how to answer questions in the Welsh language, broken down into a typology of echo and non-echo responsives, polarity and truth-value responses, and numbers of forms Latin Although Latin has words for \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\", it also employs echo answers: * Nōnne Doofus molestus discipulus est? *: \\"Doofus is an annoying student, isn't he?\\" * Est. *: \\"He is.\\" * Num Doofus litterās memoriā tenēre potest? *: \\"Doofus cannot remember the alphabet, can he?\\" * Nōn potest. *: \\"He cannot.\\" Portuguese The Portuguese language is the only major Romance language to use echo answers often, even though it has words for \\"yes\\" and \\"no\\" proper (sim and não respectively) as well. Portuguese will most commonly answer a polar question in the affirmative by repeating the main verb. For example, one would answer the question, \\"Tens fome?\\" (\\"Are you hungry?\\" literally, \\"Do you have hunger?\\") by simply replying, \\"tenho\\" (\\"I have\\"). One could also add sim before or after the verb for the use of emphasis or to contradict a negative question, producing \\"sim, tenho\\" or \\"tenho sim\\". To produce a negative answer to a polar question, the verb is repeated followed by não before or after it. Thus, a negative answer to our above question would be: \\"Não tenho,\\" \\"Tenho não\\" or \\"Não tenho fome.\\" For emphasis, one could even say, \\"Não tenho, não.\\" Chinese Chinese languages often employ echo answers. Often, yes-no questions in Mandarin are expressed in the A-not-A form, and are answered with either A or not-A.Li, Charles N., and Thompson, Sandra A., Mandarin Chinese: A Functional Reference Grammar, Univ. of California Press, 1981.

PlotBackground= In Army Men I The Tan commander Plastro, invades the green lands. At the end, Sarge races the tan forces to a portal and enters, finding himself in a Kitchen. The game begins with a massive tan force including Plastro himself chasing him through the portal. Major Mylar betrays Plastro, destroys the portal as he enters it and takes control of the tan army and territories. =Levels= The game continues from the kitchen with Sarge and a small squad fighting their way across the kitchen counter, finding a portal back to the plastic Jungle (Level 1). Securing a radio installation, Sarge contacts HQ for instructions (Level 2), using which he wins a tank fight(Level 3), save a blue spy from the tan forces and escapes through an airfield(Level 4). In search for a missing colonel in plastic tropical islands, Sarge finds soldiers from all four armies banded together in what is called \\"the Cult\\". Colonel, gone mad, is found to be the leader of this cult (Level 5). He escapes through a portal and is followed by Sarge into a front yard where he is taken out by Sarge himself (Level 6). Sarge's plane is shot down into a plastic tropical island full of zombies created by Dr. Madd, an insane Grey scientist working for the Tan Army, who creates Cult forces by injecting different color liquids to soldiers. Sarge destroys the zombie mold factory generators (Level 7) and chases Dr. Madd to a desert where he must take out other scientists (Level 8). He then goes through another portal to a hobby table in a garage to stop several scientists from escaping back into the plastic world (Level 9). Through a portal he emerges at a forested, middle-of-nowhere tan base to fight the last enemy scientists protected by zombies, suicide bombers, etc. (Level 10) Sarge finally attacks the tan fortress, evades a massive wave of angry soldiers, rescues the blue spy, finds a key leading to a weapon of mass destruction located in the center of the fortress. bombs and destroys it before the tans use it, and goes out through a portal (Level 11) to Mylar's HQ in a child's bedroom, crawling with tan soldiers. He takes out Major Mylar on a fortress-like playset (Level 12). =Epilogue= In the closing movie, the greens swoop in, taking out the remaining tans and enjoying a major victory for the Green Army. On top of a nightstand or dresser, General Plastro can be seen spying on them.

It was apparently a religious shrine of the indigenous people living in the region long before the arrival of Europeans. The Incas conquered the area and incorporated it into their empire in the late 15th century. Following a common Inca policy, much of the local population was forcibly relocated to a distant province and replaced by colonies of non- locals, a process called mitma. El Quinche is one of the few places in Ecuador where a large amount of Inca pottery has been found, indicating its prominence as an Inca center.Bray, Tamara L. (Oct. 1992), \\"Archaeological Survey in Northern Highland Ecuador: Inca Imperialism and the Pais Caranqui,\\" World Archaeology, Vol. 24, No. 2, p. 220 The Incas built a temple over the indigenous huaca (shrine), and in turn the Spanish after conquering the area in the 1530s built a church over the Inca temple which became the shrine of El Quinche.Anderson, Amber Marie (2014), More than Forts: A study of high elevation enclosures within the Pambamarca Fortress Complex, Ecuador, Dissertation, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, p. 201 El Quinche was the southernmost settlement of what was called the Pais Caranqui, a group of northern Ecuadorian chiefdoms, which opposed the expansion of the Incas into their homelands. After conquering El Quinche, the Incas constructed a number of hilltop forts (pukaras) called the Pambamarca Fortress Complex north west of El Quinche to prosecute the war against the Cayambe people and other chiefdoms and also to protect El Quinche.

The units of SoH are percent points (100% = the battery's conditions match the battery's specifications). Typically, a battery's SoH will be 100% at the time of manufacture and will decrease over time and use. However, a battery's performance at the time of manufacture may not meet its specifications, in which case its initial SoH will be less than 100%. SoH evaluation * First, a battery management system evaluates the SoH of the battery under its management and reports it. * Then, the SoH is compared to a threshold (typically done by the application in which the battery is used), to determine the suitability of the battery to a given application. Knowing the SoH of a given battery and the SoH threshold of a given application: * a determination can be made whether the present battery conditions make it suitable for that application * an estimate can be made of the battery's useful lifetime in that application =Parameters= As SoH does not correspond to a particular physical quality, there is no consensus in the industry on how SoH should be determined. The designer of a battery management system may use any of the following parameters (singly or in combination) to derive an arbitrary value for the SoH. * Internal resistance / impedance / conductance * Capacity * Voltage * Self-discharge * Ability to accept a charge * Number of charge–discharge cycles * Age of the battery * Temperature of battery during its previous uses * Total energy charged and discharged In addition, the designer of the battery management system defines an arbitrary weight for each of the parameter's contribution to the SoH value. The definition of how SoH is evaluated can be a trade secret. SOH threshold As stated before, the method by which the battery management system evaluates the SoH of a battery is arbitrary. Similarly, the SoH threshold below which an application deems a particular battery unsuitable is also arbitrary; a given application may accept a battery with a SoH of 50% and above, while a more critical application may only accept batteries with a SoH of 90% and above.

A few years later James read an article that HGTV was being launched. He called Scripps Howard Broadcasting and asked for a meeting. James was told if he could get to their headquarters they would meet with him. He did and Gardening by the Yard was born. James' show explores topics familiar to the average home gardener, such as lawn care, growing vegetables, pruning trees, and instilling an interest in gardening in young people, in an informative yet light and irreverent style. Nearly all of his pre-2000 shows were filmed on his Tulsa property, and James produced most of the show's content himself. Later episodes usually included one or more segments by a respected lawn and garden expert and devoted more attention to organic gardening and topics that were more upscale or technical. All episodes of Gardening by the Yard made in 2000 or later were produced by Screaming Flea Productions. James took master gardener training in 1983. James is a married father of three with two delightful grandchildren. In addition to his work on Gardening by the Yard, James has hosted numerous HGTV specials, including a Rose Parade, as well as a short-lived cooking show (Paul James' Homegrown Cooking) that ran from 1998 to 2000. 2009 was the last year of Gardening by the Yard as the show was not renewed.

A plaque on the Wren Building, the college's first structure, ascribes the institution's origin to \\"the college proposed at Henrico.\\" It was named for the reigning joint monarchs of Great Britain, King William III and Queen Mary II. The selection of the new college's location on high ground at the center ridge of the Virginia Peninsula at the tiny community of Middle Plantation is credited to its first President, Reverend Dr. James Blair, who was also the Commissary of the Bishop of London in Virginia. A few years later, the favorable location and resources of the new school helped Dr. Blair and a committee of 5 students influence the House of Burgesses and Governor Francis Nicholson to move the capital there from Jamestown. The following year, 1699, the town was renamed Williamsburg. During the American Revolution about 75 years later, the college successfully made the transition from British support and a role in government and the established church under Bishop James Madison, and added professional programs including a School of Law under George Wythe. With buildings and finances both devastated by the American Civil War (1861–1865), through the perseverance of school presidents Benjamin Stoddert Ewell and Lyon Gardiner Tyler, funding from the U.S. Congress and the Commonwealth of Virginia eventually restored the infrastructure and facilitated expansion of the school's programs with a new emphasis on educating teachers for the state's new public school divisions. In 1918, William and Mary became the first of Virginia's state- supported colleges and universities to admit women as well as men to its under graduate programs. Adjacent to the restored colonial capital area which became Colonial Williamsburg beginning in 1926, the school has long been involved in the programs and work there. A few blocks away from the campus in the Historic Area, many students continue to attend Bruton Parish Church, a tradition of over 300 years duration. Prologue The first permanent settlement in the British Colony of Virginia was established at Jamestown in 1607 as a business venture funded by the Virginia Company of London and to replenish the British Crown Treasury. The role of the Protestant Church of England and its relationship to the monarchy government had been established in the 1530s by King Henry VIII, when he broke with the Papacy in Rome. In the Acts of Supremacy, Henry abandoned Rome completely, asserted the independence of the Ecclesia Anglicana and appointed himself and his successors as the supreme rulers of the English church. This sovereign relationship was later established when the original colony became an official royal colony in 1624. The primary leaders of the colony, from the Virginia Company of London, and the accompanying clergy believed they could bring Ecclesia Anglicana, the beliefs of the British Empire, to the Native Americans in the new colony. The spiritual beliefs of the Native Americans differed from the colonists and were incorrectly assumed by colonists as a lack of education and literacy, due to the indigenous Powhatan people who lived in the area, that they called \\"Tsenacommacah\\", which used Mesoamerican writing systems of petroglyph, pictogram and petroform.Native Americans in the United States#Society and art The colonists assumed teaching English literacy would result in what the English saw as enlightenment in civil and religious practices, and bring them into the fold as English subjects. In November 1618, the Virginia Company of London gave orders for university grounds to be laid at Henrico, 12 miles from the current city of Richmond, to include an Indian School branch, and endowed it with 10,000 acres of land. A school of higher education for both Native American young men and the sons of the colonists was one of the earliest goals of the leaders of the Virginia Colony. In May 1619, the treasurer of the Virginia Company, Sir Edwin Sandys, reported that funds had been collected toward the proposed college. The Virginia General Assembly, established July 30, 1619, proceeded on July 31, 1619, to petition the Virginia Company for workmen from England to build the college. In May 1620, the Virginia Company appointed George Thorpe (Virginia colonist) to be first deputy in charge of the college lands. Within the first decade, a promising start of a \\"university\\" was initiated as part of the progressive colonial outpost of Henricus under the leadership of Sir Thomas Dale. In March 1622, Thorpe was killed and Henrico destroyed, postponing the college, in an Indian uprising of the Indian Massacre of 1622. In 1624, the college plans were abandoned when the charter of the Virginia Company was revoked and Jamestown became a royal colony. It would be almost 70 more years before their efforts to establish a school of higher education would be successful. In 1661 the college and free school land purchase was authorized by an act passed by the General Assembly but no progress was made. By July 1690 the college was proposed again and subscriptions in Virginia were authorized by Lieutenant Governor Francis Nicholson with a financial support appeal to Virginia traders who were merchants in England. In May 1691 the General Assembly issued instructions for the founding of the college to Reverend James Blair, the representative of the Bishop of London, sending him to England to present the request to the King and Queen to grant a charter for the college.http://www.wm.edu/about/history/chronology/1618to1699/index.php Founding In 1691, with instruction from the House of Burgesses, Reverend Dr. James Blair, arrived in England to secure the charter to re-establish a school of higher education. Some scholars believe Blair utilized some of the original plans from the elaborate but ill-fated earlier attempt at Henricus. Reverend Blair, as the representative for the Bishop of London in the colony, journeyed to London. Control of the Native Americans of the Powhatan Confederacy was no longer a priority in the Colony, as they had been largely decimated and reduced to reservations after the last major conflict in 1644. However, establishing the Jamestown College and assimilating Native Americans in general was retained as a vital part of the school's mission, as possible moral and political incentives to help successfully gain approval in London. Henry Compton, the current Bishop of London, John Tillotson (Archbishop of Canterbury), and others supported Blair's assignment from the Virginia Colony to secure the charter for the college. The college was founded on February 8, 1693, under a royal charter (technically, by letters patent) granted by King William III and Queen Mary II, to establish the College of William and Mary in Virginia to \\"make, found and establish a certain Place of Universal Study, a perpetual College of Divinity, Philosophy, Languages, and the good arts and sciences...to be supported and maintained, in all time coming.\\" Named in honor of the reigning monarchs King William III and Queen Mary II, the college is the second oldest in the United States and was one of the original Colonial colleges. The Charter named Blair as the college's first president (a lifetime appointment which he held until his death in 1743). The king provided funds allocated from tobacco taxes, along with the Surveyor-General's Office \\"profits\\" and 10,000 acres each in the Pamunkey Neck and on Blackwater Swamp. Founded as an Anglican institution; governors were required to be members of the Church of England, and professors were required to declare adherence to the Thirty-Nine Articles.Webster, Homer J. (1902) \\"Schools and Colleges in Colonial Times,\\" The New England Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly, v. XXVII, p. 374, Google Books entry The charter called for a center of higher education consisting of three schools: the Grammar School, the Philosophy School and the Divinity School. The Philosophy School instructed students in the advanced study of moral philosophy (logic, rhetoric, ethics) as well as natural philosophy (physics, metaphysics and mathematics); upon completion of this coursework, the Divinity School prepared these young men for ordination into the Church of England. Reverend Dr. James Blair, founder of William & Mary This early curriculum, a precursor to the present-day liberal arts program, made William & Mary the first American college with a full faculty. The college has achieved many other notable academic firsts. Although most other planned goals were met or exceeded, the efforts to educate and convert the natives to Christianity were to prove less than successful once the college was established. Colonial history In November 1693, the College was given a seat in the House of Burgesses and the General Assembly passed the act to establish the College site \\"as near the church now standing in Middle Plantation old fields as convenience will permit\\", and on the same day voted on funding for the College to be supported by tobacco taxes and an export duty on furs and skins. \\"Middle Plantation\\" was changed to \\"Williamsburg\\" in 1699 when the colonial capital was moved there from Jamestown. The peaceful situation with the Native Americans in the Virginia Peninsula area by that time, as well as the central location in the developed portion of the colony located only about from Jamestown, but on high ground midway between the James and York Rivers, must have appealed to the College's first president, for he is credited with selecting a site for the new college on the western outskirts of the tiny community of Middle Plantation in James City County. In December 1693 a tract of was purchased from Captain Thomas Ballard, the proprietor of Rich Neck Plantation, in the amount of £170 for the College sitewilliamsburg hotel virginia busch garden at williamsburgpostcards.com just a short distance from the almost new brick Bruton Parish Church, a focal point of the extant community, and not far from the headwaters of Archer's Hope Creek, later renamed College Creek. The College library contains two of the boundary stones erected in 1694 that marked the property, which are available for viewing. In May 1694 the College of Arms in London granted The College's coat of arms, described as: \\"Vert a Colledge, or Edifice mason'd Argent in Chief a Sun rising Or the Hemisphere proper,\\" i.e., a college building in silver, on a green field; a golden sun at half orb against a blue sky. The new school opened in temporary buildings. Properly called the \\"College Building,\\" the first version of the Wren Building was built at Middle Plantation on a picturesque site. On August 8, 1695, the laying of the first foundation bricks, later called the Main Building, were attended by Governor Edmund Andros and the Council of Virginia. It was renamed the Sir Christopher Wren Building between 1928 and 1931 when it was restored. In 1700 the front and the north wing were completed. The present-day College still stands upon those grounds, adjacent to and just west of the restored historic area known in modern times as Colonial Williamsburg. After the statehouse at Jamestown burned in 1698, the legislature moved temporarily to Middle Plantation, as it had in the past. On May 1, 1699, the College held a May Day celebration, with the House of Burgess members in attendance by invitation of Governor Nicholson. On display for the Burgesses were examples \\"of the Improvement of your Youth in Learning and Education\\", along with five student speeches, including one extolling the advantages for the site of the capital as Williamsburg. The capital was permanently relocated there, and Middle Plantation was renamed Williamsburg in 1699. Following its designation as the Capital of the Colony, immediate provision was made for construction of a capitol building and for platting the new city according to the survey of Theodorick Bland. Both the extant Bruton Parish Church and the College Building held prominent locations in the new plan, with the Wren Building site aligned at the center of the western end of the new major central roadway, Duke of Gloucester Street, itself laid along a pathway running along the midpoint ridge of the Peninsula and long a dividing line between two of the original eight shires of Virginia, York and James City Counties. At the other (eastern) end of the Duke of Gloucester Street, opposite the College Building, the new Capitol was built. Williamsburg, which was granted a royal charter as a city in 1722, served as the capital of Colonial Virginia from 1699 to 1780. During this time, the College served as a law center and lawmakers frequently used its buildings. It educated future U.S. Presidents Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and John Tyler. The College issued George Washington his surveyor's certificate, which led to his first public office. Washington was later appointed the first American Chancellor in 1788 following the American Revolution. Serving as Chancellor of the College was to be his last public office, one he held until his death in 1799. George Wythe, America's first law professor George Wythe, widely regarded as a pioneer in American legal education, attended the College as a young man, but dropped out unable to afford the fees. Wythe went on to become one of the more distinguished jurists of his time. Jefferson, who later referred to Wythe as \\"my second father,\\" studied under Wythe from 1762 to 1767. By 1779, Wythe held the nation's first Law Professorship at the College. Wythe's other students included Henry Clay, James Monroe and John Marshall. The College also educated four U.S. Supreme Court Justices (John Marshall, John Blair, Philip Pendleton Barbour and Bushrod Washington) as well as several important members of government including Peyton Randolph and Henry Clay. Separation from England During the period of the American Revolution, Freedom of Religion and the Separation of Church and State were each established in Virginia beginning in 1776. The English government and the Church of England each lost prominence and control. While they desired independent government, leaders and citizens of the new state and country did not reject their church, only its structure in relationship to government. Worship continued during the difficult years of the War and thereafter. Although shorn of a governmental role and financial support, the Church survived in modified form as what is now known as The Episcopal Church (United States). Before the Revolution, there had been no bishop in the colony. After the War, the first Episcopal Bishop of Virginia was the Right Reverend James Madison (1749–1812). He was a cousin of future President of the United States James Madison, and was ordained in England just before the American Revolution. Future U.S. President James Madison was a key figure in the transition to religious freedom in Virginia, and Reverend Madison, his cousin and Thomas Jefferson, who was on the Board of Visitors, helped The College of William & Mary to make the transition as well, and to become a university with the establishment of the graduate schools in law and medicine in the process. A 1771 graduate of the College, and an ordained minister in the Church of England, Reverend James Madison was a teacher at William & Mary as the hostilities of the American Revolution broke out, and he organized his students into a local militia. During 1777, he served as chaplain of the Virginia House of Delegates. The same year, Loyalist sympathies of the College President, Reverend John Camm (who had been the initial litigant in the Parson's Cause case 1758-1764), brought about his removal from the faculty. Reverend Madison became the 8th president of The College of William & Mary in October, 1777, the first after separation from England. As its President, Reverend Madison worked with the new leaders of Virginia, most notably Jefferson, on a reorganization and changes for the College which included the abolition of the Divinity School and the Indian School, which was also known as the Brafferton School. The 1693 royal charter provided that Indian School of the College educate American Indian youth. College founder James Blair had arranged financing for that purpose using income from Brafferton Manor in Yorkshire, England, which had passed to the estate of scientist Robert Boyle. The Indian School, intended to \\"civilize\\" Indian youth, was begun in 1700. However, Native American parents resisted enrolling and boarding their children, and many of those who enrolled were captive children from enemy tribes, including the first six students. Enrollment was never strong, revived somewhat after construction of the fine brick Brafferton School building in 1723. The school was never very successful in achieving any quantity of Indian conversions to Christianity, but did help educate several generations of interpreters who could aid in communication. The school's dedicated income from England was interrupted by the Revolutionary War. By 1779, the Brafferton School had permanently closed, although \\"The Brafferton\\", as it is known in modern times, remains a landmark building on the campus. In June 1781, as British troops moved down the Peninsula, Lord Cornwallis made the president's house his headquarters, and the institution was closed for a few months of that year, which saw the surrender at Yorktown on October 19. Antebellum era 1776-1861 The colonies declared their independence in 1776 and the College of William & Mary severed formal ties to England. However, the College's connection to British history remains as a distinct point of pride; it maintains a relationship with the British monarchy and includes former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher among those who have served as Chancellors. Queen Elizabeth II has visited the College twice. In 1842, alumni of the College formed the Society of the Alumni which is now the sixth oldest alumni organization in the United States. In 1859, a great fire caused destruction to the College. The Alumni House is one of only several original antebellum structures remaining on campus; notable others include the Wren Building, the President's House, and the Brafferton. Slavery and William & Mary \\"From its founding in 1693 to the outbreak of the Civil War, the college owned, hired out, and rented slaves.... Professors such as Thomas Roderick Dew [William & Mary President 1836–1846] and Henry A. Washington argued that slavery was a benevolent institution serving a greater moral good.... Professors' and students' paternalistic defenses of slavery in the antebellum period left an important impact on racial struggles at the College of William & Mary.\\" President Dew, author of A Review of the Debates in the Legislature of 1831 and 1832, was the intellectual leader of the pro- slavery movement, and played a major role in ending the growing movement for liberating all of Virginia's slaves following Nat Turner's revolt of 1831. In 2009 the Board of Visitors \\"acknowledged that the university had owned and exploited slave labor from its founding to the Civil War; and that it had failed to take a stand against segregation during the Jim Crow Era.\\" With its support, the Lemon Project: A Journey of Reconciliation was founded. (Lemon is the name of a slave owned by the College.) \\"The Lemon Project is a multifaceted and dynamic attempt to rectify wrongs perpetrated against African Americans by William & Mary through action or inaction.\\" It is funded by the Office of the Provost. Starting in 2011, the Lemon Project hosts an annual symposium \\"on the past experiences of African-Americans in and around the College of William and Mary so as to provide a usable past for our future.\\" Civil War, Reconstruction, becoming a state institution College Building in 1859 At the outset of the American Civil War (1861–1865), enlistments in the Confederate Army depleted the student body and on May 10, 1861, the faculty voted to close the College for the duration of the conflict. The College Building was used as a Confederate barracks and later as a hospital, first by Confederate, and later Union forces. The Battle of Williamsburg was fought nearby during the Peninsula Campaign on May 5, 1862, and the city fell to the Union the next day. The Brafferton building of the College was used for a time as quarters for the commanding officer of the Union garrison occupying the town. On September 9, 1862, drunken soldiers of the 5th Pennsylvania Cavalry set fire to the College Building, purportedly in an attempt to prevent Confederate snipers from using it for cover. Much damage was done to the community during the Union occupation, which lasted until September 1865. Following the Union victory and the end of the Civil War, Virginia was destitute. The College's 16th president, Benjamin Stoddert Ewell, could only reopen the school in 1869 by using his personal funds. He later sought war reparations from the U.S. Congress, but he was repeatedly put off. Ewell's request was finally honored, and Federal funds were appropriated, but not until 1893. Meanwhile, after some years of struggling, the College closed in 1881 due to lack of funding. A legend has it that, every single morning of the seven-year period between the College's closure in 1881 and its reopening in 1888, President Ewell would arise and ring the bell calling students to class, so it could never be said that William & Mary had abandoned its mission to educate the young men of Virginia. In 1888, William & Mary resumed operations under a substitute charter, when the Commonwealth of Virginia passed an act appropriating $10,000 to establish a state normal school for white men at the College. Dr. Ewell, who had grown quite old and spent much of his private fortune attempting to reopen the College, was finally able to retire, with the future of his beloved College on a new and more stable course again. He was no doubt honored and satisfied that former U.S. President John Tyler's son would be taking the reins. 20th century: coeducational and teacher training programs Lyon Gardiner Tyler (1853–1935) became the 17th president of the College following President Ewell's retirement. Tyler began expanding the College into a modern institution. He assembled a faculty known affectionately as the \\"Seven Wise Men,\\" himself holding the chair of history. In March 1906 the General Assembly passed an act taking over the grounds of the colonial institution, and it has remained publicly supported ever since. In 1918, William & Mary was one of the first universities in Virginia to become coeducational with its admission of women. During this time, enrollment increased from 104 students in 1889 to 1269 students by 1932. Tyler retired in 1919 as president. Lyon Tyler was succeeded by the College's 18th president, J.A.C. Chandler, who continued and greatly expanded the initiatives of that began under Dr. Tyler. Also a historian and author, Dr. Chandler had spent his career prior to coming to William and Mary in education, and had developed an acclaimed \\"Model Schools\\" program at Richmond City Public Schools during the ten years he served there as Superintendent of Schools. Dr. Chandler was both innovative and energetic. As he continued programs of modernization and coeducation begun under Tyler, he had access to Tyler, who was still living nearby at his home in Charles City County. (Ironically, Dr. Tyler outlived Chandler by a year.) He also can be credited with the recruitment of Reverend Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin, who was comfortably serving a wealthy church in Rochester, New York, but as Dr. Chandler knew, still had strong ties and dreams for Williamsburg. Beginning ostensibly at William & Mary as an instructor and fund-raiser, Dr. Goodwin was soon pursuing historical restoration ideas and the funding for them, in addition to raising funds for the school's programs in general. The dedication of William & Mary's new Phi Beta Kappa Hall in 1926 gave Dr. Goodwin the opportunity to spend time with industrialist and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and his wife, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, as they visited Williamsburg with three of their children. Dr. Goodwin, who was also rector of Bruton Parish Church, shared his dreams and visions of restoring as much as possible of the \\"birthplace of America's democracy\\". While his father had been the hard-driving businessman who generated a lot of animosity around the country, as he was the \\"front man\\" for Standard Oil, his only son, John Jr., was a much more shy and reserved individual, whose became a philanthropist with his wife in handling the family's great wealth. Dr. Goodwin was successful, possibly beyond the wildest dreams of him or Dr. Chandler, in getting John and Abby to become part of the dream that ended up becoming Colonial Williamsburg (CW). Although most of the Restoration eventually came under a foundation separate from the College, the ties between the College and CW remain close. Notably the restorations/reconstructions of the Sir Christopher Wren Building, the President's House and the Brafferton (the President's office) between 1928 and 1932 were among what was accomplished on the campus itself which was of great benefit to the College Dr. Chandler had many activities going on in the 1920s other than the Restoration, which became increasingly Dr. Goodwin's principal focus. As a former public school leader, Dr. Chandler knew firsthand of the urgent need in the state for additional efforts to educate teachers and other professionals for the public schools throughout the state. Despite facing the challenges presented by the Great Depression and his own failing health as the College entered the 1930s, Chandler's greatest legacy at William and Mary is considered by many to be School of Education, which began a long continuing tradition of providing an education to many of Virginia's public school teachers. Although he had left local service there many years earlier, it is symbolic that Richmond Public Schools named a new school after Dr. Chandler shortly after his death, the only former W&M; President accorded such an honor in the capital city. During Dr. Chandler's 14-year tenure, the College's full- time faculty grew to over 100 and the student body grew from 300 to over 1200 students, despite the Depression. Affordable and accessible education was also a hallmark of Chandler's tenure. In 1930, William & Mary expanded its territorial range by establishing a branch in Norfolk, Virginia. This extension would eventually become the independent state-supported institution known as Old Dominion University. Other branches around the state were to follow. Partially as a result, when in competition for state higher education funding, the College has enjoyed an especially supportive relationship with the Virginia General Assembly, which partially funds the various local programs for K-12 public school education throughout the state. The School of Education has continued and expanded that commitment by conducting in-service training and summer programs which enable continuing education of teachers and other instructional personnel. As a result, many of Virginia's public school teachers who utilize these services later achieve masters and doctoral degrees, with some advancing to positions of leadership in school divisions or with the State Department of Education. Mid 1930s through WW II William and Mary's budding \\"Air School\\" begun under Dr. Chandler. The College had two different facilities during its short venture into aviation. Both were located originally along what is now VA-Route 603 (Mooretown Road). The newer facility changed to private operation and was the namesake for modern-day Airport Road in York County.http://www.airfields- freeman.com/VA/Airfields_VA_Hampton.htm#central The program was a casualty of a combination of the economic environment of the Depression, Dr. Chandler's failing health, and more than any other factor, most likely the changes in a growing technology which quickly shifted to the military and commercial sector. Significant campus construction continued under the College's nineteenth president, John Stewart Bryan. Son of Joseph Bryan, a prominent Richmonder, John Stewart was a newspaperman and businessman. As Virginia recovered from the Depression, in 1935, the Sunken Gardens were constructed, just west of the Wren Building. The sunken design is taken from a similar landscape feature at Chelsea Hospital in London, designed by Sir Christopher Wren. Post WW-II through modern times Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh visited the College on October 16, 1957, where the Queen spoke to the College community from the balcony of the Wren Building. The Queen again visited the College on May 4, 2007, as part of her state visit for the 400th anniversary of the establishment of the settlement at Jamestown. In 1974, Jay Winston Johns willed Ash Lawn-Highland, the historic Albemarle County, Virginia estate of alumnus and U.S. President James Monroe, to the College. The College restored this historic Presidential home near Charlottesville and opened it to the public. A decision in October 2006 by 26th President Gene Nichol regarding a cross in the Wren Building chapel resulted in the Wren Cross controversy. Citing concerns regarding religious pluralism, the cross was removed. After public outcry by members of the campus and alumni community, as well as coverage on the 700 Club by Pat Robertson, the cross was returned to the chapel. The cross is presently used liturgically by the Episcopal Canterbury and Catholic Campus Ministry. In 2018, Katherine Rowe replaced Taylor Reveley and became the first female president of the College after 325 years. As part of the 2019-2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the College cancelled all on-campus classes for a week in March 2020, with President Rowe later announcing the remainder of the semester would take place online and requesting students remain off campus. Sir Christopher Wren Building The Wren Building with a snow-covered statute of Lord Botetourt The building officially referred to as the \\"Sir Christopher Wren Building\\" was so named upon its renovation in 1931 to honor the English architect Sir Christopher Wren. The basis for the 1930s name is a 1724 history in which Hugh Jones stated that the 1699 design was \\"first modelled by Sir Christopher Wren\\" and then was adapted \\"by the Gentlemen there\\" in Virginia; little is known about how it looked, since it burned within a few years of its completion. It is unknown if Sir Christopher Wren did actually design the building, since he never stepped foot in North America. Today's Wren Building is based on the design of its 1716 replacement. The College's Alumni Association recently published an article suggesting that Wren's connection to the 1931 building is a viable subject of investigation. A follow-up letter clarified the apocryphal nature of the Wren connection. In the early 20th century, the Reverend Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin and John D. Rockefeller Jr. undertook a massive reconstruction and restoration project in Williamsburg--the project culminated in Colonial Williamsburg. The Wren Building was the first major building to be reconstructed or restored as part of the project. Following a drawing on the Bodleian copper plate (ca. 1740) and plans Thomas Jefferson drew of the interior in 1772, the Boston architectural firm of Perry, Shaw & Hepburn rebuilt the building to its second form (1715-1859). The architectural firm subsequently designed complete reconstructions of the Capitol and the Governor's Palace, the original versions of which had burned during the eighteenth century. Two other buildings around the Wren Building complete a triangle known as \\"Ancient Campus\\": the Brafferton (built in 1723 and originally housing the Indian School, now the President and Provost's offices) and the President's House (built in 1732). The Wren Building is the oldest educational building in continuous use in the United States, although it ceased to serve its original function several times over the centuries. The Wren Building was known in colonial times as \\"The College\\" because, in the early years of the institution, the entire College of William & Mary consisted solely of the Wren Building. Inside its hallowed walls, all students (males only at that time) lived, ate, studied, worshiped and learned. Firsts William & Mary is the second-oldest institution of higher learning in the United States, established in 1693 (Harvard is the oldest). The College was the first to teach Political Economy; Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations was a required textbook. In the reform of 1779, William & Mary became the first college in America to become a university, establishing faculties of law and medicine; it was also the first college to establish a chair of modern languages. Chemistry was taught beginning in the nineteenth century; alumnus and future Massachusetts Institute of Technology founder William Barton Rogers served as the College's Professor of Natural Philosophy and Chemistry from 1828 to 1835. Beginning with his 1778 Bill for the More General Diffusion of Knowledge, alumnus and future University of Virginia founder Thomas Jefferson was involved with efforts to secularize and reform the College's curriculum. Jefferson guided the College to adopt the nation's first elective system of study and to introduce the first student-adjudicated Honor System.However, a biographer notes that \\"Jefferson would one day sharply criticize William & Mary, and eventually he designed, built, and administered the University of Virginia in open opposition to his alma mater.\\" p. 40 Also at Jefferson's behest, the College appointed his friend and mentor George Wythe as the first Professor of Law in America in 1779. John Marshall, who would later go on to become Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, was one of Wythe's students. The College's Marshall-Wythe School of Law is the oldest law school in the United States. Along with establishment of new, firmer financial footing, the creation of the graduate schools in law and medicine officially made the \\"College\\" a school meeting the contemporary definition of a \\"university\\" by 1779, notwithstanding the retention of the original name as set forth in the 1693 Royal Charter. Secret societies The College of William and Mary has a rich tradition of secret societies and is home to the nation's first academic secret society, the Flat Hat Club. Although the pressures of the American Civil War forced many Societies to disappear, most of them were revived during the 20th Century. Some of the secret societies known to currently exist at the College are the Seven Society (Order of the Crown and Dagger), Wren Society, Bishop James Madison Society, Flat Hat Club, Alpha Club, The Society, 13 Club, the Spades, and W Society.Shhh! The Secret Side to the College’s Lesser Known Societies - The DoG Street Journal Peeking Into Closed Societies - The Flat Hat In addition to the popular culture notion of secret societies' wealth and extensive alumni networks, William and Mary's focus on the betterment of the College through philanthropy of a clandestine nature. John Heath and William Short (Class of 1779) founded the Phi Beta Kappa academic honor society at William & Mary on December 5, 1776, as a secret literary and philosophical society. Additional chapters were soon established at Yale and at Harvard, and there are now 270 chapters nationwide. Alumni John Marshall and Bushrod Washington were two of the earliest members of Phi Beta Kappa, elected in 1778 and 1780, respectively.name=\\"pbkabout\\" See also *List of The College of William & Mary presidents ReferencesExternal links * Historical Chronology of William and Mary * History & Traditions * University Archives Category:College of William & Mary William and Mary ","title":"History of the College of William &amp; Mary"},{"id":"20795018","text":"Orathy is a village in Madurantakam taluk, Kanchipuram District, Tamil Nadu, India.

History The original station was built in Delmar in the 1870s and the present structure was built for the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road) in 1905. The depot is a rectangular, single story, wood frame building built of a standard design for rural stations. There were waiting rooms (one for men and the other for women) at one end of the depot and a freight room at the other end. While this was not unusual in the Eastern United States, it was a unique design for the Midwest. In between the waiting rooms and the freight room was the station agent's office. Delmar owes its existence to railroads. with Three railroads converged there in the late 1870s and it was named Delmar Junction. Eventually, only the Milwaukee Road remained and was a strong influence on the development of the town. The depot was located on the Milwaukee Road's mainline from Chicago to Omaha. The depot remained in use until 1977. After that, it remained vacant until it was purchased by the City of Delmar. The last freight train used the station in 1982. Restoration of the building began in 1995, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. It now houses the Delmar Depot Museum, which contains a collection of over 1,500 historical items.

It was, aside from the pack-in game Cybermorph, the only launch title for the system in the region. It was also released in Europe on June 27, 1994 and finally in Japan on January 13, 1995 where it was published by Mumin Corporation. When the Crescent Galaxy has been conquered by a strange entity, the main armada units from the interplanetary defense squad Circle Reserves were dispatched but almost all of them were nearly destroyed when battling against it. Trevor McFur, a corporal from the reserve alongside his partner Cutter, warp to their home in order to counterattack the unknown entity, referred only as Odd-It and its own armada to free the planets and the galaxy from his graps, before it makes everything odd like himself. Being one of the first titles released for the system, Trevor McFur in the Crescent Galaxy is believed to have been originally in development for the unreleased Atari Panther console and was moved to the Jaguar when the project was terminated. Trevor McFur in the Crescent Galaxy received mixed reception when it launched from reviewers who praised the graphics but most of them were divided in regards to the gameplay and controls, while others criticized the lack of in- game music, lack of depth and sound effects. By April 1, 1995, the game had sold nearly 24,000 copies, though it is unknown how many were sold in total during its lifetime.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. Trevor McFur in the Crescent Galaxy is a horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up game where players take the role of corporal Trevor McFur from the Circle Reserves in a mission to defeat the entity known as Odd-It, by destroying the four moons orbiting around the planet Cosmolite in order to get into the main base of the enemy. The player has multiple continues to keep playing until they run out and the cartridge's EEPROM only saves high-scores and other settings. Unlike most of its contemporaries, the player can choose between any of the four starting moons and each one consists of two stages with a boss at the end of each stage. The player's ship has three types of weapons at his disposal: The main cannon, whose firepower can be increased up to six times, as with the bomb that can also be increased multiple times and the special weapon, which is activated by pressing the C button on the controller and they can also be changed for another special weapon by pressing Option, however, the player can also activate them at any given time by pressing their corresponding number on the controller's keypad. Pressing 9 brings Cutter to shoot the enemies and obstacles alongside the player. Power-up for the main cannon, bombs and special weapons are dropped by enemies and on every second stage, there is a Circle Reserves base, which grants power-ups as well. After each moon has been completed, the player is sent into a bonus stage where they fly between rings in order to get weapons and the stage is over once they crash into a ring. Extra lives are granted either by points or by finding their corresponding icons.  Plot  An area in the universe known as the Crescent Galaxy has fallen and the planets within the galaxy have been conquered, guarded by a blockade and put under the rule of an entity only referred as Odd-It, whose sole passion is to turn everything odd like it and now resides on the planet Cosmolite. The main armada in the Crescent Galaxy's chapter of the Interplanetary Defense Squad known as the Circle Reserves have nearly perished when they tried to battle against the entity. Trevor McFur, a corporal in the Circle Reserves along with his female feline partner Cutter, set their coordinates for home and engage at warp nine, seeking to overthrow Odd-It's regime on the planets he has attacked by his own armada. After destroying the four moons that surround Cosmolite, Trevor McFur and Cutter descent into Odd- It's main base on the planet. The two destroy it, saving the Crescent Galaxy in the process and both Trevor McFur and Cutter became household names for the Circle Reserves due to their efforts.Trevor McFur in the Crescent Galaxy game manual (Atari Jaguar, US)  Development and release  Originally codenamed Side Shooter early in development, Trevor McFur in the Crescent Galaxy was first showcased at Atari's August 1993 press conference at Sunnyvale, California in an early but playable state. A 1993 promotional recording sent by Atari to video game retail stores features the game in a much earlier state with many differences compared to the final release. Andrew Burgess, best known for his work in S.T.U.N. Runner, worked as a programmer and developed the game's sound engine. Andrew stated that the game was given a short deadline to get the project completed and meet the console's launch before other consoles were launched. He also stated that \\"the game was built on an evolving platform that was hard to program, with early development features, and a highly inexperienced game development organization at the time\\". B.J. West, who is more well known for the unreleased Atari Jaguar CD title Black ICE\\\\White Noise and his work as a graphic artist in The Sims, worked as an animator for various enemies and bosses in the game. It was one of his first works in the video game industry.  Reception  In their review of Trevor McFur in the Crescent Galaxy, Electronic Gaming Monthly commented \\"The graphics are very nice, but the game is not very challenging, not to mention the controller cramps your hand,\\" and gave it a 4 out of 10. GamePro panned the game, saying it has generally impressive graphics but shallow, primitive gameplay, elaborating that \\"You scroll side-view across open, flat, non- interactive backgrounds and shoot hordes of boring, redundant enemies. There is no variance to the speed, and little technique is needed other than moving fast and shooting the right objects\\".

The park was opened to the public in 1975. It was previously a privately owned family farm and later a hunting camp. Quail Hollow Park is open for year-round recreation and features trail that are open to hiking, mountain biking and cross-country skiing, a small pond for fishing and ice skating as well as group camping (advance reservation only) and picnic facilities. History The land in and around Quail Hollow Park was inhabited by various Indian tribes. The last tribe to call the area home before being forced out by the encroachment of Anglo-American settlers in the Ohio Country were the Lenape, also known as the Delaware. The first permanent settler in the area was Conrad Brumbaugh. He cleared some land and began farming in the area in 1820. The homestead remained in the Brumbaugh family until 1914, when it was purchased by Harry Bartlett Stewart. Stewart was the chairman of the board of the Akron, Canton and Youngstown Railroad. Initially the Stewarts used homestead for a hunting camp before eventually expanding the home and making their permanent residence on what they called the Minnie Taylor Farm, named for Mr. Stewart's wife, Minnie. Harry Stewart passed the land onto his son, Harry Bartlett Stewart, Jr. The Stewart's continued to improve the buildings on the Minnie Taylor farm. The original house was expanded into what they called a manor with Greek Revival and Federal architecture influences. The Stewarts remained at Minnie Taylor farm until 1975 when the sold it to the state of Ohio for half the appraised value. The land was purchased from the Stewarts with financial help from the United States Department of the Interior. Quail Hollow State Park was established on May 15, 1975. It became Quail Hollow Park in 2016, when the State of Ohio and the Stark County Park District made an agreement for Stark Parks to manage the park as part of the county park district. Ecology Quail Hollow Park is in a rich agricultural area. Northeast Ohio is part of the Interior Plains region of North America. The land is largely flat with a few hills that are a remnant of the last ice age. Small glacial lakes, known as kettle lakes are spread throughout the region. These lakes formed when the glaciers gouged out a depression in the land and large clumps of ice broke off the receding glaciers filling the holes and creating lakes. One of these kettle lakes has shrunk into what is best classified as a bog at Quail Hollow Park. This bog provides a habitat for and abundance of plants and wildlife. Poison sumac grows in the sphagnum bog. There is a remnant tall grass prairie in the park that supports sneezeweed, blazing star and various other prairie plants. The mixed tree forests of the park provide habitat for white-tailed deer, spring peepers, wild turkey, chorus and green frogs, raccoons, garter snakes, blue gill and red foxes. Recreation Quail Hollow Park is open for year-round recreation. There is a primitive campground that is open to large groups such as the Scouts and church youth groups. The campground is remote and is without running water or trash facilities. All water and trash must be carried in and out. The park has 19 miles of trails open to hiking, mountain biking and cross-country skiing. Careful observers will see some wildlife along the trail along with a variety of plant species. There are eight nature trails in the park. Quail Hollow Park has a five mile horse trail. Shady Lane Pond is open to fishing with a valid Ohio fishing license. The picnic area and playground are near Shady Lane Pond.

The film is the first spin-off film from the TV sitcom On the Buses and was followed by two further films, Mutiny on the Buses (1972) and Holiday on the Buses (1973). The films are set within a slightly different canon from the TV series: Stan and Jack work for a different bus company (Town & District instead of Luxton & District), and the three films form a loose story arc where Arthur and Olive become parents (despite their apparently sexless marriage). The film was produced by Ronald Chesney and Ronald Wolfe for Hammer Films, and enjoyed major success in Britain, outdoing Diamonds Are Forever to become the highest-grossing film of 1971. The tongue & cheek lyrics to the \\"On The Buses\\" film theme song were written by British pop song writer Roger Ferris also producing the recording at Abbey Road Studio's, Quinceharmon fine vocal performance secured a release on EMI's Columbia label. Synopsis Stan Butler (Reg Varney), a bus driver for the Town & District bus company, becomes worried that the overtime he is making – which his family is using to buy expensive items such as a washing machine – will soon end when the company rectifies its current lack of employees. His concerns become justified when the company decides to revoke a long-standing rule that prevents women from being employed as bus drivers, much to the chagrin of both Stan and his long-time colleague and friend, Jack (Bob Grant). The loss of overtime that he was making forces Stan to persuade his sister Olive (Anna Karen) to get employment in the company's canteen. Following a disastrous start, she and her husband, Arthur, soon discover that she is pregnant, resulting in her losing her job and forcing the Butler family to send back the items they can't afford to pay for. At the same time Stan gets into trouble with the company when, while attempting to recover something of Jack's from a woman he had been seeing, he manages to inadvertently demolish both a telephone kiosk and a bus shelter in trying to avoid being caught by the woman's jealous husband. Despite his efforts to lie about why he caused the damage, Blakey (Stephen Lewis), the bus company's Inspector, takes delight in informing Stan that he has to undertake a driving test on a bus skid pan in order to keep his job. However Blakey soon regrets supervising the test when Stan gets his own back by beginning the test with Blakey still on the bus being used for it. Stan manages to pass the test, but he soon becomes worried that the employment of women bus drivers will affect both his and Jack's layabout lifestyle at the company. It would also reduce their pay and prevent Jack from conducting amorous flings with women on the company's time. The pair decide that the best way to prevent this from happening is to sabotage the company's new employment scheme by making the women drivers look bad, and initially pull off small pranks. Later, when Stan witnesses Olive being terrified of a spider, he and Jack gather some to plant in the cabs of the women's buses, causing further disruption with their driving. These, however, have little effect, until Stan comes up with the idea of lacing their tea with a diuretic, upon learning of what it does when Olive acquires some for her pregnancy. This results in the women drivers being forced to make frequent loo stops while on their routes. As Olive's pregnancy draws closer to term, Arthur requests Stan's help in fixing the springs on his motorcycle's sidecar to prepare it for the trip to the hospital. While bringing the springs into the depot to get them fixed, amongst a few small things for the new baby, he and Jack discover that the company recently ordered a number of diversion signs to be made to reroute buses away from roadworks in town. Deciding to take advantage of this, the pair arrange for more to be made for their own use, then planting them out on the women's routes, thus causing even more trouble. One such false diversion causes a woman driver to get forced onto a motorway, causing her and Blakey, who was on board, to get in trouble with the police. A mishap occurs in getting her to the hospital, but Olive manages to give birth to a baby son; but the joyful arrival soon brings disruptions to the Butler household as they struggle to cope with the new child. Meanwhile, Stan and Jack are delighted to learn their sabotage efforts were a success when the company announces its decision to no longer employ women bus drivers. Their celebration however is short lived when they learn that Blakey re-hired the women drivers they tormented as inspectors, and they promptly separate the two onto different routes. Although the pair are not happy about this, Stan soon sees a silver lining to their situation when he is twinned with Sandra (Caroline Dowdeswell) a new attractive female clippie for his route. The story ends with Stan and Sandra managing to cause trouble to Blakey by knocking down a sign onto him and the other inspectors, much to Stan's delight as heads off to do his route.

The film is the second spin-off film from the TV sitcom On the Buses and succeeded On the Buses (1971). It was followed by a third film Holiday on the Buses (1973). The film was produced by Ronald Chesney and Ronald Wolfe for Hammer Films. Mutiny on the Buses came 17th in the 1972 box office. Plot Stan Butler (Reg Varney), a bus driver for the Town & District bus company, is so enamoured with a clippie from his company called Susy (Janet Mahoney), that he agrees to marry her. While Jack (Bob Grant), his close friend and colleague, welcomes the news, his family do not share the same view, with Stan's Mum (Doris Hare) unhappy that he will want to move out of the Butlers house. Although Stan is eager to get married and to find Susy a flat for them to live in, he is forced to put things on hold when he becomes the main money earner for the Butler household, after Arthur (Michael Robbins) loses his job. While trying to find his brother-in-law employment, Jack reveals news, overheard from Blakey (Stephen Lewis), the company's Bus Inspector, that a new manager by the name of Mr. Jenkins (Kevin Brennan) has been installed into the depot, who seeks to make the buses profitable and has intentions to make reforms at the depot to ensure its staff work harder, much to the dislike of Stan and Jack who enjoy their current layabout lifestyle. When Jenkins decides to stop the staff wearing casual, scruffy clothing under their uniform, Stan and Jack instigate a mutiny by having the male and female bus crews wear only the company's uniform that they are provided with, and nothing else. While this has little effect in stopping them having to wear smarter clothing with their uniforms, the stunt embarrasses Blakey and annoys Jenkins, who blames the Inspector for letting the staff get away with their prank. A few days later, Stan discovers that Jenkins is hiring new drivers and realises that this will provide the needed work for Arthur that can allow him to proceed with marrying Suzy. In order to ensure this, Stan decides to teach Arthur how to drive a bus. However, his plans to get him properly trained soon become threatened when Jenkins has a new radio control system installed in all the buses, allowing Blakey to ensure that the buses are running on time while keeping the pair working hard. Seeking to stop management interfering with how they want to work, Jack tampers with the system so that it crosses over into other radio frequencies, effectively leading to several misunderstandings before the police promptly order its discontinuation. Soon after the radio system is removed, Jenkins issues Blakey with a new van, in order to help him monitor the bus routes more effectively. However, when Stan and Jack accidentally cause a fire at the depot, the staff quickly find that the fire-fighting equipment is woefully inadequate, resulting in chaos that leads to the Inspector's new van being crushed between two buses whilst they are being moved out of the building. In the aftermath of the incident, Jenkins has the fire-fighting equipment upgraded and orders the Inspector to stage a fire drill, but this only leads to mayhem when Stan and Jack flood the depot after breaking the depot's new foam machine. At the same time, Arthur, who secured a job at the company, is horrified when Olive (Anna Karen) arrives at the depot during the mayhem, and crashes the motorbike in the flooded maintenance pit, after believing that her husband had lied about the fire drill. Despite Arthur now having a job, Stan discovers that he cannot afford a flat with the money he is earning, unless he can make more, and so is thrilled when Jenkins reveals to the bus crews that he is planning to arrange the company to run safari tours to Windsor Safari Park, whereupon the driver selected by him to drive the special bus for the tour will receive a larger wage and keep any tips they earn. However, any hope of Stan getting the job are dashed when Blakey informs him that, because both he and the depot manager agree that he is accountable for the mayhem with the fire drill, he will never be allowed to get the job. Later that evening, attending the company's dart competition in the busmen's canteen while debating on how to secure the safari job, trouble arises when he, Jack and Mum are forced to take Olive home, after she starts a fight with Arthur's clippie, Norah (Pat Ashton), for trying to flirt with her husband and getting more attention than herself. A couple of nights later, when they are in the depot after hours, Stan and Jack witness Jenkins having an affair with Norah and use the information to blackmail him into giving Stan the safari job, much to Blakey's shock. A few days later, Stan prepares for the first run - a trial run to determine if the safari park will accept buses on its ground. While Stan is delighted with the new uniform he is provided with, and the special safari bus he will be driving, he accidentally damages the bus' rear emergency exit, resulting in the trial run being a complete disaster when it leaves him and Blakey, assigned to supervise the run, at the mercy of lions and monkeys. With their engagement on the rocks following the incident, Stan persuades Suzy to come to his family's house for tea the following night to talk things over. But when it is announced that Olive is pregnant again, an annoyed Susy realises that she will never be married and storms out of the Butler household, giving back her engagement ring to Stan in the process. The next day, Stan finds out from Jack that Jenkins' wife learnt of his affair with Norah and had him transferred to another depot as a result, while also learning that his friend is no longer on his bus. Instead, he is shocked to discover that Blakey will be joining him, after being demoted to a conductor for all the trouble caused recently, but is delighted to learn that three new, attractive clippies have arrived at the depot, one of whom, Gloria (Jan Rennison), is being put on Stan's bus. The story ends with Blakey preventing passengers getting on Stan's bus, much like Jack did at the beginning, while Stan gets a feeling of Deja Vu when he finds himself agreeing to marry Gloria.

The film is the third and final spin- off film from the ITV sitcom On the Buses and succeeded the films On the Buses (1971) and Mutiny on the Buses (1972). The film was produced by Ronald Chesney and Ronald Wolfe for Hammer Films. Plot The negligent bus driving of Stan Butler (Reg Varney), a driver for the Town & District bus company, finally causes a major accident in the garage forecourt that injures Blakey (Stephen Lewis), while damaging the manager's car and wrecking two of the company's buses. As a result of this, both he and Blakey are sacked, along with Stan's close friend and conductor, Jack (Bob Grant). Forced to look for new jobs, Stan and Jack manage to secure work at a Pontins holiday camp in Prestatyn, North Wales, as a bus crew for its tour bus. But their joy is short-lived when they discover that Blakey, whose foot is still recovering, also has a job at the camp as its new security inspector. Despite this, Stan decides to invite his family to stay there for a holiday on his staff discount, though his tight-fisted brother-in-law, Arthur, refuses to pay for the train fare, instead relying on his motorcycle and sidecar to transport the Butler family, consisting of himself, Stan's Mum, his wife and Stan's sister Olive, and his son Little Arthur. However, a mishap while travelling to the camp leads to them losing most of their luggage in the river, while one case they recover is so filled with mud that the clothes inside are ruined. Meanwhile, as the Butler family try to begin enjoying their holiday, Blakey decides to keep a watchful eye on Stan and Jack as they get up to their usual tricks and misadventures, all while spending time with the camp's nurse, whom he loves, and using his spare time to teach an old-time dancing class to some of the camp's guests. At the same time, Mum encounters an Irish widower by the name of Bert (Wilfrid Brambell), whom she forms a close friendship with upon learning he is holidaying at the camp. While working the tour bus, Stan makes attempts to snare the affections of a female guest by the name of Mavis, but is repeatedly thwarted by her overbearing mother. When he does manage to secure some time with her, he becomes obliged by the family to babysit Little Arthur, but is so focused with Mavis, he inadvertently allows his nephew to get hold of a water pistol filled with ink that he soon sprays around one of the bedrooms of the Butler's chalet. Horrified, the Butlers become forced to redecorate the chalet before Blakey or the management find out. Seeking to make up for the disaster, Stan takes the family on a boat cruise, using it as a final attempt to seduce Mavis, but this fails when he struggles with the stormy seas, eventually succumbing to seasickness while Jack takes advantage to steal his love. Although the repainting goes well upon the Butler's return the paintwork is still wet requiring six hours to dry, as a result Olive ruins it during the night by leaving handprints over the painted walls while trying to find the room's light switch, forcing Arthur to redo the work the next day. Once finished, he decides to use petrol from his motorcycle to clean the brushes, yet in doing so, neglects to tell anyone that Olive poured it down the toilet, resulting in it being blown up when Stan carelessly discards a cigarette into it. Needing to repair the damage, Stan and Jack steal a new toilet from the camp's stores, while having Olive and Arthur join Blakey's old-time dancing class in order to divert the Inspector's attention. Olive however manages to break her glasses and because the toilet in their challet isnt finished she loses her way and winds up going into the wrong chalet and another man's bed by mistake. Shortly after repairing the damage, Stan attempts to win the affections of Maria, an Italian woman who works at the staff canteen and cleans the manager's chalet, unaware that her brother Luigi, a chef in the staff canteen, is overprotective of her, but on the night that he tries to seduce her in the manager's chalet, he is forced to hide when the manager and his wife return earlier than he expected. The next morning, Blakey jumps to conclusions about Stan's fling and informs Luigi of what he misheard, promptly leading Stan to be beaten up. However, the Inspector's joy is short- lived when Luigi angrily accuses him of lying, after the manager, unaware of the truth, reveals that no such amorous event occurred in his chalet. Later that day in the nurses office, after Stan had been seen to after his injuries received in the beat-up, Jack visits the nurse for a quick fling, having been doing so behind Blakey's back, but is forced to leave when he comes to see her, accidentally leaving behind his jacket in her office. When the Inspector finds them, he wrongly believes Stan is seeing her and, in a fit of rage, chases him. This proves to be the final straw for the manager who sacks Blakey for having romantic liaisons with the nurse against staff policies. For the Butler family, their holiday ends with reasonable success despite the mishaps, though as they return home, they suffer one more mishap when they lose their luggage once again in the same river (mainly thanks to Olive). Meanwhile, Stan and Jack, delighted that Blakey is now gone, set their sights on two new female guests, and borrow the bus for an evening trip to the beach. However, the pair panic when the bus sinks into wet sand and cannot be moved, leading them to decide to wait until morning to try moving it again. When they first returned to move the bus they found that the tide was partly in and believing the tide was going out chose to return an hour later, this later decision however leads to the bus being completely submerged by the tide and the pair are promptly sacked for their actions. Left on the dole again Stan and Jack return to the labour exchange for new jobs, only to find that Blakey to their horror is now a clerk at the exchange. Although he initially gloats over Stan's predicament, he eventually provides him a job appropriate for someone who is \\"always smashing things up\\". The story ends with Stan as the driver of a wrecking ball for a demolition company, bringing down a building.

Submerged Forests. The Cambridge Manuals of Science and Literature, Cambridge University Press, 129 pp. A submerged forest is the in situ remains of trees (especially tree stumps) that lie submerged beneath a bay, sea, ocean, lake, or other body of water. These remains have usually been buried in mud, peat or sand for several thousand years before being uncovered by sea level change and erosion and have been preserved in the compacted sediment by the exclusion of oxygen. A forest can become submerged as the result of a lake or sea level rise that results in a lacustrine or marine transgression and in-place drowning of the forest. A submerged forest that lies beneath a lake can also be formed by the blockage of a river valley by either a landslide or manmade dam.  Examples  Marine submerged forests may be regularly exposed at low tide; examples of these can be found at low tide on the fringes of the submerged landmass known as Doggerland, around the coast of England and the coasts of Wales, the Channel Islands, north-west France and Denmark. In some places, such as Blackpool Sands, Dartmouth, the remains are normally covered by sand and only rarely exposed. During the storms of 1974 (see Penparcau) Evans, J.G., Limbrey, S. and Cleere, H.

As the North American Laurentide Ice Sheet began receding for the last time some 10,000 years ago, water levels in the future Great Lakes were sometimes much lower than at present. Forests once covered the southern end of what is now Lake Huron but as the glaciers melted and waters rose these forests were inundated and drowned. Today their remnants, well preserved logs and stumps, have been discovered in waters over 200 feet deep. Another submerged forest has been found in Nantucket Sound, off the coast of Massachusetts. and in 2012 a submerged bald cypress forest, which has been dated at around 50,000 years old, was discovered in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Alabama.

An early epidemiologist, Orreus distinguished himself during the Russian plague of 1770–72. He was the first Doctor of Medicine ever to qualify in Russia.Melikishvili, Annex: p. 8 Biography Born in Finland (then part of Sweden), Orreus was trained at Åbo and relocated to Russia in 1755. He continued medical training in Moscow and is believed to have taken part in the Seven Years' War. On August 2, 1768 Catherine II of Russia awarded him the Doctor of Medicine diploma, the first of its kind ever issued in Russia. In the same year Orreus became a surgeon at Pyotr Rumyantsev's headquarters in the Moldavian theater of the 1768-1774 Russo- Turkish War. The southern provinces of Moldavia and Wallachia were infested with plague. Orreus, in charge of disease prevention, persuaded the generals that the disease was indeed plague and not \\"malignant fever\\"; he set up basic reconnaissance for plague outbreaks and imposed anti-plague controls that are credited with preventing widespread disease among the troops.Klyuzhev et al., p. 52 However the plague infiltrated mainland Russia, causing the epidemic of 1770–72 that peaked in Moscow in September and October 1771.Melikishvili, pp. 24-27, provides a historical summary of the epidemic. Orreus was summoned to Moscow by Grigory Orlov, the statesman placed in charge of emergency anti- plague action. Orlov and Orreus arrived in the city September 26, 1771, at the peak of the outbreak.Melikishvili, p. 25 Orreus was assigned to manage quarantine hospitals in Moscow. At first, he opposed Afanasy Shafonsky and denied the plague nature of the Moscow epidemic, but despite bitter medical dispute the course of events persuaded Orreus to admit the facts. He summarized his experience during the plague in a 1784 treatise Descriptio pestis, quae anno 1770 in Jassia et 1771 in Moscua grassata est (A Description of Plague that Ravaged Iaşi in 1770 and Moscow in 1771). In 1776 Orreus retired from state service and settled on his estate near Saint Petersburg. His experiments with agricultural novelties were publicized in the Proceeds of the Free Economic Society. He also authored A Brief Essay on Fever, Diarrhea and Bloody Flux and other Diseases Prevalent among Soldiers, printed in the Russian language at Saint Petersburg in 1808.

She is an attending physician with a mysterious past with County General. Bassett's addition into the main cast opening credits was in the 2nd episode of season 15.  Life at County and Career  Banfield was hired in 2008 to become the permanent Chief of the Emergency Department, replacing Dr. Skye Wexler who was serving as acting chief. The board had decided to offer the permanent position to Dr. Gregory Pratt, but with Pratt's death, Banfield was brought in as his replacement. She first appeared in the second episode of Season 15 and immediately puts the whole ER on edge with her tough attitude. It was mentioned that she flew to Indonesia to help that country deal with the 2004 tsunami disaster. On her first day, Nurse Haleh mentioned Banfield looked familiar as if she's been at County before, which Banfield immediately denies. Her first day as Chief tested her skills as an able and efficient leader when a bio-terrorist released a bag of weaponized Ricin in the ER, necessitating an evacuation and quarantine. She briefly met and clashed over a gunshot case with Abby Lockhart, who was finishing her last shift on her last day at County General. Nonetheless, Banfield made amends with her new acquaintance before Abby departed for Boston. In the episode \\"Heal Thyself\\", the treatment of a little girl who almost drowned in the Chicago River triggered painful memories, yet in the end it helped Banfield figure out how to save the girl from a certain death, thereby in her mind redeeming herself from the mistakes she made with her son Darryl. Later in Season 15, Cate and Archie Morris get snowed in at a conference in Omaha. Banfield ends up getting drunk and makes a wild scene of entertainment in the hotel lobby. She smiles and actually laughs for the first time (probably the first time since before the accident). The two end up having to share a room together before flying back to Chicago. Cate begins to open up more to Morris how they tried to have another baby a few years back but miscarried.  Early life  In the Season 15 episode \\"Heal Thyself\\", the audience begins to learn about Cate Banfield's haunting past and how her experiences have damaged her emotionally. Set in 2002, 6 years earlier, the flashback episode revealed a happier Cate Banfield with her husband Russell (played by Bassett's real life husband, actor Courtney B. Vance) and their 5-year-old son Darryl. Banfield had a more youthful look with longer black hair. She is smiling, which was never seen by the show's audiences until this point. In this episode, she stated to Dr. Greene that she worked as an ER attending physician at the University of Chicago. She went to medical school at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.\\"Separation Anxiety\\". ER. Season 15. Episode 11. During a day out in the city park, Darryl was struck with a mysterious seizure. Cate at first didn't see it as anything serious and argued against calling 9-1-1, even though her husband Russell insisted. After Darryl began vomiting blood, Cate brought him to County General and was diagnosed by Dr. Mark Greene in Trauma 1. Darryl had acute leukemia, and died from advanced complications that arose with his illness. Cate's initial denial and delay contributed to one of the factors that led to Dr. Greene not being able to save Darryl. This explains how Nurse Haleh had recognized her before and the chilling moment Banfield had on her first day stepping into Trauma 1. In the last scene of the episode, Banfield and Greene talk about what happened near the Chicago River and how the ordeal proved to be completely damaging in Cate's mind and to her relationship with her husband.  Personal life  In the present day in the episode \\"Heal Thyself\\" after Darryl's death, Cate lay in Darryl's empty room, where her husband Russell tells her how he never blamed her for what happened, and Cate cries for the first time over her son's death. Morris is stunned to learn that Cate is working at the hospital where her son died. Later in the season Cate has an appointment with Janet Coburn from O.B. since she and Russell decide they want to try for a baby one last time, even though Coburn tells them the chances are slim. Cate begins to take special injections of hormones to help with her chances in the process and tries to remain hopeful over all the odds, but she and Russell are devastated when the egg implantation process has zero success. Later in the season a mother abandons a baby at County with whom Cate bonds. She convinces Russell that they should adopt the baby. When in the penultimate episode the mother arrives to take him back, Cate convinces her to let her and Russell openly adopt the child.

Meanwhile, he was unbeatable domestically, winning the Soviet Greco-Roman heavyweight title in 1940, 1943–46, 1948, 1950–53 and 1955–56, and placing second in 1949 and 1954.

Background Almond Roca was invented in 1912 by Harry Brown and J. C. Haley, founders of Brown & Haley Company.http://www.topsecretrecipes.com/Brown-and-Haley-Almond- Roca-Copycat-Recipe.html The candy's name is said to have been inspired by Tacoma's head librarian, Jacqueline Noel, who chose the Spanish word \\"roca\\", meaning \\"rock\\" in English, to describe the hard, log-shaped confection. Brown & Haley first used Almond Roca's trademark pink tin can containers in 1927 to extend the product's shelf life. Individual pieces of Almond Roca candy are wrapped in gold-colored aluminum foil. In 2009, the Washington state legislature attempted to designate Aplets & Cotlets the \\"official candy of the state of Washington\\". The proposal ultimately failed; some legislators from Western Washington thought the designation should go to Almond Roca.  Ingredients  Almond Roca contains sugar, almonds, butter, palm oil, palm kernel oil, cocoa powder, whey, skim milk powder, soya lecithin, chocolate, and vanilla. By company tradition, a small amount of the original 1923 batch of toffee is carried over into each subsequent batch of candy. Empirical studies have shown that the chocolate and almond coating of the candy includes the equivalent of two average sized almonds.

Balachander starring Jayasudha, Kamal Haasan, Sarath Babu, Chiranjeevi, Saritha, and Rama Prabha. It is a remake of Balachander's own Tamil film Avargal (1977). Jayasudha reprised the role of Sujatha in the original. Kamal Haasan starred in the same role in both languages. This film also had Chiranjeevi as the villainous husband of Jayasudha (Rajinikanth starred as the husband in Tamil). The film was shot in Black and white. Jayasudha won the Nandi Award for Best Actress.  Plot  The movie revolves around the trials and tribulations of Suhasini (Jayasudha). Suhasini is a happy-go-lucky girl head-over-heels in love with her boyfriend Bharani (Sarath Babu). Her life changes when her father gets transferred to Mumbai (then Bombay). Her love life falls apart as Bharani doesn't respond to any of her letters. In addition, her father becomes seriously ill. Her father's office colleague, Sugunakar Rao (Chiranjeevi), becomes a great source of strength for her in these tough times. Soon, he asks for her hand in marriage. She accepts gratefully and confesses that she had a boyfriend, who has seemingly forgotten her. However, she soon realizes the truth about Sugunakar Rao. He is a sadistic and jealous husband, who tortures her no end and, not unsurprisingly, she opts for a divorce. As a divorced woman, with an infant in her hands, she lands in Chennai (then Madras) to take up a new job and start a new life. Her life takes a turn for the better in Chennai as she has a very supportive friend group in her office, particularly a widower, Janardhan aka Johnny (Kamal Hassan). Johnny, a talented ventriloquist who \\"talks\\" through his puppet, Junior. He falls in love with Suhasini but is unable to muster up the courage to tell her about it. In an interesting cinematic twist, her ex- husband's mother discovers her presence in the city and takes up a job as a maid in her house. Suhasini also stumbles upon Bharani in Chennai and discovers that her letters to him never reached as they were intercepted by his mentally-challenged sister. Soon, Suhasini renews her relationship with Bharani and life seems to be looking up for her. But the ghosts of the past continue to haunt her. Sugunakar Rao comes to Chennai in the role of her boss – a contrite and repentant Sugunakar, who now wants to remarry Suhasini and redress the wrongs he had done. The situation becomes piquant with 3 men vying for Suhasini – her ex-love, her ex-husband and a silent lover lurking on the sidelines. In the later part of the movie, Suhasini realises that Sugunakar is just trying to destroy her life and Bharani too is now interested in another girl due to her inability to take a decision about their marriage. In the end, she decides to shift to different city to start a new life and Johnny helps her in that and says that he is always waiting for her. Her Mother-in-law too accompanies her to look after her grandson and thus they plan to start a new life.

The AWBF was founded to help women's baseball teams around the country network through its website and the tournaments it has organized. The AWBF is an assumed name for the American Women's Baseball League. Its National Championship Tournament is hosted in Huntingburg, Indiana and featured Donna Mills in 2009. Julie Croteau and her former Colorado Silver Bullets teammates have also been affiliated with the organization. Since 1992 the AWBF has organized 17 regional and national tournaments. With international partner Women's Baseball Association of Japan (WBAJ) it organized the first four Women's World Series events. National teams met in Canada (2001), United States (2002), Australia (2003) and Japan (2004) to play for international bragging rights. The Women's World Series events were the precursors to the Women's World Cup of Baseball. The Women's World Cup of Baseball started in 2004 in Edmonton and involved most of the same teams that participated in the 2004 Women's World Series. The Women's World Cup of Baseball is now the top elite women's baseball tournament in the world. The Women's World Series is no longer played. The AWBF now keeps a database of players interested in trying out for the USA Baseball women's national team. Interested players are directed to tryout sites and their names are sent to USA Baseball which holds tryouts and select a women's national team each year. Jim Glennie is the Founder of the AWBF and served as Director of Player Identification for the USA Baseball Women's National Team and started the foundation after his daughter started playing baseball.

Distributed mode loudspeakers function differently from most others, which typically produce sound by inducing pistonic motion in the diaphragm. Exciters for distributed mode loudspeakers include, but are not limited to, moving coil and piezoelectric devices, and are placed to correspond to the natural resonant model of the panel. Applications NXT licenses two classes of distributed mode loudspeaker: SurfaceSound for traditional flat-panel applications, and SoundVu for applications in which sound is produced directly in front of the display (either through a projection screen which functions as a DML or a transparent DML overlaid on the display). SurfaceSound technology has been incorporated into a number of novel products such as school equipment, portable folding cardboard speakers (SoundpaX, an OEM product manufactured by a number of different companies), and high-end musical greeting cards. Aside from projection screens, SoundVu has been integrated into computer and mobile phone displays. NXT also licenses the Balanced Mode Radiator (BMR), a hybrid technology that blends DML technology with that of traditional pistonic-action loudspeakers. According to NXT, the resultant speakers feature the low-frequency performance of a traditional loudspeaker, but with a wider directivity and shallower profile, as well as the mid-range and high-frequency performance of a DML. The two types of BMR offered are: the Audio Full Range (AFR), a full-range optimized circular speaker; and the High Aspect Ratio Panel (HARP), a long and thin form factor for use in narrower spaces. DML exciters are compatible with traditional amplifiers. Initial testing by researchers at the Delft University of Technology concluded that DML panels are good potential candidates for use in wave field synthesis applications, as they are light and can be placed close to walls. Purported advantages and disadvantagesAdvantages= *Broad frequency range (100 – 18000 Hz for 0.6m2 panel). *The air radiation resistance is small and constant with frequency. This means that directivity is not affected by size of speaker. *Bipolar (radiates sound in 2 directions), but may be made forward directed. *Flat, don't require enclosing, may be produced in different shapes, may be decorated etc. Some DML units are designed to be plastered into walls and completely hidden. *Low cost of materials relative to traditional loudspeaker designs. =Disadvantages= *Problems radiating low frequencies. Increase in size makes it possible to radiate sound with lower frequencies. *Low directivity and slow fading may lessen stereophonic sound impression. Still, listening from an off-center position gives some imaging of phantom sources as the other speaker can be heard with its full spectrum, but with extra delay due to the listeners local position. Business history NXT created intellectual property for surface transducers. HiWave Audio was created in late 2010 as the rebirth of NXT. Tectonic Elements was founded following the acquisition of HiWave Audio by FLAT Audio Technologies.

It was founded in 1910 as Höhere Mädchenschule (girls' school for higher education), and after the passing of the mixed-sex education bill in 1969, it became accessible to boys in 1970. In that same year the school also offered its first bilingual program in German and English, effectively becoming the first bilingual Gymnasium in Hamburg. Lying in the south-west of the Hamburg quarter Harvestehude on the border with Eimsbüttel, the Helene-Lange-Gymnasium currently has around 930 students from 46 nationalities.Die Welt-Schüler by Christoph Scheurmann of wissen.spiegel.de on 20. August 2007 Historical referencesName= The HLG has had a long history of changing its name. The Hamburg senate gave the school the name Staatliche höhere Mädchenschule an der Hansastraße. By 1926, the school was renamed from Lyzeum mit Studienanstalt an der Hansastraße to Mädchen- Oberrealschule an der Hansastraße. The change in name from Lyzeum to Oberrealschule created an opportunity to name the school after Helene Lange, a prominent pedagogue and feminist. It was in 1926 that the school was finally given the name Helene-Lange-Oberrealschule, in small part because only a tenth part of the school's periphery was actually on Hansa street. = Edification = The building which today houses the Helene-Lange-Gymnasium was built between 1908 and 1910 by the architect Albert Erbe, and officially opened on 4 January 1910, at the same time as Gymnsaium Lerchenfeld, which shared similar characteristics and objectives, and whose main building was designed by the same architect. =Nazi era= Some 300 Jewish pupils passed through the school between 1910 and 1933. In 1935, on the occasion of the school's 25th anniversary, the school's name was renamed to Hansa-Oberrealschule. At the ceremony, the headmaster, who had believed the school's inclusive nature (\\"Völkerversöhnung\\") was a detriment to German nationality and to the \\"preferment of the Jewish element\\" within the school, said the school was imbued with a \\"new spirit\\", noting that nearly a fifth of the girls were members of the Nazi BDM. At that point began a decline in the number of Jewish students, and by 1939 there were no more pupils of the Jewish faith. International recognition The Helene-Lange-Gymnasium is one of Germany's first UNESCO project schools.Helene-Lange-Gymnasium from www.schulweb.de Since 2003 the school also offers the International Baccalaureate additionally to the Abitur.

As of November 2012, over 1 billion SOC units had shipped containing cores developed by Imagination Technologies. On 17 December 2012, Imagination Technologies beat Ceva Inc in the race to buy processor technology firm MIPS Technologies with a knockout offer of $100 million. On 8 February 2016, Imagination Technologies announced that Sir Hossein Yassaie had stepped down from the company after 18 years as CEO. Imagination Technologies had seen over 40 percent of its market value lost in the past few months, and over 85 percent since it peaked in 2012, due to its dependence on Apple which had seen slowing iPhone sales. Andrew Heath, a member of Imagination's board of directors and former director of Rolls-Royce, was appointed as interim chief executive before taking the role on a permanent basis on 26 May 2016. Additionally, Imagination announced a restructuring program to cut costs by £15m in the next financial year, and announced its intention to sell its Pure digital radio division. In March 2016, Apple considered buying Imagination Technologies but never made a formal offer. From 2015 to 2017, despite retaining the licensing agreement, Apple engineered a \\"brain drain\\" of Imagination Technologies's personnel, including engineers and executives. Apple also established a new office for chip development in St Albans, close to Imagination Technologies' headquarters. On 3 April 2017, Imagination Technologies' stock prices fell by 70% after it reported that Apple planned to stop using its intellectual property within its system-on-chips within the next two years. Apple accounted at the time for more than half of the company's revenue. The following month, Imagination Technologies announced that it would enter into a dispute resolution process seeking that Apple license its intellectual property, arguing that Apple \\"has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination’s technology, without violating Imagination’s patents, intellectual property, and confidential information\\". The company also announced that it would sell its MIPS and Ensigma businesses. MIPS was sold to Wave Computing in 2017, where \\"MIPS operates as an IP licensing business unit\\". On 15 May 2017, Sondrel announced it had signed an agreement to acquire the IMG Works division. On 22 June 2017, Imagination Technologies' board of directors announced it was putting the entire company up for sale and, on 25 September 2017, they announced that the company was being acquired by Canyon Bridge, a private equity fund ultimately owned by the Chinese government. In November 2017 the sale to Canyon Bridge was approved in a transaction which valued the business at £550 million (£1.82 per share). Once the sale was complete CEO Andrew Heath and CFO Guy Millward both departed. The CEO position was taken over by Leo Li, however Mr Li was replaced in turn by Dr Ron Black. On 2 January 2020, Imagination Technologies announced a new multi-year license agreement with Apple including access to a wider range of Imagination's IP in exchange for license fees. This deal replaced the prior deal signed on 6 February 2014. Since the sale to Canyon Bridge, there have been security concerns over possible technology transfers to Chinese state-owned enterprises, leading to key executives of Imagination being summoned to appear before the Foreign Affairs Select Committee of the British parliament.

History  Early years = Bluewater Michigan Chapter was originally intended to exist in the Port Huron, Michigan area and thus named \\"Bluewater.\\" Shortly after, however, it leased the former SEMTA Commuter Rail maintenance facility in Pontiac, Michigan, adjacent to the large Grand Trunk Western yards. Bluewater focused on railway excursions around and beyond the state of Michigan, usually hauled by the host railroad's locomotives. They also loaned their coach fleet out to other excursion operators. An example of a Bluewater excursion would be from Detroit to Fort Wayne, Indiana on July 28 and 29, 1984, where the Norfolk and Western 611 steam locomotive hauled 24 cars including Bluewater coaches. Many Bluewater members stored and maintained their privately owned coaches at Bluewater's yard locations. This proved to be a symbiotic relationship, as Bluewater was able to use these coaches in their excursions, allowing passenger trains longer than 20 cars. In Owosso, Michigan, Project 1225 had restored the steam locomotive Pere Marquette 1225 and allied with Bluewater to run excursion trains in 1988.Project 1225 Newsletter, Number 75, October 1988. = Saginaw relocation = Bluewater lost the lease to the SEMTA rail facility, and a search for a new location led them to the former Pere Marquette roundhouse/locomotive shops in Saginaw, Michigan which they lease from the Lake State Railway. However, the lease was cancelled in 2009 and the Bluewater shops have moved to another facility in the Saginaw area. This lease was also lost, which resulted in selling all of the rail car fleet (both freight and passenger cars). = Modern day = Bluewater operated occasional trips around Michigan into the late 2000s (decade). They also held a monthly membership meeting in Royal Oak, Michigan. Bluewater NRHS ceased to operate at the end December 2019.

The film, which was directed by Forest Whitaker, is the cinematic debut of Bokeem Woodbine. It features several rappers including Fredro Starr, Sticky Fingaz, Busta Rhymes, Yo-Yo and Kool Moe Dee. Plot Diquan Mitchell (Woodbine), a 19-year old ex-con, attempts to turn his life around and start legitimate work. At the beginning of the film, Mitchell witnesses an argument between two youths Chucky and Pharaoh in the stairwell of his apartment building upon arriving home. Deciding not to expose the youth who did the shooting to law enforcement, Mitchell takes the handgun used in the killing from him and tells him to run. Mitchell, who lives in a Brooklyn public housing project apartment with his two sisters, mother and grandmother has a girlfriend named Latisha Jordan (Goodwin) who is 8 months pregnant. Mitchell's girlfriend who is also an ex-felon (having been arrested two times prior) gets caught selling crack cocaine to an undercover New York cop. After a bond hearing, The judge sets bail at $2500 for Jordan. Due to not having the funds to bail her out, Mitchell join forces with the police in a complicated undercover operation that involves selling guns on the street while selling information to the police. In addition to becoming an informant, Mitchell is also promised a deal by the cops that the lengthy imprisonment (of either 18 months or 8 years) and the case for Jordan would be dismissed if they successfully take down a gun salesman name Ben (Wasson) who has been selling guns to neighborhood youths. Mitchell teams up with his long-time friend Bamboo (Starr) to help out with the case while pocketing cash from gun sales on the side (Bamboo not knowing that Mitchell is involved with the cops). Shortly after bailing his girlfriend out of jail, Mitchell and Bamboo speaks with Ann (Yo-Yo), who puts them in contact with her brother in Georgia to buy guns to make their own profits. The cops later stake-out the location where Ben set-up to make sales, having arrested him earlier for possession of 150 firearms at his suburban-area home. The cops are later informed by the ATF that they can't charge him due to lack of evidence that he is selling the weapons to youths. Due to this, the cops later tell Mitchell that they need more evidence on Ben. After his run-in with the cops, Ben later returns to the neighborhood to locate Bamboo; running into other youths who give him Bamboo's beeper (also known as a pager) number in return for multiple firearms. Ben then reaches Bamboo via phone and lets him know that he is aware that Bamboo has been speaking with the cops about his gun selling business and threatens his life. Thereafter, Mitchell and Bamboo visits a local convenience store where Bamboo accidentally shoots a 5-year-old girl. After being interrogated by the cops for the murder, Mitchell and Bamboo are released from jail. Upon returning to the neighborhood, Mitchell is told by Lay-Lay that everybody has been saying he has been working with the cops. Bamboo later shows up at Mitchell's apartment to confront him about the news which leads to a fight and shootout between the two.

It nominally stars Dirk Bogarde (who only appears in the film's second half) and principally features a cast of seven juvenile actors, including Pamela Franklin, Phoebe Nicholls and Mark Lester, with popular British actress Yootha Joyce in a supporting role. The screenplay was written by Jeremy Brooks and Haya Harareet, based on the 1963 novel of the same name by Julian Gloag.Gloag, Julian.Our Mother's House Plot The seven Hook children, whose ages range from five to fourteen, live in a dilapidated Victorian house in suburban London. The older children help to care for their invalid single mother, whose chronic illness has led to her to convert to fundamentalist religion and refuse all medical help. When their mother dies suddenly, the children realise that they may be split up and sent to orphanages, so they decide to conceal their mother's death and carry on with their daily routine as if she were still alive. They secretly bury their mother in the back yard at night, and convert the garden shed into a shrine to her, where they periodically hold seances to communicate with her spirit. The eldest child, Elsa, takes charge. The children make excuses for their mother's absence to their neighbours and teachers, claiming that the doctor has sent her to the seaside for her health, and they dismiss their abrasive housekeeper, Mrs Quayle. The children realise they can support themselves after Elsa discovers that younger brother Jiminee can convincingly forge their mother's signature, enabling them to cash the trust fund cheques that arrive for her each month, and they also discover that their mother has left over £400 in her savings account. Some of the children suggest contacting their estranged father, but the idea is rejected by Elsa, who has been indoctrinated with her mother's bitter contempt for her shiftless ex-husband. When oldest brother Hubert discovers that Elsa knows their father's contact address (a letter arrives which Elsa tears up in front of Hubert), Hubert suggests that they get in touch with him, hoping he will help them. Elsa dismisses the idea and throws the address away, but when she leaves the room Hubert recovers it. For the next six months, the children carry on an outwardly normal life, although conflict arises when Gerty innocently takes a ride on a stranger's motorbike. Horrified by Gerty's contact with an outsider, Diana 'consults' their mother's spirit. The siblings denounce Gerty as a 'harlot' and they punish her by taking away the precious comb their mother had given her, and cutting off her long hair. Soon after, Gerty falls ill, and although Diana follows their mother's practice and refuses to get a doctor, Gerty eventually recovers. The children's secret world begins to change when Jiminee brings home Louis, a friend from his school, and allows him to hide there. Soon their teacher arrives, demanding to search the house and retrieve the missing boy, but the situation is defused by the unexpected arrival of their father, Charlie. He immediately moves in, and Hubert admits that he had secretly written to Charlie, asking him to come. The family adjusts to the new domestic situation, with Charlie taking them on outings, and even buying a new car. Most of the children (especially Diana) come to trust and love him, although Elsa remains deeply suspicious of him. The children's idyllic world begins to crumble after Charlie has a chance encounter on a bus with Mrs Quayle. She soon reappears at the house, demanding to know what has happened to Mrs Hook, but she is placated by Charlie. She inveigles her way back into the home, and she and Charlie soon begin a relationship. As time passes Charlie reverts to form, spending freely, drinking heavily, and entertaining 'loose women' in the house. Learning of Jiminee's ability to forge their mother's signature, Charlie convinces him to sign documents without his siblings' knowledge, and he further alienates the children when he dismantles their garden shrine. Matters come to a head when an estate agent and a couple let themselves in to inspect the house. Although Diana still refuses to see the truth, Elsa and Gerty correctly deduce that Charlie intends to sell the house, and after searching his room they discover that he has squandered virtually all of their mother's savings. When Charlie arrives home that night, the children demand an explanation. He at first tries to cover for himself but, confronted by the implacable Elsa, he reveals all, and furiously denounces their mother – he explains that she had led a dissolute life before she fell ill and turned to religion, that the children are in fact the illegitimate offspring of her many adulterous liaisons, and that none of them are his own. He further reveals that he now controls the property, having used Jiminee to unwittingly forge their mother's signature and sign over the title deed for himself. When he callously declares that he despises the children, and that he intends to sell the house and put them all into care, Diana snaps and kills him with a poker. The children briefly debate whether or not to bury Charlie in the garden and carry on as before, but they finally accept the gravity of their situation. As the film ends, the children leave the house for the last time and walk off into the dark to turn themselves in to the authorities.

A 1966 letter from Gloag to Clayton suggests that 20th Century Fox was initially interested in producing a film adaptation and that Eleanor Perry had written a script, but it was ultimately acquired for Clayton by MGM and Filmways executive Martin Ransohoff. Clayton commissioned Jeremy Brooks (then literary manager of the Royal Shakespeare Company) to write the script, but he found Brooks' adaptation too long and too close to its source, so he brought in his wife, the noted Israeli-born actress and writer Haya Harareet, who \\"tightened the structure and particularly changed the ending to make it more thematically consistent and psychologically consistent than in the novel\\".Neil Sinyard, Jack Clayton (Manchester University Press) pp. 133 Richard Burton was the first choice to play Charlie, but it was thought that his fee would push the budget too high, so Bogarde was eventually cast in the role instead. The juvenile cast was led by Pamela Franklin, who had previously worked with Clayton (as Flora, one of the possessed siblings) in The Innocents. Yootha Joyce had also worked with Clayton before, in an acclaimed cameo role in Clayton's The Pumpkin Eater (1964). \\"Our Mother's House\\" is the second in a loose 'trilogy' of films in which Clayton explored themes of the occult, and of children in isolated situations who are threatened by evil. He most famously essayed these subjects in The Innocents, his acclaimed adaptation of Henry James' \\"The Turn of the Screw\\", and he returned to it in the 1980s with his screen adaptation of Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes (1983). In his 1975 memoir, Dirk Bogarde recounted his experience with the production in glowing terms: :\\"On my first morning in the gloomy house in Croydon I was in a bit of a funk. Eight pairs of eyes, ranging from five to fourteen, gazed at me solemnly. Not a smile, no welcoming grin even. In the little caravan in the scrubby front garden which I had been given to change in there was a jam jar stuffed with privet and some wilting Michaelmas daisies. Under it was a note. :'Let's hope you're as good as you're cracked up to be. You'd better be. Sincerely, The Children.' :\\"I loved every second of the film, which was one of the happiest I have ever made.\\"Dirk Bogarde, Snakes and Ladders (Chatto & Windus, London, 1975) pp. 247-248 Our Mother's House was also the second of five collaborations between Clayton and noted French composer Georges Delerue, who had previously written the score for Clayton's The Pumpkin Eater (1964). 16 years after making Our Mother's House, Clayton and Delerue reunited for Something Wicked This Way Comes (1983), although that production was troubled, with the studio (Disney) forcing Clayton to replace Delerue's original music (which was considered 'too dark') with a new score by James Horner. Delerue went on to compose the music for Clayton's last two projects, The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne (1987), and the TV movie Memento Mori (1992). Critical reception Reviewing the film on its U.S. release in November 1967, Roger Ebert gave it a 3-1/2 star rating. He described the film as \\"one of the most suspenseful of recent years ... It isn't phony \\"who goes there?\\" suspense but suspense based on real personalities trapped in an impossible situation\\". Ebert also particularly praised the performances of the juvenile cast: :\\"The use of children in movies is a hazardous business, if only because the little monsters walk away with the whole enterprise: plot, atmosphere, everything ... Occasionally, however, a director succeeds in beating the little prodigies into submission and wringing restrained performances from them, and when this happens, the result can be memorable. Peter Brooks did it with his castaways in \\"Lord of the Flies\\"; Lee Thompson did it with Hayley Mills in \\"Tiger Bay\\"; and now Jack Clayton has done it superbly in Our Mother's House ... (he) ... directs with firm restraint. Bogarde turns in a competent performance not quite up to his best, but it really isn't his picture anyway. It belongs to the kids, and they are very real kids.\\"rogerebert.com In the April 2014 edition of the BFI's Sight & Sound, Pasquale Iannone's article entitled \\"Age of Innocence\\" examines the history of children in films, writing: :\\"Having talked about the tension, the push and pull between the worlds of adult and child, what happens when the child is left alone, when there are no rules left to break? In Jack Clayton's \\"Our Mother's House\\" (1967), a family of seven children decide not to report their mother's death from illness for fear of being sent to an orphanage. Instead, they bury their mother in the garden of their large family home and continue life as normal. Clayton charts the full gamut of childhood emotion – carefree and playful one minute, unforgivingly cruel the next – in what remains one of the most sorely underappreciated portraits of the vicissitudes of childhood.\\" Awards * Dirk Bogarde earned one of his six BAFTA Best Actor nominations for his performance in the film, * The film was nominated for the Golden Lion for Best Picture at the 1967 Venice Film Festival.

Cai was born in Shanghai but grew up in Shuangfeng County in Hunan Province of China. He helped Mao organize the Changsha New People's Study Society. In 1919 he went to France on the Work-Study program, and his letters of advocacy were important in convincing Mao of the Bolshevik revolutionary approach. On his return to China, he was an important leader and organizer for the young Communist Party, spent several years in Moscow, and returned to China again in 1931. While organizing revolutionary activity in Hong Kong, he was arrested and given over to Canton authorities, who executed him in August, 1931. Youth and education Cai's family included both merchants and scholar- officials, but his father had not done well in the family business and instead obtained a job in the Jiangnan Arsenal in Shanghai, where Cai was born, March 30, 1895, the fifth of six children. Cai's mother, left her husband, apparently angered at his taking a \\"secondary wife.\\" She returned to Hunan in the spring of 1899, taking Cai and his younger sister, Cai Chang (), and refusing to live with her husband even when he too returned. The family had little money but Cai found his apprenticeship in his father's business to be unbearable. Cai's mother sold her personal possessions to enable Cai to attend a village school at the age of sixteen. He then studied at Hunan First Normal School and at the Hunan First Normal University in Changsha. Cai studied under Yang Changji, and joined student movements with his fellow student Mao Zedong. In June 1917, he graduated. In April 1918, Cai, Mao Zedong, and a dozen others organized the New People's Study Society (Xin Min Xue Hui) in Changsha. It was said that \\"Hesen is the theorist and Mao the realist\\" Yang Changji had urged his students to stay away from holding public office and to serve society by maintaining independence and moral purity. Cai rejected this Neo-Confucian position. He declared that \\"what I advocate is to commit wrongs in order to achieve a greater good.\\" When he heard that the anarchists and educators Cai Yuanpei and Li Shizeng had organized a Work-Study Program to send students to France who would finance their study by working in French factories, he and other members of the Society went to Beijing to seek their help. In France In 1919, he traveled to France for the Work-Study Program with his mother and his sister Cai Chang (). On the ship he met and fell in love with Xiang Jingyu. At a time when \\"free love,\\" that is, individual choice, was considered indecent, the two discussed political problems and theories, leading to a romantic relationship. In Paris, Cai organized the Work and Study Cooperative Society (Gongxue huzhu she) and advocated Marxist communism. In May 1920, Cai and Xiang Jingyu were married. Cai's conviction that only violent revolution could solve China's problems fractured the Work-Study student group, but Cai was determined to form a Marxist party among his Hunan fellow students. Cai's letters to Mao Zedong, who was then in Beijing, were influential in their advocacy of Bolshevism. Mao replied, \\"there is not one word with which I do not agree.\\" Cai Hesen and wife Xiang Jingyu In July 1920, Cai and leaders of the New People's Study Society publicly attacked the leaders of the Work-Study Movement for their optimistic anarchist belief in cultural change, education, and communal values. After the Communist Party of China was founded, Cai wrote and gained permission to establish an official branch in Europe. In the latter half of 1921, Cai was arrested by the French government for organizing a wave of protests against the Work-Study leadership over admissions to the Sino- French Institute at the University of Lyons, and was deported soon after. Revolutionary career Cai and Xiang Jingyu returned to China to work in the Chinese Communist Party's central organization. He founded the first newspaper, The Guide (), of the CCP's central authority. Cai was a member of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th Central Committees of the Communist Party of China, as well as a member of the 5th and 6th Central Political Bureaus and other important positions. In 1925, he served as the CCP's representative to the international Communist movement in Moscow. While in Moscow, his marriage with Xiang broke up (in 1928 she was betrayed to the police of the French concession in Wuhan and executed). In 1927, Cai returned to China, but went to Moscow again in 1928 to cure disease. Death In 1931 Cai returned to Shanghai to support the Guangdong provincial People's Committee. He then went to Hong Kong to direct party work there. He was betrayed by Gu Shunzhang when attending a meeting in Hong Kong. He was arrested in British Hong Kong and extradited to the Chinese authorities in Guangzhou, which was controlled by the warlord Chen Jitang. He was tortured and executed in August 1931, aged 36. The wife of Cai, Xiang Jingyu, was arrested a few years earlier in the Shanghai French Concession in Wuhan on 20 March 1928 due to the betrayal of members of her group to the police. The French officials turned her over to the Guomindang in April 1928. On the first of May of the same year, Xiang Jingyu was executed by Guomindang police. Family Cai Hesen's father was Cai Rongfeng (), and his mother was Ge Jianhao (). His first wife was Xiang Jingyu, second wife was Li Yichun (). His younger sister Cai Chang was the wife of Li Fuchun. Cai had four children: Cai Ni () and Cai Bo () by Xiang Jingyu, and Cai Zhuan () and Cai Lin () by Li Yichun. NotesReferences and further reading  \\"Ts'ai He-sen,\\" in , pp. 851–852.

Organization and purpose The ASCI is an honorary society to which more than 2,800 physician-scientists from all medical specialties belong. Prospective members are proposed by standing members of the society and elected to ASCI on the basis of an outstanding record of scholarly achievement in biomedical research. The ASCI includes physician-scientists who are active clinically, in basic research, or in teaching. Many of its senior members are widely recognized leaders in academic medicine. As of 2015 the membership of ASCI has included 417 members of the National Academy of Medicine, 191 members of the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 40 Lasker Award winners, and 19 Nobel laureates. The ASCI supports the research into basic mechanisms and/or treatment of human diseases, and to the education of future generations of physician-scientists. The ASCI considers the nominations of several hundred physician-scientists from the United States and abroad each year and elects up to 80 new members each year for their significant research accomplishments relatively early in their careers. The ASCI is a member of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB), which includes numerous biomedical research societies. The ASCI publishes the peer-reviewed biomedical research journals Journal of Clinical Investigation and JCI Insight. A collection of the society's papers is held at the National Library of Medicine. History The American Society for Clinical Investigation has its origins in a chance meeting in June 1907 on the Atlantic City boardwalk, in which Samuel James Meltzer, David Linn Edsall, Wilder Tileston, Warfield Theobald Longcope, and probably Joseph Hersey Pratt were present (). The parties to this meeting considered the need for a new society, separate from the Association of American Physicians (AAP), whose membership was at that time limited to 160 individuals. The purpose of the new society would be to give younger men who were not yet members of the AAP, and not eligible for membership in the AAP, the advantages of meeting other young men active in medical research. The new organization was formally constituted on May 11, 1908, at the New Willard Hotel in Washington. A total of 32 physicians agreed to become charter members of ASCI in 1908. The first meeting of the ASCI was held in Atlantic City on May 10, 1909. The organization was also known as the \\"Young Turks\\" in allusion to the rebellious spirit in which it was founded, as a counterweight to the older and more deeply established Association of American Physicians (colloquially known as the \\"Old Turks\\" in subsequent years).

The film was followed by a 1964 sequel, The New Interns, and a 1970–1971 television medical drama series, The Interns, that was based on the films. The Interns was directed by David Swift. Plot A class of interns arrives for their first year in training at a public city hospital, which serves patients from many different ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Close friends and classmates John Paul Otis (Robertson) and Lew Worship (James MacArthur) plan to become surgeons and open their own clinic together. They are less than thrilled about their assignment to obstetrics, feeling that delivering babies is not very difficult. Lew becomes romantically involved with student nurse Gloria (Stefanie Powers), while John becomes infatuated with fashion model Lisa Cardigan (Suzy Parker). Lisa dislikes the idea of dating a relatively impoverished young doctor, and is pregnant out of wedlock by another man. Although John offers to solve her problem by marrying her, she pressures him to illegally obtain pills for her in hopes of ending the pregnancy. He finally does so, and is caught and reported by Lew, ending their friendship and John's medical career. Sid Lackland (Nick Adams) aspires to serve wealthy patients so he can make a lot of money. Then he becomes attached to Loara (Ellen Davalos), a girl from a poor village in Southeast Asia, who is one of his patients. She has a rare medical condition and is scheduled for a serious operation. Loara resists his friendly overtures because she is sure she will die in the hospital. Sid is heartbroken when Loara dies during her surgery. Alec Considine (Callan) wants a residency under eminent psychiatrist Dr. Bonney, and secretly cheats on his wealthy fiancée Mildred (Anne Helm) with Dr. Bonney's longtime nurse Vicky Flynn in hopes of being introduced to the doctor. To keep up his medical duties and spend time with both women, Alec takes Dexedrine to stay awake. Although he does meet Dr. Bonney, who offers him a residency, Mildred discovers his affair and leaves him. Madolyn Bruckner (Haya Harareet) aspires to become a surgeon under abrasive Dr. Domenic Riccio (Savalas). Despite her skills as an intern, Riccio discourages her because he is prejudiced against female doctors, assuming they will abandon their medical careers to get married and have children. Riccio later finds out Madolyn has already been married and has a child, yet is still pursuing her medical career as a single working mother. At the end of the year, Alec, Lew, and several other interns come under suspicion when a terminally ill, immobile patient who has been begging to die is found dead of a barbiturate overdose. None of the involved interns can accept their residencies until the source of the drugs is found, creating a risk that the residency offers will be withdrawn. Alec, strung out on Dexedrine, has a nervous breakdown at the thought of losing his residency with Dr. Bonney. Lew and the other interns visit the patient's wife and find out that she gave him the drugs after being worn down by his constant pleas that if she really loved him, she would help him die. As a result, the interns are no longer under suspicion and can accept their offers. Lew, having developed an interest in obstetrics after delivering a baby, accepts a residency at the same hospital, and convinces Gloria, who had planned to travel and see the world, to marry him, instead. Sid gets an offer from a wealthy hospital, but inspired by Loara, he goes to practice in impoverished Southeast Asia, instead. Riccio hires Madolyn as his resident assistant. John, now engaged to Lisa, visits his former classmates and tells Lew he respects him for his sense of ethics. A new class of interns arrives and Lew shows them the way to their dormitory, just as a doctor did for him the previous year.

It was published in 1960 and became a best seller. Film rights were bought for a reported $75,000 plus 15% of the profits. It was optioned by producer Robert Cohn who set up the project at Columbia. Columbia offered the film to David Swift to direct. \\"it was the first property that had been presented to me and I thought I could make a fairly decent movie of it, a commercial script\\", said Swift. Among the changes Swift made was adding more comedy which \\"leavened the austerity and brutality of the hospital background\\", according to the director. Robert Wagner had signed a three- picture deal with Columbia, and announced he would play the role of Lew. \\"This won't be another Dr. Kildare picture, with the standard romance and the other stereotypes, I can assure you\\", said Wagner. However his role ended up being played by James MacArthur. Sidney Poitier was also announced for the cast but did not appear in the final film. Reception The movie originally ran for three hours but was cut down to two. =Box Office= The film grossed $9,230,769 at the box office, earning $5 million in US theatrical rentals. It was Columbia's biggest grossing film of the year.

Formula One's rules and regulations are set by the sport's governing body, the FIA. The primary reasons behind rule changes have traditionally been to do with safety. As each decade has passed the FIA have made more and more changes in the regulations so that better facilities and equipment are available in the event of an accident at race meetings. These rule changes have also been aimed at eliminating dangerous practices from the sport in an effort to make it safer. Many innovations and technological improvements have been banned over the years as a result of FIA regulation changes. The governing body have taken these actions to slow the cars down to a level where a Grand Prix car can be driven relatively safely. Without this pruning of the sport's technological advancement cars today could be capable of cornering speeds in excess of 300 km/h. An accident whilst negotiating a corner at this speed would almost certainly result in the death of the driver. Since 2000, the FIA has been issuing an increasing number of rule changes to limit the cost of the sport. The cost of running a team in the sport has increased dramatically in recent years and this situation has not proved sustainable. From 2009 onwards, Formula One has committed itself to dramatic reductions in expenditure.  1950s  Five times World Champion Juan-Manuel Fangio driving a Mercedes-Benz W196 in 1986. Although Formula One races had been taking place since 1948, it was not until 1950 that the World Championship was established. Safety was almost a non-issue in the first 10 years of racing and technological progress was extremely slow compared to modern standards. All of the circuits that Formula One raced on in the 1950s had no safety features; the general mentality was that death was an acceptable risk for winning races, and as a result very few regulations were changed during this period. ; 1950–1953 : Engine specs set at 1500 cc maximum size for engines with a compressor (supercharger or turbocharger) or 4500 cc for naturally aspirated engines. No weight limit. Note that in 1952 and 1953, the World Drivers' Championship was run to Formula Two regulations (maximum capacity of 750 cc for engines with a compressor or 2000 cc for naturally aspirated engines), but the Formula One regulations remained unchanged, and numerous non-championship Formula One races were held during this period. Also for 1952, crash-helmets were made compulsory; but these helmets were made with dubious materials and looked like medium-sized dinner bowls. ; 1954 : Engine specs amended to allow 750 cc maximum engine size with a compressor or 2500 cc for a naturally aspirated engine. No weight limit. ; 1958 : The use of commercial petrol became compulsory and alcohol-based racing fuels were banned.  1960s  Cooper T66 which raced during the 1963 and 1964 seasons. Pedro Rodríguez driving the BRM P133 in 1968. The 1960s began the way the previous decade had ended for Formula One's rule book with relatively few changes made. However, with the advent of a new breed of innovative and forward thinking designers like Colin Chapman and the beginnings of drivers lobbying for safer racing conditions, the number of rule changes made began to accelerate as the decade came to a close. ; 1960 : Regulations unchanged from 1959 (maximum engine capacity of 750 cc for a compressed engine or 2500 cc for naturally aspirated engines. No weight restrictions). ; 1961–1965 : Engine specs amended to a naturally aspirated engine of between 1300 cc and 1500 cc, no compressors allowed, minimum weight set at 450 kg, pump fuel only, automatic starter, roll bar required, double braking system mandatory, standardised seatbelt anchorage, fire protection for fuel tanks, fillers and breathers, FIA begin to organise safety inspections (previously done by local authorities), protective helmet and overalls obligatory, flag signalling code established. ; 1966–1969 : Engine specs amended to a 1500 cc engine with a compressor or a 3000 cc naturally aspirated engine allowed, minimum weight set at 500 kg, electrical circuit breaker, reverse gear, oil catch tank, a rollbar 5 cm above driver's head, two-part extinguisher system and cockpit designed for quick evacuation all made mandatory, all aerodynamic features must be immobile (thereby banning air brakes) and fixed to a sprung part of the car, maximum bodywork height and width restrictions ban the use of dangerous high wings, recommendations made on seat harnesses, fire-resistant clothing and shatterproof visors. Straw bales were banned from being used as safety barriers in response to Lorenzo Bandini's fatal accident in Monaco in 1967.  1970s  Peter Gethin driving the 1971 McLaren M19A. The 'ground effect' Lotus 78 pictured in 1977. The speed of Formula One cars had increased dramatically since 1950 but the standard of safety at race meetings had not followed suit. Deaths were still common, and there were many factors at play to blame. Many of the drivers felt that the danger level involved in the sport was unnecessarily high despite the changes in the rules that had been implemented by the end of the 1960s. The drivers' crusade for improved safety was led in the 1970s by Jackie Stewart. After the needless and avoidable death of Ronnie Peterson at the Italian Grand Prix in 1978, the sport finally made the wholesale changes needed to bring it up towards the modern standards of safety which it enjoys today. The 1970s was the last decade that Formula One raced at truly long circuits (i.e. with lap times close to or over 3 minutes); and going into the decade, Formula One still raced at the 5-mile Charade circuit, the 8.7-mile Spa-Francorchamps circuit and the 14.2-mile Nürburgring Nordschleife. Although all of the aforementioned circuits were improved with safety features, by 1977 Charade, Spa and the Nürburgring were all no longer on the calendar all for the same general reason- safety concerns. Safer circuits such as Paul Ricard, Zolder and Hockenheimring were built with safety features installed; and at the end of the decade Formula One had become a safer sport, although it was still dangerous. Ground effect, a technology that was able to create huge amounts of downforce with inverted aerofoils mounted on the sides of the car, was discovered and developed by Colin Chapman and his Lotus team in the mid 70s, and the technology was perfected with the dominant Type 79. All the other teams followed suit, and the performance of the cars skyrocketed over a period of 2 years. ; 1970 : Minimum weight set at 530 kg, safety bladder fuel cell tanks introduced, report published on track standards, recommended straw bales be banned, double guard rails in place, 3-metre grass verges, spectators to be kept a minimum of 3 metres behind guard railings, barrier between pit lane and track as well as track width, surface and gradient recommendations and mandatory FIA inspections of track facilities. ; 1971 : Role responsibilities and mandatory equipment list set out for race supervisors, marshals and signalers, drivers must be evacuated from cockpit in less than five seconds. All race distances must be under 200 miles (320 km). ; 1972 : Minimum weight increased to 550 kg, safety foam in fuel tanks, no magnesium sheeting to be less than 3 mm thick, 15w red rear light mandatory, head rest required, minimum cockpit dimensions, combined electrical cut off and extinguisher external handle required, fuel tanks to meet FIA specifications, six-point harness required, circuit safety criteria set down, driver's code of conduct released. ; 1973 : Numbers now assigned to drivers. The #1 number is assigned to the reigning World Champion. Minimum weight increased to 575 kg, crushable structure around fuel tanks mandatory, no chrome plating of suspension parts allowed (to avoid hydrogen embrittlement),Jim Stengel's McRae GM-1 Formula 5000 Race Car, Number 59 drivers required to carry medical card and submit to medical examination before they are able to race, catch fencing and rescue equipment mandatory at races, starting grid dimensions standardised, fire service regulations established. ; 1974 : Self-sealing fuel lines mandatory, sand traps added to catch fencing as safety features at circuits, 2x2 staggered starting grid with 12 metres allowed per car. ; 1975 : Marshal's posts to be provided with service roads for ease of access, FIA standard set for fire resistant clothing. ; 1976 : Airboxes on the top of cars are banned, and the cooling of engines through similar means is heavily limited. \\"Safety structures\\" around dashboard and pedals implemented. After Niki Lauda's near-fatal accident at a nearly inaccessible point at the treacherous 14.2 mi (22.8 km) Nürburgring in West Germany, the circuit was taken off the 1977 calendar after having been on the calendar for all but 4 seasons of Formula One up to 1976. ; 1977 : Pedal box safety structures more adequately defined, gravel traps defined more adequately, helmets must be made to FIA approved standards. ; 1978 : Brabham's BT46B 'fan car' deemed illegal and banned after its first (and only) appearance of the season where it won at the Swedish Grand Prix, bulkhead behind driver and front roll bar defined, licence qualification criteria set for all drivers, all grid slots allocated 14 metres per car. Following a request from Lotus, a single centrally mounted fuel tank between the driver and engine is permitted. Previously, no more than 80 litres of fuel in a single tank is allowed, meaning most cars required 3 separate fuel tanks, usually 2 bag tanks either side of the driver's cockpit and another fuel tank behind him. However, this requires multiply fuel lines for the various tanks, and it is the shearing of the fuel lines in impacts that causes the fires of Jo Siffert, Roger Williamson and Niki Lauda. Therefore, the central single fuel tank pioneered by Lotus becomes accepted as a safer option to stop fuel lines from side impacts being sheared and igniting. ; 1979 : Medical air required to be piped into drivers helmet in the event of an accident, bigger cockpit opening, two mirrors and better fire extinguisher on board cars required, FIA appointed, professional, permanent race starter mandatory.  1980s  1981 World Champion Nelson Piquet at that season's race at Monaco in his ground-effect Brabham BT49C. Eventual triple World Champion Ayrton Senna at the 1988 Canadian Grand Prix in his McLaren MP4/4, powered by a Honda turbocharged engine. With the raft of safety improvements as a result of Peterson's fatal crash being implemented during the late 70s and early 80s Formula One overall became much safer despite the deaths of Patrick Depailler in 1980 and Gilles Villeneuve & Riccardo Paletti in 1982. The huge amounts of downforce created by ground effect became increasingly dangerous as years went on, and aside from the fatal accidents mentioned above, a number of drivers crashed heavily enough for their careers to be brought to an end, and the technology was banned outright at the start of the 1983 season. These safety changes coupled with the much stronger carbon fibre replacing aluminium as the material of choice for chassis construction meant there was not a single driver fatality at a race meeting for the rest of the decade. However one factor threatening to undo all this progress was the almost exponential power increases being extracted from turbocharged engines. Renault proved in 1980 that turbocharging was the way to go to success, with their very dominant performances in qualifying in almost every race, especially on fast and high- altitude circuits, where the thinner air did not affect the turbocharged engines. With power output doubling in less than 10 years and figures in excess of talked about by engine manufacturers, from 1986 onwards the FIA's primary goal was to rein in the turbo engines before finally banning them altogether at the end of the 1988 season. Brabham team owner Bernie Ecclestone and ex-March team owner Max Mosley set new organizational standards for Formula One, something they had been working on since 1972. All the races are now more organized by Formula One Management instead of circuit organizers doing their own things; such as setting specific times for when races, practice sessions and qualifying sessions are to start, and teams must commit to all of however many races are in a season, in order to assure sponsors that their advertising will be seen by television cameras, which was also an enterprise set up by Ecclestone and Mosley. This effectively transformed the sport into the multibillion-dollar business it is today. ; 1980 : Permanent medical facility required at all tracks, these facilities must be staffed by FIA approved medics, fast response car mandatory at all races, minimum weight for F1 car set at 575 kg. ; 1981 : The new Formula One World Championship is officially established by Formula One Management, an organization headed by Britons Bernie Ecclestone and Max Mosley. Through the teams' and the FIA's signing of the 1st Concorde Agreement concocted by Ecclestone and Mosley, they officially set newly organized standards, such as no more sequences of races being run over a period of seven months, and practice and qualifying sessions and the races being started at official times. The series is now an official business operating by its own operational standards while adhering to regulations set by the FIA; all of the circuit organizers must comply to these standards and regulations. This includes private entries of other makes of car disallowed. Any team entering any official championship Formula One race must enter their own cars and all teams have to commit to the number of races scheduled each season. Although the teams have to make their own cars, they are still allowed to purchase engines and gearboxes from independent manufacturers. Flexible side skirts banned to reduce downforce created by ground effect, mandatory ground clearance of 6 cm required to limit ground effect further, Lotus twin chassis type 88 outlawed, pit lane minimum width set at 10 metres, survival cell extending to the front of the driver's feet introduced to improve driver survivability in the event of an accident, minimum weight of car set at 585 kg. ; 1982 : Rotary engines, diesel engines, gas turbine engines and sarich orbital engines all banned as part of the Concorde Agreement, rigid skirts legalised and ride height restrictions removed as FIA admit that policing a ban is not possible whilst many teams are using hydraulic suspension systems to alter ride heights and circumvent the rules, minimum weight of car set at 580 kg. ; 1983 : Ground effect outlawed completely for the beginning of the 1983 season. all cars return to a flat undertray, four wheel drive banned along with cars with more than four wheels, minimum weight set at 540 kg. ; 1984 : In race refuelling outlawed, fuel tank required to be in centre of car, between driver and engine, maximum fuel capacity allowed on cars set at 220 litres per race to try and reduce the output of turbo engines, drivers required to have FIA super licence before they can compete in F1, concrete retaining walls permitted alongside guard rails. ; 1985 : Rear-wing size limits set in place. All cars now subject to a frontal crash test to be deemed race worthy. ; 1986 : Catch-fencing banned, permanent FIA medical service inspector and medevac helicopter mandatory at race meetings, after needless death of Elio de Angelis in testing. All F1 test sessions to be completed under full race meeting safety conditions, engine capacity 1500 cc with compressor (i.e. naturally aspirated engines prohibited), maximum fuel consumption reduced to 195 litres per race. ; 1987 : Boost pressure capped at 4.0 bars to limit turbo power, minimum weight of cars set at 500 kg. Naturally aspirated engines are permitted again, with a maximum capacity of 3500 cc and no fuel limit. Grid slots allocated 16 metres per car. FIA announce that from 1989 onwards turbos will be banned and to encourage teams to switch, two additional championships are introduced, which are open to non-turbo teams only: the Jim Clark Cup for drivers, and the Colin Chapman Trophy for constructors. These one-off championships are won by Jonathan Palmer and by Tyrrell-Ford respectively. ; 1988 : Boost pressure further reduced to a maximum of 2.5 bars to limit the power output of the turbo engines in their final year (until 2014), maximum fuel consumption of turbo cars reduced to 150 litres per race. In any design the driver's feet must not extend beyond the front wheel axle, static crash test of survival cell and fuel cell mandatory, minimum weight of cars increased to 540 kg. ; 1989 : Turbocharged engines banned completely, naturally aspirated engines of 3500 cc in size and 8 to 12 cylinders the only engines permitted, overhead air intakes allowed again, fuel restrictions removed, all track side guard rails must be a minimum of 1 metre in height and the pit wall must be a minimum of 1 m 35 cm in height, all drivers subject to anti doping testing as per IOC guidelines.  1990s  The 1992 Williams FW14B was one of the most technologically advanced Formula One cars of all time. Rubens Barrichello driving for the short lived but successful Stewart Grand Prix team. Despite several near misses (particularly during the turbo era) Formula One had managed to go almost 12 whole years without a single fatality at a race meeting. The strength of the carbon fibre chassis being used and the fortunate escapes of many drivers involved in high speed accidents during this period made many people inside the sport believe that death was a thing of the past in Formula One. This attitude was made to look foolish when the FIA hastily banned virtually all of the performance enhancing electronic technology that the teams had become dependent on for the start of the 1994 season. This made many of that year's cars nervy and edgy to drive. With more horsepower than 1993 but with less in car stability some observers at the time (most notably Ayrton Senna) stated that they believed 1994 would \\"be a season with lots of accidents\\". Near-fatal accidents of JJ Lehto and Jean Alesi during pre-season and in season testing were both to prove Senna right. This was climaxed by the catastrophic 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, with Brazilian Rubens Barrichello being severely injured during a heavy crash in a Friday practice session. This set the stage for the disastrous events of the rest of the weekend, which led to the deaths of Austrian driver Roland Ratzenberger and Senna himself; all three accidents on consecutive days. The sweeping changes that the FIA implemented post-Imola proved to be almost as rash as the ones at the end of 1993 and nearly claimed the life of Pedro Lamy in a testing accident. The cause of the accident was put down as rear wing failure as a result of the FIA rushing through new rules including one reducing the size of the rear diffuser which reduced the number of anchoring points the attached rear wing assembly could use. To its credit the FIA learned from the mistakes of 1994 and much more consideration and forward thinking was put into changes made to the rules from there onwards. By the close of the decade a measure of the impact on the sport that the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix has had was that for the first time in its history, safety had become Formula One's number one concern. ; 1990 : Large mirrors and quick release steering wheel made mandatory, all marshals and medical staff must practice driver extrication exercises. ; 1991 : Front wing narrowed from to . Rear overhang reduced from to . More stringent testing of survival cell by FIA including seat belts, fuel tanks and rollbar. Points scoring system overhauled, win now secures 10 points and all results to count instead of best 11 scores. ; 1992 : Yet more exhaustive testing of survival cell including rear impact testing, height of kerbing lowered, minimum width of pit lane increased to , pit lane entry chicane mandatory, safety car introduced. ; 1993 : Rear tyre width reduced from 18 inches to 15 inches to reduce the grip and so the speed of the cars, overall car width reduced to 200 cm from 220 cm. Rear wing height reduced from 100 cm to 90 cm, distance of front end plates from flat bottom increased from , head rest area increased from .

Lewis Hamilton won the 2008 title in only his second season. He is pictured here driving the McLaren MP4/23 at that year's season opener in Australia. By the end of the 1990s safety standards had risen dramatically for the second time in 20 years. The deaths of marshals in both 2000 and 2001 after being struck by tyres after accidents at the Italian and Australian Grand Prix respectively showed that the sport will never be completely safe. However, on the whole the sport was in much better shape safety wise than it had been before. Save for the introduction of HANS (Head And Neck Support) system in 2003 there have been no major safety improvements in the sport since the turn of the millennium. Most of the changes that the FIA have implemented to the regulations in the nine seasons since the year 2000 have been aimed at trimming speed off the cars and, later in the decade, at reducing the costs involved in Formula One. These have risen by a factor of between three and four for the top teams like Ferrari and McLaren. This sudden increase in budgets has largely been down to the influx of big spending car manufacturers setting up teams in the sport since Mercedes paved the way by buying 40% of the Mclaren team. By 2008, with the global credit crunch turning into a full blown global recession, many of the car manufacturers (whose sales have been hit hard by the economic crisis) can no longer afford the huge amounts of money they are investing in the sport. The gravity of the situation was realised when Honda suddenly withdrew its participation at the end of the 2008 season, later confirming to have sold the team, specifically blaming the world economic crisis. With Toyota and BMW also withdrawing from the sport at the end of the following year, the remaining manufacturers along with the FIA agreed changes to the rules over the next seasons to bring about dramatic cost savings in an effort to save the sport from collapsing under the weight of its own costs. ; 2000 : Engines mandated to be V10 displacing no more than 3000cc, red flag procedure changed where races stopped after two laps but before three-quarters race distance had been completed would be restarted with the cars lining up on the grid in the order they were at the end of the penultimate lap before the lap during which the red flag was shown (only the race order and number of laps completed were taken into account for the new race, time differences between the cars were voided; the distance of the new race was the number of laps remaining from the original races, minus three laps); use of cooled fuel banned mid-season. ; 2001 : Traction control allowed again as FIA admit they are unable to police whether teams are using the system effectively, use of beryllium alloys in chassis or engine construction banned. Fully automatic transmission and launch control were allowed again from the 2001 Spanish Grand Prix. Larger cockpit entry template and survival cell. Rear wings must have no more than 3 elements. ; 2002 : Team orders banned mid-season after Rubens Barrichello hands victory to Michael Schumacher at final corner of the Austrian Grand Prix. ; 2003 : Bi directional telemetry banned HANS (Head And Neck Support) system mandatory, change to point scoring system, points now being awarded down to 8th place, actual points scored now to run 10,8,6,5,4,3,2,1 from 1st to 8th place, testing allowed on a Friday of a race meeting in exchange for a reduction of testing mileage allowed outside of the Grand Prix calendar to make it more affordable for smaller teams, changes to qualifying session with only one flying lap now allowed for grid position with the 107% rule no longer applied, cars may not be refueled between final qualifying and the race start. ; 2004 : Engines required to last a whole race meeting, any engine change to result in 10 place grid penalty, minimum weight set at 605 kg during qualifying and at no less than 600 kg at all other times (including driver and fuel), pit lane speed limited to 100 km/h at all times, each driver must select his wet and dry weather tyre compounds before the start of the race, minimum size of engine cover and rear wing end plates increased to maximise advertising space, multi element rear wings banned and two element wings mandated, launch control banned for the second time, fully automatic transmission banned. ; 2005 : Rear diffuser size reduced to limit downforce, all engines now required to last two race weekends, qualifying format changed to two aggregate times from Saturday afternoon and Sunday morning to count towards grid positions (this format lasted until the European GP when qualifying reverted to a driver's fastest single lap to count from Saturday afternoon qualifying), further changes to dimensions of front and rear wings and nose of car to make overtaking easier, restriction on tyre changes during qualifying and the race itself, if a driver stalls on the grid after the parade lap the other cars will now complete a second lap whilst the stalled vehicle is removed, in the event of a red flag the two-hour race clock will no longer freeze between race sessions. ; 2006 : Only 14 sets of tyres allowed all weekend (seven dry, four wets and three extreme wets), in race tyre changing permitted again, qualifying format changed to three 15-minute shoot outs where the slowest cars are eliminated in the first two sessions leaving the 10 quickest to start with a clean slate and to go for pole position, the final session was reduced from 20 to 15 minutes from the French Grand Prix onwards, Saturday free practice increased from 45 minutes to an hour in length. Engine capacity limited to 2400 cc and number of cylinders allowed reduced to eight in an attempt to reduce horsepower (although teams were allowed to run a rev restricted V10 for an interim period if no engine under the new regulations was available to them), restriction in the use of non-ferrous materials in engine construction along with limiting the number of valves per cylinder to four, all engines must be of a 'V' configuration and at an angle of 90 degrees, ; 2007 : Tuned mass damper system banned, rev limit of 19,000 rpm introduced, rear wing structure strengthened to prevent flexing, increased strength required from rear crash structure, single tyre supplier (Bridgestone) after withdrawal of Michelin, revised tyre regulations mean drivers must use both hard and soft compound tyre during the course of race (soft compound tyres are identified by a white stripe in one of the front tyre grooves), engine development frozen until the end of 2008 to cut costs, further restrictions to regulations means no teams may run a 3rd car on Friday, both sessions on Friday extended to 90 minutes in length, engine changes on first day of practice no longer subject to grid place penalty, pit lane restrictions during any period the safety car is on the track, annual testing limited to 30,000 km to reduce costs. ; 2008 : Traction control banned for the second and final time by means of all teams using a standard electronic control unit (ECU) to eliminate the possibility of teams concealing the technology within their own engine management systems, strict limits placed on the amount of CFD and wind tunnel testing allowed each year. ; 2009 : Banning of almost all aerodynamic devices other than front and rear wing, slick tyres allowed once more (keeping to narrow track dimensions), limit of eight race/qualifying engines for the whole season (every new engine above this eight results in 10-place grid penalty), reduction of rear wing width from 1000 mm to 750 mm and an increase in height from 800 mm to 950 mm, reduction in the ground clearance of front wing from 150 mm to 50 mm and an increase in width from 1400 mm to 1800 mm, rear diffuser to be longer and higher, variable front aerodynamic devices permitted (with limited in car control by driver) and the introduction of KERS (kinetic energy recovery system) to store some of the energy generated under braking and convert it into a temporary horsepower increase of around 80 bhp that can be used 6.6 seconds per lap by the drivers for overtaking.Autosport November 2006 Issue Pit lane is no longer closed when safety car is deployed.  2010s  Previous regulation changes at the tail end of the first decade of the new millennium aimed at improving the show had largely proven to be a failure. With cost escalation now largely under control thanks to recently implemented budget caps and safety standards at an all-time high, the sport's focus for the new decade is around continuing to improve the race spectacle. Alongside this however is the medium term objective of making the sport more environmentally aware, both in an effort to secure its future in times of dwindling fossil fuel reserves, but also to bring in new sponsors put off by the sport's image of conspicuous consumption. ; 2010 : Drastic cost-cutting measures are introduced. In-race refueling ban returns, as a result fuel can be added to any F1 car after qualifying, but Q3 drivers must start the race with the tyres they set their fastest Q2 time with. The same 8 engine limit is maintained despite the increase to 19 races over the course of the season (with a rev limiter set at 18,000 rpm to assist in this), front tyre width reduced from to , a ban on testing during the season as well as an agreement with teams about reducing the number of staff employed. 3 new teams mean 7 drivers are now dropped from Q1 and Q2. Scoring system changed to allow the first ten cars to receive points: 25, 18, 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1. Backmarkers no longer able to unlap themselves behind the Safety Car. Teams unanimously agree not to use KERS for the 2010 season in order to allow all teams time to be able to develop and perfect their own systems. ; 2011 : The double-diffuser concept is banned, with teams requiring the use of simple, single-piece diffusers. The \\"F-duct\\" system pioneered by McLaren is banned (in conjunction with banning shark fins from being connected to the rear wing). Adjustable front wings have also been banned. Gearboxes must last for 5 race weekends, but for the season each driver has one penalty free (a.k.a. a \\"joker\\") gearbox change at their disposal. Driver adjustable rear wing, known as DRS (drag reduction system) introduced to help overtaking. Can be freely used in practice and qualifying, but in the race only when within 1 second of the next car by the detection zone, and only activated in the activation zone. DRS wing must immediately close under braking, and DRS is de-activated in the first 2 laps of each race, plus when a track is declared wet. 107% qualifying rule re-introduced following concerns about new teams pace. Teams agree to re-introduce KERS, with minimum car weight increasing by twenty kilograms to offset the weight of the KERS device. Sporting regulations amended to clear up last-lap safety car and qualifying in-lap procedures. Drivers are also warned to be examples of road safety when driving in public following Lewis Hamilton being pulled over following the 2010 Australian Grand Prix; FIA President Jean Todt suggests a policy similar to the NFL Personal Conduct code for suspension or revocation of racing licences. Ban on team orders lifted (although FIA can use disrepute clause for misuse of it). ; 2012 : Exhaust tailpipes raised after dispute regarding off-blown diffusers at the 2011 British Grand Prix, car noses reprofiled. Reactive ride systems, \\"exotic\\" engine maps, and use of heliums on air guns (to change tyres) banned. Cars must be cleared from all crash tests before pre-season testing. Races capped to four hours (including red flags) following the long red flag during the 2011 Canadian Grand Prix. In-season testing allowed again at the circuit the FIA or teams (upon agreement) choose (Mugello Circuit in case of 2012). Backmarkers able to unlap themselves behind the Safety Car. ;2013 : Further cost-cutting measures introduced, DRS restricted to the designated zones during free practice and qualifying, mid- season testing discontinued once more, \\"modesty panels\\" introduced to compensate for the previous year's front nose reprofilling, double-DRS (pioneered by Mercedes) banned, minimum weight increased to . ;2014 : New car formula of turbocharged V6 engines with 1600cc capacity and 8-speed gearbox introduced, which must now last at least before being replaced and have the KERS (now known as ERS-K) integrated into it. New penalty points system introduced, teams must nominate eight gear ratios ahead of the first race, rear beam wings and false camera mountings banned, in-season testing returns, car nose further reprofiled. A new car number system where the driver is able to choose their own numbers for the duration of their career is also adopted. Double points awarded for the final race of the season. ;2015 : Further nose redesign, drivers restricted further to four engines per year, mid-season significant driver helmet design changes banned, double points no longer awarded for the final race, cars proceed to the pit lane instead of staying on the grid in event of a red flag. ;2016 : Drivers allowed to use five engines per year as number of races is 21. Drivers qualifying for FIA Super Licence must be at least eighteen years old and have scored 40 super licence points in recognised feeder series. ;2017 : Car width increased from 1.8 to 2 metres (reversing 1998 change). Teams restricted to four engines per year irrespective of number of races, engine token system abandoned, car minimum weight increased to , front wings made wider at as well as tyres, power unit suppliers now obliged to supply any team without any power unit contract. Shark fins are brought back and T-wings introduced through loophole. Barge board sizes also increased. The \\"halo\\" cockpit protection device—seen here on a Ferrari SF16-H during testing in 2016—was introduced in 2018. ;2018 : Drivers have been restricted to only three engines per year, despite the fact that the number of races is back up to 21. The shark fins and T-Wings have been banned again. After much debate and testing, the Halo cockpit protection device has been mandatory from the 2018 season onwards. ;2019 : The front wing was simplified, wider, higher, and moved further forward. The rear wing was made wider and higher, with a larger DRS opening to improve DRS, reduce dirty air and promote more overtaking. Winglets were removed from brake ducts. Maximum fuel capacity was increased from to to minimise the need for drivers to conserve fuel during a race. Car's weight no longer includes driver's weight. Bonus point awarded to driver and constructor who sets race fastest lap for the first time since 1959, but the driver must finish in a points scoring position to receive the bonus point. 2020s ;2020 : Teams allowed one additional MGU-K replacement. Free practice sessions now count towards Super Licence points, requiring at least without infractions to receive one, with a limit of ten Super Licence points across a three-season period from free practice sessions. The last of the front wings must not contain any metals as a puncture prevention measure; from 2020 Italian Grand Prix drivers must use the same engine mode in both qualifying and race, thereby banning engine \\"party modes\\". ;2021 : A budget cap of $145 million will be introduced. The double-axis steering (DAS) system pioneered by Mercedes will be banned. Teams agree to use 2020 cars in 2021 with development being done on token basis as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting car development.

When a biblical reference needs to be applied, the quoted passage is from the Gospel of Mark (), where Jesus appears to the eleven remaining apostles after his resurrection and finds them reclining at the table and eating, and he scolds them for not believing those who had witnessed him having returned from the dead. Mensa Christi on the website of the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land. Accessed 30 August 2018 =Significance= The three decades Jesus spent in Nazareth are commonly called \\"the silent years\\", with the Gospels telling us close to nothing about that long period in his life. Over the centuries, Christians have sought for sites suitable for commemorating events from Jesus' life in his home village.Go Israel History In 1781 the Custody of the Holy Land bought the ruined church from the Muslims. The Franciscans initially built a chapel at this site in the latter half of the 18th century. The current church, a renovation of the earlier chapel, was completed in 1861. The Israeli government, in a joint project with the local municipality, recently completed an $80 million renovation and restoration of the old city of Nazareth as part of the Millennium celebrations of the year 2000. A part of this project was the restoration of the church's frescoes and dome. Location Inside the church The church is located within a dense neighborhood, above the church district, in the Old City of Nazareth. It is north of the Sisters of Saint Charles Borromeo Convent, and near the Maronite Church of the Annunciation and Ecumenical Christian Child Care Center. It can be accessed only by foot down a steep road from the Carmelite convent, or above the Synagogue Church. This type of walkway is typical of small alleys in Nazareth and other Arab villages in Israel. The church is locked most of the time, but can be visited upon request. Another \\"Mensa Christi\\" A very similar significance is attached to the Church of the Primacy of St. Peter in Tabgha, on the northwest shore of the Sea of Galilee, where the altar is built upon a cliff known in Latin as Mensa Christi, the Table of Christ, where the resurrected Jesus prepared bread and fishes over a fire for his disciples. This church also commemorates Jesus' reinstatement of Peter as chief apostle.

It is bordered by Thatto Heath, Sutton, Eccleston and the Town Centre. The area is thought to take its name from a farm once located nearby (Ravenhead Farm), while the 'head' portion of the name represents its location at one of the higher points of the town. In this respect, Ravenhead joins other local placenames such as Burtonhead, Micklehead and Eltonhead.  Local facilities  Shops in the main residential area of Ravenhead are limited to a newsagent (Ravenhead), computer repair store (Thatto Heath) and a Spar local store (Toll-Bar). There is also a laundry (business not for individual use) and a 'Fives Football Centre' (closed down), opened by BBC television pundit and former England footballer Alan Shearer. St. John's Centre operates out of St. John's Parish Church (or Ravenhead Church as locals call it) and runs various community activities. Alexandra Court is a residential housing care home, run by Arena Options Ltd for the over 65s.  Ravenhead Retail Park  The Ravenhead Retail Park, to the north of Ravenhead near the Town Centre, is an out of town shopping area featuring a number of high-street outlets. Amongst these are B&Q; and CurrysPCWorld, both of which at the time of building were the largest of the chain's stores in the country. Since the initial build, the retail park has been extended and now includes stores such as Bath Store, Pets At Home and Boots Pharmacy. It is rated amongst the top 20 retail parks in the country. The presence of the retail park means Ravenhead boasts popular food outlets such as Burger King, Frankie and Bennys, Subway and a nearby McDonald's.  Religion & the ecclesiastical parish  The Ecclesiastical Parish of Ravenhead is a Church of England parish, formed on 19 August 1870 by Order of Council. Though there have been some subsequent boundary changes to the parish, it still encompasses some of the neighbouring areas of Thatto Heath, Sutton Heath and Nutgrove. Ravenhead is served by the Church of England parish church of St. John the Evangelist. St. Johns has a smaller, sister church, Emmanuel in neighbouring Thatto Heath. The church is also the home to St. John's Centre - a community outreach project which hosts youth activities, community lunches and various other organised events. The church is part of the Eccleston Team, which partners St. John's & Emmanuel with St. Matthew, Thatto Heath; St. Luke, Eccleston; St. James, Eccleston and Christ Church, Eccleston. This means the benefice that the churches fall within are significantly wider than the parish boundary. There is an Independent Methodist Church in West Street.  Industry  Ravenhead played a significant part in the development of St Helens' glass industry, as the base for Pilkington's Head Office. and the Ravenhead Glass factory. Ravenhead Glass has since closed down, indicative of the decline in the glass industry in the town. Pilkington's Head Office remains, but the company is now owned by Asahi Glass, and areas of the building are used by various other companies. Pilkington's Head Office was formerly the home of Pilkington's Glass Museum, however it has now closed and been incorporated into The World Of Glass museum in the Town Centre. Formerly Ravenhead was home to Ravenhead Coal Mine. It along with numerous small pits were served by private rail lines running off from the main branch line of the Liverpool line, feeding down to the canal and direct to the city centre.

His parents were of mixed Spanish origin, and were reportedly \\"of roving habits\\". His father was a vaquero (cowboy), and Procopio was taught the same business at an early age. His mother was the older sister of the most notorious bandit in California history, Joaquin Murrieta. According to some accounts, Procopio's father was killed by Indians in 1852, and Joaquin Murrieta brought Procopio and his mother to California. Another account indicates that Procopio moved with both parents to Los Angeles County in early 1853. Joaquin Murrieta died in approximately 1853, when Procopio was approximately 12 years old. Joaquin was killed by a group of rangers who placed his head in a brandy jar and displayed it at locations around California for spectators to view for a $1 fee. Joaquin Murrieta became a legendary figure, and in 1854 a fictionalized book was published on his life. The book claimed that Murrieta had been driven to a life of crime after his wife was raped and killed by Yanquis, his brother was hanged, and he was horsewhipped for a crime he did not commit. This account inspired corridos depicting Murrieta as a fierce avenger of injustices against Mexicans. It was said that the young Procopio witnessed his uncle's death and became so obsessed with his uncle that he took to using his name. As a youth, Procopio reportedly gained a reputation as \\"a fearless rider and a reckless youth.\\" Early years: the Raines and Golding murders Procopio's first reported involvement in banditry came on November 17, 1862 when he was suspected in the murder of a Southern California rancher John Raines (or Rains), on the Rancho Cucamonga. Though the San Francisco Chronicle later reported that Procopio murdered Raines, and he was initially detained in the case, Procopio was released due to the lack of evidence against him. John Boessenecker, writes that Procopio fled north and that another confederate Manuel Cerada was caught and fingered Procopio as one of the killers. Cerrada claimed he, Procopio and four others were paid $500 by Ramon Carrillo, another ranchero, to kill Rains. Cerrada was soon lynched and Ramon Carrillo, examined in court was released, no evidence having been found against him.John Boessenecker, Lawman: the life and times of Harry Morse, 1835-1912, University of Oklahoma Press, Norman, 1998 p.32 Shortly after the Raines incident, Procopio appeared in Alameda County. Procopio joined, and soon assumed control of, a gang of bandits headquartered in the Livermore Valley. In 1863, the gang was reportedly engaged in nocturnal raids on farms and ranches in the area.Boessenecker, Lawman: pp. 32 Procopio's gang was suspected in the brutal murder of rancher Aaron Golding (or Golden), his wife, and two children, at Corral Hollow on January 29, 1863.Boessenecker, Lawman: pp.33 The house was burned to the ground, and a vaquero employed by the family was found dead, hanging from a tree on the premises. The Golding murders drew widespread attention, and suspicion immediately turned to Procopio, Narcisso Bojorques, Chano Ortega, and another bandit known to be operating in the area. A Mexican cattle-herder claimed to have witnessed the murders and identified Procopio as the guilty party. Authorities did not believe that the man was not involved, and the only eyewitness was hanged for the crime. Procopio and two other members of his gang were arrested in the Golding murders but were freed due to a lack of evidence against them (the only eyewitness having already been hanged for the crime). Other accounts have attributed the Golding murders to a gang led by Narciso Bojorques and stated that Procopio was a member of the Bojorques gang at the time. Capture and imprisonment in 1863 Procopio was arrested in 1863 for stealing a lot of cattle from a farmer named Pope at a ranch on the Arroyo Vaya. Constable O.B. Wood from San Leandro tracked Procopio to Alvarado, where Procopio sold Pope's cattle to a local butcher, August Maye. Constable Wood drew his gun on Procopio as he was in the act of receiving money from the butcher, but holstered his weapon when Procopio claimed to be unarmed. Procopio drew a pistol and shot Wood in the arm. A crowd of armed citizens pursued Procopio, cornering him at a bridge outside of the town. Procopio took his pistol between his teeth, dove into the river and swam 50 or 60 feet to the other side. The crowd chased him into a salt marsh where a gunfight ensued. Procopio surrendered after his ammunition was used, and he was tried and convicted in San Leandro of stealing Pope's cattle. At his trial, Procopio accepted the entire blame for the theft, thereby exonerating his accomplice Narciso Bojorques. He was convicted and sentenced to nine years in the state prison at San Quentin. Further crimes: 1871–1872 Procopio reportedly teamed up with the notorious Tiburcio Vasquez in an 1871 crime spree. Procopio was released from San Quentin in March 1871, and according to an August 1871 account in the Alameda Gazette \\"returned to his old practices as a dog to vomit.\\" He returned to the Livermore Valley after his release from San Quentin, where he was suspected in May 1871 of stealing two cows belonging to John Arnett. Procopio was believed to be staying with Juan Camargo, a \\"fence\\" or receiver of stolen goods residing in Livermore. One of the head of cattle stolen from Arnett was found in Camargo's yard, and Camargo was arrested and taken to Pleasanton. An armed and masked mob of 50 men seized Camargo from the jail, took him into the woods three miles from Pleasanton, placed a rope around his neck, and lifted him by it until he confessed, charging the robbery upon Procopio and another man. After hearing of the Camargo affair, Procopio reportedly moved south to Monterey County. There, Procopio met and teamed up with the notorious Tiburcio Vasquez. Procopio and Vasquez robbed a Visalia stagecoach near Soap Lake in July 1871. The passengers aboard the coach, four men and a woman, were tied up and robbed of two gold watches and $500 in gold coin. The pair also robbed a Mr. Moore, a delegate to the Santa Clara Democratic Convention, who was riding in a buggy, of $50 in gold coin. They also robbed the Salinas stagecoach station near Salinas Plains. A press report in 1871 noted that Procopio and his gang were \\"splendidly mounted and equipped, wear good clothes and sporting gold watches.\\" During 1871, Procopio was reported to have \\"made himself generally obnoxious\\" to residents in Monterey County. Following a series of stagecoach robberies together, Procopio and Vasquez reportedly fled south for a \\"debauched stay\\" in rural Mexico \\"to spend their new wealth.\\" In early 1872, Vasquez and Procopio are reported to have then taken a steamer to San Francisco. Arrest in San Francisco By early 1872, Tiburcio Vasquez reportedly took to the hills, but Procopio remained in San Francisco, as he \\"had a girl in the city.\\" Other accounts report that Procopio was enjoying \\"the pleasure of fast women in the brothels of (San Francisco's) Morton Street.\\" Procopio was seen in the city, and Sheriff Harry N. Morse of Alameda County began to track him there. A tip led them to a house (described elsewhere as a brothel or dance hall) on St. Mark's place where Morse and three others kept watch. On February 10, 1872, Morse entered through the back door and the other three deputies entered through the front door. As the officers entered, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that \\"the desperado sprang from his seat and was about to draw his revolver, when Morse rushed up behind, seized him by the throat, with one hand, while he leveled a revolver at his head with the other, and casually remarked: 'Put up your hands, Procopio—you're my man.'\\" Procopio was taken by the Oakland boat to the San Leandro jail. At the time of his arrest, the San Francisco Chronicle ran a lengthy article about Procopio's arrest and career, beginning as follows: > Tomaso Rodendo, alias Procopio, although a young man, is one of the most > fearless and daring desperadoes that has ever figured in the criminal annals > of our state. The case drew attention even on the East Coast where The New York Times reported: > Tomas Rodundo, alias Procopio, who is charged with many murders, and stage > robberies, and other crimes, was captured today at his hiding place in San > Francisco. He has been the terror of Southern California for years. He was > surprised today, and had not time to draw his pistols, or, it is said, he > would never have been taken alive. Procopio was initially arrested for complicity in the murder of a Frenchman at Pleasanton, a crime for which his colleague, Bartolo Sepulveda, was given a life sentence. However, Sheriff Morse could not find sufficient evidence of Procopio's role in the murder, and Procopio was instead indicted, tried and convicted of cattle theft and sentenced to another seven years in San Quentin. Later years: 1877–1878 Tejon Pass in 1868 Procopio was paroled in June 1877 and returned to banditry, leading a gang in raids near Fresno, Grangeville and Caliente. In Caliente, Procopio and his gang reportedly made a \\"forced levy\\" on the town's stores and people in the style of Tiburcio Vasquez. Procopio and his gang were captured near the Tejon Pass, and five members of his gang were lynched in Bakersfield. However, Procopio escaped, formed a new gang and was alleged to have robbed a store in Hanford, California of $300 in jewelry. He also robbed the Brownstone & Swartz store at Grangeville in 1878. He put his knife to the stomach of the store manager, Henry Jerusalem, and reportedly said, \\"You, do not know me—no? I am Procopio—the Red-Handed Dick. You will open the safe for me, amigo.\\" Procopio tied up Jerusalem and another worker, Emil Seligman, leaving them to lie on the store's floor overnight with their small dog for company. Loaded with clothing and supplies, Procopio fled on horseback for Arroyo Poso de Chane, several miles east of the present Coalinga. Procopio's horse drowned as he attempted to cross a slough near Summit Lake. Traveling by foot, he encountered the posse sent to capture him at the sheep camp of Frank Woods and Theodore Draper. According to a first-person account by posse member Joel Whiteside, posse members encountered Procopio carrying a saddle on a trail, and Procopio asked in Spanish if they knew the way to Libertad, a nearby Mexican settlement. One of the posse members attempted to question him, but Procopio reportedly fled into the fog. The next day, the posse received a tip that Procopio was staying at a cabin owned by the Higuera brothers. According to Whiteside, they found Procopio asleep in the cabin and took him into custody. Procopio asked permission to dress himself and, when he put on his coat, drew two pistols from his breast pocket and opened fire. In the ensuing firefight, posse member Sol Gladden, who was to have been married the following week, was shot twice (once in the mouth) and killed as he entered the cabin. According to one press report: \\"Procopio made good his escape after the possemen had emptied their weapons vainly trying to shoot him in the smoke-filled cabin.\\" Following the death of Sol Gladden, the pursuit of Procopio intensified. The San Jose Mercury reported on the chase as follows: > Procopio is regarded as even a more dangerous man than (his intimate > associate and dead confederate Tiburcio) Vasquez. He possesses a greater > physical strength, is more blood-thirsty and revengeful, and is fully as > cunning. After his release from San Quentin he went to Livermore and one > night in affray at the Mexican settlement, known as Mexico, he shot a man, > but for some reason was not prosecuted. Then he came to Mayfield, and a few > days afterward shot a Californian in the leg in a difficulty about a woman. Press accounts of the time indicate that Procopio was aided in his escape as the posse was \\"several times misled and deceived by Mexicans along the route.\\" Deputy Sheriff W.J. Ellis reported overtaking Procopio on his escape. Procopio asked Ellis in Spanish why Ellis was following him, and Ellis responded by telling Procopio to put up his hands. A gunfight ensued in which Procopio shot one of Ellis' fingers. Procopio escaped through a thicket, though a Mexican national told Ellis the following day that Procopio had been slightly wounded by a shotgun blast. Uncertainty regarding death There are numerous and contradictory accounts of Procopio's exploits after his escape in 1878. Some indicate he was still working as an active bandit as late as 1882. There were press accounts of his having been arrested near Tucson, Arizona in 1883. One historical account reports that, in 1882, Procopio shot and killed an actor in a Mexican brothel, was arrested and executed by a firing squad.John Boessenecker, \\"Lawman\\", p. 181 Another account states that he returned to Mexico and served in the army there. Yet another says that, after fleeing California in 1878, Procopio wandered among Mexican settlements, \\"making himself heartily disliked for his quarrelsomeness and his boastfulness of what he had done as a bad man to the hated gringo.\\" According to that rendition, when he boasted of his exploits in one rural cantina, a group of rurales was dispatched from the barracks, and a dozen of them opened fire on Procopio at close range, later reporting that \\"Redhanded Dick fell across the threshold riddled like the traditional sieve.\\" Others say he died in Sonora, Mexico in 1882. Some accounts even indicate that he died in the early 1890s.  Folklore of Procopio  As years passed, the stories of Procopio's exploits grew. In 1925, the Los Angeles Times published a lengthy profile titled: \\"Killing Was Pastime for 'Red-Handed Dick,' One of California's Most Fearsome Bandits.\\" The 1925 profile described Procopio as one of the most blood-thirsty of California's 19th century bandits: > Procopio got his title of Red-handed from his absolute wantonness and > cruelty. He is said to have been the nearest rival of Three-fingered Jack > ... in the joy of killing. His partners, of course, had few compunctions. > But they killed in the way of business or to facilitate their escape. The > situation never was so desperate and pursuit never so near but what Procopio > had time to slash or stab with his knife, or to drop some inoffensive person > with his pistol. One of his favorite pastimes was to ride gravely and > innocently past when he met a stranger on the trail, and then to bury his > huge knife to the hilt between the unsuspecting victim's shoulders. He > seemed to love the feel and the color of warm blood, and so he used the > knife whenever possible. Though the accounts of the day portray Procopio as a killer, the language of the 1925 profile reflects the apparent embellishment of the legend. It has been reported that, as Procopio's legend grew, men would turn pale at the mention of his name, and mothers would frighten their children with it.

The pulp narrative was played for laughs, and designed as an indictment of war, nationalism and capitalism. The novel was also notable as being part of a small revival of Australian science fiction in the 1960s. Its comic-horror tone was well received and a movie version was released in 1972 titled Night of the Lepus – a straight-faced monster movie that dropped the humor of the book. Summary Sir Alfred – who engineered Fitzgerald's election to prime minister – calls Fitzgerald one evening with a complaint: his Bludgerton property has been infested with rabbits that are immune to myxomatosis. Fearing another rabbit epidemic, Fitzgerald tasks Professor Welch and his scientists with inventing super myxomatosis, or Supermyx, to control the growing rabbit population. They test the first batch of Supermyx on a male and female rabbit, with disastrous results: Supermyx does not kill rabbits, and merely makes them savage, as if infected with rabies. Supermyx is, however, instantly lethal to humans, as demonstrated when Sir Alfred is brutally killed by the test cases, which then escape and turn the entire rabbit brood into flesh-rending Supermyx carriers. In a temporary lapse of brilliance, Sir Alan Jacks suggests that Fitzgerald weaponize Supermyx and conquer the world. Fitzgerald does just that: after nuking the Bludgerton property to prevent the rabbit outbreak (and having the scientists committed so that word of the threat never comes to light), he has Supermyx bombs planted in every country; as a demonstration of power, he wipes out the entire populations of two countries who refuse to stop warring with each other. This results in total nuclear disarmament, the exile of all nuclear physicists to a doomed island, and an eventual end to conventional warfare. Wars are soon conducted as harmless arena games which are heavily promoted like the Olympics. Fitzgerald has all weapon factories shut down, but this quickly threatens the world economy, so he decrees the factories continue producing weapons of warfare, which are then summarily dumped into the ocean. Surprisingly, Fitzgerald's seemingly ridiculous plans actually work: world peace finally becomes a reality for three years. As Supermyx cannot travel across bodies of water, Australia is completely safe from its own superweapons; however, the Supermyx- carrying Bludgerton Rabbits (now giant from atomic radiation) refuse to go away, and keep resurfacing time and again, threatening to overwhelm Australia and wipe out its population. The rabbits eventually become too numerous to contain, and Australia wages a one-sided war against the numberless brood. Fitzgerald is killed, and the entire continent is evacuated, leaving Australia to the aborigines, who eventually summon a flood to destroy the rabbits. The novel ends with the implication that the remaining Supermyx bombs will be detonated, wiping humanity from the face of the earth. Characters Kevin Sean Aloysius \\"Ella\\" Fitzgerald: Prime Minister of Australia, and the novel's protagonist. An archetypal scheming politician. Major General Sir Alan Jacks: Notoriously incompetent Minister of Defence whose predictions are always wrong, except for one temporary lapse of brilliance when he suggests using Supermyx as a world-dominating weapon. Sir Alfred Hill G.C.B.: Wealthy landowner, habitual blackmailer, and the story's catalyst. After discovering oil on his property he used his wealth to dominate two boroughs (pocket boroughs), which won Fitzgerald the last election by a two-seat majority. When rabbits begin spawning on his property, Alfred threatens to use the same trick to lose Fitzgerald the next election if he can't find a way to get rid of the rabbits. Professor Welch: Leader of the team that is tasked to develop Supermyxomatosis, in the hope of annihilating the rabbit plague on Sir Alfred's ranch. Les Dorfmann: Welch's second-in-command, who becomes a hunted fugitive, and later becomes Fitzgerald's last hope at defeating the deadly rabbits. Dr Miller: Assistant to professor Golovin, who helps Dorfmann escape the authorities, and later marries him. Flo Hill, AKA \\"Ladyill\\": Wife of Sir Alfred, who Fitzgerald was once infatuated with. Major Gary Cooper Hill: Son of Ladyill and Sir Alfred. Military man in the Australian army. Unlike the Minister of Defence, Gary is a highly competent and very effective leader. The Bludgerton Rabbits: Initially normal rabbits infesting Sir Alfred's Bludgerton property, they become savage plague-carriers when infected with Supermyx.

In 1948 he became the first Israeli ambassador to the United States, and between 1950 and 1959, he was Israel's ambassador to the United Kingdom. He was the President of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem from 1962 to 1968. Biography Epstein informed Harry S. Truman of the Israeli Declaration of Independence, which he wrote had been proclaimed \\"within the frontiers approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations in its Resolution of November 29, 1947\\". Epstein requested US recognition of the new state. Eliahu Eilat immigrated from Russia to Palestine in 1924, and spent a decade in Beirut as a student and journalist. Diplomatic career From 1934 to 1945 he worked for the Jewish Agency, which evolved into the government of Israel (as described by V. Jacobson in 1934 in “Report on my trip to Eretz Israel and Syria”, 12 May 1933). That same year he came to the United States as the agency's representative in Washington, D.C., and from 1948 to 1950 he served as the first Israeli ambassador to the United States. Following that appointment he served as the Israeli ambassador to the United Kingdom from 1950 to 1959. He was the president of Hebrew University from 1962 to 1968, following Giulio Racah and succeeded by Avraham Harman. During WWII, Elath visited Burma to meet with allied military leaders, including Major-General Orde Wingate. Elath was unaware that Wingate was a nudist and was said to have been \\"scarred for life by his experience of discussing Zionism for an hour and a half with a completely naked man\\".Donaldson, p. 652.

It is native to deep waters in the western North Atlantic from the Georges Bank off New England southward to the Blake Plateau off South Carolina. The species is found on the outer continental shelf and upper continental slope at a depth of 90–730 m and among dense beds of dead coral (Lophelia pertusa) rubble, their preferred habitat. The original type specimen was caught in a trawl off Atlantic City on March 1, 1946, and donated to the Academy of Natural Sciences by Carroll B. Atkinson. The name stigmaeus means \\"speckled\\" in Greek. The redeye gaper has a rounded, slightly compressed body and a very large head. The mouth is large, with a protruding lower jaw and teeth arranged in bands. The skin is soft, loose, and very pliable (especially on the underside), forming folds over much of the head and body. The fish is covered with minute spinules that give it a velvety texture. The lateral line system has prominent open canals. The pectoral fins are small, with 14 fin rays. The first dorsal fin ray is modified into an angling apparatus (the illicium) with a lure (the esca). The esca consists of a cluster of filaments of varying thickness and is black to blue to greenish gray in front, and brilliant white behind. The illicium has two dark rings, though this is faint or absent in a few individuals. The coloration is olive green above with large irregular blotches surrounded by smaller circular spots, extending into the rays of the dorsal, pectoral, and caudal fins. There is often a kidney- or figure-8-shaped blotch on the nape. These spots appear darker than the background in preserved specimens, but are a lighter greenish- yellow color in life. The underside is rose-colored with large, diffuse lighter patches; the red color extends up the sides of the head forward of the eyes, encompassing the jaws. The fin membranes are also shades of red. The iris is a deep rose red. This species attains a maximum of 30.5 cm total length. Redeye gapers are sedentary ambush predators that spend most of their time resting on the sea floor on their pectoral and pelvic fins, moving only to capture prey or avoid predators. They attract prey to them using their movable esca. If threatened, they raise themselves up on their pelvic fins and rapidly take in water to increase the size of their bodies. Redeye gapers are known to be able to survive the temperature and pressure changes from being brought to the surface.Wyanski, D.

Each local-area \\"Conference\\" in the North American Division of Seventh-day Adventists is in charge of running and operating their own camp. The ages of campers range anywhere between 7–18 years old, depending on the week at the camp. Each camp varies in the activities they manage but most have archery, swimming, horses, arts and crafts, nature, high ropes challenge course, and many other common activities found at non-Adventist camps. In addition to regular camps some have specialty camps, or RAD camps, which vary from either a week of surfing, waterskiing/wakeboarding, rock climbing, golf, skateboarding, whitewater rafting, paintball, mountain biking, cycling, basketball, BMX, and many others.  History  Camp meetings in the Adventist church trace back to the preceding Millerite movement led by William Miller. These in turn had influences from the existing Methodist camp meetings. The Millerites held more than 130 camp meetings from the earliest in summer 1842, to prior to Autumn 1844; with an estimated combined attendance of over half-a-million people. Media campaigns surrounding the camps extended their influence further.George R. Knight, A Brief History of Seventh-day Adventists, p18–19 Joshua V. Himes had a major role in the camps. He also pioneered the use of a tent for meetings. This tent could seat around 4,000 people, and was apparently the largest tent of its type up to that time in the United States. This history may relate little to the youth camp program of Adventists. It relates mainly to their camp meeting program. Camp locations In Australia, camp meeting is commonly known as \\"Big Camp\\".

It is located 153 kilometres north of Cotonou and 33 kilometres east of Abomey (Bohicon is even closer). History Za-Kpota dates back to 1645, when Fon settlers from Abomey and Bohicon settled there in order to develop farming and hunting. The first settlement was Adikogon. The name is derived from settlers who remarked \\"Za kpo O ta bo not Finin\\" which roughly means: \\"Sweep the rise and reside there.\\" Za-Kpota covers an area of 600 square kilometres and had 132,818 inhabitants with a Density of 570 inhabitants per km in 2002. The commune contains some 56 villages, mostly engaged in subsistence farming. Originally populated by Fons, the town now houses some Mahis, Yoruba and Dendi. Economy Economic activities that occupy people include agriculture (85%), trade (8%), crafts (5%) and other services (2%). However, the commune is living in poverty. Zakpota has a school with around 250 pupils, 80% of which are boys. Donations from the Netherlands have been geared towards improving female education in the commune. Za-Kpota was struck hard by the 2008 Benin floods in July 2008, tearing down mud and straw homes and infrastructure and polluting rivers. . Child trafficking In December 2003, Za-Kpota was the centre of a serious child trafficking scandal. It erupted after rival traffickers gave the Nigerian police pictures of children from Za-Kpota working arduously in quarries and farms in Nigeria, authorised by their parents due to extreme poverty. The police located 261 boys, aged 6–16 in Abeokuta in Ogun State and sent them back to Benin on trucks. Seven traffickers were arrested and incarcerated. The boys at the centre of the Za-Kpota Nigerian trafficking scandal were believed to represent only a small percentage of the total number of some 50,000 Beninese children which are believed to be a victim of cross-border child trafficking. In cooperation with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the government has set up village committees to stop child trafficking.

Murdock. Nitrogen Transformation Inhibitors and Controlled Release Urea. Extension Report. Lexington, KY: University of Kentucky College of Agriculture, 2005. It is found in granular or prill form, which allows urea to be easily stored, transported and applied in agricultural settings. It is also the cheapest form of granular nitrogen fertilizer. Since urea is not an oxidizer at standard temperature and pressure, it is safer to handle and less of a security risk than other common nitrogen fertilizers, such as ammonium nitrate. However, if urea is applied to the soil surface, a meaningful fraction of applied fertilizer nitrogen may be lost to the atmosphere as ammonia gas; this only occurs under certain conditions. Breakdown of urea For plants to absorb nitrogen from urea it must first be broken down: (NH_{2})_{2}CO + H_{2}O \\\\stackrel{urease}{\\\\rightarrow} NH_{3} + H_{2}NCOOH \\\\rightarrow2NH_{3(gas)} + CO_{2(gas)} Urease is a naturally occurring enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to unstable carbamic acid. Rapid decomposition of carbamic acid occurs without enzyme catalysis to form ammonia and carbon dioxide.Benini, Stefano, Wojciech R. Rypniewski, Keith S. Wilson, Silvia Miletti, Stefano Ciurli, and Stefano Mangani. 1999. A new proposal for urease mechanism based on the crystal structures of the native and inhibited enzyme from Bacilus pasteurii: why urea hydrolysis costs two nickels. Structure 7:205-216. The ammonia will likely escape to the atmosphere unless it reacts with water to form ammonium (NH4+) according to the following reaction: NH_{3(gas)} + H_{2}O \\\\rightarrow NH^{+}_{4} + OH^{-} This is important because ammonium is a plant available source of nitrogen while ammonia is not.Brady, Nyle C. and Ray R. Weil. The Nature and Properties of Soils. New York: Prentice Hall, 2001. Additionally, the formation of the hydroxide ion may cause soils around the applied urea particle to have a pH around 9.0 which increases ammonia volatilization. This area is also highly toxic due to elevated ammonia concentration for several hours so it is recommended that urea based fertilizers not be applied or banded with planted seed at a rate that exceeds 10–20 kg/ha, depending on the crop species.Wells, K.L., L.W. Murdock and H.F. Miller. Urea as a Source of Fertilizer Nitrogen for Crops in Kentucky. Extension Report. Lexington, KY: University of Kentucky College of Agriculture, 1978. It is important that there is adequate moisture because up to thirty percent of the available nitrogen can be lost through atmospheric volatilization within seventy-two hours of application.McInnes, K.J., et al. \\"Field measurements of Ammonia Loss from Surface Applications of Urea Solution to Bare Soil.\\" Agonomy Journal (1986): 192-196.  Management considerations Ammonia volatilization reduces the economic efficiency of agricultural cropping systems. Either yield will be reduced or additional costs will be incurred from additional nitrogen fertilizer. The amount of ammonia volatilization depends on several environmental factors, including temperature, pH, and the soil water content. Additionally, the amount of surface residue and time between urea application and precipitation are also critical. Generally speaking, volatilization will be lower when urea is applied during the wetter and cooler conditions that generally occur in early spring (March and April). However, drying surface soil and rising temperatures as spring progresses increases the probability of ammonia volatilization. Ideally, a manager should attempt to apply nitrogen immediately before a moderate rain event (0.1 inch), allowing urea to dissolve and move into the soil. However, this is not always possible. The soil's pH also has a strong effect on the amount of volatilization. Specifically, highly alkaline soils (pH~8.2 or higher) have proven to increase urea hydrolysis. One study has shown complete hydrolysis of urea within two days of application on such soils. In acidic soils (pH 5.2) the urea took twice as long to hydrolyze.Christianson, C.B., et al. \\"Microsite Reactions of Urea-nBTPT Fertilizer on the Soil Surface.\\" Soil Biology and Biochemistry (1993): 1107-1117. Surface residues, such as thatch and plant stubble exhibit increased urease activity. Soils that have high organic matter content also tend to have higher urease concentrations. More urease results in greater hydrolysis of urea and ammonia volatilization, particularly if urea fails to move into the soil.Torello W.A. and Wehner D.J.. “Urease Activity in a Kentucky Bluegrass Turf.” Agronomy Journal (1983): 654-656. Urease inhibitors Fertilizer is often applied when field conditions are not optimal, particularly in large scale operations. Most studies,McCarty, G.W., J.M. Bremmer and H.S. Chai. \\"Effects of N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide on hydrolysis of urea by plant, microbial and soil urease.\\" Biology and Fertility of Soils (1989): 123-127. indicate that nitrogen losses can be reduced in these situations when a urease inhibitor is applied to the fertilizer. Urease inhibitors prevent the urease enzyme from breaking down the urea. This increases the probability that urea will be absorbed into the soil after a rain event rather than volatilized into the atmosphere. This causes subsequent hydrolyzation to occur below the soil surface and decreases atmospheric losses. The use of inhibitors also decreases the localized zones of high pH common with untreated urea.Watson, C.J., et al. \\"Rate and mode of application of the urease inhibitor N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide on ammonia volatilization from surface-applied urea.\\" Soil Use and Management, British Society of Soil Science (2008): 1-7.

The commune covers an area of 750 square kilometres and as of 2013 had a population of 132,401 people.http://www.geohive.com/cntry/benin.aspx History The territorial entity that is today the municipality of Zagnanado has undergone several administrative changes since the colonial period until today. Since the early eighteenth century, the region depended on the kingdom of Abomey. Guézo made the area headquarters of the army during his campaigns against the Yoruba and Kétou of Abeokuta. By the Act of June 21, 1895, King Agoli-Agbo, he authorised full authority over the Agonlin region. In the early twentieth century, Zagnanado and surrounding villages were visited by many missionaries who spread Christianity. During the colonial period and into the 1970s, Agonlin remained a single administrative entity. However, in 1978 it was divided into three communes, Zagnanado, Covè and Ouinhi. Geography 3 rivers flow through the commune, the longest flows through for 93 kilometers. Zagnanado is bordered by Dassa-Zoumè to the north, Ouinhi and Zogbodomè to the south, Covè, Za-Kpota and Djidja to the west and Adja-Ouèrè and Kétou to the east. Administrative divisions Zagnanado is subdivided into six arrondissements, Agonlin-Houégbo, Banami, Don Tan, Dovi, Kpedekpo and Zagnanado. They contain 27 villages and 7 city districts. Demographics The population of Zagnanado is dominated by two major ethnic groups; Mahi representing 90.5% and Yoruba representing 8.1% and the rest minorities. The main religions are Christianity (47.2%), animism (30.5%) and Islam (2.8%). The population of the commune of Zagnanado, according to the 2002 census is 36,756 people, which is 6.1% of the population of the Zou Department. Data from the last census shows that from 1992 to 2002, the population Zagnanado experienced a small increase of 0.7% per year while between 1979 and 1992 growth was about 2.2% per year.

Portrayed by actress and comedian Stephanie Courtney, the character has developed a fan base on social networks and has become an iconic advertising mascot. Broadcast history The character debuted in 2008 through several television advertisements and has since appeared in radio, print, and web banners. The fictional upbeat store employee of Progressive Corporation was created by copywriter John Park and art director Steve Reepmeyer, at the Boston-based agency Arnold Worldwide. Flo has appeared in more than 100 advertisements. In 2011, Progressive introduced Flo's Australian counterpart, Kitty, played by Holly Austin. In 2014, other recurring characters were added to the advertisements. Jim Cashman plays Jamie, Flo's sidekick. In 2020, another Progressive employee was added, Mara, portrayed by Natalie Palamides. Overview Flo is a cashier and is recognizable by her extremely upbeat personality, sparkling white uniform, heavy makeup, and retro hairstyle. According to Courtney, it takes one hour to prepare Flo's hair and another to apply her make-up. Referring to her work in The Groundlings, she said, \\"Flo could be one of my improv characters, always on and sort of cracked in a weird way.\\" She thinks that the GEICO gecko \\"puts out more sexual vibes than Flo does\\". In November 2014, Progressive aired its 100th advertisement featuring Flo and introduced other members of her family including her mother, father, brother, sister, and grandfather. All of these characters were also played by Courtney, who was reported to have spent about 12 hours doing hair and makeup transitions for the recording. Reception In October 2009, the Boston Herald referred to Flo as \\"the commercial break's new sweetheart\\" and said Courtney was \\"attaining TV ad icon status\\". The same article also reported that she was the subject of a popular Halloween costume. There are multiple websites and social media groups dedicated to her, or talking about her. The volume of commercials and the type of humor is off-putting to others, described as \\"love her or hate her\\" or \\"badvertising\\". Advertising Age described Flo as \\"a weirdly sincere, post-modern Josephine the Plumber who just really wants to help. She has; the brand is flourishing.\\" This was later echoed in an article from Duane Dudek in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on May 20, 2014, who credits Flo for inspiring a new trend of female commercial pitch people and cementing her legacy alongside Josephine and Palmolive Dishwashing Detergent's Madge the Manicurist. Flo was added as a downloadable character in the video game ModNation Racers in late 2010, complete with her own Progressive kart.

Through his political activism during the civil rights era, he came to be known as the \\"Godfather of Black Politics.\\" Early life Born in Shelbyville, Tennessee, to Dr. Louis E. Martin Sr. and Willa Martin, Louis Jr. grew up in Savannah, Georgia. His father, a physician of Afro-Cuban ancestry, was a graduate of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. It was there that he met and married the former Willa Hill of nearby Shelbyville. Louis Jr. was their only son. Dr. Martin moved his family to Savannah when Louis Jr. was four years old, largely because the climate of southeast Georgia reminded him of the sub-tropical climate of his native Santiago, Cuba. It was in Savannah that Louis Jr. later met and married the former Gertrude Scott, his wife of 60 years. Newspaper career After first attending Fisk University, Martin went on to graduate from the University of Michigan in 1934, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in journalism. Following college, Martin traveled to his father's native Cuba, spending two years there as a freelance writer based in Havana. Returning to the United States in 1936, he was hired as a reporter with the Chicago Defender, a major black newspaper published in Chicago, Illinois. After just six months in Chicago he was asked to return to Michigan to help launch a new black newspaper, the Michigan Chronicle, serving as its first editor and publisher. Martin remained at the Chronicle for eleven years. Louis Martin was a founder of the National Newspaper Publishers Association, a group of black newspaper publishers. He was also (in 1970) a founder of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a research organization in Washington, D.C. providing technical support for black officeholders and scholars throughout the country; serving as its first chairman for eight years. Political career Originally recruited by R. Sargent Shriver, Martin joined the 1960 Presidential campaign of Senator John F. Kennedy. During the campaign, Martin was instrumental in persuading candidate Kennedy to place a telephone call to Coretta Scott King to express dismay over the jailing of her husband, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. That phone call was widely credited with helping Kennedy win a major portion of the black vote in the general election that year. It prompted Dr. King's father, the Reverend Martin Luther King Sr., a registered Republican, to vote for Democratic Presidential candidate Kennedy. Following the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963, Martin was among the few close Kennedy advisors to successfully make the transition to the new administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1967, as a trusted advisor, Martin was influential in President Johnson's decision to nominate Thurgood Marshall as the first black Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Of his close working relationship with Johnson it was said that They talked to each other in the shorthand of experienced political pros, according to Clifford Alexander, Special White House counsel and the first African-American Secretary of the United States Army. Secretary Alexander regarded Martin as his mentor. Among the other leading black public figures whom Martin helped raise to prominence was Vernon E. Jordan Jr., later a close adviser to President Bill Clinton. Martin helped recruit Jordan to head the National Urban League. Eddie Williams, president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies said it was surprising that Martin was largely unknown to the public at large, given his wide-ranging influence in the White House and his role in the development of black political power in the Democratic Party. \\"One reason for this is that in Washington, he was the consummate political insider,\\" Williams said. \\"He traversed the corridors of power for many years without calling attention to himself and his achievements.\\" According to Williams, it was in the Washington Post that Martin was first called the \\"Godfather of Black politics\\". On Monday, January 27, 1997, Louis Emanuel Martin Jr. died in Orange, California. He was 84. Notes In author Alex Poinsett's book Walking with Presidents Louis Martin recounts his first awareness of race and its peculiar significance in American society. His father was napping in a back room of his office when the receptionist rushed in excitedly saying: \\"You've got to get up. It's a white man!\\" Jolted awake, Dr. Martin rushed to the front waiting-room. Here, Martin reflects on this event that occurred in 1919 when he was seven years old: \\"I always regretted that my old man got up. It struck me that just being a white man made a hell of a lot of difference. It impressed me so much that I became a civil rights advocate at the age of seven. From that time forward, I kept looking for signs and studying people closely as I began to understand how crazy this society is.\\" In the Foreword to Poinsett's biography of Louis Martin, Vernon Jordan wrote: \\"…a testimony to the enthusiasm, wisdom, and optimism with which Louis Martin approached politics. For more than half a century he was an indefatigable participant in America's political affairs. After helping FDR with reelection in 1944, he went on to serve as advisor and assistant to Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and Carter, and along the way initiated generations of black people into the leadership ranks of the American political system. For me he not only was a teacher and a mentor but remained a steadfast friend and a constant source of inspiration. Louis was always immensely generous with his time, and I - like so many others - knew that I could call him anytime and hear that familiar greeting, 'What's up?' by which he meant 'fill me in and let's see what needs to be done'.\\" Career achievements *Michigan Chronicle, editor and publisher, 1936–47 *Chicago Defender, editor-in-chief, 1947–59, editor, 1969–78, columnist, 1987–97 *Democratic National Committee, deputy chairman, 1960–69 *Political advisor to President John F.

They were field railways (Feldbahnen) designed for the military transportation purposes.  History  Transportable Feldbahn track of the Decauville type As railways developed during the 19th century, the military also discovered the utility of this new mode of transport. In stark contrast to the rudimentary road network of the time, the railways could transport large quantities of supplies, heavy equipment and troops rapidly and efficiently. For operations to the front lines the military developed its own system of field railways (Feldbahnen), usually built to a narrow gauge. In addition to the general advantages of narrow gauge railways - they took up less space and could have tighter curves, for example - narrow gauge vehicles and track were more easily transportable and could be quickly moved to conform as the location of the front line changed. Unlike road transportation, the establishment of a Heeresfeldbahn required the construction of expensive and time-consuming railway infrastructure (albeit of simpler design than conventional railways). They were built by specialist troops trained by the military, known as Eisenbahnpioniere. As a war progressed prisoners of war were also employed. The Heeresfeldbahn is tied to this fixed infrastructure; under artillery bombardment or other acts of war it is not flexible enough compared with lorry transport. A Heeresfeldbahn can also be quickly captured and used by an army's opponents. This could become a major disadvantage if the army has to retreat and is unable to lift or destroy the railway quickly enough. Due to these disadvantages, the Heeresfeldbahn completely lost its importance in the second half of the 20th century and was replaced by road vehicles which were now more technically advanced, cross-country capable and did not require specially trained crews. In particularly difficult terrain, air transportation is now also used (especially helicopters). The use of military railways is now largely restricted to internal transportation functions on large military sites, e.g. for transportation at munitions depots. In addition there are Feldbahnen on some military training areas e.g. large targets may be mounted on tipper trucks that are hauled by motorised locomotives as mobile targets for live firing exercises.  Subsequent civilian use  A HF Class 160 D (ÖBB 699.1), converted to a tank engine, on the Steyrtalbahn In addition to the typical tasks of military field railways in war itself, they were also sometimes used for civilian tasks once the war was over or their military function was finished. Such duties were occasionally carried out by military units and sometimes they built long access lines. For example, in the 1870s, when the Imperial and Royal Military Railway built a supply line from Bosnian Brod to Zenica in Bosnia was quickly expanded into a fully operational narrow gauge railway for general use, thus founding the extensive railway network built to the so-called Bosnian gauge of 760 mm. Even after the First World War, when the Heeresfeldbahnen were used very widely, a number of routes were used for public transport. For example, the Grödnerbahn in Tyrol, now in South Tyrol - Alto Adige in Italy was built with 760 mm gauge, like the Fleimstalbahn - Ferrovia della Val di Fiemme, as a supply line to the Dolomite front. The narrow gauge Ohrid line from Skopje to Ohrid in Macedonia, over 200 km long with a gauge of 600 mm, was originally a military railway of this type. Transportable Feldbahn track materiel, locomotives and wagons were often sold to civilian companies after the cessation of hostilities and the politically driven disbandment of the troops responsible for them. This materiel was occasionally still in use for decades after the war's end. For example, in some peat works today there are still track sections from the Imperial Austrian Military Railway to be found and in Feldbahn museums there is a variety of steel relics to be seen.  Rolling stock  German Brigadelok preserved by a museum Usually special rolling stock was developed for Heeresfeldbahnen. Their locomotives, the so-called Heeresfeldbahnlokomotiven (lit: army field railway locomotives) or were characterised by their simple, rugged design, their ability to negotiate very tight curve radii and travel over extremely poor-quality trackbeds safely. These design features also made them interesting for civilian uses such as the forest railways (Waldbahnen) used in forestry or on civilian field railways (Feldbahnen).  Kasemattenbahn  A special type of Heeresfeldbahn is the Kasemattenbahn (lit: casemate railway), specifically for use in fortified military installations. It is usually used to ensure a reliable and copious provision of supplies inside the narrow passages of casemates. They are found, for example, on the Atlantic Wall, the fortified installations in the Ardennes and in fortified British harbours.

Prelude The Thirty were short of funds and this led them to persecute wealthy Athenians of whatever political views. Many fled to Boeotia and Corinth who offered asylum in defiance of Sparta. The campaign Map showing Phyle during the Phyle Campaign Both out of deference to Sparta and because of their cash shortage the Thirty Tyrants had left Athens' border forts ungarrisoned. This allowed a group of Athenian exiles to seize the fort of Phyle in 404/403 BCE. The leader of the exiles, initially only some 70 strong, was Thrasybulus who had a reputation as a moderate democrat, and thus was ideal to unite all democratic opponents of the Thirty. A force of Athenian cavalry and Spartans was sent against Phyle, but was defeated in two surprise attacks by Thrasybulus at the Battle of Phyle. Thrasybulus then marched on Piraeus and defeated the force the Thirty sent against him at the Battle of Munychia. Sparta first responded by sending Lysander with a force of mercenaries who clearly intended simply to restore the Thirty to power. Very quickly, however, Sparta sent King Pausanias with a levy of the Peloponnesian League. Pausanias defeated the democrats in the Battle of Piraeus. However he opened negotiations and accepted the restoration of democracy, nevertheless insisting on the separation of Eleusis as a safe haven for the oligarchs. Aftermath Lysander's faction at Sparta was furious and along with King Agis brought Pausanias to trial to the end of 403 BCE. The exact charge is uncertain but the essence was presumably that he had been soft on Athens. Fifteen of the Gerousia, including Agis, voted guilty and 14 against but all 5 Ephors voted non guilty so he was acquitted.

History The Simjurids originated as Turkic slaves (mameluks or ghilman) for the Samanid amirs.Bosworth, p. 175 They quickly rose to prominence thanks to their skills as military commanders and governors, along with their extensive estates in the Quhistan region which acted as a permanent power base.Treadwell Their founder and eponym, Simjur al-Dawati, was appointed to various governorships in eastern and central Iran, and helped the Samanids to expand their authority in that region. His son Ibrahim ibn Simjur was appointed as governor of Khurasan in 944/945, but only held it for a short time. After Ibrahim's death, his son Abu'l-Hasan Simjuri was invested with the governorship of Khurasan and served in that position for almost three decades. With the ascension of the child Nuh ibn Mansur to the Samanid amirate, Muhammad was able to gain greater autonomy from Bukhara for himself. He was a key figure in the struggles that wracked the Samanid state in the 970s and 980s. When he died, his son Abu Ali Simjuri took his father's place.

Rugby career Jones played for several second tier Welsh clubs in earlier years, including his home town Pontnewydd and local teams Blaenavon and Pill Harriers, before joining Newport in 1919. Jones was first selected for Wales in 1922 while representing Newport at club level. Evans first game was against England at the Cardiff Arms Park under the captaincy of Tom Parker. Wales scored a record eight tries against England and the selectors kept faith with Jones by giving him a place in the next game of the 1922 Five Nations Championship against Scotland. Wales drew with Scotland thanks to a late drop goal from Islwyn Evans. Jones played the last two games of the tournament, both resulting in Welsh victories giving Wales the Home Nation Championship. Unlike many of the 1922 squad, Jones was reselected for future Welsh games when he was chosen for the 1924 Five Nations Championship. More surprising as Jones had been suspended in August 1922 by the Welsh Rugby Union for encouraging younger players to switch codes from rugby union to the professional rugby league game. This decision was later over-turned and Jones was allowed to play rugby union again. Jones played two more games for Wales, the first against England saw him record his first international points when he scored a try, though this was not enough to prevent an English victory, Wales losing 17-9. His final game for Wales was the disastrous game against Scotland which Wales lost 35-10, Jones being one of six players to never represent Wales again.

The operation moved to Dundas Street near Parliament in Toronto. In 1966, more products were introduced including the YVM-1 \\"Voice Master\\", a portable 45 watt tube amplifier combined with a four-channel microphone mixer. The Voice Master contained 1/4-inch phone jacks for PA speakers, a master volume control, treble, mid-range and bass tone controls and patching points for the TR-1, a spring reverb unit made by Traynor. The portable mixer-amplifier concept was a novel idea that quickly proved popular among musicians, and was the inspiration for the 1967 introduction of the competing \\"Vocal Master\\" product line by Shure. In 1967, Yorkville expanded distribution westward to Vancouver and southward into the United States via Buffalo, New York. In 1969, Yorkville began designing larger concert equipment including eight-, sixteen- and 24-channel mixers with a pair of integral graphic equalizers, an audio snake and heavy folded-horn \\"W\\"-style bass bins loaded with 18-inch drivers. The sound contracting business also designed and used wedge-shaped monitor speakers on stage for artists to hear themselves.Yorkville Sound. Vintage Traynor Overview. Concurrently, Yorkville incorporated their Buffalo operation to create a US-based business entity: Yorkville Sound Inc. In 1970, the Canadian dollar ceased to be pegged to the American dollar and US dealers found their Yorkville prices suddenly jump 10% higher, followed quickly by another 10% added due to a short-lived US surtax on imported finished goods. In 1972, Yorkville expanded operations to Europe, opening offices in the UK and Sweden. In 1976, Peter Traynor sold his shares and left Yorkville Sound. The Traynor brand would be slowly phased out over the next 17 years, until it was reintroduced in 2000. Steve Long, son of founder Jack Long, began working full-time at Yorkville Sound in 1981 and eventually became company president. During the 1970s and 1980s, the company grew. Around 1981–1982, Yorkville Sound was contracted to fabricate loudspeaker enclosures for Martin Audio's North American market.

Broad Street in Columbus, Ohio. It was designed and built in 1926 by the American architect Thomas W. Lamb as part of the American Insurance Union Citadel (now LeVeque Tower). Today the theater functions as a multi-use performing arts venue. It is owned and operated by The Columbus Association for the Performing Arts. The Palace Theater's \\"house\\" is considered separate from LeVeque Tower, while the Marquee and lobby are part of the Leveque complex. History Sign The Palace Theatre was designed by Thomas W. Lamb in his signature \\"Adam\\" style, reminiscent of the 18th century neo-classical work of the Scottish architects James and Robert Adam. Originally named Keith-Albee Theatre, its construction was personally supervised by the vaudeville mogul Edward Albee of the Keith-Albee circuit. It opened in 1926 as the Keith-Albee Palace and featured live vaudeville along with silent feature films, an orchestra and Miss Buckeye, a wonderful Style 260 3/16 Mighty WurliTzer Theatre Pipe Organ. The Organ is now located at Thomas Worthington High School as of 1975. The dressing room tower in the backstage area was designed as a small hotel, complete with a “front desk,” where performers picked up their room keys and mail. Kitchen facilities and a children’s playroom were available. The dressing rooms are named after cities on the vaudeville touring routes. The under stage room includes an animal shower and small sanitary stable, along with a ramp built for hoofed animals to help facilitate their transport to and from the stage during the Vaudeville era. In 1929, the Palace was renamed the RKO (Radio Keith Orpheum) Palace. The theater was closed as a movie theater by RKO in 1975. It was later renovated and preserved by owner Katherine LeVeque as a home for Opera Columbus and touring Broadway shows. In 1989, the Palace Theatre was purchased by the non-profit theater management company CAPA, which consolidated its administrative functions with those of the Ohio Theatre. The Palace now hosts performances by the Columbus Symphony Orchestra, the Jazz Arts Group, the Broadway Series, and scores of CAPA- sponsored shows. While the insurance company behind the Citadel complex went bankrupt in the early 1930s, their financial mismanagement did not affect the day to day operations of the RKO Palace Theater. The Palace's Wurlitzer organ was removed in the 1960s by the Central Ohio Theatre Organ Society and is now installed at Thomas Worthington High School in Worthington, Ohio.

Portuguese neutrality ended in 1916 after the Portuguese seizure of German merchant ships resulted in the German Empire declaring war on Portugal. The expeditionary force was raised soon after and included around 55,000 soldiers. Background At the outbreak of the First World War, Portugal had declared its neutrality. The country remained neutral until 1916, though occasional skirmishes between Portuguese and German colonial troops occurred in Africa. In March 1916, the Portuguese Government seized a number of merchant ships belonging to the Central Powers which were anchored in Lisbon. The German government took this as a hostile act and declared war.Rodrigues The Government announced it would raise an expeditionary force to fight on the Western Front, with the first units being raised by July. In early 1917, the force was split into two elements: #Portuguese Expeditionary Corps (Corpo Expedicionário Português or CEP) – an infantry force of about 55,000 men, to operate under the control of the British First Army;Rodrigues #Independent Heavy Artillery Corps (Corpo de Artilharia Pesada Independente or CAPI) – an artillery force of nine batteries of heavy railway guns, manned by Portuguese gunners with artillery provided by France and the United Kingdom, to operate under the control of the French Army.Rodrigues Initially, CEP was constituted as a single reinforced infantry division, organized according to the Portuguese model, in which divisions were much larger than the British ones. Subsequently, it was decided to reorganize the CEP according to the British model, allowing it to become an army corps of two divisions and corps support troops, just by adding some additional battalions. This new organization would allow it to have sufficient autonomy to be able to take the responsibility for an entire independent sector of the Western Front.Henriques & Leitão Deployment of the CEP CEP soldiers loading a Stokes Mortar. Tamagnini and Gomes da Costa, together with General Haking. CEP troops in gas warfare training. CEP troops in bayonet training. CEP prisoners of war after the Battle of the Lys. A monument to the dead of the First World War in Coimbra. The CEP was shipped to France in early 1917, where the first groups received training in trench warfare and were equipped with British small arms.The Portuguese Army used the Mauser-Vergueiro rifle, with a 6.5mm cartridge; it was felt that supplying the ammunition for this would cause a logistical problem, and so the units received the British Lee–Enfield. The first units began to deploy in May, and a sector of the frontline was fully held by the CEP by November; by the end of October, just under 60,000 troops had been sent to France.Rodrigues From 6 November 1917, CEP took charge of the whole \\"Portuguese Sector\\" of the Western Front, with a total frontage of . In accordance with Allied practice, the sector included three lines of defense. The first included the front line (A-Line), the support line (B-Line) and the reserve line (C-Line). The second included the village line (brigade headquarters line) and the corps line. Finally, the army line formed the third line of defense.Henriques & Leitão The Portuguese Sector was divided into four brigade sectors. Each brigade deployed two battalions at the front (each defending a sub-sector of the brigade sector), one in support and another in reserve. Each of the CEP's two divisions controlled two brigade sectors, with a third brigade in reserve.Henriques & Leitão Combat service until the Lys CEP suffered the first German attack on 4 June 1917, made against Neuve-Chapelle sector. The attack was repelled by the 35th Portuguese Infantry Battalion, which had deployed to the front trenches just two days before. On the night of 12 June, a more intense German attack was carried out against Ferme du Bois and Neuve-Chapelle sectors, being repelled by the 2nd, 3rd and 7th infantry battalions.Henriques & Leitão On 14 August, the Germans launched a strong attack against the Portuguese lines. After an intense artillery bombardment, a Stosstruppen battalion assaulted the Neuve-Chapelle and Fauquissart sectors. In the defence against this attack, 2nd Lieutenant Hernâni Cidade of the 35th Infantry Battalion stood out, being able to capture several German prisoners, including the captain that led the assault. In another German assault on 14 September, 2nd Lieutenant Gomes Teixeira, of the 7th Infantry Battalion, led a counterattack with his platoon, killing the German commander and other men and capturing four prisoners. Another 2nd Lieutenant, David Neto from the 4th Infantry Battalion, only supported by his orderly, captured an entire German patrol made up of one officer and seven men on 13 December. For the actions of these officers, the A-Line (Front Line) became known by the Portuguese troops as the \\"Line of the 2nd Lieutenants\\".Henriques & Leitão These actions also made CEP one of the first units of First Army to comply with General Horne's request for the need to capture German prisoners for obtaining intelligence. This resulted in a commendation to the CEP from the First Army high command.Henriques & Leitão The First Army command recognized that the front of the Portuguese Sector was too long to be defended by only four brigades and reduced it to 12 km on 22 December 1917. From then on and until 6 April 1918, it was constituted, from left to right, by the brigade sectors of Fauquissart, Chapigny, Neuve-Chapelle and Ferme du Bois.Henriques & Leitão Morale was low throughout the winter of 1917–1918, partly due to bad weather and partly due to a perception among the soldiers that there was no reason for them to be in France. In December 1917, the Portuguese government was brought down; Sidónio Pais was declared to be the new president. The new government called the Portuguese support for the Allies into question and made it easier getting furlough. Many officers used this opportunity. Another factor was that the UK diverted its whole sea transport capacity for use by American forces after April 1917 when the United States declared war to Germany.www.remembrancetrails-northernfrance.com The Portuguese in the Great War Another major problem was a gradual loss of manpower; by April 1918, 10% of the CEP's strength had become casualties, due to the constant attrition of front-line service, and almost half of the officers were no longer present at the front. Replacements were not forthcoming, and so units became severely understrength: in order to cope, men were routinely denied leave, and units kept in the frontline for up to six months at a time, further lowering morale.Rodrigues From January 1918, the German activity intensified. On 2 March, a strong German attack was made against Chapigny and Neuve-Chapelle sectors, with a heavy artillery, gas, mortars and machine-gun fire preparation. At 5am, the Germans assaulted and took the Front Line, forcing the 4th Infantry Battalion to retreat to the Support Line. The Portuguese artillery reacted, launching about 1400 grenades against the Front Line. A counterattack made by the 4th Battalion, supported by 12th and 17th battalions, terminated the German attack. In this action, the Portuguese incurred 146 casualties and the Germans over 200. Despite the difficulties, CEP, not only withstood the violent activity of the Germans, but even took the initiative. On 9 March, under Captain Ribeiro de Carvalho, the 1st Company of the 21st Infantry Battalion, supported by a detachment of 25 sappers, launched a strong assault against the German lines in the Ferme du Bois sector area. In this assault, the Portuguese forces were able to kill and capture a great number of German soldiers and to demolish several enemy fortified positions, suffering themselves 20 casualties. On 18 March, a company made up of 100 volunteers from the 14th Infantry Battalion, under the command of Captain Vale d'Andrade, assaulted the German positions on the Neuve-Chapelle sector, capturing three prisoners.Henriques & Leitão CEP continued to have a pro-active attitude until the pull back of its 1st Division. Just three days before that happened, on the dawn of 3 April, a company of the 2nd Infantry Battalion, under Captain Américo Olavo, assaulted the positions of the German 81st Reserve Division in Chapigny sector, occupying its 1st and 2nd lines and demolishing them, before withdrawing under enemy artillery fire.Henriques & Leitão In April 1918, some cases of indiscipline began to be reported from amongst the men. These culminated in the mutiny of the exhausted 7th Infantry Battalion on 4 April, the men from the unit refusing to return to the frontline, from where they had left just a few days before. The decision was then taken to pull the CEP out of the frontline and replace it with British units. On 6 April, the 1st Division was pulled back,Rodrigues with the British 55th (West Lancashire) Division extending its lines southwards to fill part of the gap and the 2nd Division taking up the remaining section of the line, now under the operational control of the XI British Corps. The 2nd Division itself, now holding twice the normal divisional frontage, was scheduled to withdraw on 9 April and to be replaced by two British divisions. That morning, however, the Germans opposite launched a major attack, which would develop into the Battle of the Lys.Liddell Hart, p.402 The CEP in the Battle of the Lys The morning of 9 April found the CEP's 2nd Division with its 4th Brigade (Minho Brigade) in the frontline at the North, its 6th Brigade at the Centre and its 5th Brigade at the South. In a rear position, the 3rd Brigade (left as a reinforcement by the 1st Division) was in reserve. At about the 4am, the Germans started the Battle of the Lys with a violent bombardment, that lasted about two hours, made by 1700 artillery guns concentrated in front of the Portuguese sector. Despite the tremendous disadvantage, the Portuguese artillery immediately responded to the fire with their 80 guns. Map of German Lys offensive, 1918. At 7am, eight German divisions (35th Infantry, 42nd Infantry, 1st Bavarian Reserve and 8th Bavarian Reserve in the first wave and 8th Infantry, 117th Infantry, 81st Reserve and 10th Ersatz in the second wave) attacked the Portuguese line, with a manpower of around 100,000 men against the 20,000 Portuguese defenders. The 4th Portuguese Brigade (defending the northern sector, with the 8th and 20th infantry battalions in the front line, the 29th in support and the 3rd in reserve) was attacked by the 42nd German Division. The 8th Battalion, reinforced by the 29th, valiantly resisted in the first line to the assault. By 8am, the left flank of the Portuguese forces started to be enveloped by the Germans, who penetrated the gaps opened by the collapse and fall back of the 40th British Division's 119th Brigade. Under the German pressure, the Portuguese retreated to Laventie (4th Brigade's HQ), where they made their last stand, being overrun by 11am. The 35th German Division assaulted the central sector, defended by the 6th Portuguese Brigade, quickly overrunning its battalions in the front line (1st and 2nd battalions). The southern sector was assaulted by the 1st and 8th Bavarian Reserve divisions. The 8th Bavarian Reserve overran the 17th Battalion of the Portuguese 5th Brigade in the front line and the 11th Battalion of the 6th Brigade, which was in support. The 5th Brigade's 10th Battalion in the front line and the 4th in support were able to hold and slow the progression of the 1st Bavarian Reserve Division. Finally, the 1st Bavarian Reserve was able to reach the 5th Brigade's HQ in Canse du Raux, overrunning it at 1pm, with the brigade commander, Colonel Manuel Martins, being killed in the combat. By 10:30am the Portuguese artillery batteries, which never stopped firing, even after the infantry positions defending them had been annihilated, started to be overrun by the German forces. Most of them were able to resist and continued to fire until 11am. The bulk of 2nd Division ceased to exist as a fighting formation, retreating in such disarray that the divisional HQ had to relocate twice on 9 April.Rodrigues The mounted reserve held by XI British Corps was released to support the 3rd Portuguese Brigade in containing the German advance. The 1st King Edward's Horse and the 11th Cyclist Battalion were sent and joined the 13th (5th Brigade) and 15th (3rd Brigade) Portuguese battalions on the south end of the line, which held their ground until the next morning and prevented any further advances to the south or south-west.Liddell Hart, p.404 Here occurred the famous episode of the 15th Portuguese Battalion's soldier Aníbal Milhais (nickname \\"Soldier Millions\\") who, armed only with a Lewis gun, single-handedly defeated two German assaults by laying down intense fire, covering his Portuguese and British comrades, despite coming under heavy attack himself. The last group of these units, under the command of Captain Bento Roma of the 13th Battalion, was able to resist the Germans in Lacouture until 11:45am on 10 April. The main gap in the line was filled by the deployment of the British 50th (Northumbrian) Division and 51st (Highland) Division.Rodrigues It was later calculated that the CEP lost 400 dead, with around 6,500 taken prisoner, on 9 April, a third of its forces in the front line.Rodrigues The verdict after the Lys The – overwhelmingly negative – historical verdict on the battle was epitomized by the comment that the Portuguese \\"ruined Ludendorff and saved their allies by running away\\";Liddell Hart, p.401 whilst the German advance was superficially impressive, especially to begin with, it quickly lost momentum and stalled.Liddell Hart, pp. 405–6. However, it is likely that the collapse would have happened to any unit, not merely the weakened and demoralized Portuguese, as British troops in a similar position the previous month, in Operation Michael, had been overrun just as quickly.Rodrigues Subsequent actions of the CEP The remnants of the CEP were withdrawn for rear-area pioneer and security duties, though the 1st Division would later be returned to the front line for a short period. On 16 June 1918, the 1st Division, supplemented by British units, replaced the 14th British Division in the defence of the Liliers-Steenbekque line. In September 1918, already under the command of General Garcia Rosado, the remnants of the CEP started to be re-organised in order to re-enter combat. The objective was to form three brigades, composed of nine infantry battalions, that were to be organised with the remnants of the former CEP's original infantry units. By the end of October, four battalions were already combat-capable. These four infantry battalions (I, IV, VIII and IX battalions), together with several artillery, engineer, heavy machine gun and other remaining CEP units, participated in the Hundred Days Offensive. The last Portuguese combat action in World War I happened on the day of the Armistice. On 11 November 1918, under the command of Captain Barros Bastos, the 4th Company of the IV Infantry Battalion (former 23rd Battalion of the 1st Division) made the last assault against the Germans on the passage of the Scheldt river, Belgium. By the Armistice in 1918, the CEP had lost 2,160 dead, 5,224 wounded and 6,678 taken prisoner – 14,000 casualties and losses out of an establishment of 60,000.Rodrigues Composition *1st Division **1st Brigade (21st, 22nd, 28th and 34th infantry battalions and a 75 mm light mortar battery) **2nd Brigade (7th, 23rd, 24th and 25th infantry battalions and a 75 mm light mortar battery) **3rd Brigade (9th, 12th, 14th and 15th infantry battalions and a 75 mm light mortar battery) **Division troops ***3 x Heavy Machine-guns battalions ***3 x Artillery battalions ***3 x 152 mm mortar batteries ***236 mm mortar battery ***3 x Miners and Sappers companies ***Telegraph Company ***Motor battalion *2nd Division **4th (Minho) Brigade (3rd, 8th, 20th and 29th infantry battalions and a 75 mm light mortar battery) **5th Brigade (4th, 10th, 13th and 17th infantry battalions and a 75 mm light mortar battery) **6th Brigade (1st, 2nd, 5th and 11th infantry battalions and a 75 mm light mortar battery) **Division troops ***3 x Heavy Machine-guns battalions ***3 x Artillery battalions ***3 x 152 mm mortar batteries ***236 mm mortar battery ***3 x Miners and Sappers companies ***Telegraph Company ***Motor battalion *Corps troops **Cyclist battalion **Miners battalion *Army troops (under direct command of the British 1st Army): **Railway Battalion **Heavy Artillery Corps (10 x heavy howitzer batteries) *Aviation service (never activated as an operational unit, with its pilots and crew serving in French aviation squadrons) *Rearguard Base  Remembrance  * www.remembrancetrails- northernfrance.com Portuguese National Cemetery – Richebourg NotesReferences  * External links * Vidéos of Study day CADIST Péninsule ibérique - Université Toulouse Jean Jaurès / IRIEC *Bibliography proposed by CADIST Péninsule ibérique - Université Toulouse Jean Jaurès *Portugal na guerra - Selection of resources and digital documents by CADIST Péninsule ibérique - Université Toulouse Jean Jaurès Category:Military units and formations of Portugal Category:Corps of World War I Category:Military units and formations of Portugal in World War I Category:Expeditionary units and formations ","title":"Portuguese Expeditionary Corps"},{"id":"20797213","text":"\\"Hurt So Bad\\" is a song written by Teddy Randazzo, Bobby Weinstein, and Bobby Hart.

Little Anthony & The Imperials versionBackground= Little Anthony & The Imperials' original version was taken from their album, Goin' out of My Head. It was the follow-up to that album's smash-hit title song, and like that song, also became a Billboard Top 10 hit as well as a Top Five R&B; hit. This version reached number ten on the Billboard Hot 100. It was also performed by the group on their first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. It was written especially for The Imperials by Teddy Randazzo, a long-time friend of the group, along with Bobby Weinstein and Bobby Hart, and was produced by Don Costa for his DCP record label, later absorbed by United Artists Records and re-released on its Veep Records subsidiary. A powerful, dramatic ballad recording, it has become one of The Imperials' best-known songs, and has inspired numerous cover versions. =Personnel= *\\"Little Anthony\\" Gourdine - lead vocals *Clarence \\"Wah-Hoo\\" Collins - baritone/bass *Ernest Wright - second tenor *Sammy Strain - first tenor *Producer: Don Costa *Backed by The 101 Strings Orchestra El Chicano versionBackground= El Chicano released a cover of \\"Hurt So Bad\\" on their 1970 debut album Viva Tirado.

The project also holds a monthly gathering of anti-racist educators, whose goal is to end institutional racism in the education system. Purpose The mission of the Freedom School is to be a community-driven school where powerful and transformative popular education and learning are the norm and not the exception; where the whole person (body, heart, mind and soul) and the whole community are supported and challenged; where undoing racism, social justice, experiencing new worldviews, nonviolence and environmental sustainability are the curricular focus; and where diversity among individuals and communities and the unique developmental journey of each person is honored and celebrated. The South Seattle Emerald said the school \\"focuses on community organizing, learning a deeper analysis about racism and systems of oppression, and undoing racism in our society.\\" The school's training method is called \\"power analysis,\\" demonstrating how institutions affect people of color. Its purpose is raising students' consciousness of social justice issues, to create young anti-racist community organizers, according to Washington. The International Examiner reported the school \\"validates student experiences with racism and ties it with the structural context that students can see reflected widely in enduring racial gaps in food security and income, and racial disproportionality in school discipline and juvenile detention.\\" Most Tyree Scott Freedom School students are enrolled in the Seattle Public School District, which is the largest public school system in Washington State, having 45,572 students enrolled for the 2008-2009 school year. Of those students 43.0% are White and 57.0% are non-white. 35.8% of students do not live with both parents, 39.2% are eligible for free or reduced-lunch, 23.7% of students are Limited English and Equal English, and 14% of all students received special education services. These numbers are based on enrollment in 12 regular high schools, 10 middle schools, 9 K-8 schools, 58 elementary schools and 15 self-contained alternative schools including special education programs. HistoryAmerican Friends Service Committee= Freedom Schools were started in multiple states in the Civil Rights era, based on Charles Cobb's proposal for a nation-wide network of Freedom Schools in 1963. In 1964, activists had startet 30 freedom schools in Mississippi highlighting racial inequalities in the state's educational system. In the late 1990s, due to the efforts of the People's Institute in Seattle, the City of Seattle Undoing Institutional Racism Group, and their allies, there was renewed interest in challenging racial disparities within the education system. In 2001, the staff the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) along with The People's Instititue of Survival and Beyond, established the Seatle Freedom School. Two local groups which emerged from that effort were Youth Undoing Institutional Racism (YUIR), workshop’s activist arm, and Taking Care of Kids is Power. The American Friends Service Committee (AFSC) was among the community organizations that mentored YUIR, which conducted regular sessions with youth on a variety of issues relevant to their lives. YUIR and Taking Care of Kids is Power tackled the lack of multicultural curriculum, and racial disparities in discipline and achievement in the Seattle Public Schools. Youth trained themselves and testified at City Council Hearings and School Board Meetings. Successful citywide teach-ins organized by scores of parents, teachers and activists were conducted to focus on these issues. = Seattle Freedom School, 2001–2003 = These early efforts built momentum, and AFSC launched the first Seattle Freedom School in 2001. Dustin Washington, Community Justice Program Director (AFSC), and Katie Wepplo, Program Assistant (AFSC), served as the primary organizers. Washington said, \\"We were inspired by the Freedom Schools taking place in Oakland and New Orleans... we saw that our young people were not being exposed to the social justice issues that effect their lives and wanted to offer an alternative to the mainstream public and private education experience.\\" The 2001 Seattle Freedom School was a five-day organizing workshop which taught about 20 youth and young adults about racism, sexism, homophobia, and social justice. Organizers worked to develop anti-racist community organizing skills in young people and develop their leadership in a respectful and caring environment. = Tyree Scott Freedom School, 2003–present = In 2003, Freedom School was named in honor of the community organizer Tyree Scott, who died that year. For five decades Scott worked as a community organizer in Seattle, fighting discriminatory hiring practices, breaking through racial barriers in the trade unions, starting worker-to-worker programs which linked the struggle of American workers to workers overseas, and co-founding the Northwest Labor and Employment Law Office (LELO). In 1970 the American Friends Service Committee gave Tyree Scott financial support to start a new community-based organization that organized workers of color to fight discrimination in the unions and in the construction trades, called the United Construction Workers Association. The school's lead organizer Senait Brown said, \\"We’re not here to teach kids what to think, but how to think... Most education doesn't provide kids with a racial or structural analysis of the world they’re living in, so they just accept what they’re told.\\" Today Freedom School is facilitated almost entirely by former participants who have taken leadership over its development. Former Freedom School students and facilitators are engaged in anti-racist community organizing at Stanford University, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in Camden, New Jersey, at Western Washington University, at the University of Washington, and elsewhere. According to The Seattle Times, funding agencies include AFSC, Youth Undoing Institutional Racism, and The People’s Institute for Survival and Beyond Northwest. Curriculum The Tyree Scott Freedom School workshops are offered during winter and summer breaks and on several weekends. Curriculum follows in the footsteps of the Freedom Schools of the 1960s and learns from current Freedom School programs in other cities around the country. Whereas civil rights era Freedom Schools dealt primarily with legalized segregation, Tyree Scott Freedom School focuses on addressing the culture of institutional racism. Seattle Post-Intelligencer reportetd, \\"At the core of the institute training is a method called 'power analysis,' an examination of how institutional structures such as schools, housing and the prison system affect people of color.\\" Curriculum also incorporates understandings of internalized racial oppression developed by the People's Institute, based on Joy Leary's research on post-traumatic slavery, and Edwin Nichols' model for understanding cultural racism. Curriculum is based around the Undoing Racism principles of the People's Institute including learning from history, sharing culture, developing leadership, maintaining accountability, networking, understanding power and gate keeping, and undoing internalized racial oppression. Participants analyze why people are poor; develop power analyses; define racism; learn principles of organizing; learn African American, Native American, Latino and Asian history; and discuss intersections of racism with sexism and heterosexism (homophobia). Freedom School students participate in various field trips. An environmental-justice tour of South Seattle exposes the effects of environmental racism to local communities. Youth visit a Duwamish river Superfund site, Mara Farms community garden, and the former site of Longs Paint Co. in South Park, a factory that local residents (suffering from asthma and other pollution-related health problems) organized to have removed. A tour of the International District (historic Chinatown) visits Danny Woo community garden, the Bulosan Memorial Exhibit, and the Panama Hotel, which provides a unique glimpse at items left behind by Japanese Americans who were interned during WWII and never returned to Seattle to claim their belongings. A tour of El Centro de la Raza exposes youth to the rich local history of Latino organizing, including the peaceful occupation of the Beacon Hill School in 1972. A Black Panther Party tour of the Central District takes youth to the former headquarters of the party, exposes them to the Ten Point Platform, and gives them the opportunity to questions of Aaron Dixon, former Black Panther and founder of the Seattle chapter. Curriculum is specifically designed to reflect the needs of the participants, young people between the ages of fifteen and twenty-one. 85% of the youth who attend are low-income and are youth of color. Although the majority comes from Seattle, youth from across Washington State often come as well. Freedom School is free to attend, and breakfast snacks and lunch are provided each six-hour day. All participants must stay the entire time, because each activity builds on the previous one and an important goal is for the group to develop a common language and understanding around the issues they discuss. Freedom School curriculum is inclusive and interactive with small breakout groups, physical activities, and much discussion time. Freedom School also presents opportunities for young people to meet with and hold discussions with community and national leaders. In 2006, for example, Freedom School students met in small groups with Seattle City Council members; King County Commissioners; representatives from the foster-care system, and experienced community organizers. This gave the young people a chance to speak truth to power, ask hard questions of community leaders, and utilize the information that they learned through Freedom School. In the future Tyree Scott Freedom School organizers work towards making Freedom School a year- round, institutionalized alternative school using its own methodology of popular-education-style teaching that will truly engage young people around their experiences. Organizers are working to develop a core of teachers fully equipped as multicultural educators, involve families and community in the education process, and advocate a holistic approach to education which incorporates service learning and a global perspective. In a community-driven process, Freedom School organizers are developing a curriculum for accreditation by the Washington State Office of Public Instruction. ReferencesFurther reading *William A.

It tells the story of famous children from history stolen by futuristic time travelers from their place in time and accidentally sent to the 21st century as babies. They are then adopted by families in the 21st century. Because Jonah is one of the stolen children, he, along with his non- adopted sister Katherine, must help return the missing kids to their rightful places in history and fix time before it is destroyed. The first book in the series, Found, was published on April 22, 2008. The series continued with book titles Sent, Sabotaged, Torn, Caught, Risked (originally intended to be titled Kept), and Revealed. The eighth and final book, Redeemed, was released on September 8, 2015. There are also two ebook short stories, Sought (which takes place before Risked) and Rescued (which takes place between Risked and Revealed). Haddix originally intended the series to consist of only seven books, however, she stated that she had trouble closing out the series in seven books; leading to her decision to write Redeemed. BooksFound= A thirteen-year-old boy named Jonah had always known that he was adopted and had never thought much of it until he began receiving strange letters sent to his house. When Jonah's friend Chip, who received the same letters, learns that he is also adopted, Jonah, Chip and Jonah's sister, Katherine, set out to find out the truth about their origins. They end up in the middle of FBI investigation, people appearing and disappearing, and a strange tale from a woman named Angela DuPre, who saw a plane appear (and later disappear) from nowhere, and discovered 36 babies on board, minus pilot and copilot. The three come to realize that Jonah and Chip are important missing children from history who were transported to the 21st century by baby smuggling time travelers, whose names are Gary and Hodge. Later, they are unknowingly lured into a cave, known as a time hollow, with all but one of the other 36 missing children in an attempt by the smugglers to take them to the future. After they have defeated the smugglers, another time traveler from the future known to them as JB (Janitor Boy) decides to send Chip and another boy, Alex Curtis, back to the 1480s, where they were originally taken from. While trying to stop him, Jonah and Katherine are accidentally taken along for the trip as well, leaving it up to them to save their friends and return to the 21st century. This sets the plot and the title for the following book in the series, \\"Sent\\". Found was released on April 22, 2008. \\"Found\\" by Margaret Peterson Haddix copyright 2008 =Sent= right In this book, Jonah, Katherine, Chip, and Chip's real brother, Alex, have one warning of disaster before they are sent back to 15th century to the Tower of London, with the promise that they can return to their home in the 21st century if they can repair history. They quickly discover that Chip and Alex's true identities are Edward V (king of England) and Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York, respectively. But before Chip can enjoy being the King of England, they discover that they are virtually prisoners—and that the boys' uncle, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, wants them dead. Jonah and Katherine must repair time and save Chip and Alex from their certain deaths before it is even possible that they can return home. After ending up in the Tower of London, the four discover Chip and Alex's true identities, but find them prisoners. They foil an attempt by two men to kill Chip and Alex, but then must hide. The next day, they decide to do something and end up crossing the Thames to Westminster Abbey, where the boys' uncle, Richard of Gloucester, is being crowned King Richard III. Posing as angels, they terrify King Richard by telling that his murder of his nephews means that he is condemned to hell, leaving him with a burden of guilt and terror of damnation that lasts throughout his reign. They visit the queen, their mother, in sanctuary at Westminster, intending to convince her of Chip and Alex's death, but instead Chip and Alex rejoin their tracers (which mark out the events of original time) and Jonah and Katherine are removed from time to a time hollow, where they and JB watch the next two years, from 1483 to 1485. Jonah and Katherine are sent to the Battle of Bosworth Field and manage to convince King Richard to give up his crown in favor of Edward (Chip), but he is killed in battle and Chip and Alex are almost killed, before Jonah and Katherine manage to convince them to come home. They return to the time cave, and then go home. JB soon shows up at Chip's house and explain to him, Alex, Jonah and Katherine that Chip was never meant to be king and that Richard III was meant to be a villain for the sake of furthering humanity's moral development, as the incident with his nephews had made the murder of children no longer acceptable as an option for those involved in governance. JB then tells the four that he wants Jonah and Katherine to help the next missing child, Andrea Crowell, return to her place in history. Sent was released on August 25, 2009. \\"Sent\\" by Margaret Peterson Haddix copyright 2009 =Sabotaged= right In this third volume of the series, Jonah and Katherine return Andrea, identified as the missing child Virginia Dare, to 1600, her correct time period from where she was kidnapped; she had been taken while in the process of burying the people and animals of the Lost Colony of Roanoke as per Croatoan Indian custom and had to finish the job, otherwise the island's legacy would poison relations between the Jamestown colonists who would be arriving in a few years and the local Native Americans and cause the colony to fail, creating major damage to history. During Jonah, Katherine and Andrea's time journey, the device used for their time travel, called an Elucidator, is lost, causing the children to arrive at Croatoan Island in 1600 not certain as to where or when they are. They discover that a man visited Andrea and wrongly convinced her to type in a code on the Elucidator which made it disappear, telling her it would take her back to the day her parents died, so she could rescue them. Eventually, they discover that they made it to Roanoke Island in 1600, and go to Croatoan Island. In the process, Andrea saves a man from drowning, who they discover is her grandfather, John White. Jonah, Katherine, and Andrea find that their attempt to fix time by sending Andrea back is being thwarted by a man who calls himself Second. Second is a projectionist (computer simulation and prediction specialist) for the time agency that may have messed up time forever. Along the way they meet two of the other missing children, Brendan and Antonio, who were mysteriously sent back to their original time by Second. While on Croatoan Island, Andrea changes time itself and is reunited with her grandfather as Virginia Dare. It turns out Brendan and Antonio are adopted Native Americans, Brendan an African boy dumped off a Spanish slave ship, Antonio an orphaned Spaniard fled from service as a cabin boy, both taken into the Croatoan tribe, who became excellent artists, and that Virginia Dare/Andrea originally buried the bones on Croatoan Island that she was supposed to bury, saving it from being a reminder of the plague that killed the Roanoke colonists and Croatoan Indians. Second appears and Jonah and Katherine are saved by JB, only to be hurled into another time (1611). Sabotaged was released on August 24, 2010. \\"Sabotaged\\" by Margaret Peterson Haddix copyright 2010 =Torn= right Jonah and Katherine land on the decks of Henry Hudson's ship, called the Discovery, moments before a mutiny in the early 17th century. JB reveals that John Hudson, one of the kids stolen from history and Henry Hudson's son, is missing completely, and Jonah will have to play his part. Jonah and Katherine must survive being on the 17th century boat, with unlikely help from two of the sailors. Hudson is trying to find the Northwest Passage that would connect Europe and Asia by way of the Americas. A mutiny takes place on the ship, the Discovery, soon after they arrive, and they, along with Hudson and his officers, are banished into the cold bay. But instead of the original version they remember, the boat returns for them, led by the first mate. When they find out that Second has disguised himself as Hudson's first mate and has murdered one of them, Jonah and Katherine have a harrowing time, and then relive the mutiny and banishment, except time splits, showing 1 version that they already lived (the return of the ship), and 1 that they live now (continued banishment, the original version). They escape the boat after a docking and manage to get into the Damaged Time of 1605. They save their friends Brendan, Antonio, Andrea, JB and John White when Jonah rescues everyone from the fire in the Indian village of 1605. It then turns out that Second sent John Hudson to 1605. John Hudson, called Dalton Sullivan in the 21st century, was already in 1605, living in England. JB then concludes that Second unraveled time from 1605 to 1611, made his own new, alternate universe and is sealing it off completely from others. JB then sends everyone to the 21st century, where they can live in peace, for a while. Torn was released on August 23, 2011. \\"Torn\\" by Margaret Peterson Haddix copyright 2011 =Caught= Jonah and Katherine are in school when time freezes. They are subsequently transported to Albert Einstein's apartment in Bern in August 1903, just before his wife Mileva enters with a telegram from her parents in Novi Sad, Serbia informing them that their daughter Lieserl, who was left with Mileva's parents, is very ill with scarlet fever. As Mileva enters the apartment, she bumps into Jonah, who has commanded his Elucidator to make him and Katherine invisible; he drops the device, which has made itself look like a compass to disguise itself, and Mileva picks it up. Jonah and Katherine, still invisible, poke through the Einsteins' private papers after they go to bed, and then follow Mileva through the streets of Bern onto the train to Novi Sad in the morning. On the train, Mileva becomes aware of their presence. They then follow Mileva to her parents' house and conceal themselves in Lieserl's room for about a month. Then Emily, one of the other girls from the time cave, appears in the room, telling Jonah and Katherine she was sent back by JB, who told her she would find out what she needed to know when she arrived at her destination. Just before Mileva enters the room, Jonah persuades Emily to merge with her tracer as Lieserl in order to conceal herself. Mileva, demanding that Jonah and Katherine cure her daughter, takes Lieserl and leads them out into the nearby woods; she uses the Elucidator to render them visible, and is chagrined to find they are only children. Emily, unable to endure Lieserl's high fever and shortness of breath any longer, then separates from the tracer, causing Mileva to go into hysterics, until Jonah tells her that Lieserl is not dead, and introduces Mileva to Emily as Lieserl. When Mileva tries to show Albert the 13-year-old Emily, time freezes in 1903 as well, but not Mileva, since she skipped time to when Albert arrived. They are all sent, along with Emily, to a place outside of time, called a time hollow. Mileva freezes everyone there using the Elucidator and then watches her whole life, Emily's life, and learns English to understand how time travel worked. Then she unfreezes only Jonah and allows him to come with her and save time. Jonah lets Mileva keep the Elucidator when she returns to her time, which allows her to later send her demented son, Tete Einstein, to the future as a baby, where he grows up to become JB. Caught was released on September 3, 2012. \\"Caught\\" by Margaret Peterson Haddix copyright 2012 =Risked= Right after Jonah, Katherine and Chip meet a girl named Daniella McCarthy, the four are kidnapped by a boy, Gavin Danes, and sent to 1918. It is revealed that Gavin and Daniella are Alexei and Anastasia Romanov, the youngest children of Czar Nicholas II. Everybody except Chip is arrested upon arrival, who rescues Jonah and Katherine and discovers that Yakov Yurovsky intends to kill the Romanovs. Yurovsky successfully lures the imperial family into the cellar and proceeds with the killings. Gary and Hodge, who tricked Gavin and escaped from time prison, try to send all of them, including Maria Romanova and Leonid Sednev, to the future as babies, but they escape, though significantly younger. They regain their ages. Jonah and Gavin are shot in the ensuing chaos, but JB appears and rescues Jonah and Katherine. Katherine later returns to save the others, including Maria and Leonid, but the four older Romanovs are killed. JB sends Jonah and Gavin to the future, where they are forced to stay while they recover from their injuries. It is shown that Angela is providing for Maria and Leonid's education and considering adopting them in the 21st century. The book was released on September 4, 2013. \\"Risked\\" by Margaret Peterson Haddix copyright 2013 =Revealed= Charles Lindbergh appears in the Skidmores' home, grabs Katherine, and vanishes. Jonah finds out that Chip, Andrea, and all the other children from the plane have disappeared as well. Jonah’s parents and all the other adults in his town have \\"un-aged\\" into 13-year-olds. Jonah is the only 'normal' person left, and must save everyone with the help of un-aged JB and Angela.Jonah accidentally makes another dimension when he delivers what he thinks is himself as a baby, but is really his twin brother that he never knew about, to his parents, thinking that they and he are trapped in a doomed dimension anyway. Jonah discovers Gary and Hodge's plot: they convinced a grief-ridden Charles Lindbergh, reeling from the kidnapping of his son in 1932, that Jonah is his son and that he could have him back if he went to the night of the time crash and took the plane of babies to the future, cleaning up their mess and creating separate dimensions (and, in their plan, unaging Lindbergh himself as well). He convinces Lindbergh to return Katherine as well as to betray Gary and Hodge who are subsequently unaged into babies. Staying true to its name, Jonah's real identity as a missing child is finally \\"revealed\\" in this book; an orphanage baby from 1932 who was kidnapped to be passed off as Charles Lindbergh's son. Jonah finds out that the baby he saved was actually his twin (whom his parents named Jordan in the other dimension) and that though the dimensions were separate, they have now merged, meaning that Jordan and Jonah share a dimension, and contrary to Mom, Dad, and Katherine, have no memory of each other, since the others were in both dimensions. Jonah tries to take the first step in bringing the family, including Jordan, together afterward by having a big family hug. Revealed was released on September 2, 2014. \\"Revealed\\" by Margaret Peterson Haddix copyright 2014 =Redeemed= Jordan Skidmore learns that he was an orphanage child from 1932 and that he now has a new twin brother named Jonah. Wanting to help his strangely unaged parents, he sends his entire family to the future. Second traps his parents in a time hollow and Jonah, Jordan, and Katherine are forced to save a young version of Second, Kevin, from an accident in the past (falling from a fence at the airport the night of the time crash). They learn Second's story: having witnessed the appearance of the plane, he was kept on for the FBI investigation, but crippled from his accident, and Gary and Hodge, acting for Interchronological Rescue, hired him as a spy in the time agency for the company, taking him to the future and healing him, where he became JB's chief projectionist. The adult Second, frustrated with Jonah and Katherine, later traps them in a separate time hollow, leaving Jordan to save time by himself. In a time hollow, he watches the entire lives of his siblings and learns about their previous trips through time. Second reveals that he has been murdered and that he is only a hologram, and the fate of the alternate universe he created- destroyed, since he gave the secret of age-altering to everyone. After befriending Kevin, Jordan convinces him to help re-age the adults. In the process of doing so, Kevin himself is unaged into a baby. The two are captured by Curtis Rathbone, the CEO of the company that employed Gary and Hodge, who then reveals that he caused all the unaging. Jordan and Kevin are then joined by Jonah, Katherine, Chip, JB, Angela and his parents. Everybody is frozen by Mr. Rathbone but he is killed by Kevin's Elucidator. In the epilogue, Kevin is adopted by the Skidmores, and babies Gary and Hodge by Hadley Correo and Angela, bringing them up to 4 adopted kids (including Maria and Leonid from Risked . JB reveals to them that the time agency is sealing off time travel to prevent any more near-disasters, but secretly gives them an emergency Elucidator. Redeemed was released on September 8, 2015. \\"Redeemed\\" by Margaret Peterson Haddix copyright 2015  Shorts  2 E-book shorts have been released in 2013 and 2014 respectively, titled Sought and Rescued. CharactersProtagonists (in order of appearance)= *Jonah Skidmore - Jonah is the 13-year-old main character in the series. He is one of the famous children of history that were kidnapped by time travelers and accidentally sent to the 21st century. He is the adopted brother of Katherine Skidmore and the adopted son of Michael and Linda Skidmore. Jonah is helping to restore history caused by the kidnappings. He faces the struggle of figuring out who he is as one of the missing children of history. In Revealed he discovers that while he was listed under Charles Lindbergh on the plane, he was not a famous kid in original time, and Gary and Hodge only kidnapped him to pass him off as Charles Lindbergh's son. Jonah has light brown hair and pale skin with occasional freckles. He has big blue eyes and dimples. He is taller than Katherine *Katherine Skidmore - Jonah's one year younger sister and a main character of the series. Even though she is not a missing child of history, Katherine has decided to help Jonah. She also comes up with JB's nickname, which stands for \\"Janitor Boy.\\" She called JB \\"Cute Janitor Boy\\" before she knew what he really was. Katherine is slim and has wispy blonde hair, brown eyes, and a ski-slope nose. *Charles Haddingford \\"Chip\\" Winston III (King Edward V) - Jonah's friend and Alex's older brother. One of the missing children of history, Chip and Alex are particularly famous for their disappearance. Both boys' pasts were restored in Sent. He becomes Katherine's boyfriend after their adventures in Sent. *JB (Tete Einstein) - A time traveler from the future who helps Jonah and Katherine restore time. He knows the rules of time traveling and guides Jonah and Katherine in many of their journeys. He is the son of Albert Einstein and brother to Emily Quinn (Lieserl Einstein). He was sent forward in time by his mother, Mileva Einstein, to a point in time when his mental illness could be cured so that he could live a normal life. He then grew up to become the time traveler Jonah and Katherine know as \\"JB\\". *Alex Polchak (Richard, Duke of York) - Chip's younger brother. As one of the missing children of history, Alex has been adopted by different people than Chip. Less is known about Alex as he appears later in the first book and less personal information is given. His past is restored in Sent with Chip's. *Angela DuPre - An ally of Jonah and Katherine. Angela was one of the few people to have seen the missing children before the event was covered up. In the prologue of Found, she discovered the missing children of history when she saw the babies inside of a plane at the airport where she worked. In Revealed she plays a prominent role of helping Jonah save time. She eventually, along with Hadley, adopts Maria Romanova, Leonid Sednev, and the baby versions of Gary and Hodge. *Hadley Correo - A time agent from the future who sometimes works with JB and assisted Jonah and the others when they traveled to 1485. In Revealed, he played an important role in Jordan's adoption by the Skidmores. He eventually \\"moves\\" to the twenty-first century to be with Angela and their adopted family. *Andrea Crowell (Virginia Dare) - Another missing child of history, Andrea is the famous Virginia Dare, the first English child born in the American colonies. She, along with the rest of the mysterious Roanoke Colony, disappeared during the years her grandfather, John White was gone. Her past was restored in Sabotaged. Jonah developed a small crush on her over time and the two began a relationship in the epilogue of Redeemed. *Brendan (One Who Survives Much) - An obscure missing child, Brendan was originally a painter and a member of a neighboring Indian tribe. He was apprenticed by John White along with Antonio; most of their works were demolished in a fire, while the rest were taken illegally by time travelers. His past was restored in Sabotaged. *Antonio (Walks with Pride)- Like Brendan, most of Antonio's past is unknown except that he was a painter and a member of a neighboring tribe to the Roanoke Colony. He was also apprenticed to White as a painter and later had most of his works destroyed in a fire. His past was restored in Sabotaged. *Dalton Sullivan (John Hudson) - A missing child of history, the son of the explorer Henry Hudson who was put out to sea with his father during a mutiny in northwest Canada. Dalton never relived his past due to Second's interference but instead Jonah played his part in Torn. *Emily Quinn (Lieserl Einstein) - Another missing child of history, Emily is Albert Einstein's illegitimate daughter. She was only briefly mentioned and presumed dead by scarlet fever after 1903, a year after her birth in original time. She is also JB's sister. Her past was restored in Caught. *Daniella McCarthy (Anastasia Romanova) - Stolen from 1918 with her brother Alexei, Daniella is the youngest grand duchess and daughter of Czar Nicholas II. She was originally killed with the other Romanovs in 1918. She was the only one of the thirty-six kids from the plane that was absent from the adoption conference in Found, which resulted in her not learning about her true identity until the beginning of Risked, the novel where her past is restored. The short story Sought is told from her point of view. *Gavin Danes (Alexei Romanov) - Stolen from 1918 along with his older sister Anastasia Nikolaevna (Romanova), Gavin is the only son of Czar Nicholas II and heir to the throne of Russia. Stricken with hemophilia, Gavin was originally a sarcastic, mean boy, who wanted to take Gary and Hodge's offer and go to the future, but changed his mind and befriended Jonah, Chip, Katherine, and Daniella. His past was restored in Risked. *Jordan Skidmore - Jonah's twin brother who, like Jonah, originally died from starvation at an orphanage in 1932. He was kidnapped by Gary and Hodge in Revealed to trick Jonah into thinking the baby was himself, which would create a paradox and destroy time. He was rescued by Jonah and grew up in the twenty-first century in a separate dimension from most of the other characters. He is the main character in Redeemed. =Antagonists (in order of appearance)= *Gary and Hodge - The pair of original time kidnappers that gathered up all of the missing children in the first book. They are sent to time prison by JB, but Gavin releases them, not knowing the consequences. They are eventually unaged and adopted by Angela and Hadley. *Second Chance (Sam 'Kevin' Chase) - Abused as a child by his father, he became an expert hacker and ran away from home at the age of 13. In original time, he died from injuries caused by falling from an airport fence, but witnessing the time crash led to him being hired by Interchronological Rescue and sent to spy on the time agency. There, he was JB's projectionist, before manipulating and splitting time in Sabotaged and Torn, resulting in him being fired. He has also gone back in time to \\"help\\" Jonah and Katherine. In Redeemed, the adult version of him is killed by Mr. Rathbone. The young version of him is rescued by Jordan, and he is adopted by the Skidmores. *Curtis Rathbone - CEO of Interchronological Rescue, the company that steals babies from the past and sells them in the future to become rich. He employed Gary, Hodge and Second, though he was eventually betrayed by the latter. He was known to treat his employees poorly. He was killed in Redeemed and Interchronological Rescue was shut down by the time agency.

It is dedicated exclusively to the small Asian ape, the gibbon, and houses the most varied group of gibbons in the Western Hemisphere, including representatives of all 4 genera and 5 of the existing 19 species. The average population of the GCC is approximately 40 gibbons, housed in family groups. The GCC is a registered 501c3 non-profit tax-exempt organization, supported by donations, a small staff and many volunteers. The GCC is open to the public for tours on weekends and by special arrangement. Students and anthropology/biology researchers regularly conduct projects and observations at the Gibbon Conservation Center. The goals of the GCC include: to help ensure the conservation and survival of all gibbon species in the wild and in captivity; to provide a captive haven for all gibbon species as a complement to protecting them in the wild; to educate the public and add to the knowledge on gibbons for the scientific community, rehabilitation centers, and zoos and to support ongoing field conservation projects. The current Director of the Gibbon Conservation Center is Gabriella (Gabi) Skollar, who worked with the founder, Alan Mootnick for several years until his passing. The GCC was founded by Alan Mootnick (January 23, 1951–November 4, 2011), a native of Encino, California who became a leading authority on gibbons despite having no formal training in the biological sciences. Mootnick acquired his first gibbon (a former pet named Spanky) in 1976, and in 1980 he used money from his home repair and painting business to buy the 10 acre site where the Center now operates.Joshuah Bearman, \\"Best Ape Hoots and Howls: Gibbon Conservation Center\\", LA Weekly, October 1, 2008.T.

He played at representative level for Yorkshire, and at club level for Wakefield Trinity (Heritage No. 735 (two spells), Bramley and Batley (player-coach), as a , or , i.e. number 1, 2 or 5, or, 3 or 4, and coached at club level for Batley and Dewsbury. Background Terry Crook was born in Outwood, Wakefield, West Riding of Yorkshire, Playing careerCounty honours (Yorkshire)= Terry Crook represented Yorkshire in 1977. Yorkshire played Lancashire at Castleford on 1 March 1977 when TC received his 'county call up' in the centres. Yorkshire won 18–13 with the 'White Rose' team being: Keith Mumby, Peter Muscroft, Terry Crook, Bill Francis, John Atkinson, David Topliss, Gary Stephens, Jimmy Thompson, David Ward, Vince Farrar, Paul Rose, Phil Lowe, Steve Norton. Subs: Nigel Stephenson, Sammy Lloyd. Muscroft, Ward, Lowe and Stephesnon scored the tries with Mumby (1) and Lloyd (2) kicking the goals =Club career (Wakefield Trinity)= Terry Crook signed for Wakefield Trinity in April 1967, from the Wakefield Trinity Juniors, making his début in an away league game at Keighley on 11 October 1967, Wakefield Trinity winning 21–19. He played three games in that first 1967–68 season with his second ever game against the 1967 Australian Kangaroos, TC lining up against Graeme Langlands and Ken Irvine. Although not part of the team he was part of the club that won the 1967 and 1968 RL Championships as well as Wembley 1968. He scored his first try at Keighley in November 1969, but it was not until the 1971–72 season that he started to establish himself as a first team regular, playing eleven games at full back with six on the wing. He also kicked 32 goals in this season, including nine against Workington Town in September 1971, three off the club record, extending this to ten goals in the home game with Batley in December 1971, two off the club record. The following season saw him move into the centres and playing another 30 games. In October 1973 he played against the Australian Kangaroos for a second time, this time lining up against Mick Cronin and Steve Rogers in the centres. Terry Crook played right-, i.e. number 3, and scored a goal in Wakefield Trinity's 2–7 defeat by Leeds in the 1973 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1973–74 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 20 October 1973, and played right-, i.e. number 3, and scored 2-goals in the 13–16 defeat by Hull Kingston Rovers in the 1974 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1974–75 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 26 October 1974. He also reached 'one step from Wembley' after Wakefield Trinity were defeated in the 1975 RL Challenge Cup semi-final, 7–13 by Widnes. Appearances and goals continued over the following years, earning TC a testimonial in 1977, the same year he gained his only Yorkshire appearance. Surprisingly he was transferred to Bramley after his testimonial year. He played his last game of his first stint, at loose forward at Salford in December 1977. He returned to Belle Vue a year later and played in the second row at Castleford in the BBC2 Floodlit Trophy in September 1979. He was now part of the coaching staff and played 13 games in the 1979–80 season. Another game followed in 1980–81 with his final three coming in 1981–82. His last ever Wakefield Trinity game was at Whitehaven in a 9–9 draw on 3 January 1982, playing at full back. His final Wakefield Trinity total read ... Played: 240, Tries: 43, Goals: 325, dg (1pt): 3; Points: 782. His goals see him positioned in 7th on the all-time Wakefield Trinity goal kickers and points see him lie in 8th in Wakefield Trinity's all-time points scoring lists, during his time at Wakefield Trinity he scored forty 3-point tries and, three 4-point tries. =Drop-goals (field-goals)= Terry Crook appears to have scored three drop-goals (or field-goals as they are currently known in Australasia) for Wakefield Trinity, but prior to the 1974–75 season all goals, whether; conversions, penalties, or drop-goals, scored 2-points, consequently prior to this date drop-goals were often not explicitly documented. Coaching career When Terry re-signed for Wakefield Trinity in 1979 he joined the coaching set up with responsibility for the Wakefield Trinity Colts team. He then moved to Batley, in 1982, as player-coach from June 1982 to November 1984, this was followed by a move to Dewsbury, in April 1987 to December 1988, before moving back to Wakefield Trinity in 1991 to take up the role of coach to Wakefield Trinity's fledgling Academy team. He also coached Yorkshire's Academy side in 1991–92. He also spent ten years at Stanley Rangers coaching a junior team from Under-9s to Under-17s, which included players such as Nigel Wright, Richard Goddard, Steve McCurrie, Paul Crook, Darren Rogers, Barry Eaton, Carl Briggs and Michael 'Mickey' Clarkson.

These are caused by the same geological processes as the North Downs. The highest point in Tunworth is around 420 ft (130m) Buildings The little downland church of All Saints, Tunworth, is part of the benefice of Upton Grey. The church is 12th century.Tunworth The church has Norman origins, though the only real sign of this, after the Victorian restoration, is a window on the north (far) side of the church.

In 2012, an oak was planted by the bench to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. There was a school in Tunworth, but this was closed down in the 1950s. Most children now attend either a Basingstoke School or Long Sutton School. Economy The economy of Tunworth is mainly based in the service industry. The land around Tunworth is cultivated, meaning that there is some agriculture. In the past, successful race horses have been bred in Tunworth. A large proportion of Tunworth residents do not work, as Tunworth has a significant number of older people. Land ownership Rose Cottage Most the land around Tunworth is either owned by the Herriard Estate, or by Hackwood Park. This land is rented to various farmers and is also used for pheasant shooting. Some property is owned by the Herriard Estate as well, and is rented out.

North Carolina A biosurvey, or biological survey, is a scientific study of organisms to assess the condition of an ecological resource, such as a water body. Overview Biosurveys are used by government agencies responsible for management of public lands, environmental planning and/or environmental regulation to assess ecological resources, such as rivers, streams, lakes and wetlands. They involve collection and analysis of animal and/or plant samples which serve as bioindicators. The studies may be conducted by professional scientists or volunteer organizations. They are conducted according to published procedures to ensure consistency in data collection and analysis, and to compare findings to established metrics. Biosurveys typically use metrics such as species composition and richness (e.g. number of species, extent of pollution-tolerant species), and ecological factors (number of individuals, proportion of predators, presence of disease). Biosurveys may identify pollution problems that are difficult or expensive to detect using chemical testing procedures. A biosurvey may be used to generate an index of biological integrity (IBI), a scoring system for an ecological resource.

The company originated in 1859 as the Belgian firm Compagnie Belge pour la Construction de Machines et de Matériels de Chemins de Fer, founded by Charles Evrard. The company expanded its share capital in 1881 forming a new firm Société Anonyme Franco-Belge pour la Construction de Machines et de Matériel de Chemins de Fer and constructed a factory in Raismes (Valenciennes) in the Département Nord in France. In 1927, the company split into a Belgian (Société Anglo-Franco-Belge, SAFB) and a French company (Société Franco-Belge). The company’s factories were occupied during World War I, during which period it was used as a sawmill, and during World War II, during which period it manufactured Kriegslokomotives. SAFB merged with the Ateliers Germain in 1964; the company closed in 1968 due to lack of work. The Franco-Belge (based in Raismes) was acquired by Alstom in 1982, as of 2012 the factory Alstom Petite-Forêt, Valenciennes operates as an Alstom subsidiary, specialising in metros, trams, and double deck trains, A test track Centre d'Essais Ferroviaire is located west of the Raismes factory. History Iron cattle wagon, exhibited Paris Exhibition, 1867 In 1859, Charles Evrard acquired Parmentier Freres et Cie. based in La Croyère, (La Louvière, Belgium) and merged it with the Ateliers Charles Evrard (of Brussels, Belgium) to form the Compagnie Belge pour la Construction de Machines et de Matériels de Chemins de Fer (1862),Often referred to as Compagnie Belge pour la Construction de Matériels de Chemins de Fer with a capital of 1 million francs.Sources: * * Charles Evrard was the company’s director. At the Exposition Universelle (1867) in Paris, the company exhibited a locomotive, passenger coaches, an iron goods wagon, and a steam rail crane.Sources: * * In 1881, the plant in Brussels was closed and the factory’s equipment was transferred, reducing pollution and other inconveniences caused to the populace of Brussels. A new company, the Société Anonyme Franco-Belge pour la Construction de Machines et de Matériel de Chemins de Fer, was created in 1881, including all the assets of the 'Compagnie Belge' (representing 60% of the share capital); the company was capitalised to 8 million francs, the Banque Franco-Egyptienne invested in the new enterprise. In 1882 a new factory was established in Raismes in the north of France, allowing the company to circumvent protectionism in the French market; initially the factory at Raismes in France assembled machines using components manufactured across the border in Belgium. All types of railway rolling stock were built by the company.Alain Dewier, \\"Le site Germain-Anglo à La Louvière..\\", De la création à 1914; p.3 Charles Evrard died in 1896. In 1911, the company was renamed Société Franco Belge de Matérial de Chemins de Fer. The company manufactured a wide variety of rolling stock (locomotives, carriages, specialised freight wagons) for clients, including the Belgian railways, private French railways, as well as exporting to Spain, Portugal, and other European countries; China, Turkey, and Indochina; as well as to African and South American countries. Up to 1914, the company board was dominated by Belgians; after 1914, the company became majority owned by French interests, mainly from Paris. At this time the company had a capacity of around 50 locomotives and over 1,500 carriages and wagons per year; during German occupation during World War I, the plant in Raismes was ordered to carry out repair work, but this was resisted by the plant management - the factory was used under occupation as a sawmill. Post World War I, the French and Belgian activities were separated into independent companies in 1927 with the Croyere site forming the company \\"Société Anglo- Franco-Belge\\" (SAFB or AFB), which received English investment and specialised in equipment for metal and wooden fabrications for transportation equipment.Alain Dewier, \\"Le site Germain-Anglo à La Louvière..\\", De 1914 à 1945 The French operations of the company remained as \\"Franco-Belge\\". =Société Anglo-Franco-Belge (1927-64)= 'Kriegslok' thumb In 1939, SAFB two acquired two metal working factories were absorbed, in Seneffe and Godarville (Chapelle-lez-Herlaimont), both in Hainaut, Belgium. During occupation, the company manufactured over 100 locomotives for the Deutsche Reichsbahn, as well as carrying out repair work. The company director Gilbert Bostsarron became involved in the French resistance network, and arranged allied attacks on the factory; his network was discovered by axis forces resulting in his being arrested and shot in 1944. Post war the company experienced financial problems, in part due to loss of overseas export customers to American companies. In the 1950s, the company manufactured Electro-Motive Diesel engined diesel locomotives for the railways of Belgium (NMBS/SNCB classes 52, 53, 54, and Luxembourg (CFL class 800 and class 1600). The company also supplied the Israel Railways with its first diesel locomotives in 1952 with an EMD-powered Bo'Bo' design.Sources: * * In 1964, the company merged with the road and rail vehicle manufacturing company S.A. des Ateliers Germain based in Monceau-sur-Sambre to form the Etablissements Germain-Anglo.Alain Dewier, \\"Le site Germain-Anglo à La Louvière..\\", L’après Seconde Guerre mondiale By 1967, the new company was on the verge of collapse with an empty order book—the staff were given notice of the closure which instigated a strike and sit-in at the factory. The situation became one of national interest, with the workers receiving support from trade unions across the country; the prime minister, Paul Vanden Boeynants, visited the factory to seek a resolution. On 1 June 1967, the workers returned to work, after several mitigation measures had been instigated, including short term transfer of staff to other rolling stock manufacturing companies, and large orders given to the metal fabrication plant. Despite this, in February 1968, the company Germain-Anglo ceased operation.Alain Dewier, \\"Le site Germain-Anglo à La Louvière..\\", La fin de la société In 1969, the site of the plant in La Croyère was acquired by developer Société Frabelmar and a hypermarket of , plus leisure facilities, was built, and opened in December 1970.Alain Dewier, \\"Le site Germain-Anglo à La Louvière..\\", Le devenir du site industriel, Cora, La Louvière.

Leni Riefenstahl spent 16 weeks with the Nuba of Kau in 1975. These people, known as the \\"South East Nuba\\", live only 100 miles away from the Mesakin Nuba. Yet, they speak another language, follow different customs, and are very different in character and temperament. Their knife- fights, dances of love and elaborately painted faces and bodies are represented in the book. Critical reception The most well-known critical reaction to Riefenstahl's photography of the Nuba came from the American intellectual, Susan Sontag. Sontag scrutinized the \\"fascist aesthetics\\" of these photo essays in her widely read essay \\"Fascinating Fascism\\". Writing in the New York Review of Books in 1975, she stated: \\"The fascist dramaturgy centers on the orgiastic transactions between mighty forces and their puppets\\". She continued \\"Its choreography alternates between ceaseless motion and a congealed, static, 'virile' posing.\\" Sontag wrote that the collection was the \\"final, necessary step in Riefenstahl's rehabilitation. It is the final rewrite of the past; or, for her partisans, the definitive confirmation that she was always a beauty-freak, rather than a horrid propagandist.\\" References Category:1976 books Category:1997 books Category:German books Category:Sudanese culture Category:Books by Leni Riefenstahl ","title":"The People of Kau"},{"id":"20797955","text":"Richard I was king of England from 1189 to 1199.

The flight crew that flew the aircraft to Denver prior to the incident flight was also on board, though not on duty, and reported having no difficulties with the plane during their previous flight. It suffered an engine failure and subsequent emergency landing in 1995, following which both engines were replaced, but was otherwise undamaged in that incident. Initial speculation suggested that the plane could have suffered a landing gear malfunction that might have resulted in a wheel lockup during the takeoff roll, leading to the runway excursion. NTSB officials said that when the takeoff began, the aircraft's engines appeared to be functioning properly, its tires were inflated, and the brakes did not appear as if they had failed or otherwise malfunctioned, concluding that the landing gear did not cause any problems. On July 17, 2009 it was announced that focus had shifted to a possible large gust of wind or a patch of ice. Captain David Butler stated that: \\"My speculation is that we either got a big, nasty gust of wind or that, with the controls we had in, we hit some ice.\\" He also stated that he stopped pushing on rudder controls because they had stopped working. The winds were reported at about from the northwest with gusts up to nearly just before the airliner began its takeoff roll northward down a north-south runway. The 737 has a crosswind limitation for takeoff of on a dry runway.Lowy, Joan. \\"Pilot recalls 'massive gust of wind' before crash.\\" USA Today. July 17, 2009. Retrieved on December 29, 2009. Contrary to the \\"average\\" wind data reported to the incident pilots, the NTSB investigation found that a sensor at one end of the runway showed a crosswind of , with analysis showing the airplane was hit with a peak gust crosswind of . in addition to being much higher than the data reported to the pilots as they prepared for takeoff, this was also much higher than the airline industry used in pilot training. The NTSB also received a report analyzing 250,327 departures involving 737-500s, and found that only 4 of those departures (less than 0.002%) had experienced a crosswind above , meaning that it was just short of impossible for a commercial pilot to have real-life experience with crosswinds anywhere near the velocity that hit Continental Airlines Flight 1404 that day. The NTSB believes that this is why the pilot believed that his rudder controls were not working, deciding to not push the rudder anymore and to focus instead on other, inadequate remedies to the situation. On July 13, 2010 the NTSB published that the probable cause of this accident was the captain's cessation of right rudder input, which was needed to maintain directional control of the airplane, about 4 seconds before the excursion, when the airplane encountered a strong and gusty crosswind - with a contributing factor of inadequate crosswind training for extreme wind gusts in the airline industry. A further contributing factor was no requirement for the air traffic control system to provide sufficient wind information to the air traffic controllers and pilots. In response to the NTSB report, the Federal Aviation Administration required the airline industry to adjust the crosswind training protocols for pilots, and required ATC to provide multiple sources of wind information, rather than averages, to pilots.

At present, only direct male-line males are allowed to ascend the throne.  Present line of succession  The list below contains all people currently eligible to succeed to the throne. * 15px Emperor Shōwa (1901–1989) ** 15px Emperor Akihito (b. 1933) *** 15px Emperor Naruhito (b. 1960) *** (1) Fumihito, Prince Akishino (b. 1965) **** (2) Prince Hisahito of Akishino (b. 2006) ** (3) Masahito, Prince Hitachi (b. 1935)  History The Imperial House Law of 1889= The Imperial House Law of 1889 was the first Japanese law to regulate the imperial succession. Until October 1947, when it was abolished and replaced with the Imperial Household Law, it defined the succession to the throne under the principle of agnatic primogeniture. In all instances, the succession proceeded from the eldest male heir to the youngest (Ch. I: Article 3). In the majority of cases, the legitimate sons and male heirs of an emperor were favoured over those born to concubines. Illegitimate sons would only be eligible to succeed if no other male heirs existed in the direct line; however, the illegitimate sons of an emperor had precedence over any legitimate brothers of the emperor (Ch. I: Article 4). Those in the line of succession suffering from \\"incurable diseases of mind or body,\\" or when \\"any other weighty cause exists,\\" could be passed over with the advice of the Imperial Family Council, headed by the emperor, and after consulting the Privy Council (Ch. I: Article 9).p. 1235, \\"The Imperial House Law - Chapter 1: Succession to the Imperial Throne,\\" Japan Year Book 1933, Kenkyusha Press, Foreign Association of Japan, Tokyo On 11 February 1907, an amendment was made to the Imperial House Law to reduce the numbers of imperial princes in the shinnōke and ōke, the cadet branches of the imperial family, who were fifth– or sixth-generation descendants of an emperor. The amendment provided for princes to leave the imperial family, either by imperial decree or by imperial sanction. They were then granted a family name and assumed the status of nobles with the peerage titles of marquis or count, thereby becoming subjects (Article I). Alternatively, a prince could be formally adopted into a noble family or succeed to the headship of an imperial family line as a noble (Article II). Under the terms of the amendment, those former princes and their descendants who left the imperial family were excluded from the line of succession and made ineligible to return to the imperial family at any future date (Article VI).pg. 143-144, \\"Leaders and Leadership In Japan,\\" Japan Library, Curzon Press Ltd., Richmond, 1996p. 1239, \\"The Imperial House Law - A Supplement to the Imperial House Law (February 11, 1907),\\" Japan Year Book 1933, Kenkyusha Press, Foreign Association of Japan, Tokyo =Historic line of succession according to the Imperial House Law of 1889 (as of October 1947)= As of October 14, 1947, when the Imperial Household Law abolished the shinnoke (Princely Houses of the Blood) and oke (Princely Houses) cadet branches, the immediate line of succession to the Japanese throne was as follows: * 15px Emperor Taishō (Yoshihito; 1879–1926) ** 15px The Emperor (Hirohito; born 1901) *** (1) The Prince Tsugu (Akihito; b. 1933) *** (2) The Prince Yoshi (Masahito; b. 1935) ** (3) The Prince Chichibu (Yasuhito; b. 1902)Potentially ineligible to succeed by the terms of the 1947 Imperial House Law. ** (4) The Prince Takamatsu (Nobuhito; b. 1905) ** (5) The Prince Mikasa (Takahito; b. 1915) *** (6) Prince Tomohito of Mikasa (b. 1946) Prior to this date, the imperial succession was defined by the Imperial House Law of 1889. As the Taishō Emperor had no brothers, if the main family line had become extinct, the imperial line would have continued through the Fushimi-no-miya shinnoke cadet branch under the terms of the 1889 house law. The Fushimi-no-miya house constitute the nearest direct-male line of imperial descendants; the princes of this branch were descended from Prince Fushimi Kuniie (1802–1872), a 12th- generation descendant of the Northern Court pretender \\"Emperor\\" Sukō, who was himself the grandson of the 93rd emperor Go-Fushimi. Prince Fushimi Kuniie had 17 sons, 3 of which were by the prince's wife Princess Takatsukasa Hiroko (including his future heirs, Prince Sadanori and Prince Fushimi Sadanaru) and the rest were all by various concubines, of whom five begat oke that were extant as of 1947. However, the sons born by Princess Hiroko and their descendants had more prior right to succeed the throne since Hiroko was the only official wife of Prince Kuniie. A 1907 amendment to the Imperial House Law further reduced the number of imperial princes eligible to succeed to the throne. By the amended 1889 house law, the imperial line of succession continued as follows: * Prince Fushimi Kuniie (1802–1872) (Fushimi-no-miya) ** Prince Fushimi Sadanaru (1858–1923) *** Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu (1875–1946) **** Prince Fushimi Hiroyoshi (1897–1938) ***** (7) Prince Fushimi Hiroaki (b. 1932) ** Prince Yamashina Akira (1816–1891) (Yamashina-no-miya) *** Prince Yamashina Kikumaro (1873–1908) **** (8) Prince Yamashina Takehiko (b. 1898)Potentially ineligible to succeed by the terms of the 1889 Imperial House Law. ** Prince Kuni Asahiko (1824–1891) (Kuni-no-miya) *** Prince Kaya Kuninori (1867–1909) (Kaya-no-miya) **** (9) Prince Kaya Tsunenori (b. 1900) ***** (10) Prince Kaya Kuninaga (b. 1922) ***** (11) Prince Kaya Harunori (b. 1926) ***** (12) Prince Kaya Akinori (b. 1929) ***** (13) Prince Kaya Fuminori (b. 1931) ***** (14) Prince Kaya Munenori (b. 1935) ***** (15) Prince Kaya Takenori (b. 1942) *** Prince Kuni Kuniyoshi (1873–1929) **** (16) Prince Kuni Asaakira (b. 1901) ***** (17) Prince Kuni Kuniaki (b. 1929) ***** (18) Prince Kuni Asatake (b. 1940) ***** (19) Prince Kuni Asahiro (b. 1944) *** (20) Prince Nashimoto Morimasa (b. 1874) (Nashimoto-no-miya) *** (21) Prince Asaka Yasuhiko (b. 1887) (Asaka-no-miya) **** (22) Prince Asaka Takehiko (b. 1912) ***** (23) Prince Asaka Tomohiko (b. 1943) *** (24) Prince Higashikuni Naruhiko (b. 1887) (Higashikuni-no-miya) **** (25) Prince Higashikuni Morihiro (b. 1916) ***** (26) Prince Higashikuni Nobuhiko (b. 1945) ** Prince Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa (1847–1895) (Kitashirakawa-no-miya) *** Prince Kitashirakawa Naruhisa (1887–1923) **** Prince Kitashirakawa Nagahisa (1910–1940) ***** (27) Prince Kitashirakawa Michihisa (b. 1937) *** Prince Takeda Tsunehisa (1882–1919) (Takeda-no-miya) **** (28) Prince Takeda Tsuneyoshi (b. 1909) ***** (29) Prince Takeda Tsunetada (b. 1940) ***** (30) Prince Takeda Tsuneharu (b. 1944) ** Prince Kan'in Kotohito (1865–1945) *** (31) Prince Kan'in Haruhito (b. 1902) The Nashimoto collateral branch became extinct in 1951, followed by the Yamashina in 1987, the Kan'in in 1988, and the Kitashirakawa in 2018.https://web.archive.org/web/20181022153405/https://www.jiji.com/jc/article?k=2018102200757&g;=ryl The main Fushimi-no-miya line and the Kaya, Kuni, Higashikuni, and Takeda collateral branches remain extant as of 2020.

For the first eight years of their marriage, the emperor and empress only had girls; as a result, the emperor's younger brother, Prince Chichibu, remained first in line and heir presumptive to the throne until the birth of Crown Prince Akihito in December 1933. As a career military officer and known nationalist with radical leanings, the prince enjoyed close relations with the rightist faction in the military. During the early 1930s, his strong support for the \\"Imperial Way\\" faction in the army was an open secret; he cultivated strong friendships with several junior officers who were later instrumental in leading the revolt during the February 26 Incident. A large number of \\"Imperial Way\\" followers in the military were critical of the emperor for his scientific interests, self- effacing demeanour and presumed pacifism, considering him a \\"mediocre\\" individual easily manipulated by corrupt advisors. With his political leanings, Prince Chichibu antagonized his elder brother, who strongly reprimanded him on several occasions and arranged for his posting to unimportant positions where he could be more closely watched. Apart from Prince Chichibu, the February 26 rebels relied on the tacit support of Princes Asaka and Higashikuni, both senior army generals and imperial princes who were leaders within the \\"Imperial Way\\" faction and had close ties to prominent rightist groups. If the emperor had either died or had been compelled to abdicate, Prince Chichibu would have received strong support from the rightists as the regent for Crown Prince Akihito; however, he was reported to have distanced himself from the \\"Imperial Way\\" officers following the suppression of the February 26 revolt. Still, in 1938 Prince Saionji expressed his worry that Prince Chichibu might someday usurp the throne by violent means. By October 1940, however, Prince Chichibu had become seriously ill with pulmonary tuberculosis, and led a retired life from then on. He was quietly passed over in the line of succession in favour of his brother Prince Takamatsu, who began to undertake more official duties. In an emergency, Prince Takamatsu was intended to assume the regency for his nephew the Crown Prince. In July 1944, though the hopelessness of Japan's war effort became clear after the loss of Saipan, the emperor persisted in defending Prime Minister Tojo and his government and refused to dismiss him. Recognising the emperor's continued obstructiveness would lead to certain defeat, Marquess Kido Koichi, the Lord Privy Seal, quietly consulted with Konoe Fumimaro and the emperor's uncle General Prince Higashikuni Naruhiko about the possibility of forcing the emperor to abdicate in favour of his son the Crown Prince and declaring a regency with Prince Takamatsu as regent. On 8 July, the decision was formally taken, with Prince Takamatsu endorsing it several days later. By this plan, Prince Higashikuni would replace Tojo as prime minister and attempt to negotiate a settlement with the Allies. However, the plan was ultimately dismissed as being too risky. Konoe had informed Kido of rumours that if such a situation were to arise, radicals in the military would stage a coup and take the emperor to Manchuria, still considered a safe location for a government, or replace him on the throne with a more militant imperial prince. In the event, Kido and Konoe used the influence of Prince Takamatsu and his uncles the Princes Asaka and Higashikuni to pressure the emperor to ask for Tojo's resignation; this strategy proved successful, and Tojo resigned his posts on 18 July.  Current succession rules  Article 2 of the Constitution of Japan provides that \\"The Imperial Throne shall be dynastic and succeeded to in accordance with the Imperial Household Law passed by the Diet.\\" The Imperial Household Law of 1947 enacted by the 92nd and last session of the Imperial Diet, retained the exclusion on female dynasts found in the 1889 law. The government of Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida cobbled together the legislation to bring the Imperial House in compliance with the American- written Constitution of Japan that went into effect in May 1947. In an effort to control the size of the imperial family, the law stipulates that only legitimate male descendants in the male line can be dynasts; that naishinnō (imperial princesses) and joō (princesses) lose their status as imperial family-members if they marry outside the imperial family; that shinnō (imperial princes), other than the crown prince, ō (princes), unmarried imperial princesses and princesses, and the widows of imperial princes and princes may, upon their own request or in the event of special circumstances, renounce their membership in the imperial family with approval of the Imperial House Council; and that the Emperor and other members of the imperial family may not adopt children. For an imperial abdication to take place, such as the one that took place in April 2019, it requires special legislation and cannot be explicitly expressed by the monarch himself.  Heisei/Reiwa period succession crisis  Before September 2006, there was a potential succession crisis since no male child had been born into the imperial family since Prince Akishino in 1965. Following the birth of Princess Aiko, there was significant public debate about amending the Imperial House Law to allow female descendants of an emperor and their descendants to succeed to the throne. In January 2005, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi appointed a special panel of judges, university professors, and civil servants to study changes to the Imperial House Law and to make recommendations to the government. On January 24, 2005, the Japanese government announced that it would consider allowing the Crown Prince and Crown Princess to adopt a male child, in order to avoid a possible succession disputes. Adoption from other male-line branches of the Imperial Line is an age-old imperial Japanese tradition for dynastic purposes, prohibited only in modern times after the adoption in 1947 of the American- written Constitution of Japan. The child would presumably be adopted from one of the former imperial branches which lost imperial status after World War II. However, a government-appointed panel of experts submitted a report on October 25, 2005, recommending that the imperial succession law be amended to permit absolute primogeniture. The birth of Prince Hisahito temporarily relieved this discussion of urgency, but it continues to be a subject of active debate. =Proposed changes to succession rules= As above, the liberal wing of the Diet of Japan has proposed absolute primogeniture, which would permit the women of the existing imperial household to serve as empress as well as produce heirs. Prince Tomohito of Mikasa opposed the introduction of absolute primogeniture, as have several Japanese lawmakers.Rally against Japan royals change The conservative wing of the Diet has proposed un-abolishing the Fushimi-no-miya and its branch lines, the Ōke. The Ōke are descended by a direct-male line from Emperor Sukō, who died in 1398. The Ōke families have not been considered aristocrats since 1947 and their descendants are engaged in various private business and media concerns. Notably, the far-right YouTuber Takeda Tsuneyasu, whose YouTube account was terminated in 2018 for hate speech violations, is a male-line heir to the Takeda-no-miya. The English journalist Richard Lloyd Parry has suggested that some members of the Japanese imperial family are opposed to both of the proposed changes and would rather see the natural extinction of their own line. This subject is taboo in Japan and is not openly advocated by any politician. No public opinion polling has been done on this question. A 2005 poll found that 71% of the Japanese public believe the imperial family should have input on the succession problem.JNN世論調査（2005年1月15、16日）  References  Japan Category:Japanese monarchy ro:Linia de succesiune la tronul Japoniei ","title":"Succession to the Japanese throne"},{"id":"20798078","text":"The headquarters in Cotonou Office de Radiodiffusion et Télévision du Bénin (ORTB) is a mainstream terrestrial television channel and radio operator in Benin.

They entertained on radio stations, first at WHO in Des Moines, Iowa, and later at WLS in Chicago and WLW in Cincinnati, before they moved to Los Angeles in 1943, where they were under contract with the MGM film studio. The Williams Brothers appeared in Janie (1944), Kansas City Kitty (1944), Ladies' Man (1947), and Something in the Wind (1947). They also appeared with Bing Crosby on the hit record \\"Swinging on a Star\\" (1944). This led to a nightclub act with entertainer Kay Thompson from 1947 to 1951. The act was staged by MGM choreographer, Robert Alton. They toured night-clubs and cabarets in the United States and internationally with great success and appeared on radio and television establishing a loyal cult following with their jazz-based harmonies and flamboyant performance style. The act broke up in 1951 and the brothers went separate ways, appearing annually on The Andy Williams Christmas Special from 1962 through the 1990s.

Tribute Liza Minnelli has paid tribute to the Kay Thompson and the Williams Brothers act in The South Bank Show (2008). In her 2008 tour, Minnelli devoted much of the performance to recreating the act, using Thompson's trademark music. The success of this tribute led to Minnelli's return to Broadway in December 2008. \\"Liza's at the Palace!\\" opened at New York's legendary Palace Theatre, an affectionate salute to her godmother, Kay Thompson. Supported by a quartet of dynamic singer/dancers standing in for the original Williams Brothers, Liza performed musical hits (with the original vocal arrangements) from the famous act, including such numbers as \\"I Love a Violin,\\" “Clap Yo' Hands,\\" “Jubilee Time\\", and \\"Hello Hello\\".

Cord locks allow mountaineers to fasten clothing and camping equipment quickly in cold conditions when the fingers are encased in heavy gloves. They consist generally of three parts: a barrel, a toggle (plunger), and a spring. Squeezed together, tension is released and the cord lock can move freely up and down the cords. Released, the tension is engaged and the cord lock stays in place. They come in many sizes and shapes to suit to any purpose, including plastic cord lock, mini size cord lock, no spring cord lock, with spring cord lock, with rim cord lock. Cord fasteners are used in many different applications to retain one or more cord segments or drawstrings in a tightened condition and to release such cord segments when desired. For example, cord locks are used in connection with garments that include drawstrings, such as hooded jackets and sweatshirts. Such fasteners are also used on various types of bags such as laundry bags and other storage bags that utilize cords to temporarily close an open end. They are also used in window blinds. They vary in size depending on the particular application, from long. One of many variations of a cord lock was invented by Mark J. Krauss in 1986.

The book was an international bestseller and was followed-up by the 1976 book Die Nuba von Kau.'As pretty as a swastika' The Guardian. 12 May 2007Leni Riefenstahl (obituary) The Times. 10 September 2003 It was the subject of a famous critique by Susan Sontag in claiming that it adhered to a fascist aesthetic. Overview Between 1962 and 1977, Riefenstahl had been photographing people of the Nuba tribes on several visits. She was the first white female photographer who had obtained a special permission by the Sudanese government to do her research in the remote Nuba mountains of Sudan. She studied the Nuba's way of life and recorded it on film and in pictures. Together with George Rodger's earlier photo essay on the Nuba and Latuka tribes, published in 1951 in National Geographic magazine, Riefenstahl's photographic documents are of anthropological, ethnological, and cultural-historical importance in relation to traditional life in the Nuba mountains of these times. Reception In her native Germany, the Art Director's Club of Germany awarded Riefenstahl a gold medal for the best photographic achievement of 1975.Leni Riefenstahl interviewed by Kevin Brownlow Taschen Shortly after its 1974 release in America, the American- Jewish critic Susan Sontag scrutinized the \\"fascist aesthetics\\" of the works in her widely read essay \\"Fascinating Fascism\\". Writing in the New York Review of Books in 1975, she stated: \\"The fascist dramaturgy centers on the orgiastic transactions between mighty forces and their puppets\\". She continued \\"Its choreography alternates between ceaseless motion and a congealed, static, 'virile' posing. Sontag wrote that the collection was the \\"final, necessary step in Riefenstahl's rehabilitation. It is the final rewrite of the past; or, for her partisans, the definitive confirmation that she was always a beauty- freak rather than a horrid propagandist.\\" In December 1974, American writer and photographer Eudora Welty reviewed the book positively for the New York Times, giving a personal account of the aesthetics of Riefenstahl's book:Africa And Paris And Russia The New York Times. 1 December 1974 Academic studies, giving critical appraisals of Riefenstahl's books on the Nuba people, have been published by Alexandra Ludewig of the University of Western Australia and by anthropologist James C. Faris of the University of Connecticut. In his biography on Riefenstahl, the German media critic Rainer Rother gives a detailed account of her repeated visits to the Nuba people, comparing her approach to taking the photographs that seem to have started with a personal fascination of an African world, \\"unspoilt by civilization\\", up to her later carefully planned photo expeditions in order to further her fame as a photographer. Another examination of both Riefenstahl's books and of James C. Faris's criticism is undertaken as a comment on a television film, called The Nuba from the BBC “Worlds Apart” ethnographic series. Here, the author John Ryle describes both the approach of the German photographer and of the anthropologist, trying to do justice to both. Also, he questions the attitude and moral judgements of the admirers of such \\"exotic pictures from Africa\\".

C. Thomson & Co. from 21 January 1967 (#1) to 11 May 1991 (#1,269),Mandy (26pigs.com) with annuals appearing from 1972Mandy: bibliography (26pigs.com) until 2007.Mandy (BritishComics.com) From 1991 until the 24 May 1997 issue,http://comicsuk.co.uk/forum/download/file.php?id=3908&mode;=view it was published as a merged comic with Judy. The two then merged with Bunty before ceasing publication completely in 2001. Mandys content, like many other girls comics from the time, appeared primarily in picture-story format. The majority of the stories were serialized, with typically 2-3 pages of a particular story appearing in each issue, and most stories lasting for 8-12 instalments. Some recurring theme elements of Mandy stories were: * orphans forced to live with cruel or uncaring relatives; * girls enduring blackmail, hardship, or unpopularity to protect a secret (often on behalf of their family); * girls slaving for cruel employers or criminals; * saving animals from cruelty; * cruel factories, shops, boarding schools or workhouses; * heroines adopting masked identities to secretly help people; * spiteful girls causing trouble for an unsuspecting cousin, foster-sister or classmate; * girls becoming unpopular because events keep conspiring to make them appear jealous or selfish; * blundering girls getting into one scrape after another; * girls pretending to be disabled in order to take advantage of people; * girls who were put under a curse or came into possession of apparently supernatural objects which adversely affected their lives, but of which they were unable to rid themselves until they worked out how; * boyfriend-themed stories (by the 1980s). Stories were generally moralistic in tone, with long-suffering heroines finally achieving happiness, while villainous relatives or girls who were liars, cheats and bullies received their comeuppance. Two of the longest- running and most popular picture stories, which also featured in almost every annual, were \\"Angel\\" and \\"Valda\\". \\"Angel\\" centred on Angela Hamilton, a young, wealthy Victorian girl who discovers she has only a year to live and decides to devote her remaining time to caring for orphaned and unwanted children in the slums of the East End of London. \\"Valda\\" stories are set in many different times and places and follow the adventures of a girl with extraordinary abilities and apparently indefinite lifespan. Valda, who draws her physical strength from energy or light passing through a mysterious 'Crystal of Life' that she carries, travels the world coming to the aid of the oppressed and those threatened by dark or supernatural forces. Mandy also ran text stories, usually serialized in the same manner as the picture-stories, of which the most popular was \\"The Guardian Tree\\". This followed the trials and tribulations of the Shaw family, when the five children are orphaned in Victorian times. The children, under the leadership of the eldest sister, Rose, escape the dreaded poorhouse by living on the moors in a cave beneath the roots of a vast tree they christen the \\"Guardian Tree\\", which appears to have mysterious and benevolent powers.

Peloroplites is based on CEUM 26331, a partial skull, with numerous postcranial bones recovered from the same quarry. These specimens were designated paratypes. The type species is P. cedrimontanus, in reference to the Cedar Mountain Formation. The skull was about long, and wide between the eyes. It lacked beak teeth, and had only modest horn-like projections. The top of the skull was only slightly domed, and the only preserved upper cheek tooth was large and similar to teeth assigned to Priconodon, another large nodosaurid from about the same time. The lower jaws are represented by their rear halves, and were heavily built. Of the postcranial skeleton, bones from all areas of the body are represented, except the hind foot. Six fused vertebrae supported the hip, as in Silvisaurus. The ilia, the largest bones of the hip, appear to have been flared out unusually, at 55° compared to the ~30° or ~40° degrees of other nodosaurids, but this could be a preservational accident. Unlike most other nodosaurids, the ulna was long and straight, and the major ankle bone (the astragalus) was not fused to the shin. Paleobiology and paleoecology Peloroplites was found in mudstone, in a quarry that also produced fossils of a turtle, a pterosaur, four individuals of a new brachiosaurid sauropod, the basal ankylosaurid Cedarpelta, and an iguanodont ornithopod. Ankylosaurians attained large sizes at the Aptian-Albian boundary; both Peloroplites and Cedarpelta are comparable in size to Sauropelta, a nodosaurid from about the same time but known from the Cloverly Formation of Wyoming and Montana. In fact, isolated bones from older levels of the Cedar Mountain Formation, assigned to Sauropelta, may actually pertain to Peloroplites. Ankylosaurians are usually interpreted as low-browsing quadrupedal herbivores. The large teeth and robust jaws of Peloroplites suggest that it was consuming tougher forage than other ankylosaurians.

The large two- story house was built in 1812, and is one of the finest Federal period houses in northern York County. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Blazo–Leavitt House is a large two-story mansion built in Parsonsfield, Maine, in 1812 by William Blazo, uncle to prominent Parsonsfield lawyer Robert Tibbetts Blazo. Oral tradition holds that Robert T. Blazo, as a young man of fifteen in 1812, and later aged twenty in 1817, had helped with the construction of his uncle's house. This story seems credible because Robert had been bound out to his uncle William when Robert's father (William's brother) Daniel Blazo fell from a beam at a barn raising in 1802 and broke his neck. Later, ownership of the house passed to the nephew, Robert T. Blazo. The house next was passed on to Robert Blazo's two daughters, Susan Blazo Leavitt and Emily Blazo Browne. Emily's daughter Maude Browne left no descendants, and the house eventually passed into the hands of Susan Blazo Leavitt's son, Robert Greenleaf Leavitt, his wife Ida Ruggli Leavitt, and his three children Russell Greenleaf Leavitt, Robert Keith Leavitt, and Constance Ruggli Leavitt Hanson. Thus it is called the Blazo–Leavitt house. Designed by architect Thomas Eaton, according to both family tradition and affirmed by a Maine preservationist, the home is on the National Register of Historic Places. The Blazo–Leavitt house has five large brick chimneys and ten fireplaces. The home also boasts elaborately carved and pillared entrances with leaded glass fans and sidelights, panelled doors, and small-paned windows. A complete description of the interior of the house is described in a long narrative poem entitled \\"Flora Visits Parsonsfield\\" by Mary Freeman, a resident of the house for thirty years and great, great granddaughter of Robert and Mary Blazo. The main ell of the home was built in 1812, the main part of house being constructed five years later in 1817. William Blazo was son of Amos Blazo, who in turn was son of William Blazo of Bordeaux, France, who emigrated to America sometimes before 1727, settling first in Greenland, New Hampshire, and later in Epsom. Amos Blazo is recorded in the History of Parsonsfield as having been North Parsonsfield's first settler, clearing the fields at \\"Blazo's Corner\\" in March 1778. Amos Blazo had five sons, four of whom settled on nearby farms. It was Amos's son William who built the Blazo House, later selling it to his nephew, and Amos's grandson, Robert Tibbetts Blazo. The house in 2015 Robert Tibbetts Blazo had begun his career as a schoolmaster. One of his pupils was fifteen-year-old Mary Freeman of Sandwich, New Hampshire, who would become his bride eight years later. Before the marriage Robert Blazo practiced law for a time in Moultonborough, New Hampshire, but eventually the couple settled in Parsonsfield where Blazo practiced law, and was for many decades Justice of the Peace and Post Master. The couple had four children: Susan, Daniel, Charles and Emily. Descendants of Daniel still reside in the Daniel Blazo house directly across from the Blazo–Leavitt house at Blazo's Corner. All four Blazo children attended Parsonsfield Seminary, to which their father had conveyed the land and helped establish. Here Susan Blazo met John Greenfield Leavitt, a fellow student from Buckfield, Maine, who had come to Parsonfield to prepare for Waterville College (today's Colby College). The couple married, and moved into the Blazo house with her parents; they had one child, Robert Greenleaf Leavitt. Emily Blazo married Howard Hiram Browne, and they too took up residence in the house; they had one child, Maude Browne, who later became a portrait artist. Because Maude Browne was unable to have children, eventually ownership of the house came to the Leavitts and to their son Robert Greenleaf Leavitt, a well- known Harvard-educated botanist and educator. After Robert G. Leavitt's death in 1942, Robert's wife Ida and their children, and grandchildren, and great grandchildren, continued living in it every summer. Robert Greenleaf Leavitt's daughter, Constance Leavitt Hanson, with great regret, sold the house in 1973. The Blazo and Leavitt family have been associated with Parsonsfield Seminary, which is located directly across the road from the house. Robert Tibbetts Blazo, second owner of the Blazo-Leavitt House, conveyed land on which Seminary was built and helped found the Seminary. The Blazo–Leavitt house faces south, and its western side faces Green Mountain, an isolated mountain in Effingham, New Hampshire and part of the foothills of the White Mountains. Nearby is the Leavitt Plantation Forest (connected with another branch of the Leavitt family), an tract that is the largest contiguous block of forest land south of Sebago Lake. Leavitt Plantation Forest covers 20 percent of Parsonsfield's land. With the support of The Nature Conservancy, the State of Maine has purchased a permanent conservation easement to ensure sustainable forest practices and public pedestrian access for recreation. The easement also prohibits development activity on the property. The land remains as working commercial forest.

In a flashback, a five-year-old April is seen living with Janet and Daniel Johnson. The Johnsons' relationship was an abusive one, that lead to Janet's suicide. Meanwhile, Marion goes to April's school, where she talks to April's friends, and realizes that they were lied to. April leaves Pat's home, and travels alone to visit Janet's grave. Marion continues to search, and meets Elliot in a shopping center. April visits the now abandoned Sunnyholme Children's Home, where she lived when she was younger. In a flashback, an eight-year-old April lives at the Sunnyholme and is cared for by a woman, Mo. April befriends an older girl, Gina, and is introduced to Pearl, a girl her own age. Pearl behaves in front of Mo, but actually bullies April when Mo is not around. Gina wakes April up one night to join in on a burglary, and, later, Pearl attacks April, holding her head under water. Pearl also tears up April's beloved paper dolls. April confronts Pearl, and pushes her down a flight of stairs. She is reprimanded by Mo. A voice-over from 14-year-old April says Gina was then \\"moved on\\", and, eventually, April is also moved on. The flashback jumps forward to April's time at Fairdale Residential School. She befriends Poppy, who has Asperger syndrome. In the present, Marion buys a mobile phone for April. Back at Fairdale, April is being taught by Miss Marion Bean. A Homework project on family trees leads to a fight. At night, April tries to escape the school to find Gina, but is caught by Marion, who sends her back. Marion reads April's records, and when she learns about her history, she apologizes for the family tree incident. Banned from going out on a Saturday with her peers, April is instead taken to the stately home by Marion. A present-day Marion goes alone to her house, to find that there are no messages on the phone. The younger Marion introduces April to Elliot as they continue to visit the home. The present-day Marion goes to April's room, and looks in April's box, which contains mementos from different times in her life. The younger April and Marion walk through the home's garden, and Marion tells April she is leaving Fairdale. April becomes angry, thinking that Marion, like others before her, is now going to leave her life. Marion invites April to move in with her, and she accepts. When shown around her new bedroom, April's first concern is to have somewhere to put her box. The present April considers returning to Marion, but realises there is another place she wants to visit. It occurs to Marion where April will be going, and she drives away from her house. April goes to the alley where she was found as a baby, and stands among the trash bins. Marion opens April's cell phone and calls Reno's, the pizza parlour. April then notices a phone number on the side of a dustbin. Marion asks for directions to the pizza parlour, while April dials the number she found. It is not her mother who answers, as she hoped, but Frankie, the pizza boy who found her. She meets Frankie in the pizza parlour, and Marion arrives. April explains who Frankie is, and Marion gives April her new phone. The three sit down together. A voice-over from April says that, though she will probably never know her birth mother, she has a mother in Marion, and this is just the beginning.

The film's screenplay was based on Jacqueline Wilson's 2001 novel Dustbin Baby, and was written by Helen Blakeman, who had previously worked on Pleasureland. Dustbin Baby was co-commissioned by CBBC and BBC One, and was produced by Kindle Entertainment, a production company specialising in children's television. According to The Guardian, the film was billed as \\"a key part of BBC1's Christmas family line-up\\". Blakeman said that when she had read the novel, she \\"knew it was something [she] had to write\\". The film's executive producers were Anne Brogan and Melanie Stokes for Kindle, with Sue Nott as executive producer for CBBC. The producer was Julia Ouston. Director Juliet May, at the time of filming, had 14-year-old twins, and so found \\"the fact that the lead, April, is 14 years old ... very interesting\\" as she felt she could \\"kind of understand 14-year-old children\\".May, Juliet. Behind the Bin. Event occurs at approximately 2:40. Though the \\"gritty realism\\" of Wilson's novels was different from Dakota Blue Richards's first role as Lyra Belacqua in The Golden Compass, she was happy to take on the character of April. She said she \\"can really relate to the characters\\" in Wilson's novels, but found that April was \\"a really different person\\" to her. Wilson, who had previously seen Richards in The Golden Compass, was \\"over the moon to hear she was going to be in Dustbin Baby.Wilson, Jacqueline. Behind the Bin. Event occurs at approximately 7:37. Richards was to play the 14-year-old April, but other actresses were required to play younger versions of the character. Lucy Hutchinson, who was five at the time of filming, played the youngest April. Director Juliet May described her as \\"one of the most remarkable five year olds I have ever met\\", saying that \\"it's like she's not acting at all\\".May, Juliet. Behind the Bin. Event occurs at approximately 5:00. Alex Hewett was selected to play the \\"middle April\\". May described her as having \\"utter truth in her acting\\".May, Juliet. Behind the Bin. Event occurs at approximately 5:57. Though ten years old, Hewett plays April at eight.Hewitt, Alexandra. Behind the Bin. Event occurs at approximately 6:45. Juliet Stevenson said she was attracted to the part of Marion as \\"it's very boring playing versions of yourself\\", and because she did at the time have a 14-year-old daughter. David Haig filmed Dustbin Baby, along with three other television appearances that summer, to earn money to help support his family while he appeared in the play Loot. He described his role as a \\"snug cameo with a purpose\\". Dustbin Baby was filmed over summer 2008 in London and the surrounding areas, with scenes at Hatfield House and in Barnet. Before the completion of the filming, Wilson was quoted as saying she was \\"thrilled at the prospect of Dustbin Baby being brought to life by such a talented cast and production team. I am looking forward to seeing the end result immensely.\\" The BBC purposefully searched for an actress with Asperger syndrome to play the part of Poppy. Lizzy Clark auditioned for the part after her mother saw an advert on an autism website. Clark was selected to play Poppy, and the role in Dustbin Baby was her first experience of professional acting. Clark was the first actress with Asperger syndrome to portray a fictional character with the condition. Clark, who has since campaigned with her mother against characters with conditions such as Asperger syndrome being played by actors without the condition, said \\"My Asperger's made some things on the film set difficult at first, like dealing with the sudden noise of the storyboard, but I was soon so focused on acting that I didn't notice anything else.\\"  Themes  The \\"present\\" April on her journey of self-discovery. Blakeman said that she read the book in a single sitting, before \\"crying her eyes out\\". The film includes the themes of bullying, youth crime, domestic violence, unwanted pregnancy, and teenage angst. For Blakeman, April's \\"heartbreaking journey in searching for her real mum is also about being brave enough to let love in.\\" Tom Sutcliffe, writing for The Independent, spoke of the limits of taboo themes in family dramas, and said the film's \\"account of a life lived in care couldn't have had swearing, or casual drug use, and when a shadow fell over a child's bed at night, it wasn't the care-home manager coming to exercise some horrible , as it might have been in an adult drama\\". The film also addressed the theme of Asperger syndrome through the character of Poppy. The BBC claimed that Clark, who has the condition herself, was able to offer \\"a unique take\\" on the role. Steveson summarised the themes of the film, saying that \\"At the centre of the story, Marion finds out that she loves this girl. And that is an amazing liberation when you discover someone more important to you than you are. That is what is incredible about becoming a parent – you care about your child more than you care about yourself.\\" On Behind the Bin, a making-of documentary about Dustbin Baby, Wilson said that \\"lots and lots of people will identify with\\" the central theme of adoption, as at fourteen \\"you start to look at your mum and dad and think 'I'm nothing like them', and everyone seems to have fantasies about that they were adopted or something, and so I think that it's a typical teenage thing that you question who you are\\".Wilson, Jacqueline. Behind the Bin. Event occurs at approximately 3:33. Richards says that she likes the idea that April \\"went on a journey to try and find herself\\" as \\"a lot of people [her age] try and do that because a lot of people get to the point where they're not really sure who they are any more\\".Richards, Dakota Blue. Behind the Bin. Event occurs at approximately 4:40. Richards also discusses the motif of April's paper dolls, saying that April can relate to them as in different places, she is \\"still the same person\\", but that she is \\"coloured in differently by different people and different surroundings\\".Richards, Dakota Blue. Behind the Bin. Event occurs at approximately 4:00. Alexandra Hewett, who played the Young April, described the dolls as April's \\"only real friends\\".Hewitt, Alexandra. Behind the Bin. Event occurs at approximately 4:48. Stevenson described the character of Marion as \\"cranky, stubborn and lonely\\", saying that living alone has made her \\"become quite idiotic and eccentric\\". When the character of April arrives, Stevenson explains that \\"Marion has to go from nought to 80 in terms of parenting. There are lots of reasons she wouldn't get it right\\" which leads on to the guilt and anxiety that Marion suffers when April runs away. Stevenson compared her own difficulties of parenting to Marion's, saying \\"it is easier for me than someone like Marion because I have had 14 years experience\\". Richards spoke of the character of April, saying that \\"the residential schools and children's homes were completely different from my life. [April] doesn't feel connected to anybody and she struggles to know who she is\\".  Reception  Wilson, after seeing an early screening of Dustbin Baby, said that it was the best film adaptation of any of her works. Haig said that the film was his favourite of his summer projects, saying \\"it was a terrific story and very touchingly done. I think Juliet Stevenson was very funny and moving in it\\". During its initial run on BBC One, Dustbin Baby was watched by 2.3 million viewers, giving it a 15.4% share of the audience. Critics responded positively to the film. In an article in The Times David Chater awarded the programme the TV choice of the day, describing it as \\"tremendous\\", and \\"the wonderful surprise of Christmas\\". The film was described in The Telegraph as a \\"rare treat\\", as it is \\"something that teenagers and parents can watch together\\". This view was shared by producer Anne Brogan, who said that the film was something \\"that parents and children will enjoy watching while giving them much to talk about\\". Tom Sutcliffe, writing for The Independent, said Stevenson was \\"good as a woman who was far more comfortable in the past than the present\\", and that \\"her performance was more than matched by that of Dakota Blue Richards as April, mostly banked-down and wary but prone to sudden wild flashes of anger\\". He criticised some of the \\"implausibilities\\", saying that the plot was, at times, \\"a lot kinder than the world might have been\\", but said that \\"it still made you well up with its final reconciliation\\" with emotion that had been \\"honestly earned\\". Euan Ferguson, in an article in The Guardian, said that the film \\"hooked and haunted\\", and added that Stevenson played Marion like \\"a kind of updated\\" Jean Brodie.  Accolades  In 2009, Dustbin Baby was one of four works of children's television shortlisted for the International Emmy Award in the children and young people category at the 37th International Emmy Awards. The other nominations were Lharn Poo Koo E-Joo (produced by Workpoint Entertainment), The Little Emperor's Christmas (produced by Rede Globo), and Mille (produced by the Danish Broadcasting Corporation). The film was one of nine nominations for the UK, which had more than any other nation. The film won the award, making it one of six International Emmys for the UK, and one of three for the BBC, in 2009. Dustbin Baby was also shortlisted for the British Academy Children's Awards in the drama category, along with The Sarah Jane Adventures (also by the BBC), S4C's Rhestr Nadolig Wil, and the online show following boyband US5. The ceremony was held on 29 November at The London Hilton on Park Lane and hosted by Dick and Dom. Dustbin Baby lost out to Rhestr Nadolig Wil. Blakeman was shortlisted for the British Academy Children's Award for best writer, thanks to her screenplay for Dustbin Baby, and won. The film was also entered into the BAFTA Kids' Vote in the television category. Children aged between seven and fourteen were able to vote for their favourite television show from a choice also featuring Blue Peter, Dani's House, Newsround, Prank Patrol, The Sarah Jane Adventures, Hannah Montana, Phineas & Ferb, iCarly, and SpongeBob SquarePants. The Kids' Vote was won by Hannah Montana. In February 2010, Dustbin Baby was awarded the 2010 KidScreen Award for best one-off, special, or TV movie aimed at a family audience. The film also won the Creative Talent award for best acting. These were two of five prizes won by CBBC at the inaugural KidScreen Awards, and Joe Godwin, the BBC Children's director, said \\"I'm truly delighted that CBBC programmes are being recognised globally for being original and inspiring to children everywhere ... It's especially satisfying to win awards for really distinctive and hard-hitting factual and drama, which has always been, and always will be, a unique and central part of what BBC Children's does.\\"  Home media release  Dustbin Baby was released on DVD in January 2009 by ITV DVD. It was rated PG by the British Board of Film Classification, due to \\"mild threat, violence and one sex reference\\",Dustbin Baby DVD slipcase. ITV DVD. and was marketed with the tagline \\"April is about to lift the lid on her past\\". The DVD included a 24-minute making-of feature, \\"Behind the Bin: The Making of Dustbin Baby\\", containing interviews with Jacqueline Wilson and production staff and cast.Behind the Bin.

He was later awarded the degree of Doctor of Civil Laws by Oxford in 1864. Career In 1824, Beresford was ordained deacon and in 1825 priest, and was quickly appointed Rector of Kildallon, County Cavan, a parish in his father's diocese of Kilmore. Three years later, he was preferred to the vicarages of Drung and Larah in the same diocese, benefices which he held until 1839 when he became archdeacon of Ardagh when Ardagh was united with Kilmore. His father was succeeded by Bishop Leslie, but on Leslie's death in 1854 Beresford followed in his father's footsteps as bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh and was consecrated in Armagh Cathedral on 24 September 1854. In 1862, following the death of his cousin Lord John George Beresford, Beresford was translated to succeed him as Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of All Ireland, holding also the see of Clogher. As Archbishop, Beresford was appointed to the Privy Council of Ireland and also sometimes acted as a lord justice for the government of Ireland in the absence of the Viceroy. In the Church, Beresford gained the reputation of being a statesmanlike presence during the storms which were caused by William Ewart Gladstone's measures to bring about disestablishment of the Church of Ireland, playing a large part in the negotiations this called for, and then afterwards had the hard task of reconstituting the church.

Variety called it a \\"half-klutzy, half- engaging eccentric comedy...bolstered by good turns from leads Rachel Griffiths and Jonathan Pryce\\" but \\"falling prey to a general disorganization in tone and structure.\\" The Guardian called it \\"a broad comedy with a very derivative Monty-ish plot, but likeable and good-natured.\\" The New York Times called the film \\"alternately mushy and farcical\\" with an \\"undertone of satire\\" that keeps the film from \\"choking on its own cuteness\\"; it \\"churns up a few genuinely funny bits\\" including a climax \\"that is almost worth waiting for.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:English-language films Category:British musical comedy films Category:British films Category:Welsh- language films Category:2000s musical comedy films Category:British coming-of- age comedy films Category:2001 films Category:Films shot in Wales Category:Films set in Wales Category:Films produced by Graham Broadbent Category:2001 comedy films Category:2000s coming-of-age comedy films ","title":"Very Annie Mary"},{"id":"20798854","text":"Handles is a realistic children's novel by Jan Mark, first published in 1983 by Kestrel Books of Harmondsworth, London, with illustrations by David Parkins. Set in the Norfolk countryside, it features a city girl on holiday, who loves motorcycles. Nicholas Tucker calls it \\"a happy, optimistic work\\"; Erica escapes \\"mean-minded relatives\\" for the \\"anarchic motorbike-repair outfit in a nearby town\\". Mark and Handles won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association, recognising the year's best children's book by a British subject. Thus she became the third writer with two such honors (of seven through 2012), having won the 1976 Medal for her debut novel Thunder and Lightnings. Also set in the Norfolk countryside, it features two boys who love aeroplanes. Atheneum Books published the first U.S. edition in 1985, retaining the Parkins illustrations. Title \\"Handles\\" in this book are names with a special significance, a symbol of self-discovery or growing into oneself. The title also plays on the \\"handles\\" by which a motorcycle is steered, a symbol of control. Plot introduction Erica Timperley, a city girl who loves motorcycles, is bored with her holiday in Norfolk where her Uncle and Aunt grow acres of vegetables. Then she sees a cat with false teeth and discovers Mercury Motor Cycles, an unusual motorcycle repair shop down an alley. There she meets the enigmatic young man \\"Elsie\\" Wainwright, who allows her the honour of helping out in the workshop. Apart from beginning to learn the trade, Erica learns a whole new arcane vocabulary and meets an array of curious characters including Bunny and Bill Birdcycle. Eventually she gets a \\"handle\\" of her own, and by the end of the summer is determined to become a mechanic. Literary significance and reception The realism of Handles has been particularly commended. From Reading for Enjoyment: 12–15: \\"This is a richly comic tale ... Jan Mark knows how young people think and talk.\\"Fiona Waters, Reading for Enjoyment: 12–15, Baker Books, 1987, p. 17. From the New York Times review: \\"Jan Mark stretches the range of children's books ... she provides for young people the combination of fine prose and strong realism generally reserved for adults.\\"New York Times review, July 28 1985. In Tucker's obituary view more than twenty years later, Handles was a \\"happy, optimistic work\\" in which the heroine found in the motorbike-repair shop \\"the company and interests she had always longed for\\". This was in marked contrast to three of Mark's earlier works, young adult science-fiction novels set in \\"a hopeless future\\", which some critics regarded as \\"too gloomy for a young audience\\".

Currently Director of an influential Middle East human rights organisation, he continues to advocate open democracy and works on both a regional and international level to this end, focusing on the situation in Syria, Iran and Saudi Arabia in particular. The early years and South America Born in Lebanon's picturesque Beka'a Valley city of Zahlé, (; also transliterated Zahlah or Zahleh) Mr Tarif and his family come from the small mountain town of al-Karaoun on the banks of Lake Litani in the same region. Known in Lebanon for their courage when faced with the occupation of their town (notably, the family was the first to have their home blown up by the invading army), their reputation for independent thinking in a country constitutionally constructed on sectarian interests, is well-established. \\"When, at 12 years old, my friend Jude was run over by a military tank, I was splattered by his flesh. I can still taste the burning skin whenever I remember it. It was something that changed my life, made me aware of the importance of being human, being a person,\\" Tarif recalls. Having grown up with the sounds, smells and tragedy of continuous conflict all his life, at the age of 13, Wissam Tarif was sent by his family to South America (Paraguay and Argentina), where he joined elder brothers who had been sent ahead of him. From a very early age, though, he assumed and adopted a strong sense of responsibility towards himself and others. Back in Beirut and then Syria Immersing himself in civil society institutions in Beirut, Mr Tarif started by working for Greenpeace where he began to get a feel for the region's concerns at grass roots level, making his initial appearance on the opinion and analysis pages of well-known and respected Middle East newspapers and magazines, such as An-Nahar. Coming, as he did, to the attention of numerous politicians and leading intellectuals in Lebanon (as was the case with the redoubtable Samir Kassir, with whom a warm friendship grew), Mr Tarif soon became an integral part of intellectual life in Beirut. Anxious, however, to continue contributing to democracy and human rights values in the region, he eventually moved to Damascus, Syria, where he founded a cultural centre. Parallel to this, Mr Tarif became a prime mover of the Opposition forces in Syria, working closely with well-known artist,http://www.slide.com/r/tBGT- uc35T8aBjRmn5K-HqgaDzTPjnHg?previous_view=mscd_embedded_url&view;=original political dissident, prisoner of conscience and human rights leader Kamal Labwani,http://www.fdpoc.com/search?updated- max=2018-11-08T23%3A37%3A00%2B02%3A00&max- results;=9http://www.europeandemocracy.org/KamalLabwaniApoliticalprisonerofBasharalA/tabid/636/Default.aspx (sent to jail in Syria on a 15-year term for his advocacy of democracy) to found the Liberal Democratic Union. Tarif worked to support and promote the values of a movement known as the Damascus Spring, which blossomed following the coming to power of the new President of Syria, Bashaar al-Assad. Sadly, the hope of those early days was soon smashed with the tightening of the Syrian regime's grip on power which led to the imprisonment of the majority of voices claiming freedom and democracy. Working for democracy Since then, Wissam Tarif has led a continuous campaign for the democratisation of Syria, Lebanon and the Middle East. Appreciated for his in-depth political and strategic published analyses, he has made a reputation not only among the diplomatic and political communities in Lebanon and Syria, but amongst intellectuals, communicators and thinkers. Interrogated 17 times by the Syrian security police during his time in Syria, there have been various attempts on his life. Undeterred, he continues to campaign as Director of the Middle East human rights organisation, the Foundation for the Defense of Prisoners of Conscience (FDPOC). The Foundation for the Defense of Prisoners of Conscience (FDPOC) and INSAN FDPOC (now superseded by the Europe-based NGO INSAN INSAN)worked in Syria, Iran and Saudi Arabia in particular. It received daily monitoring reports from grass roots activists within its countries of focus, in order to ensure that the rest of the world heard about the violations of human rights the authorities preferred to keep silent. The organisation and its Board of Trustees were also active at an international level. Wissam Tarif, however, argued for a wider, more global vision for the Organisation, as a result of which FDPOC took a strategic decision in 2009: to maintain its activists and workers in situ in the Middle East but to shift its centre of operations to the European Union in order to not only increase its operational effectiveness, but to ensure a framework of freedom which would better enable it to ensure human rights in the region were better and more immediately projected. The new organisation, under the name of 'INSAN' (www.insanintl.com) is a fully registered NGO with its headquarters in Spain. INSAN thus builds on the previous work done by FDPOC but, at the same time, expands upon it. INSAN's work, while focussing on human rights, also covers the broader fields of democracy and development issues across not only the Middle East but also throughout North Africa (MENA). It was in this wider context (and to facilitate its activist and campaigning work), that the Organisation's offices were transferred to Spain, which is strategically situated to service the logistic and campaigning needs of this already growing but well-established Organisation. This is especially the case with an eye to INSAN's centre of operations in the MENA region and to the closeness of influential EU institutions and politicians in Brussels. Wissam Tarif is currently Executive Director of INSAN.

Barba is known for using the medium of film and its materiality to create cinematic film installations, sculptures and publications, which inquire into the ambiguous nature of reality, memory, landscape and their role in their mutual constitution and representation. Her engagement with analogue film has been linked to the work of other contemporary practitioners such as Matthew Buckingham, Tacita Dean, Luke Fowler, and Ben Rivers.Film: Tacita Dean (The Unilever series) (London: Tate Publishing, 2011) Barba currently lives and works in Berlin, Germany.\\"Rosa Barba Biography\\", Vistamare Gallery, Retrieved 30 October 2018. Early life and education Rosa Barba was born in 1972 in the town of Agrigento, on the Italian island of Sicily. She began at a young age to work with film. She very soon began experimenting with moving images using super 8 film. From 1993 to 1995 she studied Theater and Film Studies in Erlangen, Germany. She continued her studies in film between 1995 and 2000 at the Academy of Media Arts Cologne in Cologne, Germany..Barba made her first 16mm film while at the Academy, titled Panzano (2000), in which three characters struggle to assign parts among themselves.Alemani, Cecilia: Rosa Barba interview by Cecilia Alemani. klat, no. 2 (Spring 2010): 18–35 In 2018, Barba acquired her PhD at the Malmö Art Academy at Lund University, under the supervision of Sarat Maharaj, professor for Visual Arts and Knowledge Systems. Barba has actively continued to study film through a number of fine arts institutions and residencies, including the two-year residency program at Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten in Amsterdam (2003-2004), Production-in-Residence program, Baltic Arts Center Visby (2006), Villa Aurora, Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, USA (2006), IASPIS Stockholm (2007-2008) and the Artists-in-Residence-Programm of Chinati Foundation, Marfa, Texas (2013). Official Website Later residencies include a stay at the Curtis R. Priem Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center EMPAC at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy (NY) in 2014-15 and a residency at Headlands Center for the Arts in San Francisco (CA) in the spring of 2017. At EMPAC, Barba was commissioned a new work production in collaboration with Rensselaer’s Hirsch Observatory, which resulted in two site-specific installations spanning different media formats, The Color out of Space and White Museum. The various professional and educational experiences have brought Barba to teaching and she currently holds a Professorship in Fine Arts at the University of the Arts, Bremen. Work She exhibits in galleries and museums internationally.Rosa BarbaMade in Germany 2, 08 Feb 2012 In 2018, solo shows of her work will be presented, amongst others, at Tabakalera, International Centre for Contemporary Culture, San Sebastián, and at Kunsthalle Bremen. Other recent solo shows include the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Palacio de Cristal, Madrid (2017); Pirelli HangarBicocca, Milan (2017); Malmö Konsthall (2017); CAPC musée d'art contemporain de Bordeaux (2016-2017); Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt (2016); MIT Visual Arts Center, Cambridge, MA; Albertinum in Dresden; Center of Contemporary Art, Vilnius (2014); MAXXI, Rome (2014); Turner Contemporary in Margate (2013); Bergen Kunsthall (2013); MUSAC in Castilla y Leon (2013); Kunsthaus Zürich (2012), Jeu de Paume, Paris, (2012); Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis; Fondazione Galleria Civica, Trento, and MART, Rovereto (2011); Kunstverein Braunschweig (2011) and Tate Modern, London (2010). Barba has participated in the 52nd and 53rd and 56th Venice Biennale. At the 56th Biennale All the World's Futures, curated by Okwui Enwezor (2015), Barba exhibited Bending to Earth (2015). She participated in the Liverpool Biennale in 2010, in the 2nd Thessaloniki Biennale of Contemporary Art as well as in various festivals and other biennials. In 2010 she curated the group show A Curated Conference at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, Madrid with works from the collection. Afterwards the exhibition was the inspiration for the films The Hidden Conference I-III, which were performatively filmed in various museum depots. Amongst other references, her work relates to avant-garde film and Speculative fiction. Barba's works belong to collections such as Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humlebæk, Hamburger Bahnhof - Museum für Gegenwart, Berlin], Museo Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid, MACBA, Barcelona and Kunsthaus Zürich. Speaking about her participation in Performa 2013, Rosa Barba explains how she feels about live performance versus film/cinema: \\"My Performa piece brought a film to a live performance by using cinema as a new kind of stage. I created a new 35mm film, which was performed as a live event on the cinema screen in Anthology Film Archives’ screening theatre, whilst being fragmented around the space on 16mm films and filmic sculptures, which repeated an individual formal aspect, such as a sentence or a sound. Whilst almost behaving like characters, or stand-ins for the viewer, these films also interact with one another as though they were a splintered ensemble, fading in and out, and accompanied by an electronic musical accompaniment created by Jan St Werner of Mouse on Mars, and a group of professional voiceover actors who were performing live dialogue from various points in space. Subconscious Society – Live is an attempt to archive the last century, suggesting a paradigm shift, which is represented in the form of a social community, inhabiting a transitional realm, as they make a final attempt at assigning and archiving objects from the past. Here the past exists only as a reference to itself and the details of the present are not fully decipherable yet.\\" Also in this interview, she talks about her influences: \\"Literature has influenced personal and is exposed in my various work. I like to situate my work in a timeless, more precise space – space with a lot of layered time, so the exact time can’t be deciphered anymore, acted out by sound, images and text.\\" One of her works, ‘PARACHUTABLE’ was donated to the Rijksakademie and sold by auction at Sotheby’s Amsterdam ‘Global Contemporary, Rijksakademie’ – a big fundraising sale of approximately 120 Contemporary works of art, for the benefit of the Rijksakademie Artists' Endowment Fund, which will support present and future generations of talented artists working at the Rijksakademie by covering their research and production cost. =Film= Barba's films develop from situations that form societies and landscapes. By using her film camera like a drawing instrument, she outlines and relates directly with the formal properties of an object. She investigates environments and weaves stories of place and people into fictitious narratives that open up new possibilities for interpretation. For example, in the film Outwardly from Earth's Center that was produced on the Swedish island Gotland during the winter 2006 as a Production-in-Residence project for the Baltic Art Center in Sweden, Barba collaborated with the local inhabitants, who also performed in the film, to create narratives and form characters as the filming progressed. Outwardly from Earth's Center is constructed around a fictitious society living on the truly existing island of Gotska Sandön, which drifts approximately one meter per year and. The depiction of the small society trying to hold up the disappearance of the island develops into a surrealistic atmosphere that slowly but surely replaces the experience of what one might consider a beautiful documentary with a more abstract and somewhat absurd picture of people's struggle and vulnerability. =Sculpture and installation= Barba's sculptures and installations are created from the physical and conceptual components of film which become dissected, abstracted, compiled and arranged anew. The roles and relations of the various components are questioned and newly defined: the mechanical objects move, speak and become main protagonists in the exhibition space. For example, the piece Boundaries of Consumption (2012) features a 16 mm projector directed at film cans with silver globes balancing while the film runs through. The shadow of this spatial set-up is projected as moving images on the wall, changing in colour and appearance over time. =Publications= Since 2004 Barba has been publishing a series of printed editions parallel to her films as another form to express and dismantle the cinematic organism. She conjugates its repertoire while she disbands and defines the relationships and hierarchies between image and word and like between image and viewer anew. The series Printed Cinema which won the artist book award 2006 at the Ontario Association of Art Galleries is published for specific exhibition spaces and accompanies her films as secondary literature for a limited time. The printed editions present an extended and free form of the exhibited film which reveal the filming process including research material and unused filmic fragments. The edition exists beyond the duration of the film. The filmic projection is translated into printed material and confronted with its conditions, its materiality and temporality. Through the comparison of both media the emphasis on image, language and text and their relationships and overlapping themes are shifted into a new light.

The current members are Eddie Love, Rizz, Jon Woods, Eddie Mekelburg and Christian Sanchez. The band's first album, \\"The City Could Be Ours By Morning\\", was released in February, 2008. Their second album, \\"A Good Fight\\", was released May 1, 2010. The band is currently in the studio, recording their third release (their second full-length album), \\"The Kids Keep Asking for More\\".  History  2004 - 2006: Formation and early years = Jon and his brother Dustin (stage name Rizz) founded A Good Fight in 2004. They secured the federal trademark of A Good Fight through the law offices of Asa Hutchinson, who is now the governor of Arkansas. Dustin came up with the name of the band one evening, but then he and Jon decided the band name would be final after reflecting on close friend, Tim Berry, who had died in 1994 at the age of 16 in a fatal car accident. The verse in the Bible from II Timothy 4:7, \\"I have fought the good fight\\", is a tribute to their friend. They then reached out to local and popular drummer, Sean Marriott of Hot Springs, Arkansas, who at the time resided in Fayetteville, Arkansas. After the three met, they agreed this would be an attempt to form a band with the goal of seeking national recognition. Their next focus was finding a lead singer. During this time, Jon ran successfully for state representative. Drummer Sean Marriott also was briefly married during this time to Juliet of Fayetteville, Arkansas. She is a good friend of Billy Joe Armstrong of Green Day. Billy Joe wrote the song, \\"One for the Razorbacks\\", about her on the Kerplunk album \\". The band had set high goals and they were in no hurry to settle for a singer. After a grueling two year period and over 30 auditions, the band agreed to add vocalist Eddie Love to the lineup in 2006. = 2007 - 2009: First performance and success of first album = With the lineup complete in 2006, the band rehearsed and wrote material during most of 2006 and 2007. They performed their first show at George's Majestic Lounge in Fayetteville, Arkansas to a crowd of 400 fans on April 21, 2007. Their first album, The City Could be Ours by Morning, was released in February of 2008. It was released at a sold out show at George's Majestic Lounge to critical acclaim. Within just months of the release of the album, the band won a nationwide MTV contest in which 4000 bands competed to have their music played during an MTV reality show.[5] Over a half a million votes were cast and A Good Fight received an overwhelming number of them for the music video for their debut single, \\"The Drama\\". MTV contacted the group, after they won the competition, and hosted a party for them at the Embassy Suites John Q. Hammons Center in Rogers, Arkansas, August 1, 2008. The song was played during the season finale of A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila , several episodes of Made, and their music video for \\"The Drama\\" was also played on MTV. Due to the popular response of their first album, the band was invited to play at the SXSW Music Festival in Austin, Texas on March 21, 2009. = 2010 - 2013: Second album release and continued commercial success = They went back into the studio in 2009 and began working on their next album, the self-titled, \\"A Good Fight\\". The second album was released on May 1, 2010, to another sold out show at George's Majestic Lounge to critical acclaim. With extensive touring, the lifestyle of the road took its toll on the drummer, Sean Marriott, who asked to be replaced on good terms. In October 2010, drummer Rob Lee replaced Sean as the new drummer of A Good Fight. The band toured extensively. In early 2011, Rob Lee approached the band about bringing in a good friend and talented guitarist, Eddie Mekelburg. The band was hesitant at first but became open to the idea of having the sound of a second guitar in their live performances. Eddie Mekelburg's talent impressed the band members and they all agreed to add him to the band. On May 28, 2011, the band played at Rocklahoma in Pryor, Oklahoma and again on May 26, 2012, where drummer Rob Lee met his future wife. Several months later, Rob asked to be replaced on good terms so that he could focus on law school and his new relationship. In August 2012, Christian Sanchez was named the new drummer for A Good Fight. Jon took a break from the road to focus on his new position. He had recently been elected to the Arkansas State Senate and was replaced on the road by experienced, local bassist, Jake Norton in August, 2012. Jon still had a presence in the band, producing the new recordings for a third album, and a manager role. In 2013 the band consisted of Eddie Love, Rizz, Eddie Mekelburg, Jake Norton and Christian Sanchez.

What they are doing is very impressive and deadly catchy at times. A GOOD FIGHT is playing modern day American Melodic Pop-rock, a few steps away from bands like Weezer, Good Charlotte, Simple Plan, The Click Five and such, but somehow with a wink to the 1980s in the guitar riff department, such as the glam metalHair Metal riff in the song “Rips Like A Motor”. However, the music is American High School catchy day catchy Melodic Pop-rock, short but sweet and....quite good. The band also released a mini-CD, but with this [self] titled full-length CD they show they are ready for the major labels, because also the sound/production is of a high level, despite this is an independent release.

The show derived its title and the main characters Rogers, Towne, and Marriner from the 1937 novel of the same name by Kenneth Roberts, and from the 1940 MGM feature film based on the novel. The scope of the novel was much broader than that of the series, and the second half of the book included an historically based attempt by Rogers to find a water route through North America as a \\"passage\\" to the Pacific Ocean. This attempt, lending its name to the novel and used by Roberts as a metaphor for the questing human spirit, is referenced in the first episode. One of the earlier series telecast in color, Northwest Passage aired new episodes on NBC from September 14, 1958, to March 13, 1959.

The archaeological research in Minoan palaces, cemeteries and settlements has brought to light a multitude of objects related to beautification. Edmond Pottier gave her the name as he felt she resembled a contemporary woman from Paris. It seems that there were beautification areas in the palaces of Knossos, Zakros and Pylos. These beauty objects were used during the whole Aegean Bronze Age. By using these objects, the Minoan ladies highlighted the red lips and the white of the face. In the fresco of the Parisienne, the use of the black colour for emphasizing the form of the eyes and red for the lips can clearly be seen.

She was the first ship of the Coast and Geodetic Survey to bear the name. Construction and United States Navy service Pioneer was laid down as the United States Navy minesweeper USS Osprey (Minesweeper No. 29) by Gas Engine and Power Company at Morris Heights, New York, on 14 November 1917. She was launched on either 14 November 1918 or 19 November 1918 and was commissioned on 7 January 1919. Osprey assisted in sweeping the North Sea Mine Barrage in 1919. She spent 1920 in ordinary at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and was redesignated AM-29 that year. She was decommissioned at Portsmouth on 12 December 1920. United States Coast and Geodetic Survey career In 1922 Osprey steamed to Boston, Massachusetts, where she was transferred to the U.S. Department of Commerce on 7 April 1922. She entered service in the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey that year as the survey ship Pioneer. Pioneer and survey ships USC&GS; Discoverer—formerly the U.S. Navy minesweeper USS Auk (AM-38)—and USC&GS; Guide—formerly the U.S. Navy minesweeper USS Flamingo (AM-32)—were collectively known in the Coast and Geodetic Survey as the \\"Bird Boats\\" because of their former Navy names. Pioneer spent her Coast and Geodetic Survey career on duties on the United States West Coast and in the Territory of Alaska. Tragedy struck Pioneer on 11 October 1928 when a member of her crew -- Seaman Earl Forsberg—fell overboard and drowned during a survey of Heceta Bank off the coast of Oregon. In 1934 personnel aboard Pioneer developed a deep sea hydrophone in connection with the Survey's work developing radio acoustic ranging, a system in which a small TNT bomb timed to explode at about feet,This was the surface channel, not the deeper SOFAR channel. the explosion's sound wave is registered by a hydrophone aboard and hydrophones at two or more known shore locations that then send a radio signal of arrival time back to the vessel for range calculation, to better establish positions beyond shore signal visibility. Pioneer personnel successfully used the hydrophone to a depth of off the coast of southern California in the work establishing the velocity and path of sound in the sea. During her career, Pioneer occasionally rendered assistance to mariners in distress and assisted civil authorities ashore. On 28 November 1934, she sighted a yacht flying a distress signal; closing to investigate, she found that the yacht had a disabled engine and took it in tow off Point Vicente, California. On 20 December 1935, she was pierside at Long Beach, California, California, when a fire broke out on the pier; her crew contained the fire until the local fire department arrived on the scene. Return to U.S. Navy service In 1941, Pioneer was transferred back to the U.S. Navy, which commissioned her as the salvage ship USS Crusader (ARS-2). Crusader operated from the Panama Canal Zone throughout World War II. She was decommissioned in 1947 and sold in 1952. Commemoration Two underwater geographic features of the Pacific Ocean, Pioneer Seamount and Pioneer Canyon, are named for Pioneer.

From 1924 to 1937 sons of British seamen that had been killed or wounded during World War I were brought over, trained at Flock House, and placed on farms in New Zealand, to start a new life. From 1937 to 1987 New Zealand nationals were trained at the school. The complex was used by private owners since 1987 as a conference facility. The building Flock House is located at 1427 Parewanui Road, Parewanui, 14 km out of Bulls. The homestead was built by Russell & Bignell Ltd. in 1908, as a three-storey residence for Lyn McKelvie, and is now under Heritage New Zealand. The building has an 'L' shaped plan, and early elements of the Arts and Crafts style that became popular in New Zealand in the 1930s. McKelvie was the owner of an estate of over . The property, including the Homestead, was sold in 1923 to the Fund, that would use it as an agricultural training farm from then on. History of the school Following the First World War, Edward Newman, Member of Parliament for Rangitikei, proposed that sheep farmers in New Zealand should acknowledge a \\"debt\\" to the British Royal and Mercantile Navy. These seamen had kept the shipping lanes open enabling New Zealand's wool-clip to be sent to England. The New Zealand Farmers Union established the \\"New Zealand Sheep Owners Acknowledgement of Debt to British Seamen Fund\\", from farmers' wool-clip earnings and from 1921 funds were distributed to dependents in England. By 1924, the Fund purchased Flock House Farm in Bulls, Rangitikei, with the intention of bringing dependents to New Zealand, teaching them the basics of farming at Flock House, then placing them on farms around New Zealand. Between 1924 and 1937 a total of over 600 dependents were brought over, trained and placed on farms. In 1937 the Government negotiated the purchase of the farm and re-focused training towards New Zealand nationals. From 1969 to 1983, the principal of Flock House was JJ Stewart, also noted as a rugby union coach. In 1988 the facility was closed. By that time, more than 3,000 students had been successfully trained.Flock House History page on the Flockhouse website In early 2010 the site was used to host Camp A Low Hum, an alternative music festival over Wellington Anniversary Weekend.

The centrepiece of the Newcastle Programme was the primacy of Irish Home Rule, but associated with it were a raft of other reforms, in particular: taxation of land values; abolition of entail; extension of smallholdings; reform of the Lords; shorter parliaments; district and parish councils; registration reform and abolition of plural voting; local veto on drink sales; employers' liability for workers' accidents and disestablishment of the Church of England in Wales and Scotland. In the short run it proved a political liability. Liberals won the 1892 United Kingdom general election but failed to enact the Newcastle Programme. They were on the losing side in the 1895 United Kingdom general election and remained out of power until their landslide win in the 1906 United Kingdom general election. The Newcastle Programme was important for two reasons; first, it gave the Liberal party a Radical agenda on which to fight the next general election and second, the detailed 'shopping list' of policies it adopted was innovatory in British politics, setting a precedent for modern political parties. Today ordinary members of all major political parties participate in policy development and the parties present the electorate with a programme or manifesto for government, agreed or endorsed in some way by their members. Liberal campaigning The Liberal Party's leading pioneer of organised campaigning had been Joseph Chamberlain. In 1885, he put forward the Radical Programme, unauthorised by the party leadership, as an election manifesto for using the constructive power of the state but Liberal leader William Ewart Gladstone subverted Chamberlain's efforts, co-opting the NLF for mainstream Liberalism. By adopting Home Rule for Ireland as his banner, Gladstone trumped the Radical Programme, driving Chamberlain out of the party to form the Liberal Unionists. In the great schism of 1886 over Home Rule, the NLF deserted Chamberlain to remain loyal to Gladstone. Home Rule Between 1886 and 1891, Home Rule dominated Liberal policy debates but two events damaged their Irish allies. In 1887, The Times published letters, implicating Charles Stewart Parnell, the Irish Home Rule party leader, in the Phoenix Park murders of a government minister and a civil servant, although a high-profile government inquiry later discovered the letters to be forgeries. In 1890, the divorce of Katharine O'Shea, which identified Parnell as Mrs O'Shea's lover, split the Irish party and scandalised nonconformist Liberals. The split in the Irish Home Rule party in 1890 weakened the likelihood of a successful Home Rule Bill. At the 1891 meeting of the NLF in Newcastle upon Tyne Gladstone reaffirmed the primacy of Home Rule, but associated it with reforms on the mainland by adopting various proposals of the NLF Council, in particular: land reform; reform of the Lords; shorter parliaments; district and parish councils; registration reform and abolition of plural voting; local veto on drink sales; employers' liability for workers' accidents; Scottish and Welsh disestablishment. The Newcastle programme was to be the solution to these dilemmas, a manifesto for British government. National Liberal Federation Each year the National Liberal Federation met for debate in what may be seen as the forerunner of today's political party conferences. The NLF developed a process by which it passed an omnibus resolution incorporating all the policies that had been agreed in debate. In the autumn of 1891, the Federation met in Newcastle upon Tyne. In addition to Home Rule, the policies, which were crowded onto the omnibus, may be divided into three main areas: rural, religious and electoral reform. On 2 October 1891, Gladstone spoke to the NLF and for the first time, a Liberal Party leader had lent support to a programme proposed by the party's grass roots. However, one historian has argued that the Radicals inside the Liberal Party lacked the leadership to ensure their programme was truly implemented. Michael Bentley suggests that while Gladstone and the Liberal leadership was obliged to listen to the opinion of such a significant section of the party, they were able to slide along without making firm commitments and to pick and choose from the 'rag-bag' of policies that made up the Newcastle Programme, prioritising those they wanted and forgetting those they disliked. One of Gladstone's biographers also supports this assessment. Roy Jenkins asserts that Gladstone's only real interest now lay in Irish Home Rule, but he allowed John Morley and William Vernon Harcourt to cobble together the Newcastle Programme which he describes as 'a capacious ragbag... weak on theme'. According to Jenkins, Gladstone had neither the time nor energy to oppose the NLF programme and decided to swallow it whole just to ensure the party remained wedded to Home Rule as its principal policy. Gladstone's endorsement of the Newcastle Programme had one important outcome. A few weeks later, on 25 November, Lord Hartington, the leader of the Liberal Unionist Party, announced that there was no longer any hope of re-union with the Gladstonian Liberals. Failure to implement the Newcastle Programme The Liberal Party won the 1892 election, but its majority relied on Irish Nationalist support, and the results were far from the sort of endorsement from the electorate that Gladstone hoped. The new government was unable to enact much of the Newcastle Programme, even those parts that Gladstone approved, because of implacable opposition from the Conservative-dominated House of Lords. According to one historian of the Liberal Party, the Conservative leader Lord Salisbury justified their rejection of the Liberal measures including, crucially, Home Rule, on the basis that the Liberal victory in 1892 had rested on the votes of 150 electors in eight constituencies collected by offering many different policy bribes. Of the Newcastle Programme, the government's principal achievements were employers' liability, parish councils and William Vernon Harcourt's 1894 budget, which introduced graduated death duties. Gladstone resigned as prime minister in 1894 and was replaced with Lord Rosebery who poured scorn on the Newcastle Programme as the 'flyblown phylacteries of obsolete policies'.Douglas 2005, p. 106. When the government's efforts to bring in temperance reform and Welsh disestablishment also failed, Rosebery's disunited cabinet were almost anxious for an excuse to resign. The Conservatives won the 1895 general election ushering in ten years of Tory government. The Radical policy inheritance of the Newcastle Programme would have to wait for the reforming governments of Henry Campbell-Bannerman and H. H. Asquith before being cashed in.

He, along with Mark I. Gorenstein, predicted the threshold energy of the quark–gluon plasma production (the so-called \\"onset of deconfinement\\") in high energy nucleus-nucleus collisions. These predictions have been confirmed by the NA49 experiment at the CERN SPS within the energy scan programme which was started by him and Peter Seyboth.  Biography  Gaździcki was born on 9 June 1956 in Warsaw, Poland, as the son of Teresa and Jerzy Gaździcki. Living with his parents and his younger brother Pawel in Warsaw, he went to primary school in 1964 and graduated from high school in 1976. He studied physics at the Warsaw University from 1976 to 1980. After completing his first scientific degree, he married Maria Magdalena Klink, a computer scientist, who graduated from the Warsaw University of Technology. In the time from 1981 to 1984 he moved to Russia, where he became a researcher at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna. Back in Poland, he received his PhD in Physics, and became a lecturer at the Warsaw University in the time from 1989 to 1992. Additionally, he worked as a researcher at the University of Heidelberg (1986–1988) and at the University of Frankfurt/Main. Since 1992 he has been continuing studies as a Scientific Associate at the University of Frankfurt/M and from 2000 to 2001 at CERN, in Geneva, Switzerland. Since 2003, he holds a professorship at the Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce, Poland, and works as researcher and outside lecturer at the University of Frankfurt/Main. In 2004 he became spokesperson of the Virtual Institute of the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres: \\"Physics of Strongly Interacting Matter at High Densities\\" and in 2007 spokesperson of the NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS. Marek Gaździcki currently lives with his wife and three children in the area of Frankfurt/M, Germany.  Research  The most significant subjects investigated by Gaździcki are: *1980–1986: Nucleus-nucleus interactions at 4.5A GeV (Dubna and Warsaw) *1986–1992: Collisions of light nuclei at 20A GeV (Frankfurt/Main, Heidelberg and Warsaw) *1992–1996: Pb+Pb collisions at 158A GeV (CERN and Frankfurt/Main) *1994–1999: Predictions of the threshold for quark–gluon plasma production (Frankfurt/Main) *1997–2007: Evidence for the threshold at the low SPS energies (CERN and Frankfurt/Main) *since 1999: Low cross-section phenomena in Pb+Pb collisions at 158A GeV (CERN and Frankfurt/Main) *1990–1993: STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) (Warsaw and Frankfurt/Main) *since 1992: Event-by-event fluctuations and the ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) (Warsaw, Frankfurt/Main and CERN) *since 1998: Quarkonium production and high pT phenomena (CERN and Frankfurt/Main) *since 2003: NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS (Frankfurt/Main and Kielce) Selected achievements of Gaździcki's work are described as follows: 1980-1986: Nucleus-nucleus interactions at 4.5A GeV (Dubna and Warsaw) Starting in 1980, Gaździcki participated in the SKM200 experiment at the Dubna Synchrophasotron, focusing on the investigation of hadron production in (He-Mg)+(Li-Pb) collisions at 4.5A GeV using a streamer chamber. The main results – which constituted the basis for his PhD thesis – were the first measurements of strange hadron production in relativistic nucleus–nucleus collisions and a first observation of strange hadron yield enhancement in central A+A collisions. 1986-1992: Collisions of light nuclei at 200A GeV (Frankfurt/Main, Heidelberg and Warsaw) Subsequently, (1986–1992) he took part in the NA35 experiment at the CERN SPS, where he studied hadron production in (, )+(S-Pb) collisions at 200A GeV using a large volume streamer chamber. Here, a first observation of the enhancement of strange hadron production in A+A collisions at the SPS energies constituted the cardinal outcome of this experiment. This result constituted the main part of Gazdzicki's habilitation. 1992-1996: Pb+Pb collisions at 158A GeV (CERN and Frankfurt/Main) In 1992, Gaździcki began working on the NA49 experiment, which was based on time projection chambers, the time of flight detectors and calorimeters. The study of central Pb+Pb collisions at the top SPS energy confirmed the main result from the study of S+S interactions: the enhancement of strange hadron production in nucleus–nucleus collisions. 1994-1999: Predictions of the threshold for quark–gluon plasma production (Frankfurt/Main) Gaździcki's further work (1994–1999) was focused on the compilation, analysis and the interpretation of experimental results on system size and energy dependence of pion and strangeness production in A+A collisions, as well as the development of statistical models of strong interactions. Based upon these testings, Gaździcki observed the anomaly in energy dependence of pion and strange hadron yields in A+A collisions. Furthermore, he suggested that this anomaly is due to the transition to deconfinement matter occurring between top AGS (15A GeV) and top SPS (158A GeV) energies. Lastly, along with Mark Gorenstein, he formulated the statistical model of the early stage which is a basis for the quantitative description of the observed effects, . Also available on the Acta Physica Polonica B website and further predictions concerning the threshold for the quark–gluon plasma production. 1997-2007: Evidence for the threshold at the low SPS energies (CERN and Frankfurt/Main) Based upon these results in 1997 Gaździcki, together with Peter Seyboth, initiated the energy scan with Pb+Pb collisions at the CERN SPS which was performed by NA49 from 1998 to 2002. The main results of this programme are: the observation of the onset of the steepening of energy dependence of pion yield at about 30A GeV (kink), the observation of the non-monotonic energy dependence of positively charged kaon to pion ratio with the maximum located close to 30A GeV (horn), and the observation of the anomaly in energy dependence of the transverse mass spectra of kaons (step) located in the SPS energy range. These observations serve as evidence for the onset of deconfinement at the CERN SPS energies. Since 1992: Event-by-event fluctuations (Warsaw, Frankfurt/Main and CERN) In 1992 he started along with his collaborators the work on the development of statistical methods for the study of event-by-event fluctuations, as well as the study of physics of event-by-event fluctuations in A+A collisions. The most important results are the introduction of the commonly used measure of event-by-event fluctuations, and the cumulative variable for the correlation/fluctuation study, as well as the study of fluctuations and statistical models with conserved quantities. Since 1998: Quarkonium production and high pT phenomena (CERN and Frankfurt/Main) Since 1998, Gaździcki, together with Mark Gorenstein, has been aiming at the compilation and interpretation of the data on the production of high (transverse) mass mesons, and at the development of the statistical model of strong interactions for high (transverse) mass domain. As a result, they discovered the independence of the to the pion ratio of the system size in A+A collisions at 158A GeV. Moreover, they formulated the hypothesis of the statistical production of mesons, and they found the mT power-law scaling in high mT domain in proton-proton interactions at high energies. Conclusively, the statistical interpretation of the scaling was formulated. Since 2003: NA61/SHINE experiment at the CERN SPS (Frankfurt/Main and Kielce) Motivated by the discovery of the threshold of the quark–gluon plasma production in 2003 Gaździcki initiated and became spokesperson of the NA61/SHINE experiment. The principal goals of this experiment are: the search of the critical point of strongly interacting matter, the study of the properties of the onset of deconfinement in nucleus-nucleus collisions and precision measurements of hadron production in nuclear interactions for neutrino (T2K) and cosmic-ray (Pierre Auger Observatory and KASCADE) experiments.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles, Toronto Blue Jays, and Arizona Diamondbacks. Early life Reimold was born to John and Mary Reimold on October 12, 1983 in Greenville, Pennsylvania. He attended Kennedy Catholic High School in Hermitage, Pennsylvania. In addition to baseball, he was also on the basketball team in a traditional football-heavy stronghold of Western Pennsylvania. Reimold attended Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio, the same as former Bowie Baysox teammate Jeff Hundley and Major League relief pitcher Burke Badenhop. Reimold currently holds the career records at Bowling Green State for home runs and runs batted in (RBI). Reimold was an all Mid-American Conference outfielder in 2004, and a 3rd-team All American as a designated hitter in 2005. He was named National Hitter of the Week on March 28, 2005. He led the Mid-American Conference (MAC) in home runs (20), RBIs (60), total bases (137), on-base percentage (.496), and slugging percentage (.770) throughout the 2005 regular season, only to be second in batting (.360) behind fellow Falcon teammate, Andy Hudak. Career Reimold was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles as their 2nd round pick (61st overall) in the 2005 MLB Draft. He became the fourth highest Falcon ever drafted and just the third Falcon drafted in the top two rounds. He also became first Falcon ever to be named All-America by three different outlets in one season which were the NCBWA Second Team, ABCA Third Team, Baseball America Third Team. After signing, he played for the Aberdeen IronBirds and Frederick Keys, and was a New York–Penn League all-star for the IronBirds. He continued to play with the Frederick Keys for the 2006 season, and was the MVP for the Carolina League's all-star game. He started the 2007 season with the Bowie Baysox but was sidelined shortly thereafter with an oblique strain. After a brief rehab stint with the Gulf Coast Orioles, Reimold returned to the Baysox to finish the rest of the season. =2008= He continued playing for the Bowie Baysox for the 2008 season, and was named an Eastern League post-season all-star. In game two of Bowie's match-up with the Akron Aeros in the first round of the Eastern League playoffs, Reimold hit three home runs for the first time in his career en route to finishing 4-for-5 with eight RBIs. Reimold played for the Surprise Rafters in the Arizona Fall League during the 2008 Winter Baseball season. Baseball America named him the 5th-best prospect in the Orioles' farm system for the 2009 season. =2009= He reported to the Norfolk Tides, the Orioles' Triple-A team to begin the 2009 season, and was recalled to the major league club on May 14 collecting his first major league hit that night off Ron Mahay, then would collect his first major league RBI and double, both off Royals pitcher Kyle Davies on May 16. Reimold hit his first career home run on May 20, 2009 against the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium off Mariano Rivera. On May 27, 2009, Reimold hit his first walk off home run against the Toronto Blue Jays in the 11th inning to give the Orioles a 12-10 victory. Nolan won the American League Rookie of the Month award for June 2009. On September 18, the Orioles decided to shut down Reimold for the rest of the season due to fraying in his left Achilles tendon. The surgery was successful to repair the Achilles, but the rehab was not complete until late in the 2010 year, causing many of his future issues. =2010= Reimold started the season with the Baltimore Orioles as the starting left fielder. After a slow start in his first 83 at-bats, Reimold was demoted back to Norfolk on May 12, 2010, where the coaching staff was retooling him to play first base. Since that time, the Orioles released their starting first baseman Garrett Atkins, which may allow Reimold to rejoin the Orioles after the All-Star Break. =2011= Reimold had a successful 2011 campaign with most of his playing time in left field after Luke Scott tore his labrum and Félix Pie was sent down to the minor leagues. In the season finale against the visiting Boston Red Sox, he tied the game on an RBI double and crossed the plate for the game-winning run. The loss, coupled with the walk-off win by the Tampa Bay Rays minutes later, eliminated the Red Sox from playoff contention. =2012= Reimold started the 2012 season strong playing in left field, hitting .313 with five home runs and 10 RBIs in his first 16 games, but was plagued by injuries, including a herniated cervical disk, that put him on the disabled list after April 30. He was moved to the 60-day disabled list on June 12. On June 22, it was announced Reimold would undergo surgery to repair the disk in his neck, which ended his season. =2013= Reimold struggled in 2013, dealing with more injuries and batting .195 with five home runs and 12 RBIs in 40 games. In order to fix the procedure performed the previous June, he was once again forced to undergo season-ending corrective surgery after limited playing time. After the season, Reimold signed a one-year contract with the Orioles, promising him just over $1 million for the 2014 season while avoiding arbitration. =2014= Reimold was designated for assignment by the Orioles on July 1, 2014. He was claimed off waivers by the Toronto Blue Jays on July 6. After 4 games played with the Blue Jays, in which he batted .333 with 3 RBI, Reimold was placed on the 15-day DL with a left calf strain on July 12. On July 31, 2014, Reimold went 2 for 4 including 2 home runs against the Houston Astros to lead the Blue Jays to a 6-5 victory. He was designated for assignment on August 26 when Kevin Pillar was recalled. On August 28, Reimold was claimed off waivers by the Arizona Diamondbacks. =2015= On February 3, 2015, Reimold signed a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles that included an invitation to spring training. In April 2015, Reimold was assigned to AAA Norfolk. In June, the Orioles recalled Reimold from AAA Norfolk. He was designated for assignment on August 24, and brought back up on September 6. =2016= At the All-Star break, Reimold hit .268 (33-for-123) in 57 games with 4 homers and 11 RBIs. On July 24, Reimold hit his third career walk off home run off of Cleveland Indians pitcher Cody Allen to defeat the Indians 5-3. =2017= Reimold signed with the Long Island Ducks of the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball in early 2017.

The physical constants reported in this paper are as follows: m.p. 55–57 °C; [α] = + 47.9° (c 2.4, in ethanol). Pharmacology Early, classical pharmacological studies of phenylethanolamine were carried out by Tainter, who observed its effects after administering it to rabbits, cats and dogs. The drug produced a rapid rise in blood pressure when administered intravenously, but had little or no effect when given by any other route: doses as high as 200 mg given subcutaneously to rabbits did not alter blood pressure, nor were there any effects when the drug was intubated into the stomach. In man, a total oral dose of 1 g also produced no effects. Doses of 1–5 mg/kg, intravenously, caused no definite changes in respiration in cats or rabbits, and additional experiments showed that phenylethanolamine had no broncho-dilatory properties in animals. There was a similar lack of effect when the drug was given subcutaneously to man. In vivo and in vitro experiments involving cat and rabbit intestinal smooth muscle showed that the drug produced relaxation and inhibition. A detailed examination of the mydriatic effect of phenylethanolamine led Tainter to conclude that this drug acted by direct stimulation of the radial dilator muscle in the eye. Shannon and co-workers confirmed and extended some of Tainter's studies. After administering phenylethanolamine to dogs intravenously, these investigators observed that 10–30 mg/kg of the drug increased pupil diameter, and decreased body temperature; a dose of 10 or 17.5 mg/kg decreased heart rate, but a 30 mg/kg dose caused it to increase. Other effects that were noted included profuse salivation and piloerection. Phenylethanolamine also produced behavioral effects such as stereotyped head movement, rapid eye movement, and repetitive tongue extrusion. These and other observations were suggested to be consistent with an action on α- and β-adrenergic receptors.H. E. Shannon, E. J. Cone and D. Yousefnejad (1981). \\"Physiologic effects and plasma kinetics of phenylethanolamine and its N-methyl homolog in the dog.\\" J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 217 379–385. Research by Carpéné and co-workers showed that phenylethanolamineThe drug was tested in the form of a racemic mixture. did not significantly stimulate lipolysis in cultured adipocytes (\\"fat cells\\") from guinea pig or human. Moderate stimulation (intrinsic activities about half that of the reference standard, isoprenaline) was observed in adipocytes from rat or hamster. This lipolysis was inhibited completely by bupranolol (considered to be a non-selective β-blocker), CGP 20712A (considered to be a selective β1-antagonist), and ICI 118,551 (considered to be a selective β2-antagonist), but not by SR 59230A (considered to be a selective β3-antagonist).C.

Pharmacol. 65 1181–1190. found that in wild-type receptors, racemic phenylethanolamineNamed imprecisely as \\"hydroxyphenethylamine\\" had ~ 1/400 x the affinity of epinephrine, and ~ 1/7 x the affinity of norepinephrine in competition experiments with 3[H]-CGP-12177.Considered to be an antagonist of β1 and β2 receptors, and an agonist of β3 receptors. The two enantiomers of phenylethanolamine were studied for their interaction with the human trace amine associated receptor (TAAR1) by a research group at Eli Lilly. From experiments with human TAAR1 expressed in rGαsAV12-664 cells, Wainscott and co-workers observed that R-(−)-phenylethanolamine (referred to as \\"R-(−)-β-hydroxy-β-phenylethylamine\\") had an ED50 of ~1800 nM, with an Emax of ~ 110%, whereas S-(+)-phenylethanolamine (referred to as \\"S-(+)-β-hydroxy-β- phenylethylamine\\") had an ED50 of ~1720 nM, with an Emax of ~ 105%. In comparison, β-phenethylamine itself had an ED50 of ~106 nM, with an Emax of ~ 100%. \\"Table 3\\" In other words, phenylethanolamine is a TAAR1 agonist and trace amine. Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of phenylethanolamine, after intravenous administration to dogs, were studied by Shannon and co-workers, who found that the drug followed the \\"two-compartment model\\", with T1/2(α) ≃ 6.8 mins and T1/2(β) ≃ 34.2 mins; the \\"plasma half-life\\" of phenylethanolamine was therefore about 30 minutes. Biochemistry Phenylethanolamine was found to be an excellent substrate for the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyl transferase (PNMT), first isolated from monkey adrenal glands by Julius Axelrod, which transformed it into N-methylphenylethanolamine.J.Axelrod (1962). \\"Purification and properties of phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase.\\" J. Biol. Chem. 237 1657–1660. Subsequent studies by Rafferty and co-workers showed that substrate specificity of PNMT from bovine adrenal glands for the different enantiomers of phenylethanolamine was in the order R-(−)-PEOH > R,S-(racemic)-PEOH > S-(+)-PEOH. Toxicology The minimum lethal dose (m.l.d.) upon subcutaneous administration to guinea pigs was ~ 1000 mg/kg; the m.l.d. upon intravenous administration to rabbits was 25–30 mg/kg.; in rats, the m.l.d. after intravenous administration was 140 mg/kg.

The first appeared in Dr. Strange, Sorcerer Supreme #32 (August 1991) in a story written by Roy Thomas and Jean-Marc Lofficier. The second and current Phobos first appeared in the 2006 Ares: God of War mini- series (written by Michael Avon Oeming; art by Travel Foreman). He is the son of Ares, step-brother to Hippolyta, and a member of the Secret Warriors. Due to the nature of gods in the Marvel Universe, in addition to the retcon surrounding the current Phobos (see below) the relationship between the two has not been explicitly explained. OriginalPublication history= The original Phobos first appeared in the \\"A Gathering of Fear\\" storyline in Dr. Strange, Sorcerer SupremeDoctor Strange (vol. 3), started off as Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme, renamed D. Strange, Sorcerer Supreme in issue #4 #32 (August 1991) written by Roy Thomas and Jean-Marc Lofficier. He reappeared in \\"The Great Fear\\" storyline in DS:SS #39 (March 1992). =Fictional biography= Phobos and his brother Deimos are sons of Ares and Nox (posing as Venus) but were killed by Thor and Hercules in their first appearance.Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme #32 (August 1991) Later the Fear Lords release so much fear that Nox is able to bring her sons back, creating them from the Darkforce but they were eventually defeated again.Doctor Strange: Sorcerer Supreme #39 (March 1992) Phobos meets his final fate when Amatsu-Mikaboshi assaults Olympus and kills him.Ares: God of War #3 (March 2006) AlexanderPublication history= The current Phobos, Alexander, first appeared in the Ares limited series in 2006 written by Michael Avon Oeming. Here, he is manipulated by Amatsu-Mikaboshi into becoming a warrior until his father, Ares, saves him many years later, a young adult with god-like powers. This ending is ignored for future storyline purposes. The character returns, retconned by Brian Michael Bendis and reduced to a ten-year-old boy with no specialized training in Mighty Avengers #1, then reappears in the Secret Invasion crossover, in Mighty Avengers and the Secret Invasion limited series. Once Dark Reign started, he began appearing regularly in Secret Warriors. =Fictional character biography= The current Phobos is a young boy named Alexander Aaron.Ares: God of War #1 (March 2006) In the 2006 Ares: God or War mini-series, Alexander is taken from his father, Ares, by Zeus, and then kidnapped by the Japanese god Amatsu-Mikaboshi. Mikaboshi, in an attempt to destroy the Marvel pantheons, trains and manipulates Alex for at least five Olympian years - which vary substantially from human years in that years can pass to the gods while simultaneously only a few days or months passing for humans - under the guise of a mother-figure who eventually turns him into a deadly swordsman. He is saved from the evil deity when the combination of Zeus and Ares's influences broke his brainwashing. Their salvation apparently eliminates his skills. Brian Michael Bendis then ret-conned these events in Mighty Avengers. When Alex / Phobos is first approached by fellow Secret Warrior Daisy, he is once again a young boy, untrained, and aware that his father is the god Ares (Mighty Avengers #13). (The general story of Mikaboshi destroying the Marvel pantheons and Zeus' sacrifice remains canon however).Incredible Hercules #117 It's at this point that Daisy reveals to Alex that he is Phobos. After this, he begins to gain fear like powers, having inherited the original's abilities. However, in Mighty Avengers #13 he scared off a couple of boys, and after that he lied to Daisy that he doesn't have any powers, but she doesn't believe him. After talk with her he says 'that explains so much' because he realises then that he's new Phobos, and was born mortal, but after drinking Mikaboshi's blood he became god and now he has fear powers and Daisy told him who he really is (new god of fear). In that issue Ares tells him that he's an Avenger right now and he cannot worry about his grades. During the Secret Invasion storyline, Alex is recruited by Nick Fury for his team of Secret Warriors.Secret Invasion Post-invasion, he remains a member of the team and has shown evidence of additional pre-cognitive powers. However, his father has noticed his absence upon receiving a truancy notice.Dark Avengers #5 In the aftermath of Utopia, Ares followed Alex and Daisy to one of Fury's base, where he discovers his son's affiliation with the former S.H.I.E.L.D. director. Fury tells Ares that his son has potential. Ares ultimately accepts his son's decision, meaning that he doesn't need to hide his allegiance anymore.Dark Avengers #9 Phobos later pilots a Fury Life Model Decoy to assist Black Widow and Songbird but they are captured by the Thunderbolts. As soon as Norman Osborn shoots the LMD in the head, Phobos reveals himself, inflicting Osborn with the fear that he will lose his mind soon enough.Secret Warriors #8 During Siege, Phobos tried to tag along with the other secret warriors to help the Asgardians, but Nick Fury wouldn't let him, because he knew his father would die and he didn't want him to witness it. When the fiasco was over, Thor confronted Phobos telling him that Ares was dead and he offered to take him to see his next of kin in Mount Olympus. However, he declined his offer. Thor offered that if he ever changed his mind, he would take him there. Although he had mixed feelings with his dad, he still felt sad that he died. Phobos is now in Elysium after having been stabbed and killed by Gorgon wielding the sword Godkiller. His last appearance had his father proud of his actions as they were reunited in the afterlife.Secret Warriors #22 Powers and abilities Both versions of Phobos control the power of fear, a power that has been seen to cause victims to run for their lives as well as attack their partners. Certain characters have proven immune to this ability (i.e. Nick Fury, Gorgon) - citing they lack fear as the reason.Secret Warriors #3 (March 2009) The current version of Phobos (Alex) was at one time a highly trained swordsman and possessed strength and endurance similar to other Olympian gods in the Marvel universe, however this has since been ret-conned. Secret Warriors #10 re-establishes his training with a sword. He was denied use of it by his father Ares, who required him to be proficient in all forms of arms before returning his sword. Currently he, like the previous Phobos, can instill fear in others. Additionally, he has shown evidence of pre-cognitive powers. When utilizing his fear based powers, Alex's eyes glow. The color has shown to vary between white and red. Whether this is simply due to the artist's rendering or the level of power usage is unknown. Relationship between the two characters Currently, it is unclear whether the original Phobos and the current Alex are actually two separate characters. Examining their respective first appearances it would appear that they are, as both have distinct personalities and ability sets. In fact, their father Ares even explicitly states that both are separate individuals within the 2006 Ares: God of War mini-series. However, this mini-series takes place before Brian Michael Bendis retconned the origin and abilities of Alex. Within the mini-series Alex had grown well into his late teens, had acquired a mastery of almost all forms of weaponry, and was well aware of his divine heritage. However, when Alex next appears in Mighty Avengers #13 he is barely 10, has no combat experience, and is aware that his father is the god Ares. It is also in Mighty Avengers #13 that Alex is first identified as Ares' son Phobos, and displays abilities similar to the original version of the character.Mighty Avengers #13 (July 2008) Thus, it would appear that Bendis retconned the events of the mini-series and that Alex and Phobos are potentially the same character. Adding to the confusion, based on the events in The Incredible Hercules #117 it seems that parts of the Ares: God of War mini-series are, in fact, still considered canon. Namely, Mikaboshi's plot and attempt to destroy the divine pantheons in the Marvel Universe. Since Alex's capture and development were central to Mikaboshi's plan, yet also directly contradict his later appearances in Mighty Avengers and Secret Warriors, the current status of both characters remains unclear. According to the Thor & Hercules: Encyclopaedia Mythologica, the original Phobos and the current Alex are two separate characters. More specifically, they are half-brothers. The Phobos profile indicates that the original Phobos (and his brother Deimos) were killed during Mikaboshi's invasion of Olympus, and that Alexander inherited the fear-based powers of his slain older half-brother following his return to Earth. Dark Reign: New Nation #1 states the Ares: God of War limited series as the first appearance of Alex.

In essence, in some problems including plane strain and plane stress elastic-plastic problems, elastic part of the material prevent unrestrained plastic flow but in many metal-forming processes, such as rolling, drawing, gorging, etc., large unrestricted plastic flows occur except for many small elastic zones. in effect we are concerned with a rigid-plastic material under condition of plane strain. it turns out that the simplest way of solving stress equations is to express them in terms of a coordinate system that is along potential slip (or failure) surfaces. It is for this reason that this type of analysis is termed slip line analysis or the theory of slip line fields in the literature.

The community was once a prominent mining town. Tincup is now a community of summer homes with a few year-round residents. Many historic buildings are still in use. History In October 1859, prospector Jim Taylor panned some gold from Willow Creek, and carried it back to camp in a tin cup; he named the valley “Tin Cup Gulch.” For years the area was the site of seasonal placer mining, but no year-round communities were established, partly because of the danger of Indian attack. In 1878, lode deposits were discovered in the area, and the town of Virginia City was laid out in March 1879. By the 1880 census, the town had a population of 1,495. Virginia City was incorporated in August 1880, but confusion with Virginia City, Nevada, and Virginia City, Montana, caused the residents to change the name. The town was reincorporated in July 1882 as Tin Cup. Early Tin Cup was a violent place. Town marshal Harry Rivers died in a gunfight in 1882, and marshal Andy Jameson was shot to death in 1883. The town population declined when the mines were exhausted. The post office closed in 1918, and the last town election was held in 1918.

In mammals including humans, nitric oxide is a signaling molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes. It is a powerful vasodilator with a half-life of a few seconds in the blood. Standard pharmaceuticals such as nitroglycerine and amyl nitrite are precursors to nitric oxide. Low levels of nitric oxide production are typically due to ischemic damage in the liver. As a consequence of its importance in neuroscience, physiology, and immunology, nitric oxide was proclaimed \\"Molecule of the Year\\" in 1992. Research into its function led to the 1998 Nobel Prize for elucidating the role of nitric oxide as a cardiovascular signalling molecule. Sources of nitric oxideNitric oxide biosynthesis= Platelet-derived factors, shear stress, acetylcholine, and cytokines stimulate the production of NO by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). eNOS synthesizes NO from the terminal guanidine-nitrogen of L-arginine and oxygen and yields citrulline as a byproduct. NO production by eNOS is dependent on calcium-calmodulin and other cofactors. Nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) synthesize the metastable free radical nitric oxide (NO). Three isoforms are known for the NOS enzyme: endothelial (eNOS), neuronal (nNOS), and inducible (iNOS) - each with separate functions. The neuronal enzyme (NOS-1) and the endothelial isoform (NOS-3) are calcium-dependent and produce low levels of this gas as a cell signaling molecule. The inducible isoform (NOS-2) is calcium-independent and produces large amounts of gas that can be cytotoxic. NOS oxidizes the guanidine group of L-arginine in a process that consumes five electrons and results in the formation of NO with stoichiometric formation of L-citrulline. The process involves the oxidation of NADPH and the reduction of molecular oxygen. The transformation occurs at a catalytic site adjacent to a specific binding site of L-arginine.Ignarro L.J. (1990): Nitric Oxide. A Novel Signal Transduction Mechanism For Transcellular Communication; Hypertension; 16(5): 477-483. NO is an important regulator and mediator of numerous processes in the nervous, immune, and cardiovascular systems. These include vascular smooth muscle relaxation, resulting in arterial vasodilation and increasing blood flow.Weller, Richard, Could the sun be good for your heart? TedxGlasgow March 2012, posted January 2013 NO is also a neurotransmitter and has been associated with neuronal activity and various functions such as avoidance learning. NO also partially mediates macrophage cytotoxicity against microbes and tumor cells. Besides mediating normal functions, NO is implicated in pathophysiologic states as diverse as septic shock, hypertension, stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases.Davies, S.A., Stewart, E.J., Huesmaan, G.R and Skaer, N. J. (1997): Neuropeptide stimulation of the nitric oxide signalling pathway in Drosophila melanogaster Malpighian tubules. Am. J. Physiol..; 273, R823-827. Pathway for nitrosylation of heme- thiolate, steps in cell signalling (porphyrin is depicted as the square). =Exogenous NO (NO-delivery drugs)= Exogenous NO sources constitute a powerful way to supplement NO when the body cannot generate enough for normal biological functions. Certain endogenous compounds can act as NO-donors or elicit NO-like reactions in vivo. Nitroglycerin and amyl nitrite serve as vasodilators because they are converted to nitric oxide in the body. The vasodilating antihypertensive drug minoxidil contains an ·NO moiety and may act as an NO agonist. Likewise, Sildenafil citrate, popularly known by the trade name Viagra, stimulates erections primarily by enhancing signaling through the nitric oxide pathway. Prominent examples are S-nitrosothiols, certain organic nitrates, nitrosylated metal complexes, dinitrosyl iron complexes (DNIC), and even nitrite anions (NO2− ) under hypoxic conditions Radicals for life: The various forms of nitric oxide. E. van Faassen and A. Vanin, eds. Elsevier, Amsterdam 2007. .Nitrite as regulator of hypoxic signaling in mammalian physiology. Med Res Rev 29, 2009, 683 - 741 A high salt intake attenuates NO production in patients with essential hypertension, although bioavailability remains unregulated. =Other, including dietary= Dietary nitrate is also an important source of nitric oxide in mammals. Green, leafy vegetables and some root vegetables (such as beetroot) have high concentrations of nitrate. When eaten and absorbed into the bloodstream, nitrate is concentrated in saliva (about 10-fold) and is reduced to nitrite on the surface of the tongue by a biofilm of commensal facultative anaerobic bacteria. This nitrite is swallowed and reacts with acid and reducing substances in the stomach (such as ascorbate) to produce high concentrations of nitric oxide. The purpose of this mechanism to create NO is thought to be both sterilization of swallowed food (to prevent food poisoning) and to maintain gastric mucosal blood flow. The nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway elevates nitric oxide through the sequential reduction of dietary nitrate derived from plant-based foods. Nitrate-rich vegetables, in particular leafy greens, such as spinach and arugula, and beetroot, have been shown to increase cardioprotective levels of nitric oxide with a corresponding reduction in blood pressure in pre-hypertensive persons. For the body to generate nitric oxide through the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway, the reduction of nitrate to nitrite (by nitrate reductase, a bacterial enzyme) occurs in the mouth, by commensal bacteria, an obligatory and necessary step. Monitoring nitric oxide status by saliva testing detects the bioconversion of plant- derived nitrate into nitric oxide. A rise in salivary levels is indicative of diets rich in leafy vegetables which are often abundant in anti-hypertensive diets such as the DASH diet. A related mechanism is thought to protect the skin from fungal infections, where nitrate in sweat is reduced to nitrite by skin commensal organisms and then to NO on the slightly acidic skin surface. In alternative fashion, nitrite anions on sun-exposed skin may be photolyzed to free nitric oxide radicals by UVA in sunlight. This mechanism may elicit significant changes to the systemic blood circulation in humans and be exploited for therapeutic purposes. Nasal breathing also produces nitric oxide within the body. Immune response A dinitrosyl iron complex (DNIC), the product from the immune responsive attack of NO on Fe-S proteins.Nitric oxide is generated by phagocytes (monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils) as part of the human immune response. Phagocytes are armed with inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which is activated by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) as a single signal or by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) along with a second signal.Gorczyniski and Stanely, Clinical Immunology. Landes Bioscience; Austin, TX. On the other hand, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) provides a strong inhibitory signal to iNOS, whereas interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-10 provide weak inhibitory signals. In this way, the immune system may regulate the armamentarium of phagocytes that play a role in inflammation and immune responses. Nitric oxide is secreted as free radicals in an immune response and is toxic to bacteria and intracellular parasites, including Leishmania and malaria; the mechanism for this includes DNA damage Free text. free text and degradation of iron sulfur centers into iron ions and iron- nitrosyl compounds. The inducible pathway (iNOS) of nitrogen oxide synthesis in phagocytes can generate large amounts of NO that trigger apoptosis and kill other cells. In vitro studies indicate that phagocyte-dependent generation of NO at concentrations greater than 400-500 nM triggers apoptosis in nearby cells and that this effect may act in a manner similar to Specialized pro- resolving mediators to dampen and reverse inflammatory responses by neutralizing and then speeding the clearance of pro-inflammatory cells from inflamed tissues. However, the role of ·NO in inflammation is complex with model studies involving viral infection suggesting that this gaseous mediator can also promote inflammation. In response, many bacterial pathogens have evolved mechanisms for nitric oxide resistance. Because nitric oxide might serve as an inflammometer (meter of inflammation) in conditions like asthma, interest has increased in the use of exhaled nitric oxide as a breath test in diseases with airway inflammation. Reduced levels of exhaled NO have been associated with exposure to air pollution in cyclists and smokers, but, in general, increased levels of exhaled nitric oxide are associated with exposure to air pollution. Molecular effects of NO on biological systems In cells, two broad classes of reactions of nitric oxide involve the S-nitrosation of thiols and the nitrosylation of some metalloenzymes. =S-nitrosation of thiols= S-nitrosation involves the (reversible) conversion of thiol groups, including cysteine residues in proteins, to form S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs). S-Nitrosation is a mechanism for dynamic, post-translational regulation of most or all major classes of protein.van Faassen, E. and Vanin, A. (eds.) (2007) Radicals for life: The various forms of nitric oxide. Elsevier, Amsterdam, =Nitrosylation of metal centers, especially iron= Nitric oxide to a transition metal ion like iron or copper, forming metal nitrosyl complexes. Typical cases involve the nitrosylation of heme proteins like cytochromes, thereby disabling the normal enzymatic activity of the enzyme. Nitrosylated ferrous iron is particularly stable. Hemoglobin is a prominent example of a heme protein that may be modified by NO by both direct attack by NO and, independently, via attack by S-nitrosothiols, involving NO transfer from S to Fe.van Faassen, E. and Vanin, A. (2004) \\"Nitric Oxide\\", in Encyclopedia of Analytical Science, 2nd ed., Elsevier, . The iron-containing proteins ribonucleotide reductase and aconitase are deactivated by NO. NO has been demonstrated to activate NF-κB in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a transcription factor in iNOS gene expression in response to inflammation. =Guanylate cyclase= Although NO affects many metalloproteins, it does so by deactivating them. Guanylate cyclase is a key component of the famous smooth-muscle relaxing properties of NO. It is a heme-containing enzyme that is acted on by NO, which binds to the heme. Cyclic-GMP activates protein kinase G, which causes reuptake of Ca2+ and the opening of calcium-activated potassium channels. The fall in concentration of Ca2+ ensures that the myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) can no longer phosphorylate the myosin molecule, thereby stopping the crossbridge cycle and leading to relaxation of the smooth muscle cell. Smooth musclesVasodilation= Nitric oxide dilates blood vessels, raising blood supply and lowering blood pressure. Conversely, it helps protect tissues from damage due to low blood supply. Also a neurotransmitter, nitric oxide acts in the nitrergic neurons active on smooth muscle, abundant in the gastrointestinal tract and erectile tissue. Sildenafil (Viagra) works to inhibit the enzyme phosphodiesterase PDE5, which increases the cGMP concentration by inhibiting the conversion to GMP. Nitric oxide (NO) contributes to vessel homeostasis by inhibiting vascular smooth muscle contraction and growth, platelet aggregation, and leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. Humans with atherosclerosis, diabetes, or hypertension often show impaired NO pathways. Nitric oxide (NO) is a mediator of vasodilation in blood vessels. It is induced by several factors, and once synthesized by eNOS it results in phosphorylation of several proteins that cause smooth muscle relaxation. The vasodilatory actions of nitric oxide play a key role in renal control of extracellular fluid homeostasis and is essential for the regulation of blood flow and blood pressure. NO also plays a role in erection of the penis and clitoris. =Cardiac effects= Nitric oxide also acts on cardiac muscle to decrease contractility and heart rate. NO contributes to the regulation of cardiac contractility. Emerging evidence suggests that coronary artery disease (CAD) is related to defects in generation or action of NO. Reduced levels of exhaled NO have been associated with exposure to traffic related air pollution. Effects on plants In plants, nitric oxide can be produced by any of four routes: (i) L-arginine-dependent nitric oxide synthase, (although the existence of animal NOS homologs in plants is debated), (ii) plasma membrane-bound nitrate reductase, (iii) mitochondrial electron transport chain, or (iv) non-enzymatic reactions. It is a signaling molecule, acts mainly against oxidative stress and also plays a role in plant pathogen interactions. Treating cut flowers and other plants with nitric oxide has been shown to lengthen the time before wilting. In plants, NO also regulates some plant-pathogen interaction, promotion of the plant hypersensitive response, symbiosis (for example, with organisms in nitrogen- fixing root nodules), development of lateral and adventitious roots and root hairs, and control of stomatal opening. Nitric oxide is known to be produced by cellular organelles, including mitochondria, peroxisomes, and chloroplasts. It plays a role in antioxidant and reactive oxygen species responses.Verma, K., Mehta, S. K., & Shekhawat, G. S. (2013). Nitric oxide (NO) counteracts cadmium induced cytotoxic processes mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in Brassica juncea: cross-talk between ROS, NO and antioxidant responses. BioMetals: an international journal on the role of metal ions in biology, biochemistry, and medicine. Nitric oxide sensing in plants is mediated by the N-end rule of proteolysis and controls abiotic stress responses such as flooding-induced hypoxia, salt and drought stress. Nitric oxide interactions have been found within signaling pathways of plant hormones such as auxin,Terrile, M. C., París, R., Calderón‐Villalobos, L. I., Iglesias, M.

Atmospheric nitric oxide can enter the stomates of most vascular species, and can have effects ranging from leaf blemishing, to stunting of growth, to necrosis.C.Michael Hogan. 2010. \\"Abiotic factor\\" . Encyclopedia of Earth. eds Emily Monosson and C. Cleveland. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC Effects in insects Blood- sucking insects exploit vasodilation induced by NO to ensure their blood meal. These insects include Cimex lectularius (bed bug) and Rhodnius proxlixus (kissing bug). These insects deliver NO from its carrier nitrophorin, which is found in their saliva. Effects in bacteria While nitric oxide is typically known to halt bacterial growth as part of an immune response, in one case NO protects a bacterium. The bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans can withstand extreme levels of radioactivity and other stresses. In 2009 it was reported that nitric oxide plays an important role in this bacteria's recovery from radiation exposure: The gas is required for division and proliferation after DNA damage has been repaired. A gene that increases nitric oxide production after UV radiation was described, and in the absence of this gene the bacteria were still able to repair DNA damage, but would not grow. Medical uses In the European Union nitric oxide in conjunction with ventilatory support and other appropriate active substances, is indicated: * for the treatment of newborn infants ≥34 weeks gestation with hypoxic respiratory failure associated with clinical or echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension, in order to improve oxygenation and to reduce the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; * as part of the treatment of peri- and post-operative pulmonary hypertension in adults and newborn infants, infants and toddlers, children and adolescents, ages 0–17 years in conjunction to heart surgery, in order to selectively decrease pulmonary arterial pressure and improve right ventricular function and oxygenation. In the United States it is indicated to improve oxygenation and reduce the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in term and near-term (>34 weeks gestation) neonates with hypoxic respiratory failure associated with clinical or echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension in conjunction with ventilatory support and other appropriate agents. The most common side effects include thrombocytopenia (low blood platelet counts), hypokalaemia (low blood potassium levels), hypotension (low blood pressure), atelectasis (collapse of the whole, or part of a, lung), and hyperbilirubinaemia (high blood levels of bilirubin). Text was copied from this source which is © European Medicines Agency. Reproduction is authorized provided the source is acknowledged. Nitric oxide was approved for medical use in the United States in December 1999 and for medical use in the European Union in 2001. = Associated problems = There are some associated complaints with utilization of nitric oxide in neonatal patients. Some of them include dose errors associated with the delivery system, headaches associated with environmental exposure of nitric oxide in hospital staff, hypotension associated with acute withdrawal of the drug, hypoxemia associated with acute withdrawal of the drug, and pulmonary edema in patients with CREST syndrome. = Contraindications = Inhaled nitric oxide is contraindicated in the treatment of neonates known to be dependent on right-to-left shunting of blood. This is as the nitric oxide decreases the pulmonary circulation's resistance by dilating pulmonary blood vessels. The increased pulmonary return increases pressure in the left atrium, causing closure of the foramen ovale and reducing the blood flow through the ductus arteriosus. Closing these shunts can kill neonates with heart malformations that rely on the right-to-left shunting of blood. = Dosage and strength = In the United States, nitric oxide is a gas available in concentrations of only 100 ppm and 800 ppm. Overdosage with inhaled nitric oxide will be seen by elevations in methemoglobin and pulmonary toxicities associated with inspired ·NO. Elevated NO may cause acute lung injury. =Fatty liver disease= Nitric oxide production is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and is essential for hepatic lipid metabolism under starvation. =Lung infection= Nitric oxide is a potential therapeutic intervention in acute and chronic lung infections. = Mechanism of action = Nitric oxide is a compound produced by many cells of the body. It relaxes vascular smooth muscle by binding to the heme moiety of cytosolic guanylate cyclase, activating guanylate cyclase and increasing intracellular levels of cyclic-guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate, which then leads to vasodilation. When inhaled, nitric oxide dilates the pulmonary vasculature and, because of efficient scavenging by hemoglobin, has minimal effect on the vasculature of the entire body. Inhaled nitric oxide appears to increase the partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) by dilating pulmonary vessels in better-ventilated areas of the lung, moving pulmonary blood flow away from lung segments with low ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) ratios toward segments with normal or better ratios. = Neonatal use = Nitric oxide/oxygen blends are used in critical care to promote capillary and pulmonary dilation to treat primary pulmonary hypertension in neonatal patients and post-meconium aspiration related to birth defects. These are often a last-resort gas mixture before the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Nitric oxide therapy has the potential to significantly increase the quality of life and, in some cases, save the lives of infants at risk for pulmonary vascular disease. =Pathology= People with diabetes usually have lower levels of nitric oxide than patients without diabetes.nfb University Studies - Nitric Oxide Holds Promise for Diabetes Diminished supply of nitric oxide can lead to vascular damage, such as endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation. Vascular damage can lead to decreased blood flow to the extremities, causing the diabetic patient to be more likely to develop neuropathy and non-healing ulcers, and to be at a greater risk for lower limb amputation. = Pediatric and adult use = The primary use is in the form of nitroglycerin, either pill or liquid spray forms, which, as a prodrug, is denitrated and releases the active metabolite nitric oxide (NO). As with all supplements of nitric oxide, the response is short-lived because, as a normally produced internal physiologic control mechanism, increased concentrations lead to increased rates of clearance, which is the reason that the effectiveness of sustained use of nitroglycerin for vasodilation fades to none after hours to days. In the United States, ongoing direct use of nitric oxide use is only approved for neonates. In the adult ICU setting, inhaled ·NO can improve hypoxemia in acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and severe pulmonary hypertension, although the effects are short-lived and there are no studies demonstrating improved clinical outcomes. It is used on an individualized basis in ICUs as an adjunct to other definitive therapies for reversible causes of hypoxemic respiratory distress.  Pharmacokinetics  Nitric oxide is absorbed systemically after inhalation. Most of it moves across the pulmonary capillary bed where it combines with hemoglobin that is 60% to 100% oxygen-saturated. Nitrate has been identified as the predominant nitric oxide metabolite excreted in the urine, accounting for >70% of the nitric oxide dose inhaled. Nitrate is cleared from the plasma by the kidney at rates approaching the rate of glomerular filtration. = Pharmacology = Nitric oxide is considered an antianginal drug: It causes vasodilation, which can help with ischemic pain, known as angina, by decreasing the cardiac workload. By dilating (expanding) the arteries, nitric oxide drugs lower arterial pressure and left ventricular filling pressure. Nitric oxide can contribute to reperfusion injury when an excessive amount produced during reperfusion (following a period of ischemia) reacts with superoxide to produce the damaging oxidant peroxynitrite. In contrast, inhaled nitric oxide has been shown to help survival and recovery from paraquat poisoning, which produces lung tissue-damaging superoxide and hinders NOS metabolism. This vasodilation does not decrease the volume of blood the heart pumps, but rather it decreases the force the heart muscle must exert to pump the same volume of blood. Nitroglycerin pills, taken sublingually (under the tongue), are used to prevent or treat acute chest pain. The nitroglycerin reacts with a sulfhydryl group (–SH) to produce nitric oxide, which eases the pain by causing vasodilation. There is a potential role for the use of nitric oxide in alleviating bladder contractile dysfunctions, and recent evidence suggests that nitrates may be beneficial for treatment of angina due to reduced myocardial oxygen consumption both by decreasing preload and afterload and by some direct vasodilation of coronary vessels. = Pulmonary embolism = Nitric oxide is also administered as salvage therapy in patients with acute right ventricular failure secondary to pulmonary embolism.  Research  Nitric oxide production in marine archaea and bacteria should also be highlighted here. In progress. = COVID‑19 = , studies and trials are underway that examine the possible benefits of nitric oxide in the treatment of COVID‑19. This research is based on the fact that nitric oxide was investigated as an experimental therapy for SARS. Brian Strickland, MD, a fellow in Wilderness Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital who studies \\"acute respiratory distress\\" in high altitudes, is applying this research towards COVID‑19. He is involved in clinical trials which apply the use of inhaled nitric oxide as a treatment for COVID‑19. This approach was inspired by the work of Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine at the Harvard Medical School N. Stuart Harris, who has been studying the effects of altitude sickness on mountain climbers, such as those who climb Mount Everest. Harris noticed that the consequences of high level altitude sickness on the human body mirrored COVID‑19's dysfunctional impact on the lungs. His focus on nitric oxide comes from its role in being able to breathe in high altitudes. According to WCVB-TV, similar trials are being conducted at Tufts Medical Center. Other studies speculate that replacing mouth breathing (which decimates NO) with nasal breathing (which increases NO) is a \\"lifestyle change\\" that \\"may also help to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load and symptoms of COVID‑19 pneumonia by promoting more efficient antiviral defense mechanisms in the respiratory tract.\\"  References External links * Category:Gaseous signaling molecules Category:Nitrogen compounds Category:Nitrogen cycle ","title":"Biological functions of nitric oxide"},{"id":"20800150","text":"Juozas Aleksandras Jagelavičius (12 January 1939 – 17 June 2000) was a Lithuanian rower.

As a freshman, he earned the starter right cornerback position during the preseason practices and went on to become an impact player, registering 51 tackles (sixth on the team), 15 passes defensed (second in the nation) and one interception. As a sophomore, he was moved to left cornerback, collecting 59 tackles (sixth on the team), 15 passes deflected (eighth in the nation), 3 interceptions, one quarterback pressure, one forced fumble and one fumble recovery. He received All-American honors as a junior, after recording 53 tackles, 6 interceptions (second in school history) and 12 passes defensed. He combined with fellow cornerback DeAngelo Smith to register a total of 14 interceptions, the most by a cornerback duo in college football in 2007. He had 6 tackles and 2 interceptions, including one returned for a 45-yard touchdown against Southeast Missouri State University. He had 7 tackles, one interception and one fumble recovery against Marshall University. Mickens elected to return to school for his senior season, but suffered a left knee injury during a practice on November 20, 2008. He started 11 games at left cornerback, but missed the last 3 regular season games. He returned to play in the 2009 Orange Bowl, although he struggled in the contest. He finished the year with 70 tackles (second on the team), 2 tackles for loss, 10 passes defensed and 4 interceptions (tied for the team lead). He had 14 tackles and 3 passes defensed against the University of Akron. He had 11 tackles and on pass defensed against West Virginia University. He left as the school's career leader in interceptions (14) and interception return yards (296). He started 46 out of 47 games, while registering 233 tackles (8 for loss), 48 passes defensed, one sack, one forced fumble and 2 fumble recoveries. Professional careerDallas Cowboys= Mickens was considered a possible first round talent, but ended up being selected in the seventh round (227th overall) of the 2009 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys. He dropped because of concerns about the left knee injury he suffered in college, that caused him to run 4.53 at his Pro Day. He was waived on September 5, after showing a lack of speed and quickness. He was signed to the practice squad with the hope that he could return to his old form. =Tampa Bay Buccaneers= The Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed him from the Dallas Cowboys practice squad on November 2, 2009. He was declared inactive in three games, before being released on November 24. =Cincinnati Bengals= The Cincinnati Bengals signed him to their practice squad on November 30, 2009. He was released on April 15, 2010. =Calgary Stampeders= On May 27, 2010, Mickens signed with the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League. He was released on June 9 and decided to retire because of injury. Coaching career In 2011, he was a defensive assistant at the University of Cincinnati. In 2012, he was a defensive assistant at Indiana State University. In 2013, he became the cornerbacks coach at the University of Idaho. In 2014, he moved on to Bowling Green State University to be the cornerbacks coach. In 2014, he was named the cornerbacks coach at Bowling Green. In December 2017, it was announced that he was joining Kent State as the team's secondary coach. In January 2018, he was named the Cincinnati cornerbacks coach. In February 2020, he was hired as the cornerbacks' coach at the University of Notre Dame, reuniting with Brian Kelly, who has his head coach at the University of Cincinnati.

It stretches westward from Chicago Heights () to Joliet (), serving fast-growing suburbs such as Frankfort and New Lenox. Its history The Old Plank Road Trail occupies the western half of a plank road right-of-way acquired about 1850 and improved in 1855 into a railroad line, chartered as the Joliet and Northern Indiana Railroad. This nominally independent railroad line, which stretched from Joliet to Lake Station, Indiana, appears to have been affiliated with the Michigan Central Railroad from the start of its existence. Soon this section of roadbed was called the Joliet Cutoff and was operated by the Michigan Central as a spur line of its primary right-of-way from Indiana into downtown Chicago. In the early 1900s, railroad use of this roadbed began to decline. Trains were beginning to be partly replaced by rubber-tired vehicles that used new paved roads such as the Lincoln Highway (now U.S. Highway 30), which parallels the Old Plank Road Trail throughout its entire length. Service on this portion of the Joliet Cutoff ended in 1972. This abandonment opened the way for the railroad bed to be rededicated to public trail use. Starting in 1977, local residents organized to preserve the historic right-of-way for trail use. In 1982, the right-of-way was renamed the \\"Old Plank Road Trail.\\" The trail was officially opened to the public in July 1997. Several strips of land along the roadbed preserve remnants of the Chicago area's original tallgrass prairie, on ground that had never been plowed since the land was originally acquired for plank road purposes about 1850. The Old Plank Road Trail is currently operated by the Forest Preserve District of Will County and by various townships and municipalities with jurisdiction over the trail. The trail is served by numerous cross-streets adjacent to U.S. Highway 30, and by the Matteson stop on the Metra Electric north-south commuter train line.

It can also be referred as consortium or syndicated investment. Definition  In a club deal, the investor group of private equity firms pools its assets together and makes the acquisition collectively. The practice has allowed private equity to purchase larger and more expensive companies than each firm could acquire through its own private equity funds. By syndicating the equity ownership across a group of investment firms, each firm reduces its concentration and is able to maintain the diversification of its portfolio of investments. History In the US, syndicated investment began as early as 1870 with a Pennsylvania Railroad offering. In the 1920s several syndicates existed for the purchase and sale of securities. From 1984 to 2007, an average of 63% of US venture capital firm investments were syndicated according to a 2010 study, rising up to 77% in 2000. In the US, the years from 2000 to 2010 have been called “the conspiratorial era.” The years from 2003 until 2007 were also described as \\"the era of club deals\\", since the 2006 antitrust investigation of the Department of Justice prompted a decrease; though, the Department has not brought charges. In 2007, private plaintiffs filed a first class action law suit against 13 private equity firms for conspiring in club deals to keep buyout prices down, followed by two more in the ensuing years, which the court consolidated and scaled down against 11 equity firms. In June 2014, Bain Capital Partners, LLC and Goldman Sachs settled for a combined $121 million after more than six years of litigation. An unnamed Goldman executive was quoted as saying “club etiquette” had prevailed in the $17.6 billion takeover of Freescale Semiconductor. End of July Blackstone, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and TPG Capital settled for a combined $325 million, as published only in August. In September 2014 a judge will decide whether the plaintiffs can be considered a class whether to approve the settlements. The Carlyle group is the only hold out that has not settled yet. Financial characteristics and outcomes In a 2009 study of 198 leveraged buyouts in the US from 1984 to 2007, 29% were syndicated and \\"target shareholders receive[d] approximately 10% less of pre-bid firm equity value, or roughly 40% lower premiums, in club deals compared to sole-sponsored leveraged buyouts\\", the so-called club discount. However, the lower premiums disappeared with increasing percentage of institutional ownership in the target company, maybe because of institutional owners greater bargaining power for a higher price. On average, club deals were larger in transaction size than sole-sponsor buyouts, but fewer than 20 percent were larger than the largest sole-sponsor buyouts in the last four years. Premiums were lower in club deals announced prior to 2006 than since then. Club deals were no less risky as measured by return volatility and beta, than a sole-sponsor buyout. Even when controlling for size, risk and leverage ratios, club deals required more lenders than sole- sponsor buyouts. According to authors of the 2010 study, the prevalence of syndication suggested a diseconomy associated with venture capital firm scale. Criticism In 2006 the US Department of Justice, concerned with bid rigging, opened an investigation of private equity firms regarding their participation in consortiums in past sales. The 2009 study of US buyouts from 1984 to 2007 with 59 club deals concluded that \\"[...] private equity clubs constrain the supply of debt financing for competing bids by aggressively locking up debt financiers”. Institutional investors investing as limited partners in private equity funds criticize the practice of club deals that results in holdings in the same investment through different funds. Large limited partners have preferred to support large leveraged buyouts through equity co-investments alongside the leading financial sponsor.Limited partnership co-investment or GP club deals?.

It was from these airports and airfields in Australia, that the Fifth Air Force was able to regroup, re-equip and begin offensive operations against the Empire of Japan after the disasters in the Philippines and Dutch East Indies during 1942. Overview Following the Japanese conquest of the Philippines, the remnants of the USAAF Far East Air Force relocated southwest to bases in the Dutch East Indies (Indonesia). United States Army Air Force units in Australia, including the Fifth Air Force, were eventually reinforced and re-organized following their initial defeats in the Philippines and the East Indies. After those islands also fell to Japanese forces early in 1942, FEAF headquarters moved to Australia and was reorganized and redesignated the Fifth Air Force on 5 February 1942 under General George Brett in Melbourne. On paper, Brett had several hundred military aircraft of all types, but only a few of them were operational,American Caesar, Wm. Manchester, 1978, Little Brown Company, pp.300–307: On and about July–Dec 1942 and Kenney's impact on MacArthur and the war, his support for Guadalcanal and his daring offensive gamble in going to meet the Japanese in the difficult jungles of New Guinea in defense of Australia, rather than risk a war of maneuver when he had insufficient forces to move around. although replacements were in the logistics pipeline inbound on freighters Headquarters, Fifth Air Force, was re-staffed at Brisbane, Australia on 18 September 1942 and the Fifth Air Force was placed under the command of 52-year-old Major General George Kenney on Tuesday, 28 July and Kenney had an immediate impact. Within a month, he had his command striving for, or at least seriously thinking about, seizing air superiority over New Guinea and parity over the Solomon Sea, and September saw the Fifth placing several dozen bombers over New Britain and Rabaul, whereas in July only mere handfuls could be fielded. By the end of August, before the retreat began of the Japanese attacking over the Owen Stanley Ranges, he'd established five airfields at Port Moresby, more than necessary for its defense, but a good start for staging to forward bases. General Kenney encouraged MacArthur to conduct a forward defense and meet the Japanese along the choke-points among the jungles of New Guinea, and provided planning for airlifts to put the ground forces in forward positions and supply them by air- transport if necessary. This model would be utilized throughout the coming two years of offensives as MacArthur's ground forces conducted Leapfrogging maneuvers and used combined arms tactics while strategically bypassing Japanese strong points and forcing them to attack his defensive works as he placed forces astride their supply lines. The Fifth Air Force kept pace, moving from forward air base to forward air base, repressing daylight activity by the Japanese on Land, Sea and Air. When he first proposed air supply (since sea-lanes were not safe because of the position of the Japanese bases in the Solomon Sea) to an objection that his C-47 airlift units could not move trucks as well as men and materials, Kenney immediately responded that they could, by cutting the truck frames in half with torches and welding them together again in Papua. By November the Fifth was in forward Headquarters in Port Moresby, though the official HQ remained in Brisbane. In addition to the Air Force units, many United States Army forces embarked in Australia, using it as a base of operations prior to their deployment to New Guinea in 1942, and other islands in the Southwest Pacific, driving the Japanese forces north towards their home islands. As the ground forces moved forward, the tactical air units of the AAF moved with them, providing the necessary air support for the ground operations. Throughout the Pacific War, Australia remained an important base of operations, but with the advance of the Allied Armies, the air-bases in Australia were returned to the Royal Australian Air Force once the Allied forces deployed north during 1942 and 1943. Today, most of the airfields in the Northern Territory have returned to their natural state, being abandoned after the war, but most of the airfields in Queensland and the other Australian states and territories still exist as civilian airports or military bases. Later, during the Cold War, the United States Air Force assigned a small number of personnel to Australia for communication duties and logistical support. Today, USAF units routinely visit Australia for joint exercises with the Australian Defence Force, with a few personnel assigned for military liaison duties. Major units The initial USAAF units assigned to Australia in late 1941 and 1942 were ones which had withdrawn from the Philippines, leaving their ground echelons in Bataan as part of the 5th Interceptor Command to fight as infantry units. Later in 1942 and 1943, additional units arrived from the United States as replacement and argumentation to the Fifth Air Force for offensive operations. Known units assigned were: * Bombardment : 3d Bombardment Group (25 February 1942 – 28 January 1943) :: (A-20 Havoc, A-24 Dauntless, B-25 Mitchell) : 7th Bombardment Group (22 December 1941 – 4 February 1942) :: (B-17 Flying Fortress) : 19th Bombardment Group (24 December 1941 – 2 December 1942) :: (B-17 Flying Fortress) : 22d Bombardment Group (1 March 1942 – 9 October 1943) :: (B-26 Marauder) : 27th Bombardment Group (February–4 May 1943) :: (A-24 Dauntless) : 38th Bombardment Group (25 February – October 1942) :: (B-25 Mitchell) : 43d Bombardment Group (28 March – 14 September 1942) :: (B-17 Flying Fortress) : 90th Bombardment Group (November 1942 – 10 February 1943) :: (B-24 Liberator) : 380th Bombardment Group (May 1943 – 20 February 1945) :: (B-24 Liberator) * Fighter : 8th Fighter Group (6 March 1942 – 16 May 1943) :: (P-39 Airacobra, P-38 Lightning) : 35th Fighter Group (4 May – 22 July 1942) :: (P-39 Airacobra, P-38 Lightning) : 49th Fighter Group (2 February – 9 October 1942) :: (Curtiss P-40) : 58th Fighter Group (19 November – 28 December 1943) :: (P-47 Thunderbolt) * Other : 6th Reconnaissance Group (10 October – 10 December 1943 : 317th Troop Carrier Group (23 January – 30 September 1943) : 374th Troop Carrier Group (12 November 1942 – 1 September 1944) : 60th Air Depot Group : 1124th Military Police (1943 - 1945) Major aircraft operated A-20 aircraft of the 3rd Bomb Group, 89th Bomb Squadron Unidentified 1941 serial Douglas A-24-DE Dauntless Dive Bomber, ex 27th Bombardment Group (Light), reassigned to the 8th Squadron of the 3rd Bomb Group, Charters Towers Airfield, Queensland, Australia, 1942.

P-40E of the 7th Fighter Squadron – 49th Fighter Group – Australia – March 1942 * A-20 Havoc. A-20s first arrived in Australia by way of the air echelon of the 3rd Bombardment Group (Light) and the first operational unit to fly the A-20 in actual battle was the 89th Bombardment Squadron of the 3rd Bombardment Group. Many A-20s were reassigned to the RAAF, being known as Bostons by the RAAF and had varied origins, some being ex-USAAF machines, some being acquired from the Netherlands Marine Luchtvaartdenst, and others being diverted from British contracts. These planes served with just one RAAF squadron, No. 22 Squadron which saw a lot of action in the Dutch East Indies.Mesko, Jim (1994), A-20 Havoc in Action, Aircraft Number 144, Squadron/Signal PublicationsWilson, Stewart (1992),Boston, Mitchell and Liberator in Australian Service, Aerospace Publications * A-24 Dauntless. The first operational A-24 unit was the 27th Bombardment Group (Light). Three of the four squadrons of the 27th BG were equipped with the A-24, plus one squadron of the 3rd Bombardment Group. The remaining squadrons of these groups were equipped with A-20A twin-engined level bombers. The crews of the 27th BG were in the Philippines when war broke out in the Pacific but their aircraft were in-transit via ship from Hawaii. The shipment was diverted to Brisbane, where they arrived on 22 December. Some of the 27th BG pilots were sent from the Philippines to ferry their aircraft back from Australia but were unable to do so when gun motors and solenoids could not be found during assembly. From Brisbane, eleven A-24s flew up to Java in February 1942, but this battle was already lost. The remainder began operations from Port Moresby, New Guinea with the 8th Bombardment Squadron on 1 April 1942. These units suffered heavy losses in the face of the Japanese advance. After five of seven A-24s were lost on their last mission, the A-24s were withdrawn from action as being too slow, too short-ranged, and too poorly armed. However, in all fairness to the A-24, their pilots had not been trained in dive-bombing operations and they often had to operate without adequate fighter escort. Following the New Guinea debacle, the A-24s were withdrawn from combat and the 27th was returned to the United States, where after being re-equipped with A-20s was sent to North Africa as part of Twelfth Air Force. * B-17 Flying Fortress. After the mission to attack a Japanese amphibious operation at Legaspi on 14 December 1941, only 14 B-17s remained of the original 35 assigned to the Philippines on 8 December. All were stationed at Del Monte Field on Mindanao, with the aircraft needing depot maintenance. Beginning on 17 December, the B-17s began to be evacuated to Batchelor Airfield near Darwin. These first B-17s in Australia were shark-tailed C and D models. The first B-17 mission out of Australia, an attack on Japanese shipping at Davao, took place on 22 December with nine \\"Flying Forts\\" taking part. They landed at Del Monte, which remained in American hands until April 1942. However, the small force of B-17s could do very little to stem the tide of the Japanese advance, launching valiant but futile attacks against the masses of Japanese shipping. Newer large-tailed B-17Es began to join the depleted force of earlier-model B-17s in the Pacific in mid-1942, with the tail gunner of the B-17E being unpleasant surprise for the Japanese, who had become accustomed to attacking the Fortress from the rear. The crews of pre-B-17E Fortresses often adopted the expediency of rigging sticks in the rear of their planes, hoping to convince the Japanese attackers that tail guns were actually fitted to these planes as well. However, by mid-1943, most Fortresses had been withdrawn from the Pacific in favor of the longer-ranged B-24 Liberator. The B-24 was better suited for operations in the Pacific, having a higher speed and a larger bombload at medium altitudes. In addition, the losses of Eighth Air Force in Europe were reaching such magnitudes that the entire B-17 production was urgently needed for replacements and training in that theatre. Shortly after the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, it was decided that no more B-17s would be sent to Australia. * B-24 Liberator. Fifteen USAAF LB-30 (B-24A) bombers were deployed in Java in early 1942 to reinforce the B-17-equipped 19th Bombardment Group in a vain attempt to stem the Japanese advance. The Java-based LB-30s would be the first US-flown Liberators to see action and participated in numerous attacks against Japanese targets in the Sulawesi, in Sumatra, and against shipping during the Japanese invasion of Bali. By late February, the position of Allied forces in Java had become untenable, and the surviving LB-30s were evacuated to Australia. The early LB-30s were replaced by the first B-24Ds to reach the Pacific in late 1942. By 1943, the Liberator had almost entirely replaced the B-17 Fortress as the primary long-range heavy bomber in the theatre. The B-24 became the most numerous USAAF heavy bomber based in Australia and New Guinea in the most desperate phase of the Pacific war, and it was the first four-engine heavy bomber to serve with the Royal Australian Air Force home squadrons. It reigned supreme in the Pacific until the arrival of the B-29 Superfortress in mid-1944.Freeman, Roger A. (1969), The Consolidated B-24J Liberator, Profile Publications * B-26 Marauder/B-25 Mitchell. In February 1942, the 22d Bombardment Group was ordered to Australia, being assigned to bases around Townsville. The B-26 first entered combat on 5 April 1942, when the 22nd Group took off from their bases in Queensland, refuelled at Port Moresby, and then attacked Japanese facilities at Rabaul. Each B-26 had a 250-gallon bomb bay and carried a 2000– pound bombload. The Marauder was the only medium bomber available in the Pacific, and generally, no fighter escort was available leaving the Marauders were on their own if they encountered enemy fighters. There were two groups equipped with B-26s, the 22nd and 38th, with two squadrons of the 38th Bombardment Group (69th and 70th) equipped with B-26s. In this series of attacks on Japanese-held facilities in the Dutch East Indies, the B-26s gained a reputation for speed and ruggedness against strong opposition from Japanese Zero fighters. Attacks on Rabaul ended on 24 May, after 80 sorties had flown. A series of unescorted raids were made on Japanese installations in the Lae area. These raids were vigorously opposed by Zero fighters. In the 84 sorties flown against Lae between 24 April and 4 July 1942, three Marauders were lost. As the Allies pushed northward in the South Pacific, temporary airfields had to be cut out of the jungle and these runways were generally fairly short. The North American B-25 Mitchell had a shorter takeoff run than the B-26, and it began to take over the medium bomber duties. Although it was admitted that the B-26 could take greater punishment, was defensively superior, and could fly faster with a heavier bomb load, the B-25 had better short-field characteristics, good sortie rate, and minimal maintenance requirements. In addition, the B-25 was considerably easier to manufacture and had suffered from fewer developmental problems. At this time, there were more B-25s available for South Pacific duty because it had been decided to send the B-26 Marauder to the Mediterranean theatre. Consequently, it was decided to adopt the B-25 as the standard medium bomber for the entire Pacific theatre, and to use the B-26 exclusively to Twelfth Air Force in the Mediterranean with some later being used by Ninth Air Force in the European theatres. * P-38 Lightning. The first P-38s to reach Australia during 1942 were P-38Fs assigned to the 39th Fighter Squadron of the 35th Fighter Group. This unit traded in its Bell P-39 Airacobras for the Lightnings at RAAF Base Amberley in Queensland before returning to combat operations at Port Moresby in New Guinea. Its first success took place on 27 December 1942 when its pilots claimed eleven kills for the loss of only one P-38F. Two of these kills were claimed by Richard I. Bong, who was to go on to claim a total of 40 kills, all of them while flying the Lightning. The Lightning was ideally suited for the Pacific theatre. It possessed a performance markedly superior to that of its Japanese opponents. It possessed a range significantly better than that of the P-39s, P-40s and P-47s available in 1942 in the Southwest Pacific, and its twin engines offered an additional safety factor when operating over long stretches of water and jungle. However, the limited number of Lightnings available during late 1942 and early 1943 had to be used to make up attrition in the 39th Fighter Squadron and to equip only a single squadron in each of the 8th and 49th Fighter Groups.Jeffrey L. Ethell, Joe Christy, 1978, P-38 Lightning at War * P-39 Airacobra. At the time of Pearl Harbor, the P-39 (along with the P-40 and a few P-38s) was virtually the only modern fighter available to the USAAF. Those P-39s already in service with the USAAF at the time of Pearl Harbor were deployed at home bases, but were quickly moved forward to overseas bases in the Pacific to try to stem the Japanese advance. They carried much of the load in the initial Allied efforts in 1942. However, many Allied pilots lacked adequate training, and equipment and maintenance of the planes were below average. The Airacobras operating from Australia were sometimes called upon to serve as interceptors, a role for which they were totally unsuited. They proved to be no match for the Japanese Zero in air-to-air combat and were withdrawn from combat by the end of 1942.McDowell, Ernie, 1989, P-39 Airacobra at War * Curtiss P-40. During 1941, a substantial number of P-40Bs and Cs were shipped to USAAF bases overseas, including the 20th Pursuit Squadron of the 24th Pursuit Group at Clark Field in the Philippines. Almost all were destroyed in the Battle of the Philippines (1941–42), and only a few reached Australia, although the RAAF operated a large number of P-40E-1 export models (Kittyhawk IA) and P-40Ks (Kittyhawk III) from the United States.Ethell, Jerry, 1982, Warbirds, American Legends of World War II * P-47 Thunderbolt. The first P-47Ds to arrive in the Pacific theatre entered service with the 348th Fighter Group in June 1943. They were initially operated out of Queensland and were used on long-range missions to strike at Japanese targets in New Guinea. The 348th was followed by the 35th Group and at the beginning of 1944 by the 58th Group as well as the 35th Squadron of the 8th Group and the 9th FS of the 49th Group. However the Thunderbolt was used primarily by Seventh and Thirteenth Air Forces in the Central Pacific, with the long-range P-47N arriving in June 1944.Scotts, Jerry, 1995, P-47 Thunderbolt, The Operational Record Airfields and unit assignments In cooperation with the Royal Australian Air Force, (RAAF), the Fifth Air Force was able to use many existing Australian airports and airfields to carry on the war effort. In 1942, additional new military airfields were constructed by Australian and United States engineering units to accommodate the increasing number of USAAF groups and personnel being deployed. The Air Force groups and squadrons moved frequently from airfield to airfield, and often group headquarters was located away from the operational squadrons, as the squadrons were dispersed over several airfields for defensive purposes. Known airfields of the Fifth Air Force units and squadron assignments are as follows: Note: Airfield locations shown on map above AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY * RAAF Base Fairbairn, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory : :: 8th Fighter Squadron (49th Fighter Group) (16 February – 17 April 1942) NORTHERN TERRITORY * Batchelor Airfield, Batchelor, Northern Territory : : 19th Bombardment Group (Heavy), (24–30 December 1941) (First B-17s arrived on 17 December 1941) : 27th Bombardment Group (Light), (March–4 May 1942) :: 16th Bombardment Squadron (Light) (17 February – 8 March 1942) :: 17th Bombardment Squadron (Light) (22 February – 8 March 1942) : 7th Fighter Squadron, 49th Fighter Group, (9 April – 18 September 1942) : 14th Bombardment Squadron (Heavy), 7th Bombardment Group (Heavy) attached to 19th Bombardment Group (Heavy) (24 December 1941 – 30 December 1941) (Air echelon only.

to fly passengers and cargo to US bases in Australia, the Admiralties and the Philippines. * Six of the 7th Bombardment Group 's B-17 Flying Fortresses left Hamilton Field, California on 6 December 1941, reaching Hickam Field, Hawaii during the Japanese attack but were able to land safely. Later in December the remainder of the air echelon flew B-17's from the United Staates to Java, with the unit establishing its headquarters in Australia. From 14 January to 4 March 1942, during the Japanese drive through the Philippines and Netherlands East Indies, the group operated from Java, being awarded a Distinguished Unit Citation for its action against enemy aircraft, ground installations, warships, and transports. * On 7 December 1941 (8 December in the Philippines), when the Japanese first attacked Clark Field, the 19th Bombardment Group suffered numerous casualties and lost many planes. Late in December the air echelon moved to Australia to transport medical and other supplies to the Philippine Islands and evacuate personnel from that area. The men in Australia moved to Java at the end of 1941 and, flying B-17 Flying Fortress, LB-30, and B-24 Liberator aircraft, earned a Distinguished Unit Citation for the group by attacking enemy aircraft, ground installations, warships, and transports during the Japanese drive through the Philippines and Netherlands Indies early in 1942. The men returned to Australia from Java early in March 1942, and later that month the group evacuated Gen Douglas MacArthur, his family, and key members of his staff from the Philippines to Australia. After a brief rest the group resumed combat operations, participating in the Battle of the Coral Sea and raiding Japanese transportation, communications, and ground forces during the enemy's invasion of Papua New Guinea. From 7 to 12 August 1942 the 19th bombed airdromes, ground installations, and shipping near Rabaul, New Britain, being awarded another DUC for these missions. Captain Harl Pease, Jr. was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during 6–7 August 1942: when one engine of his bomber failed during a mission over New Britain, Captain Pease returned to Australia to obtain another plane; unable to find one fit for combat, he selected the most serviceable plane at the base and rejoined his squadron for an attack on a Japanese airdrome near Rabaul. By skillful flying he maintained his position in the formation and withstood enemy attacks until his bombs had been released on the objective; in the air battle that continued after the bombers left the target, Captain Pease's aircraft fell behind the formation and was lost. The group returned to the US late in 1942. * The 24th Pursuit Group was wiped out on Luzon in the spring of 1942 during the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. Some pilots escaped to Australia where they were assigned to other units. The unit was never remanned or reequipped, but remained on active status until 2 April 1946 Post World War II In 1978, Australia and the United States established a Joint Geological and Geographical Research Station (JGGRS) in Alice Springs.\\"Exchange of Notes constituting an Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America to amend the Agreement regarding the Management and Operation of the Joint Geological and Geophysical Research Station at Alice Springs of 28 February 1978.

Hip hop website AllHipHop.com named Rebel Diaz one of the top fifty emerging/underground hip hop artists of 2013. History and activism The children of Chilean activists, RodStarz and G1 were born in England and grew up in Chicago's North Side, and former member Lah Tere was raised in Humboldt Park, Chicago. Rebel Diaz identify with and position themselves within a history of political resistance through music, specifically citing the Nueva canción movement.

Generally, the securities are to be listed on a stock exchange. In most jurisdictions, a public offering requires the issuing company to publish a prospectus detailing the terms and rights attached to the offered security, as well as information on the company itself and its finances. Many other regulatory requirements surround any public offering and they vary according to jurisdiction. The services of an underwriter are often used to conduct a public offering.  Stock offering  Initial public offering (IPO) is one type of public offering. Not all public offerings are IPOs. An IPO occurs only when a company offers its shares (not other securities) for the first time for public ownership and trading, an act making it a public company. However, public offerings are also made by already-listed companies. The company issues additional securities to the public, adding to those currently being traded. For example, a listed company with 8 million shares outstanding can offer to the public another 2 million shares. This is a public offering but not an IPO. Once the transaction is complete, the company will have 10 million shares outstanding. Non-initial public offering of equity is also called seasoned equity offering. A shelf prospectus is often used by companies in exactly that situation. Instead of drafting one before each public offering, the company can file a single prospectus detailing the terms of many different securities it might offer in the next several years. Shortly before the offering (if any) actually takes place, the company informs the public of material changes in its finances and outlook since the publication of the shelf prospectus.  Other security types  Other types of securities, besides shares, can be offered publicly. Bonds, warrants, capital notes and many other kinds of debt and equity vehicles are offered, issued and traded in public capital markets. A private company, with no shares listed publicly, can still issue other securities to the public and have them traded on an exchange. A public company may also offer and list other securities alongside its shares.  Primary and secondary offering  Most public offerings are in the primary market, that is, the issuing company itself is the offerer of securities to the public. The offered securities are then issued (allocated, allotted) to the new owners. If it is an offering of shares, this means that the company's outstanding capital grows. If it is an offering of other securities, this entails the creation or expansion of a series (of bonds, warrants, etc.). However, more rarely, public offerings take place in the secondary market. This is called a secondary market offering: existing security holders offer to sell their stake to other, new owners, through the stock exchange. The offerer is different from the issuer (the company). A secondary market offering is still a public offering with much the same requirements, including a prospectus.

Markopolos (born October 22, 1956) is an American former securities industry executive and a forensic accounting and financial fraud investigator. From 1999 to 2008, Markopolos uncovered evidence that suggested that Bernie Madoff's wealth management business was a huge Ponzi scheme. In 2000, 2001, and 2005, Markopolos alerted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of his views, supplying supporting documents, but each time the SEC ignored him or gave his evidence only a cursory investigation. Madoff was finally revealed to be a fraud in December 2008, when his sons contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation. After admitting to operating the largest private Ponzi scheme in history, Madoff was sentenced in 2009 to 150 years in prison. In 2010, Markopolos' book on uncovering the Madoff fraud, No One Would Listen: A True Financial Thriller, was published. Markopolos has criticized the SEC for failing to discover the Madoff fraud despite repeated tips, and for failing to investigate properly the larger companies it supervised. He described the private moments he had with victims of the Madoff fraud as: \\"Heartfelt, gut-wrenching things. People trying to commit suicide or losing loved ones who've died of heartbreak.\\" Critics of Markopolos have called him obsessive, a self-publicist, and self-righteous, and some questioned whether he was motivated by a financial bounty, which he denied.The man who blew the whistle on Bernard Madoff  Business  The GuardianHarry Markopolos Considered 'Taking Out' Bernie Madoff The Wall Street Journal described him as \\"a little bit nuts\\". In his book, he revealed that at one point he kept an old army gas mask handy in case SEC investigators burst into his home with teargas. He wrote in his book: \\"If [Madoff] contacted me and threatened me, I was going to go down to New York and take him out. At that point, it would have come down to him or me, [and] I felt I had no other options: I was going to kill him.\\"Whistleblower says he was prepared to murder Bernard Madoff – Boston Herald  Education and career  Markopolos attended Roman Catholic schools, graduating from Cathedral Preparatory School in Erie, Pennsylvania, in 1974. He received an undergraduate degree in Business Administration from Loyola College in Maryland in 1981, and a Master of Science in Finance from Boston College in 1997, also Catholic schools. He is a CFA charterholder, and a Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE). He began his career on Wall Street in 1987 as a broker with Makefield Securities, a small Erie-based brokerage.https://pennsylvaniadb.com/company/809330/makefield-securities- corporation During 1988, he obtained a job with Darien Capital Management in Darien, Connecticut, as an assistant portfolio manager. From 1991 to 2004, he served as a portfolio manager at Boston-based options trading company Rampart Investment Management, ultimately becoming its chief investment officer. He now works as a forensic accounting analyst for attorneys who sue companies under the False Claims Act and other laws, emphasizing tips that result in continuing investigations into medical billing, Internal Revenue Service, and United States Department of Defense frauds, in which a \\"whistleblower\\" would be compensated.  Madoff investigation  Bernard \\"Bernie\\" Madoff During 1999, Markopolos learned that one of Rampart's frequent trading partners, Access International Advisors, was dealing with a hedge fund manager who consistently delivered net returns of 1% to 2% a month. Frank Casey, one of Rampart's principals, met with Access CEO René-Thierry Magon de La Villehuchet, and learned the manager was Bernie Madoff, who was operating a wealth management business in which his clients essentially gave him carte blanche to invest the money as he saw fit, in a set of securities. Casey and Rampart's managing partner, Dave Fraley, asked Markopolos to try to design a product similar to Madoff's split-strike conversion, in hopes of luring away Access from investing in Madoff. When Markopolos obtained a copy of Madoff's revenue stream, he spotted problems. The biggest red flag, he believed, was that the return stream rose steadily with only a few downticks — represented graphically by a nearly perfect 45-degree angle. According to Markopolos, anyone who understood the underlying math of the markets would have known that such a return stream \\"simply doesn't exist in finance,\\" since the markets were too volatile even in the most favorable conditions for this to be possible. Based on this and other factors, Markopolos eventually concluded that Madoff could not mathematically deliver his purported returns using the strategies he claimed to use. As he saw it, there were only two ways to explain the figures: Madoff was either running a Ponzi scheme (by paying established clients with newer clients' money) or front running (buying stock for his own and the hedge fund's accounts, based on insider knowledge about market impacts from about- to-be-executed client orders at his company's unrelated broker-dealer business). Markopolos later said that he knew within five minutes that Madoff's numbers didn't add up. He claimed it took him another four hours to uncover enough evidence that he could mathematically prove that they could have been obtained only by fraud. Despite this, Markopolos' bosses at Rampart asked Markopolos to deconstruct Madoff's strategy to see if he could replicate it. He could not simulate Madoff's returns, using information he had gathered about Madoff's trades in stocks and options. For instance, he discovered that for Madoff's strategy to work, he would have had to buy more options on the Chicago Board Options Exchange than actually existed. His calculations of Madoff's trades revealed that there was almost no correlation between Madoff's stocks and the S&P; 100, as Madoff claimed. Markopolos also could find no evidence that the market was responding to any Madoff trades, even though by his estimate Madoff was managing as much as $6 billion, three times more than any known hedge fund at the time. Given that Madoff's supposed trades should have had a substantial ripple effect on broader markets, Markopolos suspected that Madoff wasn't even trading. With the help of two of his colleagues at Rampart, Casey and fellow quant Neil Chelo, Markopolos continued to probe the Madoff operation. What they found concerned him enough that he filed a formal complaint with the Boston office of the SEC during the spring of 2000. However, the SEC took no action. Nonetheless, others in the investing world took Markopolos' findings seriously. In 2000, Joel Tillinghast of Fidelity Investments dropped his plans to study Madoff's strategies after a meeting with Markopolos. Tillinghast wrote years later that his discussion with Markopolos convinced him that Madoff was almost certainly engaging in fraud; as he put it, \\"nothing in Madoff's ostensible strategy made sense.\\"Joel Tillinghast (2017). Big Money Thinks Small: Biases, Blind Spots and Smarter Investing. Columbia Business School Publishing, p. 123-124 Michael Ocrant, editor-in-chief of MARHedge, joined the effort to publicize Madoff's questionable actions. Casey surprised Ocrant with information that Madoff, whom Ocrant only knew to be one of the largest market makers on NASDAQ and one of the largest brokers on the New York Stock Exchange, actually ran a secretive multi-billion dollar hedge fund, directly managing investors' money. Ocrant investigated and wrote an article, \\"Madoff tops charts; skeptics ask how\\", published May 1, 2001, questioning Madoff's returns. Within a week, Erin Arvedlund followed with an investigative article in Barron's, further questioning Madoff's secrecy and results; despite the details in these scathing articles, they generated no action from the SEC, and did not scare off Madoff's existing investors. Markopolos sent a more detailed submission to the SEC a year later. He also offered to let the SEC send him to Madoff's headquarters undercover, obtain the trading tickets, and compare them with the Options Price Reporting Authority tape. By then, Markopolos was convinced that Madoff was not really trading. He believed that his trading tickets would not match the OPRA tape, which would have been hard proof that Madoff was a fraud. This submission also passed without action from the SEC. From the beginning, Markopolos believed that Madoff was most likely running a Ponzi scheme, given his voracious appetite for cash; a Ponzi scheme can last only as long as new money is flowing in to pay existing investors. His colleagues, Casey and Chelo, were more inclined to think that Madoff was front-running. Casey and Chelo believed Madoff was already a very wealthy man, and on paper it made no sense for him essentially to steal billions of dollars that he didn't need. They suspected that it was more feasible for him to increase his returns on actual trades via front-running. Markopolos, however, doubted this, since front-runners don't need the massive amount of new investor money that Madoff kept bringing in. Additionally, Markopolos believed that if Madoff was front- running, he would have to siphon off money from his broker-dealer arm to pay the investors in his hedge fund. This would have resulted in the customers of his broker-dealer operation getting shortchanged -- something that would not have gone unnoticed by Madoff's more sophisticated broker-dealer customers. Soon after his second submission, Markopolos traveled to Europe with Magon de La Villehuchet to help get investors for an alternative product to Madoff that he'd developed for Rampart. While in Europe, Markopolos found that 14 different funds, at various firms, were invested with Madoff. Each manager believed that his fund was the only one from which Madoff was taking new money, a classic \\"robbing Peter to pay Paul\\" scenario. When Markopolos heard this, he was convinced that Madoff's wealth-management business was a Ponzi scheme. Markopolos persevered, even though he felt that it created a considerable risk to his own safety. He learned during his European tour that a large number of funds invested with Madoff operated offshore. To his mind, this was evidence that the Russian mafia and Latin-American drug cartels were invested with Madoff, and might want to silence anyone who threatened the viability of the hedge funds. On December 17, 2002, Markopolos came up with a plan to deliver an investigative file anonymously to an aide of then-Attorney General of New York Eliot Spitzer as Spitzer delivered a speech at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston. He put on a pair of white gloves to prevent leaving fingerprints, and wore an oversize coat. Even after leaving Rampart in 2004, frustrated that he was in a business that had to compete with cheats and lawbreakers, Markopolos continued to be driven by the intellectual challenge of solving the problem, and the ongoing encouragement from Boston SEC staffer Ed Manion. The culmination of Markopolos' analysis was a 21-page memo sent during November 2005 to SEC regulators, entitled \\"The World's Largest Hedge Fund is a Fraud\\". It outlined his suspicions in more detail and invited officials to check his theories. He outlined 30 red flags that he believed proved Madoff's returns could not be legitimate. His analysis was based on more than 14 years of Madoff return numbers, during which time Madoff reported only four losing months, an implausible scenario that Markopolos said could be achieved only by fraud. In the document Markopolos states: Although Madoff's scheme did not collapse until 2008, Markopolos believed that Madoff was on the brink of insolvency as early as the summer of 2005, when Casey found out that at least two banks were no longer lending money to their clients to invest with Madoff. This prompted Madoff to seek loans from banks. In June 2008 — six months before Madoff's scheme imploded — Markopolos' team uncovered evidence that Madoff was accepting leveraged money. In his book, Markopolos wrote that this was a sign Madoff was running out of cash and needed to increase his intake of new funds to keep the scheme going. On June 3, 2009, Markopolos told a conference at Boston College, his alma mater, that he believed Madoff personally kept less than 1 percent of the $65 billion reported stolen, and would probably lose what remained of his portion to money launderers. Markopolos estimated that $35 billion to $55 billion of the money Madoff claimed to have stolen never really existed, but were simply fictional profits he reported to his clients. Markopolos believed that Madoff's customers lost $10 billion to $35 billion, most of which went to early investors. \\"Madoff will wind up in a special prison designed as much to keep the crook's victims out as Madoff in. He's a guy who can't afford not to be in prison,\\" he said. Thierry Magon de La Villehuchet committed suicide soon after Madoff's scheme collapsed, having lost $1.5 billion. = Congressional testimony = On February 4, 2009, Markopolos testified before the United States Congress' House Financial Services Committee's capital markets panel and on March 1, appeared on CBS's 60 Minutes. Markopolos harshly criticized the SEC for ignoring his warnings about Madoff. \\"Nothing was done. There was an abject failure by the regulatory agencies we entrust as our watchdog,\\" he said in 65 pages of prepared testimony. He said that his original 2000 complaint gave the SEC enough evidence to stop Madoff when he was supposedly managing as little as $3 billion. Describing Madoff as \\"one of the most powerful men on Wall Street,\\" Markopolos stated that there was \\"great danger\\" in investigating him: \\"My team and I surmised that if Mr. Madoff gained knowledge of our activities, he may feel threatened enough to seek to stifle us.\\" He testified that he feared for his, as well as his family's safety, until after Madoff's arrest, when the SEC finally acknowledged that it had received \\"credible evidence\\" of Madoff's Ponzi scheme years before. He said that Madoff's \\"math never made sense,\\" that his \\"return stream never resembled any known financial instrument or strategy,\\" and that Madoff wasn't making the volumes of trades he claimed. According to Markopolos, the best warning about Madoff came during his initial analysis of 87 months (a little more than seven years) of Madoff trades. During that time, Madoff reported only three losing months. By comparison, the S&P; 500 Index reported 28 losing months during the same period. He likened Madoff's purported returns to a baseball player batting .966 for the season and \\"no one suspecting a cheat\\". Markopolos had originally concealed his identity from SEC regulators during May 1999, although he did meet face-to- face with SEC officials in Boston during 2000 and 2001. After the SEC did not respond, Markopolos was fearful of taking his complaints to the industry's self-regulatory authority, the National Association of Securities Dealers (since succeeded by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)). He not only feared the power Madoff's brother, Peter, had in that organization (he is a former Vice Chairman), but also feared that Madoff might have had associations with Russian and South American organized crime. Markopolos believed the FBI would reject his allegations without the SEC staff's endorsement. He believed that only a few SEC officials, including Manion and SEC Boston branch chief Mike Garrity, understood Madoff's operation well enough to detect the fraud. Markopolos met with Garrity during 2005, and said that while Garrity realized almost immediately that Madoff was violating the law, he could not take any action because Madoff was not based in New England. Markopolos later wrote that a few days after that meeting, Garrity called him and said his preliminary investigation revealed serious irregularities in the Madoff operation, and that he would have had inspection teams \\"tearing the place apart\\" if Madoff had been based in New England. However, since the Boston office's jurisdiction extended only as far as Greenwich, Connecticut; Garrity had no choice but to pass it down to the New York office. \\"My experiences with other SEC officials proved to be a systemic disappointment and led me to conclude that the SEC securities lawyers, if only through their investigative ineptitude and financial illiteracy, colluded to maintain large frauds such as the one to which Madoff later confessed.\\" He also added that during 2005 it was Meaghan Cheung, the branch chief of the SEC's New York office, to whom he gave his 21-page report alleging that Madoff was paying old investors with money from fresh recruits. \\"Ms. Cheung never expressed even the slightest interest in asking me questions\\", Markopolos said, claiming she was too concerned with Markopolos mentioning the possibility of a reward and the fact that he was a competitor of Madoff. Cheung approved an internal memo during November 2007 to close an SEC investigation of Madoff without bringing any claim. Subsequently, she left the agency. He testified he gave details about the case during 2005 to John Wilke, an investigative reporter for The Wall Street Journal, but that it was never pursued. Markopolos testified he (anonymously) sent a package of documents concerning Madoff to former New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who had successfully prosecuted a number of securities fraud cases, but that Spitzer apparently did not act, either. Spitzer's family firm had invested in Madoff's business.https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2008/12/eliot_spitzer_lost_too.html \\"Government has coddled, accepted, and ignored white-collar crime for too long,\\" he testified. \\"It is time the nation woke up and realized that it's not the armed robbers or drug dealers who cause the most economic harm, it's the white collar criminals living in the most expensive homes who have the most impressive resumes who harm us the most. They steal our pensions, bankrupt our companies, and destroy thousands of jobs, ruining countless lives.\\" He testified to Rep. Gary Ackerman (D-NY) that he had never been compensated for his efforts. \\"I did it for our flag, for patriotism.\\" Markopolos presented recommendations to improve the SEC's operations, which included mandatory department standards: good ethics, full transparency, full disclosure, and fair dealing for all. The SEC must establish a unit to accept \\"whistleblower\\" tips, and move its activity closer to financial centers away from Washington, D.C. His testimony included a reference to another $1 billion Ponzi scheme, which he shared the next day with SEC Inspector General H. David Kotz, who gave the tips to SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro. He disclosed information regarding a dozen as-yet-unknown foreign Madoff feeder funds, \\"hiding in the weeds\\" in Europe, the victims of which likely included Russian mafia and drug cartels, \\"dirty money\\" investors. Markopolos remarked that European royal families had also lost assets. Because of concerns of improper conduct by Inspector General Kotz in the Madoff investigation, Inspector General David C. Williams of the United States Postal Service was brought in to conduct an independent outside review. The Williams Report questioned Kotz's work on the Madoff investigation, because Kotz was a \\"very good friend\\" with Markopolos. Investigators were not able to determine when Kotz and Markopolos became friends. A violation of the ethics rule would have taken place if the friendship had been concurrent with Kotz's investigation of Madoff. = Other statements = In his interview with Steve Kroft of 60 Minutes, Markopolos said the biggest warning he noticed during his initial 1999 analysis of Madoff was that he reported losing months only four percent of the time. To Markopolos' mind, no one could possibly be that good, given the volatility of the markets. \\"As we know, markets go up and down, and his only went up,\\" he said. Markopolos noted that during his tenure at Rampart, he traded with some of the biggest derivatives companies in the world, and none of them dealt with Madoff, because they didn't think his numbers were real. He admitted that he had some financial incentive to eliminate Madoff, as the two competed against each other from 2000 to 2004. However, he said, he felt compelled to pursue it, because \\"when someone's competing on your playing field, who's a dirty player, you want him tossed off the field.\\" He assailed the SEC once again for ignoring his warnings, saying that the only reason Madoff was caught was that he ultimately collapsed under the weight of his own lies. Markopolos expanded on his criticism of the SEC in No One Would Listen. He claimed that SEC regulators don't have nearly enough expertise to understand the various products offered in the modern market; as he put it, the SEC was still \\"panning by hand\\". He also believed that the SEC's enforcement staff didn't take his complaints seriously, because they were expecting legal proof Madoff was a fraud, not the mathematical evidence he provided. To his mind, the investigators didn't understand that mathematical proof was stronger evidence than legal proof, because \\"with a math problem, there is only one correct answer.\\" As a result of the Madoff scandal, the SEC's chairman Christopher Cox stated that an investigation will delve into \\"all staff contact and relationships with the Madoff family and firm, and their impact, if any, on decisions by staff regarding the firm.\\" A now-former SEC compliance officer, Eric Swanson, married Madoff's niece Shana Madoff, a Madoff company compliance attorney.  2019 General Electric fraud allegation  In 2019, Markopolos published a report alleging fraudulent accounting within General Electric. The report caused the company's stock to drop 10.3% on August 15, 2019. The stock closed at $9.03 prior to the report, and then closed at $8.01 the following day when the report was published. Markopolos claimed GE was a fraud \\"bigger than Enron.\\" Subsequently, GE called the report \\"meritless\\" and an attempt at \\"market manipulation\\" by Markopolos; Wall Street analysts shrugged off the report; and the regulators called the report \\"fairly simplistic.\\" A Financial Times article labeled the report \\"some ill-thought out twaddle disguised as deep financial analysis.\\" The Markopolos website (www.gefraud.com) alleging this giant fraud disappeared after criticism about the quality of his analyses. The full report is still available, however, in internet archives. Three months after the 175 page Markopolos report, GE stock had risen almost 44% to close at $11.52 on November 15, handily outperforming the general stock market. But on May 15 GE closed at $5.49 per share, a 29-year low for the company.  Personal life  Markopolos is the eldest of three children of Georgia and Louis Markopolos, Greek-American restaurateurs. His father and two uncles once owned 12 Arthur Treacher's Fish and Chips restaurants in Maryland and Delaware. His younger brother, Louie, once managed the trading office for a New Jersey brokerage company. He has a sister, Melissa. He and his wife Faith, who works in the financial industry for an investment company conducting due diligence of portfolio managers, have three sons, two of which ⁠— Harry \\"Hare Bear\\" Markopolos and Louis \\"Big Lou\\" Markopolos ⁠— are twins.

During World War II, he worked on the German nuclear energy project, also known as the Uranium Club. He independently discovered the transuranic element neptunium. From 1947 to 1959, he taught and did research in Canada and the United States. From 1959 until he achieved emeritus status, he was at the German University of Marburg, where he established and became director of the Institute of Nuclear Chemistry. He was also the first dean of the Department of Physical Chemistry of the University of Marburg, which opened in 1971. Education From 1931 to 1936, Starke studied at the Friedrich-Wilhelms- Universität (today, the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin). He was awarded his doctorate there in 1937, under Otto Hahn.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Stark. Career From 1937, Starke was an assistant to Otto Hahn at the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Chemie (KWIC, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry; today, the Max Planck Institut für Chemie - Otto Hahn Institut), in Berlin-Dahlem. In 1940, scientists in both Germany and America were working on transuranic elements. Starke discovered the transuranic element neptunium (atomic number 93), independently from the American team of Edwin McMillan and Philip Abelson. The war and his move to Munich in 1941 delayed publication of his results until 1942.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Stark.In Memoriam Professor em. Dr. phil. Kurt Starke, Philipps-Universität Marburg 2000Walker, 1993, pp. 22-23 and 239n26. In 1941, Starke transferred to the Institut für physikalische Chemie under Klaus Clusius at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München. Shortly after the move, Starke was drafted into military service. It was only through the persistent efforts of Clusius that Starke granted a reprieve. Starke subsequently accepted a position to work with the German group at the Paris cyclotron, initially headed by Wolfgang Gentner, from Walther Bothe's Institut für Physik in Heidelberg. Under Clusius, Starke worked on the German nuclear energy project, also known as the Uranverein (Uranium Club). Starke worked on the enrichment of the uranium isotope U239, its decay products, and the production of heavy water. In 1943, Starke completed his Habilitation at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Stark.Walker, 1993, 42-44, 53, and 211.Kurt Starke Anreicherung des künstlich redioaktiven Uran-Isotops U239 und seines Folgeproduktes 93239 (Element 93) G-113 (20 May 1941)Klaus Clusius and Kurt Starke Zur Gewinnung von schwerem Wasser G-134 (24 February 1942) As the war raged on, the demand for men to provide armed service resulted in the drafting of many engineers and physicists, especially for the Russian Front; Paul O. Müller, who had worked on the Uranverein, was drafted and died in service on the Russian front. Starke had eluded military service in 1941, but, in a confrontation with Abraham Esau, Hermann Göring’s Bevollmächtiger (plenipotentiary) for nuclear physics research under the Reichsforschungsrat (RFR, Reich Research Council), threatened Starke with transfer to the Russian front in the fall of 1943. It was not until 1944 that Werner Osenberg, head of the planning board at the Reichsforschungsrat, was able to initiate calling back 5000 engineers and scientists from the front to work on research categorized as kriegsentscheidend (decisive for the war effort). By the end of the war, the number recalled had reached 15,000.Walker, 1993, 42-43 and 126-127.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix B; see the entry for the RFR.Macrakis, 1993, 94. From 1944, after completion of his Habilitation, Starke was an assistant at Walther Bothe's Institut für Physik (Institute of Physics) at the Kaiser- Wilhelm Institut für medizinische Forschung (KWImF, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research; today, the Max-Planck Institut für medizinische Forschung), in Heidelberg.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Stark. After the conclusion of World War II, between the ravages of the war and the restrictions of the Allied occupation forces in Germany, the prospects of meaningful scientific work were limited. By March 1947, Heinz Maier-Leibnitz, Kurt Stark, and other younger collaborators with Bothe at the Institut für Physik had left for North America. Stark taught and did research successively at McMaster University (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada), University of British Columbia (near Vancouver), and the University of Kentucky (Lexington, Kentucky).Walker, 1993, 181.In Memoriam Professor em.

In 1971, he moved his institute to the premises of the newly created and built Fachbereich Physikalische Chemie (Department of Physical Chemistry), and he was its first Dekan (dean).

In the early 20th century ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, then head of the religion, requested Baháʼís from the United States and Canada consider Scandinavian countries and Russia among the places Baháʼís should pioneer to. Later, after Finland gained independence from Russia, Baháʼís began to visit the Scandinavian area in the 1920s. Following a period of more Baháʼí pioneers coming to the country, Baháʼí Local Spiritual Assemblies spread across Finland while the national community eventually formed a Baháʼí National Spiritual Assembly in 1962.The Baháʼí Faith: 1844-1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Baháʼí Teaching & Consolidation Plan 1953-1963, Compiled by Hands of the Cause Residing in the Holy Land, pages 22 and 46. Some estimates in 2004 of the Baháʼís in Finland number about 500 Baháʼís including a winner of human rights award and a television personality. In 2005 there was an estimate of over 1,700 according to the Association of Religion Data Archives (relying on World Christian Encyclopedia). Early history The first mentions of the religion among Scandinavians happened in the era when Finland was politically united with the Russian Empire; the first mention of the Báb, who Baháʼís view as the herald to the founder of the religion, Baháʼu'lláh, was published in accounts of Persian travels by Scandinavians in 1869, and the first mentions of Baháʼu'lláh were made in 1896. Shoghi Effendi, then head of the religion, visited Finland in 1926. Josephine Kruka, Knight of Baháʼu'lláh, entered Finland and later, in 1938, Pastor Väinö Rissanen became the first Baháʼí of Finland and the first Baháʼí Local Spiritual Assembly of Finland was formed in Helsinki in 1953. In 1955, another Knight of Baháʼu'lláh, Greta Jankko arrived in Finland after having to leave her pioneer post in the Marquesas Islands. Greta served on every Local Spiritual Assembly in Finland during the Ten Year Plan as well as for most of the Nine Year Plan. She also spent some of her time in Lapland, especially to teach the Sámi. Greta edited and retranslated sections for the second Finnish edition of Baháʼu'lláh and the New Era, and she translated the first Finnish language editions of Gleanings from the Writings of Baháʼu'lláh, Baha'i Prayers, Some Answered Questions, The Will and Testament of ʻAbdu'l-Bahá, and The Dispensation of Baháʼu'lláh. When she arrived in Finland, there were just a handful of Baháʼís, mostly elderly ladies, in the Helsinki area. When she died in 1973, there were nearly a hundred Baháʼís at her funeral. =Growth= In 1957 Finland, Denmark, and other Scandinavian countries formed a regional Baháʼí National Spiritual Assembly. In 1959, Knight of Baháʼu'lláh Brigitte Hasselblatt moved to Turku from the Shetland Islands and married Milton Lundblade. After living some years there she moved to the United States but returned again to Finland to Salo in the summer of 1984 (in the meantime their first son Laurence Lundblade would later be one of the initial authors of the e-mail client Pine.) For 1957 through 1962 Finland Baháʼí institutions were part of the regional National Spiritual Assembly of Scandinavia and Finland.Baha'i World Statistics 2001 by Baha'i World Center Department of Statistics, 2001-08 In 1960, Hand of the Cause Adelbert Muhlschlegel visited in Finland. In 1962 Sweden, Finland, and Norway each elected their own National Spiritual Assembly. The members of the National Assembly who participated in the election of the Universal House of Justice in 1963 were Godratollah Bidardel, Greta Sofia Jankko-Badeau, Aminda Josephine Kruka, Mozaffar Namdar, Gudrun Ofstegaard, Maija-Liisa Ravola, Sirkka Inkeri Salmi, Mailis Kaarina Talvenheimo and Habibu'llah Zabihian. By the end of 1963 there were local spiritual assemblies in Helsinki, Lahti, Tampere, Turku, and groups of Baháʼís in Kaaresuvanto and isolated Baháʼís in Hämeenlinna, Kilo, Koski Tl, Rovaniemi, and Vartsalo. In 2019 there were 14 Local Spiritual Assemblies, and Baháʼís living in 87 localities. Development Following this period of largely internal development, the Baháʼí Faith in Finland began to be involved in regional developments. In the 1970s and 80s Finland Baháʼís helped translate Baháʼí literature into Estonian, Lithuanian and Latvian. Finland was among the national communities that responded to a survey on status of women in the community which was tabulated and summarized for the 1974 Statement to the 25th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women. In the mid-1960s in Alaska Angeline Giachery conceived of a plan to spread the religion across the circumpolar area and the idea received attention at the Intercontinental Conference in Helsinki in 1976 which was also attended by Hand of the Cause Ugo Giachery. Roma Raciulyte became a Baháʼí during a trip to Finland in the 1970s and is generally considered the first Lithuanian Baháʼí in recent times. Diverse involvements of the modern community Since its inception the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating the promotion of female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Baháʼís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Baháʼí teachings, in which they could become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Baháʼí socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. Since the 1980s the Baháʼís of Finland have greatly diversified their endeavours. In the late 1980s a group of Baháʼí musicians based in Naantali composed an album, Pohjantähti (North Star) simultaneously in Finnish and English out of a quest to be culturally creative instead of merely translating foreign interpretations of the religion into song. In 1990 Alaskan Baháʼís visited Finland as part of a circumpolar campaign to spread the religion especially among indigenous peoples. In January 1998 Dr. Sylvia I. Karlsson lead the Finnish Baháʼí community national convention on a full day seminar on ethical dimensions of Agenda 21 and sustainable development by giving the keynote talk as well as preparing parallel workshops on various chapters of Agenda 21 and summarizing the discussions. The position of the Baháʼí Faith in Finland reached national acknowledgment when in 1999 the educational authorities in Finland included courses mentioning the Baháʼí Faith in the curricula of primary and secondary schools. This relationship between national and civic events continued when in 2002 the Baháʼí community of Lappeenranta registered their regularly held public meeting for World Religion Day. This discussion was on the subject of world peace with participants of local Christian, civic and Muslim groups building on a decade of efforts. In 2003, Iranian Baháʼí émigré Melody Karvonen was awarded the 2003 Human Rights Worker of the Year by the Finnish League for Human Rights. The same year the government of Finland co-sponsored a resolution of the United Nations which was passed by a vote of 73 to 49, with 50 abstentions, by the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly expressing \\"serious concern\\" over continuing violations of human rights in Iran—and mentions specifically \\"continuing discrimination\\" against Baháʼís and other religious minorities. (see Persecution of Baháʼís.) Most recently, in 2003, the play The Seven Valleys was premiered at the Naantali Theatre and reviewed by Pentti Narvanen of the newspaper Rannikkoseudun sanomat. Based on the work of the same name by Baháʼu'lláh, the play has since been shown at other venues including in Lappeenranta. Aram Aflatuni was a Baháʼí TV talk show host of Härkää Sarvista, or \\"Grab the Bull by the Horns\\", which aired in Finland in 2007 viewed by 20 percent of the TV audience with a format that emphasized using a panel of experts and cooperative discussions to try to solve the participants' problems. Aram has since established a Baháʼí-inspired organization named Gutsy Go which won the first-ever 'Builders of the Century' award in Finland. Gutsy Go aims to give young people living in neighborhoods with bad reputations the tools they need to improve their communities. The firm received a cash prize of 1.5 million euros to develop its operations. Hartmut Grossmann was born in Germany, was a lecturer and head of the German Department of the Translators' Training Institute at University of Joensuu in Savonlinna. He has served on the National Spiritual Assemblies of the Baháʼís of Germany and of Finland, on the International Teaching Centre and then ultimately on the Universal House of Justice. After retiring in 2008, he and his wife, Ursula, moved back to Finland, subsequently returning to Germany where Ursula passed away in 2017 and Hartmut in 2018/. =Demographics= According to the membership register maintained by the National Spiritual Assembly of Finland, there were 760 Baháʼí living in Finland in 2019. The National Assembly is also administratively responsible for 68 Baháʼís residing in the North Calotte region of Sweden and Norway. While no official statistics on the numbers of Baha'is have been released, the Finland Census reports about 0.9 - 1.2% of the population as religious but non-Christian. The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland estimated the 2004 population of Baháʼís to be approximately 500. Operation World, another Christian organization, estimated 0.01%, also about 500 Baháʼís, in 2003.

Built in 1850 for wealthy merchant James Leavitt, the house is on the National Register of Historic Places and is now owned by the town of Waterboro, which operates the architecturally-significant structure as a house museum known as the Taylor/Frey/Leavitt House Museum. History and origins The builder of the Leavitt House, James Leavitt, moved to Waterboro Center with his family from nearby Alfred, Maine, between 1830 and 1840, and entered into business as \\"an astute businessman,\\" as a local historian put it. The merchant had several lines of business: he bought and sold local produce in Portland and Boston, and operated a general store near his house. He also bought pre-cut fabric in Boston, which he pieced out to local women, who then assembled the fabric into men's suits, shirts and trousers, which Leavitt sold back to clothiers in Boston, often at a healthy mark-up. The women were given credits at Leavitt's store in return: the merchant's extensive records for these transactions are today maintained at the Leavitt House. Leavitt's various businesses enabled him to make a fortune, and have an elaborate home built to suit his success as merchant. The James Leavitt House, completed in 1850, is significant for the level of interior detailing. The two-story Greek Revival home, which housed Leavitt, his wife and 12 children, boasts elaborate interior molding, carved corner blocks, a detail rarely seen on rural Maine homes. The house retains its original elaborate wallpaper, and also features \\"some of the finest wood-graining in the state.\\" \\"The sheer amount of surface that was grained indicates that this was probably not the work of an itinerant artist passing through town, but undertaken [by] a specialist like Jason Hamilton, a 'fancy painter' who lived in nearby Sanford and was listed in the Mercantile Union Business Directory in 1849,\\" notes the application for the House's nomination to the National Historic Places Register. \\"Interestingly, the grain painting at the Leavitt house does not necessarily try to mimic natural wood, rather the combinations of patterns, such as birds-eye maple and tiger-maple, used together on the doors suggest a much more artistic approach to the application. This suggestion is further supported by the grained pictures of the rooster and the swan that appear on the back doors of two cabinets.\\" Ownership succession The Leavitt House, built at what was once the most prosperous location in Waterboro Center, is a large home with seven bedrooms on its second floor. After the death of merchant James Leavitt in about 1880, the home became a second residence for the family. James Leavitt's son Benjamin embarked on a career as a prosperous merchant in Saco, Maine, and used his father's home as a summer residence. After Benjamin Leavitt's death, his daughter Louella Frey inherited the home; subsequently it passed to her two daughters, including writer Helen Taylor who set her book A Time to Recall in the family home. Mrs. Taylor's three sons sold the building to the town of Waterboro in 1989. The house was in exceptionally good condition, noted local historian Jim Carli: \\"It is truly an unspoiled dwelling owing to the fact that it was lived in year-round for only thirty years.\\" Because of its part-time occupancy by the Leavitt family and their heirs, the house survives in very nearly the original fashion in which it was built, with few alterations. Merchant James Leavitt,Leavitt was the son of William Leavitt, born in 1752 at Exeter, New Hampshire, and his wife Elizabeth (Hardy) Leavitt. William Leavitt was a descendant of Nehemiah Leavitt, born at Hingham, Massachusetts, and his wife Alice Cartee, widow of Daniel Gilman of Exeter, New Hampshire. born in Alfred, Maine, in 1797, and married to Lovey Stevens of York, Maine, died 7 September 1876, at Waterboro Center. His wife died in 1825. They are both buried at Waterboro Center, not far from the home they had built. The house is now a local historical museum.

The building houses grades 9-12 and also functions as the primary athletic building. History Northwestern High School was founded in 1948 as the result of a merge between Clay, Ervin, and Howard High Schools, during a period known as the \\"Consolidation Boom\\" when many other schools were also being consolidated. The Clay High School sign still stands outside the main entrance to the school. The school received its name because of its geographic location within Howard County, but the founders of the school also deliberately modeled the school after Northwestern University because of the university's reputation for scholastic excellence. Northwestern High School's school colors of purple and white and the school fight song \\"Go You Northwestern\\" were both directly adopted from Northwestern University. The school faced difficulties early in its history because it is located in a remote, rural area and there were no cities or towns included within its boundaries. Dayton Merrell, who graduated from the school in 1955 and has continued to live in the area ever since, remarked in an interview in 2017, \\"Sixty-eight years ago, that was a big deal... We had nothing but cornfields.\\" The class of 1949, the first class to graduate from Northwestern, contained only forty-two students. For the first seven years of its history, Northwestern did not have a gymnasium of any kind, so the school could only compete against other schools that would let them use their gymnasiums. As a result of this, for two years, Northwestern was the only school in the state that would compete against Crispus Attucks High School, an all-black high school in Indianapolis. Originally, basketball, baseball, and track were the only sports that Northwestern offered. Northwestern eventually became the first consolidated school to win the Kokomo Sectional against a top ten team in boys' basketball, a feat which the school replicated in both 1981 and 1982. In 2006, the school added a new auditorium to its main campus. The addition was controversial at the time, but the superintendent Ryan Snoddy affirmed in 2017 that he still thought it was the best decision. In June 2012, the school installed a wind turbine, making it the first school in the county to attempt to harness wind energy. The school paid roughly $2.5 million on the windmill, with most of the interest being covered by the federal government. At the time, school officials expected that the windmill would probably result in around seven million dollars worth in energy savings over the course of its projected twenty-five-year lifespan. In 2013, the school corporation adopted iPads for all students.

She toured the Theater Owners Bookers Association vaudeville circuit and made numerous recordings from 1923 to 1929 for various labels, including Gennett, Vocalion, and Columbia Records. On her recordings from 1923 her most frequent accompanist was pianist Porter Grainger; later accompanists included Fletcher Henderson, Louis Hooper, and Bob Fuller, among others. A few of her recordings are enlivened by kazoo solos performed by McCoy. In 1927, she briefly owned and performed in Jack's Cabaret in New York City. By 1930 she owned and operated a nightclub in Saratoga, New York.Harris 1994, p. 357. In 1938, she settled in Albany, New York, and was mostly inactive in music during the remainder of her life. McCoy is thought to have died in Albany, New York, about 1956. Author Derrick Stewart-Baxter wrote of McCoy, \\"She belongs to the great vaudeville tradition, but in all she does there is a strong jazz strain ... Possessing a lovely contralto voice and fine diction, she was able to project herself through even the worst recording ... It would be true to say that in the three years she was recording most prolifically she hardly ever made a bad record\\".Stewart-Baxter 1970, p. 94. Aliases McCoy recorded songs under various pseudonyms, including Amanda Brown (Columbia, Perfect and Pathe labels), Daisy Cliff (Guardsman label), Clara White or Bessie Williams (Oriole and Domino labels), Gladys White (Variety label), Fannie Johnson (Cameo) and Susan Williams (Lincoln label).

Ariat was launched by Beth Cross and Pam Parker in 1993. It has since become a popular brand in performance footwear for English and Western horseback riding, and is the official footwear sponsor of Professional Bull Riding, among other associations. History Ariat was founded in 1993 by Stanford Business School classmates Beth Cross and Pam Parker. While working for Bain & Company and consulting to Reebok, the co- founders saw an opportunity to apply athletic shoe technology to English and Western riding boots. In 1993, Ariat released its first two boot styles, then went on to hire a number of equestrians and horse enthusiasts. In the years following the company’s launch, it expanded into new performance western and English apparel, as well as workwear.The company also expanded its distribution in the U.S., Europe, Australia, Mexico, and Japan. In 2009, Ariat became the official sponsor of Professional Bull Riders (PBR). Ariat has since been cited by numerous publications as a popular brand in American performance footwear for both English and Western riding. In 2015, Ariat signed a sponsorship deal with the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI). In 2017, Ariat joined partners with the non-profit Jared Allen’s Homes For Wounded Warriors, an organization which builds homes for injured war veterans. In 2018, Ariat announced that they were continuing their partnership with the US Equestrian Federation (USEF), and Cross was awarded \\"Entrepreneur of the Year\\" in the Consumer Driven category by Ernst & Young. As of 2020, Ariat is reportedly the largest equestrian footwear and apparel company in the world. Product design Ariat manufactures boots in the United States, Mexico, Asia and Europe. Co-founder Beth Cross worked with biomechanical research groups and testing labs in the making of Ariat's boots, which are designed to be durable in outdoor environments, with patented Duratread outsoles, and patented Advanced Torque Stability technology, (ATS), a multi- layered lightweight sole with a gel-cushioned footbed and a heel stabilizer to provide more support while riding. In the late 1990s they introduced Hexcel cushioning technology for shock absorption while riding and on the ground, and introduced Cobalt technology in the early 2000s for further cushioning support. In 2006, the firm ventured into making western apparel, including woven shirts, tops and outdoor clothing for men and women. The clothing incorporates flame-resistant technology, which came into demand from the oil workers of Colorado. In 2018, Ariat released their waterproof FR HiVis H20 Proof Jacket.

An archaeological site at Bahia Wulaia has been associated with the Megalithic seasonal settlements there of the Yaghan peoples about 10,000 years ago.C. Michael Hogan, 2008 Known as the Wulaia Bay Dome Middens, the site revealed that the people created fish traps in the small inlets of the bay. The stonework for those traps has survived, according to C. Michael Hogan, and was used by Yaghan into the 19th century.C. Michael Hogan, 2008 In November 1859 a settlement known as Wulaia was the site of a Yaghan massacre of all but one of the crew and captain of , a schooner used by the South American Missionary Society. There had been a misunderstanding and cultural conflict between the parties. Yaghan ancient culture The Yaghan are believed to have migrated to the main island of Tierra del Fuego from the north by a land bridge available more than 12,000 years ago, which disappeared after the end of an Ice Age. From there they easily navigated by canoe to Navarino Island and other islands. They are the \\"most southernmost aboriginal people in the history of the world.\\" They created settlements in the coastal terraces on Navarino, building circular huts in the middle of ring middens. As they moved on a seasonal basis, numerous archeological sites of this period have been found on the island. They lived largely by taking fish and shellfish from the waters. Navarino has one of the most dense archeological concentrations in the world. This is believed to be due to the fact that the Yaghan were nomadic, so set up numerous settlements, and the island was little disturbed by outsiders until late in the 19th century.Monica A. Lindemann (2008) The Cape Horn Biosphere Reserve: A Cultural History of the Cape Horn Archipelago, University of North Texas Wulaia Massacre By the mid-19th century, Europeans had discovered the Yaghan. The naturalist Charles Darwin and Vice-Admiral FitzRoy of encountered the Yaghan at this site in 1831. Other English people became concerned about the lives of the indigenous peoples of this region, and organized missions to teach them European languages and religion. In England, what was first called the Patagonian Mission Society was founded to minister to the indigenous peoples of southern Chile and Argentina. The missionary George Packenham Despard came out to the mission at Keppel Island in the Falklands, bringing his wife and several children, including their adopted son Thomas Bridges. Despard persuaded Jemmy Button, a Yaghan native of Tierra del Fuego to visit Cranmer Station in 1858. (He was one of three Fuegians, as they were often called by English speakers, who was taken to England on the first return trip of HMS Beagle.) After many months, the group (including Button's wife and three children) were returned to Wulaia in December 1858. At the same time, the British recruited a party of nine Fuegians to visit Cranmer. This party soon became homesick; they had not had Button's earlier European experiences (he had learned some English and traveled to England). In addition, there were serious cultural misunderstandings between them and the British. In October 1859 a British crew in , a schooner owned by the missionary society, departed Keppel Island to return the natives to Wulaia. They arrived on 2 November after a very rough passage. Four days later, angered over an altercation with the crew, the Yaghan attacked and killed Captain Garland Phillips and all but one of the ship's crew on shore. The British party had been holding a Sunday service in a small chapel built at the settlement. The British men, sailors and catechist, were all clubbed to death. The only survivor was the ship's cook, who was still on board Allen Gardiner when the massacre occurred, and escaped the area in a dinghy. He managed to make peace with the natives and was found alive by the search parties that came to investigate and discovered the stripped and abandoned schooner on 1 March 1860. As a result of the attack, Despard of the Keppel Island mission petitioned to return to England with his wife and children. His adoptive son, Thomas Bridges, then 17, stayed on Keppel Island at the mission. He learned the Yaghan language and began his life's work of eventually compiling a grammar and dictionary of Yámana, containing more than 30,000 words. After returning to England in 1868-1869 to receive holy orders, in 1871 he was successful with another missionary family, in setting up a full mission at Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego. References * C.

Early career Hammond came from East Riding of Yorkshire, enjoyed a liberal education, and was a Master of Arts and Fellow of Merton College, Oxford. During the peace talks between the 13 colonies of the United States of America and the Kingdom of Great Britain that would culminate in the Treaty of Paris in 1783, he served as a Secretary to David Hartley; while in Paris, he also learned some French. Subsequently, Hammond was appointed chargé d'affaires at Vienna from 1788 to 1790, spent part of 1790 in Copenhagen, and in 1791 found himself Counsellor of Legation at Madrid. Minister to the United States Despite American grumbles over the lack of a British envoy since the peace treaty concluded the American revolution in 1783, the decision for the British was by no means a simple one. The Articles of Confederation lacked both a fixed seat of government and single leader to accredit an envoy, and few qualified diplomats desired the post and its yearly salary of £2,500. David Hartley, himself approached for the position, recommended his former secretary Hammond to Charles Jenkinson, who in turn passed on the name to newly appointed Foreign Secretary William Grenville. Hammond was soon given the job, boarded a ship for Philadelphia in September 1791 along with Edward Thornton, secretary of legation, and arrived five weeks later on 20 October. Hammond initially met with then Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, but waited to formally present himself to President George Washington before an American minister to England was chosen; his reception on 11 November 1791 formally established relations between the two countries. Although Hammond described his situation as \\"new, critical and rather embarrassing\\", he also stated that \\"If I accepted a quarter of the invitations to dinner and tea parties which I receive I should have little time for business\\", and said of the leading families that \\"I have reason to think most of them are Tories at heart.\\" Hammond had four children, aged oldest to youngest: William Andrew, George, Margaret, Edmund. The titles (including spelling) and dates in the timeline come directly from these papers. They continue: \\"In the year 1806, when Mr. Hammond was entitled, from length of service, to a pension of 1,200 l., a pension of 600 l. was granted to him, together with pensions of 150 l. a year to each of his four children.\\" His son, Edmund Hammond, would also join the Foreign Office. Hammond left his post on 14 August 1795, leaving the consul general at Philadelphia, Phineas Bond, in charge until Robert Liston arrived in America. Later career Following his return from the United States, Hammond became an Undersecretary at the Foreign Office. In this position he advised and befriended Grenville and met George Canning; Canning founded the newspaper the Anti-Jacobin in 1797, and Hammond acted as joint-editor. Hammond would later be sent to one or two posts in continental Europe, and sometime in the 1810s he was appointed as a commissioner on the Arbitration of Revolutionary Indemnities, and as such spent many years living alternatively in London and Paris. Hammond died in 1853 at the age of eighty-nine or ninety.

Biography Sophia Behrs was one of three daughters of a German physician Andrey Evstafievich Behrs (1808–1868) and his Russian wife Liubov Alexandrovna (née Islavinа, 1826–1886). Her maternal great-grandfather, Count Pyotr Zavadovsky, was the first Minister of education in Russia's history. Sophia was first introduced to Leo Tolstoy in 1862 when she was 18 years old. At 34, Tolstoy was 16 years her senior. On 17 September 1862 the couple became formally engaged after Tolstoy gave Sophia a written proposal of marriage, marrying a week later in Moscow. At the time of their marriage, Leo Tolstoy was well known as a novelist after the publication of The Cossacks. On the eve of their marriage, Tolstoy gave Sophia his diaries that detailed his sexual relations with female serfs. In Anna Karenina, 34-year-old Konstantin Levin, a semi-autobiographical character behaves similarly, asking his 19-year-old fiancée Kitty to read his diaries and learn of his past transgressions. The diary included the fact that Tolstoy had fathered a child by a woman who remained on the Yasnaya Polyana estate. In Anne Edwards' Sonya: The Life of Countess Tolstoy, she describes Sophia as having a deep fear that Tolstoy would re-enter a relationship with the other woman. Sophia Tolstaya and daughter Alexandra Tolstaya The Tolstoys had 13 children, eight of whom survived childhood. The family was prosperous, owing to Tolstoy's efficient management of his estates and to the sales of his works, making it possible to provide adequately for the family. Sophia acted as copyist of War and Peace, copying and editing the manuscript seven times from beginning to end at home at night by candlelight after the children and servants had gone to bed, using an inkwell pen and sometimes needing a magnifying glass to read her husband's notes. In 1887, Tolstaya regained interest in the relatively new art of photography, which she had learned to practise at age 16. She took over 1,000 photographs that documented her life, including with Tolstoy, and the decline of the pre-Soviet Russian Empire. She was a diarist and documented her life with Leo Tolstoy in a series of diaries which were published in English translation in the 1980s.The latest condensed version, The Diaries of Sofia Tolstoy, translated by Cathy Porter, was published by Alma Books, London, in 2009 (). Tolstaya wrote her memoirs as well, which she titled My Life. Family of Leo Tolstoy, 1887 After many years of an increasingly troubled marriage — the couple argued over Tolstoy's desire to give away all his private property — Leo left Sophia abruptly in 1910, aged 82, with their daughter Alexandra, and his doctor, Dushan Makovicki (Dušan Makovický). Tolstoy died 10 days later in a railway station, and Sophia was kept away from him (as depicted in the film The Last Station). Following the death of her husband, Sophia continued to live in Yasnaya Polyana and survived the Russian Revolution in relative peace. She died in 1919.

He played for the Cleveland Indians for 28 games during the 1928 Cleveland Indians season. Biography Dorman began his professional baseball career with the Tyler Trojans of the D-Class Lone Star League. With the Trojans, he had a batting average of .408, 39 home runs, and 20 stolen bases. He led the league in home runs, batting average, and doubles, and as a result the Cleveland Indians brought him onto their major league roster. In his major league debut on August 21, he faced the 46-year-old Jack Quinn, and doubled in his first at- bat, drawing praise from Indians manager Roger Peckinpaugh. He spent the last month of the season as the team's center fielder, and finished the year with a .363 batting average. In 1929, Dorman failed to make the team out of spring training, and was assigned to the New Orleans Pelicans of the Southern Association. On the season, he had a .301 batting average in 102 games for the Pelicans. He joined the Indians in mid-September along with Zeke Bonura and Mike Powers, but none of the three played a game for Cleveland that season. In February 1930, Dorman's wife of 15 months died. He spent the season with the Indianapolis Indians and the Kansas City Blues, playing in a combined 105 games for the two teams. In 1931, Dorman spent the season with the Terre Haute Tots, finishing the season with a .283 batting average. He suffered an accident in 1931, and after the season never again played professionally.

Crowley, 113 U.S. 703 (1885), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States.  Facts  The plaintiff had been arrested by the defendant, the Chief of Police of the City and County of San Francisco, for an alleged violation of an ordinance of the board of supervisors of that municipality. The ordinance prohibited the washing and ironing in public laundries and wash houses within defined territorial limits from ten o'clock at night to six in the morning.. The petition for the writ of habeas corpus set forth the arrest and detention of the petitioner by the chief of police, the ordinance under which the arrest was made, the complaint before the police judge, and the issue of the warrant under which he was taken into custody. It then proceeds to state that the petitioner had for several years been engaged in working for hire in a public laundry in the City and County of San Francisco, and complied with all the laws of the United States and of California and the ordinances of the city and county except in washing at the hours mentioned; that the business of carrying on a laundry is a lawful one, in which a large number of the subjects of the Emperor of China have been and are engaged in the said city and county within the limits prescribed by the ordinance; that there have been for several years great antipathy and hatred on the part of the residents of that city and county against the subjects of China residing and doing business there; that such antipathy and hatred have manifested themselves in various ways and under various forms for the purpose of compelling the subjects of China to quit and abandon their business and residence in the city and county and state; that owing to that feeling, and not otherwise, and not for any sanitary, police, or other legitimate purpose, but in order to force those subjects engaged in carrying on the business of a laundry in the City and County of San Francisco to abandon the exercise of their lawful vocation and their only means of livelihood, the supervisors passed the ordinance in question; that the petitioner has been and is earning his living exclusively by working at washing and ironing for hire, and in order to gain a livelihood is obliged to work late in the night, and has no other lawful vocation; that on the first of January 1884, his employer paid the license collector of the city and county six dollars, the amount required by the ordinance to obtain a license to carry on the business of a laundry, and obtained from him a license to carry on the business at a designated place within the prescribed limits. The petition also avers that section four of the ordinance is in contravention of the provisions of the Burlingame Treaty and of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States in that it deprives them of the equal protection of the laws.  Issue before the court  On hearing of the application for the writ, the judges of the circuit court were divided in opinion on several questions that arose. The questions were: #Whether section four of the ordinance mentioned is void on the ground that it is not within the police power of the Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco. #Whether said section is void on the ground that it discriminates between those engaged in the laundry business and those engaged in other classes of business. #Whether said section is void on the ground that it discriminates between the different classes of persons engaged in the laundry business. #Whether said section is void on the ground that it deprives a man of the right to labor at all times. #Whether said section is void on the ground that it is unreasonable in its requirements, in restraint of trade, or upon any other ground apparent upon the face of the ordinance, or appearing in the petition.  Opinion of the court  The opinion of the presiding judge being that the said section was valid and constitutional, the application for the writ was denied, and the judgment entered upon the denial is brought to the high court for review. Justice Stephen J. Field, delivered the opinion of the Court.

Two years later, however, the government re-approved construction and Kuwait Integrated Petroleum Industries Company was created to manage its operations after 2019.

Korea's SK Engineering & Construction was charged with constructing the hydrogen plants, as well as the compression and sulphur recovery units; Daelim Industrial was to construct storage tanks; and Hyundai Engineering and Construction was to be responsible for the marine works.

Cancellation In March 2009, the Kuwaiti government informed the contractors to halt construction, citing a drop in oil prices. Some investment analysts predicted the project's cancellation as early as December 2008. Furthermore, the project encountered political opposition by lawmakers who claimed that the government had not consulted the Central Tenders Committee before awarding contracts to foreign companies. Re- approval However, in June 2011, the Supreme Petroleum Council—Kuwait's oil agency—re-approved construction of the refinery in Al Ahmadi, Kuwait. Construction had been halted due to financial concerns and political wrangling, but the Oil Minister affirmed that Kuwait was indeed moving forward with the refinery that would be able to process 615,000 barrels of oil per day. The estimated cost is $14.5 billion, or 4 billion dinar. As of May 2012 Kuwait's three existing refineries produce 930,000 barrels per day. The Kuwait National Petroleum Company announced that it would relaunch a tender in June 2012. The revised project timeline aims for completion in June 2019.

The battle The First Serbian Uprising had begun in 1804 with the expulsion of the ruling janissary elite and the proclamation of an independent Serbian state by the revolution's leader, Karađorđe. The Ottoman Sultan, Selim III sent a huge Turkish force to quell the uprising. The Serbian high command decided to meet the Turkish force under Ibrahim Bushati, pasha of Shkodër, at Deligrad. The Serbian right wing numbered 6,000 men under the command of Mladen Milovanović at Bela Palanka. The center consisted of 18,000 troops which would be placed at the Kunovaci mountain. The left wing would be composed of 6,000 men under the command of Milenko Stojković with an additional 4,500 reserve troops to guard from any possible Turkish flank attack from Niš. Stanoje Glavaš would command the elite and cavalry troops whose job was to delve deep into enemy territory and harass them as much as possible. Tomo Milinović was a head of artillery and made significant effort by good positioning and frequent relocation of the cannons. The Turkish Army consisted of 55,000 regular Nizam troops with additional auxiliary and Janissary support. The Serbian army withstood several enemy offensives. The Serbian rebels also attacked the Turkish positions numerous times and managed to capture nine Turkish cannons. Meanwhile, the elite troops of Stanoje Glavaš effectively liberated Prokuplje thereby splitting the Turkish army in two. The Turkish wing under the command of Pazvanoglu was swiftly defeated by Mladen Milovanović and the Ottoman force was routed. The battle provided a decisive victory for the Serbs and bolstered the morale of the outnumbered Serbian rebels. To avoid total defeat, Ibrahim Pasha negotiated a six-week truce with Karageorge.

In World War I the Andania was used to transport the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and Royal Dublin Fusiliers to Cape Helles for the landings at Suvla. The landing at Suvla Bay by the British IX Corps was part of the August Offensive during the Battle of Gallipoli. Description The Andania measured and had twin funnels and masts. The hull was made of steel and the vessel was propelled by a twin propeller configuration, powered by eight quadruple- expansion engines creating a service speed of 15 knots. The Andania held accommodations for 520 second-class and 1,540 third-class passengers. Her sister ships were the and which were almost identical and \\"cater(ed) only for second and third class passengers.

In August 1914 it was requisitioned as a troopship and made several trips carrying Canadian troops. For a few weeks in 1915 the Andania was used to accommodate German POWs in the Thames. In the summer of 1915 it was used in the Gallipoli campaign when she was used to transport the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and Royal Dublin Fusiliers to Cape Helles for the landings at Suvla. After transporting more Canadian troops in 1916, it returned to passenger service in 1917 on the Liverpool-New York route. The Andania left Liverpool on 26 January 1918 with 40 passengers and a crew of around 200. It was part of a convoy of seven ships. On 27 January the ship was hit amidships by a torpedo from German submarine captained by Leo Hillebrand two miles north-northeast of Rathlin East (Altacarry Head) lighthouse on Rathlin Island (County Antrim). The ship immediately took a list to starboard and began to sink. Attempts were made to tow the ship but it sank after a few hours.

A man saved Weller's life by pulling him out and asked Weller to pass on the favor as payment.

In March 2017, Weller suffered a minor stroke that partially paralyzed his left side. While still committed to helping those he encounters, he decided to end his regular freeway patrols.

Krayl was born in Weinsberg, and educated at the school of applied arts and the technical college of Stuttgart. He began his career working for architects in Nuremberg and Freiburg. He did technical work in Ingolstadt during World War I. In the years immediately after the War, Krayl was involved with the Arbeitsrat für Kunst, the November Group, the Glass Chain, and Der Ring, along with Walter Gropius, Bruno Taut, and other luminaries of the Expressionist movement. Krayl's paintings and drawings from this period are richly imaginative and visionary, with titles like \\"Cosmic building,\\" \\"Dream city,\\" and \\"Light greetings from my star house.\\"Timothy O. Benson et al., Expressionist Utopias, Berkeley, University of California Press, 2001; pp. 45, 115, 123, 231. Krayl was one of the architects interested in the possibilities of the \\"glass architecture\\" advocated by the writer Paul Scheerbart.Rosemarie Haag Bletter, \\"The Interpretation of the Glass Dream -- Expressionist Architecture and the History of the Crystal Metaphor,\\" Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Vol. 40 No. 1 (March 1981), pp. 20-43; see pp. 37-9. In 1920 Krayl began designing \\"suspended and swinging architecture,\\" a feature of Scheerbart's 1914 novel The Gray Cloth. Krayl designed a \\"Crystaline Star House\\" that hung from the side of a cliff.Chad Randl, Revolving Architecture: A History of Buildings that Rotate, Swivel, and Pivot, Princeton, NJ, Princeton Architectural Press, 2008; p. 67. Krayl also wrote a series of articles that were published in Taut's journal Frühlicht (\\"Daybreak\\"). Simultaneously, Krayl worked in the practical and pragmatic side of architecture. He held a position on the board of works for the city of Magdeburg from 1921 to 1938. He designed buildings that were constructed in Magdeburg and elsewhere, including the health insurance building in Magdeburg, a union office, and apartment buildings. In the 1921-1924 years, Krayl was Bruno Taut's assistant while Taut was the city architect in Magdeburg; together they executed a program of facade painting to alleviate the grimness of urban architecture. (The Constructivist artist Ilya Ehrenburg saw their work in 1922, and criticized it for \\"its disproportion and dadaistic hysteria.\\")Joan Ockman, \\"Reinventing Jefim Golyscheff: Lives of a Minor Modernist,\\" Assemblage, No. 11 (April 1990), pp. 70-106; see p. 81. In 1933, when the Nazi regime came to power, Krayl was accused of being a Bolshevik (a false charge). As a result, he was unemployed as an architect through 1937. From 1938 to 1946 he worked as a draftsman for the national railway. He died in Werder (Havel) in 1947. \\"We want to look into the distant future and show what is to come....\\" -- Carl Krayl to Walter Gropius, 1919.Valerie J.

He served in the United States Navy during the Mexican–American War and as a Union Army general during the American Civil War. Later in life he was a judge and a state legislator. Early life and career Chapman was born in Holland, Massachusetts in 1832. At the age of six, Chapman and his family moved to Indiana. His father and uncle published newspapers in Terre Haute and then in Indianapolis,Warner, p. 80. including Indiana State Sentinel, a pro-democratic newspaper. Chapman later studied at Marion County Seminary. In 1847 Chapman was appointed to the U. S. Navy as a midshipman. He served on the frigates USS Cumberland and USS Constitution until 1850, when he resigned following the death of his uncle. He then had a short-lived career in the mercantile business, and afterward he studied law. Chapman was admitted to the bar in 1857. From 1854-55, he edited and published his own newspaper called the Indiana Republican. He became the assistant clerk to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1860.Warner, p. 80. Civil War service At the beginning of the American Civil War in 1861, he resigned his clerk position to volunteer in the Union Army. On November 2 he was commissioned a major in the 3rd Indiana Cavalry. Chapman briefly led the cavalry division of the Army of the Ohio in May of the following year. Transferring to the infantry, he commanded a brigade in the Army of the Potomac until June 27, 1862.Eicher, p. 170. Chapman as a colonel in the Union Army Chapman was promoted to lieutenant colonel on October 25, 1862. He fought at the Second Battle of Bull Run in August, the Battle of Antietam in September, and the Battle of Fredericksburg in December. On March 12, 1863, Chapman was promoted to colonel, and that May he participated in the Battle of Chancellorsville. Returning to the cavalry service, Chapman led his regiment during the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Here his command was part of Col. Thomas C. Devin's brigade, and was noted as the first Union soldiers to engage Confederate forces approaching Gettysburg via the Cashtown road.George Henry Chapman, civilwarindiana.com; Warner, p. 80. Shortly after the battle, Chapman was given brigade command in the cavalry of the Army of the Potomac until March 1864. Chapman participated in the Valley Campaigns of 1864 against Confederate Lt. Gen. Jubal Early's forces, lasting from May to October. He was promoted to the rank of brigadier general on July 21, 1864, to rank from that date.President Abraham Lincoln sent the nomination for the appointment to the United States Senate on December 12, 1864 and the Senate confirmed the appointment on February 14, 1865. Eicher, 2001, p. 719. Chapman led a cavalry brigade in the Union Army of the Shenandoah from August 6 until September 19, when he was wounded during the Third Battle of Winchester. Recovered by the following month, Chapman resumed leading a cavalry brigade in the Shenandoah Valley. Chapman (seated) and his staff during the American Civil War Beginning on January 5, 1865, Chapman led a cavalry division of the Army of the Shenandoah.Eicher, p. 170. 3rd Division, Cavalry Corps, January 5-30, 1865; 2nd Division, Cavalry Corps, January 30-April 19, 1865. After the Battle of Waynesboro, Virginia on March 2, he was ordered to remain in the Shenandoah Valley while the rest of the Union forces headed for Petersburg, Virginia. Chapman had with him now three small regiments and a few artillery pieces to hold the Valley. Beginning on April 19, 1865, he was given command of the cavalry division assigned to Washington, D.C. In recognition of his performance at Winchester in September 1864, on January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Chapman for appointment to the grade of brevet major general of volunteers, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.Eicher, 2011, p. 711. Postbellum After the war, Chapman spent two months serving on court- martial boards. His military career ended with his resignation on January 7, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 719. He then served as a judge of the Criminal Court of Marion County, Indiana for five years. He also served as receiver for two financially challenged railroads during the 1870s. He then served as a state legislator in the Indiana Senate, after being elected to the Senate in 1880.Warner, p. 81 In June 1882 he died near Indianapolis, Indiana, and was buried at Crown Hill Cemetery located in Indianapolis.

He is the Apprentice to the ExtraOrdinary Wizard, Marcia Overstrand. He was once a member of the Young Army, known as Boy 412.Septimus Heap Official Site  Description  Septimus is a small and timid-looking boy, with green wizard eyes and curly blond hair, formerly wearing a sheepskin jacket with purple and yellow stripes, and red hat during his Young Army days. Now he wears the traditional green robes of the ExtraOrdinary apprentice to Marcia and a pair of brown boots. He was very thin when he was in the Young Army. Later he filled up more due to Aunt Zelda's cabbage sandwiches in Magyk. Development According to author Angie Sage, the character was in her mind for a long time, and she had already decided what would happen to Septimus in the end but was not exactly sure how she would make the character get there or who he would meet on his journey. For her, Septimus was someone who was in a strange and hostile world and who did not have a clue about who he really was.  In the Story  Before meeting the Heaps = At twelve hours old, Septimus was taken away from his mother Sarah Heap by the Matron Midwife on the commands of the evil Necromancer, DomDaniel. It was planned for him to be raised to become apprentice to DomDaniel. However, due to a mix -up, the midwife's own son was taken. Septimus was raised in the Young Army, known as Boy 412, up until the end of Magyk. = After meeting his family = In the very first book Magyk after Septimus was taken away, Silas and Sarah later adopt the orphaned princess of their Castle. When Jenna, the princess, is discovered, the ExtraOrdinary wizard Marcia Overstrand takes her away from the Heaps and circumstance had it that Boy 412 ended up escaping with them to Silas Heap's Aunt; Aunt Zelda's place. There the others discover Boy 412's magical powers and he, together with Jenna and their brother Nicko discover a hidden Dragon-Boat and save Marcia from DomDaniel. Marcia accepts Boy 412 as her apprentice, and for a return gift, Aunt Zelda reveals him to be Septimus Heap. The second book Flyte finds Septimus as the apprentice to Marcia. His elder brother Simon kidnaps Jenna in envy of Septimus stealing his apprenticeship. Septimus along with Nicko goes out in search of Jenna and they are accompanied by his Young Army friend Boy 409 or better known as Wolf-Boy. They find Jenna in the Port and take the Dragon-Boat from Aunt Zelda's to fight Simon who damages the Dragon-Boat extensively. Septimus saves Marcia again from a placement by Simon. He found the long-lost flyte charm. The third book Physik finds Septimus in great danger as the ghost of an evil Queen Etheldredda sends him back in time 500 years ago. There Septimus becomes the apprentice to a noted alchemist called Marcellus Pye and learns about physik. Jenna and Nicko along with a new girl called Snorri, rescue him and Marcia destroys the evil queen. Septimus cures the people of the Castle from the which was spreading. In Queste, Septimus is tricked to go on a deadly quest by an old and nasty ghost called Tertius Fume. He eventually goes on to the House of Foryx to search Nicko and Snorri who were trapped back in time in the previous book. Along with Jenna and Beetle, his friend, they search and bring back Nicko and Snorri. His magical power development is noticeable. \\"Syren\\" sees Septimus promoted to Senior Apprentice as he was the only ExtraOrdinary Apprentice to have survived - much less completed - the Queste. With his newfound freedom he sets off to find Jenna, Nicko, Beetle and Snorri (who were still at the Trading Post) on Spit Fyre, to discover them tucked away safely on Jenna's father's (Milo Banda) ship: the Cerys. Events lead to Septimus, Jenna, Beetle and an injured Spit Fyre becoming stranded on a beautiful island and meeting Syrah Syara - a 513-year-old girl possessed by the Syren. Eventually Syrah is freed from the Syren and the friends all sail home together on the Cerys.  Character Speciality  Magykal Power = Septimus is the Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (Silas Heap). Therefore, he is gifted with extreme magical powers. When Marcia gives him a charm to be invisible in Magyk, he was the first to disappear without even uttering the charm. This made Marcia realize that he had extreme magical powers. She asked him to be her apprentice which he later accepted. The Dragon-Boat also realised this magical power when Septimus held the Dragon's tiller. When Jenna, Nicko and he went to find Marcia aboard The Vengeance, he showed his magical skill by being clever enough to utter new spells so that all three of them can see each other even if they are invisible. He can transfix (paralyse) bigger beings like horses as well as unreal things like shadows as demonstrated in Flyte. He was the first one to discover the complete Flyte charm in many years and is able to fly successfully. When he went back in time to Marcellus Pye, he learnt all that he could about alchemy and \\"Physik\\" and was even able to cure the ' which infected the Castle inhabitants. He is also able to do a complete Projection of a human and keep it relatively solid as he demonstrated in the House of Foryx in Queste, where in the beginning of the book he was able to conjure sound, which many ExtraOrdinary cannot do. =Relationships, likes and dislikes = Septimus is a loving and caring boy, fond of his adopted sister Jenna, brother Nicko, friends Beetle and Wolf Boy (Boy 409), tutor Marcia and pet dragon Spit Fyre. His relationship with his elder brother Simon is ruined in Flyte when Simon tried to kidnap Jenna and kill Marcia, but maintains a healthy relationship with the other Heap brothers and is closest to Nicko Heap. His relationship with Simon is later repaired when he turns away from Darke in Fyre. He rarely spends time around the Forest Heaps: Sam, Jo-Jo, Edd and Erik Heap, as they live in the Forest most of the time, but he is still close to them, as proved in Queste. Although he spends most of his time at Wizard Tower, he loves it when he gets a chance to meet Sarah and Silas and roam around the Castle with Jenna as is evident in Flyte. Septimus loves catching bugs and has vertigo which he faces, many times in the series like when he walks along Snake Slipway in Physik or going along the toll bridge to the House of Foryx in Queste. He likes having FizzFroot with his friend Beetle but hates it when he has to go on a sled ride with him under the Manuscriptorium's Ice Tunnels. He is also good friends with Wolf Boy, also known as Boy 409, as they were friends in their Young Army days. It is possible that when he was Boy 412 he had a slight crush on Jenna, as when he would be embarrassed when he had to dress silly in front of her and he would care for her more than any other person, but whether or not he still has it is still unknown. He does, however, seem to develop a more prominent crush on Syrah Syara, an ExtraOrdinary Wizard apprentice 500 years past who was lost to the Queste. Whether or not she returns his affections is unclear - she did indeed smile at him when he took her hand, but that may be because he was some of the first human contact she had had in 500 years. In Fyre, he and Rose are heavily implied to have a mutual crush on each other, which is most likely due to Septimus regularly visiting the infirmary to visit Syrah. Syrah is said to have forgotten about the events of Syren, but does get an unsteady feeling when looking at Septimus. =Possessions = Septimus wears an ExtraOrdinary apprentice belt around his waist in which he keeps all his small charms including the Flyte charm. He wears the Dragon ring of Hotep-Ra around his finger. He still has his Young Army Camp back pack and keeps an interesting collection of stuff from his Young Army days which can be handy and useful at any time. His backpack is ruined by a pack of wolverines in the forest when he goes out in search of Jenna in Flyte. He had a green rock that Jenna gave him in Magyk, but it hatched into Spit Fyre.  Reception  The character was widely accepted as being extremely impressive and a well-written standalone. Manila Standard said that his character comes off as an intriguing boy, who is taught early on to live cautiously (in his Young Army days), yet he longs for the love and affection of a family. Sabina Qazi of Dawn.com said that sometimes Sage has given too much attention to the secondary characters and that takes away the heroism of the protagonist Septimus. Also, the ease with which they dispatch their enemy, takes away his glory a little but also \\"this very element, makes for light and humorous reading and renders the children more identifiable.\\" She also said that Septimus was quite identifiable when compared with real world and comes off like the most intelligent but quiet boy in class whom we see at every school.

Biography Donald Hankey was born in Brighton, Sussex, the youngest child of Robert Alers Hankey and Helen Bakewell Hankey. The senior Hankey returned to England with his Australian wife after having made his fortune sheep farming in South Australia. Maurice Hankey was one of Donald's brothers. As his father and his three older brothers had done, Donald attended Rugby School and from there he entered the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich in the autumn of 1901 when he was not yet seventeen. After what he later remembered as “the two most miserable years of my life” at Woolwich Academy, Hankey received his commission as a second lieutenant, joined the Royal Garrison Artillery and was ultimately stationed in Mauritius until serious ill-health led to his return to England on extended sick leave at the end of 1906. With his military career apparently cut short, three considerations entered into Hankey's view of his future. One was his long-standing attraction to an eventual career as a Church of England clergyman; another was a recently formed fascination with the challenge of ministering in some way to the manifold needs of the urban poor; and finally, a comfortable legacy at his father's death (1906) gave him the means to make these two objectives practicable. Accordingly, he spent four months in residence at Rugby House, a mission in one of London's roughest pockets of poverty, and at the same time enrolled in a “crammer” at Charterhouse with the aim of gaining admittance to university and ultimately to ordination in the Church. Rugby Mission opened Hankey's eyes to what it might take to work effectively with young people in the slums, but he did succeed in entering Oxford. Having resigned his army commission and having treated himself to a four-month holiday on the Continent, Hankey began his theological studies as a member of Corpus Christi College. His three years at Oxford were fruitful. His theological studies gave focus to his convictions, and he produced what was eventually published as The Cross, a short book on the Atonement. Still more crucial, however, was Hankey's introduction to life at the Oxford and Bermondsey Mission, established and maintained by Oxonians in what was then a notoriously squalid London neighbourhood south of the Thames. His connection with Bermondsey became one of the most decisive influences in Donald Hankey's life. After Oxford (and after a return visit to Mauritius by way of Kenya and Madagascar), Hankey entered the clergy school in Leeds, but found it stultifying and soon gravitated back to Bermondsey where he plunged into the demanding work of the Oxford mission's several boys' clubs. But what Hankey had assumed would be his path to ordination in the Church of England continued to lead him in unexpected ways. For various reasons, as he accustomed himself to the life of an Oxford missionary among the noise and stench of Bermondsey, it came to seem all too congenial and curiously unchallenging. Accordingly, (dressed as a labourer, an identity he sometimes assumed in London's mean streets), Hankey sailed for Australia as a steerage passenger, seeking first of all hard manual work and also the chance eventually to establish a wholesome refuge for London's hopeless poor somewhere in the vast reaches of the sub-continent. Farm work, travel, and a series of articles on “Australian Life” for the Westminster Gazette occupied this interval. Returning to England and to Bermondsey in the winter of 1913, Hankey resumed his work with the Mission, looking ahead to a more constructive sojourn in Australia the next summer and throwing himself into the writing of a book on Jesus and the failings of the contemporary church. That book, The Lord of All Good Life, was headed for publication and Hankey was all but headed back to Australia when war came in August 1914. He put in for a commission, but hearing that Lord Kitchener had called for one hundred thousand recruits under thirty, Hankey (who was some two months short of that limit) decided that as a “possible parson” he preferred “experience in the ranks,” and on 8 August enlisted as a private in the 7th Battalion of the Rifle Brigade. Though they naturally stood out, “gentleman rankers” such as Donald Hankey were not unknown in what became spoken of as “Kitchener’s Mob”; but few, like Hankey, had gone to a military academy and had previously held commissions. So given the extreme needs of the new army, Hankey's military experience marked him at once, and within a week he was made a sergeant, then sent to barracks at Aldershot and later billeted upon elderly Mrs. Coppin of Firs Cottage in nearby Elstead. His few short months there, training recruits and sharing meaningfully in their lives, mediating to some degree between humble men and the rigid authority above them, were among the happiest and most fulfilling days of Hankey's life. They corresponded, too, with the beginnings of his recognition as a writer; The Lord of All Good Life “by Donald Hankey, Sergeant, Rifle Brigade,” was published in October of that year. Its modest but gratifying reception could be explained in part by the technically accurate but essentially misleading identification of its author as a soldier in the ranks. Hankey had found his relationship to his fellow men-in-arms more deeply satisfying even than work among London's poor, and his book subtitled “A study of the greatness of Jesus and the weakness of His Church” gave him needed confidence in his promise as a writer. From Elstead his posting to dismal Borden Camp was a next step toward active combat. About this time the captain put in charge of Hankey's company turned out to be such a detested contrast to the man Donald had been serving under that he gave up his sergeant's stripes in order to be transferred to another company. This incident was part of the inspiration for what became Hankey's most popularly admired essay, “The Beloved Captain,” an uncharacteristically effusive tribute to the memory of Captain Ronald Hardy, who as a lieutenant had been Hankey's platoon commander. Hankey's two tours of combat duty were separated by about a year and by a change in rank from corporal in the Rifle Brigade to second lieutenant in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment. The first culminated in his being wounded near Ypres on 30 July 1915. Since crossing the Channel in May, Hankey had begun to write about the war, more in the form of reflective essays than in personal narrative; but his wounding was the basis for an impressionistic and somewhat disguised account of that particular experience, later published as The Honour of the Brigade. During his protracted convalescence, Hankey was prompted to apply for a commission. Various considerations were involved in this decision, especially the urging of his older brother Maurice, himself a former captain in the Royal Marine Artillery who was already well along in what would become a distinguished career as Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defense and eventually Cabinet Secretary. At length, and not without misgivings, Donald was commissioned, finally joining the “Warwicks” infantry regiment, and returned to action. In the meantime Hankey was becoming an acclaimed, though as yet anonymous, author of a series of essays appearing in The Spectator under the nom de plume “A Student in Arms.” In essence, Hankey's increasingly popular essays were a comprehensive meditation on how Britain's citizen army was meeting the unprecedented challenge of war. In general, they fell somewhere between the jingoistic enthusiasm with which the Great War tended to be greeted at its outset and the bleak disillusionment so strikingly evident in the work of those writers who survived it. Modestly and thoughtfully, Hankey spoke of the ordinary soldiers’ common ordeal in terms that his readers at home found sobering but reassuring. In their day, collected in two volumes published in the spring of 1916 by Andrew Melrose and (posthumously) in 1917, the pieces that comprise A Student in Arms were received with what must be called gratitude; today they provide valuable insight into how the 1914-18 war appeared to many who, both as civilians and in the military, actually experienced it whether facing combat or waiting anxiously at home. It is not surprising that the later essays written by the “Student in Arms” during his second close-up view of war are significantly more sombre. Some, in fact, were rejected by the Spectator owing to their “change in tone.” The battle-tested Hankey's sympathies for the increasingly younger officers and men become ever more acute; his confidence that their sacrifice will be sufficiently honoured grows less certain. His brief first-hand participation in the cataclysmic opening day of the Battle of the Somme and its sickening aftermath mark some of Hankey's final letters with unmistakable signs of shock. After a short respite at an Army School behind the lines, Hankey was back in the trenches near Le Transloy. On 6 October, he wrote in calm resignation to his sister Hilda that heavy fighting was just ahead. It is part of the Hankey legend that as he and his men waited to go “over the top” at 1:30 on the afternoon of 12 October 1916, Lt Hankey was heard to tell them, “If you are wounded, ‘Blighty’; if killed, the Resurrection!” Hankey died in that attack and was buried near where he fell. That grave was never located, and his name appears on the huge Thiepval memorial to the 70,000 missing and unidentified dead who fought on the Somme.

They are just outside the southeastern corner of Death Valley National Park, southeast of the Saddle Peak Hills. The road south from Shoshone to Baker passes through the hills. History From 1831 to 1848, the Old Spanish Trail passed from Salt Spring on Salt Creek east of the Salt Spring Hills near its confluence with the Amargosa River through the hills near Amargosa Spring.Edward Leo Lyman, Overland Journey from Utah to California: Wagon Travel from the City of Saints to the City of Angels, University of Nevada Press, 2008. In 1849, when Jefferson Hunt led a Mormon party of several wagons down the Old Spanish Trail to Los Angeles, they camped at Salt Spring east of the Salt Spring Hills. Some of the party discovered gold in the creek and traced it to a quartz vein in the nearby hills near Amargosa Spring. The Salt Spring Hills were named for Salt Spring, on the Mormon Road that passed just west of the hills, where the gold was first found. This discovery which became known once the party reached the Rancho Santa Ana del Chino, set off the first gold rush in the Mojave Desert. Several mining companies attempted to mine in the hills from the early 1850s.Vredenburgh, Larry M., 1994. Fort Irwin and Vicinity: History of Mining Development in Robert E.

The Stagemaster is similar in appearance to a Stratocaster with a few cosmetic and functional differences, and is typically classified as a Superstrat. Generally, these differences are: *A reverse headstock *A tremolo system (Mostly Licensed Floyd Rose, with the Stagemaster HSS NLT model featuring 2-point standard tremolo) *Humbucker pickups combined with single coil pickups *A contoured neck heel (Rounded corner where the neck meets the body) *A slightly narrower body *24 fret necks (Early models had 22 fret necks) *One volume and one tone control Versions There were six major versions of the Squier Stagemaster: V1 - Introduced in 1999 and featured a pick guard, top jack, reverse headstock, licensed Floyd Rose tremolo systems and 22 frets & 25.5\\" scale. Versions were HH, HSS, and HSH. V1 Stagemasters did not come from the factory in HHH or SSS versionsThe Squier history PDF published by Woodbright Video: http://www.woolbrightvideo.com/files/forums/SquierSpecs.pdf .https://web.archive.org/web/19991006012245/http://www.fender.com/news/squier_revamp.html Colors made were Black (506), Polar White (581), Cobalt Blue Metallic (587), Galactic Purple (591) and Frost Red (577). All V1 models were initially available with a natural wood color headstock; toward the later production months they were made with a matching painted headstock. All came with chrome hardware. Discontinued in March 2000. Very early versions had CY98xxxxxx serial numbers but were assembled in early 1999, not in 1998 per Fender Customer Service. V1 bodies & necks are interchangeable with Stratocaster guitars. The Floyd Rose tremolo uses a 37mm high tremolo bridge block held in with three 4mm screws. It uses a 6mm screw-in tremolo arm. The V1 can be converted to use genuine Floyd Rose 6mm screw-over or push-in tremolo arm types. Early V1 guitars have string tuners that are held in place with a set- screw (Type A). Later ones have tuners that are held in place with a recessed pin (Type B). V1 guitars were made in China. V1.0 Stagemasters are the original 1999 Stagemasters with tuners that have external screws to prevent tuner rotation. V1.1 Stagemasters are the 1999 Stagemasters with tuners that have an internal tuner pin to prevent tuner rotation. V1.2 Stagemasters are the 1999 Stagemasters that have matching painted headstocks. V2 & V2.7 - Introduced in 2000, discontinued 2002. Has a side jack, back-routed control cavity, reverse headstock, licensed Floyd Rose bridge, bolt-on 24 fret neck & 25.5\\" scale, and a locking nut. Six string versions were available in HH, HSS, and HSH pickup configurations. These 2-octave models were made in three colors: Black Metallic (565), Cobalt Blue Metallic (587), and Purple Metallic (593). The V2 six string model Floyd Rose tremolo uses a 37mm high tremolo bridge block held in with three 5mm screws. The V2 six string models can be converted to use genuine Floyd Rose 6mm screw-over or push-in tremolo arm types. The V2 models were also offered in HH pickup configuration in 7-string versions. The 7-string versions came in two models: a Floyd Rose bridge with locking nut (7FR) and a hard tail fixed bridge (7HT) with a regular nut. The 7-string models came in three colors: Black Metallic (565), Cobalt Blue Metallic (587) and Purple Metallic (593). The V2 7-string models are also depicted as V2.7 Stagemasters to distinguish them from the V2 six string models. The seven string Stagemaster can be converted to a HSH pickup configuration by a competent luthier. The V2.7 7-string guitars were discontinued on December 31, 2001. The V2.7 Floyd Rose tremolo uses a 34mm high x 70mm wide tremolo bridge block held in with three 4mm screws. All V2 guitars were made in China and came with black hardware. V3 - Introduced in January 2001, the Stagemaster HSS NLT (Non-Locking Tremolo) model number 032-2700 was the lowest priced Stagemaster sold listing for $349.99 (the street price was around $220 in 2001). Features a two-point bridge, back- routed control cavity, a bolt-on 22 fret neck 25.5\\" scale, and a regular type nut. Colors included Black Metallic (565), Cobalt Blue Metallic (587), and Purple Metallic (593). All came with chrome hardware. V3 bodies & necks are interchangeable with Telecaster guitars as it has a square neck pocket; Stratocaster necks will fit a V3 body but may have an exposed gap. The V3 guitars were made in China. V3 Stagemasters are the most common Stagemaster found today and sell for around $100 to $125 in 2019. The Stagemaster HSS NLT was renamed in January 2002 to the Showmaster HSS NLT with exactly the same features. The V3 Stagemaster uses a 35.6mm tall pot-metal Stratocaster type bridge block. Finding replacement steel or brass tremolo blocks is difficult as most Squire replacement blocks do not fit correctly. eBay vendor kevinh3324 does make steel or brass replacement blocks that correctly fits the Stagemaster HSS NLT. The V3 Stagemaster uses a 6mm screw-in tremolo arm. V4 - Introduced May 15, 2000, The Stagemaster Deluxe versions with neck-through construction were made alongside these models and were available in HH and HSH configurations. The necks are 24 fret & 25.5\\" scale. The Deluxe HH neck- through came in three colors: Shoreline Gold Metallic (544), Atlantic Blue Metallic (569), and Wine Red Metallic (575). The Deluxe HSH came in three different colors: Pewter Gray Metallic (543), Black Metallic (565), and Emerald Green Metallic (571). No HSS or SSS neck-through models were made. All V4 models came with black hardware and were made in Korea. The V4 Floyd Rose tremolo uses a 34mm high tremolo bridge block held in with 5mm screws. The V4 models can be converted to use genuine Floyd Rose 6mm screw-over or push-in tremolo arm types. V5 - In 2000 Squier made an exclusive run of six string Stagemasters for Mars Music. They came in HH configuration only and were available in three colors: Blueburst, Redburst, and Blackburst. A notable difference from the other Stagemasters is that they have regular headstocks that are not reversed. These guitars came with a bolt on 24 fret neck 25.5\\" scale, Licensed Floyd Rose tremolo bridge with a locking nut, black hardware, one vol/one tone knob, and a 3-way knife switch. These guitars are known as the \\"Mars Stagemasters\\" and are the only Stagemasters that have a burst finish. The V5 Stagemaster guitars were made in China. The V5 Floyd Rose tremolo uses a 34mm high tremolo bridge block held in with 5mm screws. The V5 models can be converted to use genuine Floyd Rose 6mm screw-over or push-in tremolo arm types. V6 - In January 2001 Squier introduced the Squire Sub-Sonic Deluxe baritone guitar as a part of the Stagemaster Series. It is a neck-thru design like the V4 models but has a hard-tail bridge and a normal nut. It is tuned a forth below a standard guitar: B1–E2–A2–D3–F♯3–B3 (low to high). The Sub-Sonic guitar was made in Korea. It was only available as a dual humbucker (HH) and came only in Black Metallic (565). The scale length is 27\\" and the neck has 24 frets. Controls are a 3-way pickup selector switch, a volume control, and a tone control. The V2 & V4 2nd generation 24-fret solid body Stagemasters featured many upgrades and were \\"designed to compete with guitars costing 4 to 5 times as much.\\" One upgrade was wax potted pickups stock with the guitar. Another upgrade was rear access electronics cavity allowing for a guitars without pick guards. The Deluxe models featured neck-through three- piece maple necks, while the standard models featured a bolt-on one-piece neck with no scarf joint, and a contoured heel. The reverse headstocks on the Stagemasters allow for completely straight string pull. Another nice feature is the inclusion of a brass bridge sustain block on the Ping licensed Floyd Rose bridge, unusual quality in a budget-priced guitar. In March 2002 the Stagemaster line was renamed to Showmaster due to a trademark claim from Kramer, who had made a guitar called the Stagemaster in the mid-late 1980s. V2, V3 and V4 model Stagemaster guitars are known to exist labelled as \\"Showmaster\\" (except for the V2 7 string guitars). All Stagemasters came with rosewood fret boards. None were ever made with maple fret boards. History The Stagemaster line of guitars were introduced in the 1st Quarter of 1999. The first 1999 Stagemaster looked like Fender Straocasters with a reverse headstock and the Stagemaster 22 fret necks are compatible with a Stratocaster. The V2 design of 2000 was of a super strat with a 24 fret neck that is NOT compatible with a Stratocaster. In 2001 Kramer sent Fender a letter stating that Fenders was using Kramer's trademark of \\"Stagemaster\\" for electric guitars and demanded that Fender stop using the Kramer trademark. Kramer had released a line of guitars from 1986 to 1990 that were branded as \\"Stagemaster\\" and had the trademark \\"Stagemaster\\". Fender agreed to stop using the trademark beginning January 1, 2002. The Squier \\"Stagemasters\\" were discontinued and some Stagemaster models (V2, V3, V4 & V6) were renamed \\"Showmaster\\" and were released on Jan 4th 2002. The 7 string Stagemaster models were discontinued and were not re-branded as Showmaster. There was never a lawsuit - Fender and Kramer worked the issue out between themselves and the case never went to court. The details of the settlement between Kramer and Fender were never revealed to the public. The Showmaster guitars were later discontinued in 2004 and were sold through 2005 until the stocks were depleted. Identification of the Stagemaster guitars is quite easy. If it has a normal head stock it is a V5 Mars Stagemaster. If it has seven strings it is a V2.7 model. If it has a pick guard it is a V1. If it has a back-routed control cavity and a bolt-on 24 fret neck it is a V2. If it has back-routed control cavity and a bolt-on 22 fret neck it is a V3. If it is a neck-through guitar with a 25.5\\" scale and has a Floyd Rose bridge it is V4. If it is a neck- through guitar, the neck scale is 27\\", and it has a hard tail bridge it is a V6 baritone. The Stagemaster guitar shares similarities with the Heavy Metal (HM) Strat which was produced by Fender and discontinued in 1992. It also shares similarities with the Squier Heavy Metal (HM) guitars made from 1989 to 1993.

Deacon was employed by the fashion houses Bottega Veneta and Gucci, before founding his own label, GILES, in 2003. He launched his first collection for GILES at the 2004 London Fashion Week and was named \\"Best New Designer\\" at the British Fashion Awards. Deacon's designs have been met with critical acclaim and have sparked a renewed interest in London fashion. Having become one of the fashion industry's most fêted figures, Deacon was named British Fashion Designer of the Year in 2006 and was awarded the French ANDAM Fashion Award's Grand Prix in 2009. The designer was appointed creative director of French fashion house Ungaro in April 2010. Deacon retained the position until September 2011, when he and Ungaro mutually decided to end their collaboration. Deacon launched his first haute couture collection in 2016. Early life Deacon was born in Darlington, County Durham, but grew up near Ullswater in the Lake District. Deacon is the youngest child of David, an agricultural salesman, and Judith, a housewife. He has one older sister. He attended Barnard Castle School in County Durham which he credits with instilling in him \\"the mindset of aesthetics\\".

He later joined Harrogate College of Arts, where he completed an art foundation course. After completing his course he went on to study at Central St Martins and was in the same class as fashion designers Alexander McQueen and Luella Bartley. He graduated in 1992 and began collaborating on the label 'Doran Deacon' with his friend, Fi Doran as well as contributing illustrations to Dazed & Confused. Career Deacon chose to travel and gain experiences at fashion houses, before starting his own label. During his time in Paris, Deacon was hired to work with fashion designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, where he learnt how to use a brand name commercially. During this time, Deacon met the owner of Italian luxury goods house, Bottega Veneta, and was hired to work for the company, becoming the head designer and debuting a much acclaimed collection in 2000. Deacon was dismissed in 2001 when the Gucci group bought the company and terminated his contract, so they could hire German designer, Tomas Maier. However, he was immediately hired by Tom Ford to assist with Gucci womenswear. Deacon was forced to leave Gucci after one season when he became ill from an infected salivary gland. Once he had recovered, Deacon decided to take out a loan to start his own label and he launched GILES in 2003. He launched his first collection at London Fashion Week in February 2004, styled by his friend Katie Grand, the show saw models Karen Elson, Lily Cole, Eva Herzigova and Linda Evangelista walking the catwalk. The collection received international acclaim and began a renewed interest in London fashion. Deacon regularly showed at London Fashion Week and the GILES collection is bought by over thirty retail stores including Barneys, Harvey Nichols and Selfridges. Deacon counted Thandie Newton, Princess Beatrice and Scarlett Johansson among his clients. Several actresses, including Cate Blanchett and Kerry Washington, have worn Deacon's dresses at red carpet events. In 2009, Deacon stated that since he launched his label, he has seen the turnover double every year and sales increased during the recession. His studio is at the Truman Brewery in East London. In April 2010, it was announced that Deacon had been appointed the creative director position with French fashion house Ungaro, following the dismissal of Estrella Archs. Deacon became the fifth designer to be hired by the house since the it was sold to entrepreneur Asim Abdullah in 2005. On 19 September 2010, Deacon made a return to London Fashion Week, after spending two years showing his collection in Paris. Deacon showed his first collection for Ungaro in October 2010. Vogue previewed the new collection, which was designed by Deacon, styled by Grand and accessorised by Katie Hillier and Stephen Jones, on their website. Vogue reporter, Dolly Jones, described the collection as one of the \\"most hotly anticipated shows\\" of the week and she added \\"[Deacon] looks like he'll be credited with bringing the house of Ungaro back to life, at last.\\" From June 2011, Deacon took part in the Channel 4 entertainment series, New Look Style the Nation. The designer joined New Look's creative director Barbara Horspool on a panel tasked with finding an \\"exceptional new fashion stylist\\" from contestants, who demonstrate good creativity and style. The winner was to be hired by New Look as a stylist. Deacon previously appeared on Britain's Next Top Model as a judge. On 15 September, it was announced Ungaro and Deacon had \\"mutually decided\\" to end their collaboration. In 2013, Deacon presented the first ever fashion exhibition at the William Morris Gallery in London. After deciding to put his ready-to-wear line on hiatus, Deacon launched his first haute couture collection in 2016. He told Steff Yotka of Vogue that he had always wanted to create more couture pieces, and that he chose to concentrate on high end fashion after realising that the pieces he and his team had produced were selling well. He designed the wedding dress of Pippa Middleton, sister of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, in May 2017. =Style= Deacon has been known to challenge the traditional ideas of womenswear and often uses wild prints and pop culture references in his designs. He has described his designs for GILES as humorous, dark and sexy and has stated that he wants diversity in among them. He said, \\"My dresses should be worn by young, cool girls just as much as by 55 to 60 year old women\\". Deacon often designs \\"structured big- entrance\\" dresses, which are aimed at women who want to be noticed. At the 2008 London Fashion Week, Deacon presented a collection with a futuristic theme based on the 1980s arcade game Pac-Man. The character was embellished on many of the dresses and the models wore oversized helmets in the shape of Pac- Man. The designer's New Look menswear collections have been described by GQ magazine as \\"straddling the line between quirky and wearable\\". Susannah Frankel of The Independent has said that Deacon's collections are \\"a much- needed injection of grand-scale glamour\\". Frankel added that a playfulness and humour have also found their way into Deacon's collections. In May 2011, Deacon said he does not design for wallflowers and that his collections would always be a \\"little bit sideways\\", \\"quirky\\" and \\"British in feel.\\" The Scotsman said Deacon's designs are not brash, but \\"they suit a woman who has the confidence to take centre-stage.\\" =Collaborations= Deacon has worked on many collaborations with companies including Sky, Converse and Evoke, with whom he created his first jewellery collection. In a two-season collaboration with British fashion company Mulberry, Deacon introduced a line of accessories called \\"Mulberry for Giles\\", which was both a commercial and critical success. Deacon was then appointed to design for the classic British tailoring label, Daks. He showed his first and second collections for the brand in 2007 and his third in 2008. Deacon's best known collaboration has been with the High Street fashion chain New Look. The collection called Gold by Giles began in March 2007. On choosing to collaborate with the clothing retailer, Deacon said: \\"I chose New Look as the high street store to work with, as we both have a sense of fun and believe in fashion for everyone.\\"\\" Actress Drew Barrymore starred in the first ad campaigns for the collection, following a chance meeting between her and the designer in a lift. British model, Agyness Deyn took over and modelled the key pieces for Deacon's 4th collection. In late 2015, Deacon designed a womenswear collection for Debenhams. The collection titled Giles Deacon for Edition was modelled by Daisy Lowe and featured \\"beautiful dresses, bold prints and luxe outerwear\\". Recognition In 2004, Deacon was named 'Best New Designer' at the British Fashion Awards and in the following year he was given the Young Designer Award at Elle magazine's Style Awards. 2006 saw Deacon win the British Fashion Council's Fashion Forward Award, as well as being named British Fashion Designer of the Year at the British Fashion Awards. He was named Best British Designer at the 2007 Elle Style Awards. Two years later, Deacon won the French ANDAM Fashion Award's Grand Prix, becoming the second consecutive British designer to win the award following Gareth Pugh's win in 2008. In the same year, he was named GQ magazine's Designer of the Year. Personal life Deacon divides his time between his home in Islington, London, and his apartments in Paris and Italy. He has been in a relationship with actress Gwendoline Christie since early 2013. Deacon's hobbies include swimming, hiking and gardening. He counts Elsa Schiaparelli, Miuccia Prada, Coco Chanel, Mr J.M. Millet, and Yves Saint Laurent among his design and style inspirations.

Mini-macaws are a loosely defined group of small-to-medium-sized macaw species within the tribe Arini. The term has no fixed taxonomic meaning and is principally used in aviculture to describe a small macaw belonging to one of a number of different genera, with overall length being the sole criterion for inclusion. Any macaw with an overall length (including the tail) of less than about 50 cm (20 inches) can be described as a \\"mini-macaw\\".

Walters has been a professor of Zoology and Fisheries at the University of British Columbia since 1969. He is one of the main developers of the ecological modelling software Ecopath.http://www.ecopath.org/ His most recent work focuses on how to adjust human behaviors in environments that are full of uncertainty. He is a recent recipient of the Volvo Environment Prize (2006).http://www.environment- prize.com/ In 2019, Dr. Walters became a Member of the Order of British Columbia.  Education  Carl Walters graduated from Bakersfield College with an A.A in 1963 and continued to Humboldt State College to graduate with a B.S. in 1965. After Walters graduated, he went to Colorado State University to study the \\"Distribution and production of midges in an alpine lake\\" under the advisement of Dr. Robert E. Vincent. After obtaining his M.S. in 1967, Walters stayed on with R.E. Vincent to get his doctorate on the \\"Effects of fish introduction on invertebrate fauna of an alpine lake\\" and graduated in 1969. Walters did not go on for a postdoctoral position; instead he almost immediately started working at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Career Walters's first professorship was at the University of British Columbia as an Assistant Professor in the UBC, Walters worked for the California Department of Fish and Game and was also a graduate fellow, a consultant, and an aide on numerous occasions. He has taken sabbaticals to the International Institute of Applied Systems Analysis in Vienna, the University of Florida, where he is an adjunct professor, and Australia. He has been on the editorial board for multiple journals including the Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences, Conservation Ecology, and Ecosystems and has been the associate editor of the Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computation and the Northwest Environmental Journal. He was the editor of the Open Fish Science Journal. Walters also served, and continues to serve, as a consultant to many government agencies. Interests Walters uses mathematical modeling to understand how to successfully manage harvestable fisheries in a time of high uncertainty. He specializes in fisheries stock assessments (e.g cod, salmon, anchoveta), adaptive management strategies, and ecosystem modeling.Walters C.J. and McGuire J.J. 1996. Lessons for stock assessment from the northern cod collapse. Rev. Fish. Biol. Fisheries 6:125-137Melnychuk M.C., Welch D.W., Walters C.J., and Christensen V. 2007. Riverine and early ocean migration and mortality patterns of juvenile steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) from the Cheakamus River, British Columbia. Hydrobiologia. 582: 55-65. One of his goals has been, and continues to be, to try to bridge the gap between fisheries management, government, and fishing industries in order to provide accurate information to use in successfully and actively managing fisheries. His work in modeling population dynamics and active adaptive management has made Walters a valuable member of the scientific community. ContributionsForaging Arena Theory= Other modeling equations like the Beverton-Holt model and the \\"hockey stick\\" model by Barrowman and Myers (2000) try to explain density dependent effects of juvenile fish populations using processes like recruitment and the number of eggs produced.Barrowman N.J. and Myers R.A. 2000. Still more spawner-recRuitment curves: the hockey stick and its generalizations. Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 57: 665-676.Walters C.J. and Juanes F. 1993. Recruitment limitation as a consequence of optimal risk-taking behaviour by juvenile fish. Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 50:2058-2070.Walters CJ and Martell S (2004) Fisheries Ecology and Management. Princeton, New Jersey, Princeton University Press. Fisheries biologists and population ecologists have used the Beverton-Holt model since the 1960s to describe the \\"stock- recruitment\\" relationship. However, Walters believed that juvenile behavior could also explain the density dependent relationship that Beverton and Holt and Barrowman and Myers described. Walters thought that juvenile behavior, in conjunction with habitat, could explain the density dependency seen when foraging for prey and avoiding predators.Walters C.J. and Juanes F. 1993. Recruitment limitation as a consequence of optimal risk-taking behaviour by juvenile fish. Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 50:2058-2070. Walters wanted to give scientists a better understanding of the processes that drive density dependent fluctuations in ecosystem statistics (birth and death rates). The foraging arena theory is also used, in conjunction with the ecosystem simulation program Ecopath with Ecosim, to account for the indirect effects and trophic cascades seen in populations. =Adaptive management= One of Walters biggest concerns in the rapidly changing environment is how managers can successfully manage fisheries stocks in lieu of the uncertainty in making decisions. His concept of active adaptive management involves large-scale experimentation, or \\"learning-by-doing\\", in order to understand the population dynamics in fish communities and to aide in the decision-making process done by policy makers.Walters, C.J. 1987. Adaptive policy design for fisheries management: active versus passive policies. In L.W. Botsford [Ed.], Perspectives on Applied Ecology. U. Calif. Press, Davis. Walters encourages other scientists, managers, and policy makers to embrace the uncertainty in experiments and decisions and to develop ecosystem models based on the uncertainties in order to make multiple hypotheses instead of just one hypothesis. Although active adaptive management has gained much support from the scientific community, there is still great hesitation from scientists and managers to implement these large-scale experiments.Hilborn, R. and Walters C.J. 1991. Quantitative Fisheries Stock Assessment and Management. Chapman- Hall, Pub. Co., New York, USA. (580 pp)Walters, C. 2007. Is adaptive management helping to solve fisheries problems? Ambio. 36:304-307. These hesitations arise from large monetary costs for the experiments as well as the monitoring of the experiments, lack of an individual willing to take on the daunting task of organizing the experiments, the limitations of models to perfectly represent an ecosystem, and the conflicting ecological values between different interest groups. Although there are concerns when executing active adaptive management strategies, there is a growing need to modify the current methods for exploring and understanding ecosystems, especially on a larger scale, and active adaptive management strategies aim to do exactly that.

It is considered a classic piece of climbing literature, known to many climbers as simply \\"The Book\\", and has served as an inspiration for more recent climbing books, such as Mark Kroese's Fifty Favorite Climbs. Though much of the book's contents are now out of date, it is still recognized as a definitive text which goes beyond the traditional guidebook. The first edition was published in 1979, by Sierra Club Books in the United States and in Great Britain by the now defunct Diadem Books. This was followed by a paperback printing by Random House in 1981. Two subsequent editions (with the same content) were published by Sierra Club Books in 1982 and 1996. Between 1979 and 1999 it sold nearly thirty thousand copies, a considerable achievement for a climbing guide book. Reviewing the book in American Alpine Journal, Fred Beckey wrote: \\"Roper and Steck have presented a profile of what could be considered the Great American Dream climbs with a writing style that provides much Lebensraum for speculation and meditation. While reading, one is tempted to meditate: the challenge of the alpine adventure is always there; the dreams of the various pioneers sometimes filter through the narrative.\\" Roper and Steck received the American Alpine Club's 1995 Literary Award for the book and for their other works such as The Best of Ascent. To choose the list of climbs, the coauthors solicited opinions from a number of leading climbers of the era, narrowing a list of more than 100 climbs according to three basic criteria: that the peak or route appear striking from afar, have a noteworthy climbing history, and offer climbing of excellent quality. Precedence was given to climbing quality over appearance, and appearance over historical significance. In order to judge historical significance and continuing popularity, routes were limited for the most part to those first ascended before 1970. A lower limit on the length of the route, at 500 feet, was also established. Steck and Roper had personally ascended or attempted most of the selected routes.Fifty Classic Climbs, \\"Introduction\\", pp. ix-xi The list of fifty climbs has served as a challenge to climbers, providing them with a \\"tick list\\" of challenging routes that span a wide section of western North America. Author Steve Roper has emphasized that the climbs were chosen from a list of about 120 climbs he and Steck considered classic, and are simply '50 classic climbs', not 'the 50 classics'. Nevertheless, the book brought great popularity to many of the routes it featured, and prospective climbers pursuing one of the \\"fifty classics\\" often found crowds on the more accessible climbs and unexpected company on the more remote routes, earning them the nickname \\"Fifty Crowded Climbs\\". No one person has yet climbed all fifty routes. This has been attributed to the difficulty of some of the Alaskan and Canadian routes (the Hummingbird Ridge of Mount Logan has never been repeated by the original route).  The Fifty Classics  The fifty climbs included in the book are listed below, along with their grades as given in the first edition, which may differ from those found in a modern guidebook due to changes in climbing standards or route conditions. = Alaska and the Yukon  Western Canada  Washington  Wyoming  Colorado  Utah & New Mexico  California = References  Category:Climbing books Category:Mountaineering books Category:1979 non-fiction books ","title":"Fifty Classic Climbs of North America"},{"id":"20802247","text":"Olé, Olé is the third studio album by French-Algerian singer Rachid Taha.

His nine-year career included one full season and parts of four others in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago White Sox (1954), Chicago Cubs (1956–57), Cleveland Indians (1957), Detroit Tigers (1958), and Washington Senators (1958–59). The right-hander was listed as tall and . Valentinetti was born in West New York, New Jersey. A graduate of Iona College, Valentinetti entered pro baseball in 1950 in the White Sox system, and missed two seasons (1952–53) while serving in the military during the Korean War. Valentinetti made only one appearance for the MLB White Sox, his debut on June 20, 1954, when he surrendered six runs on four hits and two bases on balls in one inning a 16–6 loss to the New York Yankees. Sent back to the minor leagues, he was acquired by the cross-town Cubs in the 1955 Rule 5 Draft. Valentinetti spent the entire 1956 campaign with Cubs, working in 42 games, 40 in relief, and posting a 6–4 win–loss record, a 3.78 earned run average and one save. The following season, however, he began to bounce around: between 1957 and 1960, he was a member of four MLB teams, five minor league clubs and seven different organizations. Although he spent part of 1958 in the minors, he pitched in 38 MLB games that season for Detroit and Washington. He made ten starts for the Senators, and notched two complete games. After only seven games in 1959, however, Valentinetti was sent back to the minors at the May cutdown, and he finished his active career in Triple-A in 1960. In 108 MLB games, including 15 starts, and 257 innings pitched, Valentinetti allowed 266 hits and 122 walks, with 96 strikeouts, three complete games and three saves.

Emissions per capita for Australia are still well above the OECD, and developed world average, with most sources pointing to 22-25 tons. Australia uses principally coal power (70%) for electricity but this is decreasing with a growing share of renewables making up the energy supply mix. Emissions by the country have started to fall and are expected to continue to fall in coming years as more projects come online.  Total contribution  The Australian government estimates that Australia's net emissions in 2017 were 556.4 million tonnes -equivalent, to which the sectoral contributions were approximately as follows: electricity, 33%; transport, 18%; stationary energy (excluding electricity), 17%; agriculture, 13%; fugitive emissions, 10%; industrial processes, 6%; waste, 3%. This includes about 13% for non-electricity residential use. Of the 190 million tons emitted for Electricity in 2017, 20 million tons was for primary industry, 49 million tones for manufacturing (which might include aluminum smelting), 51 million tons Commercial, Construction and Transport, and 33 million tons Residential.  Cumulative historical contribution  The World Resources Institute estimates that Australia was responsible for 1.1% of all CO2 emissions between 1850 and 2002.Navigating the Numbers: Greenhouse Gas Data and International Climate Policy, Chapter 6, Figure 6.1. This is about 3 times larger than Australia's share of global population, roughly a third of a percent as of 2013.  Projected contribution  According to the no-mitigation scenario in the Garnaut Climate Change Review, Australia's share of world emissions, at 1.5% in 2005, declines to 1.1% by 2030, and to 1% by 2100.Garnaut Climate Change Review, Chapter 3, Table 3.2.  Analysis of Australia's emissions  Some of the reasons for Australia's high levels of emissions include:- * Australia smelts Aluminium, which is then exported and used elsewhere. This accounts for some 15% of electricity consumed. * Australia has no nuclear power, very limited hydro electricity (4%), and minimal geothermal opportunities. 60% of electricity comes from coal,https://www.industry.gov.au/data-and- publications/resources-and-energy-quarterly-september-2019 and 15% from gas. * A warm climate results in high use of air conditioning but limited needs for heating. * The effect of agriculture. * High levels of automobile and aeroplane use among the population. * Continued deforestation.  Measuring production vs consumption of carbon products  The import and export of goods confounds equitable measurements of emissions, particularly in the context of endeavouring to reach a global agreement on emissions reduction based on contraction and convergence. Australian emissions are monitored on a production rather than a consumption basis. This means that the emissions from the manufacture of goods imported into and consumed within Australia, for example many motor vehicles, are allocated to the country of manufacture. Similarly, Australia produces aluminium for export which requires substantial amounts of electricity which is produced by greenhouse gas emitting coal-fired power stations. While the aluminium is mainly consumed overseas, the emissions of its production are allocated to Australia.  Coal Exports  In 2018 Australia was the world's 2nd largest exporter of coal.  LNG Exports  Australia was estimated to be (not yet officially confirmed) the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas in 2019.  Mitigation  Politics  In the late 1980s and early 1990s there was clear Australian consensus about the need for action on climate change between the two major political parties. However following the 1991 recession incoming right wing governments began framing science of climate change as a continuing debate. In 1997 Australia joined the United States as the only countries to not ratify the Kyoto Protocol. With voters influenced by events like the Millennium drought and 2006s film An Inconvenient Truth both parties went to the 2007 election promising action on climate change, with the then opposition calling climate change the \\"greatest moral, economic and social challenge of our time\\". The incumbent Howard government lost, and the incoming Labor government immediately ratified the Kyoto Protocol. In 2009 before a bill could be passed, with the support of opposition leader Malcolm Turnbull, the opposition changed leaders to Tony Abbott, and supported by The Greens but for the opposite reason that Rudd's scheme was too weak and potentially locked in failure, blocked Rudd's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. In 2010 the Rudd government decided to delay the implementation of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) until the end of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (ending in 2012). They cited the lack of bipartisan support for the CPRS and slow international progress on climate action as the reasons for the decision. In turn the delay was strongly criticised by the Federal Opposition as well as community and grassroots action groups such as GetUp. Following the unsuccessful Copenhagen Summit the Rudd was replaced by Gillard as Prime Minister, who stated that \\"there will be no 'carbon tax' under the government I lead\\". In 2012 the Gillard Labor government introduced Carbon pricing in Australia, which became colloquially known as a 'carbon tax'. It required large businesses, defined as those emitting over 25,000 tons ofcarbon dioxide equivalent annually, to purchase emissions permits. The strong backlash lead by opposition leader Abbott led to her being replaced as leader by Rudd, then Abbott at the next election. Under his leadership, Australia became the first country to repeal a carbon pricing program. In 2015 Abbott was replaced as Prime Minister by Turnbull under the condition that his climate policy would not change. Australia attended the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference and adopted the Paris Agreement. In limiting further action on climate change Australia joins Russia, Turkey and Brazil in citing US President Trump's promise to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. In 2018, Turnbull was replaced by Scott Morrison as leader of the Liberal party. Morrison won the 2019 election with an unchanged climate policy.

Originally known as the Australian Industry InnovationXchange Network, its aim was to provide an open network for improved communication across industry, government, universities and the community. In 2004 the InnovationXchange (IXC) undertook a pilot with John Wolpert to test the concept of using 'trusted intermediaries' i.e. facilitating confidential exchange of sensitive information. The pilot demonstrated that often organisations do not understand why external parties might value their capabilities. Further, they may not have assessed their capabilities and/or considered partnerships. This pilot was supported by the Commonwealth and Victorian governments. This pilot was deemed a success and in 2006, the University of Birmingham licensed the InnovationXchange model in the UK. As a publicly available example of the services IXC provide (as most work is highly confidential), in 2010 the company 'matched' Jaguar Land Rover and with Bladon Jets, innovators of micro gas turbines.

Carey (born 1942) is an American psychologist. She is a Professor of Psychology at Harvard University. She is an expert in language acquisition and children's development of biological concepts and is known for introducing the concept of fast mapping, whereby children learn the meanings of words after a single exposure.Susan Carey Profile, Association for Psychological Science. http://www.psychologicalscience.org/awards/james/citations/carey.cfm Her research focuses on analyzing philosophical concepts, and conceptual changes in science over time. She has conducted experiments on infants, toddlers, adults, and non-human primates. Biography She was born in 1942. Her parents were William and Mary. Later, her father remarried to a woman, Joan, who currently lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Carey's studies focus on the development of children and adults and the cultural construction of concepts over time. Carey received a B.A. from Radcliffe College in 1964, a Fulbright scholarship to study in University of London in 1965, and a Ph.D. in Experimental psychology from Harvard University in 1971. She was employed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1972 to 1996 in the Psychology Department of Brain and Cognitive development and New York University from 1996 to 2001 before she joined the faculty at Harvard University in 2001. On returning to Harvard, Carey began working alongside Elizabeth Spelke, and they started a Developmental Studies lab. Carey also studied alongside George Miller, Jerome Butler, and Roger Brown. She conducted experiments on infants, toddlers, adults, and non-human primates. Carey coined the term \\"Quinian bootstrapping,\\" a bootstrapping process that historians and philosophers look at on conceptual change. Carey is a member of the American Philosophical Society, National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Educational Sciences of Ukraine, and the British Academy. Her research analyzes philosophical concepts, and conceptual changes in science over time. She was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2001. Carey is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and has received many academic awards and distinctions, including the Jean Nicod Prize for philosophy of mind in 1998. She was the first woman to receive the Rumelhart Prize, in 2009, which has been given annually since 2001 for significant contributions to the theoretical foundation of human cognition. She is married to the professor of philosophy Ned Block (NYU). Carey authored Conceptual Change in Childhood, which reconciles Piaget's work on animism with later work on children's knowledge of biological concepts. She also authored The Origin of Concepts for which she won the 2010 Eleanor Maccoby Book Award from the American Psychological Association. Career When Susan Carey began her career she served on a few Editorial Boards. Some of the boards she was on were for the Psychological Review, Psychological Science, Journal of Acquisition, and Development Psychology. Susan Carey and Elsa Bartlett were at Harvard University when they created the term \\"Fast mapping\\" in 1978. This term refers to the hypothesized mental process where a new concept is learned only based on a single exposure. Susan Carey wrote a book during her career as a psychologist, which was called Conceptual Change in Childhood. This book was about the cognitive differences between children and adults. It is a case study about children's acquisition of biological knowledge and analyzes the ways the knowledge is restructured during the development. Susan Carey wrote another book called \\"the Origin of Concepts\\" which shows the basis of development of cognitive science. In her professional experience she started out as an assistant professor at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) between 1972 and 1977. She then went to an associate professor at MIT in 1977 to 1984. Instead of being in the psychology department in 1984 she became a professor in the MIT's department of brain and cognitive sciences until 1996. She was a professor at NYU (New York University) for the department of psychology from 1996 to 2001, after her career at NYU she had moved to Harvard and is still currently teaching. Awards Susan Carey has received many fellowships and honors. These fellowships and honors include: Radcliff Institute Fellowship (1976-1978), Sloane Fellow (1980-1981), Fellow: Institute for Advanced Studies in the Behavioral Sciences (1984-1985), Cattell Fellowship (1995-1996), Nicod Prize (1998), Society of Cognitive Neuroscience, George A Miller Lecturer (1998), Guggenheim Fellowship (1999-2000), National Academy of Education (1999), Society for Experimental Psychology (1999), American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2001), William James Fellow, American Psychology Society (2002), The British Academy, Corresponding Fellow (2007), David E.

Alternatives to Script Command One of the problems with the script command is that it only allows logging of a child process; and often there is a need to log the command in the current process without spawning a new process, such as when automation of a script is needed that can log its own output. The Unix operating systems make this possible by use of pipes and redirects. Consider the following model examples: =Bourne shell= All shells related to Bourne shell (namely: sh, bash, and ksh) allow the stdout and stderr to be attached to a named pipe and redirected to the tee command. Example LOGNAME=\\"script\\" rm -f $LOGNAME.p $LOGNAME.log mknod $LOGNAME.p p tee <$LOGNAME.p $LOGNAME.log & exec >$LOGNAME.p 2>&1 The above script records to all output of the command. However, some interactive programs (such as python) do not echo their standard input when run under the resulting shell, although they do when run under the script command, again due to the detection of a terminal.

Biography  Kakabadze was born in 1982 .ContributorIrakli Kakabadze In his early youth (1987–1990) Irakli Kakabadze was actively involved in the anti-Soviet dissident movement and participated in the National Liberation movement of Georgia. By 1989 he was the youngest member of the National Liberation Committee formed by the first President of Georgia, Zviad Gamsakhurdia. In 1990, at the age of 21 he was elected to the National Forum of Georgia, which included the nine strongest political parties there. Kakabadze was not eligible to run due to his age, but he helped the liberation movement to win October 1990 elections by a wide margin. After the election of Zviad Gamsakhurdia as Georgia's President, Kakabadze quit his political activities and dedicated himself to literature and arts. He moved to the United States in 1990 and then adopted a bilingual writing style. Kakabadze also works in the field of peace studies and conflict resolution. He has been a practitioner of nonviolent social change and conflict resolution for nearly two decades. He was an active participant of two peaceful revolutions in 1989 (as one of the leaders of student movement) and in 2003 (as one of the leaders of civil disobedience committee). During his work as peace and human rights activist in 1988-2010, Kakabadze was arrested and assaulted a number of times by the Soviet and Georgian police. From 1997 to 2002 he worked as a coordinator for Institute for Multi-Track Diplomacy in Washington, DC.

His play “Candidate Jokola” was controversial in Georgia, as it was about a love story between a Georgian presidential candidate and an Abkhaz woman. SHMAZI Transformative Performance style The word Shmazi was born in the mid-1990s while Kakabadze was studying at George Mason University in Virginia, USA. Kakabadze integrated performance and conflict resolution sessions in 1997 together with Daniel McFarland and KP- Funk Band. “Shmazi” style of performing art combines performance with facilitated problem-solving workshops. In 1998-99 he took part in Shmazi performances together with American authors, including Yana Djin, Quique Aviles, singer Luci Murphy and musicians Allison Wolfe, and Natalie Avery. Initially, Shmazi events were directed mostly against the bourgeois gentrification policies in the Mount Pleasant neighborhood of Washington, DC. Shmazi became synonymous with political performing arts, challenging the economic order of class domination. But at the same time Kakabadze and his colleagues were facilitating conflict transformation through artistic performances. After returning to Georgia Kakabadze started to collaborate with one of the leading composers of electronic music Gogi Dzodzuashvili. Dzodzuashvili and Kakabadze created the well-known electronic song “Postindustrial Boys” - one of the popular songs in Europe. Kakabadze developed Polyphonic Discourse that included differing narratives in the same artistic piece. “Tbilisi at the End of 20th” century was one of the first Shmazi performances, featuring multiple narratives. In 2003 Kakabadze together with Giorgi Sikharulidze created “Theater for Change” based on Augusto Boal’s facilitation technique. This time the goal was to contribute to social change through artistic action. The work of this theater under the leadership of Giorgi Sikharulidze and Irakli Kakabadze contributed significantly to the non- violent “Rose Revolution’ in November, 2003. Kakabadze has taught this method for years in different universities, including at Cornell University. Polyphonic Discourse Irakli Kakabadze was an Editor-in-Chief of the bi- lingual (Georgian-English) literary-social science magazine “Peace Times” in 2001-2004 in Tbilisi, Georgia. This is where he started to explore multi- lingual and multi-discourse style of writing. The magazine combined the discourse of creative multi-media art with multi-disciplinary peace science. It was at this journal that Kakabadze started to publish Georgian, Russian, English and German texts. Polyphonic discourse as a method originates from traditional Georgian folk music and from the writings of Russian literary scientist Mikhail Bakhtin. Together with his colleague Zurab Rtveliashvili, Kakabadze has used this technique to bring it to writing and performance – articulating different narratives at the same time. In their joint works “The Georgian Humanist Manifesto of 21st Century” (2005) and “Contemporary Dada Manifesto” (2009) they have shown two distinctly different narratives coexisting in the same performance while not breaking up it harmony. A decentralized style of performance and artistic delivery became a signature style of these artists. Many critics connected these polyphonic performances with the advance of multicultural postmodern narrative in the West – but according to authors, this concept has its roots far deeper than simple trend on early 21st century. In May 2008 Kakabadze shared a stage at PEN World Voices Festival in New York with György Dragomán, Hasan Elahi, Asli Erdogan, Péter Esterházy, Chenjerai Hove, Jenny Marketou, Ivy Meeropol, Francine Prose, and Ingo Schulze, at the Writers and Artists Against the Surveillance State.[20] In November 2008 at the Miami Book Fair Kakabadze shared a stage with Sarah Mkhonza, Russell Banks and Derek Walcott to perform another piece of Polyphonic Blues.[21] Kakabadze has performed his polyphonic style of poetry at the Frankfurt Book Fair (2009) and “Free the Word” in London (2010) (23). At the 2010 “PEN World Voices” Festival in New York Kakabadze performed Polyphonic Discourse at the Cabaret Show that featured the author with Natalie Merchant, Ben Okri and Ariel Dorfman.

It is characterized by cardiac arrhythmia, or irregular beating of the heart, caused by abnormal conduction from or through the atrioventricular node (AV node). In newborns and infants up to 6 weeks old, the disease may also be referred to as His bundle tachycardia or congenital JET. Pathophysiology In normal individuals, electrical activity in the heart is initiated in the sinoatrial (SA) node (located in the right atrium), propagates to the atrioventricular (AV) node, and then through the bundle of His to the ventricles of the heart. (See electrical conduction system of the heart). The AV node acts as a gatekeeper, limiting the electrical activity that reaches the ventricles of the heart. This function of the AV node is important, because if the signals generated in the atria of the heart were to increase in rate (as they do during atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter), the AV node will limit the electrical activity that conducts to the ventricles. For instance, if the atria are electrically activated at 300 beats per minute, half those electrical impulses are blocked by the AV node, so that the ventricles are activated at 150 beats per minute (giving a pulse of 150 beats per minute). Another important property of the AV node is that it slows down individual electrical impulses. This is manifest on the ECG as the PR interval, which is about less than 200 milliseconds, the time from activation of the atria (manifest as the P wave) and activation of the ventricles (manifest as the QRS complex). Individuals with JET have a \\"short-circuit\\" in their heart, where the electricity bypasses the AV node, causing the heart to beat faster than normal. The cause of the arrhythmia, the ectopic focus, is usually near the AV node in the triangle of Koch (a rough triangle with points at the coronary sinus, the tendon of Todaro, and the tricuspid valve). Patients of heart surgery may experience an accelerated narrow complex tachycardia, usually within the first 24–48 hours (but occasionally longer) after surgery. There may be atrio-ventricular disassociation with more ventricular signals than atrial signals. The cause of JET is felt to be due to manipulation of the tissue surrounding the AV node during surgery, however debate exists regarding the exact cause, as it is seen after procedures even without significant manipulation of this area. JET-like symptoms can also manifest congenitally and in the first six months of life. This syndrome, which may also referred to as His bundle tachycardia, is resistant to therapy and can be difficult to treat.  Diagnosis  JET in a 2-month-old girl following cardiac surgery. In this case the right bundle branch block was present during tachycardia and during normal sinus rhythm. JET is most commonly diagnosed using a 12-lead ECG. The appearance is usually of a tachycardia with rapid, regular ventricular rates of 170-260 beats per minute. The QRS complexes are usually narrow, but may be broad if a bundle branch block is present. There may a 1:1 relationship between atria and ventricular activity with a short RP interval, or atrioventricular dissociation with slower atrial than ventricular rates if the AV node is unable to conduct from the ventricles to the atria. The differential diagnosis of JET includes other forms of supraventricular tachycardia, most commonly atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). These can be distinguished using adenosine. The response to adenosine in JET is a temporary loss of conduction to the atria leading to continuation of the tachycardia but with atrioventricular dissociation. In contrast, administration of adenosine in AVNRT will usually terminate the arrhythmia. The diagnosis can be conclusively proven by performing an invasive electrophysiological study. Treatment Treatment is aimed at slowing the rate by correcting acidosis, correcting electrolytes (especially magnesium and calcium), cooling the patient, and antiarrhythmic medications. Occasionally pacing of the atrium at a rate higher than the JET may allow improved cardiac function by allowing atrial and ventricular synchrony. Medications used to treat JET include beta-adrenoceptor blockers such as propranolol, calcium channel antagonists such as verapamil, and antiarrhythmics such as flecainide, amiodarone, and propafenone. Amiodarone is frequently used in the short term in children experiencing JET following heart surgery, although propanolol, flecainide and propafenone are more commonly recommended for long term use due to the frequency of side effects associated with amiodarone. In those who experience recurrent episodes of JET, an alternative to long term medical therapy is catheter ablation. In this procedure, the small area in which the cells initiating JET are found can be destroyed by heating or freezing the tissue. This is accomplished using wires passed to the heart via the femoral vein through a small puncture in the groin. The main risk of this procedure is accidental damage to the AV node. This occurs more frequently when treating JET than other forms of supraventricular tachycardia, requiring treatment with a pacemaker in 5-10% of ablations for JET. The risk is lower if the tissue is frozen rather than heated. For those at risk of developing JET such as children undergoing heart surgery, treatment can also be given prophylactically. A meta-analysis of 9 studies found that sedation with dexmedetomidine reduced the risk of JET occurring post-operatively.  Epidemiology  JET is most commonly seen in children following cardiac surgery. The arrhythmia affects 2-22% of children depending on the type of surgery performed, with higher rates seen following repair of Tetralogy of Fallot, and lower rates following the repair of ventricular septal defects and arterial switch operations. Etymology Junctional ectopic tachycardia derives its name from the problem it causes. \\"Junctional\\" is used as the abnormal tissue driving the ventricular rate is located close junction between the atria and ventricles, known as the AV node. Ectopic (from the Greek ektopos, meaning \\"out of place\\") refers to the fact that the ventricles are being triggered by tissue that is not the normal pacemaker tissue within the heart. Tachycardia (from the Greek takhys, meaning \\"swift\\", and kardia, meaning heart) means a swift heart rate. By this definition, junctional ectopic tachycardia is an abnormally swift heart rhythm due to cells firing within the heart near the AV node.

Launched on December 1, 2008, it is the first-ever online collaborative orchestra. 2009 The open call for entries was until January 28, 2009. Musicians wishing to audition had to post a video of themselves playing the \\"Internet Symphony No. 1 'Eroica'\\", by Tan Dun, along with a second talent video of themselves playing a preset audition piece to YouTube. Musicians of all cultures were encouraged to audition, as even if a particular instrument was not specifically scored in the original score, a musician was allowed to simply play a part in the same pitch range as their chosen instrument. Judges selected finalists and alternates was from January 29 to February 13, 2009 and the finalists were voted on by the YouTube community from February 14 to February 22, 2009. Winners were announced on March 2, and were invited to travel to New York in April 2009, to participate in the YouTube Symphony Orchestra summit, and play at Carnegie Hall under the direction of Michael Tilson Thomas. As of the concert date, there were 15 million views of the YouTube audition tapes. The concert featured a series of short pieces that had been rehearsed for several days, as well as guest soloists Joshua Roman, Gil Shaham, Measha Brueggergosman, Yuja Wang, and classical / electronica composer Mason Bates. Three children were tutored for the event by pianist Lang Lang and played Rachmaninoff's waltz for piano six hands. The Tan Dun submissions were compiled into a mashup video premiered at Carnegie Hall on April 15, then hosted on the \\"YouTube Symphony Channel\\" as of April 16. 2011 On October 12, 2010, a video posted on the YouTube Symphony channel announced that they would be doing a second symphony, this time performing at the Sydney Opera House on March 20, 2011. Tilson Thomas would again be directing, and had asked Bates to write a piece, entitled Mothership, in which performers would be invited to improvise with the orchestra, both live and via an uplink. A video of the LSO performing Mothership was posted on YouTube on October 11, 2010. The concert also featured a performance of Mozart's \\"Caro bell'idol mio\\" by Renée Fleming and the Sydney Children's Choir. Like the previous year, contestants were required to record themselves performing the piece on their own instruments. However, since the piece features sections of improvisation, players are also invited to send in clips of themselves improvising. Applications closed on November 28, 2010. The performance was broadcast live on Sunday 20th March [of 2011] at 8pm Sydney time, with rebroadcasts being done throughout the day for each time zone. The completed performance was uploaded to YouTube at the end of March 20 and can now be viewed on the symphony channel. It was \\"the most-watched live music concert on the Internet\\", and \\"the most frequently viewed concert in the history of the video-sharing website\\". Reception As of March 20, 2011, the live feed of the concert was the 21st most viewed event in the Musicians Channel on YouTube. The live stream of the Grand Finale concert at the Sydney Opera House was the largest live stream YouTube ever made, connecting 30.7 million streams on computers and a further 2.8 million streams on mobile devices.

The Mexican nobility includes elite indigenous families from the pre-Columbian era; indigenous elites recognized as nobles in the colonial era (1521-1821); and hereditary nobles and economic elites who acquired noble titles in the colonial era; and the First Mexican Empire (1821-23), immediately after independence from Spain, and the Second Mexican Empire (1862-67). While some titles were granted in Mexico itself, other families brought with them their old titles from Europe. The Political Constitution of Mexico has prohibited the state from granting any titles of nobility since 1917. The United Mexican States do not issue or recognize titles of nobility or hereditary prerogatives and honors.  Indigenous nobility  Moctezuma II's royal descendants were granted titles in Mexico and Spain. The Aztecs and other Indigenous peoples in Mexico had a system of hereditary aristocracy in place when the Spanish arrived in Mexico. The Spaniards respected this system and added to it, resulting in many unions between Aztec and Spanish nobility. Descendants of the elites of pre-Columbian Mexico who received these distinctions included the heirs of the Aztec ruler Moctezuma II; That family became known as the Condes de Moctezuma, and later, the Duques of Moctezuma de Tultengo. The holders of the title, who still reside in Spain, became part of the Spanish nobility in 1766 when they received a grandeza. A branch of their family, on the female side, continued to receive an annual payment from the Mexican government in the amount of some 500 gold ducats until 1938, as part of a contract signed in the 16th century granting Mexico City access to water and lumber on family property. Some families of pure Amerindian ancestry, such as the Mixtec Villagómez family, were among the richest landowners in New Spain after the conquest of the Aztec empire. Despite being part of the colonial elite after the conquest, the Villagómez retained their Mixtec identity, speaking the Mixtec language and keeping a collection of Mixtec codices. Numerous other Indigenous elites collaborated with the conquest, earning noble titles and privileges. Most notably, all the Tlaxcallans, who resettled into northern Mexico, became hidalgos. Titles in Viceregal Mexico and the First Mexican Empire Families who received a título de Castilla during the colonial period were the first to be granted European noble titles in New Spain (Mexico). One of the first was the Spanish noble Conquistador Hernán Cortés, who was granted the title of Marqués del Valle de Oaxaca. Cortés's first wife was Doña Catalina Marcaida Jaurez, and the marriage was an important political alliance while he was in Cuba. His second marriage was to a noblewoman. Approximately 130 titles were held by Spaniards born or resident in New Spain. Main centers of population included Mexico City, Puebla, Querétaro, San Miguel de Allende, Guanajuato, Guadalajara, and Morelia (Valladolid). The largest number of noble titles were created in the eighteenth century under the Spanish Bourbon monarchs and the influx of foreign nobles to Mexico. Leading noble families active in 17th, 18th, and 19th century politics, economy, clergy, arts and culture included: :De la LLamosa, Gómez de Cervantes, Romero de Terreros, de la Cámara or Cámara, Rincón-Gallardo, Romay, Riverol, Pérez Gálvez, Rul, Vivanco, La Canal, Cañedo, Fernández de Jáuregui, Obando, Fernández de Córdoba, Gómez de Parada, Lara, Lorenz de Rada, Pérez de Salazar, Ruiz de Velasco, Valdivieso, De Haro y Tamariz, Fagoaga, Echeverz, Dávalos de Bracamonte, Peón, Gutiérrez-Altamirano, Castañiza, Gómez de la Cortina, Urrutia, Velasco, Moncada, Diez de Sollano, de Busto y Moya, Reynoso y Manso de Zúñiga, Capetillo, de la Parra, Villaseñor- Cervantes, Villaseñor-Jasso, López de Zárate, Camino, Caserta, Trebuesto, Ruiz de Esparza, García de Teruel, Espinosa de los Monteros, Vizcarra, Rábago, Sardaneta, Martínez del Río, Ozta, Azcárate y Ledesma, de la Torre Ledesma, Molina Flores, Vera Martinez y Cazarez, Samaniego del Castillo, Lemus, Mier, De la Maza, González de Betolaza, López de Peralta, Padilla, Diez-Gutiérrez, Flores-Alatorre, Cosío, Rivadeneyra, de la Cotera, de la Campa y Cos, Rodríguez Sáenz de Pedroso, Padilla, Rivascacho, Villar-Villamil, Rodríguez Rico, Sánchez de Tagle, Báez de Benavides, Cabrero, Hurtado de Mendoza, López- Portillo, García Pimentel, Meade, Sánchez-Saráchaga, Sainz Trápaga, Villaurrutia, Errazu, Escandón, Heredia de la Pierre, Quintanar, Beovide, Alvarez de Medina, Sánchez de Aldana, Yermo, de Yturbe, de Béistegui, de Rivera, Zubaran-Capmany and Sánchez-Navarro, among others.Doris M. Ladd, The Mexican Nobility at Independence, 1780–1826, Appendix. At independence, a few princely dignities were accorded the Imperial family's relations and three titles of nobility — the latter already under application with the Spanish government — were recognized by the Congress of the First Mexican Empire, such as the Marqués de Samaniego del Castillo. Knighthoods were also created, most notably, of Guadalupe. Throughout the 19th century others received pontifical titles of nobility, and through loopholes in Spanish law, had these titles recognized as títulos de Castilla; these are known as títulos negros and include the titles of the marqués de Barrón, conde de Subervielle, conde del Valle (Fernández del Valle family), duquesa de Mier, and others. Many of these families were part of the hidalgo class. Some families, after Mexican Independence, received títulos de Castilla from the Spanish monarch directly, such as the duque de Regla and the duquesa de Prim, or indirectly, through marriage to individuals holding these titles, such as the duque de Castroterreño or the Escandón family members who subsequently became duques de Montellano, marqueses de Villavieja. Empress Ana María, consort of Agustin I of Mexico, belonged to the House of Tagle of the family of the Marquises of Altamira. After the fall of the First Empire, the imperial family resided in Italy, and later, in the United States. Afterwards, the Second Mexican Empire, under Maximilian I of Mexico of the House of Habsburg, re-established knightly orders. It granted no new titles of nobility.

Prince Agustín de Iturbide y Green, Maximilian's adopted son, who had graduated from Georgetown University, renounced his claim to the throne and title. Iturbide returned to Mexico and served as an officer in the Mexican army. But in 1890, after publishing articles critical of President Porfirio Díaz, he was arrested on charges of sedition and sentenced to fourteen months of imprisonment.\\"Prince Augustin Yturbide: Most of His Life Spent in Washington\\", The New York Times, 4 May 1890 He returned to Georgetown University, as a professor of the Spanish and French languages, and died in 1925. Members of the Rincón Gallardo, Romay-Basail, Fagoaga and Pimentel families (marqués de Guadalupe, señor de Cadro y Monterroso, marqués del Apartado and conde de Heras Soto) were active in Mexico City government, the ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Senate, the armed forces, and the Academia de la Lengua or the Sociedad de Geografía e Historia. Many journeyed and lived abroad, often doing so in Paris, London, and Madrid. Most men studied at British public schools. By marriage into such French families as the Polignacs and de Villeneuves, a number of persons of Mexican descent were noble. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Mexican nobility — both titled and untitled — consisted of approximately 1.5% of Mexico's population, or approximately 200,000 people.Nutini, The Wages of Conquest, 183-189.

Sixty- four Sri Lankan Tamil civilians were killed by soldiers of the Indian Peace Keeping Force. The massacre followed an attack on the soldiers by rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam cadres. The rebel attack had left six Indian soldiers, including an officer, dead, and another 10 injured. Indian authorities claimed that the civilians were caught in crossfire. Journalists such as Rita Sebastian of the Indian Express, David Husego of the Financial Times and local human rights groups such as the University Teachers for Human Rights have reported quoting eyewitness accounts that it was a massacre of civilians. George Fernandes, who later served as defense minister of India (1998–2004), called the massacre India’s My Lai. p.211–212 Background information During the British colonial period, when Sri Lanka was known as Ceylon, most civil service jobs were (roughly 60%) held by minority Sri Lankan Tamils who were approximately 15% of the population. This was due to the availability of western style education provided by American missionaries and others in the Tamil dominant Jaffna Peninsula. The preponderance of Tamils over their natural share of the population was used by populist majority Sinhalese politicians to come to political power by promising to elevate the Sinhalese people. These measures as well as riots and pogroms that targeted the minority Sri Lankan Tamils led to the formation of a number of rebel groups advocating independence for Tamils. Following the 1983 Black July pogrom full scale civil war began between the government and the rebel groups. In 1987 the government of Sri Lanka and India entered into an agreement and invited the Indian Army to be used as peacekeepers. Eventually the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) came into conflict with one of the rebel groups namely the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). During October 1987 the Indian forces trying to wrest control of the Jaffna town stormed the Jaffna hospital resulting in the deaths of a number of staff and patients. By November 1987 the Indian Army was in nominal control of all major towns within the Jaffna Peninsula. But the LTTE after removing most of its fighting cadres south of the peninsula maintained a steady barrage of typical guerilla style attacks throughout 1988 and 1989. This period also saw huge loss of civilian life, claimed rapes and number of instances of mass massacres. p.181 The attack On 2 August 1989, around 11:15 two Indian patrols numbering 30 men approached the Valvettiturai market square on foot when gunfire was heard. This was a crowded market area and was full of people. The ambush by LTTE of the IPKF foot patrol in a crowded market area caught everyone including the civilians by surprise. Six IPKF soldiers were killed and another 10 injured. Following the initial confrontation many troops started moving into town and the LTTE ambush party left the area. A number of people were killed and burnt inside shops. Many people of all ages and both sexes were made to sit in the town square and three rounds were fired into them killing four persons. Many hundreds of civilians took refuge in the spacious houses of one Mr. Subramaniam and Mr. Sivaganesh. Approximately 300 people were in these houses. At 13:30 Indian soldiers entered the house of Mr. Subramaniam and killed him along with eight others in the house. At 16:00 Indian soldiers entered the house of Sivaganesh, took 8 men to a cowshed and shot them but 4 survived. By the end of the day the VVT Citizens’ Committee reported that 52 dead persons had been identified. Another 12 people were reported missing and presumed dead. On 3 August the IPKF imposed a curfew and rounded up large number of young men. About 75 youths were made to roll on the road and were assaulted and 6 killed. Some who did not know about the curfew in nearby villages were also shot and killed. Many of the injured civilians were given first aid by local medical practitioners and were taken to the nearby Oorani government hospital. Some injured had walked to Point Pedro hospital, 5 miles away by late evening on 2 August. The arrival of injured civilians at the Point Pedro hospital prompted Mme. Jacqueline, the nursing sister from the Médecins Sans Frontières, to attempt to send an ambulance to the scene of the mass killings. She was refused permission to reach the scene of the killings. It was reported that no attempt was made to help the injured by the Indian military officials. After the relaxing of the curfew on 4 August, those who survived the massacre reached the major hospitals for treatment. Reactions According to the Financial Times report, the Indians believe that the incident resulted from a deliberate provocation by the LTTE intended to trigger an overwhelming Indian response; thus tarnishing the IPKF’s image, during sensitive negotiations to leave the island nation. The Indian embassy claimed that 24 civilians were killed in crossfire. A later report on All India Radio claimed that 18 LTTE personnel and 12 civilians were killed. The statement by the Chief Minister of the North East Mr. Varadarajaperumal dismissed the local media reports as exaggerations. According to an affidavit by an eyewitness, very next day, the Commanding Officer of Vadamaradchi (region), Brigadier Shankar Prasad, the Deputy Commander, Col Aujla, and the Udupiddy Commanding Officer, Colonel Sharma met some of the survivors and apologized. George Fernandes who served as India's defence minister from 1998 to 2004 termed the massacres as India’s My Lai.

Newcombe is the Laura H. Carnell Professor of Psychology and the James H. Glackin Distinguished Faculty Fellow at Temple University. She is a Canadian-American researcher in cognitive development, cognitive psychology and cognitive science, working on the development of spatial thinking and reasoning and on the development of episodic memory. She was the principal investigator of the Spatial Intelligence and Learning Center, one of six NSF- funded Science of Learning Centers. Background Newcombe received her Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1976. She has served as the Chair of the Cognitive Science Society Board, President of the Cognitive Development Society, Division 7 (Developmental) of the American Psychological Association, the Eastern Psychological Association and as Chair of the Board of Scientific Affairs of the American Psychological Association. She has been elected as a Fellow in various societies including the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Society of Experimental Psychologists, the Association for Psychological Science, four divisions of the American Psychological Association, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Newcombe's contributions to spatial cognition and its development are extensive. Her book with Janellen Huttenlocher in 2003, Making Space, synthesized decades of research and provided a new direction for the field, and provides a new conceptualization of cognitive development different from either traditional nativist or from traditional empiricist approaches. In addition, she has worked on sex differences in cognition, beginning in the late 1970s with a critical look at a then-popular explanation of sex differences in spatial functioning in terms the onset of puberty. Since then, she has recognized the evolutionary and neural factors involved in sex differences while also emphasizing the malleability of cognitive ability as noted in the literature. (recently reprinted in a special issue celebrating 25 years of Applied Cognitive Psychology). Newcombe has been the keynote speaker discussing relevant developments in spatial cognition at several meetings such as the Psychonomic Society, the American Psychological Society, the International Mind Brain Education Society and the German Psychological Society. Spatial Intelligence and Learning Center Newcombe led the Spatial Intelligence and Learning Center (SILC), one of 6 NSF-funded Science of Learning Centers that explore learning in an interdisciplinary framework, during its grant period from 2006-2018. She has thus brought spatial cognition to the forefront of our conceptualization of the human intellect and its potential for learning. In her work on memory and memory development, Newcombe has integrated research from adult cognitive psychology and neuroscience to the study of development, both in terms of distinctions between implicit and explicit memory and distinctions between semantic and episodic memory. Awards and fellowships Newcombe has received the 2014 APA William James Fellow Award recognizing her achievement in advancing the field of cognitive science, G. Stanley Hall Award, the George A. Miller Award, an Award for Distinguished Service to Psychological Science, and the Women in Cognitive Science Mentorship Award. She was a James McKeen Cattell Fellow for a sabbatical year at Princeton in 1999-2000. She is a Fellow of the Cognitive Science Society. Selected works Theory Newcombe, N. S. (2011).
