During performances, he plays old Silvertone archtop guitars, wears a full body human cannonball suit, and a helmet wired to a telephone receiver, which allows him to devote his hands and feet to guitar and drums. His show has been described as a blues punk guitar dance party. Log tours internationally, performing about 150 shows each year; he has made tours of North America, Europe, Japan and Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Taiwan, and Iceland. Early life Bob Log III was born in Chicago, Illinois and raised in Tucson, Arizona. Growing up, Log listened to musical artists such as AC/DC, Screaming Jay Hawkins, Bo Diddley, Hasil Adkins and Chuck Berry.Kansas City Star Interview from Bob Log III: Official Website Log got his first guitar at the age of 11, and by the age of 16 he had moved to slide guitar, playing Delta blues, modeling his slide guitar style on that of Mississippi Fred McDowell. Career Bob Log III playing at the 100 Club in London, England, 2008 Log began his music career recording and touring with Mondo Guano, a four-piece slide guitar, blues, home-made percussion band based in Tucson, Arizona. Upon leaving Mondo Guano, Log went on to perform as one half of the Delta blues rock duo, Doo Rag, with bandmate Thermos Malling. After six years of making music with Doo Rag, Bob began a solo career, warming up audiences bands, including R. L. Burnside, Blues Explosion, Ween, Franz Ferdinand, and Ani Difranco. Over time, Log acquired a kick-drum and a homemade foot cymbal which he custom-outfitted with a kick pedal of its own. These instruments, combined with his slide guitar work, telephone microphone vocals, and drum machine accompaniment, form the framework on which Bob Log constructs his songs. His version of quick Delta blues is based on the sound that he and Thermos developed in the duo Doo Rag, with greater emphasis on guitar showmanship, fingerpicking, and one-man-band-style drumming with his feet. He began touring in North America, including performances in Toronto in 1999 and 2000.\\"Live Review: 20 Miles & Bob Log III January 24, 2000 The Horseshoe – Toronto, ON\\". Chart Attack, Review by Keith Carman =Stage Persona= Log describes his on-stage setup in the song \\"One Man Band Boom\\", introducing himself to the audience as, \\"Bob Log the third, one-man band, Tucson, Arizona. Heyeeeh! Lemme introduce the band to ya. On cymbals, left foot. Over here on the bass drum we got right foot. Shut up! This is my left hand that does all the slide work, right hand does the pickin'. My mouth hole does most of the talkin'. And you're looking at my finger. My finger is an asshole.\\"Pixel Surgeon Interview =The monkey paw= An early press release from record label Fat Possum claimed Log had a monkey paw grafted on to his wrist after a boating accident as a child. When asked to explain Fat Possum's insistence that his right hand is a monkey's paw, Log replied to an interviewer that, \\"My hand is just hairy. Very, very hairy. It is NOT a paw. Fat Possum was drunk.\\"Pixel Surgeon Interview =Audience participation= During performances Bob Log will often call audience members (both male and female) on stage to sit on his knee while he plays. Log credits years of drumming with his feet for his ability to simultaneously drum and support the weight of multiple people: \\"My legs are huge now. Sometimes I can get a girl on each knee and bounce 'em along.\\"Bizarre Interview from Bob Log III: Official Website Log has distinctively used breasts as a theme in his performance and hired two \\"professional women\\" to use their breasts as percussion instruments on his song \\"Clap Your Tits\\". Log is quick to point out that all of these acts are carried out between consenting adults and individuals familiar with his brand of humor, stating, \\"First of all, if you come to my show knowing I've got a song called \\"Boob Scotch\\" and you get offended, I'm sorry but I've got to say just get out.\\"Kansas City Star Interview from Bob Log III: Official Website Eventually, Bob Log added a wireless set-up to his guitar in order to allow him to take part in more active antics about the venues in which he is playing. On a number of occasions, Bob has set sail atop his audience in an inflatable dingy or played portions of his set from the women's washroom. During various shows on his September 2009 UK tour Bob Log would enter/exit the stage whilst playing guitar sitting on top of the shoulders of Russell Gray, lead singer of Russell and The Wolves. =Boob Scotch= One of Bob Log III's more controversial antics is 'Boob Scotch', that is, scotch which has been stirred by a female (or male) breast.Kansas City Star Interview from Bob Log III: Official Website This practice was integrated into the song \\"Boob Scotch\\" from the album Log Bomb, in which Bob Log sings \\"I think we need to sit down and talk, put your boob in my scotch. Come on dip your tit in my drink, stir my scotch with something that's pink.\\"Lyrics to Boob Scotch from the Warehouse Bob Log III often invites audience members to 'make' a Boob Scotch, asking them onstage to dip their breast in his scotch (usually ordered for him by a fan) after which he lifts his helmet slightly and downs the drink. Log has also been known to dip his own breast in his scotch.  Lyrical quotes  Bob Log III, 2018 * \\"I'm a professional, God damn it. I live in a car.\\" * \\"Ladies and gentlemen's ...

It runs between the Adelaide city centre and the southern suburbs of Adelaide - Pasadena and Panorama, and has a speed limit of . Concourse Starting at the intersection of Anzac Highway, West Terrace and South Terrace in the south-western corner of the Adelaide city centre, the road continues south, through the southern Adelaide Parklands. Goodwood Road continues south through the suburb of Wayville, passing the Royal Adelaide Showgrounds. The traffic lights at Leader Street mark the boundary with the suburb of Goodwood, and the location of the Goodwood Park Hotel. The road then crosses the Glenelg tramline and, although it retains 4 lanes, the speed limit is reduced to 50 km/h, and the road narrows as it passes the Goodwood library, civic centre and shopping precinct which also contains a theatre, the Capri cinema, numerous restaurants, and the Goodwood Primary school. Victoria Street marks the boundary with the suburb of Millswood. The road continues past the former Goodwood Orphanage through the so-called \\"Goodwood Subway\\", (adjacent to Millswood railway station). This is a deep road underpass which has double- lane traffic in both directions, and an elevated pedestrian walkway along the western wall. It was originally built for the Goodwood Road tram traffic to pass safely under the Belair railway line and the main Adelaide-Melbourne Railway Line. Although the trams stopped travelling along Goodwood Road, and the tracks were removed, many decades ago, the subway continues to provide grade-separation between a very busy arterial road and a railway line with long, slow freight trains. Past the subway, the road widens and the speed limit returns to 60 km/h again, and continues south through the suburbs of Kings Park, ( east side - possibly Adelaide's smallest suburb), and Clarence Park (west side) to the intersection with Cross Road and the A3, a busy intersection now monitored by speed and red light cameras. Passing through the suburbs of Cumberland Park (west side) and Westbourne Park (east side), the next major intersection is where Edward Street and Grange Road meet, and marks the start of Colonel Light Gardens (east side) and Daw Park (west side). Here the road widens considerably to 6 lanes and dual carriageway separated by a wide central grassed nature strip containing many trees. At the rather disjointed intersection of Springbank and Daws roads, although it retains 6 lanes and dual carriageway, the road narrows and its wide central nature strip is replaced by a narrow concrete curb. Also located at this intersection are the Repatriation General Hospital, Daw Park, the Pasadena High School, the Douglas Mawson Institute of TAFE and Bedford Industries. Goodwood Road continues south through Pasadena (west side) and Panorama (east side) for almost another kilometre, passing Centennial Park Cemetery on the west side before bending in a south-westerly direction. It is at this point that the name \\"Goodwood Road\\" ends, and is replaced by Fiveash Drive, although there is no change in the structure of the thoroughfare itself.

Often associated with Yorkshire, particularly the Leeds area, it is very widespread and popular elsewhere, notably in Lancashire. Parkin is baked to a hard cake but with resting becomes moist and even sometimes sticky. In Hull and East Yorkshire, it has a drier, more biscuit-like texture than in other areas. Parkin is traditionally eaten on Guy Fawkes Night, 5 November, but is also enjoyed throughout the winter months. It is baked commercially throughout Yorkshire, but is mainly a domestic product in other areas. Etymology The origin of the word parkin is unknown. The first published dated reference to parkin was collected from 1728 from the West Yorkshire Quarter Sessions when Anne Whittaker was accused of stealing oatmeal to make parkin. The Lancashire weaver Tim Bobbin describes tharf cake in 1740, and this is recognisable as a parkin. A possible older use of parkin is in the seventeenth century ballad 'The song of Arthur O'Bradley' that purports to describe a merry wedding from the time of Robin Hood (fourteenth century) The tharf cake is of ancient Teutonic origin, as tharf or theorf meant unleavened, un-fermented, solid tough or sodden in Old English. John Wycliffe in his translation of the Bible in 1389 (Mark Ch.14.v. 1) calls unleavened bread a \\"tharf loove\\" History Parkin is virtually unknown south of the Humber. It is eaten in an area where oats were the staple grain for the poor, rather than wheat. It is closely related to tharf cake – an unsweetened cake cooked on a griddle rather than baked. The traditional time of the year for tharf cakes to be made was directly after the oat harvest in the first week in November. For festive occasions, the cake would be sweetened with honey. In the seventeenth century (about 1650) sugar started to be imported from Barbados, and molasses was a by-product of the refining process. Molasses was first used by apothecaries; to make a medicine theriaca, from which name the word treacle is derived. As molasses became plentiful, or treacle as it became called at that time, it was substituted for honey in the preparation of tharf cakes. In Northern Europe honey was used as a medicine, for festive cakes and making mead; before 1750 sweetness was not a characteristic of everyday food. Honey cakes had a special festive significance. They were baked to be hard, but after storage for a couple of weeks they regained their moisture becoming soft and even sticky. Molasses has hygroscopic properties. German Lebkuchen and Pfefferkuchen were other examples of hygroscopic holiday ginger-breads. They too were baked hard in summer and allowed to moisten for consumption at Christmas. Though parkin and tharf cake appear to be synonymous, all parkins generally were sweet tharf cakes. =Tharf cake= Parkin and tharf cake were used interchangeably in Lancashire and South Yorkshire until 1900. Over the 500 years the recipe and taste of these cakes have changed considerably. It was the food of the poor. Ovens were rare in the houses of the poor, and they generally had no access to public bakers before the 1820s, so the cakes were cooked on griddles or bakestones on an open fire. The best parkin was made with fresh oatmeal, which fixes the date around the first week in November. =Festivities= In southern Lancashire and West Yorkshire, parkin is inextricably linked to the Guy Fawkes Night celebration. Jennifer Stead, in her study Prodigal Frugality, identifies the link between Guy Fawkes and parkin as the bonfire. The first two weeks in November had many Christian festivals, and like Celtic festivals that preceded them they were celebrated with a fire and ritual cakes. November starts with All Hallows Eve, that runs into All Saints Day (1 November), which is followed by All Souls Day (2 November). Little Lent and the forty-day fast until Christmas, started at Martinmas. (11 November). On All Souls Day soul cakes were baked. The Martinmas fair was important being the traditional day when cattle were bought and sold, and servants were hired for the following year. It was also the date that cattle were slaughtered and salted to preserve them for the winter and for general feasting and dancing. The Celtic festival of Samain, the festival of the dead on 1 November was celebrated with special cakes and bonfires. It was Christianised into All Hallows by the church in 837 A.D., and the culinary tradition continued. When Guy Fawkes in 1605 gave the English church a reason to celebrate with a bonfire, the tradition was adopted under the new name, just four days later on 5 November. During the period of industrialisation many traditional holidays were discontinued but Guy Fawkes Night continued to be celebrated. In the nineteenth century (1862), parkin and treacle toffee with potatoes baked in the fire had become the traditional foods of Guy Fawkes Night, and in Leeds, November 5 became known as Parkin Night. Ingredients The principal ingredients of a Yorkshire parkin are oatmeal, flour, black treacle (similar to molasses), fat (traditionally lard, but modern recipes use butter, margarine or rapeseed oil), and ginger. Oatmeal and treacle are generally considered distinctive features of Yorkshire parkin, whilst Lancashire Parkin is baked using golden syrup, treacle and soft brown sugar. The flour used in parkin in England is self-raising, containing a small amount of chemical leavening agent. If this is not available, or if the proportion of oatmeal is high, it is essential to add a leavening agent, e.g. baking powder or a mixture of sodium bicarbonate and cream of tartar. One of the key features of parkin is that it retains its texture well. It is baked to be hard, but after storing in a sealed tin or box for several days, it becomes soft again, the texture that is intended.

Since its founding in the early twentieth century, Phi Kappa has chartered nearly fifty chapters across the Deep South, from Georgia to Texas, Arkansas to Florida. No chapters of the fraternity have ever been chartered outside of the old Confederacy, making Phi Kappa the oldest and largest exclusively Southern Greek-letter social fraternity. The fraternity's colors are Purple and White. The fraternity flower is the camellia and the fraternity jewel is the amethyst. The badge of the fraternity is a gold rhombus (diamond) with blue enamel. Engraved upon the badge in gold are a Greek lamp at the apex, crossed scimitars in the middle and, at the bottom, the Greek letters ΦΚ. The crossed scimitars are a well-known symbol of the fraternity. The foundational principles of the fraternity are Brotherhood, Faith in God, Scholarship, and Community Service. Famous alumni of Phi Kappa include astronaut Fred Haise, Jr. (T), who served as the Lunar Module Pilot on the Apollo 13 mission, John Alexander (ΔΧ), a leading tenor at the Metropolitan Opera for over four decades, Gilbert Carmichael (ΔΧ), former Federal Railroad Administrator and current Senior Chairman of the Intermodal Transportation Institute at University of Denver, Dr. Jerome V. Reel, Jr. (ΑΩ) who currently serves as Senior Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Studies at Clemson University and U.S. Congressman Steven Palazzo (ΘΓ), current Representative for Mississippi's 4th Congressional District. Two governors of Mississippi (Thomas L. Bailey, who served from 1943–46 and Fielding L. Wright, who served from 1946–52) served as adult sponsors (i.e. \\"chapter fathers\\") of local Phi Kappa chapters. As a high school student at the Lamar School in Meridian, Mississippi, actress Sela Ward was an honoree (or \\"little sister\\") for the Delta Chi chapter of Phi Kappa. History Phi Kappa's founding is shrouded in mystery. Though tradition records a founding date of February 3, 1900 for the fraternity, if this is accurate, Phi Kappa must have remained strictly subrosa at the institution of its birth, the Southern University Preparatory School in Greensboro, Alabama, for at least fifteen years. No names or other information are known about this supposed turn-of-the-century founding, a fact which may well be due to the secretive nature of the Alpha Chapter. On the other hand, some fraternity historians have surmised that the date may have been arbitrarily chosen by the fraternity at a later date and that the true foundation of Phi Kappa is tied to the young man that has been honored from at least the 1920s, as her \\"founder.\\" That young man's name was Jacob Broughton Nelson. While it is known that he was connected to the fraternity's first known expansion in 1919, Nelson may actually be rightly honored with the title \\"founder\\" for from all recorded memories, nothing was known of Phi Kappa before Nelson emerged into history as its first \\"Grand Master\\" in the spring of 1919. It is doubtful that the truth about the founding of Phi Kappa will ever be known with certainty because death has silenced the earliest witnesses to the Order's genesis. But whether the fraternity was founded by unknown persons in 1900 or was actually begun in 1919 by Nelson himself, it was under the leadership and initiative of Jacob Broughton Nelson that the fraternity began earnest expansion, enabling thousands of young men throughout the South to experience the benefits of membership in Phi Kappa. Phi Kappa Badge \\"Broughton\\" Nelson (as he was known to friends and family members), the man Phi Kappas called founder, was a tragic and mysterious figure who appeared suddenly, rising like a blazing star in Phi Kappa's early years and then, just as suddenly, vanished into mystery and fraternity lore. The known facts regarding Broughton Nelson are few but they paint a fascinating picture of a young man accustomed to hardship. Nelson was born on July 31, 1898 in Brundidge, Alabama. Unknown circumstances in Broughton's infancy caused him to be adopted by his birth mother's half-sister and her husband. He was raised by his aunt and uncle, Laura Locke and Rev. Jacob Boone Nelson respectively. Rev. Jacob Boone Nelson was a circuit minister for the Methodist Episcopal Church, South in southern Alabama. In 1915, Broughton enrolled as a student at Southern University (Southern), a Methodist institution in Greensboro, Alabama. From all accounts, Broughton was a likable and popular fellow at Southern. The death of Broughton's uncle and adoptive father, Jacob Boone Nelson, in 1916 most likely cut short Broughton's tenure at Southern. He moved back home to live with his adoptive (and now widowed) mother in Troy, Alabama. In the summer of 1917, Broughton's friend and roommate from Southern, Jack Oscar Hain, visited him in Troy and found that Broughton had established a second chapter of Phi Kappa—Upsilon (Υ)--in that town. The Upsilon chapter was very popular in Troy. It had its own chapter room above Lorch's Jewelry store on the Troy town square and competed for members with the Jaguar Club, another social club in town. That summer, during his visit, Hain was initiated into the Upsilon chapter of Phi Kappa. The following fall, Hain enrolled in the Gulf Coast Military Academy (GCMA) in Gulfport, Mississippi. Also attending GCMA in the fall of 1917 were three other members of Troy's Upsilon Chapter: Clarence Heath Cowart, William F. Palmer and F. Joseph Hendley. Though invited to join other fraternities already on campus, the four, in loyalty to their fraternity, decided to form their own chapter of Phi Kappa at GCMA. With Broughton Nelson's assistance, the chapter was chartered as Mu Theta (ΜΘ), two letters which would come to symbolize for the fraternity utmost dedication to Phi Kappa and her ideals. Around the same time, a fourth chapter—Gamma Beta (ΓΒ)--was chartered at the newly created Emory University Academy in Oxford, Georgia. During this earliest period of expansion, there was a trend to name the chapters outside of Phi Kappa's home state of Alabama with a Greek letter corresponding to the new chapter's state. So, while the first two chapters (both founded inside Alabama) retained single-letter chapter names (Alpha at Southern and Upsilon at Troy), Phi Kappa's third chapter chose the name Mu Theta (Mu standing for Mississippi) while the fourth chapter bore the name Gamma Beta, with Gamma standing for Georgia. This early pattern of chapter designation was soon abandoned. Only twenty years after her birth, Phi Kappa lost the young man who had led her out of obscurity, into two neighboring states and, in so doing, who set the stage for unprecedented growth of Phi Kappa's ideals across the South. Around 1921, Broughton Nelson left his family and friends in Troy and never returned. Neither family nor friends ever saw Broughton again. The circumstances surrounding Broughton Nelson's disappearance in 1921 are as mysterious as those surrounding the birth of the fraternity which honors him as founder. It seems as though Nelson left Troy sometime after 1920 for he appears in the 1920 federal census as a resident of Troy. At that point, facts end and speculation begins. It has been reported that Brougton died as a victim of tuberculosis in Colorado but this claim has not been verified. It was also reported that he simply moved to Texas around 1920. But the fact is that no one has come across any records of Jacob Broughton Nelson after 1920. Regardless of whether he died or disappeared, no one in Troy or in any Phi Kappa chapter, friend or family, ever saw or heard from Broughton Nelson again after 1920. His sudden and unexplained absence brought a hard blow to the Phi Kappa he knew so well. Troy's Upsilon chapter disintegrated after Broughton's disappearance. The Alpha chapter had been forced to fold in 1918 when the Southern University Preparatory School was closed. Emory University Academy's Gamma Beta chapter, though reportedly a strong link in Phi Kappa's chain, was geographically isolated and finally succumbed to the pressure of an anti-fraternity administration in 1924. If it were not for Mu Theta's strength during this time in the fraternity's history, Phi Kappa probably would not have survived. While the other chapters were dying or being forced to die, Mu Theta was building and growing and was willing and able to take the leadership position in the Fraternity and at Gulf Coast Military Academy. As the members of Mu Theta fanned out across the South each summer break, many returned to their hometowns and founded Phi Kappa chapters. Through these actions, Mu Theta earned the moniker within Phi Kappa of \\"Mother Mu Theta,\\" because it was from this one chapter that all subsequent chapters of Phi Kappa were born. When Phi Kappa's coat-of-arms was adopted, it incorporated the Greek letters Mu Theta in one quadrant of the shield to recognize the important role in the fraternity's survival played by the chapter at Gulf Coast Military Academy. In a far-reaching effort to protect Phi Kappa from growing anti-fraternity sentiment, the fraternity was incorporated in the state of Delaware in 1943 under the guidance of alumnus Guy D. Campbell (Δ), a former Exalted Grand Master (national president) who would later earn national recognition for his contributions to the field of medical research. It is likely that the fraternity was incorporated as \\"Phi Kappa National Fraternity\\" instead of simply as \\"Phi Kappa Fraternity\\" because in 1943 there was already a well-established and well-known college fraternity called Phi Kappa. The identifying term \\"national\\" was most likely added in Phi Kappa's incorporation application to distinguish the secondary fraternity from the college fraternity to which she was linked in name only.

Even without official recognition by local school officials (and, in many instances, in the face of blatant anti-fraternity policies), many local chapters demonstrated uncommon resilience and longevity in some Southern communities, with membership in Phi Kappa becoming a proud family tradition for high school students in many cities across the Deep South. Much like a college fraternity, prospective members of Phi Kappa are chosen by the active membership of the local chapter and are extended a bid to pledge the fraternity. The pledging period usually lasts around one academic semester. During this period, pledges learn about the fraternity and become better acquainted with the active members. The importance of academics is stressed and pledges are expected to maintain a certain level of academic achievement during the pledge period. Hazing (physical, psychological or otherwise) of pledges is strictly forbidden by the fraternity. After completion of the pledge period, the new members are initiated into the fraternity and, at that point, become full and equal members of Phi Kappa. Local chapters are run by officers elected from the chapter's high school-aged membership. The officers include a Grand Master (president), Worthy Master (vice president), Scribe (secretary), Treasurer, Pledge Master (pledge trainer) and a Sergeant-at-Arms who keeps order at meetings. Other officers may be elected and/or appointed as needed. Weekly chapter meetings are usually rotated between the homes of members, though some chapters maintain a permanent meeting space. Regular and punctual attendance at chapter meetings (much like their college fraternity counterparts) is considered mandatory. The Phi Kappa members plan and coordinate their own activities with community service projects and social activities making up a large part of the typical chapter calendar. Each chapter has at least one adult sponsor (usually known as the \\"chapter parent\\" with most chapters having a \\"chapter mom\\" and a \\"chapter dad\\") and each elects at least one female honoree (or \\"little sister\\") from each grade at a local high school. One senior honoree is chosen as the chapter \\"Sweetheart.\\" Little Sisters the Sweetheart attend the weekly chapter meetings and help the chapter to plan and execute social and charitable functions but they are not initiated into the fraternity. National organization Phi Kappa is led, on the national level, by alumni members who make up a governing body known as the Executive Council (EC). Some of the Executive Council officers are elected by delegates of the fraternity who attend Phi Kappa's annual national Convention. Other positions on the EC are appointed by the elected EC members. Besides the yearly national convention, the fraternity also hosts another annual, national gathering called Conclave. Grand Masters' Retreat (begun in 1960) is held annually to sharpen leadership skills and social ties between the officers of the various chapters. Founder's Day (begun in 1980 and held on or near Jacob Brougton Nelson's birthday of July 31) is recognized locally each year by the chapters, as is Community Service Project Day where all of the fraternity's chapters work in conjunction to assist a worthy cause. National publications include The Scimitar (a national yearbook), The Herald (the national newsletter), and The Key (which publishes necessary secret information for the fraternity, as needed). The pledge manual is called The Nelson Dream. Although Phi Kappa had chartered nearly fifty chapters and had initiated more than 10,000 young men throughout the years, only ten of these chapters survived into the third millennium. Unfortunately, many of these chapters were severely weakened by a few high profile, yet isolated, instances of carelessness and ungentlemanlike conduct at national events. By 2005, the fraternity shrunk to encompass only a handful of chapters in a few southern Mississippi cities. The fraternity's oldest chapter, Lambda (Λ), was chartered in Mobile, Alabama in 1923. In 2007, a concerted effort at re-organizing and expanding the national fraternity was begun. The Alpha Omega (ΑΩ) chapter in New Orleans was re-chartered with four young men leading the chapter. Although best efforts were put forth by the chapter to colonize, due to public disinterest the chapter failed to gain any new members before the chapter was forced to disband in 2009. The devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was concentrated on the Mississippi Gulf Coast (where all but one of the remaining Phi Kappa chapters were located). The unprecedented circumstances brought about by this storm ravaged lives and destroyed infrastructure and communication along the Gulf Coast. In the aftermath of the storm, many schools were forced to close temporarily and many students evacuated the area, disrupting the lives of nearly all Coast residents. Phi Kappa was not immune to the hurricane's lasting effects these circumstances contributed to a severe weakening of the fraternity. The disaster forced the remaining coastal chapters of the fraternity into long periods of inactivity from which it has been difficult to recover. Sadly, many national records, archives and irreplaceable historical memorabilia of the fraternity were lost in the storm's ravages. The buildings of the former Gulf Coast Military Academy in Gulfport, Mississippi were also heavily damaged - likely beyond repair.

It takes place after the Trojan War, but before the Greeks have departed Troy (roughly the same time as The Trojan Women, another play by Euripides). The central figure is Hecuba, wife of King Priam, formerly Queen of the now-fallen city. It depicts Hecuba's grief over the death of her daughter Polyxena, and the revenge she takes for the murder of her youngest son Polydorus. Plot In the play's opening, the ghost of Polydorus tells how when the war threatened Troy, he was sent to King Polymestor of Thrace for safekeeping, with gifts of gold and jewelry. But when Troy lost the war, Polymestor treacherously murdered Polydorus, and seized the treasure. Polydorus has foreknowledge of many of the play's events and haunted his mother's dreams the night before. The events take place on the coast of Thrace, as the Greek navy returns home from Troy. The Trojan queen Hecuba, now enslaved by the Greeks, mourns her great losses and worries about the portents of her nightmare. The Chorus of young slave women enters, bearing fateful news. One of Hecuba's last remaining daughters, Polyxena, is to be killed on the tomb of Achilles as a blood sacrifice to his honor (reflecting the sacrifice of Iphigenia at the start of the war). Greek commander Odysseus enters, to escort Polyxena to an altar where Neoptolemus will shed her blood. Odysseus ignores Hecuba's impassioned pleas to spare Polyxena, and Polyxena herself says she would rather die than live as a slave. In the first Choral interlude, the Chorus lament their own doomed fate, cursing the sea breeze that will carry them on ships to the foreign lands where they will live in slavery. The Greek messenger Talthybius arrives, tells a stirring account of Polyxena's strikingly heroic death, and delivers a message from Agamemnon, chief of the Greek army, to bury Polyxena. Hecuba sends a slave girl to fetch water from the sea to bathe her daughter's corpse. After a second Choral interlude, the body of Polydorus is brought on stage, having washed up on shore. Upon recognizing her son whom she thought safe, Hecuba reaches new heights of despair. Hecuba rages inconsolably against the brutality of such an action, and resolves to take revenge. Agamemnon enters, and Hecuba, tentatively at first and then boldly requests that Agamemnon help her avenge her son's murder. Hecuba's daughter Cassandra is a concubine of Agamemnon so the two have some relationship to protect and Agamemnon listens. Agamemnon reluctantly agrees, as the Greeks await a favorable wind to sail home. The Greek army considers Polymestor an ally and Agamemnon does not wish to be observed helping Hecuba against him. Polymestor arrives with his sons. He inquires about Hecuba's welfare, with a pretense of friendliness. Hecuba reciprocates, concealing her knowledge of the murder of Polydorus. Hecuba tells Polymestor she knows where the remaining treasures of Troy are hidden, and offers to tell him the secrets, to be passed on to Polydorus. Polymestor listens intently. Hecuba convinces him and his sons to enter an offstage tent where she claims to have more personal treasures. Enlisting help from other slaves, Hecuba kills Polymestor's sons and stabs Polymestor's eyes. He re-enters blinded and savage, hunting as if a beast for the women who ruined him. Agamemnon re-enters angry with the uproar and witnesses Hecuba's revenge. Polymestor argues that Hecuba's revenge was a vile act, whereas his murder of Polydorus was intended to preserve the Greek victory and dispatch a young Trojan, a potential enemy of the Greeks. The arguments take the form of a trial, and Hecuba delivers a rebuttal exposing Polymestor's speech as sophistry. Agamemnon decides justice has been served by Hecuba's revenge. Polymestor, again in a rage, foretells the deaths of Hecuba by drowning and Agamemnon by his wife Clytemnestra, who also kills Cassandra. Soon after, the wind finally rises again, the Greeks will sail, and the Chorus goes to an unknown, dark fate. The plot falls into two clearly distinguished parts: the Greeks' sacrifice of Hecuba's daughter, Polyxena, to the shade of Achilles, and the vengeance of Hecuba on Polymestor, the Thracian king.

He was the uncle of composer and music theorist Anton Reicha. Josef Reicha was born in Chudenice. In 1761 he moved to Prague, where he was taught cello by Franz Joseph Werner. In 1771 Reicha became first cellist in the Kapelle of Prince (Fürst) Kraft Ernst von Oettingen- Wallerstein. Together with the famous violinist Anton Janitsch, who also played in the Kapelle, Reicha toured several European cities during the late 1770s and visited Leopold Mozart in Salzburg in 1778.Československý hudební slovník II., p. 416 In his letters to Wolfgang Amadeus, Leopold praised Reicha's cello playing and compared the style of one of his cello concerts to those by Wolfgang Amadeus. Reicha adopted his nephew Anton in 1780 (Josef married in 1779, but the marriage produced no children) and subsequently taught him the violin and the piano. In 1785 Josef was made director of the orchestra in Bonn by Maximilian Francis of Austria, Elector of Cologne; the whole family moved to Bonn. Anton became a member of the Hofkapelle through his uncle. Other members included the young Beethoven, who played the viola and the organ, and Nikolaus Simrock, founder of the Simrock music publishing firm, who played the horn in the orchestra. Simrock would later publish Josef's works. In 1789 Josef became music director of the new theater, Bonner Nationaltheater. Unfortunately, his musical career was cut short in 1791, when he contracted gout. He died four years later in Bonn.  Style  Reicha wrote music for orchestra and chamber ensembles of different kinds. His works include symphonies, various concertos including eleven for cello, twelve partitas for wind instruments and miscellaneous other works. Most of Reicha's compositions were completed in Wallerstein, before his Bonn years. His writing for strings and cello particularly is markedly virtuosic, reflecting his own skill. Music scholar Ludwig Schiedermair in 'Der junge Beethoven' (Leipzig, 1925) gave specific examples taken from Reicha's partitas and symphonies and has proven that these works influenced Beethoven. Other important admirers of Reicha included Leopold Mozart and Michael Haydn.  Notes   References  * Claus Reinländer. \\"Reicha, Josef\\", Grove Music Online, ed. L.

It is a costumbrist novel representative of the Spanish romantic movement. It may be considered a precursor of the criollist novels of the 1920s and 1930s in Latin America. Despite being Isaacs' only novel, María is considered one of the most important works of 19th-century Spanish American literature. Alfonso M. Escudero characterized it as the greatest Spanish- language romantic novel.Alfonso M. Escudero, Costumbrismo Il. Literatura Hispanoamericana , Ediciones Rialp S.A. Gran Enciclopedia Rialp, 1991. Accessed online 2010-01-21. The romantic style of the novel has been compared to the one of Chateaubriand's Atala. Notable are the description of the landscape and the artistic style of the prose. The novel has several autobiographical elements, such as both main characters being natives of Valle del Cauca, or Efraín's departure to Bogotá to pursue his studies. It has been claimed that Maria herself is based, at least in part, upon a cousin of the author. The hacienda \\"El Paraíso\\", owned by Isaacs' family, also figures as an important location throughout the novel; it is currently preserved as a museum. The story narrates the idyllic and tragic love between María and her cousin Efraín, both natives of Valle del Cauca. In the middle of a romantic and bucolic landscape, the young characters fall in love with each other but circumstances prevent the full realization of their love. The first hurdle is Efraín's departure for six years to Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, in order to pursue his high school education. After Efraín returns to Valle del Cauca the couple is able to live together, albeit for only three months, before he is forced to travel to London in order to study medicine. Two years later Efraín returns to Colombia to find that María has died of illness. Heart- broken, Efraín decides to leave Cauca definitely, this time without a fixed destination.

He served as a Vice President of Basketball Operations with the Minnesota Timberwolves of the NBA, and also as general manager of the Toronto Raptors from 2004 to 2006.  Education  Babcock was born in Phoenix, Arizona in 1953.https://www.stalberttoday.ca/national-sports/former-raptors- gm-rob-babcock-dies-had-been-battling-pancreatic-cancer-1457675 He earned his master's degree in secondary education and psychology from Arizona State University in 1977. He received an undergraduate degree in 1974 from Grand Canyon University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in education and social studies. He then taught briefly at Paradise Valley High School in Phoenix, where he also coached the freshman basketball team.  Career  Babcock was head coach at Phoenix College, where his teams advanced to the ACCAC playoffs twice and were the regional runners-up in 1986. He has \\"23 years of NBA management experience\\".http://www.nba.com/timberwolves/wolves/basketball_operations.html In 2011, the Bleacher Report named Rob Babcock as one of the \\"10 Worst NBA GMs in League history\\".http://bleacherreport.com/articles/777078-nba-power- rankings-isiah-thomas-and-the-10-worst-gms-in-league-history/page/3 = NBA scout = He joined the NBA in 1987 as the director of scouting for the Denver Nuggets. He also held part-time scouting positions with the Detroit Pistons, Cleveland Cavaliers, San Diego Clippers and Indiana Pacers before joining the Nuggets staff. = Minnesota Timberwolves = Babcock then worked with the Minnesota Timberwolves for 12 seasons. The last two as the team’s vice- president of player personnel. He served as the director of player personnel from 1994–2002 and two seasons (1992–94) as a full-time scout. =Toronto Raptors= On June 7, 2004, Babcock was named as the head of the Raptors' basketball operations. Raptors star Vince Carter had preferred Julius Erving as General Manager instead. Despite Carter's personal friendship with MLSE Chairman Larry Tanenbaum, the Raptors decided to hire Babcock instead.  2004-2005 season  Babcock's first move as GM was drafting center Rafael Araujo 8th overall in the 2004 NBA Draft, a widely criticized move from the onset, considering highly touted swingman Andre Iguodala was drafted with the next pick. Araujo's disappointing play fuelled criticism of Babcock. As well, prior to the 2004-05 season, Babcock signed mercurial point guard Rafer Alston to a 5-year deal. The move backfired, with Alston reportedly threatening to retire after repeated altercations with rookie head coach Sam Mitchell. In the summer of 2005, Babcock signed Spanish point guard Jose Calderon. During the 2007-08 season, Calderon was the second most consistent player for the Raptors next to Chris Bosh, averaging over 8 assists and leading the league in assist/turnover ratio. Babcock also signed center Matt Bonner.  Vince Carter trade  Following trade rumours all season long, on December 17, 2004 Babcock traded star Vince Carter to the New Jersey Nets in exchange for Alonzo Mourning, Aaron Williams, Eric Williams and two first round draft picks. Carter's production had been declining for the Raptors since the 2000-2001 season. Mourning would never play a game for the Raptors, and shortly after the trade he was bought out by the Raptors, supposedly due to a career-threatening injury. Mourning would later sign with the Miami Heat and subsequently played a major role in their NBA Championship in 2006. The two Williams players played limited minutes for the Raptors prior to being traded in separate deals in 2006.  Other draft moves  Another Babcock pick, Joey Graham, who was drafted with one of the picks acquired from the trade with New Jersey, had a minor role on the Raptors as a bench player before leaving the team to join the Denver Nuggets in 2009. Roko Ukic was picked in the second round of the same year, and served as the primary backup behind Jose Calderon in 2008-2009. Wayne Embry had originally been hired for the 2004-05 season as the Senior Basketball Advisor to Babcock. With MLSE citing a lack of confidence in Babcock's abilities, Embry was elevated to Senior Advisor to MLSE President and CEO Richard Peddie, bypassing Babcock in the chain of command. In the 2005 NBA Draft, Babcock again defied experts by drafting Charlie Villanueva with the 7th overall pick, a move criticized by some basketball analysts. Villanueva earned NBA Rookie of the Month honors in December 2005, scored a rookie-season-high 48 points in March 2006 against the Milwaukee Bucks, and finished as runner-up in the rookie of the year award. After being traded to the Bucks, Villanueva averaged 16.7 ppg and 6.9 rpg with the Bucks in the 2008-2009 season. Babcock traded Rafer Alston to the Houston Rockets for point guard Mike James on October 4, 2005. The Raptors began the 2005-06 season losing their first 9 games and 15 out of their first 16. The team improved in December, but continued to struggle in January.  Firing from the Toronto Raptors On January 26, 2006, just a year and a half after being hired, Babcock was fired as the General Manager of the team by Maple Leafs Sports & Entertainment President and CEO Richard Peddie. In 2014, the Toronto Star has referred to Babcock's tenure as \\"the franchise's darkest days\\"http://projects.thestar.com/sports/raptors/2014/10/24/toronto_raptors_20th_season_two_decades_of_turmoil.html Babcock later explained that, \\" A lot of people thought I was too college-ish, too much of a college guy trying to establish a college atmosphere...\\".

Hugh even married in 1308 Orkney Isles Robert's sister, Matilda/Maud Bruce (c. 1287 - aft. September 1323). Aodh's young brother, Iain, was given marriage to the Margaret Comyn, heiress of Buchan (although he died childless).

This band is created at about 37 days of development in utero. The vestibular lamina forms shortly after the dental lamina and is positioned right in front of it. The vestibule is formed by the proliferation of the vestibular lamina into the ectomesenchyme. The vestibular lamina is usually contrasted with the dental lamina, which develops concurrently and is involved with developing teeth. Both the vestibular lamina and the dental lamina arise from a group of epithelial cells, called the primary epithelial band. The vestibular lamina develops at 6th week of the intrauterine life as a result of proliferation of the primitive ectoderm that lines the primitive oral cavity. The cells enlarge and then degenerate to form a cleft that separates the lips and cheeks at one side from the developing jaws and teeth at the other side. This cleft is the oral vestibule.  Development  The proliferation of the lining of the stomodeum (ectoderm) gives rise to the oral epithelium. During the initiation stage of early tooth development (6 weeks in utero), the oral epithelium goes through mitosis and condenses to form a primary epithelial band. In the 7th week in utero, the primary epithelial band cells continue to proliferate and invaginate. They then degenerate to form the vestibular sulcus that separates the lips and cheeks from the jaw and teeth, hence forming the vestibular lamina at the buccal/labial side of the oral cavity. Concurrently, the dental lamina Hovorakova, M., Lesot, H., Peterka, M. et al (2005) 'The developmental relationship between the deciduous dentition and the oral vestibule in human embryos', Brain Structure and Function, 209(4), pp 303–313. [Online]. Available at: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-004-0441-y (Accessed: 19th January 2019). is also being developed from the primary epithelial band at the lingual/palatal side of the oral cavity for morphogenesis and histogenesis of the development of the teeth. = Functions and Relationship with Dental Lamina = At about the 7th week in utero, the dental lamina is produced, and it serves as the primordium for the ectodermal portion of the deciduous teeth. Later during the development of the jaws, permanent molars arise directly from the distal extension of the dental lamina. The vestibular lamina is the thickening of oral epithelium in a facial or buccal direction from the dental lamina. Meanwhile, a cleft will form a groove that becomes the area of the mucobuccal or mucolabial fold in the future vestibule. Furthermore, vestibular lamina will subsequently hollow and forms the oral vestibule between the alveolar portion of the jaws and the lips and cheeks. Recent studies have found that both the dental lamina and vestibular laminae jointly give rise to the large tooth primordia in the cheek region of the maxilla. Also, in mice, human and sheep, the vestibular lamina and dental lamina originate from a common epithelial placode- odontogenic epithelial zone which is in the upper lip region.  Clinical Considerations  To date, there is little clinical evidence regarding the clinical implications of vestibular lamina to date. However, since the vestibular lamina is responsible for the formation of oral vestibule, a correlation might be suggested between the poor development of vestibular lamina and a number of clinical implications - namely that shallow vestibules may negatively impact on denture retention, cause difficulty in brushing teeth, and also contribute to gingival recession. = Denture Retention (secondary retention) = The surrounding musculature and the shape of denture borders and flanges may affect the degree of retention. Factors affecting denture retention may be regarded as secondary retention. In this case, a shallow vestibule may lead to resistance against proper denture fitting. Polished surfaces of the denture should therefore be properly shaped for patients with atypical oral and facial musculature. The occlusal plane should also be at the correct level to ensure that the arch form of the teeth is in the neutral zone. The denture bases are properly extended to cover the maximum area as possible. When patients encounter difficulty or discomfort chewing or brushing, vestibular deepening can be considered but this is uncommon(). = Gingival Recession = A shallow vestibule can also contribute towards gingival recession because of dissipation of the gingival attachment due to less space. Periodontal plastic surgery focuses on correction or elimination of problems related to gingival recession, shallow vestibule or lack of attached gingiva. These can either be functional or purely aesthetic procedures. Free gingival autograft is one of the more common techniques used for a gingival recession in areas of inadequate attached gingiva in the mandibular anterior region. Conversely, coronally repositioned flaps for the treatment of gingival recession will lead to decreased vestibular depth which may impact oral hygiene or denture retention.

A consistent county performer with over 25,000 runs, and \\"one of the better English openers of the 1980s\\", Roebuck captained the English county side Somerset between 1986 and 1988. During 1989, Roebuck also captained an England XI one-day cricket team in two matches. His post-playing career as an erudite writer earned him great acclaim as a journalist with the Sunday Times and later as an author. Roebuck committed suicide in Cape Town, South Africa, on 12 November 2011 after being asked by police to answer questions about an allegation of sexual assault. A book by Tim Lane and Elliot Cartledge titled Chasing Shadows – The Life and Death of Peter Roebuck was published in October 2015. Early life Roebuck was born in the village of Oddington, outside Oxford, on 6 March 1956, the son of two schoolteachers and one of six children; he attended Millfield School where his mother was a mathematics teacher and his father an economics teacher. The headmaster, Jack Meyer, a former Somerset County Cricket Club Captain, had offered his parents employment at the school so that they could afford the fees. Meyer was an unconventional headmaster who wanted to encourage cricket talent. On entering Meyer's office for the interview for admission, Roebuck found an orange flying through the air towards him; he caught it, and in his book It Never Rains speculated whether he would have got into Millfield if he had dropped it. He later studied law at Emmanuel College at the University of Cambridge, graduating with first-class honours in 1977. However he never practised law, finding it too confining. Cricket career Roebuck was a right-handed batsman, often used as an opener, and occasionally bowled right-arm offspin. He played for Somerset's second eleven at the age of 13 and regular first- class cricket from 1974 until his retirement in 1991. He later played Minor Counties cricket for Devon. In 335 first-class matches he scored 17,558 runs at an average of 37.27, making 33 centuries with a highest score of 221*, and took 72 wickets at 49.16. In 298 one-day matches, he scored 7244 runs at 29.81 while taking 51 wickets at 25.09. On the county circuit, Roebuck's nickname was Rupert. This arose when the Essex captain, Keith Fletcher, once addressed him as Rupert, in the mistaken belief that it was actually his name. In 1988 Roebuck was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. =1986 controversy= Roebuck became a controversial figure in 1986 when, at the end of his first season as captain of Somerset, he was instrumental in the county's decision not to renew the contracts of its two overseas players, Viv Richards and Joel Garner, whose runs and wickets had brought the county much success in the previous eight years. Roebuck and his supporters argued that both Richards and Garner were now ageing, that individually and collectively their contributions had declined dramatically and that younger overseas and home-grown players should be recruited to replace them. They cited the recent performance of the team in the County Championship – namely, bottom in 1985 and next-bottom in 1986 – and their failure in one-day competitions since winning the NatWest Bank Trophy in 1983. It should also be understood that a change in the TCCB (Test and County Cricket Board) regulations meant that only one overseas player would be allowed in each county team rather than two as previously – meaning that Somerset would not be able to field both Richards and Garner. Opposition to the decision not to re-employ Richards and Garner came loudest from Somerset's English-born star, the all-rounder Ian Botham, who refused a new contract for himself and joined Worcestershire. In the event, under Roebuck's captaincy and with Martin Crowe of New Zealand and Steve Waugh of Australia as overseas players, Somerset improved a little in 1987, though they remained among the weaker counties for a further six seasons. After many years of bitterness and the eventual removal of Roebuck from the club, Richards was honoured with the naming of a set of entrance gates and a stand after him at the County Ground, Taunton. Post-cricket career =Commentator and journalist= His behind-the-scenes journal of Somerset's progress during the 1983 season, It Never Rains, first established him as a talented writer on the sport. Having retired as a player and relocated to Australia, Roebuck wrote columns for The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age (Melbourne) and ESPNcricinfo, as well as commentating for the ABC radio cricket coverage in Australia. He became known for wearing his trademark straw sunhat at all times, even inside the commentary box. He felt there was too much nationalism in Australian cricket writing and that it should be avoided at all costs when analysing the game. He was one of the few global voices in the game without allegiance to any nation, team or player. A traditionalist at heart, he was one of the last journalists in cricket to acquire a laptop and mobile phone and expressed surprise and delight when he found them quite useful. Roebuck was often critical of the successful Australian cricket team and, in particular, the Australian captain Ricky Ponting. Following Australia's narrow victory in the second Test against India at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 2007–08, Roebuck accused the Australians of \\"bad sportsmanship and triumphalism\\", describing the Australian team as a \\"pack of wild dogs\\" and writing that Ponting has \\"shown not the slightest interest in the well-being of the game, not the slightest sign of diplomatic skills, not a single mark of respect for his accomplished and widely admired opponents.\\" Roebuck was described as an astute judge of cricketers, a contrarian and a master wordsmith, and his writing was described as lean, erudite, fluent, perceptive and vibrant. =Philanthropy= In 2006, Roebuck established the Learning for a Better World Trust (LBW) to help students from cricket-playing developing countries to complete tertiary education. He resigned from the Trust in 2008. In addition to supporting the LBW Trust, Roebuck spent A$100,000 of his own money to help put African youths through high school and university. Psychology Maziwisa, a Zimbabwean lawyer Roebuck had mentored and whose education he had funded, wrote a tribute in which he stated that Roebuck had over 35 Zimbabweans in his care at the time of his death, and he had spent approximately $500,000 of his own money to \\"realise African dreams\\". Personal life Roebuck spent his last years residing in Straw Hat Farm, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, as well as Bondi, Sydney, where he owned two houses. He grew increasingly estranged from England, but kept in regular touch with his mother and siblings. He became an Australian citizen. His colleague Malcolm Knox said of Roebuck that \\"nothing could rile him more, after he became an Australian citizen, than to be described as an Englishman of any kind, even a former one.\\" In 2005 Roebuck's father wrote that Peter is an \\"unconventional loner with an independent outlook on life, an irreverent sense of humour and sometimes a withering tongue.\\" Very much an introvert, he was a solitary and complex person who preferred to read a book while eating alone rather than spend time in the company of his colleagues. =Assault conviction= In 1999, while working as a commentator in South Africa, Roebuck met three cricketers, all aged 19, and offered to coach them, inviting them to live at his home in England. He warned them beforehand that he would use corporal punishment if they failed to obey his \\"house rules\\". He caned all three men on their (clothed) buttocks at different times for misbehaviour and in 2001 was given a suspended jail sentence after pleading guilty to three charges of common assault. He told the court, \\"Obviously I misjudged the mood and that was my mistake and my responsibility and I accept that.\\"\\"Cricketer sentenced for caning trainees\\", BBC News Online, 19 October 2001. Henk Lindeque, one of Roebuck's victims, stated that he held no ill will toward Roebuck and was saddened to hear of his death. Death Roebuck arrived in Cape Town, South Africa, on 7 November 2011 to report on a Test match between South Africa and Australia for The Sydney Morning Herald and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). He was staying at the Southern Sun Hotel in Newlands, Cape Town, on 12 November, when the South African Police Service entered the hotel, claiming to desire to speak to him about an alleged sexual assault on a 26-year-old Zimbabwean man. After requesting that he be allowed to go to his room to change his clothes, Roebuck called the ABC's Jim Maxwell in his hotel room and asked him to find him a lawyer and to then come to his hotel room. At 9.15 pm, Roebuck died after jumping from the sixth floor of the Southern Sun Hotel. He landed on the awning outside the entrance to the hotel, causing what was described by Australian cricket writer Peter Lalor, who later saw Roebuck's body at the mortuary, as \\"serious head trauma\\". Roebuck's body was taken to the Salt River State mortuary in the early hours of the next morning. A statement issued by South African police stated that Roebuck had committed suicide and that an inquest into the matter would be held. Students residing at Roebuck's farm in Natal, where he lived for six months of every year, stated that no corporal punishment was ever meted out at the residence. A law graduate who speaks for the housemates at Straw Hat Farm said of the sexual assault allegation: \\"This is not the Peter we knew.\\" In January 2012 Australian journalist Adam Shand published extensive research on Roebuck's dealings with the young men who lived with him in South Africa. Legacy Roebuck was Ed Cowan's mentor and former teacher at Cranbrook School. Cowan's maiden Test century came in the First Test between Australia and South Africa at the Gabba, Brisbane, on 12 November 2012, a year to the day after Roebuck's death. Cowan dedicated the century to Roebuck's memory. Biography In mid-2014 a former colleague of Roebuck's at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Tim Lane, and writer Elliot Cartledge were commissioned to research his life story and investigate the circumstances of his death. Associates of Roebuck such as Vic Marks, Steve Waugh, Ian Chappell, Jonathan Agnew and Matthew Engel are quoted. The Zimbabwean man at the centre of the controversy that led to Roebuck's death, Itai Gondo, provided testimony. The book, Chasing Shadows – The Life and Death of Peter Roebuck, was released in the UK, Australia and New Zealand in late 2015.

He was originally convicted of murder in the 2001 death of a Prentiss, Mississippi police officer Ron W. Jones, during a drug raid on the other half of Maye's duplex. Maye has said he thought that the intruders were burglars and did not realize they were police. He pleaded not guilty at his trial, citing self-defense. Nevertheless, Maye was convicted of murder and was sentenced to death. Maye's case attracted little attention until late 2005, when Reason magazine senior editor and police misconduct researcher Radley Balko brought it to light on his blog The Agitator. Balko's research raised several questions about Maye's conviction and in particular about the reliability of medical examiner Steven Hayne, who performed the autopsy on Jones and testified at the trial. According to Maye's supporters, his conviction also brought up issues such as the right to self-defense, police conduct in the War on Drugs, racial and social inequities in Mississippi and whether he received competent legal representation. On September 21, 2006, Maye's death sentence was unexpectedly overturned by Judge Michael Eubanks, who ruled that Maye had received incompetent legal representation during his sentencing phase, and ordered a new sentencing hearing. Maye was sentenced to life in prison. On November 17, 2009, the Mississippi Court of Appeals ruled that Maye's constitutional right of vicinage was violated when Judge Eubanks refused to return the case to Jefferson Davis County, where the alleged crime occurred. The en banc court reversed Maye's conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. The State of Mississippi appealed to the Mississippi Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case. On December 2, 2010, the Mississippi Supreme Court issued its decision, in which it held that Maye was entitled to a new trial on the ground that the trial court had improperly refused to issue a self-defense instruction that would have highlighted for the jury Maye's right to act in defense of his infant daughter, who was present in the home on the night of the police raid that led to the shooting. On July 1, 2011, Judge Prentiss Harrell signed a plea agreement in which Maye pleaded guilty to manslaughter; Maye was then sentenced to ten years in prison, time he had already served. Maye was transferred to Rankin County, Mississippi for procedural paperwork and out-processing and was released on July 18, 2011. Biography Maye was unemployed at the time of the raid. He and his girlfriend Chanteal had been renting a duplex apartment for less than two months and had actually occupied it for only a few weeks at the time of the raid. Maye kept their 18-month-old daughter while his girlfriend worked at her regular job. Maye had no criminal record until he was convicted of killing Jones. Death of Officer Jones At 11 p.m. on the night of December 26, 2001, Ron Jones along with other police officers and an agent employed by the Pearl River Basin Narcotics Task Force, a four-county police agency responsible for drug enforcement, went to Maye's duplex for the purpose of drug interdiction. Jones, though not a member of the task force, had received a confidential tip that large quantities of marijuana were being stored and sold in the apartment of Jamie Smith, who lived in the other half of the duplex. The officers obtained search warrants for both apartments. Whether the warrants legally allowed for a no-knock entry is still not clear. Smith was arrested without incident. Although some illicit drugs were found in his home, Maye's former attorney, Rhonda Cooper, says Smith was never charged with drug possession or distribution. They found a little more than a gram of marijuana, most of it old and ashen—at worst a misdemeanor. Jefferson Davis County District Attorney Claiborne \\"Buddy\\" McDonald says he does not remember Smith being charged or convicted. There is disagreement about what happened next. The officers then either served the warrant on Maye's half of the duplex (later, prosecutors would say both were served simultaneously) or entered what they thought was another door to Smith's in search of more contraband. Four of the officers who took part in the raid testified they knocked on Maye's door and identified themselves as law enforcement officers. Maye testified he heard neither knocks on his door nor anyone announce themselves. Maye testified he was asleep on a chair in the living room when he heard a crash, prompting him to run to his daughter's bedroom and ready a .380 caliber pistol that he kept boxed and unloaded on top of a tall headboard. When Jones entered the bedroom, Maye fired three times. Jones was wearing a bulletproof vest, but one bullet hit just below the vest, and the injury proved fatal. Jones, the son of Prentiss' then police chief, was not a regular member of the narcotics task force, but a K9 officer for the Prentiss police department. Trial testimony showed that when Jones exited the apartment and fell to the ground outside, his pistol was holstered. Trial Maye had no criminal record, and wasn't the named target of a search warrant. Police initially concluded they had found no drugs in Maye's side of the duplex, but later claimed that one smoked marijuana cigarette was in the apartment along with a plastic bag containing \\"traces\\" of the drug. The trial was held in neighboring Marion County, after Maye's lawyer successfully argued for a change of venue. But his lawyer's original request and agreement for the venue change had been to Lamar County, an adjoining county that is 88% white. When she belatedly realized her error, Maye's trial lawyer tried unsuccessfully to have the trial moved back to Jefferson Davis County. Although the trial judge refused the request to return the trial to Jefferson Davis County, he did again change the venue to Marion County where the trial was subsequently held. Of the 12 jurors subsequently selected, two were African American. Maye testified that it was dark in his apartment when he heard someone breaking into the back door, which was located in the bedroom. \\"That's when I fired the shots,\\" Maye said. \\"After I fired the shots, I heard them yell 'police! police!' Once I heard them, I put the weapon down and slid it away. I did not know they were police officers.\\" The weapon used was stolen approximately one year prior to the shooting. Maye claims it was given to him by a friend. Mississippi law indicates that it is justifiable to kill another in an act of reasonable self-defense. It also provides that the killing of a police officer is not capital murder if the killer had no knowledge that the victim was a police officer. The prosecution claimed that officers announced at the front door and then at the back door of Maye's residence. He and his lawyer say that they only identified themselves as police after he had shot Jones. The defense tried to show Maye did not know the persons breaking in were police officers, and that he was acting to protect his infant daughter in the bedroom. In mitigation the defense argued Maye's lack of a criminal record and his young age (21). The jury took five hours to convict Maye on the capital murder charge. The same afternoon, Marion County Circuit Court Judge Michael Eubanks sentenced Maye to death by lethal injection. Incarceration Maye was imprisoned in the Mississippi State Penitentiary Maye entered MDOC on January 26, 2004. He was incarcerated in the State of Mississippi's male death row in Unit 32, a part of the Mississippi State Penitentiary in Sunflower County, and later in the Delta Correctional Facility in Greenwood, Mississippi. Controversy While researching related material, columnist and blogger Radley Balko ran across Maye's case and blogged his initial findings. Other bloggers across the political spectrum picked them up. Balko wrote extensively on the Maye case, posting updates regarding Maye's court dates, findings, decisions, et al., and illustrating what he felt were the many inadequacies and errors with both the initial search of Maye's home, his legal representation, and the unfit nature of the jurors, among other complaints. Balko's attention to and prolific reporting on the case are widely credited with Maye's eventual release. =Counsel= Maye's original attorney, Rhonda Cooper, had never tried a capital murder case before she represented Maye. Maye's family fired Cooper after Maye's conviction. Maye is currently represented by Bob Evans, the original public defender in the case. Evans is the public defender for Jefferson Davis County, and was concurrently the public defender for the town of Prentiss, seat of Jefferson Davis County, until January 10, 2006, when he was fired by the Prentiss Board of Aldermen. According to the mayor of Prentiss, Charles Dumas, Evans' dismissal was directly related to his representation of Maye. The Washington, D.C., law firms of Covington & Burling, Pafford Lawrence & Ross, and the Vernia Law Firm, as well as professor Orin Kerr of The George Washington University Law School represent Maye pro bono publico. Terry R. Cox, Certified Legal Investigator (CLI) of The Lonewolf Group Legal Investigation & Consulting of Booneville, Mississippi, was engaged by Maye's counsel to assist in the post conviction investigation of the case. Cox was instrumental in tracking down the \\"unknown confidential informant\\" who acknowledged his involvement and later testified at a hearing in the matter which proved instrumental in the court setting aside the death penalty. =Discrepancies in police and court records= Since Jones died, it is impossible to know how thoroughly he investigated the tip he received before passing it along. He claimed he had observed unusually heavy traffic at the residence, but left no written record of when he made those observations (important since Maye had only moved into the apartment a few weeks before the raid). The credibility of the informant is not known beyond Jones' statement that information he had previously provided had led to a single arrest. It also appears that Jones and a colleague did not verify the tip, which is typically done by making a controlled drug buy. Jones' affidavit for the warrants names Smith but not Maye, referring only to \\"person or persons unknown\\" in the other apartment. Both apartments are described using the same language. Times have been changed on official records of when evidence was collected from both apartments. Characteristically for what was initially a major drug arrest, Smith's apartment was swept immediately afterwards. However, several changes made to the documents for Maye put the time of that evidence collection at 5:20 a.m., several hours after the raid. Maye's family and his attorney also accused officers of beating him while he was in custody after his arrest. His mug shot, taken the day of the shooting, shows Maye with a prominent swollen and discolored right eye. Officers and prosecutors denied that any beating occurred. Appeal Maye's appeal was argued before the Mississippi Court of Appeals on June 4, 2009; on November 17, 2009, the court set aside his conviction and ordered a new trial on the grounds that he was denied his right to have the trial conducted in the county of the alleged crime. On June 24, 2010, the Mississippi Supreme Court granted petitions for writ of certiorari filed by both the State of Mississippi (arguing that the Court of Appeals' decision to grant Maye a new trial was erroneous) and Maye (arguing that the Court of Appeals erred in not vacating his conviction entirely and dismissing the charges for insufficient evidence, and advancing alternative grounds for a new trial). On December 2, 2010, the Mississippi Supreme Court vacated the Court of Appeals' decision and granted Maye a new trial on the grounds that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury as Maye had requested on the nature of self-defense and defense of others (i.e., his daughter). Plea Agreement On the morning of July 1, 2011, Maye was offered and accepted a plea agreement. Judge Prentiss Harrell of the 15th Circuit Court of Mississippi signed the agreement under which Maye pleaded guilty to manslaughter in exchange for a ten-year sentence, which was decreed to be time served. Maye was then transferred to Rankin County, Mississippi for procedural paperwork and out-processing, and was released on July 18, 2011.

Though it is located in Lake Elsinore, California, it also serves the areas of Canyon Lake and Horsethief Canyon. The school was opened for the 1991–1992 school year, graduating its first class in 1994. School layout Temescal Canyon is divided into buildings labeled as \\"hundred\\"--four hundred, five hundred, etc.--and includes portable classrooms and permanent structures. The school was partially completed when it opened, but was finished in 1999. =\\"Hundred\\" Buildings= Built on what once were basketball courts, the 400 building houses numerous types of classes such as math and music appreciation. The 450 building, located on the west side of the school, houses computer labs used for freshman foundation instruction, computer classes, and English Language Development classes. The 500 building, between the 550 and 700 buildings, includes a small set of four science classrooms. The 550 building is one of the campus' two story buildings, and is the site of English, social sciences and science classes. The school's hub, the 600 building, is one of the original structures. It houses the library, media center and history and English classrooms. The math building–the 700–is also known as the Kathy Paap.PE.com  Inland Southern California  Southwest Riverside County The second two-story building on campus serves elective classes (such as ceramics, pottery and photography) and foreign language instruction. The 900 building, nestled in the back of the campus, also houses elective instruction, including materials labs, a TV studio and an auto shop. The school plant includes two gymnasia, the old Small Gym and the newer Big Gym, which was completed in 1999. The small gym is mainly used for indoor physical education and dances and is connected to the school cafeteria and the school kitchen. The Big Gym, also known as Thunderdome, is primarily used for sports like basketball and volleyball; it also houses school assemblies and pep rallies. The letters T-C-H-S are spelled out on the gym bleachers. The school has a set of three athletic fields. The softball and baseball fields are located at the northwest corner of the campus. The soccer field is located below the Big Gym, and fills the space between the baseball and football stadiums. The football stadium is located on the southwest corner of the school campus, and has been renovated with new viewing stands and synthetic turf. The administration building includes the bookkeeping office, athletic director, counseling office, career center and administrative offices usually off-limits for students. There are three parking lots, two of which are restricted for students. One is located near the 800, but the largest one is near the campus stadium, and includes spaces for office personnel and spaces reserved for seniors. These spots are randomly assigned to a certain number of seniors in a lottery-style choosing. Students who obtain these spaces must pay an extra fee but are given a special decal and are able to paint their spaces on senior paint-party day. The rest of the staff park in the lot behind the 900, which students are not allowed to use. Students have numerous places to gather during break and lunch. Due to the layout of the school, quads are formed in between the buildings. The \\"Senior Quad\\" is elevated above the walkways in the northwest corner of the 600 building and includes a tarp. The \\"Freshman Quad\\" is located right outside of the lunchroom and includes a tarp. Less busy quads are those formed at the 550 and 800 buildings. Academics The school offers the standard classes in addition to Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate (AP)(IB) courses: * World History * US History * Art History * English Literature * English Language * Physics * Chemistry * Biology * Calculus * Spanish * Government and Politics * Environmental Science * Statistics * Psychology International Baccalaureate Courses: * English Literature HL * Language B (Spanish) HL & SL * History of the Americas HL * Design and Technology HL * Chemistry SL * Biology SL * Mathematics HL & SL * Math Studies SL * Theatre HL * Visual Arts HL * Dance HL * Music HL * Theory of Knowledge In addition to AP classes, Advanced English 9 and 10 are offered, as well as honors classes.

As LEUSD's first and only high school to pursue IB World School status, TCHS officially ranks among 3,313 schools worldwide that are certified under the International Baccalaureate trademark. To receive an IB Diploma, students must pass a written exam given at the end of the program. Clubs =Associated Student Body= Temescal Canyon High School has an extraordinary, top ranking ASB Program. The Associated Student Body is responsible for planning many school events, academic recognition, teacher appreciation, Link Crew (Freshmen involvement program), and Titan Pride (including blue hole). Its leaders devote their time to make Temescal Canyon a place where all students and staff feel safe, empowered, encouraged and supported. Over the past four years, a new class was added each year resulting in four current leadership classes. The House of Representatives class is responsible for all academic recognition and execution of our Renaissance program. This class is run by Ms. Melissa Fink. The Executive Assembly class is responsible for running the ASB program, sports recognition, Titan pride, Winter Formal, pep rallies, and sound and video. This class is run by Mrs. Cari Strange. The Link Crew class is responsible for assisting the Freshmen class in transitioning to their move into high school. They strive to make the freshmen feel welcome to Temescal and support them through activities, tutoring, etc. This class is run by Mrs. Jill Carter. The Senate class is responsible for staff appreciation, special activities, peer buddies (special education program), Homecoming, community service, recycling program, and random acts of kindness (RAOK). This class is also run by Mrs. Cari Strange. Temescal Canyon's ASB program is a CADA/CASL member school and was awarded with the California Association of Student Leaders Outstanding Activities Program Award for the 2011/12 school year. The leadership program keeps growing and getting better. Through curriculum days led by Cari Strange the students are able to learn valuable life and leadership skills that they are able to apply hands on throughout their time in ASB. Leaders of this program have accomplished many great awards and been recognized in many ways. One student, Nick Fadgen, has taken his leadership to the state level and is now a member of the CASL State Board and will be representing Temescal Canyon's ASB Program while planning the CASL State Conference that has attendance of over 2000 leaders from all over California. Temescal Canyon High School has a top notch ASB program that creates a better environment on campus to be thankful for . Titan TV Titan TV is a weekly broadcast created exclusively for this school. The weekly often talks about dates on sports events, school events, and teacher interviews. The daily announcements talks about dates, clubs, E.T.C. Sports =School tradition= As in many other high schools, pep rallies are held before big games and to celebrate certain things, such as senior walk-in (the first pep rally of the year in which the senior class walks in front of the entire school wearing decorated crowns) and academics (the last pep rally of the year in which the teacher of the year and valedictorians are announced). The Titans formerly competed in the Southwestern League, but moved to the Sunbelt League, which also features rivals Elsinore High School and Lakeside High School, for the 2010/11 school year due to the school's size. =Blue Hole= The \\"Blue Hole\\", a school-wide pep club, forms a large part of Temescal Canyon student culture. Formed in 2002 by members of the football team who wanted something to do during the offseason, the Club is now an official school club open to all students. Members purchased TC-Blue T-shirts with a \\"6\\" on the back (symbolizing the 6th man) and \\"Blue Hole\\" in large, bold lettering on the front. They appear at basketball games, home and away, and sit behind the opposing team's bench. From beginning to end, they stand and chant phrases, hoping to mentally defeat the opponents as well as motivate their fellow student-athletes. Their antics include repeatedly heckling individual players with chants of \\"air ball\\", the turn-over countdown, and other attacks on play or attitude. The antics even target the officials, as poor calls are followed by boos and members dress as blind referees and parade the sidelines after a questionable call. The Southwestern League prompted new regulations prohibiting the club from sitting behind the opposition bench and name calling. The Club's rowdiness has been credited to some of the success of the boys' basketball team. The Blue Hole has also moved onto the football field, where they sit in a specially-marked \\"blue hole section\\", a seating area in which the bleachers are painted blue. Standing throughout the entire game, the Blue Hole cheers and sings, capping it all off with an \\"It's All Over\\" chant at the end of a victory. =Band= The Titan Thunder Regiment now has an extensive program including Wind Ensemble, Symphonic band, Orchestra, Marching Band, Jazz Ensemble, Small Ensemble, Color Guard, Drum Line and Percussion Ensemble. Members participate in Marching Band during the first semester and many select from one or more of the remaining ensembles and bands during the second semester. The Titan Thunder Regiment performs an original field show each year at home football games and at field show competitions in Southern California. The Regiment regularly ranks near the top of its divisions. The Titan Thunder Regiment is currently in class AA for parade band reviews, and 4A in field show competitions and tournaments. As of the end of the season in 2017, the Marching Regiment is the 9th best high school parade band in Southern California. =CIF= •The football team won back-to-back victories in the CIF Championships of 1995 and 1996. •The 2010/11 wrestling team recorded a team record of 21 wins and no losses, leading to an undefeated CIF victory. •The 2011/12 girls' water polo team went on to win a back to back CIF Championship. •The wrestling team earned their second CIF-SS title in 2013 beating Rowland High School in the Division 3 Dual Meet Wrestling Championship. •In 2015, The girls' soccer team won their very first CIF-SS title against league rivals Paloma Valley with the score of 2-1 at the Division 6 CIF-SS Championship. •In 2017, the boys' water polo team won CIF undefeated and is undefeated through eight league seasons. •In 2017, the girls' tennis team won the CIF championship against Orange. =Fall Season (September–November)= * Football * Marching band * Girls' volleyball * Cross country * Girls' golf * Girls' tennis * Boys' water polo =Winter Season (December–February)= * Girls' water polo * Boys' basketball * Girls' basketball * Girls' soccer * Boys' soccer * Wrestling =Spring Season (March–May)= * Boys' golf * Baseball * Softball * Boys' track and field * Girls' track and field * Boys' swimming * Girls' swimming * Boys' tennis Notable alumni * Tom Malone (1998–2002) – Punter for the USC Trojans and the St. Louis Rams * Norman Xiong (2014-2017) References External links *Official Temescal Canyon High School website *Official Titan Thunder Regiment website * Category:High schools in Riverside County, California Category:Public high schools in California ","title":"Temescal Canyon High School (Lake Elsinore, California)"},{"id":"3414289","text":" ","title":"Trollop"},{"id":"3414295","text":"alt=“Pretty Mouth and Green My Eyes” is a short story by J.D. Salinger, initially published in the July 1951 issue of The New Yorker, and later within the larger collection of Salinger’s short works, Nine Stories (April, 1953). Over the span of a few telephone conversations, the story surrounds three adult characters and the remainder of their evening after leaving a party. Plot summary  The story opens with a phone ringing in Lee's apartment somewhere in New York. Sitting beside Lee is a young, blue-eyed woman. The two of them had been sitting and smoking together when Arthur calls, a colleague of his, drunkenly concerned with where his wife is. Arthur later refers to his wife by her name, Joanie. All of whom had just attended a party just hours previously before the phone call occurs. Arthur goes through a scatter of out- loud thought and questions addressed to Lee, accompanied with a roller-coaster of emotions. Arthur's main concern is the whereabouts of his wife, even though he appears to regret his marriage to her. He later expresses a concern with his job at the law firm. Lee attempts at talking some sense into Arthur throughout the conversation, while Arthur continuously interrupts him. All the while Lee is on the phone, the girl he's accompanied by is smoking and exchanging looks with him. Lee tries to reassure Arthur that his wife will probably arrive at any minute and that he should try to pull himself together before she walks in. Although neither the narrator nor the three characters explicitly confirm this, the girl Lee is with is implied to be Arthur's wife, Joanie. This connection isn't drawn until Arthur refers to Joanie's eyes as seashells. The phone call eventually tails off with Lee convincing Arthur to get some rest. The young woman and Lee exchange a few words and continue to smoke when they're interrupted again by another phone call. It's Arthur again, letting Lee know that Joanie just walked in and that everything's alright. Arthur talks a little while longer explaining how he'd like to move to Connecticut with Joanie and practically contradicts everything he had just said in the previous phone call. Lee interrupts Arthur and explains that he has to go due to a headache with unexplained origins. Lee hangs up and the conversation ends abruptly, and in this way so does the story.  Themes  An overarching theme that is frequently discussed is infidelity. Although not completely explicit, the reader is left to infer that Joanie is the young girl with Lee as well as Arthur's spouse that's being searched for. This theme is even stretched to Salinger's own personal life, English Professor Dr. Brett Weaver argues, \\"Joanie is based on Salinger's one-time girlfriend Oona O'Neill who threw him over for Charlie Chaplin, and that 'Pretty' is Salinger's revenge for his broken heart.\\"  Reception and interpretation  There has been practically no critical reception for \\"Pretty Mouth and Green My Eyes.\\" Author John V. Hagopian acknowledges that the most commentary that's been made is \\"three paragraphs by David L. Stevenson, [comparing] the story...with Hemingway's 'The Short, Happy Life of Francis Macomber.'\\" Hagopian professes \\"Pretty Mouth\\" as \\"lucid, controlled, and beautifully-formed.\\" The story receives most mention through inclusions in anthologies of Salinger's work, or other similar anthologies like Famous American Stories by Angus Burrell. However, all that's noted of the story in Burrell's anthology is a short synopsis. Other few acknowledgements are only interpretive. Author James Lundquist states \\"Pretty Mouth\\" is, \\"a story that disintegrates into pathos and, uncharacteristically, is without any healing sympathy.\\" French author and artist Camille Bourniquel explains the story to be \\"an urbanized tale of the managerial set [consisting] of two telephone conversations.\\"  References  Category:1953 short stories Category:Short stories by J.

It was a New York Times \\"Notable Book\\" and chosen by Time as one of ten best books of 1995. Plot summary This is a novel about a woman, Delia Grinstead, who finds her own self-identity and battles with familial relationships. As a spontaneous act of deep sadness and anger, she walks out on her family during a beach vacation. Not only does she put herself in a dire financial situation, she also places herself in a psychologically damaging situation with her family and husband. The narrative follows her as she deals with entering the workforce and considering what is most important in her life. As she deals with these issues, she comes to terms with herself. Cathleen Schine, in her 1995 review in The New York Times, analyzes Delia—and the dilemma Tyler has created for her—in this manner: \\"If the reader is never quite sure why Delia deserts her life, neither is Delia herself. All she can say to explain herself when her family finally tracks her down is, 'I'm here because I just like the thought of beginning again from scratch.' [She] strips herself bare and exiles herself in the scrappy little town of Bay Borough, and it is she who tests the love of her family, she who waits for a declaration. The novel examines marriage—there are all sorts of marriages Delia comes across in her adventures, good and bad—as well as aging and independence, but finally it is a book about choice. All those years ago, Sam chose Delia, the youngest sister, the one on the right. But whom did Delia choose? Pulled yet repelled by her past, by her complicated and idiosyncratic family, and lured by a new town with a new complicated and idiosyncratic family, what will Delia choose now?\\"Schine, Cathleen (May 7, 1995) “New Life for Old,” New York Times. Title Nat Moffat, Noah's grandfather, describes his retirement home, Senior City, to Delia: \\"We're organized on the vertical. Feebler we get, higher up we live. Floor below this one is hale-and-hearty....Fourth floor is total care. Nurses, beds with railings....Something about the whole setup strikes me as uncomfortably, shall we say, symbolic. See, I've always pictured life as one of those ladders you find on playground sliding boards-a sort of ladder of years where you climb higher and higher, and then, oops! you fall over the edge and others move up behind you.\\" Tyler, Anne (1995) Ladder of Years, New York: Ballantine Books, p. 193-4. Reviews * Cathleen Schine \\"New Life for Old\\", New York Times (May 7, 1995), writes, \\"The French have said that William Wyler, the great director of movies like Dodsworth and The Best Years of Our Lives, had a \\"style sans style.\\" Anne Tyler has this same deceptive \\"style without a style.\\" Opening one of her books in the middle and picking a page at random, a reader might not immediately recognize her individual rhythm or idiosyncratic temperament. She does nothing fancy, nothing tricky. But so rigorous and artful is the style without a style, so measured and delicate is each observation, so complex is the structure and so astute and open the language, that the reader can relax, feel secure in the narrative and experience the work as something real and natural—even inevitable.\\" * Kirkus Reviews writes, \\"All of Tyler's trademarks are here: comedy, the sweet, blunt edges of romance, and characters so perfectly, achingly drawn you can never decide whether they're the most oddball or most everyday people you've ever come across. Despite all this, Delia's story begins to feel slightly unfocused -- it pulls our sympathies every which way. There are allusions here to both King Lear and to fairy tales, but the ending to Delia's adventure is neither tragedy nor happily ever after, but something awkwardly in-between. Still, any journey with Tyler is always worth the ride -- and then some.\\" Kirkus Reviews (May 3, 1995) Ladder of Years, posted on line, May 20, 2010.

In this way the dream remains \\"alive\\" whereas if it has been assigned a specific meaning, it is \\"finished\\" (i.e., over and done with). Dreamworkers take the position that a dream may have a variety of meanings depending on the levels (e.g. subjective, objective) that are being explored. A belief of dreamwork is that each person has his or her own dream \\"language\\". Any given place, person, object or symbol can differ in its meaning from dreamer to dreamer and also from time to time in the dreamer's ongoing life situation. Thus someone helping a dreamer get closer to her or his dream through dreamwork adopts an attitude of \\"not knowing\\" as far as possible. In dreamwork it is usual to wait until all the questions have been asked—and the answers carefully listened to—before the dreamworker (or dreamworkers if it is done in a group setting) offers any suggestions about what the dream might mean. In fact, a dreamworker often prefaces any interpretation by saying, \\"if this were my dream, it might mean...\\" (a technique first developed by Montague Ullman, Stanley Krippner, and Jeremy Taylor and now widely practiced). In this way, dreamers are not obliged to agree with what is said and may use their own judgment in deciding which comments appear valid or provide insight. If the dreamwork is done in a group, there may well be several things that are said by participants that seem valid to the dreamer but it can also happen that nothing does. Appreciation of the validity or insightfulness of a comment from a dreamwork session can come later, sometimes days after the end of the session. Dreamwork or dream-work can also refer to Sigmund Freud's idea that a person's forbidden and repressed desires are distorted in dreams, so they appear in disguised forms. The distorting processes in operation can take various form but are referred to, generally, as dreamwork or dream-work.  Psychodynamic perspective  Sigmund Freud's theory of psychoanalysis is largely based on the importance of the unconscious mind. According to the theory, the unconscious does not only affect a person during the day, but also in dreams. In the psychodynamic perspective, the transferring of unconscious thoughts into consciousness is called dreamwork (). In dreams, there are two different types of content, the manifest and latent content. The latent content is the underlying, unconscious feelings and thoughts. The manifest content is made up of a combination of the latent thoughts and it is what is actually being seen in the dream. According to Carl Jung's principle of compensation, the reason that there is latent content in dreams is that the unconscious is making up for the limitations of the conscious mind. Since the conscious mind cannot be aware of all things at once, the latent content allows for these hidden away thoughts to be unlocked. Psychoanalysts use the knowledge of the process of dreamwork to analyze dreams. In other words, the clinician will study the manifest content to understand what the latent content is trying to say.Introduction to Sigmund Freud’s Theory on Dreams  Process  According to psychoanalytic view to be able to understand dreamwork fully, a person needs to understand how the mind transfers the latent thoughts to manifest. The first step is called condensation, and it is the combining of different unconscious thought into one. The combining of the unconscious thoughts makes it easier for the mind to express them in the dream. The step of condensation has two sub-steps, day residues and censorship. (On the other hand, according to Ullman and Erich Fromm dreams have no censorship at all). Day residues are left over daily issues that bring up some unconscious thought. The mind then displays this thought through a similar situation from the day.Teaching Clinical Psychology - Working (and playing) with Dreams Before the unconscious thoughts can be displayed they are censored. Since many unconscious thoughts do not follow the moral code of society, the mind changes them to be more respectful. This is done so that it does not cause the dreamer anxiety and therefore wake them up. It is also due to censorship that multiple unconscious thoughts are combined, since it is hard to just have one slip through.Freud Museum ~ Education After condensation, another step in the formation of dreams is displacement. This is where the dream may direct feelings or desires onto an unrelated subject. This is similar to the practice of transference, which is a common technique used in psychoanalysis. Another step in the formation of dreams is symbolism. Objects or situations in a dream may represent something else, commonly an unconscious thought or desire. The fourth and final step in formation is secondary revision. In this step, all the thoughts are put together and are made coherent. Also another point of this step is to make the dream relate to the dreamer. These four steps put together make up dreamwork. Dreamworkers  People who study the formation of dreams and then analyze them are called dreamworkers. As mentioned before, dreamworkers must work backwards from the conscious to the unconscious. Since they are not the ones who saw the dream, they use among a variety of methods, depending on the background of the dreamworker, also free association with their clients. Free association is where the client describes the dream and relates as many aspects of it to their life as possible. The dreamworker listens intently and once they have gained as much information as possible about the dream both through the dreamer's description of the dream and through the dreamer's emotional status, they may be able to understand the dream better and to gain information about the dreamer that they may not be aware of or be willing to share.

Flavell regained his All Black place in 2006 with two tests against Ireland before being injured for the rest of the season. He was named captain of the Blues for the 2007 Super 14 season and was considered the outstanding forward of the Super 14, subsequently regaining his All Black Jersey. He played in the first five tests of the 2007 season. However he was left out of the All Black 2007 Rugby World Cup squad, being replaced by Sione Lauaki. Many people, including Zinzan Brooke considered this to be a bad decision.

History In 1976, Compagnie générale des mines was created based on the uranium production activities of Commissariat à l'énergie atomique (CEA). Later it was renamed Compagnie Générale des Matières Nucléaire (COGEMA). As of 1999, COGEMA was majority owned by CEA (81.5%) with minority owned by Total S.A. (15%) and Technip (3.5%). It also owned stakes in Framatome and Eramet. In June 2001, Cogema became a part of the Topco group which was renamed Areva in September 2001. In 2006, Cogema became Areva NC and began the construction of a new uranium enrichment plant at the Tricastin nuclear site. In 2008, Areva NC launched the Comurhex II projects for new uranium conversion plants at Malvési and [Tricastin sites in France. . Operations Areva NC is based in France and with its subsidiaries has a presence in more than 30 countries. It employs approximately 19,000 people worldwide. In France, it operates the reprocessing plant at La Hague, the Marcoule nuclear site, the Pierrelatte nuclear site (Tricastin nuclear site) and the Cadarache center. Orano Cycle has uranium reserves in Niger, Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan. The last mine operation in France, La Société des Mines de Jouac, closed in 2001 when its reserves ran out. =Niger= Concessions Areva NC's Niger operations consist of three concessions near the town of Arlit, runs as joint ventures with (minority) stakeholders from the Nigerien government and smaller foreign investors.

According to Le Canard enchaîné, this move from Seyni Oumarou's government was motivated by negotiations concerning the uranium trade agreement, which was finally renewed on 1 August 2007. Furthermore, Laouel Kader Mahamadou, who had resigned from his functions as secretary general of the Nigerien government to take a consulting job with Areva-Niger, was asked by the Nigerian DGSE to remain in Niger instead of flying to France for an integration workshop until a \\"clarification of the situation\\" could be obtained.\\"Conflit armé dans le nord.

Prior to this, Areva also gained a concession in nearby Imouraren, which is hoped to double or triple their production in Niger.

Despite the violence in the Aïr Massif, Areva NC and the Nigerien government were by later 2008 unhindered in their exploitation of the Arlit uranium mines and in the transport of its product by highway to ports in Benin. Imouraren mine At the beginning of 2009, Niger and the French state mining company agreed a deal to build near Arlit the Imouraren mine. Areva would hold a 66% stake to the Nigerien mining office's 33%. At a projected output of five thousand tonnes of ore a year, it would be largest uranium mine in the world by 2012, as the SOMAIR and COMINAK mines are phased out. The deal would make Niger the second largest uranium producer in the world, and included plans to construct a civil nuclear power station for Niger.\\"Uranium-rich Niger eyes nuclear power generation\\".

There has been speculation that Areva was the primary vehicle (and motivation) for French government involvement in the Nigerien government's poor history of democracy and human rights since the late 1960s. Areva argues that it is a good steward of the environment and a partner in development with the Nigerien people. The company stresses that most workers it directly employs in Niger are locals, and that the revenue generated by these mines is the single largest foreign exchange source for Niger.Two examples include: 24 October 2007 Update on deployment of AREVA health-watch programs. 13 January 2008 AREVA strengthens its presence in Niger with the signing of a win-win partnership agreement . When the population of Niger was exposed to a serious famine in 2005, Areva donated 130,000 euros in June 2005 to the food crisis coordination group of Niger, and 120,000 euros in July in the form of two planes loaded with food and organized by Bernard Kouchner's Réussir NGO. Nigerien critics point out that this aid amounted to 0.05% of Areva's annual profits of 428 million euros.

Career Ghisliero was from an upper class Bolognese family. He listed his profession as \\"soldier,\\" not master-at-arms. He died at Turin in 1619 after a distinguished military career. Ghisliero apparently wrote other material besides Regole and was a mathematician. His other works on siege warfare, fortification, and artillery were unfortunately lost in a 1904 fire in Italy. Dr. Sydney Anglo recounts that Galileo himself appears to have spent an evening at Ghisliero's home. Theories by Ghisliero The geometrical concepts in Ghisliero's treatise are explained by the use of a series of concentric circles, with the center being the duelist's back foot (which was usually the foot on which the majority of one's weight rested in most of the systems of the time). Each concentric circle expanded out from the center by the length of one pace. There were also crossing lines, which shared their common midpoint with the central point of the concentric circles. These crossing lines pointed forward, backward, right, and left, relative to the fencer. Some fencing historians have hypothesized that Ghisliero's use of geometry evidences the influence of the Spanish school (La Verdadera Destreza). However, though the use of geometry is common to both systems, The Spanish School conceived of a single circle between both fencers. Also, Jeronimo de Carranza, the father of the Spanish school, was heavily influenced by Camillo Agrippa's application of geometry to combat in his book, entitled Trattato di Scientia d'Arme, which also incorporated the idea of a circle that encircled both duelists. Thus, it is possible that Ghisliero's system was influenced purely by Italian sources. The terminology Ghisliero uses in his treatise is the fencing terminology used by his Italian contemporaries (e.g. Mandritto, Riverso, Fendente, Stoccata, et al.), curiously though, Ghisliero used a combination of guard names from various 16th-century Italian schools including some associated with Bolognese Swordsmanship and some of its close relatives (e.g. Guardia di Testa, Guardia di Faccia, and Guardia di Falcone) and the four rotational hand positions from Camillo Agrippa's manual. However, this seemingly arbitrary selection of terminology is not particularly unusual for Italian systems of swordsmanship from the 16th century (for an illustration of this, compare the terminology used by Achille Marozzo with that used by Francesco Altoni). Like the other systems of swordsmanship prevalent in Europe at the time, Ghisliero's system emphasized the use of the thrust over the cut. He also wrote on the use of the dagger, and the cloak in combination with the sword, which were mainstays of civilian dress, and were often discussed in manuals of the time, especially those related to the Italian school. He was noted by Luis Pacheco de Narváez, a major proponent of the Spanish school, as being one of ten leading experts on mounted combat in Europe at the time. Ghisliero wrote other treatises on artillery, siege warfare and more, however many of these works are now lost. More about him can be found at , where a discussion of his work is given, based on the work of Dr. Sydney Anglo.

The Recollects were expelled by the British in 1629. The seigneury then passed to the Jesuits in late 1629, after the return of the friars to France following the capitulation of Quebec to the Kirk brothers by Champlain on 14 September 1629. The property was returned to the Recollects upon their return to New France in 1670, at which time they dedicated their house to Notre-Dame-des-Anges (Our Lady of the Angels), so named for the first community of the Franciscan Order. In 1692, it was purchased by Jean-Baptiste de Saint-Vallier, Bishop of Quebec, to found a hospital, which he did the subsequent year. In 1722, it was established as a civil parish and in 1855, the parish municipality was officially founded with the goal of protecting its sole occupant, the Hôpital général de Québec, from taxes.

A fighter is trying to take down or \\"sweep\\" his rival with a leg hook. Shuai Jiao () is the term pertaining to the ancient jacket wrestling wushu style of Beijing, Tianjin and Baoding of Hebei Province in the North China Plain which was codified by Shan Pu Ying (善撲营 The Battalion of Excellency in Catching) of the Nei Wu Fu (内務府, Internal Administration Unit of Imperial Household Department). In modern usage it is also the general Mandarin Chinese term for any form of wrestling, both inside and outside China. As a generic name, it may be used to cover various styles of wrestling practised in China in the form of a martial arts system or a sport. The art was introduced to Southern China in the Republican era (see Republic of China (1912–1949)) after 1911. History Six Shuai Jiao masters in Tianjin, 1930. Over 6,000 years ago, the earliest Chinese term for wrestling, \\"jǐao dǐ\\" (角抵, horn butting), refers to an ancient style of military Kung-Fu in which soldiers wore horned headgear with which they attempted to butt, throw and defeat their enemies. Ancient Chinese imperial records state that \\"jiao di\\" was used in 2697 BC by the soldiers of a rebel army led by Chiyou against the Yellow Emperor's army. In later times, young people would play a similar game, emulating the contests of domestic cattle, without the headgear. Jiao di has been described as an originating source of wrestling and latter forms of martial arts in China. An ancient chinese belt plaque, depicting two dismounted horsemen, engaged in a wrestling match, circa 2nd century BC \\"Jiao li\\" (角力) was first referenced in the Classic of Rites during the Zhou Dynasty. Jiao li supplemented throwing techniques with strikes, blocks, joint locks and attacks on pressure points. These exercises were practiced in the winter by soldiers who also practiced archery and studied military strategy. Jiao li eventually became a public sport held for court amusement as well as for recruiting the best fighters. Competitors wrestled each other on a raised platform called a \\"lei tai\\" for the potential reward of being hired as a bodyguard to the emperor or a martial arts instructor for the Imperial Military. Jiao li was taught to soldiers in China over many centuries and its popularity among the military guaranteed its influence on later Chinese martial arts through the end of the Qing dynasty. The term \\"shuai jiao\\" was chosen by the Central Guoshu Academy (Zhong Yang Guo Shu Guan 中央國術館) of Nanjing in 1928 when competition rules were standardized . The art continues to be taught in the police and military academies of China. Translation A wrestling match during the Tang Dynasty. The word \\"shuai,\\" 摔, stands for \\"to throw onto the ground\\", while \\"jiao\\" may be one of two characters: the first and older, 角, stands for \\"horns\\" and the second and recent, 跤, stands for \\"wrestle or trip using the legs\\". In modern Chinese Shuai Jiao is always written using the more recent characters 跤, and should be translated as \\"to throw onto the ground through wrestling with legs\\". The use of the character 角 is because in the earliest form of Shuaijiao, players wore helmet with horns and head-butting was allowed. This form of Shuaijiao is called 'Ciyou Xi'. Styles of Shuaijiao The practice of Jiao li in the Zhou Dynasty was recorded in the Classic of RitesClassic of Rites. Chapter 6, Yuèlìng. Line 108. Shuaijiao can be divided into the following styles: Zhili (直隷) or Hebei (河北) Style. This style traces the lineage to the Yellow Emperor who fought two decisive battles against Chi You and Yan Emperor in modern-day Zhang Jia Kou (张家口) Region in Northern Hebei, to the NW of Beijing. The modern training methods and rules are codified by Shan Pu Ying (善撲营 The Battalion of Excellency in Catching) of the Nei Wu Fu (内務府, Internal Administration Unit of Imperial Household Department). It comprises Beijing, Tianjin and Baoding styles, listed below. Wrestlers wear a jacket called Da Lian. Beijing Style (北京) - This is in essence the lineage from the Manchu Buku style that was practised by the Imperial Guards Brigade, Shan Pu Ying (善扑营, literally the Expert in Wrestling Unit). The main characteristic is the use of the legs to kick and off-balance opponents, and the use of arm locks. Tianjin Style (天津) - This is the lineage of Ming Dynasty Shuaijiao mixed with Manchu Buku (布庫). The main characteristic is the use of legs to kick and off-balance, and the use of forearms in blocking and striking. Baoding Style (保定) - This is the lineage that is called Kuai Jiao (快跤) or \\"Fast Wrestling\\". The main characteristic is the fast application of technique. Another characteristic is the adaptation of Shaolin Quan from Ping Jingyi, a famous teacher of Shuaijiao who learned Shaolin style from the Meng family of Nanguan County even though he was a Muslim Hui. Qing Dynasty match, a man has taken control of his rival and is about to throw him off a lei tai. Shanxi Style (山西) - This is the lineage of Song Dynasty Shuaijiao. It is mainly practised in the counties between the mining city of Datong in northern Shanxi and the provincial capital Taiyuan in central Shanxi. The main characteristic is leg catching techniques, as traditionally wrestlers wear only tight knee-length pants. Mongolian Style - This style traces its lineage to the wrestling styles of the Dong Hu (东胡) Confederation, which included Xianbei, Khitan and Mongol people.

He was the fifth O’Beolan earl of Ross, descending from the founder of the line, Fearchar of Ross (or Fearchar MacTaggart). Biography William was the son of Aodh (Hugh), 4th Earl of Ross, and his wife Matilda Bruce, daughter of Robert de Bruce, 6th Lord of Annandale. He was first cousin to David II, king of Scotland, through his mother, who was a sister of Robert the Bruce. William was in Norway at the time of his father's death at the Battle of Halidon Hill in 1333, but returned in 1336 and took possession of the earldom. Soon after his return, the earl undertook the rebuilding of the ruinous Fearn Abbey, which had been founded by Fearchar MacTaggart in the previous century. The life of William, Earl of Ross, is closely entwined with the political and military events of the reign of David II, who was ever vigilant to repel the English as they undertook to expand their influence in Scotland. In 1339, the English, in support of Edward Baliol's claim to the Scottish crown, had planted themselves in Perth, and the earl played a key role in David's siege of Perth. Aware that the defensive channel of water around the town made it difficult for the Scots to enter the city, Ross and his men diverted the waters and filled in the ditch with driftwood, giving them access to the city walls. At this point, the English decided to give up the cause and pulled out. In 1342, Ross granted a charter for ten davochs (about 4,160 acres or 104 Scots acres) of land in Kintail to Ronald MacRuari (Raghnall MacRuaidhrí), Lord of the Isles, a descendant of Somerled. In 1346, David summoned his earls and their men to gather at Perth in advance of an incursion into England. However, before the assembled army pulled out, William became embroiled in a dispute with his vassal Ronald MacRuari and killed him at the priory of Elcho. Fearing repercussions, the earl pulled back to the safety of his own territories, and many other northern lords followed suit. David continued south into England where he was taken captive in Durham for what turned out to be a period of eleven years. While David was imprisoned, Earl William undertook additional measures that ultimately would alienate the king, as evidenced by court records showing that he seized all the proceeds of the court in 1348. However, in 1349, David, while still in captivity, was still relying on William in his role as justiciar of Scotland north of the Forth, by asking him to attend to a matter involving William de Deyn, Bishop of Aberdeen, in his conflict with William of St. Michael, who had seized some property of the Church. This case was resolved in Aberdeenshire at one of the courts which were still being held at the ancient Stone Circles of northern Scotland. Nonetheless, William's behavior at the priory of Elchor, combined with his less than honorable behavior in 1348, had eroded the king's trust in him, and by 1355 he had been replaced as justiciar. In 1357, Earl William attended the session of Parliament where plans for the ransom of David II were discussed. Accordingly, on 3 October, the king of Scotland was finally released at Berwick on the condition that the ransom payment be secured by the taking of twenty hostages, with Earl William (or possibly his young son) named as one of the six noblemen to serve as hostages on a rotating basis. Upon David's return to Scotland, he imposed heavy taxation on his nobles in order to pay his ransom, a move which led to a rebellion of the Highland lords, including William and his half-brother, Hugh de Rarichies, in 1366. In 1368, Ross and the others were required to find security to keep the peace. Near the end of his life, William was forced to change the entail on his earldom. His only son, William, was a sickly lad, and the earl was well aware that if the boy died, leaving him without a male heir, the earldom would pass out of the Mactaggart family. To prevent this from coming to pass, he consulted with his sister Marjory, Countess of Caithness and Orkney, who consented to entailing the earldom to their half-brother, Hugh of Rarichies. This arrangement, which happened in 1350, would have had the effect of preserving the earldom in the Mactaggart family. Although young William was named in 1354 as one of the hostages for the king's ransom, records show that by August 1357 he was quite ill and must have died soon after. Indeed, in 1357, young William died, but fourteen years later, King David, never fond of William for his earlier bad decisions, ripped the earldom out of the Mactaggart line. Instead of agreeing that Hugh of Rarichies would succeed William, the king settled the earldom on William's daughter, Euphemia, and then forced her to marry Walter de Leslie, who had made a name for himself fighting with the king of France, with the Holy Roman Emperors in the Northern Crusades, and with Peter of Cyprus on his Alexandrian Crusade. David II wished to reward this internationally renowned Scotsman for his bravery by settling an earldom on him. To this end, at Perth on 23 October 1370, David took the step of re-confirming William in the earldom of Ross and lordship of Skye, but only with the unwelcome stipulation that he must give his daughter in marriage to Leslie. Though Ross planned to seek help through the chancellor, he was stopped by the forces of Walter Leslie, who waylaid and attacked his emissaries. In 1371, after King David died, William appealed to Robert II, whom he had fought with at the Siege of Perth when Robert was High Steward of Scotland, but to no avail. William, Earl of Ross, died on 9 February 1372 at Denley in Ross-shire, the last of the O’Baleon earls of Ross. He was succeeded by his daughter Euphemia and her husband Walter de Lesley. Family William, 5th Earl of Ross, married first Mary (Máire), a daughter of Angus Og of Islay (Aonghus Óg Mac Domhnaill), (d. 1314×1318/c.1330), chief of Clan Donald (Clann Domhnaill). They had one son and two daughters: * William, d. 1357. * Euphemia, Countess of Ross, married Walter de Lesley, who became Earl of Ross in her right. * Joanna (or Janet), married in 1375 Sir Alexander Fraser of Cowie, ancestor of the Lords Saltoun of the Fraser line; d. before 1400.

During his life he taught in various European countries, most notably in Denmark where he was the fencing instructor of King Christian IV.In 1686, Francesco Antonio Marcelli states in his Regole della Scherma, p. 12: Salvador Fabris [...] was teacher to the King of Denmark. It was during his time in Copenhagen that he published his treatise on rapier fencing, Lo Schermo, overo Scienza d’Arme, in 1606. The treatise became a fencing bestseller around Europe, and was reprinted until 1713 and translated into several languages, notably into German, and again in 2005, into English. His treatise, first published by Henrico Waltkirch, is also regarded as one of the finest examples of baroque printing, with its 191 copperplate engravings by Jan van Haelbeck, Francesco Valeggio and possibly other artists. This book is also important to bibliophiles because it is the first Danish book to feature copperplate engravings.Richard Cammel, Philobiblon, 1936. Fabris was also the Supreme Knight of the Order of the Seven Hearts, a chivalrous order of which we do not yet know much today. The order's insignia, consisting of seven hearts arranged in a cross pattern surmounted by a phoenix bird, are visible on the left breast of Fabris' only extant portrait (see illustration). The wording \\"Supreme Knight of the Order of the Seven Hearts\\" is coupled with the author's name in all editions of Fabris' work, indicating that it must have been a point of importance.  Life  Salvator Fabris was born in 1544 in or around Padua, and his youth coincided with the flowering of the Italian school of swordsmanship, with early Italian masters like Achille Marozzo, Angelo Viggiani and Giacomo di Grassi still teaching. Although it is not known from whom he learned fencing, his statement of \\"having had considerable experience\\"Scienza d'Arme, Note to the reader. may suggest his having studied under more than one master. He worked as a fencing master in Italy as well as in Northern Europe. The French master Henry de Sainct-Didier in 1573 mentions a meeting with a young fencer by the name of \\"Fabrice\\" while he was in the process of writing his own treatise, though there is nothing to prove that Fabris and Fabrice are the same man.Henry de Sainct Didier, Traicte [...] sur l'espee seule, 1573. But we are on sure footing when we find Fabris in the service in Johan Frederik of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, archbishop of Bremen and cousin to the King of Denmark, in the 1590s. It was during his years with the Archbishop that Fabris composed his treatise Scienza e Prattica d'Arme (of knowledge and practice of arms), although the book would be first published under the title Lo Schermo, overo Scienza D'Arme (on fencing, or martial knowledge). The book was first presented to the Archbishop in handwritten form, with drawings of fencing positions and actions. This precious manuscript now resides at the Library of Copenhagen. After employment with the Archbishop, Salvator entered the service of the king of Denmark, Christian IV from 1601 to 1606. It was the King himself who sponsored the publication of the treatise, putting his Flemish court artist, Jan van Haelbeck, as well as others like Valeggio (whose signature also appears in the book's plates) at Fabris' disposal to refine the drawings of the book's handwritten edition. Fabris left the King's employment in 1606, and after traveling across Europe, returned to Italy, teaching at the University of Padua. His renown at its peak, young noblemen from all over Europe came to Padua to be taught by him. He died in 1618 after fighting against malignant fever for about 10 days.City of Padua, Archivi della Sanita', entry on Fabris' death. He was 74. According to Hynitzsch, the editor of the 1676 German-Italian parallel edition of Fabris' treatise, on his deathbed, he bestowed his salle to senior student Herman, a German, who was later assassinated by a jealous colleague by the name of Heinrich. Jacopo Gelli, a 19th-century fencing historian, states that a monument was erected in honor of the Master in his native town.Jacopo Gelli, Bibliografia Generale della Scherma, Florence, 1890. This monument was shown by Hynitzsch in 1676 as being under construction. Modern Fabris researchers have so far been unable to find other references to it.  Fabris' Fencing Treatise: the Scienza D'Arme  Page from De lo Schermo overo Scienza d'Arme, engraving by Jan van Haelbeck In his treatise, Lo Schermo, overo Scienza D'Arme (1606) Fabris deals with sword alone, sword and dagger, sword and cape as well as bare-handed fighting against a man armed with a dagger. Fabris also includes a Book II consisting on ways to defeat an opponent without stopping in guard, a unique occurrence among 17th-century Italian extant fencing treatises. In raw number of pages and illustrations, Fabris is the 17th century fencing master who, after thoroughly describing the use of the single sword, devotes the longest sections to sword and dagger and sword and cape. The Scienza D'Arme is structured as follows: BOOK I Sword Alone *Fencing theory: dealing with the four guards, the sword and its parts, how to close the line, thrusting and cutting attacks, defences, voiding actions, engagements and disengagements, feints, invitations, measure, tempo and contratempo, arm and body posture. *Fencing tactics: dealing with how a tall man should face a short man and vice versa, or a strong a weak, or a cool- tempered a rash one. *Illustrations of the main guards, the main invitations, the thrusts and the voids. *Illustrations of the main actions using the theory presented before: progressive instruction starting on how to take the tempo, going through how to parry and riposte in a single motion, touching on the four hand-parries and the voids, and ending on how to defeat these. Sword and Dagger *Theory on the use of the sword and dagger (building on sword alone): how to properly close the line, how to engage the opponent's weapon, how to deal with opponents who stand in guard with a different foot forward, how to practice parrying with the dagger. *Illustrations of the main guards of sword and dagger, the main invitations, the thrusts and the voids. *Illustrations of the main actions using the sword and dagger, in a similar progression as that presented in the theory section. Sword and Cape *Theory on the use of the sword and cape: how to hold the cape, what the cape's strengths and weaknesses are, how to parry, etc. *Illustrations of the main guards of sword and cape, the main invitations, the thrusts, the defenses and the voids. *Illustrations of the main actions using the sword and cape, in a similar progression as that presented in the theory section. BOOK II On Proceeding Against the Opponent Without Stopping in Guard *Theory and benefits. Part 1: Sword Alone *Six techniques on how to proceed against the opponent without stopping in guard with sword alone. Each technique consists of a theory section followed by the depiction of a body-posture to be used in the technique, and ending with illustrations of the most likely actions. Part 2: Sword and Dagger *Four techniques on how to proceed against the opponent without stopping in guard with the sword and dagger. Here, Fabris follows the same template as for the sword alone above. The section ends in the depiction of an opponent receiving a simultaneous thrust from his adversary's sword and dagger. Grapples, Disarms and Cape Throws Fabris adds a section on these techniques. Part 3: How To Use a Dagger and How to Defeat a Dagger-Wielding Assailant while Bare-Handed Fabris states that he had included this brief compendium only at the request of some friends. Here, he gives some advice on how to adapt his fencing theory to the use of a single dagger, and he then shows several ways in which to disarm a dagger-wielding assailant while bare-handed. The section ends on the depiction of a swordsman against a half-pikeman, and with the assurance that \\"if you have understood the theory, you will figure out how to proceed even against the man armed with the polearm.\\"  What other 17th century fencing masters said of Fabris  Throughout the 17th century, other masters such as Francesco Alfieri (1640), Giuseppe Morsicato Pallavicini (1670) and Francesco Antonio Marcelli (1686) commented on Fabris being a \\"great master\\" and \\"a man of the greatest name in our profession\\" and the author who best described the use of the guards. In his celebrated 1622 L'Academie De L'Espee, The Flemish master Girard Thibault added a chapter commenting on the excellence of Fabris' students, praising the quickness of their feints and suggesting ways to defeat them. But it is the German author Hynitzsch who in 1676 gives us the fullest idea of the fame that Fabris had achieved in Europe: his book was plagiarized by other fencing masters (Hynitczch accuses the Venetian Nicoletto Giganti in particular), while his style was adopted by several official fencing institutions such as the University of Jena.J. J. Hynitzsch, Scienza e Prattica d'Arme [...] Herrn Salvator Fabris, Leipzig, 1676.  Anecdotes on Fabris  The legendary stature achieved by Fabris in his lifetime accounts for the many anecdotes about him still circulating today. According to Italian fencing master and historian Luigi Barbasetti, Fabris was summoned to England to help Shakespeare choreograph the sword actions in the premier of Hamlet. There is also an interesting, yet uncorroborated story about a Salvator Fabritz (sic) coming to Sweden in 1594 as an assassin hired by king Sigismund III Vasa, according to the Exegesis historica, written by Duke Charles and his Chancellor Nicolaus Chesnecopherus and printed in Stockholm in 1610 based on a Swedish version published in 1609. According to this account, Sigismund intended to assassinate his uncle Charles, during a banquet at Uppsala on February 12, following the royal funeral of John III on 1 February. After the meal a number of costumed Italians, including an actor and playwright by the name of Salvator Fabritz, took part in a stage-performance with drawn swords. Fabritz was supposed to kill Charles during the performance, but Charles had been warned by a certain Hieronymus Strozzi and stayed away from the banquet. However, given that Fabris is a very common Italian surname (akin to Smith in English), it seems highly unlikely that these are both the same person. Also, there is no record of the Master ever being in Sweden. In 1676, Hynitzsch states that Nicoletto Giganti plagiarized Fabris' Book II in a German and French parallel edition in 1624. The German translator of Fabris is so incensed that he likens Giganti's offence to \\"the kidnapping of a child\\", and wishes for the immediate recall of the work. Today, Fabris' style is one of the most studied in the revival of historical European martial arts. This master's name and last name are found (historically) in different spellings such as Salvator, Salvatore, Salvador and Fabris, Fabbri plus other non- Italian spellings.

Football career The 177 cm wingman is noted for his speed and long left foot kicking. Black was recruited with the 12th selection in the 1996 AFL Draft and began his career with Fremantle in 1997. When not selected to play for Fremantle in the AFL he played for South Fremantle in the West Australian Football League (WAFL) and was a member of their 1997 WAFL Premiership winning side. After spending five seasons at the Dockers, and after finishing second in the Doig Medal (best and fairest) in 2001, he was traded to St Kilda during the 2001 AFL trade period, in return for pick # 17. This draft pick was then used to recruit Jeff Farmer from Melbourne. He was a vital part of the Saints' midfield during his relatively brief time there, and at the end of 2003 requested to be released so he could go back to Perth. However, the Saints lodged the trade request after the deadline and Black stayed on with St Kilda for another season. At the end of 2004 he was eventually traded back to the club which he began his career at. In 2005, Black was one of the few consistent players in a mediocre season for Fremantle. He finished fourth behind Peter Bell, Shane Parker and Matthew Pavlich, in the count for the club's best and fairest award, the Doig Medal. He was also represented Australian in the 2005 International Rules series against Ireland. On 6 August 2008, Heath Black announced his retirement from the AFL due to a combination of hip and should injuries. Controversies In February 2006, it was rumoured that Black would take part in a publicity stunt similar to the Garry Hocking \\"Whiskas\\" incident in 1998, in that Black would change his name to Heath Purple. Whilst Hocking's name change only lasted for a week, Black's would have lasted for the entire 2006 AFL season as part of a promotion with Ribena. However, Black was involved in a fight at the Perth Cup on New Year Day 2006 and subsequently charged with assault occasioning bodily harm, obstructing police and assaulting a female police officer The name change promotion did not eventuate. In June 2006 Black pleaded guilty to all charges and was fined $5000. Between 2007 and 2009 Black was charged in numerous alcohol related driving and violence offences. He revealed in October 2009 that he suffered from anxiety and depression. In 2012 he released his autobiography titled Black, co-written with Lisa Holland-McNair, where he revealed that he had been diagnosed with bipolar II and adult ADHD. He has started to work with the AFL Players Association to educate young people about mental health.

Ridolfo Capo Ferro da Cagli (Ridolfo Capoferro, Rodulphus Capoferrus) was an Italian fencing master in the city of Siena, best known for his rapier fencing treatise published in 1610. He seems to have been born in the town of Cagli in the Province of Pesaro e Urbino, but was active as a fencing master in Siena, Tuscany. Little else is known about his life, though the dedication to Federico Ubaldo della Roevere, the young son of Duke Francesco Maria II della Roevere, may indicate that he was associated with the court at Urbino in some capacity. The statement at the beginning of Capo Ferro's treatise describing him as a \\"master of the great German nation\\"Capo Ferro da Cagli, Ridolfo. Gran Simulacro dell'Arte e dell'Uso della Scherma. Siena, 1610. p 1. likely signifies that he was faculty at the University of Siena, either holding a position analogous to dean of all German students, or perhaps merely the fencing master who taught the German students.  Art and Use of Fencing  Capoferro's treatise Gran Simulacro dell'Arte e dell'Uso della Scherma (\\"Great Representation of the Art and Use of Fencing\\") was printed by Salvestro Marchetti and Camillo Turi in Siena, with illustrations by Rafael Schiamirossi, and is divided into two parts: Art and Practice. In the first part, he gives the general principles of swordsmanship and fencing, with the second part of his book covering actual techniques, described in text with accompanying illustrations. His work is interesting in that some methods that he denigrates in his theory he uses in his actions; most notably, he dismisses feints as dangerous or useless (depending upon the situation) and then uses them liberally in various actions in the second part of his book. The sword that Capo Ferro recommends should be \\"twice as long as the arm, and as much as my extraordinary pace (ie the lunge), which length corresponds equally to that which is from my armpit down to the sole of my foot.\\" For a 6' tall man this would equate to a 4 1/2' long sword. The book covers the use of single rapier, including basic sword grappling, as well as rapier and dagger, rapier and cloak, and rapier and rotella, a most unusual combination for the period, though far more common in the tradition of swordsmanship of the 16th century which preceded it. The rotella is a medium size concave round shield of approximately 60 cm in diameter with two straps to hold it. Similar metal shields survive, particularly from Spain in this period, though very few from Italy, implying that these shields were made of a perishable material such as wood or leather or a composite of such materials. The manual also includes techniques for fighting against a left-handed opponent. While many modern reference books state that rapiers were either blunt on their edges, or only had sharp edges in order to discourage blade grabs because they were not suitable for the cut, nearly 30% of the techniques included in Capoferro's treatise use the cut as a primary or secondary option. Capoferro's book was reprinted in Siena in 1629 by Ercole Gori, who had the plain backgrounds in twenty-seven of Schiamirossi's original illustrations replaced with intricate depictions of scenes from the Bible and Greek mythology; this version was reprinted in Bologna in 1652 by G. Longo. A third Siena printing was made in 1632 by Bernardino Capitelli, who omitted all of the introductory material and truncated the descriptions of the plays; he also commissioned new illustrations based on those of the first edition but scaled down to half size.  Spelling of name  The title page of Capoferro's book spells his surname as two words in Italian, Capo Ferro, and one word in Latin, Capoferrus. However, the spellings of such things were not standardized in this time, and various spellings can be seen in other sources. \\"Prima [e secundi] parte dell'Historia siciliana (1606)\\" clearly show the name spelt as two words, whereas Giuseppe Morsicato-Pallavicini's 1670 fencing treatise offers it as Capoferro; some works, such as \\"Bibliotheca Stoschiana sive Catalogus selectissimorum librorum quos Collegerat Philippvs Liber Baro De Stosch\\" (1759), even have the name hyphenated (Capo-Ferro). More recent writers, such as Jacopo Gelli's fencing bibliography, Sydney Anglo's book The Martial Arts of Renaissance Europe, and the listing of his books in many library catalogs, use the modern Italian spelling of the name, Capoferro.  Influence  Ridolfo's book must have been reasonably popular, as it was reprinted several times, but not many of the fencing treatises written in the next generation mention him and those that do are not necessarily complimentary. However, an extensive German rapier manual published in 1615 by Sebastian Heussler clearly draws many concepts from Capoferro and Salvator Fabris, combining their teachings into one system. Heussler even uses one of Capoferro's illustrations (figure 9) unmodified. Though not very influential in his own time, Capo Ferro was strongly praised by more recent authors such as Egerton Castle, who says in his 'Schools and Masters of Fence (1893)', \\"...but of all the Italian works on fencing none ever had such a share in fixing the principals of the science as 'Great Simulacrum of the Use of the Sword', by Ridolfo Capoferro\\", later adding \\"for once the title of the book fully represented its contents.\\"  In popular culture  In the fictional work The Princess Bride by William Goldman, Inigo Montoya and The Man in Black duel atop the Cliffs of Insanity where they mention various fencing techniques they have studied, including those of Capoferro.

Frankfurt, 1622, 1644. Johann Joachim Hynitzsch accuses Giganti of plagiarising Salvator Fabris in the second volume of the 1622 French and German translation of Giganti's treatise, printed in Frankfurt.Fabris, Salvator. Scienza E Pratica D'Arme Di Salvatore Fabris, Capo Dell' Ordine Dei Sette Cuori. Das ist: Herrn Salvatore Fabris Obristen des Ritter-Ordens der Sieben Hertzen, Italiänsche Fecht Kunst. Wie solche in zweyen Büchern ordentlich und deutlich verfasset, und mit Figuren dargestellet worden. Leipzig, 1676. fol.3r-3v. This is probably unfounded, as there is no evidence that Giganti had any involvement in any of the later printings of his 1606 work. Likewise Giganti does not appear involved in the 1628 Italian edition of his own 1606 treatise, which merely reprints Giganti’s original 1606 dedication, to the by then deceased Cosimo I de' Medici, with a separate printers dedication that makes no reference to Giganti’s continuing involvement. Likewise the disputed 1622 edition contained no dedication and was likely printed by the publisher and translator, De Zetter, without consent. On several occasions in his 1606 treatise Giganti promised a second book. This pledge appeared to have remained unfulfilled. As early as 1673 the Sicilian master Pallavicini noted with heavy irony that while he was publishing a second volume, without having undertaken to do so in his first book, other masters such as Giganti had promised a second work and not delivered. … we should not make promises [we can't keep] to the curious. … Nicoletto Giganti promised to publish a second book, but it cannot be foundPallavicini, Giuseppe Morsicato. La seconda parte della scherma illustrata (Palermo, 1673) p.v. The first positive reference to a purported second book by Giganti, does not arrive until the 1847 publication of Alberto Marchionni’s Trattato di scherma: In 1608, from the press of Giovanni Fontani of Pisa, came forth a second book of fencing by Niccoletto Giganti in which he deals with the use of the single sword, sword and dagger and also the sword and rotella, the sword and targe, the sword and buckler, the sword and cape, the dagger alone, the dagger against the spear and the dagger alone against the sword. Subsequently he discusses grabs to the weapon and pommel strikes to the face, and of other grapples advising to put your left hand over the hilt of your opponent's sword. He proposes executing the passata sotto in the tempo in which your opponent performs a cavazione on the line of terza. Finally he discusses a new guard with the sword and dagger with the left foot forward, suggesting that he proposes to publish another book where he will teach all of the actions possible with the left foot forward. This treatise is illustrated with 53 figures, very badly drawn and likewise engraved; nevertheless his treatise is filled with very useful teachings.Marchionni, Alberto. Trattato di scherma: sopra un nuovo sistema di giuoco misto di scuola italiana e francese. Florence, 1847. p.41-42. This work is further cited by Gelli, who merely quotes word for word from Marchionni, adding only the note 'rare work', indicating that he almost certainly had not examined the treatise himself.Gelli, Jacopo. Bibliografia generale della scherma. Florence, 1890. pp.112-113. The existence of this elusive second work, matching Marchionni's description, was not confirmed until the publication of an English translation by Piermarco Terminiello and Joshua Pendragon in November 2013.Terminiello, Piermarco and Pendragon, Joshua.

Hackett recorded the album during a break in group activity in mid-1975 and used guest musicians, including Genesis bassist Mike Rutherford and drummer Phil Collins, to play on the record. It has a loose concept with the title and lyrics of each track inspired by a Tarot card. Voyage of the Acolyte reached No. 26 in the UK and No. 191 in the US. It was reissued in 2005 with bonus tracks. A surround upmix of the album is included in Premonitions: The Charisma Recordings 1975–1983 (2015). Background and writing By 1975, Hackett had been the guitarist in the progressive rock band Genesis for four years. He began to write sections of different songs while recording albums with Genesis, specifically at moments when his \\"services weren't really called upon, and I found I had a lot of spare time\\". By this time, Hackett had become increasingly frustrated from the band's packed touring schedule which had affected his creativity, and had a growing desire to work with a new set of musicians. He had written pieces without any specific project in mind, including those for instruments other than the guitar and another for a female vocalist, but after a while of this he had assembled enough ideas to form an album. Development was put on hold in late 1974 due to Genesis touring commitments with their album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974), but Hackett remained productive and continued to write in his hotel room each night which kept him \\"sane\\" and help calm his stage nerves. When it came to a direction of the album, Hackett thought of a loose concept from his newfound interest in Tarot cards, which he used to title the album's tracks, and their lyrics, based on various cards in a deck. He took the cards that had conjured the strongest feeling and \\"mapped out a way of working\\", such as having \\"Star of Sirius\\" a \\"poppy\\" track to reflect the optimism that the corresponding Tarot card depicts. A track left off the album was one named \\"The Fool\\", which had Hackett play in a style similar to that of Pete Townshend to a song that was like \\"ELO meets The Who\\", but he chose not to use it. Some of Hackett's material originated from his pre-Genesis days. Hackett had convinced Genesis to rehearse \\"Shadow of the Hierophant\\" as a potential song for Foxtrot, but it fell through. It also marked a first collaboration with his brother John on an album, which has continued through Steve Hackett's solo career. The album also signified Hackett's first attempts at playing keyboards, and aimed for an album that had a more layered sound. The album's original title was Premonitions, but management at Charisma disliked it and suggested Voyage of the Acolyte, to which Hackett agreed. Recording Hackett recorded Voyage of the Acolyte in June and July 1975, starting one month after Genesis had finished touring their double concept album, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. Recording was completed in four weeks at Kingsway Recorders, then located in Kingsway, central London. The album's cover is a Chinese watercolour painting by Brazilian artist Kim Poor, whom Hackett later married and produced many of his future album covers. Hackett dedicated Voyage of the Acolyte to Poor. Track listing All songs written by Steve Hackett, except where indicated. Personnel Credits are adapted from the album's original liner notes.

Modern loading bay with overhead door, dock leveller and dock shelter. A loading dock or loading bay is an area of a building where goods vehicles (usually road or rail) are loaded and unloaded. They are commonly found on commercial and industrial buildings, and warehouses in particular. Loading docks are part of a facility's service or utility infrastructure, typically providing direct access to staging areas, storage rooms, and freight elevators. Basics In order to facilitate material handling, loading docks may be equipped with the following: * Bumpers – protect the dock from truck damage, may also be used as a guide by the truck driver when backing up. * Dock leveler – a height-adjustable platform used as a bridge between dock and truck, can be operated via mechanical (spring), hydraulic, or air powered systems. * Dock seals or dock shelters – compressible foam blocks against which the truck presses when parked; seals are used at exterior truck bays in colder climates where this will provide protection from the weather. * Dock light – a movable articulating light mounted inside the dock used to provide lighting inside the truck during loading operations. In North America, the most common dock height is . A dock leveler bridges the gap between a truck and a warehouse to safely accommodate a forklift. Loading zone In different parts of the world, a section of a public or private road may be allocated for loading goods or persons, at specific or at all times. There are parking signs and/or road markings to warn motorists of parking regulations. These areas are known as loading zones or loading bays in many jurisdictions. They are generally monitored by parking inspectors, and vehicles found to be violating the rules can be towed or fined.

Taxonomically, it is most closely related to its counterpart in the northern regions of Africa, the waldrapp (Geronticus eremita). As a species, it has a very restricted homerange, limited to the southern tips of South Africa in highland and mountainous regions. This large, glossy, blue-black ibis has an unfeathered red face and head, and a long, decurved red bill. It breeds colonially on and amongst rocks and on cliffs, laying two or three eggs which are incubated for 21 days before hatching. It is a large bird that feeds and roosts in substantial groups. It feeds on insects, small reptiles, rodents and small birds. They do little vocalizing other than occasional gobbling sounds. The ibises are gregarious long-legged wading birds with long down-curved bills; they form one subfamily of the Threskiornithidae, the other subfamily being the spoonbills. The two Geronticus species differ from other ibises in that they have unfeathered faces and heads, breed on cliffs rather than in trees, and prefer arid habitats to the wetlands used by their relatives. The species is currently listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, however, it is in no immediate danger of extinction.  Taxonomy  The southern bald ibis was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1781 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux based a specimen obtained from the Cape of Good Hope region of South Africa. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enluminées D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Tantalus calvus in his catalogue of the Planches Enluminées. The southern bald ibis is now placed in the genus Geronticus that was erected by the German naturalist Johann Georg Wagler in 1832. No subspecies are recognised. The southern bald ibis is part of the family, Threskiornithidae, which is composed of birds from the warm temperate and tropical regions of the world, with the exclusion of Oceania. The group is defined by the lack of feathers on their face. This family is composed of the ibises and their close relatives, the spoonbills. Taxonomically, ibises are categorized as a subfamily named Threskiornithinae. This subfamily contains around 26 species of wading birds with long, thin, down-curved beaks, ranging in size from medium to large. These species rarely have a voice box, and if one is present, the bird only croaks or cackles harshly. Historically, ibises are an ancient group. Fossil records of these birds have been dated back to the Eocene period, 60 million years ago. Human history records also date these birds back 5 000 years. The southern bald ibis is part of the genus Geronticus, which includes two distinct species. The southern bald ibis (Geronticus calvus) is restricted primarily to the southern regions of Africa whereas its counterpart, the waldrapp (Geronticus eremita) is found in the northern regions of the continent. Both species share common characteristics regardless of their geographic separation. Both species nest on rock cliffs and display distinct breeding behaviours adapted for their particular locations. Similarly, they both show evolutionary adaptations in foraging behaviours due to their dry habitats. The separation between these two species is believed to have occurred relatively recently. This separation, between G. calvus and G. eremita, is believed to have occurred only 335 000 to 1 million years ago.  Description  The southern bald ibis (Geronticus calvus) is an uncommon bird endemic to the highlands of the southern African region. In South Africa, the species’ total breeding population is estimated around 4 600 birds. However, little is known about the biology of this species. Its plumage is dark green with iridescent streaks of green, violet and bronze. The neck displays long feathers that are a blue-green shade. As adults, its shoulders display shades of copper. However, as juveniles, the plumage is predominantly a dull grey color. The bird's Latin name, Geronticus calvus, is translated as “bald, old man”, referring to the bird's featherless, wrinkled head and face. The head is the key feature in recognizing this species due to the evident bare whitish skin. On the top of the head, there is a red dome-shaped crown. The bills of these birds are down-curved and red, along with their legs. Similarly, their eyes are also colored an orange-red shade.  Distribution and habitat  The southern bald ibis is a species with a very restricted homerange. It is estimated that there are only 4 600 breeding birds of this species in the South African region. The species is confined to the eastern regions of South Africa and are restricted to the highland and mountainous regions. Its range extends from the highlands of Lesotho extending into Swaziland. The birds may migrate short distances within their designated home ranges. These birds are cliff-nesters and breed in the open areas of mountain faces, as well as river gorges and sometimes around waterfalls. Their breeding habitat is composed mainly of mountainous grasslands that range in altitude from 1 200 to 2 000 meters above sea level. The grassland areas are labeled as ‘sour’ due to the low nutritional value of the foliage in late summer and early autumn due to the previous grazing of mammals.  Behaviour  The southern bald ibis is a bird that feeds and roosts in large groups. They travel in groups of up to 100 individuals to find suitable foraging areas. As insectivores, their diet is composed mainly of insects and other small invertebrates found in burnt grasslands. The species live on cliff edges where they build their nests and for the most part, breed in colonies. They do little vocalizing besides occasional gobbling sounds. = Vocalizations = The southern bald ibis is known to be a relatively quiet bird. This species in particular has been noted to make a weak gobbling sound. This is refers back to their old Afrikaans name of “Wilde-Kalkoen”, otherwise translated as “wild turkey”. This bird is most boisterous in the nesting areas and in flight. It projects a high-pitched keeaaw-klaup-klaup call, resembling that of a turkey's. = Diet = This species is insectivorous and feeds predominantly on insects and other small terrestrial invertebrates. It is a forager, alternating between feeding in harvested maize fields, overgrazed pastures and burnt grasslands. They walk along the land while pecking and probing the ground. The main component of its diet is the caterpillar of the maize stalk borer, Busseola fusca. This bird will also turn over feces and leaves to search for prey including caterpillars, grasshoppers, beetles, earthworms, snails and sometimes frogs, small dead mammals and birds. Throughout July and the first half of August, before laying their eggs, the birds are found foraging in maize fields. In the second half of August and early September, during the incubation period, the birds are seen alternating between the maize fields, grazed pastures and burnt grasslands. Finally, in the nestling phase of September and October, they forge in maize fields, but more frequently in ploughed fields. It is only on rare occasions that ibises are seen in tall grasses and almost never in marshy areas. These birds avoid the tall grasses due to the hindering of their mobility and the potential hiding of their prey. This area would require a slow-walk feeding technique, whereas this bird is known to use a fast-walk technique for their feeding. They also appear to avoid foraging in areas very close to their nesting sites. Their predominant feeding area, the burnt grasslands, are termed “sour” due to the low availability of nutrients. These areas are burned every 1 to 3 years to clear any excess of foliage. In winter and spring, the ibises feed in the burned areas where new growth is emerging and scavenge for any available insects. Their breeding season is linked with the burning period of these crops. Therefore, successful breeding and survival is partially dependent on the availability of these burned grasslands. = Reproduction = The southern bald ibis nests in cliffs and breeds on open ledges. Due to the mostly inaccessible nature of these areas, observations during breeding season are difficult to obtain. However, these birds are known to breed predominantly in colonies, while some pairs decide to nest away from the rest. The females lay their eggs anywhere from late July to mid-October. Following this, the young develop feathers for flight around mid-October and into the month of December. Their nests are made mostly of sticks and grass. On average, the collection of these materials begins around two weeks before the first egg is laid. Once the first egg is laid, incubation lasts from 26 to 32 days. The incubating birds change their position and rotate the egg more frequently around three days before the hatch day. Once hatched, the chicks spend the first 7 to 10 days feeding from their parent via regurgitation. After 35 days, the young leave the nest to wander around and after 40 to 50 days, the chicks are able to fly, but still spend most of their time on the ledges of the cliff or in their nest.  Conservation status  The southern bald ibis is currently listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. However, there is no immediate threat of the species going extinct. The bird is also listed in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), signifying that the trade of this species is substantially regulated. One of the greatest causes in the decline of this species is human disturbance at their breeding sites and the degradation of their habitat. Most of the breeding sites occur on privately owned land, whereas only a small minority of breeding pairs are located on nature reserves or state forest land, which are the only areas where they are guaranteed protection. Therefore, a large portion of the population is dependent on the efforts and contributions of private landowners. Furthermore, another threat is that the adult birds may be captured in order to collect the eggs and nestlings for food or medicine in some African tribal practices. The hunting of these birds has also been popular in farming populations to supplement their meat supplies. Local hunting continues to be a threat today.

His first appearance in the series was as a grade 8 student on Degrassi Junior High. Since his first appearance up to Degrassi High, he has been the main focus character and arguably the most popular among the viewers. On Degrassi: The Next Generation, he is a recurring character. Early life As a youth, the character's trademark attire was a fedora he always wore over his mullet (though in some early episodes, he wore a beret). His personality was that of a humorous, extroverted, immature slacker and self-styled ladies man. Joey had a penchant for trying to either charm or coerce his peers into getting or doing what he wanted. He was a nuisance to some, and was known to play pranks on younger students, but this was usually limited to tricking them into going into the janitor's closet and locking them in. However, the character was portrayed with an innocent and caring side to his nature, especially when his friends were in a crisis. His teacher, and later principal, Mr. Raditch was tough on Joey, but it was to get Joey to try harder on his schoolwork. It was later revealed that Joey has dyslexia, which accounts for his academic struggles. However, through hard work and the support of his family, teachers and fellow students, Joey overcomes this obstacle. Joey's best friend from the beginning of the series was Wheels. Both Joey and Wheels later became best friends with Snake during the second season, when the trio formed a garage band called \\"The Zit Remedy\\" for the school's talent show. The band was later renamed \\"The Zits\\" when they went to high school. Despite the skepticism of his bandmates, combined with the band having only one song (\\"Everybody Wants Something\\"), Joey dreamed of making a career of this hobby, including making copies of demo tapes and a music video. Gradually, Joey and Snake became each other's best friend, although both remained close friends with Wheels. Joey's attitude At the conclusion of season 2 of Degrassi Junior High, Mr. Raditch informs Joey that he has failed grade eight. This news crushes Joey's spirits, as it means that he cannot join the rest of his friends in high school. Over-crowding of the high school, however, causes Joey's former classmates to take their grade 9 classes (aside from laboratory sciences) at Degrassi Junior High, and Joey thus continues to associate with them. A silver lining to repeating the eighth grade is becoming a classmate of Caitlin Ryan, an intellectual student. Working together on a class presentation, the characters develop an on-and-off relationship with each other as the series progressed. Joey had indeed gone out to dinner to celebrate his nineteenth birthday, but with Caitlin. Their dinner is cut short when Caitlin tries to hint to an oblivious Joey that her parents are out of town and she hates to sleep alone in the house; even running her foot along his leg fails to make her point until she slips a condom into his hand. The couple make love for the first time, Caitlin believing Joey to have been a virgin as she was. Still awash in the afterglow the next day at a cottage retreat attended by their classmates, Caitlin accepts the offer of marriage that Joey had made on her graduation night. Their engagement lasts only minutes, however, until Caitlin overhears Snake reprimanding Joey about having spent the summer dating Caitlin while secretly copulating with Tessa. \\"Tessa Campanelli? You were fucking Tessa Campanelli?!\\" the shocked Caitlin asks him before throwing his ring and storming out of his life. Some months later, Caitlin is receptive to his apology at Simon and Alexa's wedding reception, and the pair share a dance as friends. That evening, Joey correctly predicts to Caitlin that she will be a famous journalist. Later life Exposition in \\"Mother and Child Reunion\\" and \\"When Doves Cry\\" reveals much about the intervening eleven years. Joey owns Jeremiah Motors, a used car dealership. Sometime presumably around 1994,Based upon Angie's age. three years after his break-up with Caitlin, he enters a relationship with Julia Manning, one of the only people known to address him as \\"Joe\\". Several years older than Joe, Julia has a son Craig with her abusive husband Albert. It is not revealed whether Julia was divorced or even separated from Albert by the time she and Joe began dating, although Albert refers to Julia as having left him for Joey. Among the attendees at the Jeremiahs' wedding are best man Snake Simpson, classmate Christine \\"Spike\\" Nelson, Spike's daughter Emma and Julia's son Craig. Their marriage produces a daughter, Angela, before Julia dies in 1999. Devastated by the loss of his wife, Joey closes himself off from the rest of the world – including his friends – for the next year. On the day before their combined nine- and ten- year high school reunion, Joey attempts to sell a car to his old friend, Lucy Fernandez who asks if he is coming and hints that his wife would not have wanted him to become a recluse. Joey agrees to take Lucy out for a test drive, and drops her off at Degrassi Community School. There, Joey spots Caitlin, and they contemplate how they've changed. He decides to go with them for drinks later, but still remains unconfirmed for the reunion. At the bar, his friends reminisce about old times when his television advertisement for his car dealership airs. The advertisement showed Joey ripping his shirt off, resulting in a blunt critique from Caitlin's new fiancé, Keith. A movie director, Keith initiates friction between himself and Joey by admonishing the latter to \\"avoid the shifty, used-car-salesman vibe.\\" Caitlin responds that he was a total \\"ham\\" during high school, and still is. Joey commiserates with Caitlin the next night after she discovers Keith trying to seduce Allison Hunter and demeaning Caitlin. Toying with her discarded engagement ring from Keith, Caitlin asks Joey if it reminds him of that day eleven years earlier at the beach. Season two starts when Joey's stepson Craig Manning transfers to Degrassi. Reuniting with Angie's babysitter, Emma Nelson, with whom he had danced at Joey and Julia's wedding, Craig convinces her to let him spend time with his half-sister Angie (all in violation of Craig's instructions from Albert who wants Craig to have nothing to do with Joey or Angie). Angela sees Craig's bruises from being beaten by his father Albert, and reveals it to Joey. After an emotional moment in front of Julia's grave, where Craig admits to having been abused by Albert, Joey welcomes him into his home and helps him to file a police complaint. He later helps Craig come to terms with Albert's drunk driving death, and being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Joey last appeared in season five's \\"Our Lips Are Sealed (1).\\" In that episode, Joey is dating Diane whom he had met at Ashley's father's wedding. In a reversal of his marriage to Julia, Joey is several years older than Diane. Mastroianni's departure In January 2007, three days after the Degrassi episode \\"What it Feels Like to be a Ghost, Part Two\\" aired, Pat Mastroianni announced on his website that he will no longer play the part of Joey Jeremiah. Reception In 1990, Pat Mastroianni was nominated for a Young Artist Award for Outstanding Young Ensemble Cast for his role as Joey Jeremiah, alongside his co-stars. In 1987, 1988, and 1990, Mastroianni was nominated for Best Performance by a Lead Actor in a Continuing Dramatic Role at the Gemini Awards, winning it in 1988.

So-called because kettledrums were associated with trumpets and borrowed the terms for their rhythms from those for tonguing.Encyclopædia Britannica, 11th ed., Vol. 15, p. 764. Tonguing is a technique used with wind instruments to enunciate different notes using the tongue on the reed or woodwind mouthpiece or brass mouthpiece. A silent \\"tee\\"Arban's Complete Conservatory Method for Trumpet The Authentic Edition, p.7 is made when the tongue strikes the reed or roof of the mouth causing a slight breach in the air flow through the instrument. If a more soft tone is desired, the syllable \\"da\\" (as in double) is preferred. The technique also works for whistling. Tonguing also refers to articulation, which is how a musician begins the note (punchy, legato, or a breath attack) and how the note is released (air release, tongued release, etc.) For wind players, articulation is commonly spoken of in terms of tonguing because the tongue is used to stop and allow air to flow in the mouth. Tonguing does not apply to non wind instruments, but articulation does apply to all instruments. An alteration called \\"double-tonguing\\" or \\"double-articulation\\" is used when the music being performed has many rapid notes in succession too fast for regular articulation. In this case, the tongue makes a silent \\"tee-kee\\".Arban's Complete Conservatory Method for Trumpet The Authentic Edition, p.153 (The actual tongue positioning varies slightly by instrument. Clarinetists may go \\"too-koo\\" but a bassoonist may actually say \\"taco\\".) Double-articulation allows the tongue to stop the airflow twice as fast when mastered. If the music specifies a pizzicato sequence, the musician might perform this as a rapid sequence of the articulated note, thus: \\"tee-kee-tee-kee-tee-kee-...\\" etc., in staccato. When beginning with \\"da\\", the second syllable is \\"ga\\". Double tonguing is easiest on brass instruments, and it is more difficult for some woodwind instruments, primarily the clarinet and saxophone. There is also \\"triple-tonguing\\", used in passages of triplets: \\"tee-tee-kee-tee-tee-kee\\", or less commonly \\"tee-kee-tee-tee-kee-tee\\". Cross-beat tonguing, used for dotted rhythms (Notes inégales: louré or pointé): tu-ru, with ru falling on the longer note on the beat. Another method was made by Earl D. Irons, this method was a tee-kee-tee kee-tee-kee. This triple tonguing method is most likely the fastest if done correctly. The reason for this is that the tee and kee never repeat itself. Earl D. Irons is the author of 27 Groups Of Exercises, a book full of lip-slurs, double tonguing, and triple tonguing. Brown, Rachel (2003). The early flute: a practical guide, p.23. . Such as: : - (=) : tu-ru There are different ways of tonguing for the flute. Some flutists tongue between the teeth; others do it between the lips as if spitting; others do it behind the teeth in the roof of the mouth as with trill consonants. With this roof articulation the flutist thinks of the words dah-dah and for double tonguing it is dah-gah-dah-gah. Tonguing is indicated in the score by the use of accent marks. The absence of slurs is usually understood to imply that each note should be tongued separately. When a group of notes is slurred together, the player is expected to tongue the first note of the group and not tongue any of the other notes, unless those notes have accent marks. Trombone players must lightly tongue many slurs by tonguing \\"da\\"; otherwise, the result would be a glissando. The bagpipes require finger articulations (\\"graces\\"), since direct tonguing is impossible.Kite-Powell, Jeffery (2007). A Performer's Guide to Renaissance Music, p.98. Indiana University. .

It started around noon when more than 400 construction workers, and soon hundreds more, attacked more than 1,000 demonstrators affiliated with the Student strike of 1970 who were protesting the Vietnam War and other issues following the April 30 announcement by President Richard Nixon of the U.S. invasion of neutral Cambodia, and the May 4 Kent State shootings. The riot, first breaking out near the intersection of Wall Street and Broad Street in Lower Manhattan, led to a mob scene with more than 20,000 people in the streets, eventually leading to a siege of New York City Hall, and lasted more than three hours. More than 100 people, including seven policemen, were injured on what became known as \\"Bloody Friday\\". Six people were arrested, but only one of them was a construction worker associated with the rioters.Profile of incident, chnm.gmu.edu; accessed April 23, 2016., The Daily Beast excerpt of The Hardhat Riot; accessed September 11, 2020., The Washington Post book review of The Hardhat Riot; accessed September 11, 2020. Background On May 4, 1970, thirteen students were shot, four of them fatally, at Kent State University in Ohio by National Guardsmen as they demonstrated against the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and U.S. incursions into Cambodia. One of the dead was Jeffrey Glenn Miller, who was from a New York City suburb on Long Island, which led to funeral proceedings in Manhattan and Long Island, which helped fuel local activism. In the days before the riot, there were anti-war protests on Wall Street and smaller clashes between construction workers and anti-war demonstrators. As a show of sympathy for the dead students, Republican Mayor of New York City John Lindsay ordered all flags at New York City Hall to be flown at half-staff on May 8, the day of the riot.Kifner, \\"4 Kent State Students Killed by Troops\\", New York Times, May 5, 1970. The U.S. labor movement was deeply divided over support for President Richard Nixon's Vietnam War policy. AFL-CIO president George Meany and most labor leaders in the United States were vehemently anti-communist and thus strongly supported U.S. military involvement in Southeast Asia. One strong supporter of the President’s policy of Vietnamization, but he also said he wanted the war ended, was Peter J. Brennan, president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of Greater New York, an alliance of building and construction unions in the New York City area. He was also president of the Building and Construction Trades Council of New York, the statewide umbrella group for construction unions. Additionally, he served as the vice president of the New York City Central Labor Council and the New York State AFL-CIO, umbrella groups for all labor unions in these respective areas.McFadden, \\"Peter Brennan, 78, Union Head and Nixon's Labor Chief\\", nytimes.com, October 4, 1996.Fink, Biographical Dictionary of American Labor, 1984. Brennan was a registered Democrat who had lobbied strongly for Democrats through the 1950s and 1960s, but increasingly supported Republican candidates as support for skilled labor unions decreased. The building and construction unions were overwhelmingly white, Catholic, blue-collar and male. Despite myths, however, that large majorities of these Americans supported Nixon's Vietnam policy, blue-collar whites were largely not more hawkish about the war than affluent whites, according to David Paul Kuhn in his book The Hardhat Riot, who also reported that “upscale whites were slightly more in favor of escalating the war in Cambodia, compared to downscale whites”—and like most Americans in 1970, blue-collar whites also saw the war as a “mistake”, but the “anti-war movement was less popular than the Vietnam War” among all Americans, and particularly blue-collar whites by 1970. Thus due to issues like flag desecration and that blue-collar whites were the majority of those who served in the war, blue-collar whites most commonly wanted to support the troops even though they came to dislike the war. By comparison, Kuhn reported that college educated whites were “6.5 times less likely to serve in Vietnam” than their share of the population, and the anti-war movement was also most associated with college students. The riot At 7:30 a.m. on May 8, several-hundred anti-war protesters, mostly college students, began picketing the New York Stock Exchange and later, holding a memorial at Federal Hall National Memorial for the four dead students at Kent State as well as a protest. By late morning, when some high school students joined, as well as some teachers and others, the protesters now numbered more than a thousand. They were gathered in the street in front of Federal Hall and on the steps around the statue of George Washington and Paul O'Dwyer was among the speakers., The Daily Beast excerpt of The Hardhat Riot; accessed September 11, 2020. The protesters demanded an end to the war in Vietnam and Cambodia, the release of political prisoners in the United States, such as Black Panther Party leaders Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, and an end to military-related research on all university campuses.Bigart, \\"War Foes Here Attacked By Construction Workers\\", New York Times, May 9, 1970.Freeman, \\"Hardhats: Construction Workers, Manliness, and the 1970 Pro-War Demonstrations\\", Journal of Social History, Summer 1993. Shortly before noon, more than 400 construction workers, many of whom were building the World Trade Center, converged on the student rally at Federal Hall from four directions. Some construction workers carried U.S. flags and chanted \\"USA, All the way\\", and \\"America, love it or leave it\\". Anti-war protestors shouted, “Peace now”. More than 800 office workers soon joined the construction workers’ ranks. Hundreds more construction workers arrived around noon, as the lunch-time crowd and onlookers in the streets exceeded 20,000., The Daily Beast excerpt of The Hardhat Riot; accessed September 11, 2020. A thin and inadequate line of police, who were largely sympathetic to the workers' position, formed to separate the construction workers from the anti-war protesters. One spark might have been a protestor, near the construction workers, who waved a Vietcong flag from the steps of Federal Hall., The Daily Beast excerpt of The Hardhat Riot; accessed September 11, 2020. At first, the construction workers only pushed but did not break through the police line. After several minutes, however, they broke through the police line and began chasing students through the streets. The workers attacked those who looked like hippies and beat them with their hard hats and other weapons, including tools and steel-toe boots. Victims and onlookers reported that the police stood by and did little. Hundreds of construction workers and counter-protesters moved up Broadway, making their way to City Hall Park toward City Hall. They pushed their way to the top to the top of the steps, sieging City Hall as some chanted \\"Hey, hey, whattya say? We support the USA\\", while some held American flags, then attempted to gain entrance because they demanded the flag above City Hall be raised to full staff. Police on duty at City Hall, and reinforcement, were able to stop the men from getting inside. A few workers were asked to enter the building to calm tensions. A postal worker who was already inside went to the roof of city hall and raised the U.S. flag there to full mast. When one mayoral aide lowered the flag back down to half-mast, hundreds of construction workers stormed the area around City Hall, leading to melee like on Wall Street the hour prior. Deputy Mayor Richard Aurelio, fearing the building would be overrun by the mob, ordered city workers to raise the flag back to full mast. Rioting construction workers also attacked buildings near city hall. Many were Catholic \\"white ethnics\\". Several workmen ripped the Red Cross flag down at nearby Trinity Church, because the flag was associated with the anti-war protestors, though it was planted to signal a first aid haven. Several groups of construction workers stormed the newly built main Pace University building, smashing lobby windows and beating up students, including with tools. More than 100 people were injured. The injured included seven policemen. Most of the injured required hospital treatment. The most common victim was a “22-year-old white male collegian” and the worst injuries were to the “half-dozen young men beaten unconscious”, but about one in four of the injured were women. Six people were arrested, but only one construction worker was arrested by police. Aftermath Peter J. Brennan, U.S. Secretary of Labor during the Nixon and Ford administrations. During a press conference that evening, President Nixon tried to defuse the situation before tens of thousands of students arrived in Washington, D.C. for a scheduled protest rally the next day. Before dawn, the next morning, Nixon told some protesters that \\"I understand just how you feel\\", and defended the recent U.S. troop movements into Cambodia as aiding their goal of peace.Foner, U.S. Labor and the Vietnam War, 1989.Frankel, \\"NIXON DEFENDS CAMBODIA DRIVE AS AIDING STUDENTS' PEACE AIM; says pullout will begin soon, nytimes.com, May 9, 1970.

Brennan claimed telephone calls and letters to the unions were 20 to 1 in favor of the workers.Perlmutter, \\"Head of Building Trades Unions Here Says Response Favors Friday's Action; 20-1 Endorsement Cited In Phone Calls and Mail\\", nytimes.com, May 12, 1970.

See Bigart, \\"War Foes Here Attacked By Construction Workers\\", nytimes.com, May 9, 1970. The NYPD \\"buried most records of police malfeasance\\", according to Kuhn’s The Hardhat Riot, and in August 1970, the NYPD published a report that largely acquitted itself of any collusion with construction workers though its own records were decades later shown to undercut that report. The construction workers and police were both mostly \\"white ethnics\\", lived in the same neighborhoods, and socialized in similar establishments; many were also veterans of World War II and Korea and both were also disproportionately likely to have family and friends in Vietnam., The Wall Street Journal book review of The Hardhat Riot; accessed September 11, 2020. On Sunday, May 10, Nixon's Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman wrote in his diary, \\"The college demonstrators have overplayed their hands, evidence is the blue-collar group rising up against them, and [the] president can mobilize them\\".

The rallies culminated in a large rally on May 20 in which an estimated 150,000 construction workers, longshoremen, and others rallied outside city hall. When the workers later marched down Broadway, many office workers in surrounding buildings showed their support by showering the marchers with ticker tape. One magazine coined the day, \\"Workers' Woodstock\\". On May 26, Brennan led a delegation of 22 union leaders, who represented more than 300,000 tradesmen, to meet with President Nixon at the White House and presented him with several ceremonial hard hats, and a flag pin. Nixon said he sought to honor those “labor leaders and people from Middle America who still have character and guts and a bit of patriotism”. Nixon general counsel Charles Colson, who organized the meeting and was later in charge of developing a strategy to win union support for Nixon in the 1972 presidential election, identified Brennan as a friendly labor leader due to his role in organizing the counter-protests in the weeks after \\"Bloody Friday\\". Brennan later organized significant labor union political support for Nixon in the 1972 election. Nixon appointed Brennan as his labor secretary after the election as a reward for his support and he was retained by President Gerald Ford into 1975, following Nixon's resignation.Peter Brennan obituary, nytimes.com, October 4, 1996.Stetson, \\"Brennan Reports Labor Leaders Favoring Nixon Are Organizing\\", nytimes.com, September 9, 1972; Stetson, \\"200 Labor Chiefs in City Form Nixon Committee\\", nytimes.com, September 28, 1972; Naughton, \\"Construction Union Chief in New York Is Chosen to Succeed Hodgson\\", nytimes.com, November 30, 1972; Shabecoff, \\"Brennan Choice Called Political Move\\", nytimes.com, December 1, 1972. The book The Hardhat Riot wrote of the riot that it was the day when the Old Left attacked the New Left, because \\"two liberalisms collided that day, presaging the long Democratic civil war ahead\\", and that the riot and demonstrations after captured the \\"era when FDR’s everyman first turned against the liberalism that once had championed him\\" and Nixon \\"moved the Republican Party from blue bloods to blue collars\\". In their reviews of the The Hardhat Riot, the New York Daily News wrote that the riot \\"changed American politics, perhaps forever\\" and, in the New York Times, Clyde Haberman characterized the riot as \\"a blue-collar rampage whose effects still ripple, not the least of them being Donald Trump’s improbable ascension to the presidency\\"., The New York Daily News review of The Hardhat Riot; accessed September 11, 2020.

Gershwin used the spelling \\"Tschaikowsky\\" from the German transliteration (used by German music publishers of the period) in place of the more widely accepted modern transliteration Tchaikovsky. \\"Tschaikowsky (and Other Russians)\\" is not a song in the normal sense of the term: it is a rhyming list of fifty Russian composers' names, which Kaye rattled off (in a speaking, not singing, voice) as rapidly as possible. At each performance, Kaye tried to break his previous speed record for reciting this song: consequently, it was intended to be recited a cappella (without instrumental accompaniment), as the orchestra could not keep up with him. The performance launched Kaye's career. NY Times: Danny Kaye obituary One of the names in the song is \\"Dukelsky\\"; this is actually the birth name of Vernon Duke, an American composer. Similarly, Stanisław Moniuszko, Witold Maliszewski and Leopold Godowsky are ethnic Poles. All four of these men were, however, born within the Russian empire. The song was originally a nonsense poem which Ira Gershwin had published in a college newspaper under the name \\"Arthur Francis\\" (derived from the names of his other brother Arthur and his sister Frances) in his student days. Decades later, in his memoir Lyrics on Several Occasions, Ira Gershwin expressed the hope that someone might accuse him of plagiarizing his song \\"Tschaikowsky\\" from the collegiate poem, so he could reveal that he and Arthur Francis were the same person.

It was the first school in Australia to offer the International Baccalaureate (IB), starting the programme in February 1978. Despite attempts to close the college in the late 1970s due to falling enrolments, the school now has a full enrolment and an extensive waiting list. It has earned a reputation for academic excellence in the ACT, attracting 63% of its students from out of area including New South Wales. History Narrabundah College was formed as a result of the ACT developing its own education system in 1974. The new system meant that public high schools would only teach from year 7 to 10, and that years 11 and 12 would be completed at a separate school. The pre-existing Narrabundah High School was re-formed as Narrabundah College. Due to low enrolments, the ACT Schools' Authority threatened to close the school in 1978. This prompted the community into seeking backing for the IB programme. The then-federal Minister for Education, John Carrick, approved the commencement of the programme in 1979, ensuring the survival of the school. It has prospered in the years since. Campus Map of Narrabundah College before the demolition of blocks D, B, and C in 2018. The college campus is located in the suburb of Narrabundah, Canberra. It consists of several buildings including the large \\"S Block\\" which was originally the segregated senior building for years 11 and 12 prior to the school becoming a secondary college. In addition to a quadrangle and a canteen, the college also has a gymnasium and a theatre, as well as spacious playing fields on which students may spend their free time and is close to golf courses, public ovals and the local shops. The College facilities also feature smart boards, iPads, and computer and science labs. Every student is supplied a laptop computer for personal and educational use according to ACT legislation. Block B, Block C, and Block D were contaminated with friable crocidolite asbestos. As such, the ACT Government employed Robson Environmental to undertake regular inspections to ensure the safety of staff and students. Furthermore, the affected buildings were demolished after the 2018 school year, and are to be replaced with modern educational facilities. Transportable classrooms were installed in the college during session 2 of 2018.  Curriculum  Narrabundah College offers a wide range of courses, and is highly regarded in the field of languages. As well as ESL and TIS (Translating and Interpreting Skills), the college offers students the opportunity to study the following languages: * Chinese * French * German * Hindi * Indonesian * Italian * Japanese * Korean * Spanish Hindi was taken off of the curriculum during the 2018 school year, but was reintroduced by the 2019 enrolment period. Indonesian was scheduled to be removed from the curriculum in 2019 due to low interest; however, due to a student-organised petition for the school to continue teaching the language, the college has continued to offer Indonesian as a class.  Student assessments  For students to be awarded a Year 12 Certificate on the completion of Year 12, they must complete a total of 17 units from College courses including either 3 majors and 3 minors, 4 majors and 1 minor, or 5 majors. Courses offered by the College are assessed based on how students perform during assignments, essays, tests, \\"lab-pracs\\", workshop projects, and creative works depending on what is appropriate for the course area. Each course offered by the College is designated tertiary (T), vocational (V), or accredited (A). Students completing A units are awarded an A to E grade based on performance for each course criteria, students completing V units are designated as 'competent' (C) or 'not yet competent' (NYC), and students completing T units will receive an A to E grade as well as a score to indicate a rank compared to other students in the same course. Students who fail to complete the minimum requirements for assessments will \\"void\\" the unit, and do not have that unit count towards the completion of their course.

A miniature park may contain a model of a single city or town, often called a miniature city or model village, or it can contain a number of different sets of models. History Bekonscot, in England, was one of the first model villages to become a tourist attraction There is evidence to suggest the existence of private model villages and miniature parks since the 19th century, but it was only in the 1930s to 1950s that the genre became tourist attractions. Early examples include Bekonscot in the UK and Madurodam in The Hague. Variations on a theme Most model villages and parks are built to a consistent scale; varying from 1:76 as used by the intricately detailed Pendon in England up to the 1:9 scale of Wimborne Model Town. There has been a move away from the model village concept since the mid- to late 20th century towards a miniature park concept. Model villages are typically larger-scale, sit in a cohesive miniature landscape and allow viewing and physical interaction with the exhibits, such as publicly accessed streets and urban areas.

Overview The band originally formed with the intention of playing only one set, so they wrote a full set of songs. They adopted the name 'Theset' for this reason. The band members originally included Kyle Dark (guitar), Jory MacKay (guitar), Dean Rode (bass guitar), and Tristan Tarr (drums). Dark asked Martin MacPhail (singer) to sing for the band's set, and he did. When Dark left the country, he was quickly replaced by Elliot Carter (guitar), who had previously played in local band \\"Lythic Blue\\" with MacPhail. Theset released their debut album, The Philosophy of Time Travel in 2005. It was produced by Adam Sutherland. They have toured western Canada since its release. The band released their second album, Neveroddoreven, in September 2008. They played 2 dates at the Calgary and Vancouver Warped Tour on the Kia Kevin Says Stage. In September 2010, the band released their 3rd record, Monsters. It was produced by Julius Butty and released by WAX Records.

(1993) Blackheath Village & Environs, 1790–1990, Vol.1 The Village and Blackheath Vale (Bookshop Blackheath, London), p.157. After moving to its present location in 1872, it operated as a boys' boarding school under the name of Cordwalles School until 1919. Up to this time, it was among a group of preparatory schools — which included Stubbington House School and Eastman's Royal Naval Academy — that maintained strong connections with the Royal Navy. In that year, 1919, the school was bought by Major Vernon Seymour Bryant who renamed it St Piran's. It reopened in 1920 with 23 boys, increasing to 65 the following year. After becoming an educational trust in 1972, the school became co-educational in 1993, and boarding ended the same year.

The coordinates of the municipal seat of Atolinga are 21° 44’ 15” north and 103° 28’ 30” west. The town is located at 2,250 meters above sea level and the municipality covers an area of 280 square kilometers. The municipality rests on a mesa that is the western border of the Tlaltenango Valley. The Atolinga River, which runs through the municipal seat is a tributary of the Bolaños River. A 2005 Census recorded 1,453 residents.  History  Prior to the arrival of the Spanish to the area, the region around Atolinga was inhabited by indigenous people of the Caxcan and Tepecan ethnic groups. The first Spanish contact with these people must have been in 1530 when Pedro Almíndez Chirino went through the Valley of Tlaltenango on a northbound expedition. The first land grantee of the area was Pedro Sernosa, who later sold his land to Juan Fernández de Jara Quemada. The town formed part of the jurisdiction of Tlaltenango for both ecclesiastical purposes and governmental purposes until the beginning of the 1800s. In 1814, a plea was made by the citizenry that the community be granted its own town council and status as a municipality due to the long distance from the municipal seat and the ascending local population. The plea spells out that the town counted with nearly 700 \\"souls\\" and that within a radius of two leagues lived more than 3,700 people. In recent decades, Atolinga's population has decreased due to emigration. Migrants from Atolinga can be found throughout the United States, especially in Chicago, Indianapolis, Atlanta, and the San Gabriel Valley region of California. Journalist Sam Quinones has written about such migrants in his book Antonio's Gun and Delfino's Dream: True Tales of Mexican Migration.

The building houses the chambers and offices of the Utah State Legislature, the offices of the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, the State Auditor and their staffs. The capitol is the main building of the Utah State Capitol Complex, which is located on Capitol Hill, overlooking downtown Salt Lake City. The Neoclassical revival, Corinthian style building was designed by architect Richard K.A. Kletting, and built between 1912 and 1916. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Beginning in 2004, the capitol underwent a major restoration and renovation project. The project added two new buildings to the complex while restoring many of the capital's public spaces to their original appearance. One of the largest projects during the renovation was the addition of a base isolation system which will allow the building to survive as much as a 7.3 magnitude earthquake. After completion of the renovations, the building was rededicated and resumed normal operation in January 2008. Early houses of government The Utah Territorial Statehouse The first Euro-American settlers arrived in what would become Utah on July 24, 1847, which is now commemorated as Pioneer Day in the state. These settlers, Mormon pioneers led by Brigham Young, appealed to the United States Congress for statehood in 1849, asking to become the State of Deseret. Their proposal was denied, but they received some recognition in September 1850 when the U.S. Government created the Territory of Utah as part of the compromise of 1850. A territorial assembly, known as the Utah Territorial Legislature, was created to be the governing body for the territory. The assembly met in various buildings including the Council House, which had originally been constructed to serve as capitol of the provisional State of Deseret, until the first capitol building was constructed. One of the first official acts of the assembly was to designate a capital city for the territory. On October 4, 1851, Millard County and its capital of Fillmore were created in the empty Pavant Valley for this purpose. The area was named for then current president Millard Fillmore. Its centralized location in the territory made it seem an ideal place for Utah's capital city. Construction started on Utah's first capitol building, known as the Utah Territorial Statehouse, the next year. The building was designed by LDS Church Architect Truman O. Angell, and was funded with $20,000 (equivalent to $ in ) appropriated by the United States Congress. The $20,000 was insufficient to pay for the capitol as designed, and so only the south wing was completed. In December 1855, the fifth Utah Territorial Legislature met in the building (it would be the first and only complete session in Fillmore). The next year the sixth Utah Territorial Legislature once again met in the statehouse, but the session was relocated to Salt Lake City after legislators complained about the lack of housing and adequate facilities in Fillmore. As a result, in December 1856 Salt Lake City was designated Utah's capital, and the statehouse in Fillmore was abandoned. Several buildings in Salt Lake City then served as temporary homes for the state legislature and offices for state officers, including the previously used Council House, and beginning in 1866, the Salt Lake City Council Hall. History of the Capitol =Early attempts for a capitol building= Capitol Hill looking west As time passed, those smaller buildings became inadequate, so several local leaders and businessmen began to call for a new permanent capitol building. Several of these people requested that Salt Lake City donate about of land, specifically an area known as Arsenal Hill, just north of the intersection of State and Second North Streets. The City Council of Salt Lake responded by approving a resolution on March 1, 1888, donating the property to the territorial government. A \\"Capitol Commission\\" was created to review the design and construction process for the new building. The commission selected Elijah E. Myers, who also designed the Michigan, Texas, and Colorado State Capitols, to design Utah's building. The plans were finished by 1891, but were ultimately rejected because of the $1 million (equivalent to $ in ) cost estimated. Plans for a capitol building were then delayed after the approval of an Enabling Act allowing Utahns to begin plans for statehood. On January 4, 1896 Utah was granted statehood, and the Salt Lake City and County Building was used as a capitol building for the new state. =The design and planning process= By 1909 no capitol had yet been constructed and Governor William Spry, recognizing that Utah was one of only a few states without a capitol building, sent a proposal to the state legislature asking for the creation of a new commission to oversee the construction of a capitol. During that year's legislative session the commission was created and efforts made to gain funding for construction. An appropriation bill, which would use a one mill property tax, was produced but failed in a required popular vote that June. Funding options in the form of bonds and loans were also researched. In 1910 the state constitution was amended to allow bonding for the capitol building, and by 1911 a bill authorizing $1,305,000 (equivalent to $ in ) in bonds was presented to the state legislature. The bill passed both houses after the amount was reduced to $1 million (equivalent to $ in )and was signed into law by the governor in Spring 1911. Funds were also boosted when Union Pacific Railroad president, Edward Henry Harriman, died in 1909, and his widow was required to pay a five- percent inheritance tax to the state of Utah. Union Pacific had helped to construct the Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in Utah, and Harriman had invested $3.5 million in Salt Lake City's electric trolley system. Because of these investments within the state, Mrs. Harriman paid the state treasurer $798,546 (equivalent to $ in ) on March 1, 1911, as required by law. After funding was secured, the commission began the design process for the building and grounds. The Olmsted Brothers of Massachusetts were chosen to provide the landscaping design and site plan. As options for the site on Capitol Hill were researched several members of various committees expressed concerns with the proposed site, due mainly to the cost of grading the steep hillside. In December 1911, a three-person committee was organized to consider other locations for a capitol building. One of the more popular sites considered was located on Fort Douglas property, near the present University of Utah, while others proposed locating the building in downtown Salt Lake City near the City and County Building. In the end, it was decided to construct on the original site known as Capitol Hill, and attempt to acquire surrounding property for the capitol campus. Aware of the demand for their properties, several owners charged the state exorbitant prices for the property needed to complete the site. Even as questions arose concerning the site location, and work progressed on site plans, the design of the building was begun. The commission decided to hold a design competition, a practice common for many public buildings of that era. A program for the competition was created with design requirements such as required square footage, the desired number of floors, and stipulation to keep the total cost under $2 million (equivalent to $ in ). The program was approved August 30, 1911, and information was sent to architectural firms. Those who were interested responded, and the commission selected 24 firms to compete. Because the compensation was less than expected, several contenders withdrew from the competition, and the commission further reduced the list to eight firms. The final designs for the building were due on January 12, 1912, less than five months after the finalists were selected. After designs were submitted the commission met several times to discuss their selections, and some architects were asked to make presentations. After two months the commission reduced the list of designs to just two, those submitted by Richard K.A. Kletting and Young & Sons, both of Salt Lake City. On March 13, 1912, the commission made its final vote and selected Richard Kletting's design by a vote of four to three. After his appointment as capitol architect, Kletting traveled to several capitals in the eastern United States, including the Kentucky State Capitol which influenced his final designs. His first working plans for the building were due July 15, 1912. =Construction= After Kletting produced more detailed plans, they were made available to contractors interested in bidding to work on the capitol. The submitted bids were opened December 3, 1912, at Salt Lake's Commercial Club with James Stewart & Company receiving the contract as general contractor on December 19, 1912. P. J. Morgan was awarded the contract for excavation and grading the site, and the capitol's groundbreaking ceremony took place December 26, 1912. A large amount of soil had to be excavated from the hillside, as the eastern side of the site was as high as the building's planned fourth story. The excavation was done using a steam shovel which dug into the hillside filling its large dipper, after which it turned around and emptied the dirt into a temporary Dinkey train. The small train then carried the soil to the nearby City Creek Canyon where it was dumped. After the building's base was graded and excavated, work on the foundation started. The capitol was to be built of stone, with a concrete and steel superstructure. By spring 1913 the foundation and basements walls were in place, and the steel columns and wooden frames for the concrete were being installed. Numerous small shops and offices had been constructed on the hill surrounding the site to support the building efforts, along with numerous small railroad lines carrying stone, mixed concrete, and other supplies. Contractors leased a right-of-way up Little Cottonwood Canyon, which originally held a railroad track from mines at Alta, and constructed a new railroad to carry granite from the canyon's quarry to the capitol site. On April 4, 1914, Governor William Spry presided over the cornerstone-laying ceremony. The cornerstone, dated 1914, was laid at the top of the southern steps, and was filled with records and photographs documenting the building's construction and Utah's culture. By the end of summer 1914 the basement, second floor, and exterior walls were nearing completion. The columns were being installed, and work progressed on the dome, including covering it in Utah copper. The capitol commission urged the work forward, hoping the eleventh session of the Legislature would be able to meet in the building the following year. But, as 1914 ended, work had not progressed enough and when the legislature met the next year, it did so in the Salt Lake City and County Building, until February 11, 1915, when the session was moved into the new capitol. Even though the legislature was meeting in the capital, it took more than a year to finish the remainder of the building sufficiently for the executive and judicial officers to occupy the building. After work was finished the capitol was publicly dedicated on October 9, 1916. The original construction cost was $2,739,538.00 (equivalent to $ in ) and replacement cost is estimated at $310,000,000 (equivalent to $ in ). The capitol was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. It is included in the Capitol Hill Historic District, a historic district also listed on the National Register. =Later alterations= Since its completion in 1916, the capital has had numerous alterations, all varying in scale. Renovation and restoration In summer 2004 the capitol closed for an extensive renovation, which included restoration work and a seismic upgrade. The renovation was guided by three main goals, first strengthen the structure to withstand as much as a 7.3 magnitude earthquake, then restore the original architectural and artistic details of the building, all while retaining functionality after the renovation. On August 7, 2004, the day before the capitol closed, a \\"Capitol Discovery Day\\" was held, and the public was invited to visit the capitol and learn about the changes being made, and why the project was necessary. By August 8, the day the capitol closed, the renovation had already begun in certain locations around Capitol Hill. In 2002, following the 2002 Winter Olympics, some buildings added to the capitol campus, such as the circular cafeteria building, were demolished, and construction started on two new buildings. These two buildings, constructed north of the capitol, would serve as temporary offices during the structure's restoration. Much of the asbestos on the exterior of the building (used to waterproof the dome) had been removed that summer by inmates from the Utah State Prison, working in the Utah Correctional Industries program. Some of the major improvements made during the renovation included updating or replacing the heating, cooling, plumbing, and electrical systems. Many rooms in the structure were restored to their original size, having been divided into smaller rooms over time; while others, like the Senate Chamber, were enlarged. Rooms were repainted their original colors, and new carpets, matching the 1916 originals, were installed. The 550 original windows had been replaced with aluminum trimmed ones in the early 1960s, and during the restoration they were replaced with replicated mahogany-trimmed, energy efficient, and in some areas bulletproof, windows. Original furniture was restored, and new period furniture was purchased. The floor of the rotunda had originally included glass, which allowed light to pass from the skylights down to the first floor, and the glass was restored during the renovations. One area which received much attention was the building's dome. The dome's drum, or circular base, experienced water leakage for many years. Contrary to architect Kletting's design, the state had used stucco and plaster, versus terra cotta, to give the appearance of stone on the exterior of the dome. Over time, the plaster deteriorated and allowed water penetration that damaged the interior murals. In an effort to stop this the state had coated the drum area with a coating made of asbestos. During the restoration, the asbestos was removed, and actual terra cotta replaced the leaking plaster and stucco. In the dome's interior structure, a cathodic protection system was installed to prevent any further damage to the concrete and steel. The system uses a network of electrical anodes to induce a small electric current into the steel, altering the electrolytic cycle and slowing the corrosion process. To help increase the dome's strength, a new six-inch shot concrete wall was applied over the existing concrete inside the dome's structure. Arguably the largest part of the renovation was improving the building's resistance to earthquake damage. A base isolation system was installed under the building to provide this protection. The building's isolation system is composed of a network of 280 base isolators, each high, and between and in diameter. Installing the isolators required excavating the dirt around and beneath the capitol, exposing the foundation and footings. The original concrete support columns were then attached to a network of new load transfer beams, which extended horizontally from under the building, and were supported by pile caps under and along the perimeter of the capitol. The support columns were then detached from the original footings, leaving the building sitting on the load transfer beams and pile caps. A new concrete mat was poured around and on top of the original footings, leaving a space between the new load transfer beams and the concrete mat. The base isolators were then installed on top of the concrete mat, directly above the covered footings. Once all the isolators had been installed the temporary supports between the pile caps and load transfer beams were removed, leaving the beams to sit directly on the isolators, which sit on the concrete mat foundation. The isolators are made of layers of laminated rubber, and are very strong vertically but not horizontally, which allows the building to rock gently back and forth as the ground underneath moves during an earthquake. Several other improvements during the renovation will help to improve the building's stability, including the addition of concrete shear walls within the structure. The sheer walls will keep the building from twisting or distorting, which could cause a collapse as it moves during an earthquake. The sheer walls were installed in empty vent shafts left from the original construction, and inside new elevator shafts and stairwells. The granite columns along the structure's exterior were also in danger of buckling during a seismic event, and as a result the joints were injected with an epoxy adhesive during the renovation work. The innovative restoration and upgrade was the first of its kind on such a large scale. The final cost was $260 million (equivalent to $ in ) which did not include the construction of two additional legislative office buildings on the capitol campus at a cost of $37 million each (equivalent to $ in ). The capitol was rededicated on January 4, 2008, and opened to the public the next day. Funds dedicated to the capitol complex make it the costliest state capitol complex in the United States. Architecture =Exterior= The South Entrance The capitol's architecture was inspired by Classical architecture, and some local newspapers compared the early designs to Greece's Parthenon. Many of the building's details rely on the Corinthian style, in which formality, order, proportion and line are essential design elements. The building is feet long, feet wide, and the dome is high. The exterior is constructed of Utah granite (Quartz monzonite mined in nearby Little Cottonwood Canyon), as are other Salt Lake City landmarks such as the Salt Lake Temple and LDS Conference Center. The stone facade is symmetrical, with each side being organized around a central pedimented entrance. Fifty-two Corinthian columns, each tall by in diameter sitting on an exposed foundation podium, surround around the south (front), east and west sides of the capitol. =Interior= The building's interior has five floors (four main floors and a basement). The capitol is decorated with many paintings and sculptures depicting Utah's history and heritage, including statues of Brigham Young, first territorial governor, and Philo T. Farnsworth, Utah native and a developer of television. The floors are made of marble from Georgia. Basement The basement has been heavily remodeled throughout the years, and much of the eastern half of the basement has been replaced by the base isolators (which are meant to make the building more resistant to earthquakes). Because of the slope of the ground under the building the western half of the capitol still contains a full basement, with base isolators underneath. During the 2004-2008 restoration a terrace was constructed which surrounds the building on the east, west, and south sides; this terrace extended the basement level beyond the original walls. Today the basement houses maintenance and security offices, mechanical and storage space, several conference and meeting rooms, the Legislative Printing Office, Bill Room, and a fitness center. The Capitol Hill Association, a group of political lobbyists, also rents space in the basement for a lounge. First floor The First Floor The first floor, or ground floor, was the first completed and has the least amount of decorative finish work. The exterior stairs on the east and west ends of the building lead to this level, versus the front steps which lead directly to the second floor. When first completed in 1916 the ground floor was mostly a vast, open exhibit space spanning the entire length of the building, while offices were built in the four corners of this level. The ceiling beneath the rotunda above is made of glass (which also serves as the floor above), and allows light from the 2nd floor to illuminate the ground floor also. Over time the large open areas of the ground floor were walled in and divided, extending the offices into the public space. Now the ground floor still contains many of the capitol's exhibits, and includes a small visitor center and gift shop. Second floor The rotunda and dome interior The Rotunda and stairs to the second floor in the background. The building's second floor often referred to as the main floor, has retained much of its historic appearance over the years. This floor also serves as the first level of the three-story rotunda and flanking atria. The rotunda occupies the center of the building, under the dome. The interior ceiling of the dome, which reaches above the floor, includes a large painting by artist William Slater. The mural includes seagulls flying amongst clouds, and was chosen because the California gull is Utah's official state bird and represents the Miracle of the gulls from Utah's history. Also within the dome is a cyclorama, with eight scenes from Utah's history, including the driving of the Golden Spike and the naming of Ensign Peak; the characters in the scenes of the cyclorama stand approximately high. When the capitol was opened in 1916 the cyclorama was blank, and was not painted until the 1930s, as a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project. The dome is supported by marble covered, coffered arches, which sit on four pendentives. The coffered arches each depict a scene from Utah's history including the exploration of Utah by John C. Frémont, the Domínguez–Escalante expedition, the fur trapping done by Peter Skene Ogden and lastly the arrival of the Mormons Pioneers led by Brigham Young. At the bottom of the pendentives surrounding the rotunda are niches containing statues. The niches are original to the building, but until the restoration they remained empty. Prior to the renovations, three artists, Eugene L. Daub, Robert Firmin, and Jonah Hendrickson were commissioned to create statues to fill them. The four statues, each approximately tall and known collectively as \\"The Great Utahs\\" represent Science and Technology, Land and Community, Immigration and Settlement, along with the Arts and Education. Suspended from the dome's ceiling is the original chandelier weighing (The chain supporting it weighs an additional ). The chandelier is an exact copy of one hanging in the Arkansas State Capitol, and during the restoration process Arkansas sent several, period glass diffusers to Utah to replace broken ones found in its chandelier. The second floor, showing the west atrium Flanking the east and west sides of the rotunda are atria, which contain large skylights, allowing sunlight to enter the public areas. Surrounding the atria are two levels of balconies which are supported by twenty-four monolithic, Ionic style columns. At the end of each atriim is a marble staircase, and a mural. The arched mural on the west end, above the entrance to the House Chamber is entitled the Passing of the Wagons, while the mural at east end, above the entrance to the Supreme Court, is known as the Madonna of the Wagon. Both murals were meant as a tribute to the early pioneers, and were the first commissioned works of art in the capitol, being signed by Girard Hale and Gilbert White. The state reception room, or gold room, is also located on this floor, and is often used to entertain visiting dignitaries. The gold room gets its name from the extensive usage of gold leaf in its decoration. The ceiling contains a painting entitled Children at Play by New York artist Lewis Schettle. The majority of finishings and furniture in the room have been imported from Europe, including the Russian walnut table, and several chairs are upholstered with Queen Elizabeth's coronation fabric. Just west of the gold room, is the Governor's office. Third floor The third floor, also known as the legislative floor, contains the chambers for both the House and Senate, along with the Supreme Court. When the building was first completed the north-east corner of this floor contained the library, which has since been relocated, and the area divided into smaller offices. At the end of the west atrium area is the entrance to the House of Representatives. The House is composed of 75 members, who serve two-year terms, and represent approximately 40,000 citizens each. During the restoration the House chamber was restored to the original paint colors and period carpets. Two plasma display screens were installed at the front of the chamber for voting processes and presentations, a first of its kind system in a state capitol. New desks were created, based on the originals, but now allow room for modern technology such as printers and computers. The ceiling of the chamber is a large skylight, allowing natural light to illuminate the room. The chamber also features four murals painted on the rounded ceiling coves, two of which (east and west) are original to the buildings, while the other two were painted during the renovation. The east mural, entitled The Dream of Brigham Young was painted by New York artist, Vincent Aderente, and shows Young standing near the Salt Lake Temple and holding their blueprints. The east mural, entitled Discovery of the Great Salt Lake, shows Brigham Young conversing with Jim Bridger about the Great Salt Lake, and is the work of A. E. Foringer. The north mural features Utah resident, Seraph Young, voting in Utah's first election following the granting of women's suffrage in the territory. The south mural features the Engen brothers building their first Ski jump, representing the importance of outdoor recreation to the economy of Utah. The House Lounge, located directly behind the chamber, was restored to its original size and configuration, and furnished with period carpets and furniture. The Senate chamber, which houses the Utah State Senate, is located in the northern part of the center wing. The Senate is composed of 29 members, who serve for terms of four-years. Senators sit facing north, towards the speaker. The chamber was expanded during the renovation, removing the walls on each side, opening what were hallways to the floor of the chamber. Like the House's chamber, the Senate Chamber was restored with original paint colors and period furniture. Included within the chamber are three murals, the first is original to the building, and was painted across the entire, upper-part, of the front wall. The mural, known as a polyptych, is a landscape by A.B. Wright and Lee Greene Richards showing Utah Lake, located a 45-minute drive south of the capitol, in Utah County. During the restoration, two new paintings, by Logan artist Keith Bond were painted. The eastern mural, entitled Orchards along the Foothills, shows the Wasatch Mountains of Northern Utah. The western mural, entitled Ancestral Home shows an Anasazi ruin amongst the red-rock hills of Southern Utah. The Supreme Court chamber is located at the far east end of building. The chamber is currently only used for ceremonial purposes as the Utah Supreme Court relocated to the Scott M. Matheson Courthouse in downtown Salt Lake City in 1998. Fourth floor Both historically and after its renovation, the fourth floor contains the viewing galleries for both the house and senate chambers, along with several offices and committee rooms. Much of the floor is open to floors below, allowing visitors to look down on the third or second floors in several locations. When the capitol opened, this floor was also used as an art gallery, and currently it contains several small exhibits along with a statue of Philo Farnsworth, a developer of television and a Utah native. Grounds and Capitol Complex State Capitol building and south grounds. The Mormon Battalion monument is to the right, and the obelisk-shaped monument on top of Ensign Peak is barely visible to the right of the Mormon Battalion monument. The capitol building is the centerpiece of a plot which also includes a Vietnam War memorial, Utah Law Enforcement Memorial, and a monument dedicated to the Mormon Battalion. The renovations added a new plaza, a reflecting pool, and two office buildings, as well as underground parking. The grounds feature plants, shrubs, and trees native to Utah, as well as good views of Salt Lake City, the Salt Lake Valley and the Wasatch Front. =Other buildings= State Office Building By the 1950s the capitol was reaching capacity, and there was little room to expand offices in the building without making drastic changes to the historical layout. As a result, the state legislature appropriated $3 million (equivalent to $ in ) to construct a new office building, located about directly north of the capitol. A new master plan was also created during the design process which specified creating a new plaza which would connect the two buildings and cover a new underground parking facility. The other parking lots in the complex were expanded and a maintenance shop was constructed for state vehicles. The new plan also set aside space for the construction of two more office buildings on the east and west sides of the plaza. The new building was designed by Scott & Beecher Architecture, and was smaller than the capitol building but contained much more usable working space. The finished plans were completed and presented to the state during November 1958. the building is scheduled for demolition in 2021 as it is not suitable to withstand an earthquake and the cost of demolition was lower than retrofitting the structure. The offices formerly housed in the structure began moving in January 2020 to the former American Express building in Taylorsville which was built in the 1980's. The building on 2700 West alongside Interstate 215 is adjacent to the state crime lab and the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) headquarters and had recently undergone interior remodeling. Construction of the new building started with a groundbreaking ceremony held March 8, 1959. Because the new plan required a large amount of excavation work, the removed dirt was used to build up the ground for Interstate 15, also under construction during that period. After the building was completed, it was dedicated on June 9, 1961. = House Building = Located on the west side of the capitol complex, the Rebecca D. Lockhart House Building primarily serves as the location for the large number of offices for members of the Utah House of Representatives. The lower floor of the building contains several committee rooms and the upper floor houses the Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel.  Senate Building  Located on the east side of the capitol complex, the East Senate Building holds additional offices for members of the Utah Senate. The main floor also holds The State Room, a dining room for the Capitol Café, and the second floor contains two committee rooms. Located under this building is the private lobbyist lounge, managed by the Capitol Hill Association of Lobbyists. In popular culture In Legally Blonde 2: Red, White and Blonde (2003) the Utah State Capitol was used for exterior and interior pictures of the U.S. Capitol. In Drive Me Crazy (1999), the Centennial prom scene was filmed in the Capitol Rotunda.

In June 1855, attempting to alleviate pressure on the defence of Sevastopol, Emperor Alexander II ordered General Nikolay Muravyov to lead his troops against areas of Ottoman interest in Asia Minor. Uniting disparate contingents under his command into a strong corps of 25,725 soldiers, 96 light guns, Muravyov decided to attack Kars, the most important fortress of Eastern Anatolia. Late in 1854, British General William Fenwick Williams had been sent to Kars to assess the situation and report directly to Lord Raglan (FitzRoy Somerset, 1st Baron Raglan), the commander-in-chief of the British expeditionary forces in the Crimea. Williams found the city in a deplorable state. The Ottoman forces included many newly-conscripted recruits, the men had not been paid in months and many had obsolete weapons. Support services such as hospitals were nonexistent. Many of the senior Ottoman officers were absent and lived in Istanbul. Morale was low and desertion high. Appalled by the situation, Williams took command along with several other foreign officers. He quickly set to work to institute discipline, train the troops and reinforce the city's defences. By the spring of 1855, 17,000 troops in high spirits stood ready to defend Kars. Sir William Williams, 1st Baronet, of Kars by William Gush, Province House (Nova Scotia) The first attack was repulsed by the Ottoman garrison under Williams. Muravyov's second assault pushed the Turks back, and he took the main road and the heights over the city, but the renewed vigour of the Ottoman troops took the Russians by surprise. The ferocious fighting that had ensued made them change tactics and start a siege that would last until late November. Upon hearing news of the attack, Ottoman Commander Omar Pasha asked for Ottoman troops to be moved from the line at the Siege of Sevastopol and redeployed to Asia Minor mainly with the idea of relieving Kars. After many delays, primarily put in place by Napoleon III, Omar Pasha left the Crimea for Sukhumi with 45,000 soldiers on 6 September. Omar Pasha's arrival on the Black Sea coast north of Kars induced Muravyov to begin a third assault on the Ottoman forces, which had been nearly starved. On 29 September, the Russians undertook a general attack on Kars, which lasted seven hours with extreme desperation, but they were repulsed. General Williams remained isolated, however, as Omar Pasha never reached the city. Instead of relieving the garrison he plunged into prolonged warfare in Mingrelia and took Sukhumi in the aftermath. In the meantime, the Ottoman reserves in Kars were running out, and the supply lines had been thinned. Heavy snowfall in late October made the Ottoman reinforcement of Kars quite impractical. Selim Pasha, Omar's son, landed another army at the ancient city of Trebizond, to the west, and began marching south to Erzerum to prevent the Russians from advancing further into Anatolia. The Russians sent a small force from the Kars lines to stop his advance and defeated the Ottomans at the River Ingur on 6 November. The garrison of Kars declined to face further hardships of the winter siege and surrendered to General Muravyov on 28 November 1855, according to the Gregorian calendar. Muravyov was authorized by the tsar to change his name to \\"Muravyov-Karsky\\" to commemorate his part in taking the fortress. On entering the city the Russians \\"were immediately horrified to discover masses of men too weak to be evacuated, many of them in the throes of death\\". Despite the lack of aid from Istanbul, Williams remained steadfast to his Ottoman troops and stated that \\"they fell dead at their posts, in the tents, and throughout the camp, as brave men should who cling to their duty through the slightest glimmering of hope of saving a place entrusted to their custody\\".Alexis S.

It may adhere to standards such as the Single UNIX Specification (SUS) or similar POSIX IEEE standard. No single published standard describes all Unix architecture computer operating systems - this is in part a legacy of the Unix wars. Description There are many systems which are Unix-like in their architecture. Notable among these are the GNU/Linux distributions. The distinctions between Unix and Unix-like systems have been the subject of heated legal battles, and the holders of the UNIX brand, The Open Group, object to \\"Unix-like\\" and similar terms. For distinctions between SUS branded UNIX architectures and other similar architectures, see Unix-like. Kernel A Unix kernel -- the core or key components of the operating system -- consists of many kernel subsystems like process management, scheduling, file management, device management, network management, memory management, and dealing with interrupts from hardware devices. Each of the subsystems has some features: * Concurrency: As Unix is a multiprocessing OS, many processes run concurrently to improve the performance of the system. * Virtual memory (VM): Memory management subsystem implements the virtual memory concept and users need not worry about the executable program size and the RAM size. * Paging: It is a technique to minimize the internal as well as the external fragmentation in the physical memory. * Virtual file system (VFS): A VFS is a file system used to help the user to hide the different file systems complexities. A user can use the same standard file system related calls to access different file systems. The kernel provides these and other basic services: interrupt and trap handling, separation between user and system space, system calls, scheduling, timer and clock handling, file descriptor management. Features Some key features of the Unix architecture concept are: * Unix systems use a centralized operating system kernel which manages system and process activities. * All non-kernel software is organized into separate, kernel-managed processes. * Unix systems are preemptively multitasking: multiple processes can run at the same time, or within small time slices and nearly at the same time, and any process can be interrupted and moved out of execution by the kernel. This is known as thread management. * Files are stored on disk in a hierarchical file system, with a single top location throughout the system (root, or \\"/\\"), with both files and directories, subdirectories, sub-subdirectories, and so on below it. * With few exceptions, devices and some types of communications between processes are managed and visible as files or pseudo-files within the file system hierarchy. This is known as everything is a file. However, Linus Torvalds states that this is inaccurate and may be better rephrased as \\"everything is a stream of bytes\\". The UNIX operating system supports the following features and capabilities: * Multitasking and multiuser * Programming interface * Use of files as abstractions of devices and other objects * Built-in networking (TCP/IP is standard) * Persistent system service processes called \\"daemons\\" and managed by init or inet Criticism The Unix-Haters Handbook covers some of these design features as failures from the user point of view. However, although some information is quite dated and cannot be applied to modern Unixes or Unix-like operating systems such as Linux, Eric S. Raymond discovered that several issues are still prevailing, while others were resolved. Raymond concludes that not all concepts behind Unix can be deemed as non-functional even though the book's intention may have been to portray Unix as inferior without encouraging discussions with developers to actually fix the issues.

This set is a solution stack, and an open source web platform. BAPP refers to: *BSD, family of operating systems; *Apache, the web server; *PostgreSQL, the database management system (or database server); *Perl, PHP, Python, and/or Primate (mod mono), scripting/programming languages. BAMP refers to: *BSD, family of operating systems; *Apache, the web server; *MySQL, the database management system (or database server); *Perl, PHP, Python, and/or Primate (mod mono), scripting/programming languages. The two acronyms have three major uses: #Define a web server infrastructure #Define a programming paradigm of developing software #Define a software distribution package Underlying BSD family of operating systems  As an operating system, FreeBSD (a BSD descendant) is generally regarded as reliable and robust, and of the operating systems that accurately report uptime remotely, FreeBSD (and other BSD descendants) are the most common free operating system listed in Netcraft's list of the 50 web servers with the longest uptime (uptime on some operating systems such as some versions of Linux cannot be determined remotely), making it a top choice among ISPs and hosting providers. A long uptime also indicates that no kernel updates have been deemed necessary, as installing a new kernel requires a reboot and resets the uptime counter of the system. Solution stack Though the originators of these open source programs did not design them all to work specifically with each other, the combination has become popular because of its low acquisition cost and because of the ubiquity of its components (which come bundled with most current BSD distributions particularly as deployed by ISPs). When used in combination they represent a solution stack of technologies that support application servers. Other such stacks include unified application development environments such as Apple Computer's WebObjects, Java/Java EE, Grails, and Microsoft's .NET architecture. Interface The scripting component of the BAPP stack has its origins in the CGI web interfaces that became popular in the early 1990s. This technology allows the user of a web browser to execute a program on the web server, and to thereby receive dynamic as well as static content. Programmers used scripting languages with these programs because of their ability to manipulate text streams easily and efficiently, even when they originate from disparate sources. For this reason system designers often referred to such scripting systems as glue languages. Variants Other variants of the term include: *Instead of BSD: LAPP, using Linux.

It is a live album recorded at the Sydney Entertainment Centre on 14 December 1986 with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra. Album history The concert, recorded on 14 December 1986, was the last of a series of concerts done throughout the last two months of 1986, which were part of John's Tour De Force (tour) of Australia and New Zealand. The concerts consisted of two sets: the first was limited to John and his 14-piece band, including backing vocalists and the Onward International horn section, and his flamboyant stage dress, featuring Mohawk and Tina Turner wigs and some outlandish eyewear; the second featured John, the band and the 88-piece Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, with him dressed as Mozart. John's band was essentially the lineup used on Leather Jackets, which he was touring behind at the time, including Jody Linscott and special guest Ray Cooper, both of whom played percussion. James Newton Howard, who was at the time an up-and-coming film composer in Hollywood, joined John to conduct and write larger, augmented charts of not only his own previous work on \\"Tonight,\\" but also Paul Buckmaster's original arrangements, since the music was to be played by 88 musicians, instead of the smaller studio orchestra for which the compositions were originally designed. He also wrote brand new full orchestra parts for songs such as \\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\\", which previously only had horn arrangements. The album features most of the songs recorded in the second half of the show, excluding \\"Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting\\", \\"Carla/Etude\\", \\"Cold as Christmas (In the Middle of the Year)\\" and \\"Slow Rivers\\", which was sung by John alone (John dueted \\"Slow Rivers\\" with Cliff Richard on Leather Jackets). John's live sound engineer, Clive Franks, handled the recording of the band (assisted by Keith Walker and Dennis Fox), while album producer Gus Dudgeon supervised recording of the orchestra by Leon Minervini and Nic Jeremy. Dudgeon took the tapes back to Wisseloord Studios in the Netherlands for mixing with engineer Graham Dickson, who had also worked on Leather Jackets. This concert was the last to feature Elton's legendary stage costumes, which he had featured in his shows since the early 1970s. It was also his last show before undergoing throat surgery in January 1987. Despite being completely successful, the surgery prevented Elton from singing and touring for several months and permanently altered his voice.

In terms of audio, the \\"Elton & His Band\\" portion, \\"Daniel\\" and \\"Medley: Song for You, Blue Eyes, I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues\\" were issued in 1988 as bonus tracks on the Rocket Records maxi- single for \\"A Word in Spanish\\" (UK/Europe only) as EJSCD 18, 872 299-2. The audio from \\"Carla/Etude\\" from the concert appeared on the To Be Continued... boxed set. =CD editions= The running time of the original 1987 US CD release on MCA Records (MCAD-8022) is 73:58, whilst the 1998 remastered CD edition on Mercury/Island Records (314 558 477-2) runs only 73:48. The missing time is due to the removal of several seconds of applause following the song \\"Tonight\\". The track listing for both editions is the same. However, the running time of most of the remastered tracks vary from the original release due to a different placement of the track marks between songs. In many cases, the track mark changes move a song's spoken introduction from the beginning of the track to the end of the preceding track. =Singles= The live version of \\"Candle in the Wind\\" (b/w \\"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word\\") was released as a single in the US in 1987, peaking at No. 6 in the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and in the UK in 1988, peaking at No. 5.

In 1900, an improved design featuring primarily a shorter barrel and wider grips was introduced as the M1900. These designations were applied retroactively after FN began manufacture of other Browning pistol designs; initially the M1900 was marketed as simply the \\"Pistolet Browning\\" (Browning Pistol). Production ceased only 11 years later, with a total of about 700,000+ units having been produced. United States President Theodore Roosevelt owned a mother of pearl-gripped M1900, which he regularly kept on his person and in his bedside drawer. Eugen Schauman, a Finnish nationalist activist, assassinated the Governor-General Nikolay Bobrikov (the highest Russian authority in the Grand Duchy of Finland) with a Browning pistol on June 16, 1904, in Helsinki. The act was followed by spontaneous anti-Russian celebrations in the streets of Helsinki and after the 1917 independence Schauman was considered to be a national hero of Finland.

Watson's satires are often political in nature. His style is generally contemporary folk music, he also writes and performs children's songs, conventional folk–country music and political songs. He has issued seven solo albums Politics, Religion and Sex (1990), Real World: Songs of Life, Love & Laughter (1994), Out My Window (1999), Are We There Yet? (2004), A Moving Feast (2004), Balance (2010) and Mosaic (2017). Early life and education Bruce Morrisby Watson was born on 12 February 1956 at Terang, a town in rural south-western Victoria. Bruce Watson was educated at Eltham, Brighton Road St. Kilda and Kew primary schools; for secondary education he went to Kew High and then Wesley College. The son of a clergyman and a language teacher, Watson developed a social conscience and a love of language that have influenced his songwriting and his professional career, first as an academic (tutoring in Political Science and Linguistics) and later working in various branches of the Victorian Public Service.https://brucewatsonmusic.wordpress.com/2012/04/22/not-my-funeral-the- things-i-do Retrieved 8 August 2018 Musical career In 1990 Watson released his debut album, Politics, Sex and Religion. One of the tracks, \\"Amazon\\", was later covered by fellow folk artists Blackwood, Eric Bogle, and Zamponistas, as well as a number of other performers in Europe and the United States.http://www.brucewatsonmusic.com/bio.html Retrieved 8 August 2018 In May that year, he launched his book, Songs of a Satirical Bloke, with the Canberra Times Mike Jackson, describing him as \\"an academic with a wicked sense of humour\\". In April 1994 he performed at the National Folk Festival in Canberra, with the Canberra Times reporter, Graham McDonald, describing his work as \\"dreadfully funny parodies\\". Also that year he issued his second album, Real World: Songs of Life, Love & Laughter. Watson has been called a \\"major Australian songwriter and performer in the folk tradition\\", and \\"an icon of the Australian folk scene.\\" He has performed at over 150 folk music festivals, as well as folk clubs, coffee houses, and house concerts throughout Australia and New Zealand. Watson has won several \\"songwriting awards\\", such as the Declan Affley Memorial Songwriting Award at the Australia National Folk Festival, the Lawson Paterson Songwriting Award at Port Fairy, and the Roddy Read Memorial Songwriting Award at Maldon Folk Festival.http://www.brucewatsonmusic.com/bio.html Retrieved 8 August 2018 Watson collaborates with singer-songwriters Wendy Ealey and Moira Tyers in the audio-visual theme concert presentations, Unsung Heroes of Australian History,http://www.unsungheroesofaustralianhistory.com Retrieved 8 August 2018 at various folk festivals and concert venues.

Watson's song Lake Pedder Again from his Balance CD has appeared on The Folk Show on Radio Adelaide.  Songs  =The Man and the Woman and the Edison Phonograph= Horace Watson recording the songs of Fanny Cochrane Smith, considered to be the last fluent speaker of a Tasmanian language, 1903. Watson's great grandfather was Horace Watson (1862–1930), a pharmacist, who, in 1888 in Hobart, had married Louisa née Keen (died 1936) (sixth daughter of Joseph Keen, inventor of Keen's Curry) who was the recent widow of Robert Williamson. In 1899 and in 1903 Horace recorded traditional language songs by indigenous Tasmanian, Fanny Cochrane Smith. Horace and Louisa ran the Keen's Curry company. The lead track on Watson's third album, Out My Window, \\"The Man & the Woman & the Edison Phonograph\\", told the history behind a family photo which depicts Horace Watson recording Tasmanian Aboriginal elder, Fanny Cochrane Smith's vocals in 1903. A similar photo was displayed at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. Fanny Cochrane Smith (1834–1905)was the last fluent speaker of Tasmanian language. In the early 2000s Watson was performing at the National Folk Festival when he met Ronnie Summers, the great great grandson of Cochrane-Smith. Summers is a Tasmanian Aboriginal Elder also a folk singer. He joined with Watson in a rendition of \\"The Man & the Woman & the Edison Phonograph\\" in 2005. Watson and Summers recorded the track as a duet for Watson's 2010 album, Balance. At the National Folk Festival in 2014 Watson the National Film and Sound Archive recorded a short version of the song on a wax cylinder, and this track is included on the 2017 album, Mosaic. =Olegas= The song, Olegas, on the album Out My Window, tells the story of Lithuanian/Tasmanian conservationist and photographer Olegas Truchanas, who led the fight against the flooding of Lake Pedder by the Hydro Electric Commission and was influential in the development of Australia's conservation movement. In 2013 the song was translated into Lithuanian for performance at a celebration of Truchanas’ birth, in his home town of Šiauliai, Lithuania. In June 2018, Bruce Watson visited Šiauliai, and participated in a concert at Truchanas’ former school, the Šiauliai Gymnasium (Lithuanian: Šiaulių Juliaus Janonio gimnazija), where he and the students performed various versions of the song.[CITATION]  Bibliography  * *  Discography  * Politics, Religion and Sex (1990) * Real World: Songs of Life, Love & Laughter (1994) * Out My Window (1999) * Are We There Yet?

It was first observed on 11 December 2004, by astronomers with the Canada–France Ecliptic Plane Survey at the Mauna Kea Observatories, Hawaii, United States. The highly inclined dwarf planet candidate measures approximately in diameter. With its perihelion of 51 AU, it belongs to a small and poorly understood group of very distant objects with moderate eccentricities.  Discovery and naming  Buffy was discovered on 11 December 2004. It was discovered by astronomers led by (Rhiannon) Lynne Allen of the University of British Columbia as part of the Canada–France Ecliptic Plane Survey (CFEPS) using the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) near the ecliptic. The team included Brett Gladman, John Kavelaars, Jean-Marc Petit, Joel Parker and Phil Nicholson. In 2015, six precovery images from 2002 and 2003 were found in Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. The object was nicknamed \\"Buffy\\" by the discovery team, after the fictional vampire slayer Buffy Summers, and proposed several Inuit-based official names to the International Astronomical Union.  Orbit and classification  Buffy is located in the \\"gap\\", a poorly understood region. Buffy orbits the Sun at a distance of 51.1–63.4 AU once every 433 years and 3 months (158,242 days; semi-major axis of 57.26 AU). Its orbit has a moderate eccentricity of 0.11 and a high inclination of 47° with respect to the ecliptic. It belongs to the same group as , , and (also see diagram), that are poorly understood for their large perihelia combined with moderate eccentricities. Considered a scattered and detached object, Buffy is particularly unusual as it has an unusually circular orbit for a scattered- disc object (SDO). Although it is thought that traditional scattered-disc objects have been ejected into their current orbits by gravitational interactions with Neptune, the low eccentricity of its orbit and the distance of its perihelion (SDOs generally have highly eccentric orbits and perihelia less than 38 AU) seems hard to reconcile with such celestial mechanics. This has led to some uncertainty as to the current theoretical understanding of the outer Solar System. The theories include close stellar passages, unseen planet/rogue planets/planetary embryos in the early Kuiper belt, and resonance interaction with an outward-migrating Neptune. The Kozai mechanism is capable of transferring orbital eccentricity to a higher inclination. The object is also the largest possible dwarf planet that has an inclination larger than 45°, traveling further \\"up and down\\" than \\"left to right\\" around the Sun when viewed edge-on along the ecliptic. = Most distant objects = Buffy came to aphelion around 1901. Other than long-period comets, it is currently about the thirteenth-most-distant known large body (57.5 AU) in the Solar System with a well-known orbit, after and Dysnomia (96.3 AU), Gonggong (87.4 AU), (85.9 AU), (84.0 AU), (83.3 AU), (83.3 AU), (80.3 AU), (70.5 AU), (60.3 AU), (59.8 AU), and (59.6 AU).  Physical characteristics  With assumed albedos between 0.04 and 0.25, and absolute magnitudes from 4.3 to 4.6, Buffy has an estimated diameter of 335 to 850 kilometers; the mean arrived at by considering the two single-figure estimates plus the centre points of the three ranges is 562 km, approximately a quarter the diameter of Pluto. On his website, American astronomer Michael Brown lists Buffy as a \\"likely\\" dwarf planet (500–600 km), which is the category with the 3rd highest certainty in his 5-class taxonomic system. As of 2018, no well-documented spectral type and color indices, nor a rotational lightcurve have been obtained from spectroscopic and photometric observations; however, the Johnston's Archive lists a \\"taxonomic type\\" of \\"BR\\", and a \\"B-R magnitude\\" of 1.24. The rotation period, pole and shape officially remain unknown.

Chaffin's Bluff on the north side of the river opposite Drewry's Bluff, long-considered a major defense point of the river below Richmond. Located at a major bend in the river about eight miles south of Richmond, both bluffs were fortified by the Confederates early in the American Civil War. A Union attempt to take Richmond by water by the ironclad USS Monitor and other Union warships during the Peninsula Campaign failed to get past the defenses at this location during the Battle of Drewry's Bluff on May 15, 1862. Chaffin's Bluff and Chaffin's Farm (later renamed Fort Harrison) were adjacent to each other. Oscar F. Baxter, a surgeon in the Confederate Army, told of his posting to Chaffin's Farm in a letter from Richmond dated June 6, 1864 to his twelve-year-old daughter. (Dr. Baxter, a native of Camden County, North Carolina, was a widower; his daughter was being cared for by relatives.) I am about to get off for Chaffin's Farm, about 10 miles from Richmond. I received orders the 1st of June, but have been too unwell to obey them till this morning...I have been worked down and there is no end of it—I have never seen so many badly wounded men together as I have seen in the Yankee Hospital—800 or more all desperately wounded. My hands have been in dreadful condition from wounds received in operating on them. The fighting is still going on near Rich-- Two months later, in an August 18 letter to his daughter from \\"Post hospital, Chaffin's Bluff,\\" Dr. Baxter describes the locale. I have just learnt the probable cause of the miscarriage of your letters. I am at Chaffin's Bluff and not Chaffin's Farm, where I was first ordered. The Headquarters of both Bluff and farm are all in sight - half or threequarters of a mile apart... In a letter to her dated the previous day (August 17), he hopes to get a few days furlough after this demonstration of the Yanks is over. Later in that letter, he describes the fighting going on around him. The Yanks are very near here, have been fighting for two days—shot and shell flying all in sight of my hospital. It is possible I shall have to move out of the building tomorrow. (The actual letters from which the above excerpts are taken are in the possession of Dr. Baxter's great-grandson, who lives in Baltimore County, Maryland. Earlier, Dr. Baxter had been an assistant surgeon in the United States Navy; excerpts from a letter to his fiancée dated October 1, 1846, posted from the Pensacola, Florida navy yard, where his ship, the frigate Potomac had called en route to the U.S.-Mexican War are included in that article under the section \\"Letter from a Naval surgeon on board the frigate 'Potomac' en route to Mexico.\\" When North Carolina seceded from the Union at the time of the Civil War, he joined the Confederate army.) In The Civil War: Day by Day—An Almanac 1861-1865, by E. B. Long with Barbara Long, published in 1971, it is noted that, on August 15, 1864, \\"North of the James, east of Richmond, the Federal expedition to Chaffin's Bluff and the capital's defenses encountered delays and frustration at the hands of Confederate defenders.\\" The book also refers to the \\"Battle of Fort Harrison or Chaffin's Farm, Virginia,\\" which took place on September 30, 1864. \\"After losing Fort Harrison on the previous day, (General Robert E.) Lee directed vigorous counterattacks. but the Federals, having virtually turned the earthwork around, beat off the Southern assaults. This ended major Federal attempts against Richmond from north of the James. The Confederates constructed new outer works between the Fort Harrison line and Richmond, while the Federals built up and manned siege lines east of the Confederate capital.\\" On a map included in Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, published in 1881 by Jefferson Davis, the president of the late Confederate States, Chaffin's Bluff is noted as \\"Chapin Bluff\\"; using the scale of the map, it is 8.5 miles down the James River from Richmond. Drewry's Bluff is part of the Fort Darling unit of the Richmond National Battlefield Park. Visitors can view the gun emplacements, the earthworks, and appreciate the commanding views and control over the river the bluff affords. However, in modern times, singer and businessman Jimmy Dean and his wife Donna Meade Dean made their home at Chaffin's Bluff, which is located on private property on the Henrico County side of the river. The singer-businessman died peacefully at his home there on Sunday, June 13, 2010, according to his widow.

Recurring themes include the dangers of being exposed to solar radiation and the possibility of escaping excessive radiation by staying within the planet's slow-moving terminator (the boundary between day and night). Another recurring theme is autocratic governments, perhaps because of an association of Mercury with hot- temperedness. Nonetheless, there may be scientific support, based on studies reported in March 2020, for considering that parts of the planet may have been habitable, and perhaps that actual life forms, albeit likely primitive microorganisms, may have existed on the planet after all. Description Giovanni Schiaparelli announced in 1889 that Mercury was tidally locked to the Sun, orbiting with one face permanently turned toward it and another face turned away. Theories stated that the \\"brightside\\" had molten metal puddles, the \\"darkside\\" had the planet's former atmosphere in frozen form, and a \\"twilight belt\\" between the two. This concept of Mercury was disproven in 1965, when radio astronomers discovered that Mercury rotates three times for every two revolutions, exposing all of its surface to the Sun, except for craters of eternal darkness. Authors' descriptions of Mercury changed as knowledge of the planet's environment increased. Fictional works about Mercury can thus be divided into two groups; those, mostly written before 1965, featuring the \\"Old\\" Mercury with its light and dark sides, and those that reflect more recent scientific knowledge of the planet. Literature =\\"Old Mercury\\"= \\"Lava Falls on Mercury\\", cover art by 400px * In Eric Rücker Eddison's The Worm Ouroboros (1922), the action takes place in a fantasy world that is ostensibly part of the planet Mercury. However, the name is used purely for its exotic value, and there is no attempt to make the characteristics of the world correspond to any facts known or believed about Mercury in the 1920s. Eddison's Mercury resembles Earth in all respects except in details of geography: it has a normal day-cycle, a moon, and a calendar identical to Earth's. * Tama of the Light Country (1930), Tama, Princess of Mercury (1931) and Aerita of the Light Country (1941) by Ray Cummings are Burroughsian adventures on a tidally-locked Mercury. * The planet is briefly mentioned in H. P. Lovecraft's The Shadow Out of Time (1936): ::Later, as the Earth's span closed, the transferred minds (of the Great Race of Yith) would again migrate through time and space — to another stopping place in the bodies of the bulbous vegetable entities of Mercury. * In Leigh Brackett's short stories (especially \\"The Demons of Darkside\\" (1941), \\"A World Is Born\\" (1941), \\"Cube from Space\\" (1942), and \\"Shannach – the Last\\" (1952)), a tidally locked Mercury features a 'Twilight Belt' exposed to dangerous variations in heat and cold and havoc-wreaking solar storms. Some of Brackett's most colorful characters, like Jaffa Storm (\\"Shadow Over Mars\\") and Eric John Stark, were Mercury-born. * Mercury is a setting in several of Isaac Asimov's stories, all written before astronomers knew that the planet was not 1:1 tidally locked; in each story, Mercury has a permanent day-side and night-side.  \\"Runaround\\" (Astounding Science Fiction, 1942, later published in the 1950 collection I, Robot) involves a robot specially designed to cope with the intense solar radiation on the planet. \\"The Dying Night\\" (The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, 1956) is a murder mystery in which the suspects are astronomers from Mercury, the Moon, and the asteroid Ceres. The dynamics and living conditions of each of these locations are key to discovering which astronomer is guilty. Lucky Starr and the Big Sun of Mercury (1956) is a juvenile novel, the fourth in the Lucky Starr series. *In C. S. Lewis's novel That Hideous Strength (1945), Mercury, or Viritrilbia, is described as being the birthplace of language in the universe, possibly due to Mercury's association with wisdom. It is by the power of the Oyarsa of Viritrilbia, who is based on the god Mercury or Hermes that Merlinus Ambrosius is enabled to \\"unmake language\\" at the N.I.C.E. banquet in the penultimate chapter. * In Arthur C. Clarke's Islands in the Sky (1952), there is a description of a strange creature that lives on what was then believed to be the permanently dark nightside with only occasional visits to the twilight zone. * In Hal Clement's Iceworld (1953), the silicon-based aliens establish a base on the hot side of the planet. This is not hot enough for them, so they put the base in the middle of a crater with mirrors on the bank to concentrate sunlight to get the necessary temperature. * Erik Van Lhin's Battle on Mercury (1953) – Erik van Lhin was one of the pen names of Lester del Rey. *In \\"The Weather on Mercury\\" by William Morrison, a group searches for a missing explorer in the twilight zone of a Mercury with native life. * Alan E. Nourse's short story \\"Brightside Crossing\\" (Galaxy, 1956) is narrated by the only survivor of four men who attempt the ultimate sporting feat of crossing Mercury's sun-facing hemisphere at perihelion (when Mercury is closest to the sun). * The Kurt Vonnegut novel The Sirens of Titan (1959) is in part set in caves on a tidally locked Mercury, home to peculiar animals known as harmoniums that cling to the walls of the caves and derive their energy from vibrations in the rock. * In Gordon R. Dickson's Necromancer (1962), a base was located on Mercury, used by the Chantry Guild for training beginners in the group. * In Larry Niven's \\"The Coldest Place\\" (1964), an early short story, Niven teases the reader, who is told that the scene is \\"the coldest place in the Solar System\\" and assumes it to be Pluto — only to discover in the end that the actual location is the dark side of Mercury. Though written when Mercury was believed to be tidally locked, the story was published just after the planet was found to rotate in a 2:3 resonance. * Hugh Walters' Mission to Mercury (1965) also assumes Mercury to have a 'dark' side at near absolute zero from which the protagonists must be rescued before they freeze to death. * In C. C. MacApp's \\"The Mercurymen\\" (1965), human survivors of a collapsed civilization live inside branches of a giant vine, with roots in the darkside and which crosses the twilight zone. A group leaves an established settlement to colonize a new branch. * In Valeddom by Robert Gibson (2013) the traditional Twilight Belt version of Mercury is found to be still true - the 1965 'disproof' a deception.Valeddom - Mercury Awaits published by Netherworld Books, imprint of Mirador, Langport, Somerset, 2013 =\\"New Mercury\\"= 350px * In Arthur C. Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama (1973), Mercury is ruled by a hot-tempered government of metal miners that threatens to destroy the alien spacecraft Rama. The novel shares its background of a colonized Solar System with several others, especially Imperial Earth. * In David Brin's Sundiver (1980), the characters spend most of the time in Mercury, between expeditions into the Sun's chromosphere. * In Kim Stanley Robinson's novels and short stories, especially The Memory of Whiteness (1985), \\"Mercurial\\" (in The Planet on the Table, 1986), Blue Mars (1996), and 2312, Mercury is the home of a vast city called Terminator, populated by large numbers of artists and musicians. To avoid the dangerous solar radiation, the city rolls around the planet's equator on tracks, keeping pace with the planet's rotation so that the Sun never rises fully above the horizon. The motive power comes from solar heat expanding the rails on the day side. The city's rulers are called the Lions of Mercury. * In Warren Ellis' and Darick Robertson's Transmetropolitan (1997–2002), a cyberpunk comic book series, Mercury is said to be covered with solar panels, to aid in the power needs of a technologically advanced Earth. * In Grant Morrison's DC One Million (1998), each planet of the solar system is overseen by one member of the future descendants of the Justice League. Mercury is overseen by the Flash of the 853rd century, perhaps as it is associated with the fastest of the Gods. * Ben Bova's Mercury (2005; part of his Grand Tour series) is about the human drama of the exploration of Mercury: why people might be interested in going there (for instance, to harness the intense solar energy that close to the sun), and what challenges there would be. * In Stephen Baxter's Manifold: Space (2000), Mercury is the final stronghold of humanity after successive waves of extraterrestrial colonizers exterminate the human race from the rest of the solar system. It is the site of the human victory against a race of beings known as the Crackers, who seek to dismantle Sol to exploit its energy. * In the Larklight Trilogy by Philip Reeve Mercury is uninhabited. However it once had an interplanetary empire, and lived on an Earth Lost Continent, before they left the Solar System on a large ship. Apparently they were humanoid, but at least some had golden eyes. * In Charles Stross's book Saturn's Children, Mercury resembles Kim Stanley Robinson's, with a city on rails called Terminator. *In Karl Schroeder's 2014 novel Lockstep, set over 14,000 years in the future, Mercury no longer exists, having been used as the raw material to create a Dyson cloud used to power starship launches and posthuman technology. Film and television The planet has also been a setting for several television series: * In the Space Patrol episode \\"The Fires of Mercury\\", Professor Heggarty's device for translating the language of ants also converts heat waves into radio waves. Maria realizes that this might provide a way of transmitting warmth from Mercury to the Colony on Pluto, where freezing conditions worsen as the dwarf planet nears the point in its orbit farthest from the Sun. * In a Star Trek: Voyager show-within-a-show, The Adventures of Captain Proton (first appearing in \\"Night\\" in 1998), Dr. Chaotica was a villain who wanted to conquer the people of Earth and force them to work in the mines of Mercury. * In the animated television series Exosquad (1993–1995), Mercury served as Exofleet's temporary base during the reconquest of the Homeworlds (Venus, Earth, and Mars). * An episode of Futurama had Mercury's circumference faithfully represented by a \\"road sign\\" giving distance to the only vehicle service station on the planet, where Fry and Amy are stuck when her vehicle runs out of fuel. * In the television show Invader Zim (2001), Mercury is turned into a prototype giant spaceship by the extinct Martians. In the episode \\"Battle of the Planets\\", Zim (piloting Mars, also made into a spaceship) and Dib (piloting Mercury) battle each other while flying through the solar system. In the end of the episode, Zim foolishly flies Mars into the Asteroid Belt, almost killing Zim, with Mars flying wildly out of control and nearly hitting Blorch, a fictional planet outside the solar system. * In the 2007 film Sunshine the Icarus II spacecraft goes into orbit around Mercury to rendezvous with the thought-lost Icarus I. * The short lived British TV sitcom Kinvig featured a female, human-like alien from Mercury who was living in a fictional town in England. * In Sailor Moon, Sailor Mercury is Mercury's protector. Her attacks are water and ice-based. * In the Syfy made- for-television film Collision Earth, a solar flare knocks Mercury out of its orbit and sends it on a collision course with Earth.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1887703/ Games and comics * The Buck Rogers comic strip included a Sunday story line \\"Attacked by Mercurians\\" (1/31/32 to 8/7/32), in which Buddy Deering of Earth and Alura Princess of Mars help in the battle between The Kollanians - inhabitants of the eternally frozen hemisphere - and The Odlannians - of the blazing Desert hemisphere, and they create a moon for Mercury.Buck Rogers in the 25th Century: The Complete Newspaper Sundays, Volume One 1930 - 1933, page 114 A later story line has them \\"Exploring the Water Moon of Mercury\\" (1/13/35 to 3/17/35). * In the Transhuman Space roleplaying books by Steve Jackson Games, Mercury is used for production of antimatter and the mining of metals. * Levels 6 and 7 of the computer game Descent take place in installations on Mercury. Level 7 marks the end of the shareware version of the game as well as the game's first boss battle. * In Destiny, Mercury is terraformed by the Vex and it is the home to the Trials of Osiris. The sequel reveals that Mercury had once been a garden world after the Traveler's terraforming, but the subsequent Vex invasion saw the world hollowed out and transformed into a massive computer housing the Infinite Forest. * In Mass Effect Mercury has several solar panels on the poles to collect and store energy. The player can also use the Planet Scanning feature in Mass Effect 2 to search for valuable metals used for crafting. * In Descent³, the player has to escort a covert cargo ship into and out of a spacecraft factory in Mercury while it steals core components for the construction of a new ship. The player risks solar radiation damage to his own ship (which is not as shielded as the cargo ship) if he flies out in the open atmosphere. * In the Mutant Chronicles role-playing game, Mercury is the home to the mighty Mishima corporation. However unlike the other planets Mercury was not fully Terraformed and so the population have to live in vast domed Cities. (This is stated in the First Series Sourcebook - Mishima) * The game Starsiege includes Mercury as the setting for several of its missions. * In the 1992 PC game Star Control II, Mercury is one of the sources of radioactive metals needed for the first mission of the game. * In Marvel Comics's Guardians of the Galaxy title, Nicholette \\"Nikki\\" Gold is the last survivor of a colony on Mercury in the 31st century after the Badoon invaded the Solar System.

For example, two separate people who witness a traffic accident, first hand, could be considered independent sources. However, if one person witnessed the accident and told the other one about it, then they would not be independent, since one would depend on the other for their information. Also, if two witnesses to an event discuss what they saw before they are consulted and agree on a consistent story, then they are also no longer independent. As another example, two scientific devices could be considered independent sources of measurement data, unless they shared the same wiring or electrical power supply (or similar factors). Consulting multiple independent sources is a common technique for detecting errors and deception, as any divergences or contradictions between statements, or data samples, would likely indicate one of these. The American judge Learned Hand declared that \\"Right conclusions are more likely to be gathered out of a multitude of tongues, than through any kind of authoritative selection. To many this is, and will always be, folly; but we have staked upon it our all.\\"United States v. Associated Press 1943. (As cited in the Oxford Dictionary of Political Quotations 4th ed. (2010) .) The New York Times's minimal standard for reporting a fact not otherwise attributed to a single speaker is that it be verified by at least two independent sources. Circular reporting is a situation where multiple sources appear to be independent, but in reality originate from a single source. Because circular reporting can happen inadvertently in many situations, extra care must be taken to ensure that multiple sources actually are independent, rather than interconnected in an obscure manner.

After touring in support of his previous album, Spectral Mornings (1979), Hackett took his band into Wessex Sound Studios to record a follow-up. Many Hackett fans consider this to be the last album from his classic solo period. The album remains Hackett's highest charting album on the UK Albums Chart, reaching No. 9. \\"The Show\\" was released as a single. In 2005, Defector was remastered and re-released on Virgin Records. The new edition features updated liner notes and five bonus tracks. A surround mix was included in the Premonitions: The Charisma Recordings 1975–1983 box set. Background By early 1980, Hackett had finished touring his previous album, Spectral Mornings (1979) which at the time of release, became his strongest selling album. Hackett wanted to capitalise on the commercial momentum he had achieved by rehearsing new material for a follow-up with his touring band prior to recording it in a studio. This way, he could finish it quickly and resume touring. Hackett found new sources of inspiration in his writing, specifically the 1970 political drama film The Conformist as a model for the imagery that he conjured in his mind and uses to write songs. He had spent Christmas of 1979 in Washington, D.C. which resulted in \\"more and more thoughts about less romantic things\\". \\"Slogans\\" reminded him of an out of control vehicle, and thought of \\"a mob feel; something run riot\\", futuristic, and propaganda themes. Though the album is a collection of songs, Hackett described its underlying theme: \\"There's a lot of heavy kind of claustrophobic kind of feelings from the idea of someone being trapped in a situation (in the broadest sense of the word) and having to move away to something else, somewhere else, somebody else... I see it more in terms of 'Defector' as a metaphor really and music as the supreme language of metaphor\\". Recording Defector was recorded in the spring of 1980 at Wessex Sound Studios in Highbury, north London. As the material was already rehearsed, Hackett noted that recording was quickly done, yet without cutting corners on the production as he had typically spent more time \\"getting things right\\" in the past. Following its release, Hackett had become increasingly aware of the musical direction of his past albums, and aimed for his next one to sound \\"less monumental\\". Release Defector reached No. 9 on the UK Albums Chart, and remains Hackett's highest charting album in the UK. \\"The Show\\" was released as a single. Hackett supported the album with a sell-out UK tour In additional, he performed for the first time as a solo artist in North America.

Members include Wú Hóngfēi (吴虹飞, vocals), Gěng Fàng (耿放, electric guitar), Lǐ Wéiyán (李维岩, electric guitar), Zhōu Qí (周琦, electric bass guitar), and Tián Kūn (田坤, drum set). Wu originally also played acoustic guitar in the group before deciding early on to focus strictly on vocals. The original bass player, Shèng (胜), was replaced by Jiǎng Róng (蒋荣) in June 2000, and Jiang was eventually replaced by Zhou. Wu Hongfei (surname Wu, b. 1975), Happy Avenue's vocalist and leader, is a graduate of Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University, with bachelor's degrees in environmental engineering and the editing of scientific books, and an M.A. degree in modern Chinese literature (although she primarily studied Western literature). Also the group's only female member, she has the distinction of being China's best known female rock singer. Originally from Sanjiang, in the southern Chinese province of Guangxi and a member of the Dong ethnic minority, Wu is also a magazine journalist and a published novelist. Her lyrics range from lighthearted, absurdist vignettes (like \\"The Orange Who Wished to Be an Apple\\") to darker and more melancholy meditations on subjects such as death, alienation, and longing. \\"Daughter\\" deals with the issues surrounding unwed motherhood. Some other songs feature literary subject matter; \\"The Fish Who Loved Xiaolong\\" tells the story of a mermaid who gives up her tail in order that she might be able to leave the sea and marry a human. The group's music is eclectic, and generally unclassifiable by genre, though occasionally somewhat reminiscent of such avant-garde groups as Talking Heads. Songs range from quirky, upbeat, and sardonic (\\"Daughter\\") to somber and brooding (\\"May\\"), the latter style leading some reviewers to describe the group's music as gothic. About the group, Wu says, \\"We never, ever let 'common taste' influence our music. We do what we like.\\" The group's melodies are catchy, with Wu's often pentatonic vocal melodies showing the influence of Chinese folk singing (leading the band to be described by some as a folk rock act). In some songs Wu's expansive melodies extend to the highest register of her voice in a manner reminiscent of opera, while others are rather lullaby-like (\\"Knife\\"). The group's albums often utilize vocal overdubbing to create an angelic choral effect. In a few songs (\\"Daughter\\") Wu sings in a more unorthodox manner, using abrupt sliding tones, whispering, and even screaming, displaying a wide range of emotions. Her often consciously edgy vocals, thus, contrast considerably with those of the sweeter and more formulaic styles of Mandopop and Cantopop singers such as Faye Wong or Teresa Teng. While Wu's youthful- sounding vocals often show the influence of Chinese traditional music, the musical background provided by the band is more or less based in straight- ahead rock, ranging from simple flatpicked lines to all-out rocking grooves, giving each song a musical character different from the others. Lead guitarist Geng utilizes a wide range of guitar effects, lending a wide variety of timbres to the group's sound. The group's demo, \\"Grain,\\" features Wu's voice with only a sensitive, classical-sounding acoustic guitar accompaniment. Like most rock bands in China, Happy Avenue is essentially an underground or cult group, whose audience consists largely of students and those of college age. The group generally plays in bars such as Beijing's CD Cafe and Get Lucky Bar, and has also performed in several other Chinese cities. Its first performance took place on May 1, 2000 at the Midi Modern Music Festival, sponsored by the Beijing Midi School of Music. Despite their consistent efforts, Happy Avenue's members have as yet found it impossible to reap financial rewards from their work, due in part to poor promotion of their music by their record labels, as well as due to current Chinese musical tastes. Happy Avenue released its first CD, A Fish in Xiao Long's Room, in 2004. During the recording of this album, Wu was writing her master's thesis, and, in order to complete the recording, postponed her graduation for a year. Their subsequent disc was released in 2005. Their track \\"Daughter\\" was included on the Beijing Band 2001: New Rock Bands from the People's Republic of China compilation CD, produced by American producer Matthew Corbin Clark. Due to Clark's efforts, Happy Avenue's music achieved recognition in the United States with the inclusion of their song \\"Daughter\\" in China in the Red (2003), a PBS Frontline television documentary about contemporary China. Wu has written candidly about her experiences with Happy Avenue in her semi-autobiographical novel The Double Life of Afei. She released a four-song solo EP in 2007.

Assigned to the Northern California Sector, and based at San Francisco, she patrolled on ocean weather stations, reporting weather conditions and acting as lifeguard ship beneath the trans-pacific air routes, until March 1946. Then ordered to the east coast, she departed California on the 13th and headed for Charleston, South Carolina, and inactivation. Decommissioned on 6 April 1946, she was sold to J. C.

Some cathode ray tubes, e.g., television picture tubes, include a thin layer of aluminium deposited on the back surface of their internal phosphor screen coating. Light from an excited area of the phosphor which would otherwise wastefully shine back into the tube is instead reflected forward through the phosphor coating, increasing the total visible light output. The aluminium layer must be thick enough to reflect light efficiently, yet not so thick as to absorb too great a proportion of the electron beam that excites the phosphor. Some projection screens have an aluminized surface, usually an aluminium paint rather than a solid sheet of the metal. They reflect polarized light without altering its polarization. This is necessary when showing 3D films as left-eye and right-eye views which are superimposed but oppositely polarized (typically at opposite 45 degree angles to the vertical if linearly polarized, right-handed and left-handed if circularly polarized).

It is referenced in a 1986 film of the same name by Eric Rohmer.  Plot summary  The heroes are trying to observe the green ray in Scotland. After numerous unsuccessful tries caused by clouds, flocks of birds or distant boat sails hiding the sun, the phenomenon is eventually visible, but the heroes, finding love in each other's eyes, don't pay attention to the horizon.  Scientific basis  Green flashes and green rays are rare optical phenomena that occur shortly after sunset or before sunrise, when a green spot is visible for a short period of time above the sun, or a green ray shoots up from the sunset point. It is usually observed from a low altitude where there is an unobstructed view of the horizon, such as on the ocean. The idea in the novel that one can predict where and when to observe the green ray has no scientific basis. However, they are regularly sighted by airplane pilots because they often can see the true horizon in mid flight, more often when flying west because the sun's relative motion is slightly slower. Cited in Eric Rohmer's 1986 film, the green ray is used as a central image providing meaning and guidance for the film's troubled main character, Delphine. Verne's book is discussed at length in the film as a \\"fairytale love story\\" whose protagonists are consumed in their search for the rare meteorological phenomenon. Believed to give a heightened perception to those who view it, one of the characters further explains that \\"when you see the green ray you can read your own feelings and others too.\\" Seizing this idea, Delphine uses her own search for the 'rayon vert' to help overcome her crippling fear of intimacy.

He has since made cameo appearances in several Hollywood productions and played other parts on television including the role of Todd Jaracki on The Beast with Patrick Swayze.

He acted in many plays and was a co-founder and active member of a student sketch comedy group called \\"The Kaktabulz.\\" Career Kastl on the set of \\"The Big Break All-Star Challenge\\" Kastl has made appearances in the blockbuster films Hulk and War of the Worlds. Kastl had a recurring role on Scrubs for 8 years from 2001 to 2009 as Dr. Doug Murphy, the totally incompetent doctor who finally finds his calling as a very competent forensic pathologist. However, he asked to be allowed to \\"sit out\\" the fourth season of Scrubs as he had broken both his heels in a ski jumping accident. This was written into the show to keep the character around and, as described on the DVD commentary by creator Bill Lawrence, \\"We felt that breaking both of his feet was a very \\"Doug\\" thing to do, so we decided to write it into the show.\\" He had a recurring role on Patrick Swayze's The Beast as FBI agent Todd Jaracki, friend of Ellis Dove (Travis Fimmel) for the 1 year it was on television. Personal life Prior to moving to Los Angeles, Johnny was employed as a Manager at Microsoft in Chicago, Illinois.

Arthur on August 3, 1882. It imposed a head tax on noncitizens of the United States who came to American ports and restricted certain classes of people from immigrating to America, including criminals, the insane, or \\"any person unable to take care of him or herself.\\" The act created what is recognized as the first federal immigration bureaucracy and laid the foundation for more regulations on immigration, such as the Immigration Act of 1891. Background Prior to the passage of the Immigration Act of 1882, the United States Congress had passed two significant acts regarding immigration. The first was the Page Act of 1875, which restricted the immigration of forced laborers coming from Asia. This had a major effect on the immigration of Asian indentured workers and women; specifically women presumed to be immigrating to work as prostitutes. The second was the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. This act halted all legal immigration of Chinese laborers and is considered by many to be the first major exclusionary immigration restriction on an entire nationality enacted by the United States. While both of these acts resulted from public fear of the Chinese influence in the labor market and the economy, they also derived from simple prejudice and the public perception of these immigrants' inability to assimilate into American culture. During the same time that America immigration was restricting Asian (specifically Chinese) immigration, many also criticized the influx of European immigrants – later referred to as the \\"Great Wave\\" – coming to the United States. As Europe's urban industrialization was changing the demographic landscape of life in many European cities, millions looked to immigrate in order to find opportunity in America. Calling it the \\"most massive of all human migrations to date,\\" scholar Otis. L. Graham reported that almost \\"27 million immigrants settled in the United States between 1880 and 1930\\".Roger Daniels and Otis L. Graham, Debating American Immigration, 1882-present (Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2001), 94. Furthermore, as explained in Debating American Immigration: 1882–Present, Roger Daniels explained how \\"great growth in the volume of immigration in the Gilded Age made some kind of organized administration necessary\\".Roger Daniels and Otis L. Graham, Debating American Immigration, 1882-present (Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2001), 14. This need and call for an \\"organized administration\\" would later be somewhat realized in the administrative outcomes of the Immigration Act of 1882. While the Immigration Act of 1882 shared the principle of immigration restriction with the two aforementioned acts, it was different in a fundamental way. Unlike the Chinese Exclusion act, the Immigration Act of 1882 would not limit all immigration from a certain country or region. Certain European immigrants were considered extremely desirable, so to limit by region would deny desirable immigrants as well. Instead, to limit immigration based on excluding certain kinds of people who were deemed \\"undesirable\\", there needed to be a piece of legislation capable of adhering to a more comprehensive, exclusionary approach that would be administered through a federal government agency with federal policy.  The Act  On August 3, 1882, the forty-seventh United States Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1882. It is considered by many to be \\"first general immigration law\\" due to the fact that it created the guidelines of exclusion through the creation of \\"a new category of inadmissible aliens.\\"Roger Daniels and Otis L. Graham, Debating American Immigration, 1882-present (Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2001), 13. There were two main components of the Immigration Act of 1882. The first was to create a \\"head tax\\" that would be imposed upon certain immigrants entering the country. The Act states that \\"There shall be levied, collected and paid a duty of fifty cents for each and every passenger not a citizen of the United States who shall come by steam or sail vessel from a foreign port to any port within the United States.\\" This money would be paid into the United States Treasury and \\"shall constitute a fund called the immigration fund.\\" These funds would be used to \\"defray the expense of regulating immigration under this act.\\" Scholar Roger Daniels commented that the head tax eventually \\"would rise, in stages, to eight dollars by 1917. In most years the government collected more in head taxes than it spent on administration.\\"Roger Daniels and Otis L. Graham, Debating American Immigration, 1882-present (Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2001), 13. The creation of such administration, and the need to collect and disburse the head taxes throughout the bureaucratic chain, led to the creation of \\"the first immigration bureaucracy.\\"Roger Daniels and Otis L. Graham, Debating American Immigration, 1882-present (Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2001), 13. It was a significant turning point of immigration policy in terms of relying on federal level legislation and administration. While this was not the first federal immigration law, as others were mentioned previously, states and local levels of immigration ports were mainly in control of immigration policy. The Immigration Act of 1882 was the beginning of the \\"contours of federal oversight\\" in immigration policy administration.Bromberg, Howard. \\"Immigration Act of 1882.\\" Immigration In America. N.p., n.d. Web. 27 Sept. 2013, 1. In addition to the head tax, the Act also stipulated the responsibility of government agents to inspect ports and vessels bringing immigrants into the country. This then led to the second historically significant component of the Act. Upon inquiry of the vessels transporting immigrants, immigration officials were given the authority to expel certain immigrants based on criteria laid out within the Act. The legislation dictated that \\"If on such examination there shall be found among such passengers any convict, lunatic, idiot, or any person unable to take care of him or herself without becoming a public charge, they shall report the same in writing to the collector of such port, and such person shall not be permitted to land.\\" Furthermore, if a criminal was found to be on board, it was the fiscal responsibility of the ship that brought the immigrant there to take them back out of the United States. The criminal provision of the act did not include immigrants who were \\"convicted of political offenses, reflecting the traditional American belief that the United States is a haven for those persecuted by foreign tyrants.\\"Bromberg, Howard. \\"Immigration Act of 1882.\\" Immigration In America. N.p., n.d. Web. 27 Sept. 2013, 2.  Legacy  One of the long-lasting legacies of this act is public charge doctrine. The act made those \\"likely to become a public charge\\" inadmissible to the United States and potentially deportable within 5 years of arrival. At the time, this status could be assigned to any number of people including pregnant or single women, the disabled, the sick, or the poor. Daniels commented that the \\"'LPC clause' originally only kept out persons who were obviously unable to support themselves, but in the twentieth century the executive branch broadened it, first to keep out poor Asian Indians and Mexicans and then to keep out poor people generally.\\" Roger Daniels and Otis L. Graham, Debating American Immigration, 1882-present (Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield, 2001), 14. The Immigration Act of 1882 was the first piece of immigration regulation to contain this kind of comprehensive subjective restriction, and it would continue on into contemporary conversations and debates regarding immigration.

Historical usage  Not all states gave their naval commanders such a title. Athens, for instance, placed its fleet under the command of generals (strategoi) holding the same title as those who commanded its land forces. Such command structures reflected the fact that, especially early in the Classical period, fleets operated in close conjunction with land forces, and indeed, the title of navarch did not begin to appear until the time of the Peloponnesian War, when fleets began to operate more independently. This separate title was originally used in cities that lacked an established naval tradition, Sparta being the most prominent, but entered broader use later, being adopted by the navies of the Hellenistic era states such as Macedon, Syracuse, Ptolemaic and Seleucid Empire, Achaean League, and Rhodes. At Sparta and many other city-states, the position was held for one year only (a situation that compelled the Spartans to resort to an elaborate legal fiction when they wished to reinstate Lysander for more than one year in command). Admirals of despotic or monarchic states, however, could serve for years at a time. At Sparta, the position, unlike most high-level offices, was available to men from outside the Spartiate class; Lysander, the most famous occupant of the office, was a beneficiary of this rule. The Latinisation ' was used by the Roman Navy for its squadron commanders. The Greek-speaking Byzantines sometimes used the term to designate the captains of ships; the terms drungarios or ' were used to designate their admirals.  Modern Greece  Rank flag of a .

All but one of the remaining flag ranks are also derivations of this word: (, \\"deputy-admiral\\") is the equivalent to vice admiral and (, \\"under-admiral\\"), equivalent to rear admiral, while is the equivalent of commodore. The same ranks are also used by the Hellenic Coast Guard. The rank of full is held in active service only by the Chief of the General Staff of National Defence, when he is a naval officer, and given to the Chiefs of the Hellenic Navy General Staff on retirement.

Bowen (after John James Audubon) Like other American black bear subspecies, cinnamon bears are omnivorous. Their diet includes fruit, vegetation, nuts, honey and occasionally insects and meat, varying from other subspecies because of regional habitat differences. Cubs weigh approximately at birth, with adults weighing between . The life span for this bear is a maximum of 30 years. Cinnamon bears are excellent climbers, good runners and powerful swimmers. They are mostly nocturnal, though they are sometimes active during daylight hours. The various color morphs are frequently intermixed in the same family; hence, it is a common occurrence to see, for example, either a black-colored female with brown or red-brown cubs, a brown-colored female with black or red- brown cubs, or a female of any one of the three colors with a black cub, a brown cub and a red-brown cub. The bears hibernate during the winter months, usually from late October or November to March or April, depending upon the weather conditions.[yellowstone/online Yellowstone] Their scat resembles that of domestic dogs.

An intersection just north of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue is designated \\"Johnny Grant Way\\". Early life and career Grant was born in Goldsboro, North Carolina. He made his show business debut on the radio in 1939 as a local newscaster there. According to publicity released by the third annual Hollywood Film Festival in 1999: Grant joined the Army Air Corps during World War II, hosting a daily radio show in New York City for servicemen and women. During this time, he interviewed many entertainment stars who were in the city. After his discharge, he stayed in New York, working as a reporter for station WINS. Having moved to California, Grant appeared as a disc jockey on Los Angeles area radio stations KGIL (1949–50) and KMPC (1951–59).Los Angeles Radio People, Where are They Now? - G, retrieved 2012-03-06 Along with Bing Crosby, Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra, Grant co-hosted the first national telethon ever produced, a fundraiser to help send America's athletes to the Helsinki Olympics in 1952. In the 1950s, he appeared in several films, often portraying uncredited fictional hosts. He played \\"Ed Harrison,\\" an Ed Sullivan-type TV-show host, in the 1954 film White Christmas, and the Master of Ceremonies in the 1956 film The Girl Can't Help It. Honorary Mayor of Hollywood Grant was named honorary Mayor of Hollywood in 1980 by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce and held the position for the rest of his life. Grant was recommended for the position by the previous mayor of Hollywood, Monty Hall, the host of the hit game show Let's Make a Deal. Grant was perhaps best known for having hosted the more than 500 celebrities he inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame with stars in the sidewalk. Grant claimed that his mission in life was bringing the Hollywood story to everyone. He played host to red-carpet arrivals at the Oscars, appeared in bit parts in movies and produced the annual Hollywood Christmas Parade. Grant also won two Emmy Awards. In this capacity, he appears in the documentary Confessions of a Superhero, complaining about people who dress as superheroes seeking tips on Hollywood Boulevard.Confessions of a Superhero, 2007 Accomplishments Grant served as a USO ambassador, joining the globe-trotting comedian Bob Hope in taking entertainers to war zones to perform for military personnel, and was the first recipient of the highest honor awarded by the USO, the United Service Organizations. Grant arranged for stars from Hollywood to visit wounded veterans of the Vietnam War at places such as San Antonio's Brooke Army Medical Center, including such actors as the late Christopher George.Photo Play Magazine, 'Chris George, George Morris and the Man Who Came Back from the Dead', page 59, April 1968 Grant was also a retired major general in the California State Military Reserve, a volunteer backup and support force of the California National Guard. He had been chairman of the Los Angeles City Fire Commission, the Los Angeles County Social Service Commission, and the Burbank, California Police Commission. More recently, he had been a member of the Los Angeles City Cultural Heritage Commission.

Grant was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame in 2009. Death On January 9, 2008, Grant was not feeling well when he had lunch with Ana Martínez-Holler, a spokeswoman for the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. Later that afternoon he relayed the same to his business manager, Jim Harper, stating he felt \\"lousy\\". Later that evening, Grant was found unconscious in his bed, in a 14th-floor suite he lived in at the Roosevelt Hotel, by an associate. He was the only full-time guest at the hotel. Paramedics were called, but Grant was eventually pronounced dead after they arrived, apparently of natural causes, at the age of 84. On January 11, 2008, Grant's sister, Peggy G. Adams of Goldsboro, North Carolina, announced that Johnny did not want a funeral service. Instead, there was a private memorial service held at the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood, California. Various publications reported that Grant wished for cremation, and for his ashes to be scattered under the Hollywood Sign. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has not set a timetable to name one or more persons to succeed Grant as mayor.Hollywood Chamber of Commerce statement Gary Owens was among those interested in the post, and he claimed that Grant tapped him as his successor.\\"Pin-Up Queen Turns Hollywood Mayor Race Pink\\" (NPR, 2008) However, Owens died in early 2015.

The Bhavani River flows from the Northwest around the mountain in a tight bend past Attappady village and continues to the Southeast. Geology Gneisses are the predominant rocks in Attappady. All rock types of Attappady other than supracrustals could be categorized into seven broad types. They are charnockite, hornblende gneiss, migmaititic amphibolite, quartz biotite gneiss, quartz-feldspathic gneiss, biotite granite gneiss, and pegmatite. Among the rock types charnockite, hornblende gneiss, migmatitic amphibolite, quartz biotite gneiss, quartz-feldspathic gneiss, and biotite granite gneiss have been identified that belong to the Peninsular Gneissic Complex. The granite and pegmatite of Attappad9 represent the post-kinematic intrusives. Many dolerite dykes also have been reported from this area. The bands and layers of ultramafics and mafic rocks (Ultramafic and mafic rocks represented by metapyroxinite, talc-tremolite-actinolite schist and amphibolites) of varying dimension, BIF, sillimamite/kyanite bearing quartzite and fuchsite quartzite occurring within the Peninsular Gneissic Complex of Attappady area designated as Attappady Supracrustals. Remnants and enclaves of Attappady supracrustals occur within the gneisses. BIF is another important rock type occurring in close association with the metapyroxinite and amphibolites. Attappady is unique in that a number of rock types varying in composition from ultramafic to metapelites occur as supracrustals. The metapelites are of granulite facies and the ultramafics are of greenschist facies and the enclosing gneisses represent amphibolites facies. The area had undergone polyphase deformation. The planar S0, is defined by the layering within chemogenic precipitate (BIF). The earliest folds F1, apart from being tight and appressed occur in intrafolial positions and also constitute the rootless folds. This folding has given rise to an axial planar penetrative foliation and is defined mainly by hornblende and to a lesser extend by chlorite and is co-parallel to the lithoboundaries identified as S0. S1 schistosity is defined by hornblende and chlorite, and this mineralogical association suggests that the deformation occurred under upper greenschist to lower amphibolite facies conditions. The subsequent F2 resulted in refolding of S1 and transposition of S1 subparallel to the F2 axial trace. The most prominent planar structures are the discrete mylonitic foliation S2 attributed the regional NE-SW trending Bhavani shear. Mylonite development, biotitization, chloritization and microgranulation are found associated with these surfaces.pradeepsz PhD thesis Genesis of gold mineralization in Attappady Gold Mineralization Mani 1965 reported the panning for gold by local miners in Siruvani River of Attappady. Detailed studies to assess the economic potential of Attappady area was carried out subsequently by Geological Survey of India. However, no primary gold prospects were identified. Nair 1993 carried out the geomorphologic mapping combined with panning of Siruvani River which led to the discovery of primary gold mineralization in epigenetic quartz vein in Puttumala. The veining, mineralization and associated lithology of this deposit appear to be typical of greenstone-hosted lode gold deposit. On the basis of mode of occurrence two types of gold mineralization are recognized in Attappady, #Primary gold mineralization is associated with quartz veins intruding to AS and PGC. #Placer deposit along the bank of Siruvani River. The Geological Survey of India has confirmed the high gold bearing potentiality of the rocks in the 834sq km area of the Attappady. Gold mineralization is known from Kottathara, Puttumala, Pothupadi, Mundaiyur and Kariyur-Vannathorai Prospects of Attappady. Gold occurs in quartz veins traversing in BIF, metavolcanics, and hornblende and biotite gneiss. Deccan Gold Mines Limited later confirmed the earlier reported gold grades and have given the following values, Kottathara prospect: Three zones have been delineated and the prospect has ore resource of grading 13.63g/t gold according to Geological survey of India. While tracing the NE extension of Kottathara prospect, stringers of quartz analyzing 9 g/t 35 g/t and 49g/t gold have been picked up in stream beds. *Puttumala prospect: A 60 cm sample of vein quartz carrying galena (lead sulfide) from old trenches showed high spot values of gold up to 21g/t. *Pothupadi Prospect: A sample of vein quartz traversing amphibolite assayed 4 g/t gold. *Mundaiyur Prospect: Gold occurs in quartz veins over a length of 300 m with gold-bearing sulphides enveloping the quartz veins. *Kariyur- Vannathorai Prospect: Samples of vein quartz have shown gold contents ranging from 3 to 20 g/t. In Attappady, region gold grains are found only in native state and occur in different shapes and sizes. Visible specks of gold were noticed in the samples collected from veins, particularly where the associated sulphides have been subjected to weathering and leaching resulting in the formation of limonite. Gold grains with maximum dimension of 2 mm were reported. Pyrite is the dominant sulfide phase within the quartz lodes (occurring as stringers and fracture fillings). Chalcopyrite, covellite, chalcocite, and galena are commonly observed in the mineral assemblage. Climate Attappady RF in the southwest portion of Mannarghat Forest Division receives a high rainfall of 4700 mm (185 in). Moving eastward along the Attappady valley towards Agali, the rainfall steadily decreases to a low of 900 mm.Asian Nature Conservation Foundation (2006) \\"NILAMBUR-SILENT VALLEY- COIMBATORE – PERSPECTIVE FOR THE RESERVE\\" retrieved 29 March 2007 PERSPECTIVE FOR THE RESERVE Population There are 192 hamlets in Attappady. Because of the inward migration of settlers from the mainland of Kerala, the tribal population of Attappady had decreased from around 90 percent in 1951 to around 40 percent only, by 2001.http://indianexpress.com/article/india/regional- india/survival-of-tribals-in-attappady-region-under-threat-as-infant-deaths- continue/ The tribal population of the valley is mostly Muduga, Irula, Kurumba tribal people and a section of settlers from Tamil Nadu and Other Districts of Kerala. There are mainly three Communities of tribes living in Attapadi they are irulas, Mudugas and kurumbas. =Kurumbas= (Kurumbar, Kurumban) Kurumbar are most primitive tribes. they are distributed in Attappady Block Panchayat of Palakkad District. They are the earliest inhabitants of Attappady area and are called ‘Palu Kurumba’ to distinguish them from the ‘Alu Kurumba’ of Nilgiris in Tamil Nadu State. The language spoken by them is a mixture of Tamil and Malayalam. The traditional social organisation of Kurumbar is similar to that of Mudugar and Irular communities residing in that area. Kurumbar mostly living in Reserve and Vested Forest areas have been practising shifting cultivation called ‘Panja Krishi’. They cultivate Ragi, Thuvara, Chama etc. They are experts in cattle rearing. They are also collectors of non timber forest produces. They maintain a community life by sharing land and labour. Kurumbas were once hunters and gatherers and shifting cultivators of Attappady Valley. However, among the five PVTG of Kerala, the younger generation of the Kurumba community have shown more interest than others in organising themselves and getting educated. Now they are living in 19 'ooru'. Kurumba community is settled in Agali and Pudur Grama Panchayats of Palakkad District. #Thadikund #Thazhe Anavai #Mele Anavai #Kadukamanna #Murukala #Palappada #kinattikkara #Thudukki #Mele Thudukki #Galazy #Kurukkathikkallu #Gottiyarkandi #Anakkattiyur #Pazhur #Mele Bhoothayar #Thazhe Bhoothayar #Idavani #Mele Moolakombu #Ooradam. There are 543 families with a population of 2251. The family size is 4.14. As the population consists of 1128 males and 1123 females the sex ratio is 1000:996. Ninety eight per cent of Kurumba population is settled in Pudur Grama Panchayat and the rest in Agali Grama Panchayat. =Mudugar= As already mentioned Mudugar distributed in Palakkad district, is one among the three communities of Attappady region. They have a distinct identity because of their traditional right to climb the Malleeswaran Peak and light the lamp on the ‘Sivaratri’ day. They have a dialect of their own known as ‘Muduga Bhasha’ Mudugar have the institutions of ‘Ooru Moopan’, (Headman)‘Bhandari’ (Treasurer), ‘Kuruthalai’ (Assistant) and ‘Mannukaran’ (soil expert). This system is similar to the traditional social organisation of the other two tribal communities of Attappady, viz; Irular and Kurumbar. Mudugar practise settled agriculture with many features of shifting cultivation. They used to cultivate ‘ragi’, ‘chama’, ‘thina’ etc. They also collect non timber forest produces. Their land has been alienated as they have little knowledge to secure documents relating to their possession. The working population among them has become agricultural laboures as agriculture and animal husbandary, have slowly been changing as their subsidiary occupations. The community is pro-educative and inputs to agriculture can sustain their livelihood means. There are 1274 families and 4668 population of Mudugar community. The population consists of 2225 males and 2443 females, registering the family size as 3.66 and sex ratio of 1000 : 1098. Mudugar community is settled in Palakkad District. In Pathanamthitta and Kannur Districts one family each of Mudugar community has been identified. Mudugar community is distributed in 9 Grama Panchayats in Palakkad but majority of them are settled in Agali and Pudur Grama Panchayats in Attappady region. =Irular, Irulan= Irular community is distributed in Palakkad District and they are mainly concentrated in Attappady region. They are also found in Tamil Nadu. They have a dialect of their own called ‘Irula bhasha’, which has more affinity to Tamil. Their traditional social organisation is endowed with various functionaries, namely; ‘Ooru Moopan’ (Chieftain),‘Bhandari’ (Treasurer), ‘Kuruthala’ (assistant to Chieftain) ‘Mannukaran’ (soil expert), ‘Marunnukaran’ (healer) etc. These positions are hereditary and succession is by the son. This traditional institutions play a decisive role in the social control mechanism of Irular community. Earlier Irular were hunters, gatherers and shifting cultivators. Now they have become experts in settled agriculture and also work as agricultural labourers. The major area in Attappady falls under rain shadow region and as such the important crops raised by them under dry farming are ‘Ragi’, ‘Chama’, ‘Thina’, ‘Cholam’, ‘Thuvara’, ‘Kadala’ etc. For cultivation they stay away from their hamlet and erect temporary huts. Irular community has attractive songs and dances which tell about their forest, cultivation, emotions etc. They have been empowered through ‘Thaikula Sangham’, exclusively for women and ‘Ooruvikasana Samithi’ organised under the Attappady Hills Area Development Society. Their livelihood means have been affected due to the influx of non tribal Scheduled Tribes of Kerala : Report on the Socio Economic Status Chapter 2 : Demographic Features of Scheduled Tribes 10 population both from other parts of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Technically, Irular community has representation in four districts, namely; Palakkad, Thiruvananthapuram, Idukki and Malappuram. There are 7617 families of Irular community, of which 7614 are in Palakkad District and one each in the other three districts. The family size of Irular community is 3.48 Irular population comes to 26,525. They have the credit of being the fifth largest community of Scheduled Tribes in Kerala. They constitute 6.22 per cent of the Scheduled Tribes. In Palakkad they are settled in 10 Grama Panchayats, with the concentration in the 3 Grama Panchayats of Attappady region. Approximately 95.20 per cent of Irular community is located in Agali (9474), Sholayur (9076) and Pudur (6703) Grama Panchayats of Attappady. Pudussery (907) and Malampuzha (245) are the other two Grama Panchayats with a sizable population of Irular community. Since the population consists of 13163 males and 13362 females, the sex ratio of Irular community is 1000 : 1015. Infrastructure The local governments of Attappady are the Agali, Pudur and Sholayur Grama Panchayats. =Health= There are three government primary health centres (PHC), one community health centre (CHC) and 28 subcentres in this 745-km² block. All hamlets are serviced by an effective government health extension program using trained tribal health volunteers.COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH PROJECT PDF file The best equipped charitable multi speciality hospital in the region is being run by Swami Vivekananda Medical Mission at Agaly. It is a 30 bed hospital with all advance diagnostics and basic surgery facilities, ICU, neo natal care etc. and all major disciplines such as gynecology & obstetrics, pediatric, skin, dental, ENT etc. The hospital charges a very nominal fee from non tribal patients which is a fraction of the commercial market rates. For tribal patients, all treatments whether out patient or in patient, procedures, tests, medicines, everything is for free. Investments in infrastructure are basically met by corporate social responsibility (CSR) support from companies. The operating expenses under charitable activities are funded through crowd funding as well as through donations from philanthropists, well wishers etc. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SVMM_Hospital.jpg The tribal women of 80 Attapadi hamlets are conducting a vocal campaign against liquor and ganja which has received public support from the Governor.Hindustan times, Kerala, ( 21 March 2007) \\"Kalam starts Attapadi anti-liquor campaign\\", retrieved 21 April 2007 Attapadi anti-liquor campaign The Society of the Missionaries of St. Thomas operates the St. Thomas Ashram in Nelippathy for providing services to the tribal people of Attapadi including a 15-bed Hospital and health clinic with Lab, X-ray, Dental X-ray, ECG, Pharmacy and ambulance. =Education= Only one government school in Agali is having the facilities of a full equipped education centre. A college of applied sciences (IHRD College) is started in Agali, in the year 2010 for the higher education. Govt. College Attappady is the first Arts and science College in the Attappady region established under the Govt. sector in 2012. Since 2010, Swami Vivekananda Medical Mission has been running an English medium high school with classes up to Std 10 under affiliation from National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS). The school operates under the management guidance of Bharatheeya Vidya Nikethan, Kerala. The school has 300+ students, a third of them tribals. Education is completely free for tribal students and non tribals from poor background. The school operates from a 3 acre picturesque property, has 10 class rooms,well equipped library, laboratory, spacious playground and a perennial water stream adjacent to it. Malleeswara Vidya Nikethan Development projects In 1970 the State Planning Board assessed Attappati as the most backward block in the state and the first Integrated Tribal Development Project in Kerala was initiated there. Since then, the state government has implemented several special development projects including the Attappady Co-operative Farming Society, the Western Ghats Development Programme, the Attappady Valley Irrigation Programme and the People's Planning Programme implemented in Attappady in 1997–2002. A monumental palace-like \\"Bharat Yatra Centre\\" at Agali was established in 1984 by a former Prime Minister, Chandra Shekhar, to provide employment training in weaving, pottery, embroidery and food processing to the women of this rural area. The property was occasionally occupied personally by Chandra Shekar but employment training never happened. The leaders of Girijan Sevak Samaj (GSS), the major tribal body in Attappady, stated that the center was built on original tribal lands possessed illegally. In 2000 The Centre at Attappady and its huge building were deserted and unoccupied.Interdisciplinary Biannual Journal PDF file Many of these projects were not well adapted to traditional adivasi culture and beliefs so about 80 per cent of the tribal population is still living in abject poverty. Attappady demonstrates how difficult it is for a modern government development process to succeed in a traditional self-sustaining indigenous peoples (adivasi) community. Tribal people are a majority of the Attappady population but have a high illiteracy rate of 49.5 per cent and a lack of political and administrative awareness. The majority of project managers and new land owners are from other parts of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and other states. Attappady Hills Area Development Society (AHADS) The Attappady Comprehensive Environmental Conservation and Wasteland Development Project was established in 1995, with local operations managed from their Agali Headquarters. This project has Rs. 2.19 billion ($5,000,000) development assistance loan from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and is implemented by the Attappady Hills Area Development Society.AHADS index a state government agency.

Integrated Rural Technology Centre (IRTC), Palakkad is implementing the NABARD WADI Tribal development project in Attappady. In 2004, Swami Vivekananda Medical Mission (SVMM), a charitable trust registered in Agaly Village started functioning in Attappady. SVMM was founded by Dr V Narayanan, MBBS, DCH from Govt Medical College, Trivandrum as a charitable institution devoted to selfless service of tribal communities. SVMM started its work as a mobile medical unit dispensing medicines to tribal hamlets. It has since grown into a comprehensive service organisation with the following components: (i) a 30 bed multi specialty hospital in Agaly that provides free in patient and out patient medical treatment to tribals free of cost Swami Vivekananda Medical Mission Hospital, Agaly (ii) an English medium school affiliated to National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) that provides free education to tribals up to Std 10 (iii) a skill development center for tribals named as Sri Balachandran Smaraka Janavaibhava Kendram that runs skill development and micro entrepreneurship development programs in collaboration with Dept of MSME, Govt of India, NABARD etc. (iv) community outreach programs such as deploying trained Village Health Workers in all tribal hamlets, awareness campaigns, free health camps, immunization drives, mental health programs, alcohol de-addiction drives, sickle cell anemia program, etc. (v) empowerment program for tribals such as Saraswati Samskruti Kendras where sanskars are inculcated in children, Grama Samitis for developing problem solving skills, Farmers Committees where sustainable agriculture and new technological innovations are introduced. In a span of 15 years, SVMM has been able to bring about a remarkable change in the social health backed by grass roots empowerment and sense of belonging in tribal communities. Attappady Social Service Organisation (ASSO) is one of the major Social Service Organization functioning in Attappady. It successfully implemented World Bank aided 'Jalanidhi' project to provide drinking water facility for the tribal community. Festival The Sivarathri festival is celebrated at the chemmannur Malleswaran temple by the tribals during the month of February/March. The Malleswaran peak is worshipped as a gigantic Shivalinga by the adivasis who celebrate the Sivarathri festival there with great fervour. At the Ayyappan temple in Agali, Ayyappan Vilakku is celebrated in January. The Vishu festival is celebrated at Pattimalam in Sree Vandikotti Mariyamma Thune Temple.

It is referred to in the song \\"The River\\" by Chely Wright. La Cygne, Kansas in Linn County and Osawatomie, Kansas in Miami County are gravely affected by its flooding. Course The Marais des Cygnes is formed about 1 mile north of Reading, Kansas, a city in northern Lyon County, by the confluence of Elm Creek and One Hundred Forty-Two Mile Creek, and flows generally east-southeastwardly through Osage, Franklin, Miami and Linn counties in Kansas, and Bates County in Missouri, past the Kansas towns of Melvern, Quenemo, Ottawa, Osawatomie and La Cygne and through the Marais des Cygnes National Wildlife Refuge. In Missouri, it joins the Little Osage River at the boundary of Bates and Vernon counties to form the Osage River, west of Schell City. In Osage County, Kansas, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dam causes the river to form Melvern Lake, which is the site of Eisenhower State Park.

The nameplate would be used on successive downsizings, first in 1980, and again in 1982, through what would originally have been intermediate and compact classes in the early 1970s, all with conventional rear-wheel drive layouts. By the time Chrysler ended M-body production in December 1988 (1989 model year), they were Chrysler's last remaining rear-wheel drive cars, with a V8 and carburetor, a configuration used since the mid-1950s. Plymouth did not have another rear-wheel drive car until the 1997 Prowler roadster. After Chevrolet ended production of its full- sized Caprice sedan in 1996, Ford continued production of its V8 powered rear- wheel drive Panther platform models through September 2011. In 2013, GM announced the end of Zeta platform manufacturing in Australia by 2017. At the end of 2001, the Plymouth nameplate had been discontinued, but in 2005, Chrysler's 300 and Dodge Magnum, as well as the 2006 Charger and 2008 Challenger, brought full-sized V6 and V8 powered rear- (and all-wheel-drive) sedans back to their lineup, thereby leaving Fiat Chrysler Automobiles as the only American manufacturer of full-sized V8/RWD passenger sedans. Before 1975, the top line models in Plymouth's Fury series were known as the \\"Fury Gran Coupe\\" and \\"Fury Gran Sedan\\". The Fury Gran Coupe model was introduced in 1970 as a highly trimmed pillared coupe. It moved to the two-door hardtop body for 1971, when a \\"Fury Gran Coupe\\" hardtop sedan was also available, renamed \\"Fury Gran Sedan\\" for 1972. The Gran Coupe and Gran Sedan models continued in 1973. 1975–1977 In 1975, the mid-size B-body Plymouth Satellite was restyled and renamed Plymouth Fury. As a result, the previous full-sized C-body Fury became known as the Gran Fury. Because the C-body Fury had been redesigned for 1974, the 1975 Gran Fury received few changes besides its new name. Top-of-the-line Gran Fury Brougham models were treated to a new grille and new single-unit headlight design; all Gran Furys would receive this for 1976. 1975 Gran Fury Brougham 2-door coupe 1975 Gran Fury Custom Suburban station wagon 1977 Gran Fury Brougham 2-door hardtop 1977 Gran Fury 4-door sedan This generation was available as a 2-door coupe, 2-door hardtop, 4-door sedan, 4-door hardtop, and 4-door station wagon. All models with the exception of the wagons rode on the wheelbase shared with the Dodge Monaco. Gran Fury Suburban wagons rode on a longer wheelbase that was also used by Monaco wagons and all full-sized Chryslers and Imperials. The 1975 Gran Fury was available in four trim levels:Encyclopedia of American Cars \\"Plymouth\\" p.717: \\"Plymouth Production Figures.\\" base (sedan and coupe only), \\"Custom\\" (all models), \\"Brougham\\" (coupe and hardtop only), and \\"Sport Suburban\\" (wagon only). Changes for 1976 were minimal. The 4-door hardtop body style was eliminated, leaving only coupes, sedans, and wagons. With this, sedans were now available in deluxe Brougham trim. Offerings were trimmed for the C-body Gran Fury's final model year, 1977. The mid-range Custom trim level was dropped, leaving only base and high-end Brougham coupes and sedans. 1977 Gran Fury wagons were available in either base Suburban or high-end Sport Suburban models. All full-sized C-body Plymouths were discontinued at the end of the 1977 model year, leaving the mid-size B-body Fury to soldier on as Plymouth's large car for 1978. Sales of all of the Chrysler Corporation's C-body models for the 1974-1978 model years were considerably disappointing; the Plymouth Gran Fury was no exception. This is because 1973 introduction of the redesigned 1974 model year C-bodies coincided with the 1973 oil crisis. As gas prices skyrocketed, demand for gas- guzzling full-sized cars took a nosedive. C-body offerings decreased throughout the 1974-1978 design cycle. Imperials were the first to go after 1975. Plymouth and Dodge C-bodies were dropped after the 1977 model year. Chrysler C-bodies were discontinued after 1978. The discontinuation of the Gran Fury was followed by the discontinuation of the mid-size Fury after the 1978 model year. This huge gap in Plymouth's lineup left the compact Volaré as Plymouth's largest car for 1979. A redesigned downsized Gran Fury would return in 1980. { class=wikitable +Production figuresThe Encyclopedia of American Cars, 2006 Edition - ! Year !

Total production  159,864 } 1980–1981 When the downsized \\"R-body\\" cars were introduced for 1979, a Plymouth version was not included, as the low-end Chrysler Newport was intended to fill this gap. Although the Newport achieved this, and 1979 sales were fairly strong, there was still heavy demand for a full-sized Plymouth model.\\"Chrysler Corporation R Bodies: 1979-1981 Downsized, Full-Sized Cars\\" Information courtesy of Chrysler, allpar, retrieved on 2010–07–01. So finally in 1980 the Gran Fury returned after a two-model-year absence. This downsized Gran Fury was available only as a \\"pillared hardtop\\" 4-door sedan, this time based on the heavily restyled, but not re-engineered R platform, introduced in 1979 in response to redesigned Chevrolet and Ford models. The \\"new\\" R-body was heavily based on Chrysler's old mid-size B-body platform, introduced in 1962 and updated several times thereafter. Nearly identical to the concurrent Chrysler Newport, it was intended to satisfy dealer requests for a lower-priced full-size model but more importantly to fulfill fleet orders, primarily for police and taxi use. The 1980 Plymouth Gran Fury was available in two versions, Base and Salon. Gran Fury Salon offered more standard features, including a vinyl-covered roof, higher-grade interior cloth, split-bench seat, chrome body-side trim, and deluxe wheel covers. Like its sibling, the Dodge St. Regis, the R-Body Gran Fury was very popular with fleet customers, especially police departments (by ordering the A38 Police Package coupled with a 195 bhp E58 360 cu in engine); both the Michigan State Police and the Ohio State Highway Patrol ordered substantial numbers of the cars. In light of this, the 1980 Gran Fury achieved the highest sales (18,750) of any R-body that year.Encyclopedia of American Cars, 2006 Edition p.278; 362; 717: \\"Plymouth Production Figures.\\" The 2nd Generation Plymouth Gran Fury was short-lived, being discontinued midway through the 1981 model year, along with the other R-body models, due to slow sales. This can be mainly attributed to poor fuel economy, as well as its outdated platform. The 1981 Gran Fury was also the last true full-size car to bear the Plymouth name, until the brand's demise twenty years later. { class=wikitable +Production figures /> - ! Year !

Total production  22,319 } 1982–1989 In 1982, Plymouth downsized the Gran Fury again, this time sharing the mid- size M platform with the Chrysler Fifth Avenue (called Chrysler New Yorker/New Yorker Fifth Avenue for 1982 and 1983) and the Dodge Diplomat. In addition to the R-body Gran Fury, the M-body Gran Fury replaced the M-body Chrysler LeBaron, which had moved to the compact K platform that year. Now considered a mid-sized car, this generation Gran Fury was close to the exterior size of what was once the compact Valiant and Volaré but offered more interior room. The M-body was in fact heavily based on the Volaré's F platform. Like its predecessor, the 1982 Gran Fury was introduced later than its Chrysler and Dodge siblings; the Chrysler LeBaron and Dodge Diplomat had used the M-body since 1977. 1982-1989 Plymouth Gran Fury shared the Dodge Diplomat's front and rear fascias. They were virtually identical with the exception of badging. Once again, the third generation Gran Fury was available in base and higher- end \\"Salon\\" trim. As in previous years, the higher-volume Gran Fury base model catered more towards fleet customers while Gran Fury Salons were geared more towards private customers and offered options such as full vinyl roofs, velour upholstery, turbine-spoke wheels, power windows, and power locks. Although available to retail buyers, Gran Fury was far more popular with police departments and other fleet buyers, primarily since the car was reasonably priced and had a conventional drive-train with proven components that could withstand a good deal of abuse. The Gran Fury, however, was much less powerful than both its Big Three competitors as well as the Chrysler Corporation's earlier police offerings. The most powerful engine available to police departments was a iteration of the 318 ci V8, capable of an 18.16 second quartermile in period testing - slower than the 90-hp Volkswagen Rabbit GTi. This generation of the Gran Fury sold in respectable numbers. However, despite having the same base prices as the Gran Fury (just under $12,000 USD for their final year), the Diplomat always outsold it, usually by several thousand units each year. The Chrysler Fifth Avenue's total sales were always more than that of the Gran Fury and Diplomat by far, even though it generally cost about $6,000 USD more. This last car to carry the Gran Fury nameplate remained largely unchanged for its 7-year run. Declining sales, a lack of promotion, and technical obsolescence—the platform dated back to the 1976 Plymouth Volare and Dodge Aspen—eventually contributed to the model's demise in early 1989. That year, a driver-side airbag became standard; this would be the last RWD Plymouth until the introduction of the Prowler. While Dodge offered the 1990 Monaco, and later the 1993 Intrepid, Chrysler never replaced the Gran Fury with any other large car in the remainder of Plymouth's lineup on through to its demise in the 2001 model year. { class=wikitable +Production figures - !

Application areas include image scaling and audio/visual systems, where different sampling rates may be used for engineering, economic, or historical reasons. For example, Compact Disc Digital Audio and Digital Audio Tape systems use different sampling rates, and American television, European television, and movies all use different frame rates. Sample-rate conversion prevents changes in speed and pitch that would otherwise occur when transferring recorded material between such systems. Within specific domains or for specific conversions, the following alternative terms for sample-rate conversion are also used: sampling-frequency conversion, resampling, upsampling, downsampling, interpolation, decimation, upscaling, downscaling. The term multi-rate digital signal processing is sometimes used to refer to systems that incorporate sample-rate conversion.  Techniques  Conceptual approaches to sample-rate conversion include: converting to an analog continuous signal, then re-sampling at the new rate, or calculating the values of the new samples directly from the old samples. The latter approach is more satisfactory, since it introduces less noise and distortion. Two possible implementation methods are as follows: # If the ratio of the two sample rates is (or can be approximated by) a fixed rational number L/M: generate an intermediate signal by inserting L − 1 0s between each of the original samples. Low-pass filter this signal at half of the lower of the two rates. Select every M-th sample from the filtered output, to obtain the result. # Treat the samples as geometric points and create any needed new points by interpolation. Choosing an interpolation method is a trade-off between implementation complexity and conversion quality (according to application requirements). Commonly used are: ZOH (for film/video frames), cubic (for image processing) and windowed sinc function (for audio). The two methods are mathematically identical: picking an interpolation function in the second scheme is equivalent to picking the impulse response of the filter in the first scheme. Linear interpolation is equivalent to a triangular impulse response; windowed sinc approximates a brick-wall filter (it approaches the desirable \\"brick wall\\" filter as the number of points increase). The length of the impulse response of the filter in method 1 corresponds to the number of points used in interpolation in method 2. In method 1, a slow pre-computation (such as the Remez algorithm) can be used to obtain an optimal (per application requirements) filter design. Method 2 will work in more general cases, e.g. where the ratio of sample rates is not rational, or two real-time streams must be accommodated, or the sample rates are time-varying. See decimation and upsampling for further information on sample-rate conversion filter design/implementation.  Examples  = Film and television = The slow-scan TV signals from the Apollo moon missions were converted to the conventional TV rates for the viewers at home. Digital interpolation schemes were not practical at that time, so analog conversion was used. This was based on a TV rate camera viewing a monitor displaying the Apollo slow-scan images. Movies (shot at 24 frames per second) are converted to television (roughly 50 or 60 fields per second). To convert a 24 frame/sec movie to 60 field/sec television, for example, alternate movie frames are shown 2 and 3 times, respectively. For 50 Hz systems such as PAL each frame is shown twice. Since 50 is not exactly 2×24, the movie will run 50/48 = 4% faster, and the audio pitch will be 4% higher, an effect known as PAL speed-up. This is often accepted for simplicity, but more complex methods are possible that preserve the running time and pitch. Every twelfth frame can be repeated 3 times rather than twice, or digital interpolation (see above) can be used in a video scaler. = Audio = Audio on Compact Disc has a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz; to transfer it to a digital medium that uses 48 kHz, method 1 above can be used with L = 160, M = 147 (since 48000/44100 = 160/147). For the reverse conversion, the values of L and M are swapped. Per above, in both cases, the low-pass filter should be set to 22.05 kHz.

He is a second generation wrestler, being the son of his trainer Ivan Putski, alongside whom he has wrestled on several occasions.  Professional wrestling career  = Early career (1986–1991) = After attending college at Texas Christian University, where he played football as a running back, Bednarski trained under his father Ivan to become a professional wrestler and eventually debuted in 1986 in Texas All Star Wrestling where he teamed up with his father Ivan. In June 1988, he appeared with Jim Crockett promotions. In May 1991 he had a tryout match for the World Wrestling Federation, defeating The Brooklyn Brawler, but was not hired. = Global Wrestling Federation (1991–1992) = In late 1991, Putski joined the Dallas-based Global Wrestling Federation. On March 20, Putski and Terry Simms captured the Tag Team Championship from the Coast to Coast Connection (\\"Hollywood\\" John Tatum and \\"California Studd\\" Rod Price). Less than a month later, on April 17, the belts were held up following a match between Putski and Simms and the Goodfellows (Gary Young and Steven Dane). Young and Dane would go on to win the rematch on May 1 and become the undisputed champions. On May 29, he defeated Johnny Mantell in a tournament final to capture the North American Heavyweight Championship, the federation's top singles title, which had been declared vacant after \\"Hot Stuff\\" Eddie Gilbert left the GWF for the Memphis-based United States Wrestling Association. Putski would hold the title until being fired in August. =World Wrestling Federation (1993, 1994)= Putski appeared in the WWF again in early 1993, winning dark matches at the January 4 and 5 television tapings, but once again made no further appearances until a Madison Square Garden house show on January 17, 1994. He defeated Iron Mike Sharpe in the opening match and then returned in the main event, a 30-man Royal Rumble match, lasting about 12 minutes before being eliminated by Headshrinker Fatu. =Return to WWF (1997)= After several tours in Japan and Mexico, the latter of which included the loss of his mask as Konnan 2000 to Rubén Púas Olivares on May 8, 1993, Putski returned to the WWF in 1997 on the May 12 episode of their show Raw, where he defeated Leif Cassidy. Soon after debuting, he began a short feud with fellow light heavyweight Brian Christopher and even teamed up with his father Ivan to defeat Christopher and his father, Jerry Lawler, on the July 14 episode of Raw. After the feud, Putski collected a number of victories against enhancement talents, before he lost to Christopher via injury, making the referee call for the bell at the pay-per-view Ground Zero: In Your House on September 7. Putski left the company shortly afterwards. =World Championship Wrestling (1998)= After a brief hiatus, Putski joined World Championship Wrestling and debuted for the company on the May 4 episode of Monday Nitro, where he wrestled to a no contest against Kidman. On the July 6 episode of Nitro, he defeated Scotty Riggs to claim his first victory. Putski wrestled against World Television Champion Chris Jericho, but was unable to win the title. He then left the company in late 1999. =Retirement (2003–2013)= After a four-year-long hiatus, Putski debuted for the Arlington-based Professional Championship Wrestling on May 31, 2003. While in PCW, he and Cedric Crain formed a tag team called the \\"Cowboys From Hell\\". Soon after their formation, the Cowboys won the Tag Team Championship. On July 26, Putski wrestled his final match as he and Crain gave the belts to Apocalypse and Tim Storm. =Return to wrestling (2013–present)= After a decade in retirement, Putski returned to the ring for the National Wrestling Alliance for their Ark-La-Tex promotion that spread throughout Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas.

Inspired by Schultz' family, this Contemporary Christian / Pop song released in 2003 along with its music video and has won several awards. Background Mark Schultz stated that the song was written in honor of his Great-Grandmother's sons. All 3 of the boys went to fight in World War II. Her 2 older boys came home a short time later but her youngest son was there until the end of the war. The song itself tells of a young man going off to fight in a war. His mother writes daily, and he writes back. One day in December, she gets a letter from a fellow soldier that her son was captured by the enemy while saving him. The mother keeps writing anyway, and two years later, a black car pulls into her driveway, and she faints. Her son steps out, now a Captain. He runs to her, and tells her he's followed her orders of coming home. He has all of her letters in his hand while he's hugging her, and the video ends with the other soldiers being reunited with their families. Music video A music video for the song was filmed in rural Georgia in 2004. The video features Blake Michael (host of Cartoon Network's Fried Dynamite) at age 7 portraying the soldier as a young boy. The video was directed by Marc Dobiecki. The video also won The 2003-2004 Department of Defense Visual Information Production Award for the U.S. Army Combat Readiness Center (CRC). Reception The song was the #1 song on American Armed Forces Radio in 2004 and was performed for George W. Bush during the summer of the same year.

Sonnier was sentenced to death - with his younger brother, Eddie, sentenced to life in prison - on April 25, 1978, for the November 5, 1977, rape and murder of Loretta Ann Bourque, 18, and the murder of David LeBlanc, 17. Sister Helen Prejean was asked to write to death row inmates as part of her Order's community outreach program and wrote to Sonnier. She became his spiritual adviser and eventually wrote Dead Man Walking (1993) about her experience and her belief that the death penalty was morally wrong. Crime On November 4, 1977, 17-year-old David LeBlanc and his girlfriend 18-year-old Loretta Ann Bourque attended the Homecoming football game at Catholic High School in Iberia Parish, Louisiana. After the game, the couple drove to an isolated area in St. Martin Parish, a type of lovers' lane. At around 1 a.m., the couple were approached by two men, 27-year-old Elmo Patrick \\"Pat\\" Sonnier and his younger brother, 20-year-old Eddie James Sonnier. The brothers had been in the area hunting rabbits and were armed with 22-caliber rifles. The Sonniers identified themselves as police officers and presented a badge that one of the brothers had acquired while working as a security guard. The brothers entered LeBlanc's car. They told the couple that they were trespassing on private property and were under arrest. The brothers took LeBlanc's and Bourque's driver's licenses, handcuffed the couple, and moved them to the back seat. They then told the couple that they were going to drive them to the home of land's owner to see if the owner wished to press trespassing charges. The Sonniers drove the couple to an oilfield in Iberia Parish and parked by the road. They handcuffed LeBlanc to a tree in a nearby wooded area. They took Bourque from the car and Elmo raped her. The brothers told her they would release both her and LeBlanc unharmed if she had sex with Eddie James Sonnier. Bourque agreed. Afterward, the brothers took the couple back to the car and removed their handcuffs. Elmo Sonnier decided against releasing them, as he feared the couple would report the incident and he would be reincarcerated at Angola. The brothers forced the couple to lie face down in a ditch and fatally shot them several times. The brothers returned LeBlanc's car to St. Martin Parish. When they reached Elmo's 1961 Dodge Dart, they discovered they had a flat tire. They used a jack from LeBlanc's car to change their tire. The jack was later found in Elmo Sonnier's car. The following day, the brothers disposed of LeBlanc's and Bourque's driver's licenses and buried the weapons they used in the killings. Arrests The Sonnier brothers were arrested on December 5, 1977. Elmo voluntarily confessed to police that he abducted LeBlanc and Bourque, raped Bourque, and killed both. He made a second statement admitting his guilt while being transported to jail, and a third confession the following day. Police searched his home, where they found handcuffs in his bedroom that had been used to restrain LeBlanc and Bourque. They also found LeBlanc's car jack in Elmo's car. Later they discovered the buried guns that had been used in the murders. A bullet from one of the victims matched the guns, which belonged to the Sonnier brothers; another match was made from casings found at the crime scene. Police located a witness who saw Elmo Sonnier's car in St. Martin Parish. Both brothers were indicted on two counts of first degree murder. Elmo Sonnier entered a plea of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. Trial and conviction During the trial, the brothers traded accusations as to who did the killings (under Louisiana law, any person who participates in the killing of another human being may be subject to the death penalty, but the extent of participation may be considered when imposing penalty). They were said to have been under the influence of drugs when they committed the crimes. In April 1978, Elmo was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. Eddie Sonnier was also found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to death. After their first appeal, the court reversed their death sentences due to procedural errors. New sentencing hearings were scheduled. During his brother's second penalty hearing, Eddie James Sonnier recanted his previous testimony, claiming that he was responsible for the killings, not his brother. He also sent a letter to Governor Edwin W. Edwards asserting the same position. The prosecution attacked the younger brother's credibility, establishing Elmo Sonnier's lead in the crimes and responsibility for the murders. The state of Louisiana again sentenced Elmo to death. Eddie Sonnier was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole because he was a minor at the time of the crime. Imprisonment While on death row at Louisiana State Prison, Elmo Sonnier was contacted by an outreach effort setting up communication with inmates on Death Row. Sister Helen Prejean, a Catholic nun, was assigned to him. After they started a correspondence, she began to visit him and became his spiritual adviser. He was the first of many death row inmates whom she counseled. Sr. Prejean subsequently became a nationally prominent anti-death penalty activist. Sister Helen Prejean later said that the younger brother, Eddie Sonnier, was guilty of killing LeBlanc and Bourque. She claimed that Elmo was innocent but he felt guilt over his criminal past and for participating in the rape of not only Bourque, but other teenage girls at \\"lover's lane\\", who had come with their boyfriends. The two brothers had frequently posed as police officers and accosted such couples. They offered to let them go if the girl had sex with both brothers. Elmo told Prejean that he and his brother had pulled the same ruse the night they encountered LeBlanc and Bourque, but his brother lost control and killed the teens. Execution and burial Louisiana State Penitentiary, where Sonnier was imprisoned and executed Sonnier's execution date was set for April 5, 1984. On April 4, Sonnier's lawyer attempted to get a stay of execution from the United States Supreme Court, claiming that a former cellmate of Eddie Sonnier's had overheard him confess to the murders. The Supreme Court rejected the request. Sister Helen Prejean, Elmo Sonnier's spiritual adviser, was permitted to visit with Sonnier during his final hours and to witness his execution. Godfrey Bourque and Lloyd LeBlanc, the fathers of Loretta Bourque and David LeBlanc, respectively, were also granted permission to witness the execution. In the execution chamber, Sonnier directed his last statement to Lloyd LeBlanc, saying \\"I can understand the way you feel. I have no hatred in my heart. As I leave this world, I ask God to forgive...me for what I did. I also ask your forgiveness for what I did.\\" LeBlanc nodded, and then Bourque remarked quietly \\"He didn't ask me.\\" Sonnier was strapped in what was known as \\"Gruesome Gertie\\", the state's oak electric chair. After electrical currents were administered, Elmo Patrick Sonnier was pronounced dead at 12:15 a.m. Sr. Prejean and other Catholic nuns took responsibility to ensure a proper Catholic burial for Elmo Sonnier. The service, presided over by the bishop of Baton Rouge, Stanley Joseph Ott, was held at a Baton Rouge-area funeral home. Sonnier was buried in Roselawn Memorial Park, in a burial plot normally reserved for nuns. Eddie James Sonnier died in December 2013 at the age of 57, after a short illness, at Louisiana State Prison. He is buried in the prison cemetery. In popular culture Sister Helen Prejean published a book, Dead Man Walking (1993), about her relationship with Elmo Sonnier and Robert Lee Willie, another inmate on Death Row whom she counseled. The book was adapted as a 1995 film of the same name directed by Tim Robbins and starring Susan Sarandon as Sister Prejean and Sean Penn as Matthew Poncelet, an amalgam of Sonnier and Willie. Her book was also adapted as an opera of the same name, first produced in 2000 by the San Francisco Opera.

This is a list of number-one songs as recorded by IRMA’s Top 50 Singles chart -- a weekly national survey of popular songs in Ireland. It is compiled by the IRMA from single sales. Below are links to lists showing the songs that have topped the chart. Dates shown represent \\"week-ending\\" IRMA issue dates. Prior to 1992, the Irish singles chart was compiled from trade shipments from the labels to record stores, rather than on consumer sales, and were first broadcast on RTÉ on 1 October 1962. Before this charts had been printed in the Evening Herald newspaper, but are under debate as to whether they are official or not, note that the singles mentioned below are only those that come from the 'official chart', and that no information is given for any number 1's before October 1, 1962. In 1992, the singles chart became based on consumer sales after IFPI and the Irish Recorded Music Association granted a contract to Gallup, a market research company. Gallup installed Epson PX-4 devices in sixty record stores to collect singles sales data. In 1996, Chart- Track was formed as a result of a management buy-out from Gallup. Also in 1996, with the development of technology, EPOS systems were installed in multiple music retail stores. The EPOS systems allowed for the collection of more accurate sales information. Currently, Chart-Track collects data daily from major record stores such as HMV and Tower Records, as well as over forty Independent retailers. In total, data from over three-hundred and eighty stores are collected each week. The singles chart is compiled over seven days and released every Friday at noon by the IRMA, while Midweek Charts are produced daily, but only released to IRMA members.

The nevus can be present at birth, but more often shows up around puberty. It generally first appears as an irregular pigmentation (melanosis or hyperpigmentation) on the torso or upper arm (though other areas of the body can be affected), and gradually enlarges irregularly, becoming thickened and often hairy (hypertrichosis). The nevus is due to an overgrowth of the epidermis, pigment cells (melanocytes), and hair follicles.Ngan, Vanessa. http://www.dermnetnz.org/lesions/beckers- naevus.html This form of nevus was first documented in 1948 by American dermatologist Samuel William Becker (1894–1964).  Clinical information  Medical knowledge and documentation of this disorder is poor, likely due to a combination of factors including recent discovery, low prevalence, and the more or less aesthetic nature of the effects of the skin disorder. Thus the pathophysiology of Becker's nevus remains unclear. While it is generally considered an acquired rather than congenital disorder, there exists at least one case report documenting what researchers claim is a congenital Becker's nevus with genetic association: a 16-month-old boy with a hyperpigmented lesion on his right shoulder whose father has a similar lesion on his right shoulder.  Prevalence  The most extensive study to date, a 1981 survey of nearly 20,000 French males aged 17 to 26, served to disprove many commonly held beliefs about the disorder. In the French study, 100 subjects were found to have Becker's nevi, revealing a prevalence of 0.52%. Nevi appeared in one half the subjects before the age of 10, and between ages 10 and 20 in the rest. In one quarter of cases sun exposure seems to have played a role, a number apparently lower than that expected by researchers. Also surprising to researchers was the low incidence (32%) of Becker's nevi above the nipples, for it had generally been believed that the upper chest and shoulder area was the predominant site of occurrence. Pigmentation was light brown in 75% of cases (note: subjects were Caucasian), and average size of the nevus was 125 cm² (19 in²).  Malignancy  A 1991 report documented the cases of nine patients with both Becker's nevus and malignant melanoma. Of the nine melanomas, five were in the same body area as the Becker's nevus, with only one occurring within the nevus itself. As this was apparently the first documented co-occurrence of the two diseases, there is so far no evidence of higher malignancy rates in Becker's nevi versus normal skin. Nonetheless, as with any abnormal skin growth, the nevus should be monitored regularly and any sudden changes in appearance brought to the attention of one's doctor.  Treatment  As Becker's nevus is considered a benign lesion, treatment is generally not necessary except for cosmetic purposes. Shaving or trimming can be effective in removing unwanted hair, while electrology or laser hair removal may offer a longer-lasting solution. Different types of laser treatments may also be effective in elimination or reduction of hyperpigmentation, though the results of laser treatments for both hair and pigment reduction appear to be highly variable.

The novel follows the adventures of a young Bengali man in the forests of Africa. The novel is one of the most-loved adventure novels in the Bengali literature and is one of Bibhutibhushan's most popular works. It spawned a media franchise. Plot summary This novel tells the story of an ordinary young Bengali man, Shankar Roy Chaudhary, as he adventures in Africa in the years 1909 and 1910. After graduating from college at 20-years-old, his family's financial struggles almost force him take a job in a jute mill in Shyamnagar — a prospect he absolutely loathes. Shankar loves the subject of geography, he wants to follow the footsteps of renowned explorers like Livingstone, Mungo Park, and Marco Polo. He wants to explore the wilderness, passionate for learning about African forests and animals. By a stroke of luck, he gets a job as a clerk at the Uganda Railway and rushes to Africa without a second thought. After a few months laying rail tracks, he encounters the first of many dangers in pre-World War I Africa: a man-eating lion. Later, he takes up a job as station-master in a desolate station amidst the Veldts, where he narrowly escapes a deadly black mamba. While at this post, Shankar encounters, rescues and nurses Diego Alvarez, a middle-age Portuguese explorer and gold/diamond prospector. Alvarez's arrival becomes a turning point in Shankar's life. While recovering, Alvarez describes his exploits in Africa with his friend Jim Carter. He explains that, lured by the prospect of a priceless yellow diamond from a Kaafi village chief, Alvarez and Carter searched for these yellow diamond caves, on the Mountain of the Moon (Chander Pahar) in the Richtersveld. Rumors suggested a mythical monster, the Bunyip, guards the mine. The explorers set off into the dense jungle, much against the villagers' advice, and Carter was gruesomely killed, supposedly by the Bunyip. Shankar, inspired by Alvarez's exploits, resigns from his job and accompanies Alvarez to venture again for the mines. They meet hardships, like a racist gambler, legends about Dingonek the monster and later, a raging volcano. Eventually, they get lost in the forests where Alvarez is killed by the Bunyip. Demoralised, Shankar tries to return to civilization. He finds the Bunyip's cave and the diamond mines by accident. Almost getting lost, he finds the remains of the Italian explorer, Attilio Gatti, and learns that the cave is in fact the diamond mine. Leaving, he becomes lost in the deserts of Kalahari and nearly dies of thirst. Fortunately, he is rescued by a survey team and taken to a hospital in Salisbury, Rhodesia, from where he sets sail for home. Before going back, he writes his account in a newspaper, earning him money. He names the volcano after Alvarez. He ends the book saying that he will return to the cave one day with a large team, and continue the legacy of Alvarez, Carter, and Gatti. Characters *Shankar Roy Chowdhury — The hero of the story, a young man from a village in Bengal. He is a smart, brave person who has a penchant for adventures. *Diego Alvarez — A Portuguese explorer. He is a friend and mentor to Shankar, and together they explore the deepest reaches of Richtersveld for the Mountain of the Moon. *Jim Carter — A British explorer who was Alvarez's companion in his previous expedition. Alvarez revealed to Shankar that Carter was killed by the Bunyip while he and Carter were exploring the Mountains of the Moon. *Attilio Gatti — An Italian explorer. He discovered the diamond mine caves in c. 1879 but dies in a cave (later discovered by Shankar) on his way back, at the hands of his traitorous followers.

It was a minor engagement in about the same location as the more famous Battle of Franklin (November 30, 1864), part of the Franklin-Nashville Campaign. Battle The 1863 engagement at Franklin was a reconnaissance in force by Confederate cavalry leader Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn, coupled with an equally inept response by Union Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger. Van Dorn advanced northward from Spring Hill, Tennessee, on April 10, making contact with Federal skirmishers just outside Franklin. Van Dorn's attack was so weak that when Granger received a false report that Brentwood to the north was under attack, he believed it and sent most of his cavalry northward thinking that Van Dorn was undertaking a diversion. When the truth became known--there was no threat to Brentwood--Granger decided to attack Van Dorn, but was surprised to learn that a subordinate had already done so, without orders. Brig. Gen. David S. Stanley, with a brigade from the 4th U.S. Cavalry, had crossed the Harpeth River at Hughes's Ford, behind the Confederate right rear. Stanley attacked and captured Freeman's Tennessee Battery on the Lewisburg Road, but lost it when Brig. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest counterattacked. This incident in his rear caused Van Dorn to cancel his operations and withdraw to Spring Hill, leaving the Federals in control of the area.

Career Hebner debuted as a professional wrestling referee in the late 1970s in the Richmond, Virginia area. In the 1980s he began working for the World Wrestling Federation, where he refereed many historic matches such as Randy Savage versus Ricky Steamboat at WrestleMania III and Randy Savage versus Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania V. Perhaps his most memorable appearance came on the February 5, 1988 episode of WWF The Main Event, when he was assigned to referee a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship between Hulk Hogan and André the Giant. André defeated Hogan after Hebner's twin brother Earl had switched places as Ted DiBiase had locked Dave in a closet. Earl Hebner quickly counted to three as André pinned Hogan, despite Hogan clearly having his shoulder up. The match and the WWF Championship were awarded to André as a result. Both Hebners received a $2,500 bonus for the match. Prior to WrestleMania IV, the WWF attempted to extend the \\"evil twin\\" referee storyline through a kayfabe \\"investigative report\\" published in the promotions' flagship publication, WWF Magazine. The article used a fictional backstory to build sympathy for Dave by claiming he was continually victimized by Earl's misdeeds committed in Dave's name since their childhoods.\\"A WWF Magazine Investigative Report: Dave Hebner's Shadow,\\" WWF Magazine, June 1988, p. 30. In a 2001 interview with WWF Raw Magazine, Dave Hebner said the angle was soon dropped after he had suffered broken ribs when Earl kicked him (as part of the aftermath of the Hogan-Andre match during The Main Event). As a result, the storyline was shifted to have Earl come clean, and he was the referee when Randy Savage won the Tournament final at WrestleMania IV against Ted DiBiase for the WWF Championship. After retiring as a referee following knee replacement surgery, Hebner became a road agent. He worked as a Road Agent until July 2005, when he was released from contract. After being released, Hebner debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling on the December 17, 2005 episode of TNA Impact!, appearing on the stage during a match between Team 3D and The Diamonds in the Rough. Since 2012, Dave Hebner has been the manager of The Lumberjacks of MMWA Wrestling. Personal life Hebner has been married to his wife Rebecca for 40 years. Dave's identical twin brother Earl and nephew Brian (Earl's son) are also wrestling referees. Hebner has Parkinson's disease. In July 2016, Hebner was named part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that performers incurred \\"long term neurological injuries\\" and that the company \\"routinely failed to care\\" for them and \\"fraudulently misrepresented and concealed\\" the nature and extent of those injuries. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. In September 2018, US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant dismissed the lawsuit.

As an example, for a quantum field theory with one massless scalar field and one self-coupling term, denote the bare field strength by \\\\phi_0 and the bare coupling constant by g_0. In the process of renormalisation, a mass scale M must be chosen. Depending on M, the field strength is rescaled by a constant: \\\\phi = Z\\\\phi_0, and as a result the bare coupling constant g_0 is correspondingly shifted to the renormalised coupling constant g. Of physical importance are the renormalised n-point functions, computed from connected Feynman diagrams, schematically of the form :G^{(n)}(x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_n;M,g) = \\\\langle \\\\phi(x_1)\\\\phi(x_2)\\\\cdots\\\\phi(x_n)\\\\rangle For a given choice of renormalisation scheme, the computation of this quantity depends on the choice of M, which affects the shift in g and the rescaling of \\\\phi.

Ancient Athens Although long walls were built at several locations in ancient Greece, notably Corinth and Megara,\\"Long Walls, the,\\" from The Oxford Classical Dictionary, Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth, ed. the term Long Walls ( ) generally refers to the walls that connected Athens main city to its ports at Piraeus and Phaleron. Built in several phases, they provided a secure connection to the sea even during times of siege. The walls were about 6 km in length, initially constructed in the mid 5th century BC, destroyed by the Spartans in 403 BC after Athens' defeat in the Peloponnesian War, and rebuilt again with Persian support during the Corinthian War in 395-391 BC. The Long Walls were a key element of Athenian military strategy, since they provided the city with a constant link to the sea and thwarted sieges conducted by land alone. History =Background= The ancient wall around the Acropolis was destroyed by the Persians during the occupations of Attica in 480 and 479 BC, part of the Greco-Persian Wars. After the Battle of Plataea, the invading Persian forces were removed and the Athenians were free to reoccupy their land and begin rebuilding their city. Early in the process of rebuilding, construction started on new walls around the city proper. This project drew opposition from the Spartans and their Peloponnesian allies, who were alarmed by the recent increase in the power of Athens. Spartan envoys urged the Athenians not to go through with the construction, arguing that a walled Athens would be a useful base for an invading army, and that the defenses of the Isthmus of Corinth would provide a sufficient shield against invaders. However, despite these concerns, the envoys did not strongly protest and in fact gave helpful advice to the builders. The Athenians disregarded their negative arguments, fully aware that leaving their city unwalled would place them utterly at the mercy of the Peloponnesians;Fine, The Ancient Greeks, 330 Thucydides, in his account of these events, describes a series of complex machinations by Themistocles through which he distracted and delayed the Spartans until the walls were built up high enough to provide adequate protection.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War 1.90–91 =Beginnings= In the early 450s BC, fighting began between Athens and various Peloponnesian allies of Sparta, particularly Corinth and Aegina. In the midst of this fighting between 462 BC and 458 BC, Athens had begun construction of two more walls, the Long Walls, one running from the city to the old port at Phalerum, the other to the newer port at Piraeus. In 457 BC, a Spartan army defeated an Athenian army at Tanagra while attempting to prevent the construction, but work on the walls continued and they were completed soon after the battle. These walls ensured that Athens would never be cut off from supplies as long as she controlled the sea. These Phase 1a walls Conwell, David H. Connecting a City to the Sea: The History of the Athenian Long Walls. Brill NV, 2008. enclosed a vast area and included Athens' two main ports. =Athenian strategy and politics= The building of the Long Walls reflected a larger strategy that Athens had come to follow in the early 5th century. Unlike most Greek city states, which specialized in fielding Hoplite armies, Athens had focused on the navy as the centre of its military since the time of the building of her first fleet during a war with Aegina in the 480s BC. With the founding of the Delian League in 477 BC, Athens became committed to the long term prosecution of a naval war against the Persians. Over the following decades, the Athenian navy became the mainstay of an increasingly imperial league, and Athenian control of the sea allowed the city to be supplied with grain from the Hellespont and Black Sea regions. The naval policy was not seriously questioned by either democrats or oligarchs during the years between 480 and 462 BC, but later, after Thucydides son of Melesias had made opposition to an imperialist policy a rallying cry of the oligarchic faction, the writer known as the Old Oligarch would identify the navy and democracy as inextricably linked, an inference echoed by modern scholars.Kagan, in The Peloponnesian War, describes the oligarchy of 411 BC as fundamentally untenable so long as the fleet remained the crucial military arm of Athens. The long walls were a critical factor in allowing the Athenian fleet to become the city's paramount strength. With the building of the Long Walls, Athens essentially became an island within the mainland, in that no strictly land based force could hope to capture it.Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 87 (In ancient Greek warfare, it was all but impossible to take a walled city by any means other than starvation and surrender.) Thus, Athens could rely on her powerful fleet to keep her safe in any conflict with other cities on the Greek mainland. The walls were completed in the aftermath of the Athenian defeat at Tanagra, in which a Spartan army defeated the Athenians in the field but was unable to take the city because of the presence of the city walls; seeking to secure their city even against siege, the Athenians completed the long walls; and, hoping to prevent all invasions of Attica, they also seized Boeotia, which, as they already controlled Megara, put all approaches to Attica in friendly hands.Kagan, Outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, 95 For most of the First Peloponnesian War, Athens was indeed unassailable by land, but the loss of Megara and Boeotia at the end of that war forced the Athenians to turn back to the long walls as their source of defense. =The Middle Wall= upright=1.5 During the 440's, the Athenians supplemented the existing two Long Walls with a third structure (Phase 1b).Conwell, Connecting a City to the Sea, 77 This \\"Middle Wall\\" or \\"Southern Wall\\" was built to mirror the original Athens- Piraeus Wall and was constructed to be another wall connecting the city to Piraeus. There are many known possibilities for the purpose of the Middle Wall, such as: it was thought to have been built as a back-up defense in case someone penetrated the first Athens-Piraeus Wall. This was proven false however due to the construction of the wall. Its main access points were built so that it would withstand attacks only from the direction of Phaleron. After the naval challenges of 446 BC, Athens was no longer the complete dominant power of the sea, so the Middle Wall is more a backup structure for the Athens-Phaleron Wall. The distance between the two original (phase Ia) walls left a substantial amount of room for amphibious invasions along the coast, and with this new wall, Athenians could retreat within the more narrow area of the two Athens-Piraeus Walls. Also by the time the Middle Wall was built, in the mid-fifth century, the importance of the Athenian ports had changed. Piraeus had become the principal economic and military harbor, while Phaleron had begun to lapse into obscurity. This development will have caused a re- evaluation of the fortification system which secured Athens' connection with its ships.Conwell, Connecting a City to the Sea, 76 =The Peloponnesian War= Lysander has the walls of Athens demolished in 404 BC, as a conclusion to the Peloponnesian War. In Athens' great conflict with Sparta, the Peloponnesian War of 432 BC to 404 BC, the walls came to be of paramount importance. Pericles, the leader of Athens from the start of the war until his death in 429 BC in the plague that swept Athens, based his strategy for the conflict around them. Knowing that the Spartans would attempt to draw the Athenians into a land battle by ravaging their crops, as they had in the 440s, he commanded the Athenians to remain behind the walls and rely on their navy to win the war for them. As a result, the campaigns of the first few years of the war followed a consistent pattern: The Spartans would send a land army to ravage Attica, hoping to draw the Athenians out; the Athenians would remain behind their walls, and send a fleet to sack cities and burn crops while sailing around the Peloponnese. The Athenians were successful in avoiding a land defeat, but suffered heavy losses of crops to the Peloponnesian raids, and their treasury was weakened by the expenditures on the naval expeditions and on import of grain. Furthermore, a plague ravaged the city in 430 BC and 429 BC, with its effects being worsened by the fact that the entire population of the city was concentrated inside the walls. The Athenians continued to use the walls for protection through the first phase of the war until the seizure of Spartan hostages in 425 BC, during the Athenian victory at Pylos. After that battle, the Spartans were forced to cease their yearly invasions until 413 BC, since the Athenians threatened to kill the hostages if an invasion was launched. In the second phase of the war, the walls again became central to the strategy of both sides. The Spartans occupied a fort at Decelea in Attica in 413 BC, and placed a force there that posed a year-round threat to Athens. In the face of this army, the Athenians could only supply the city by sea. Athens was also weakened from the disastrous conclusion of the Sicilian Expedition and began to modify their walls in the summer of 413 BC and ultimately abandoned the Athens-Phaleron Wall, focusing on the two Piraeus Walls. The Long Walls, and the access to a port that they provided, were by now the only thing protecting Athens from defeat. Realizing that they could not defeat the Athenians on land alone, the Spartans turned their attention to constructing a navy, and throughout the final phase of the war devoted themselves to trying to defeat the Athenians at sea. Their eventual success, Aegospotami, cut the Athenians off from their supply routes and forced them to surrender. One of the most important terms of this surrender was the destruction of the long walls which were dismantled in 404 BC. The peace treaty that was reached in the same year also provided the termination of Athens' naval power. Xenophon tells us that the long walls were torn down with much jubilation and to the song of flute girls. =Rebuilding of the Long Walls= The Achaemenid Satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia Pharnabazus II funded the rebuilding the walls of Athens, and provided his seamen as manpower, in 393 BC. Following their defeat in 404, the Athenians quickly regained some of their power and autonomy, and by 403 BC had overthrown the government that the Spartans had imposed on them. By 395 BC, the Athenians were strong enough to enter into the Corinthian War as co-belligerents with Argos, Corinth, and Thebes against Sparta. For the Athenians, the most significant event of this war was the rebuilding of the Long Walls. By 395 BC the rebuilding of the fortifications had begun and according to the Athenian admiral Conon, the walls had reached their final stages by 391 BC. In 394 BC, a Persian fleet under satrap Pharnabazus II and Conon decisively defeated the Spartan fleet at the Battle of Cnidus, and, following this victory, Pharnabazus sent Conon with his fleet to Athens, where it provided aid and protection as the Long Walls were rebuilt. Thus, by the end of the war, the Athenians had regained the immunity from land assault that the Spartans had taken from them at the end of the Peloponnesian War. The rebuilt walls stood for many years, unchallenged, and were never mentioned to have been incorporated in Athens' defense planning until after the 340s BC. According to Xenophon in Hellenica: =The Long Walls in the 4th Century BC= From the Corinthian War down to the final defeat of the city by Philip of Macedon, the Long Walls continued to play a central role in Athenian strategy. The Decree of Aristoteles in 377 BC reestablished an Athenian league containing many former members of the Delian League. By the middle of the 4th century, Athens was again the preeminent naval power of the Greek world, and had reestablished the supply routes that allowed it to withstand a land-based siege. The Long Walls had become obsolete and the length and location of the structures rendered them dangerously vulnerable to the advanced siege techniques of the day. The Athenians began to strengthen their urban defense systems by rebuilding the Long Walls again to be able to withstand contemporary methods of assault in 337 BC. The new walls included attributes such as substructures built of cut blocks and possibly even roofs above the walk-ways. However, the Athenians were not in the position to use the new Long Walls until Alexander the Great's death in 323 BC. By this time Athens' navy had been crushed in the Lamian War and they became subordinate to the Macedonians and the use of the Long Walls in a naval strategy was ruled out. Macedonian leaders controlled cities on both sides of the Long Walls and they had little use for these fortifications, thus the mid-fourth century Long Walls were never actually employed.Conwell, Connecting a City to the Sea, 158 =Later history= The walls were still standing at the beginning of the 1st century BC. However, during the First Mithridatic War, the Siege of Athens and Piraeus (87–86 BC) was won by the Roman general Sulla and he destroyed the Long Walls.

Written by British programmer David Simons in 1983, who was then just 16 years old at the time, it was distributed by Commodore in cartridge format. It is widely, but incorrectly, called \\"Simon's BASIC\\", because of confusion between the first name \\"Simon\\" and the surname \\"Simons\\". Simons' BASIC manual front page. Simons' BASIC cartridge. One of the early Simons' BASIC cartridges, with the misspelled label contributing to the software's naming confusion.'''  Features  Simons' BASIC added 114 additional keywords to BASIC 2.0.Simons' Basic User Manual (Published by Commodore) These included commands to ease the coding of sprites, high-resolution and multicolor graphics, and sound. In addition, commands were also implemented to aid in structured programming. Keywords to assist in writing and editing BASIC programs, similar to those in the VIC-20 Programmer's Aid cartridge, were also included. Also, programs written in Simons' BASIC could employ hexadecimal numbers in assignments and calculations by including a \`$\` prefix, or binary numbers by utilizing a \`%\` prefix. Because a portion of the cartridge data was mapped into memory at addresses $8000–$9FFF, which overlapped part of the standard C64 BASIC RAM, the amount of available memory for BASIC programs was 8 KB less than that of a standard C64 configuration. A further extension was also written by Simons and released by Commodore on floppy disk and tape as Simons' Basic Extension. This software is also known as Simons' Basic 2. It could not be released on cartridge because the original Simons' Basic cartridge had to be present in order to use the extension. Simons' Basic Extension added another 91 extra commands including a much coveted RENUMber command which also took care of renumbering the destinations of GOTO and GOSUB statements.Simons' Basic 2 User Manual (Published by Commodore)  The 114 keywords  = Sprite (MOB) handling keywords = * \`MOB SET\` – enables a sprite and defines its attributes * \`MMOB\` – positions a sprite on the screen * \`RLOCMOB\` – causes a sprite to smoothly move from one location to another * \`CMOB\` – sets up the two global colors for multicolor sprites * \`MOB OFF\` – disables a sprite * \`DETECT\` – initializes sprite collision detection * \`CHECK\` – checks for a sprite collision = High resolution graphics handling keywords = * \`HIRES\` – initializes a high-resolution graphics mode * \`MULTI\` – initializes a multicolor graphics mode * \`NRM\` – returns to the text display * \`LOW COL\` – changes the plotting colors * \`HI COL\` – returns to the original plotting colors * \`PLOT\` – draws a pixel * \`LINE\` – draws a line * \`CIRCLE\` – draws a circle * \`ARC\` – draws an arc * \`ANGL\` – draws the radius of a circle * \`PAINT\` – performs a flood fill * \`REC\` – draws a hollow rectangle * \`BLOCK\` – draws a solid rectangle * \`DRAW\` – draws a user-defined set of lines * \`ROT\` – sets scaling factors for \`DRAW\` * \`CHAR\` – plots a text character on a high- resolution screen * \`TEXT\` – plots a text string on a high-resolution screen * \`TEST\` – determines whether a pixel is plotted or empty = Other graphics handling keywords = * \`COLOUR\` – sets the background and border colors.

The album includes the song \\"C-64\\".  Reception  Creative Computing stated that Simons' BASIC \\"almost makes the 64 into a new computer. (Probably the one it should have been in the first place.)\\" It praised the \\"very fine manual\\" as a contrast to Commodore's usually poor documentation, and predicted that it would become \\"the standard language for programming the machine … Commodore had better be planning to manufacture lots of copies because they will go fast\\". Ahoy! wrote \\"If you do any programming in BASIC and should happen to see this product on a dealer's shelf, do not ask any questions—do not hesitate—just buy it!\\" The magazine praised Simons' BASIC's power and \\"excellent manual\\", and stated that \\"its price makes it one of the biggest bargains available for the Commodore 64\\". RUNs review was less favorable, stating that its \\"many powerful and useful commands … were, unfortunately, implemented very poorly for a commercial package. There is very little command parameter checking, and many things have been overlooked or ignored.\\" The original SIMONS' BASIC cartridge (without the extension) has no provisions for reading the error channel on the Commodore 1541 and Commodore 1571 disk drives, nor can it perform a DIRectory listing of files or issue a DISK command on any disk drive other than Drive #8 when more than one disk drive is connected to the Commodore 64. And while most \\"standard\\" BASIC 2.0 keywords can be abbreviated by typing the first or first and second letters and then holding down the SHIFT key while typing the second (or third) letter after that, all SIMONS' BASIC keywords must be completely spelled out in full exactly as shown in the accompanying user's manual. This includes the commands COLOUR (which selects the background color and exterior border color), and CENTRE (which prints text message that are \\"centered\\" on the screen), both of which are spelled correctly for the British and are incorporated that way into SIMONS' BASIC.

History  Palmerston was a key division point for the Grand Trunk and later the Canadian National Railway in Southwestern Ontario with 65 subdivisions; Owen Sound, Kincardine, Durham, Fergus, Guelph Junction and Stratford. In its original concept the railroad was to run from Guelph to Southampton, Ontario and would not have gone through Palmerston. Listowel needed to be linked to the railroad and it was decided to bend the route toward Listowel. It was also decided that a yard with maintenance shops would be needed. The mainline under Canadian National ownership became part of the Fergus, Owen Sound and Southampton Subdivisions. Passenger service ceased in 1971. The subdivisions were abandoned starting with Fergus to Palmerston August 1983, Harriston Jct. to Port Elgin and Southampton in 1988, Guelph to Fergus 1988, and Palmerston to Harriston 1995. all rail service terminated in 1996 with CN abandoning the line from Stratford to Harriston.Visit Perth County, Ontario: the website of the Perth County Visitor's Association When the railroad decided to build a junction and maintenance sheds between Guelph, Harriston and Listowel, this also included a station. One of the active supporters of the railroad was John McDermott, Reeve of Wallace and, because of this support, the railways decided to let McDermot name the station. He named it Palmerston in 1870 in honour of Henry John Temple, the third Viscount Palmerston. As soon as the railroad decided where it would build, people started buying property around the area for businesses and homes. Another historic plaque discusses the Ontario Vaccine Farm, opened in 1885 by Dr. Alexander Stewart in order to produce smallpox vaccine. Until about 1907, much of the vaccine used in Ontario was produced here; later, farms in the U.S. took much of the business. Stewart died in 1911 but the farm continued under H.B. Coleman until 1916. Afterwards, the farm closed and program was taken over by the University of Toronto. In 1995, the Progressive Conservative government of Ontario began to reduce the number of total municipalities in the province.

It was built by the successful businessman George Norgan who had made his fortune in Vancouver, BC. He came home to Palmerston in 1947 and noticed the lack of leisure opportunities in the town. To address this situation, he personally donated $50,000 for the construction of a movie theatre. It opened on August 18, 1947 and was named after him. The Norgan Theatre was renovated in 2007.

Mechanical Stimulation Mechanically, arteriogenesis is linked to elevated pressure, which increases radial wall stress, and elevated flow, which increases endothelial surface stress. The vessel increases in diameter until the stress is normalized (Prior et al., 2004). Arteriogenesis does not occur every time there is an increase in flow, however. Most vessel networks can handle increased flow without increasing diameter because flow is related to vessel diameter by a power of four. Initial experiments demonstrated this phenomenon in that mature vessels are unlikely to respond to increased flow by increasing diameter, but will respond to decreased flow by decreasing diameter (Brownlee & Langille, 1991). Another experiment showed that increasing shear stress caused an immediate increase in vessel expansion followed by a rapid decrease, as well as demonstrating that the mature vessels do indeed respond more favorably to decreased stress (Tuttle et al., 2001). Chemical Stimulation =General= Chemically, arteriogenesis is related to upregulation of cytokines and cell adhesion receptors. More specifically, mechanical stresses cause endothelial cells to produce chemical facilitators that begin the process of increasing diameter. An increase in shear stress causes an increase in the number of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) molecules expressed on the surface of vessel walls as well as increased levels of TNF-α, bFGF, and MMP. MCP-1 increases the tendency of monocytes to attach to the cell wall. TNF-α provides an inflammatory environment for the cells to develop while bFGF helps induce mitosis in the endothelial cells. Finally, MMPs remodel the space around the artery to provide the space for expansion (Van Royen et al., 2001). Another potent chemical signal is nitric oxide (NO), demonstrated to be a major factor in increasing vessel diameter in response to increased flow until the shear stress is restored to the normal level (Tronc et al., 1996). =bFGF= bFGF is known to increase both arteriogenesis and angiogenesis in vivo. However, it is not sufficient as a monotherapy to increase arteriogenesis. In a placebo study determining the effects of bFGF on arteriogenesis, patients were treated with one bolus of bFGF. The treatment helped reduce anginal symptoms but did not significantly affect arteriogenesis. Thus, it is speculated that other growth factors work in tandem with bFGF to produce the desired response and that growth factors must be administered at varying time points throughout the duration of the experiment (Van Royen et al., 2001). This finding is important because it shows that arteriogenesis is the result of a combination of signaling cascades and growth factors as opposed to being tied to a single chemical. =CCL2= MCP1 (now called CCL2) is especially important in arteriogenesis. Since MCP-1 attracts monocytes it can produce an immune cascade to aid inflammation. Monocytes can enter the vessel wall to become macrophages and produce inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α in addition to aiding the production of bFGF and MMP (Van Royen et al., 2000). Macrophages also produce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that is a huge contributor to the growth signaling of endothelial cells. Endothelial cells have a receptor devoted to VEGF aptly named VEGF receptor-1 that immediately signals rapid mitosis in the cells (Prior et al., 2004). One study showed that local infusion of MCP-1 caused a large increase in conductance in both collateral and peripheral vessels while diminished levels of MCP-1 hindered the process of arteriogenesis (Ito et al., 1997). This indicates that monocytes play a significant role in inducing arteriogenesis. Applications of Arteriogenesis =Exercise= Poiseuille’s Law for flow indicates that the total flow in a tube is related to the diameter of the tube by a power of four. Thus, an increase in the diameter of a high order blood vessel such as an arteriole vastly increases the total flow that a given vessel network can withstand. This flow increase is vitally important in the microvasculature remodeling following exercise, especially in sprint training. Sprint training is a type of anaerobic exercise that relies on having the maximum amount of blood available to the vessel network at any given time (Prior et al., 2004). =Atherosclerosis= Arteriogenesis also has much in common with the mechanisms of atherosclerosis. Monocytes invade the endothelial tissue, inflammatory cytokines are released, endothelial cells proliferate into the surrounding tissue, and cell adhesion receptors are upregulated. Presently, the effects of arteriogenesis on atherosclerosis are unknown, although MCP-1 receptors are known to be associated with plaque formation (Van Royen et al., 2001).

Weyl- squared theories The simplest theory in this category has the square of the Weyl tensor as the Lagrangian :\\\\mathcal{S}=\\\\int \\\\mathrm{d}^4x \\\\sqrt{-g} C_{abcd}C^{abcd}, where C_{abcd} is the Weyl tensor. This is to be contrasted with the usual Einstein–Hilbert action where the Lagrangian is just the Ricci scalar. The equation of motion upon varying the metric is called the Bach equation, :2\\\\, abla_a\\\\, abla_d{{C^a}_{bc}}^d+{{C^a}_{bc}}^dR_{ad}=0, where R_{ab} is the Ricci tensor. Conformally flat metrics are solutions of this equation. Since these theories lead to fourth-order equations for the fluctuations around a fixed background, they are not manifestly unitary. It has therefore been generally believed that they could not be consistently quantized. This is now disputed. Four-derivative theories Conformal gravity is an example of a 4-derivative theory. This means that each term in the wave equation can contain up to 4 derivatives. There are pros and cons of 4-derivative theories. The pros are that the quantized version of the theory is more convergent and renormalisable. The cons are that there may be issues with causality. A simpler example of a 4-derivative wave equation is the scalar 4-derivative wave equation: : \\\\operatorname{\\\\Box}^2 \\\\Phi =0 The solution for this in a central field of force is: : \\\\Phi(r)= 1 - \\\\frac{2m}{r} +ar +br^2 The first two terms are the same as a normal wave equation. Because this equation is a simpler approximation to conformal gravity, m corresponds to the mass of the central source. The last two terms are unique to 4-derivative wave equations. It has been suggested that small values be assigned to them to account for the galactic acceleration constant (also known as dark matter) and the dark energy constant. The solution equivalent to the Schwarzschild solution in general relativity for a spherical source for conformal gravity has a metric with: : \\\\varphi(r) = g^{00} = (1-6bc)^\\\\frac{1}{2} - \\\\frac{2b}{r} + c r + \\\\frac{d}{3} r^2 to show the difference between general relativity. 6bc is very small so can be ignored. The problem is that now c is the total mass-energy of the source, b is the integral of density times distance to source squared. So this is a completely different potential to general relativity and not just a small modification. The main issue with conformal gravity theories, as well as any theory with higher derivatives, is the typical presence of ghosts, which point to instabilities of the quantum version of the theory, although there might be a solution to the ghost problem. An alternative approach is to consider the gravitational constant as a symmetry broken scalar field in which case you would consider a small correction to Newtonian gravity like this (where we consider \\\\varepsilon to be a small correction: : \\\\operatorname \\\\Box \\\\Phi + \\\\varepsilon^2 \\\\operatorname{\\\\Box}^2 \\\\Phi = 0 in which case the general solution is the same as the Newtonian case except there can be an additional term: : \\\\Phi = 1 - \\\\frac{2m}{r} \\\\left( 1 + \\\\alpha \\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac r \\\\varepsilon +\\\\beta\\\\right) \\\\right) where there is an additional component varying sinusoidally over space. The wavelength of this variation could be quite large such as an atomic width. Thus there appears to be several stable potentials around a gravitational force in this model. Conformal unification to the Standard Model By adding a suitable gravitational term to the standard model action in curved spacetime, the theory develops a local conformal (Weyl) invariance. The conformal gauge is fixed by choosing a reference mass scale based on the gravitational coupling constant. This approach generates the masses for the vector bosons and matter fields similar to the Higgs mechanism without traditional spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Los Angeles Times. is an American magician. Valentino starred in a series of four television specials exposing the methods behind numerous classic magic tricks and illusions on the Fox network. In the specials, he used the stage name the Masked Magician and concealed his true identity by wearing a mask with a squid like design, being aware of the stigma amongst the magic community with publicly exposing tricks. As the finale to the final special, Valentino revealed his identity as the masked magician, garnering some notoriety amongst the magic community, and instigating several lawsuits. Valentino became well known in Brazil after his sketches were broadcast in Rede Globo's Sunday newsmagazine show Fantástico from 1999 to 2000, in which he was referred by the alias Mister M. Life and career Valentino's first foray into magic was at the age of five with a trick called \\"the ball and vase\\" that his father gave him. In his teens, Valentino performed with the \\"International Cultural Awareness Program\\" for over a million students throughout the Unified School Systems. The performances also included revealing magic secrets to encourage others to become magicians. By the end of the 1980s and into the 1990s, Valentino had moved to Las Vegas, Nevada and was performing in casino shows including Viva Las Vegas and Splash, after having appeared on The Merv Griffin Show, as well as in the music video for Herb Alpert's \\"Magic Man\\". In October 2017, Valentino announced that he had been diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer, and was given one year to live from the time of the diagnosis. Valentino refused conventional treatment. In June 2020, in an interview with the Brazilian show Domingo Espetacular of RecordTV, he said he was cured and that he is in Brazil, preparing a project, with the pandemic of COVID-19, the magician is quarantined in the country, hosted at the Clown Rogério house. =The Masked Magician= For a span of two years (1997–1999), Valentino performed, unbilled and disguised, as the \\"Masked Magician\\" in four Fox Network specials called Breaking the Magician's Code: Magic's Biggest Secrets Finally Revealed which exposed long-guarded trade secrets. The Masked Magician was also shown in the UK on the ITV network during the late 1990s and is still occasionally repeated on ITV4. In the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, the show was made available on Netflix. Valentino had been approached by Fox while he was performing in Las Vegas showrooms. After some negotiation, Valentino signed to do the program, promising that he would reveal the secrets behind old illusions only. At the end of the fourth and final special, Valentino revealed his true identity, although some in the magic community had already deduced it from the previous specials after recognizing certain traits of his performance. After revealing himself, Valentino emphasized that he felt that revealing the secrets would encourage children into trying magic instead of discouraging them, and that the entertainment of magic shows was more in the magician's showmanship instead of the wonder of how the trick was pulled off. He later stated on Reddit: \\"The main reason I did the program was to get Magicians talking about the future of the Magical Arts as the Internet was about to change everything, as it has. ... Magicians had become complacent and were not prepared for any changes that were to come. The program seemed to be the place to 'shack' [sic] things up and get magicians talking. Sure I took some flack but it was all for a good cause to get magicians talking.\\" Criticism was levelled at Valentino by magicians for adversely affecting their acts. Kevin Spencer, a touring magician based in Lynchburg, Virginia who performs with his wife, Cindy, says the specials forced the duo to scrap two of their tricks. Spencer stated, \\"We're disappointed that someone who made his living performing the art of magic for over 25 years would be so quick to betray their community.\\" As those illusions cost as much as $50,000 apiece, the Spencers brought a lawsuit against Valentino, one of several that resulted from the program. Another lawsuit was brought by magician Andre Kole, who unsuccessfully tried to prevent Fox from airing a special featuring the secret behind the Table of Death, an illusion Kole says he perfected. According to Kole, he licensed the trick to seven of the top 10 magicians in the world and estimated his financial damages as a result of the special at more than $500,000. Kole's attorney conceded the inherent difficulty in suing over the loss of a magic trick, since illusions are not among the intellectual properties covered by copyright law, but stated, \\"Magicians and designers of magic tricks haven't had to take those steps. A handshake has worked for several centuries.\\" Other magicians criticized Valentino's explanations for being sloppy or inaccurate, arguing that he gives a mistaken impression that the methods he's exposing are regularly used by professional magicians. Magician Mark Wilson, who hosted the 1960s Saturday morning children's TV series The Magic Land of Allakazam, says some of Valentino's reveals were dangerous and not generally used by fellow magicians. New episodes of the show later returned to broadcast on MyNetworkTV. Episodes were also made available on Netflix and the Fox Reality Channel with Valentino reprising the role. Valentino also appeared in the Masked Magician persona on a 1999 episode of Diagnosis: Murder. In October 2007, a graphic novel starring the character of the Masked Magician was released by Heavy Ink. In 2012, the website of Nash Entertainment—the producers of the Breaking the Magician's Code: Magic's Biggest Secrets Finally Revealed—listed a movie called Masked Magician, about a magician who uses illusions to fight crime, was \\"in development\\".

Owned by Dougall Media, the station broadcasts a hot adult contemporary format at 91.5 FM, and 93.5 FM in Atikokan, Ontario.  History  The station was originally launched in Midland in 1927. It was purchased by the Dougall Motor Car Company in 1931, and moved to Fort William. The station originally aired at 890 AM, moving to 780 in 1933, 930 in 1935, 730 in 1938 and finally 580 in 1941. The station became an affiliate of the CBC's Trans-Canada Network in 1947 and then an affiliate of CBC Radio in 1962. In 1948, the station's owners launched an FM simulcast on CKPR-FM. In 1962, the owners also acquired CFPA-TV, the city's CBC Television affiliate, which then adopted the CKPR callsign as well. In 2006, Dougall applied to change the station's frequency to 91.5 FM. This application was approved by the CRTC on February 2, 2007.CRTC Decision 2007–55 The transition occurred on June 4, 2007 at 12:00 PM ET and was simulcast on Thunder Bay Television. The AM 580 signal then went to a repeating message advising listeners to tune to 91.5 FM. It's believed that CKPR 580 AM had left the air for good on August 3, 2007, however, the 580 AM signal was to leave the air by early September of that year. After the station's FM conversion, the station adopted an adult contemporary format, dropping its former news/talk programming. The station eventually evolved to its current hot adult contemporary format. On March 2, 2011, the station applied to the CRTC to add an FM transmitter at Atikokan, Ontario to rebroadcast the programming of CKPR- FM Thunder Bay. The CRTC approved C.J.S.D.

He played for the St. George Dragons from 1959 to 1967 and represented Australia in a then record 36 Tests and three World Cup games. He was the captain of the national side on eight occasions between 1962–1967. Gasnier was included on the National Rugby League's list of 100 greatest players and the honorary Team of the Century. He is a member of the Sport Australia Hall of Fame and Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame. He was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia. Early life Reginald William Gasnier was born in the Southern Sydney suburb of Mortdale on 12 May 1939. At Sutherland Intermediate High School, Gasnier excelled at both rugby and cricket. He later attended Sydney Technical High School (\\"Tech\\") in the St. George area suburb of Bexley. While at Tech, he became a champion sportsman in both rugby and cricket, achieving junior state representative honours in both sports. He went on to play rugby league for junior club Renown United. Gasnier was selected in the NSW schoolboys side aged 13, to play in a curtain raiser to the 1952 Australia and New Zealand Test. Career Gasnier has been described as the ultimate all-round rugby league player. Teammate Keith Barnes recalled: \\"He had everything, a body swerve, speed and acceleration. He could stand you up or run around you. There was no better sight in rugby league than when he threw his head back and left them standing.\\" Dave Bolton, who played against Gasnier in international play remarked: \\"He was a great player. Along with Eric Ashton the best centre I’ve ever seen. He was very fast and very deceptive. You never knew what he would do next. He'd be running straight and then veer left or right.\\" Upon Gasnier's retirement then ARL chairman Bill Buckley said, \\"[In] his day, he was the greatest rugby league player I have ever seen. Gasnier had an amazing change of pace and great anticipation. He was also particularly unselfish. He was without peer.\\" Gasnier was nicknamed \\"Puff the Magic Dragon\\" and the \\"prince of centres\\" for his high-quality play. =St. George Dragons= In 1957, Gasnier, aged 18, focused his attention on rugby league, signing with the local St. George Dragons for the 1958 season. After only six games in third grade, he was selected for his first grade debut, and after only five first grade games he was selected for New South Wales. He scored 15 tries in 16 games for his state team. By 1959, Gasnier had become an established member of both the New South Wales state side and the Australian international team. He was an important member of the dominant Dragons team of the late 1950s/early 1960s that won 11 consecutive premiership victories, of which Gasnier was on the team for six.Jubilee Avenue Dragons Legends ; accessed 11 May 2014. He finished his career with the Dragons in 1967, with 127 tries and 20 goals in 125 appearances and 6 premierships. Reg Gasnier is widely regarded as one of the greatest ever St. George Dragons players. =National team= In 1959, Gasnier moved up from reserve to Test team, making his international debut for Australia against New Zealand in the 1st Test of 1959 in Sydney. He played in all three Tests of that series, and went on to tour Britain with the Kangaroos. On the tour, he scored a hat trick in the 1st Test 22–14 victory against Great Britain at Swinton's Station Road (attendance 35,224). However the Ashes were retained by the home nation after wins in the remaining Tests at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds (11–10, attendance 30,184) and Central Park (Wigan) (18–12, attendance 26,089). In 1960, he played in World Cup finals as a member of the national team. He is listed on the Australian Players Register as Kangaroo No. 339.ARL Annual Report 2005, page 54 Gasnier became Australia's youngest ever captain in 1962 when he led Australia against England at 23 years and 28 days. The following season, he toured Europe as a member of the National Team for a second time. In 1967-68, he again toured Europe, this time as coach-captain of the Kangaroos. His career ended prematurely, at age 28, when he broke his leg during the first test at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds, that saw him sit out the remainder of the English leg. He returned to the field in France but in a minor game against Les Espoirs in Avignon, he suffered a further break of the leg. This would ultimately cause him to announce his retirement from playing at the age of just 28. He later told in an interview that he never regretted his decision to retire, explaining that he had been playing rugby league virtually non-stop including juniors, junior representative games, the Sydney premiership, interstate games and international tours since the early 1950s, and felt it was about time that he started devoting more time to his family. He finished his international career as Australia's most capped player, with a total of 39 caps (36 Test and 3 World Cup), a record that remained until Mal Meninga broke it in 1992. Gasnier scored 28 tries for Australia and captained the side on eight occasions. =Media career= After retiring from the playing field in 1967, Gasnier was involved in the media side of rugby league, becoming a sports writer and broadcaster. He provided expert analysis on the ABC's Grandstand television coverage during the 1970s. Personal life and death While at Sydney Technical High School, Gasnier met his future wife Maureen (née Sullivan). The couple wed in 1962. Gasnier was the uncle of the rugby league footballer Mark Gasnier, who, like his uncle, was a centre and played for both NSW (12 games) and Australia (15 tests). In 2010, Gasnier underwent major surgery to remove tumours from his neck and brain. On 11 May 2014, the day before his 75th birthday, he died in a Miranda nursing home after a long illness. He was survived by his wife, son Peter, daughter Kellie, and four grandchildren. Maureen died on 30 September 2016. Honours In 1981, Gasnier was selected as one of the initial four post-war \\"Immortals\\" of the Australian game along with Clive Churchill, Johnny Raper and Bob Fulton. In December of that year, he was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame and in 2002, he was inducted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame.\\"Gasnier\\", sahof.org.au retrieved 27 September 2020.

More formally, let (M, g) be a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Then (M, g) is conformally flat if for each point x in M, there exists a neighborhood U of x and a smooth function f defined on U such that (U, e2fg) is flat (i.e. the curvature of e2fg vanishes on U). The function f need not be defined on all of M. Some authors use locally conformally flat to describe the above notion and reserve conformally flat for the case in which the function f is defined on all of M. Examples *Every manifold with constant sectional curvature is conformally flat. *Every 2-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold is conformally flat. *A 3-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold is conformally flat if and only if the Cotton tensor vanishes. *An n-dimensional pseudo- Riemannian manifold for n ≥ 4 is conformally flat if and only if the Weyl tensor vanishes. *Every compact, simply connected, conformally Euclidean Riemannian manifold is conformally equivalent to the round sphere. *In general relativity conformally flat manifolds can often be used, for example to describe Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric.

Lauderdale History WQAM-FM signed on the air in 1947, owned by the Miami Herald. It was a full-time simulcast with WQAM-AM. In 1957, when Storz Broadcasting purchased WQAM-AM, the FM signal was taken off the air, and the license returned to the FCC, as Storz was not interested in FM at that time. The station returned to the air in 1962, with 81,000 watts under the WAEZ calls. It was the first station in Miami to broadcast continuously in stereo. It played easy listening music \\"from the beautiful Deauville Hotel in Miami Beach.\\" The station was owned by Arthur E. Zucker, hence the \\"AEZ\\" in the station's calls. In 1969 it changed its calls to WOCN- FM to reflect its sister station WOCN, which it was now partially simulcasting. It continued to play its format, and even began an attempt at Spanish language romance music. For a brief moment during the mid-1970s, they were known as \\"Stereo 94\\". In 1975, it became WINZ-FM under Guy Gannett Broadcasting, and went to a progressive rock format, with the moniker \\"Zeta-4\\" until early 1981, when it flipped to CHR/Pop station \\"I-95\\", retaining the WINZ-FM calls. \\"I-95\\" provided for a highly competitive ratings battle against Top 40 powerhouse WHYI during its few years of existence, becoming #1 in the Miami ARB. In early 1986, WINZ-FM transformed from Top-40 to a short-lived Classic Rock/Adult Hits hybrid as \\"Rockin' With Class....95-INZ\\". This lasted for about a year until early 1987 when the station flipped to Classic rock as Zeta, this time with the WZTA call letters. This is where the station would begin a long term commitment as a rocker. In the early-90s, the station was purchased by Paxson Communications and then swallowed up by Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia) in the mid-90s. Under Paxson, the station evolved to an active rock format, still retaining the WZTA calls. In the early new millennium, Zeta attempted an Alternative rock format, but switched back to the active rock format in 2004. With ratings continuing to slump, and Lex and Terry underperforming, Zeta finally came to an end on February 10, 2005 after 19 years as a rock station.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2005/RR-2005-02-18.pdfhttp://formatchange.com/94-9-zeta-becomes- mega-94-9/ Mega 94.9 was born, with the new calls WMGE, which previously existed in Miami-Ft. Lauderdale on what is now urban WMIB, also under the Clear Channel umbrella. The station was part of Clear Channel's effort to expand its Hispanic radio efforts, as they were flipping several more stations to Spanish formats the same year under the leadership of Alfredo Alonso. Coincidentally, with no more active rock stations in the market, Cox Radio flipped their CHR-dance station Party 93.1 to active rocker 93Rock, with new calls WHDR, on February 14, 2005. Like other Hispanic Urban formatted stations, Mega was a hybrid of both English and Spanish language. Logo for Mega 94.9, 2005-2007 former logo, 2007-2014 The new Mega 94.9, however, continued to lose a listening base and failed to improve beyond its old rock format after two years on the air, and the station was adjusted to a Hispanic top 40 format in 2007. On September 9, 2016, WMGE rebranded as \\"Tu 94.9.\\"https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/108138/iheartmedia-launches- tu-94-9-miami-with-enrique-santos-as-chairman-of-iheartlatino/ The station changed its call sign to the current WZTU on September 16, 2016.

This is to be accomplished using an array of radio antennas suspended from a helium balloon flying at a height of about 37,000 meters. The ANITA-IV experiment in Antarctica, prior to being launched on a balloon. The neutrinos, with energies on the order of 1018 eV, produce radio pulses in the ice because of the Askaryan effect. It is thought that these high-energy cosmic neutrinos result from interaction of ultra-high-energy (1020 eV) cosmic rays with the photons of the cosmic microwave background radiation. It is thus hoped that the ANITA experiment can help to explain the origin of these cosmic rays.  Experimental time frame  ANITA-I launched from McMurdo, Antarctica in the summer of 2006–07. The array should travel around the continent with the circumpolar winds for approximately a month before being recovered by the CSBF. Each successive mission (if funded) would be at two-year intervals. ANITA-II, a modified instrument with 40 antennas, launched from McMurdo Station in the summer of 2008–2009. ANITA-III, expected to improve sensitivity by a factor of 5–10, launched in December 2014. ANITA-IV launched in December 2016, with a lighter overall build, tunable notch filters and an improved trigger system.  Funding  ANITA is a collaboration of multiple universities, led by UH Manoa and funded through grants by NASA and the U.S. Department of Energy.  Results  , ANITA has made three flights and detected numerous neutrinos coming from above the experiment, where the radio waves are reflected before they reach ANITA. Two events have signatures indicating that they came from below. These events were unexpected as Earth should absorb most neutrinos of this energy. A follow-up study by the IceCube experiment, which is more sensitive than ANITA and located deep within the ice, did not detect any neutrinos from the direction of the apparent source from below. It is therefore thought that the observed events come from cosmic rays that have reflected off the ice but for unexplained reason did not change polarization when reflected.  Collaborators  The current ANITA collaboration team includes members from the University of Hawaii at Manoa; University of California, Los Angeles; The Ohio State University; The University of Delaware; The University of Kansas; Washington University; the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory; University College London; University of Chicago; National Taiwan University; and the California Polytechnic State University.

Sudhir Kumar for the banner Venkateswaralayam. The film featured Ajith Kumar, making it his 25th film and Shalini in the lead roles with Raghuvaran, Raadhika and Nassar in other pivotal roles. The film opened in August 1999 to positive reviews from critics and became a blockbuster at the box office. The film was dubbed in Telugu as Adbutham. It was also remade in Telugu as Leela Mahal Center and in Kannada as Asura. Plot Vasu (Ajith Kumar) is a ruthless hooligan who lives in a cinema theater owned by Aarumugam (Vinu Chakravarthy). He had a tortured childhood and wastes his days by drinking, fighting, and sleeping. It all starts when Vasu's friend, Thilak (Dhamu) loses an Annaamalai movie reel to Mohana (Shalini). Vasu and Mohana clash when he attempts to retrieve the reel. Mohana's family are members of the police, headed by Birla Bose (Nassar), Mohana's father. At this point, Tulasi Das (Raghuvaran), an ex-mafia \\"dada\\" who spent many years in jail because of Bose, comes to the theater. He does not like Bose and hires Vasu to kidnap Mohana. Vasu later cries out his woes in the song \\"Satham Illatha.\\" Mohana falls in love with Vasu after hearing his pain. When Tulasi realizes that Mohana loves Vasu, he hires Vasu to pretend that he loves her back. At first it is just pretend, but then he too begins to love her. Tulasi visits Bose to inform him of his daughter's love for a gangster and realizes that Mohana is indeed his daughter. A flashback showing the parted friendship between the two men, and Ganga (Raadhika), Tulasi's wife, abandons him and their child when she comes to know that her husband is a don. Knowing that Mohana is his daughter, Tulasi instructs Vasu to give up his love. When Vasu refuses, Tulasi visits Mohana and tells her about his ploy and that Vasu's love for her was fake. Eventually, Vasu proves to Mohana that his love was true and unites with her after a clash between the cops and some goons of the locality.

The film initially began production without a script but only title Amarkalam being revealed. Saran initially came up with script revolving around gangster who loses his eyesight and makes lot of enemies however he changed the script when his friends told him that several films on similar subject were made at that time. He built a story around a setup of \\"a father meets his daughter without she releasing that he was her dad\\" based on a film he had seen and made this script completely into \\"a hero-centric film\\". =Casting= Jyothika was the first choice for lead actress but couldn't accept due to scheduling conflicts. Saran initially approached Shalini, who was studying at the time and she refused but after a three-month pursuit, he finally got her to sign on as well. Saran wanted Shalini because he found her \\"eyes to be arresting\\" and she gained \\"image of 'everybody’s adorable daughter' after Kadhalukku Mariyadhai\\", which he felt would be right for this role. The role of Tulasi Das was initially offered to Amitabh Bachchan who accepted before later pulling out of the film. Raghuvaran was Saran's next choice for the role who agreed because Saran felt \\"he’d understand this complex character, who wasn’t a violent one or routine villain character. Also, I was particular that no one should be able to guess the film’s turning point\\". =Filming= The film began production in January 1999 and during the production of the film, the lead pair Ajith Kumar and Shalini fell in love and eventually got married in April 2000. For the lead protagonist's staying place, Saran decided to use film theatre as a backdrop, he found Srinivasa Theatre after looking at its infrastructure. Soundtrack The film's score and soundtrack was composed by Bharathwaj, with lyrics written by Vairamuthu. Shalini sang a song in the film, with Saran recommending her after he had heard her humming to a tune. Saran did not want the song \\"Satham Illamal\\" to be cinematic for that he created a sad past of Ajith Kumar's character to justify the presence of the song in the film. The song's lyrics was based on a poem written by Vairamuthu where every line ended with the word \\"vendum\\" (I want). Bharathwaj suggested that \\"instead of 'vendum', we should use 'kaetaen' (I asked), so that the song would convey that the hero asked for everything, but ultimately didn’t get any, including death\\". S. P. Balasubrahmanyam performed this song in an breathless manner. Release The reviewer from Indolink said, \\"There are no compelling performances to give sheen to the fairly complex plot cooked up by director Charan in Amarkalam. The director's screenplay also loses steam midway resulting in a lukewarm payoff to a good premise. The end product plays out like a dull rehash of Puthiya Pathai and numerous other gangster movies.\\" The film went on to become a large commercial success at the box office, extending the lead actor Ajith Kumar's success after his previous film Vaali. Ajith Kumar went on to purchase Saran a car as a token of gratitude for the success. =Re-release= A digitally restored version of Amarkalam was released in May 2014 celebrating the 43rd birthday of actor Ajith Kumar. Remakes Due to the success of the film, it was subsequently dubbed into the Telugu language with title Adbhutam and produced by V. Sathyanarayana. It was later remade in Kannada as Asura starring Shiva Rajkumar and Raghuvaran, who reprised his role. Despite the release of dubbed version there was a 2004 remake version in Telugu titled Leela Mahal Center with Aryan Rajesh.

Its headquarters are at 8105 North 16th Street, Phoenix, Arizona. The current bishop is the Most Reverend John Stephen Pazak. The Eparchy's territorial jurisdiction consists of thirteen Western States. Churches are presently located in the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, and Washington. It is a suffragan of the Archeparchy of Pittsburgh. Currently, Holy Protection Eparchy of Phoenix has 19 parishes and one mission under its canonical jurisdiction. Most parishes follow the Ruthenian recension, although the eparchy includes one parish of the Italo- Greek tradition. History The creation of a new eparchy for the western United States was proposed by the metropolitan Council of Hierarchs in 1981. The Congregation for the Oriental Churches a dicastery of the Roman Curia responsible for the Eastern Catholic Churches in communion with the Holy See, recommended the erection of a new eparchy, and it was approved by Pope John Paul II. The Eparchy of Van Nuys was canonically inaugurated on March 9, 1982, when Archbishop Stephen Kocisko, Metropolitan of the Metropolia of Pittsburgh enthroned Thomas Dolinay as the first bishop of the eparchy. Archbishop Pio Laghi, Apostolic Delegate to the United States, represented the Roman Pontiff and read the Papal Bulla creating the eparchy and appointing Dolinay. Cardinal Timothy Manning, Archbishop of Los Angeles delivered the homily. The Church of St. Mary in Sherman Oaks, California, was designated as the cathedral. In 1990, with the retirement of Archbishop Kocisko of Pittsburgh approaching, Pope John Paul II relieved Dolinay of his duties as Bishop of Van Nuys and appointed him Coadjutor Archbishop of the Byzantine Catholic Archeparchy of Pittsburgh on February 19, 1990.Thomas Dolinay bio sketch at Catholic- Hierarchy.org. Retrieved 2011-02-13. The Pope appointed the Auxiliary Bishop of Passaic, George M. Kuzma, to succeed Bishop Dolinay. After the Northridge earthquake of 1994 damaged the Cathedral of St. Mary, the eparchial offices, and the bishop's residence, Bishop Kuzma moved his office and residence to Phoenix, Arizona. On February 10, 2010, the seat of the diocese was officially changed to Phoenix. Accordingly, the former pro-cathedral of St. Stephen was given the title of Cathedral, and the Cathedral of St. Mary received the title of Proto-Cathedral.

The program was created by the CBC in association with Channel 4 Film. Ric Esther Bienstock was Series Producer and Writer. She also directed the China episode. The show focuses on street magic, and the subjects of each of the three shows are China (Chinese Linking Rings), India (Indian Rope Trick), and Egypt (Cups and Balls, Gali-Gali men). Unusually for Penn and Teller, Teller speaks in the Egypt episode, even though part of their trademark performance is that Penn does all the speaking. China This episode begins in Beijing, which, until the 1949 Revolution, had an extensive history of street magic. Modern day \\"street magic\\" is performed in teahouses. Besides the basic sleight of hand work (e.g. Cups and Balls), two tricks with historic ties are demonstrated. The first trick involves a man who produces various glass bowls filled with water from beneath a large robe. These bowls are of all shapes and sizes, often also contain flowers, and several are quite elaborate; one produced set is a stack of seven bowls of diminishing size. The second is a mask trick, known as Bian Lian, derived from Sichuan opera. The magician, in fractions of a second (the video is not fast enough to register the changes), alters the mask he wears. The performer has ten different masks, and also uses his normal face as a \\"mask\\" in the performance. Their next stop is an acrobatics school in Wuqiao, where a \\"master\\" is teaching a class of late-year students various basic tricks.http://english.cntv.cn/english/special/news/20100722/103635.shtml After their trip to the acrobatics school, a place where many of these students will end up is displayed: an empty (and unheated, even in the dead of winter) \\"Acrobatics World\\". The performers, be they acrobatics performers or magicians, perform quite admirably, for no audience (save Penn, Teller, and their camera crew). Finally, the duo proceed to Wanking, China, a small town in the hinterlands, where a great many residents perform some form of magic. When a family prepares to go to the town center to perform, Teller asks to perform a trick. India In India, where street magic is very alive, a family of street magicians take center stage. The tricks performed are of an exceptionally bloody nature; in one trick, a tongue is cut out. To befriend the magicians, Penn and Teller give them a stage knife that oozes blood. Several tricks demonstrated in this episode have injury of a family member as a theme. A magician performs the Basket Trick with his son. These forms of trick are seen as an inspiration for the alleged brutality of the Indian rope trick, where a small child, most likely the magician's son, is cut up and re- formed. A magician does, in fact, perform the Indian rope trick in front of the Taj Mahal; a rope does come out of a basket vertically, and a small child sent to climb it does so. However, the child is not injured or bloodied in any way. The brutal versions of the rope trick seem to have come from retelling. To show this, Penn and Teller set up a \\"performance\\" where a foreign couple enters the auditorium at the end of the trick, when the rope falls down and the child miraculously comes back to life. Rumors about the rope trick started spreading both within the local community and in England, when the couple returned home. Penn and Teller do feel that one of the actions of street magicians in India is unethical. At the end of the performances, the street magicians attempt to sell magic rings, which the magician represents as a source of good luck or power. Egypt In an Egyptian tomb, it is alleged that a 4,000-year-old hieroglyph depicts the Cups and balls trick. Penn and Teller go to Beni Hassan to see the tomb inscriptions. They decide the scene painted is not necessarily a cups and balls performance, but it might be. However, they see paintings of juggler performances in the same tomb. Penn notes he started his career as a juggler, before becoming a magician; and \\"jugglers always seem to arrive before magicians.\\" The majority of this episode is in search of the Gali-Gali men, a group of magicians with an extensive history made popular in the West by Luxor Gali-Gali. They film several Gali-Gali shows and visit the relatives of Luxor Gali-Gali. Luxor Gali-Gali's original cups, seen on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1949, are still in use by his descendants in Cairo. In this episode, Penn and Teller perform their particular version of the Cups and Balls in the tomb with the hieroglyphs using red and then clear plastic cups, concluding with the revelation of a potato.

It is the administrative headquarters of Bijawar Taluk, and was formerly the capital of a princely state of British India of the same name. The people of Bijawar are demanding the district status from their state government. History The native state of Bijawar covered an area of 2520 km2 (973 sq. m.) in the Bundelkhand Agency. Forests covered nearly half the total area of the state, which was believed to be rich in minerals, but lack of transport facilities had hindered the development of its resources. The state takes its name from the chief town, Bijawar, which was founded by Bijai Singh, one of the Gond chiefs of Garha Mandla, in the 17th century. The first ruler of the state was Bir Singh Deo (1765–93), a Bundela Rajput descended from the ruler of Orchha. It was conquered in the 18th century by Chhatarsal, the founder of Panna, a Rajput of the Bundela clan, by whose descendants it was held till its accession to India. It was confirmed to Ratan Singh in 1811 by the British government for the usual deed of allegiance. In 1857 Bhan Pratap Singh rendered signal services to the British during the Mutiny, being rewarded with certain privileges and a hereditary salute of eleven guns. In 1866 he received the title of Maharaja, and the prefix Sawai in 1877. Bhan Pratap was succeeded on his death in 1899 by his adopted son, Sanwant Singh, a son of the Maharaja of Orchha.Princely state - Bijawar The state acceded to India on 1 January 1950, and became part of the state of Vindhya Pradesh, which was merged into Madhya Pradesh on 1 November 1956. Bijawar is also known for Jatashankar, a holy place about 18 km from the town. Bijawar is also known for Janki Nibas Temple because it is similar to Ayodhya Temple. Another famous temple, Kanchan Temple, was built by Maharani Kanchan Kuwar of Bijawar. Maharani Kanchan Kuwar was born in Karahiya and Princes of Karahiya and was the daughter of H.H Rao Shahab of Karahiya. =Rulers= The rulers belonged to the Bundela dynasty.

In contrast to the fast block of polyspermy which immediately but temporarily blocks additional sperm from fertilizing the egg, the cortical reaction gradually establishes a permanent barrier to sperm entry and functions as the main part of the slow block of polyspermy in many animals. To create this barrier cortical granules, specialized secretory vesicles located within the egg's cortex (the region directly below the plasma membrane), are fused with the egg's plasma membrane, causing the contents of the cortical granules to be released outside the cell where they modify an existing extracellular matrix to make it impenetrable to sperm entry. The cortical granules contain proteases that clip perivitelline tether proteins, peroxidases that harden the vitelline envelope, and glycosaminoglycans that attract water into the perivitelline space, causing it to expand and form the hyaline layer. The trigger for the cortical granules to exocytose is the release of calcium ions from cortical smooth endoplasmic reticulum in response to sperm binding to the egg. In most animals, the extracellular matrix present around the egg is the vitelline envelope which becomes the fertilization membrane following the cortical reaction. In mammals, however, the extracellular matrix modified by the cortical reaction is the zona pellucida. This modification of the zona pellucida is known as the zona reaction. Although highly conserved across the animal kingdom, the cortical reaction shows great diversity between species. While much has been learned about the identity and function of the contents of the cortical granules in the highly accessible sea urchin, little is known about the contents of cortical granules in mammals. The cortical reaction within the egg is analogous to the acrosomal reaction within the sperm, where the acrosome, a specialized secretory vesicle that is homologous to cortical granules, is fused with the plasma membrane of the sperm cell to release its contents which degrade the egg's tough coating and allow the sperm to bind to and fuse with the egg. Echinoderms In the well-studied sea urchin model system, the granule contents modify a protein coat on the outside of the plasma membrane (the vitelline layer) so that it is released from the membrane. The released cortical granule proteins exert a colloid osmotic pressure causing water to enter the space between the plasma membrane and the vitelline layer, and the vitelline layer expands away from the egg surface. This is easily visible through a microscope and is known as \\"elevation of the fertilization envelope\\". Some of the former granule contents adhere to the fertilization envelope, and it is extensively modified and cross-linked. As the fertilization envelope elevates, non-fertilizing sperm are lifted away from the egg plasma membrane, and as they are not able to pass through the fertilization envelope, they are prevented from entering the egg. Therefore, the cortical reaction prevents polyspermic fertilization, a lethal event. Another cortical granule component, polysaccharide-rich hyalin, remains adherent to the outer surface of the plasma membrane, and becomes part of the hyaline layer. Mammals Although various mammals have been studied, mice represent the best studied animal models for understanding the cortical reaction in mammals. In mammals the cortical reaction leads to a modification of the zona pellucida that blocks polyspermy; enzymes released by cortical granules digest sperm receptor glycoproteins ZP2 and ZP3 so that they can no longer bind spermatozoon.

Slocum reached 100 wins faster than any other active coach. He has the best winning percentage in SWC history, one spot ahead of the legendary coach Darrell Royal who is number 2. Under his tenure, Slocum helped make A&M;'s Kyle Field one of the hardest places to play in the nation, only losing 12 home games in 14 years. They went parts of seven seasons without a home loss; after a loss to Texas Tech in October 1989, they would not lose again in College Station until late in 1995. With Miami's 58-game, nine-season home winning streak ending in 1994, A&M; owned the longest active home winning streak in the nation for much of 1994 and 1995.

In the Mughal era Balrampur was the seat of Balrampur Estate, a Taluqdari of Oudh. Geography Balrampur is located at . It has an average elevation of . Archaeological sites Two prominent archaeological sites, Jetavana and Savatthi, or Saheth and Maheth, as they are locally known, are located in the vicinity of Balrampur city. Alexander Cunningham used the ancient (6th century CE) accounts of Chinese pilgrim-monks to determine that Saheth-Maheth actually referred to Jetavana and Savatthi.Arch. Survey of India, 1907-8, pp.81-131 Saheth, covering an area of 32 acres, was the site of the Jetavana monastery. It became an important place of pilgrimage, adorned with numerous shrines, stupas and monasteries. The stupas belong mostly to the Kushan period, while the temples are in the Gupta style. The remains date from the Mauryan era (3rd century BCE) to the 12th century CE. One of the earliest stupas, contained relics of the Buddha. A colossal statue of the Buddha was also found here which is now preserved in the Indian Museum, Kolkata. Maheth covers an area of about , and has been identified with the remains of the city proper and is located about to the north-east of Saheth. Excavations have exposed the massive gates of the city, ramparts and also the ruins of other structures which testify to the prosperity of ancient Sravasti. The Sobhanath Temple is located here. The ruins of Maheth includes two stupas. One stupa, known as Pakki Kuti, is said to be that of Angulimala while the other, known as Kachchi Kuti, is believed to be that of Sudatta, a disciple of Buddha. Pakki Kuti and Kacchi Kuti were later converted into Brahmanical temples. The Emperor Ashoka visited Jetavana, and the Chinese pilgrim Hiuen- Tsang (Xuanzang) mentions two Ashokan pillars at Sravasti. Other places of interest include the Swarnagandha Kuti where Gautama Buddha lived. In Jetavana is also located the second-holiest tree of Buddhism: the Anandabodhi Tree.Jetavana Tourism and culture The district has very rich literary heritage. Famous Urdu poet Ali Sardar Jafri was born here in 1913. He is among the only four Urdu poets who got the prestigious Jnanpith award (other three are Firak Gorakhpuri, Kurtulain Hyder and Shaharyar). The other notable poet of the city is Syed Ali Mehdi Rizvi, very famous for his religious Urdu poetry such as Mussadas, Marsiya, Salam, Rubai and Nauha etc. Apart from extensively writing the religious poetry, his other notable works include poetic representation of History of India named \\"Matla- e-Watan\\" and translation of Bhagavad Gita in Urdu poetry.

Klein. The theatre cost $1.5 million to build, and opened on October 9, 1927. Interior Coronado Theatre lobby The theatre's elaborate auditorium is designed according to the atmospheric style popular in movie houses built in the 1920s. This style simulates an outdoor theater-going experience. The Coronado's auditorium walls are decorated with facades of gilded Spanish and Italian-style buildings, and the ceiling looks like a deep blue sky filled with twinkling stars and floating clouds. The auditorium is full of gilded detail. Green stained-glass lamps with fluted bulbs adorn the walls. Japanese dragons and glowing lanterns cover the organ screens on either side of the stage. Seating is on two levels, the main floor and a sizeable balcony. At the front of the theatre, in front and below the stage is an orchestra pit. Incorporated into the gilded sides of the interior of the theatre hall are several alcoves that resemble box seats along the sides, which can be accessed from the balcony level but usually do not have seats. All seats are covered with plush red velvet. The lobby and mezzanine level are as elaborately designed as the auditorium. One of the grand mezzanine's focal points is a statue of Venus standing in front of a golden seashell. Because of its breathtaking interior design, the Coronado is sentimentally referred to as \\"Rockford's Wonder Theatre.\\" Events During its early years, the Coronado played host to both movies and live stage shows. Its opening show was a silent film called \\"Swim Girl Swim.\\" Nearly 9,000 people flocked to the three opening-day showings. During the theatre's heyday which lasted from its opening until the 1960s, such famous stage acts as Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Bob Hope, Sammy Davis Jr. & Milton Berle appeared at the Coronado. During his 1960 Presidential campaign, John F. Kennedy made a stop there. In 1984, the Coronado ceased showing movies because of a decline in revenue. In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, the Coronado Theatre was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component (AIA Illinois). National landmark In 1979, the Coronado was added to the National Register of Historic Places. At the dedication ceremony, it was referred to as one of the premiere theaters of its kind in the nation. In 1980, the City of Rockford made the Coronado an historical landmark of the state of Illinois. On 1 July 2010, the Coronado Theater was voted \\"the No. 1 Architectural Wonder of the United States, based on receiving the most votes in an AOL/U.S. Travel Association poll. It finished with 6,511 votes (30 percent), while the Government Bridge in Rock Island was second at 3,816 (17.6 percent). The 250-room Biltmore residence in Ashville, N.C., was third at 2,781.\\" Rockford Register Star, \\"Rockford's Coronado wins national architectural contest by landslide\\" By Georgette Braun 01 July 2010 Restoration project Kerasotes Theater Organization, owner of the Coronado Theatre since 1970, donated the property to the City of Rockford in 1997. Plans to preserve and renovate the theater followed immediately. The Friends of the Coronado, founded in 1998, began an $18.5 million restoration project a year later. Rockford community members supported the restoration by donating nearly half of the required funds. The project's goals were both to restore the theater's deteriorating interior and bring the building structure up-to-date. The restoration project not only preserved the existing features of the theater, it also provided the theater with more usable space. Additionally, the Coronado is now a fully handicapped accessible building. After 18 months of construction, the Coronado reopened in 2001 with a black- tie celebration. Grand Barton Organ The Coronado is home to one of only two remaining Grand Barton Theater Organs that feature a unique dragon design. The organ is a 4 manual, 17 rank instrument that features many of the common stops that came with theater organs of the day such as bird calls, car horns, and other sounds necessary to add substance in the silent movie age. The Organ is under the care of the Land of Lincoln Theater Organ Society, which offers year-round tours and demonstrations. Today The Coronado has always been a source of pride for Rockford citizens. Today, the Coronado combines completely modern amenities with its original 1920s decor. With more backstage area and added dressing-rooms, the Coronado now plays host to large traveling theater companies and famous headlining acts. The expanded lobby space accommodates the increased number of theater-goers that attend concerts and events held on a regular basis.

Implementation specifics Doctest makes innovative use of the following Python capabilities:docstring-driven testing * docstrings * The Python interactive shell (both command line and the included idle application) * Python introspection When using the Python shell, the primary prompt: >>> , is followed by new commands. The secondary prompt: ... , is used when continuing commands on multiple lines; and the result of executing the command is expected on following lines. A blank line, or another line starting with the primary prompt is seen as the end of the output from the command. The doctest module looks for such sequences of prompts in a docstring, re-executes the extracted command and checks the output against the output of the command given in the docstrings test example. The default action when running doctests is for no output to be shown when tests pass. This can be modified by options to the doctest runner. In addition, doctest has been integrated with the Python unit test module allowing doctests to be run as standard unittest testcases. Unittest testcase runners allow more options when running tests such as the reporting of test statistics such as tests passed, and failed. Literate programming and doctests Although doctest does not allow a Python program to be embedded in narrative text, it does allow for verifiable examples to be embedded in docstrings, where the docstrings can contain other text. Docstrings can in turn be extracted from program files to generate documentation in other formats such as HTML or PDF. A program file can be made to contain the documentation, tests, as well as the code and the tests easily verified against the code. This allows code, tests, and documentation to evolve together. Documenting libraries by example Doctests are well suited to provide an introduction to a library by demonstrating how the API is used. On the basis of the output of Python's interactive interpreter, text can be mixed with tests that exercise the library, showing expected results. Examples Example one shows how narrative text can be interspersed with testable examples in a docstring. In the second example, more features of doctest are shown, together with their explanation. Example three is set up to run all doctests in a file when the file is run, but when imported as a module, the tests will not be run. = Example 1: A doctest embedded in the docstring of a function = def list_to_0_index(lst): \\"\\"\\"A solution to the problem given in: https://rgrig.blogspot.com/2005/11/writing-readable- code.html 'Given a list, lst, say for each element the 0-index where it appears for the first time. So the list x = [0, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 0, 2] is transformed into y = [0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3]. Notice that for all i we have x[y[i = x[i]. Use any programming language and any data representation you want.' >>> x = [0, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 0, 2] >>> list_to_0_index(x) [0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 3] >>> \\"\\"\\" return [lst.index(i) for i in lst] = Example 2: doctests embedded in a README.txt file =  Demonstration doctests  This is just an example of what a README text looks like that can be used with the doctest.DocFileSuite() function from Python's doctest module. Normally, the README file would explain the API of the module, like this: >>> a = 1 >>> b = 2 >>> a + b 3 Notice, that we just demonstrated how to add two numbers in Python, and what the result will look like. A special option allows you to be somewhat fuzzy about your examples: >>> o = object() >>> o # doctest: +ELLIPSIS Exceptions can be tested very nicely too: >>> x Traceback (most recent call last): ... NameError: name 'x' is not defined = Example 3: unique_words.py = This example also simulates input to the function from a file by using the Python StringIO module def unique_words(page): Return set of the unique words in list of lines of text. Example: >>> from StringIO import StringIO >>> fileText = \\"\\"\\"the cat sat on the mat ... the mat was ondur the cat ... one fish two fish red fish ... blue fish ... This fish has a yellow car ... This fish has a yellow star\\"\\"\\" >>> file = StringIO(fileText) >>> page = file.readlines() >>> words = unique_words(page) >>> print sorted(list(words)) [\\"This\\", \\"a\\", \\"blue\\", \\"car\\", \\"cat\\", \\"fish\\", \\"has\\", \\"mat\\", \\"on\\", \\"ondur\\", \\"one\\", \\"red\\", \\"sat\\", \\"star\\", \\"the\\", \\"two\\", \\"was\\", \\"yellow\\"] >>> ''' return set(word for line in page for word in line.split()) def _test(): import doctest doctest.testmod() if __name__  \\"__main__\\": _test()  Doctest and documentation generators  Both the EpyText format of Epydoc and Docutils' reStructuredText format support the markup of doctest sections within docstrings.

The theater taught and hosted performances of improvisational comedy. It was founded in 1981 by Del Close and Charna Halpern. The theater had many notable alumni, including Amy Poehler and Stephen Colbert. Description iO concentrated on \\"long-form\\" improvisational structures, in contrast to the \\"short-form\\" or \\"improv game\\" format of Theatresports, ComedySportz or the television show Whose Line Is It Anyway? The iO's signature piece was the \\"Harold\\", and the theater featured other forms of improvisation, as well as sketch comedy and stand-up comedy. The building had four performance spaces: * The Del Close Theater - This was the second-largest of iO's theaters, and was located on the ground floor of the building. It hosted some of iO's premiere shows, such as Virgin Daiquiri, The Improvised Shakespeare Company, and The Deltones. * The Chris Farley Cabaret - One of two cabaret-style theaters in the building, this hosted many different types of performances, mostly improvised and mostly non- Harold. * The Jason Chin Harold Cabaret - Named after a revered teacher at iO who died on January 8, 2015, this theater predominantly featured performances of the Harold from house teams at the theater which specialized in that form. * The Mission Theater - The largest theater at iO, formerly run and managed by T. J. Jagodowski and David Pasquesi, or \\"TJ and Dave\\", featured some of iO's most iconic and longest-running shows such as The Armando Diaz Theatrical Experience and Hootenanny, The Musical Armando, and Whirled News Tonight. History The ImprovOlympic was created in 1981 putting competing teams of comedic improvisers on stage in front of audiences. This was the brainchild of David Shepherd who originally created the format in 1972 in New York with Howard Jerome. David Shepherd used the Theater Games, created earlier by Viola Spolin, as a way for teams to compete. The first ImprovOlympic classes and shows took place at The Players Workshop in Chicago, where Charna Halpern was an improv student. Charna Halpern became David Shepherd's assistant, and eventually the producer of the competitions. There were also competitions at a network of local bars and clubs. In 1982, The ImprovOlympic moved from The Players Workshop to its own space. Teams began to form out of every major improv troupe in Chicago. Shows began shifting to a long-form approach by 1983. In 1995, The ImprovOlympic moved to its location on Clark St. in Chicago. An additional theater, iO West was opened by Paul Vaillancourt in Los Angeles, California in 1997. Today it is managed by Colleen Doyle and Zach Huddleston. In 2001, The International Olympic Committee legally threatened the theater over its use of the name \\"ImprovOlympic\\" and the name was subsequently changed to \\"iO.\\" On September 2, 2005, iO held its 25th anniversary show at the Chicago Theatre in downtown Chicago. The wireless microphones went dead shortly into the show, but the improvisers rallied and played using wired mics for the rest of the performance. Celebrity veterans of the iO program who returned to play included Mike Myers, Tim Meadows, Amy Poehler, and Ike Barinholtz. The opening to the Harold piece performed was conducted by the most veteran iO house team \\"The Reckoning.\\" In August 2014, after almost 20 years in Chicago's Wrigleyville neighborhood, Charna Halpern bought a building in the Lincoln Park neighborhood and moved the iO Theater to its new home at 1501 N. Kingsbury St. On June 18, 2020, it was announced that iO would be closing permanently. Controversy ensued regarding whether the closure was due to financial difficulties or allegations of racism that had emerged in the form of an online petition that began circulating only a few days before.https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/chris- jones/ct-ent-chicago-io-improv-theater- petition-20200611-yyqmy6yybfen3lo6njmh7tyy4y-story.html Notable alumni This includes people who have performed or taught at either iO West or iO Chicago: *Stephen Colbert *Chris Farley *Tina Fey *Kate Flannery *Bill Hader *Seth Meyers *Mike Myers *Amy Poehler *Jason Sudeikis *Vince Vaughn *Bob Odenkirk *Scott Adsit *Vanessa Bayer *Matt Besser *Maria Blasuccihttp://ioimprov.com/west/festivals/scripted-comedy- festival/panels/maria-blasucci/ *Paul BrittainMoynihan, Rob.

The long river begins at the confluence of two rivers: Nisserelva and Fyreselv. The confluence is located by the village of Haugsjåsund in Nissedal municipality in southern Vestfold og Telemark county. The river flows south into the Skagerrak at the city of Arendal. The watershed covers and has an average waterflow of at Rykene near the mouth. The highest waterflow ever recorded on the river was in the autumn of 1987. Watercourse The river flows through Nissedal in Vestfold og Telemark county briefly before entering Agder county. It then flows through Åmli municipality. The river Gjøv joins the Nidelva there. The large lake Nelaug is a man-made lake along the river that is used for power generation. It continues through Froland municipality and then Arendal municipality. For a while, the river forms the border between Grimstad and Arendal municipalities. The river empties into the Skaggerak just northeast of Rykene in the town of Arendal between the mainland and the island of Hisøya. There are sixteen hydro-electric power stations are built along the river, making this one of Norway's most controlled drainage systems. The largest on the river are at Rygene in Grimstad, Evenstad in Froland, and Jørundland in Åmli. Salmon can be found from the mouth to as far as up the river, where the Evenstad power station is located, effectively blocking their path further upstream. Name The name of the river possibly comes from the Old Norse word niðr which means \\"the river that is lying down\\". It may also come from the Latin word nitere. The name of the river also may lend itself to several other local names along the river such as Nisser, Nedenes, and Nelaug.

In his ministry in the early 1960s, Sam Fife used elements of charismatic ministry, first at his church in New Orleans, then in his prayer group in Miami, Florida. He was a former Baptist preacher and his theology has been compared to that of the Body of Christ movement.Rudin, A. James & Marcia R. Rudin (1980). Prison or Paradise: The New Religious Cults, Philadelphia: Fortress Press. pp. 72–73 At a time of searching by young people and social disruption, Fife's teachings inspired groups throughout the United States, Canada and, later, other countries. Considered by some to be an apostle, under the concept of the Fivefold ministry, Fife attracted a group of ministers who believed his vision of the role of the church in the \\"end times\\". In the fall 1971, Fife began to preach what was referred to as the \\"Wilderness Message.\\" Within a few years, thousands of his followers had moved to a number of communal farms, mostly in Alaska, Canada, and Colombia.\\"Samuel Fife and the Move of God\\", Iglesia de Jesus en La Linea Website, Nuevo Pacto They followed various practices in combining their resources in common. Sam Fife wrote numerous booklets about his beliefs, which were distributed among members of The Move.

He assured people that he would never die but was in the process of being changed into an incorruptible life.\\" Following Fife's death, his teachings were carried on by other ministers in The Move, notably C.E. \\"Buddy\\" Cobb. In 1982, Cobb and others founded Covenant Life College, with sites in Georgia, Alaska, and Canada. In the first decades of the 21st century, The Move's traveling ministers operate under the name International Ministerial Association (IMA). Small groups of The Move continue to operate in rural areas as well as in many cities throughout the US and other countries, but their numbers have declined since the late 1990s. History The number of people involved in The Move has been in a long, slow decline, which began in the early 1980s with the closing of some Move farms in British Columbia (BC), Canada. In the early 1990s, by contrast, farms in northern BC attracted new members, or groups set up new sites, with some of the communes numbering over 100 people, many of them youth. Don Murphy, a Hutterite, reported on visiting Blueberry Farm in January 1994, where 140 adherents of the late Sam Fife's teachings ran a community. He noted that the community's members gave half of their income to it and generally dressed conservatively. Members needed the leaders' permission to go into town, even if they were using their own cars. He was favorably impressed by the outlook and spiritual vitality of the communities in British Columbia, writing, \\"It seems to me that these people probably are like the Hutterites were at the time of Jacob Hutter and Peter Reidemann - very strong in faith and close to God.\\" He faulted them for not adhering more strictly to New Testament rules about divorce and women's roles.Don Murphy (January 1994). \\"Canada Journal,\\" The Anabaptist Voice, Anabaptist Church The apparent revival lasted about ten years, before people began to leave again in the late 1990s. Since then, some of the farms have closed, some are reduced in population, and some thrive. Some ex-members have criticized The Move, and reported suffering physical, sexual and psychological abuse at the hands of its leaders and elders while they were still involved with this group. More than 300 people formerly associated with The Move and a similar group, I'SOT, have traded stories in the Sam Fife/Move Yahoo! Group started in 2005. The forum has provided a venue for considerable discussion of widely varied views and experiences within the Move. Four members wrote an open letter to the ministry of The Move, which they published on the Internet in order to publicize the abuses that allegedly had occurred there.\\"Letter to Move Leadership\\", ISOT Survivors Many other members claim to have endured long-term social, psychological, and spiritual damage, usually stemming from the Move's teachings of complete submission to leadership, whose members have sometimes created an impure and corrupt system. Reports have been made of financial exploitation in the form of work without pay and encouragement for members to turn over life savings to The Move. Some critics and former members have characterized the Move as a cult. Teachings The Move's teachings gradually changed. As one observer said, \\"Alongside that word was a revelation of 'Christ in you,' with a vision of overcoming all things, but through the last several years before I left that fellowship, 'doing what He says' had triumphed over 'Christ revealed in us.'\\"Yordy, Daniel (2009). \\"Weakness Versus Pretending\\". Christ Our Life. The Jesus Secret Society ='Divine Order' teaching= Sam Fife's vision and teaching on what he called Divine Order became the guiding principle that characterized the Move's authority structure.Priebe, Ed (1992). \\"Hearing From God\\". Sword of the Lord Ministries. Note: Priebe quotes from a booklet, \\"Unmasking the Move\\" by Jack Enlow He wrote the following in explication: > \\"This is ... the move of God in which God is bringing forth a many-membered > manchild to govern the world, through whom Christ will govern the world > during the millennium that is to come. Therefore, we are in God's school of > Divine Government, and God is training us as one many-membered man, teaching > us, training us, preparing us to be the government through whom the Spirit > of Christ will govern the world. The way that he is teaching us and training > us is by letting us practice on one another, by teaching us to govern one > another and to be governed by one another after the order of Melchisedec, > which is a theocratic spirit government order.\\"Fife, Sam; \\"God's School of > Divine Government;\\" Miami, 1974, pp. 1, 3-4 \\"Now that governmental order, at this point, is a five fold spirit ministry governmental order consisting of apostles, prophets, evangelists, elders or pastors (those two terms are synonymous) and teachers.\\" > \\"What God wants...is a group of elders to be His government that can > disagree with one another, but in the right spirit , the humble sweet > gracious Spirit of Christ and in the divine order that God has established > for disagreeing with one another and thereby be one another's perfect check > and balance.\\" =Doctrine of Sinless Perfection= After Fife's death in a plane crash 1979, Buddy Cobb (1925 - 2017) led the group. He developed the concept that the goal of the Christian is a life of \\"sinless perfection.\\" According to Cobb, this place of Christian maturity is attainable only through a growing personal relationship with God the Father. When one begins hearing God's voice, and following his counsel, sanctification and holiness grow in the believer's life. Cobb stressed that believers will be saved by his (Christ's) life, as expounded in the teaching \\"Dead to Sin\\": > \\"Therefore, what are you saved by? His life! What are you saved from by His > life? Saved from living your own life and when you live your own life you > are always living in sin. There is only one way to get out of sin, that is > to get into His life.

Since it is on the basis of grace, > it is not on the basis of works. That is a bunch of baloney. The truth is, > that you will never be saved but by total obedience to God.\\" Culture Following a doctrine of separation from the world, women in the Move traditionally have worn dresses or skirts. Most men kept their hair short and shaved off facial hair.Todd, Douglas; \\"Peace River Commune Awaits Imminent Apocalypse: Christian Community\\"; The Vancouver Sun; September 22, 2003; p. B1. Reprinted 27 Oct. 2016. This was a common practice among most Move communes until after the year 2000. Another practice now discarded is \\"walking a year,\\" a concept that is similar to that of courtship. The couple is not allowed to be physically affectionate or hold hands, or spend time alone together. At the end of a year, if the couple wants to marry and the elders approve and confirm the match with visions from the prophetic ministry, the couple may proceed to marry. The details of the rules vary from farm to farm. Members who do not live on the communal farms often congregate in groups, numbering from a half dozen to several dozen people, and they sometimes hold meetings in people's houses. Such regular small meetings are punctuated by large gatherings which are called Conventions, which are held several times a year. At these conventions, several hundred people meet for several days in order to praise and worship God, and listen to the preaching of the elders in the traveling ministry. The traveling ministry consists of elders who travel from group to group and from convention to convention, with special messages. They are often highly respected by the rest of the community's members, while community elders are the day-to-day leaders of the groups. Conventions have been held in Bowen's Mill, Georgia; Lubbock, Texas; Shepherd's Inn, British Columbia; Upsala, Ontario, and various other locations throughout the world. Criticism Critics say that, although the Move teaches that everyone is free to hear from and be led by God, in practice, the actions of its members must be approved by the local ministry. They believe that in practice, members must submit to the rules of the local ministry or be labelled divisive and rebellious.[7] Former group member, Vennie Kocsis, related her experiences growing up on two separate compounds after her mother was lured into the group in 1973. Her discussion aired on a May 12, 2019 radio interview on the \\"Coast to Coast AM\\" radio program. Vennie's mother was sent along with the children to one of the group's demon deliverance compounds in Massachusetts where she lived for four years. They were then moved up to the interior of Alaska. https://www.coasttocoastam.com/show/2019/05/12 Kocsis states that leaders and members subjected her and other children to child labor, neglect, beatings, and for some children, even sexual molestation.

She supported Japanese forces during the invasion of Malaya in December 1941 and was instrumental in tracking Force Z, the two British capital ships that attempted to intercept the Japanese invasion forces, so they could be sunk by torpedo bombers. The boat sank a few Dutch merchant ships in early 1942 during the Dutch East Indies campaign and was then was transferred to the Central Pacific in May to support the fleet during the Battle of Midway in early June. Upon her return to Japan the following month, she became a training ship until early 1945 when she was modified to serve as a carrier for Kaiten manned torpedoes. I-158 survived the war to be scuttled in 1946. Design and description The submarines of the KD3A sub-class were the first Japanese- designed cruiser submarines, based on experience with earlier designs based on British and German cruiser submarines.Jentschura, Jung & Mickel, p. 170 They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of . The boats had a diving depth of and a complement of 60 officers and crewmen.Carpenter & Polmar, p. 93 For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater. On the surface, the KD3As had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at .Chesneau, p. 198 The boats were armed with eight internal torpedo tubes, six in the bow and two in the stern. They carried one reload for each tube; a total of 16 torpedoes. They were also armed with one deck gun for combat on the surface.Bagnasco, p. 183 Construction and career I-58 at sea, 1927 Built by the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, I-58 was launched on 3 October 1925 and completed on 15 May 1928. In November 1941, the boat was assigned to the 19th Submarine Division of the 4th Submarine Squadron. The division departed its base at Samah on Hainan Island, China on 1 December for their patrol area off Trengganu, Malaysia.Hackett & Kingsepp During the invasion of Malaya on 8 December, I-58 and four other submarines formed a patrol line searching for Allied ships. The following day, spotted the British ships of Force Z, the battleship and the battlecruiser , escorted by four destroyers, headed north-northwest. Shortly after midnight on 10 December, east of Kuantan, Malaya, I-58 was running on the surface when her lookouts spotted Force Z 600 meters (656 yards) away. After crash diving, Lieutenant Commander Kitamura attempted to fire a full six-torpedo salvo at Prince of Wales in the lead, but his first torpedo tube's outer door jammed. Kitamura fired his five available torpedoes at Repulse, but missed. He reported that Force Z was proceeding south-southwest at and continued to track the British ships. The report was received by the light cruiser which relayed it to Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa's flagship, the heavy cruiser . At 06:15, I-58 lost contact with Force Z. That afternoon, both British capital ships were sunk by torpedo bombers of the 22nd Air Flotilla from bases in French Indochina. The boat arrived at Cam Ranh Bay, French Indochina, to resupply on 20 December and sortied again on the 28th to patrol the area around Surabaya in the Dutch East Indies. At 01:45 on 3 January 1942, northwest of Bawean Island, I-58 attacked the Dutch cargo ship ; she was immobilized by a torpedo hit in the engine room and sunk by gunfire. The surviving crew of about 90 crewmen abandoned ship, but were machine-gunned by I-58. Three survivors were rescued, interrogated by Kitamura, and then thrown back into the sea where they spent four or five days on a raft they found before they reached land. Six days later, the boat sank the Dutch freighter at ; the survivors were rescued by the American destroyer . On her next patrol, I-58 sank the Dutch passenger ship on 22 February between Tjilatjap and Padang. Three days later, the boat sank the Dutch merchant ship in the Java Sea, south of the Sunda Strait. On 28 February, I-58 torpedoed, but did not sink, the British tanker south of the Sunda Strait. The boat returned to Japan on 20 March and was renumbered as I-158 on 20 May. She arrived at Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands on 24 May in preparation for Operation MI, the Japanese plan to occupy Midway Atoll. I-158 sortied two days later in a fruitless attempt to intercept American ships reacting to the Japanese invasion and played no significant part in the Battle of Midway. She returned to Japan on 30 June and was assigned as a training ship for the Kure Submarine School on 10 July. The boat was slightly damaged during an air raid on the Mitsubushi dockyard at Kobe on 17 March 1945. While under repair, I-158 was converted into a mother ship for a pair of Kaiten suicide submarines. She was struck from the Navy List on 30 November 1945 and scuttled off the Gotō Islands on 1 April 1946.

It is preceded by only a few fragmentary texts existing in Old Dutch, and it was succeeded by Dutch Renaissance and Golden Age literature. Early stages In the first stages of Dutch literature, poetry was the predominant form of literary expression. In the Low Countries as in the rest of Europe, courtly romance and poetry were popular genres during the Middle Ages. The chivalric epic was a popular genre as well, often featuring King Arthur or Charlemagne (Karel) as protagonist (with notable example of Karel ende Elegast, Dutch for \\"Charlemagne and the elf-spirit/elf-guest\\"). Henric van Veldeke.The first Dutch language writer known by name is the 12th-century County of Loon poet Henric van Veldeke, an early contemporary of Walther von der Vogelweide. Van Veldeke wrote courtly love poetry, a hagiography of Saint Servatius and an epic retelling of the Aeneid in a Limburgish dialect that straddles the Dutch- German language boundary. A number of the surviving epic works, especially the courtly romances, were copies from or expansions of earlier German or French efforts, but there are examples of truly original works (such as the anonymously written Karel ende Elegast) and original Dutch-language works that were translated into other languages (notable Dutch morality play Elckerlijc formed the basis for the English play Everyman). Apart from ancient tales embedded in Dutch folk songs, virtually no genuine folk-tales of Dutch antiquity have come down to us, and scarcely any echoes of Germanic myth. On the other hand, the sagas of Charlemagne and Arthur appear immediately in Middle Dutch forms. These were evidently introduced by wandering minstrels and translated to gratify the curiosity of the noble women. It is rarely that the name of such a translator has reached us. The Chanson de Roland was translated somewhere in the twelfth century, and the Flemish minstrel Diederic van Assenede completed his version of Floris and Blancheflour as Floris ende Blancefloer around 1260. The Arthurian legends appear to have been brought to Flanders by some Flemish colonists in Wales, on their return to their mother country. Around 1250 a Brabantine minstrel translated the Prose Lancelot at the command of his liege, Lodewijk van Velthem. This adaptation, known as the Lancelot-Compilatie, contains many differences from the French original, and includes a number of episodes that were probably originally separate romances. Some of these are themselves translations of French originals, but others, such as the Morien, seem to be originals. The Gauvain was translated by Penninc and Vostaert as Roman van Walewijn before 1260, while the first wholly original Dutch epic writer, Jacob van Maerlant, occupied himself around 1260 with several romances dealing with Merlin and the Holy Grail. The earliest existing fragments of the epic of Reynard the Fox were written in Latin by Flemish priests, and about 1250 the first part of a very important version in Dutch, Vanden vos Reynaerde (\\"Of Reynard\\") was made by Willem. In his existing work the author follows Pierre de Saint-Cloud, but not slavishly; and he is the first really admirable writer that we meet with in Dutch literature. The second part was added by another poet, Aernout, of whom we know little else either. The first lyrical writer of the Low Countries was John I, Duke of Brabant, who practised the minnelied with success. In 1544 the earliest collection of Dutch folk-songs saw the light, and in this volume one or two romances of the fourteenth century are preserved, of which \\"Het Daghet in den Oosten\\" is the best known. Almost the earliest fragment of Dutch popular poetry, but of later time, is an historical ballad describing the murder of Floris V, Count of Holland in 1296. A very curious collection of mystical lyrics and songs by Hadewijch, a Brabantine Beguine, was first printed in 1875. Up until now, the Middle Dutch language output mainly serviced the aristocratic and monastic orders, recording the traditions of chivalry and of religion, but scarcely addressed the bulk of the population. With the close of the thirteenth century a change came over the face of Dutch literature. The Dutch towns began to prosper and to assert their commercial supremacy over the North Sea. Under such mild rulers as William II and Floris V, Dordrecht, Amsterdam and other cities won privileges amounting almost to political independence, and with this liberty there arose a new sort of literary expression. Influential writers Jacob van Maerlant.The founder and creator of this original Dutch literature was Jacob van Maerlant. His Der Naturen Bloeme (\\"The Flower of Nature\\"), written about 1263, takes an important place in early Dutch literature. It is a collection of moral and satirical addresses to all classes of society. With his Rijmbijbel (\\"Verse Bible\\") he foreshadowed the courage and free-thought of the Reformation. It was not until 1284 that he began his masterpiece, De Spieghel Historiael (\\"The Mirror of History\\") at the command of Count Floris V. In the northern provinces, an equally great talent was exhibited by Melis Stoke, a monk of Egmond, who wrote the history of the state of Holland to the year 1305; his work, the Rijmkroniek (\\"Verse Chronicle\\"), was printed in 1591 and for its exactitude and minute detail it has proved of inestimable service to later historians. Chivalric era With the middle of the fourteenth century the chivalric spirit came once more into fashion. A certain revival of the forms of feudal life made its appearance under William III and his successors. Knightly romances came once more into vogue, but the newborn didactic poetry contended vigorously against the supremacy of what was lyrical and epical. From the very first the literary spirit in the Low Countries began to assert itself in a homely and utilitarian spirit. Thoroughly aristocratic in feeling was Hem van Aken, a priest of Louvain, who lived about 1255–1330, and who combined to a very curious extent the romantic and didactic elements prevailing at the time. As early as 1280 he had completed his translation of the Roman de la Rose, which he must have commenced in the lifetime of its author Jean de Meung. During the Bavarian period (1349–1433), very little original writing of much value was produced in Holland. Towards the end of the 14th century, an erotic poet of considerable power arose in the person of the lord of Waddinxveen, Dirc Potter van der Loo (c. 1365–1428), who was secretary at the court of the counts of Holland. During an embassy in Rome, this eminent diplomat made himself acquainted with the writings of Giovanni Boccaccio and commenced a vast poem, Der Minnen Loep (\\"The Course of Love\\"), a mixture of classical and Biblical instances of amorous adventures set in a framework of didactic philosophy. In Potter, the last traces of the chivalric element died out of Dutch literature, and poetry was left entirely in the hands of the school of Maerlant. Drama As in most European nations, the religious drama takes a prominent place in a survey of medieval literature in the Low Countries. The earliest existing fragment is part of a Maastricht Passover Play of about 1360. There is also a Holy Sacrament, composed by a certain Smeken at Breda and performed in 1500. In addition to these purely theological dramas there were acted mundane plays and farces, performed outside the churches by semi-religious companies; these curious moralities were known as Abele Spelen (\\"Worthy Plays\\") and Sotternien (\\"Silly Plays\\"). In these pieces we discover the first traces of that genius for low comedy which was afterwards further developed in the dramas of Bredero and the paintings of Teniers. Prose Jan van Ruusbroec.As for prose, the oldest pieces of Dutch prose now in existence are charters of towns in Flanders and Zeeland, dated 1249, 1251 and 1254. Beatrice of Nazareth (1200–1268) was the first known prose writer in the Dutch language, the author of the notable treatise known as the Seven Ways of Holy Love. From the other Dutch mystics whose writings have reached us, the Brussels friar Jan van Ruusbroec (better known in English as the Blessed John of Ruysbroeck, 1293/4–1381), the \\"father of Dutch prose\\" stands out. A prose translation of the Old Testament was made about 1300, and there exists a Life of Jesus of around the same date. Interesting relics of medieval Dutch narrative, as far as the formation of the language is concerned, are the popular romances in which the romantic stories of the minstrels were translated for the benefit of the unlettered public into simple language. Guilds The poets of the Low Countries had already discovered in late medieval times the value of guilds in promoting the arts and industrial handicrafts. The term \\"Collèges de Rhétorique\\" (\\"Chambers of Rhetoric\\") is supposed to have been introduced around 1440 to the courtiers of the Burgundian dynasty, but the institutions themselves existed long before. These literary guilds, whose members called themselves \\"Rederijkers\\" or \\"Rhetoricians\\", lasted until the end of the sixteenth century and during the greater part of that time preserved a completely medieval character, even when the influences of the Renaissance and the Reformation obliged them to modify in some degree their outward forms. They were in almost all cases absolutely middle class in tone, and opposed to aristocratic ideas and tendencies in thought. Of these chambers, the earliest were almost entirely engaged in preparing mysteries and miracle plays for the people. The most celebrated of all the chambers, that of the Eglantine at Amsterdam, with its motto \\"In Liefde Bloeyende\\" (\\"Blossoming in Love\\"), was not instituted until 1496. And not in the Low Countries' important places only, but in almost every little town, the rhetoricians exerted their influence, mainly in what we may call a social direction. Their wealth was in most cases considerable, and it very soon became evident that no festival or procession could take place in a town unless the Chamber patronized it. Towards the end of the fifteenth century, the Ghent chamber began to exercise a sovereign power over the other Flemish chambers, which was emulated later on in Holland by the Eglantine at Amsterdam. But this official recognition proved of no consequence in literature and it was not in Ghent but in Antwerp that intellectual life first began to stir. In Holland the burghers only formed the chambers, while in Flanders the representatives of the noble families were honorary members, and assisted with their money at the arrangement of ecclesiastical or political pageants. Their Landjuwelen, or Tournaments of Rhetoric, at which rich prizes were awarded, were the occasions upon which the members of the chambers distinguished themselves. Between 1426 and 1620, at least 66 of these festivals were held. The grandest of all was the festival celebrated at Antwerp on August 3, 1561. The Brussels chamber sent 340 members, all on horseback and clad in crimson mantles. The town of Antwerp gave a ton of gold to be given in prizes, which were shared among 1,893 rhetoricians. This was the zenith of the splendour of the chambers, and after this time they soon fell into disfavour. Farce Their dramatic pieces produced by the chambers were of a didactic cast, with a strong farcical flavour, and continued the tradition of Maerlant and his school. They very rarely dealt with historical or even Biblical personages, but entirely with allegorical and moral abstractions. The most notable examples of Rederijker theatre include Mariken van Nieumeghen (\\"Mary of Nijmegen\\") and Elckerlijc (which was translated into English as Everyman). Of the pure farces of the rhetorical chambers we can speak with still more confidence, for some of them have come down to us, and among the authors famed for their skill in this sort of writing are named Cornelis Everaert of Bruges and Laurens Janssen of Haarlem. The material of these farces is extremely raw, consisting of rough jests at the expense of priests and foolish husbands, silly old men and their light wives. The chambers also encouraged the composition of songs, but with very little success; they produced no lyrical genius more considerable than Matthijs de Casteleyn (1488–1550) of Oudenaarde, author of De Conste van Rhetorijcken (\\"The Art of Rhetoric\\"). Anna Bijns Title page of Anna Bijns' first volume of Refereinen (1528). Early Modern Dutch literature might be said to begin with Anna Bijns (c. 1494–1575). Bijns, who is believed to have been born at Antwerp in 1494, was a schoolmistress at that city in her middle life, and in old age she still instructed youth in the Catholic religion. She died on April 10, 1575. From her work we know that she was a lay nun, that and she occupied a position of honour and influence at Antwerp. Bijns' main target were the faith and character of Luther. In her first volume of poetry (1528) the Lutherans are scarcely mentioned and focus lies on her personal experience of faith, but in that of 1538 every page is occupied with invectives against them. All the poems of Anna Bijns still extant are of the form called refereinen (refrains). Her mastery over verse form is considered remarkable. With the writings of Anna Bijns, the period of Middle Dutch closes and modern Dutch begins. See also * Dutch folklore * Van Hulthem Manuscript Sources *Meijer, Reinder.

The icefield is the source of many glaciers including the Mendenhall Glacier and the Taku Glacier. The icefield is home to over 40 large valley glaciers and 100 smaller ones. The Icefield serves as a tourist attraction with many travellers flown in by helicopter for quick walks on the deep ice and the massive, awe-inspiring moist crevasses. The icefield, like many of its glaciers, reached its maximum glaciation point around 1700 and has been in retreat since. In fact, of the icefield's 19 notable glaciers, the Taku Glacier is the only one presently advancing. Much of the icefield is contained within the Tongass National Forest. Since 1948, the Juneau Icefield Research Program has monitored glaciers of the Juneau Icefield. On the west side of the icefield, from 1946-2009, the terminus of the Mendenhall Glacier has retreated over .Locational map of major features of the Alaska Panhandle area including the Juneau Icefield in the northern portion Eight kilometers to the north, the Herbert Glacier has retreated , while Eagle Glacier retreated , Gilkey Glacier and Llewellyn Glacier . On the south side of the icefield, the Norris Glacier retreated , the East Twin Glacier , the West Twin Glacier with only the Taku Glacier advancing. Surveys reveal the Taku as one of the deepest glaciers of the sub-temperate icefields surveyed at nearly thick. This glacier was advancing in 1890 when viewed by John Muir and had a large calving front. By 1963 the glacier had advanced . In 1948 the Taku Fjord had been completely filled in with glacial sediment and the glacier no longer calved. From 1948–1986 the glacier had a positive glacier mass balance driving the advance. From 1987–2009 the glacier has had a slightly negative mass balance, not enough to end the advance, but if it continues will soon slow it. Notable peaks on the Juneau Icefield are Devils Paw, Nelles Peak, Emperor Peak, The Snow Towers, Taku Towers, and the Mendenhall Towers.

His chance meeting with American table tennis player, Glenn Cowan, during the 31st World Table Tennis Championship, later referred to as ping-pong diplomacy, triggered the first thawing of the ice in Sino-American relations since 1949. Zhuang was once married to the pianist Bao Huiqiao, and his second wife was the Chinese- born Japanese . Table tennis career Zhuang was born in August 1940 and he joined the Chinese National Table Tennis team as a teenager. His coach was Fu Qifang. In 1961, at the 26th World Table Tennis Championship, he won his first men's singles championship, and at the next two World Table Tennis Championships, the 27th and 28th in 1963 and 1965 respectively, he again won the men's singles championship. On January 20, 1968, two years into the Cultural Revolution, he married Bao Huiqiao in her dormitory room at the National Music Conservatory in Beijing. During the Cultural Revolution which began in 1966, Zhuang was not able to pursue his career as a table tennis player as usual, nor was Bao hers as a pianist.  Unique style among penholders  Influenced by a veteran national team member and national champion Wang Chuanyao, and encouraged by his coach, Zhuang picked up the \\"Dual-sided Offense\\" style in the 1950s when he was a teenager. During the 50s to 60s, the majority of the pen-holding style players lacked attacking or counter-attack capabilities on the backhand side, and relied solely on push- blocking. Wang is believed to be among the pioneers of the \\"Penholding Dual- sided Offense\\" style that emphasize on offensive backhand strokes and drives. Zhuang adopted but modified Wang's style by: #Shortening the strokes of backhand drives – sometimes even by simply using wrist or finger actions to flick the racket (referred to by himself in his book as to \\"knock\\" or \\"snap\\" the ball). #Standing closer to the table than Wang – but still two to three feet away from the table, which is farther away than most push-blocking penholders who are normally within two feet. He did so as a result of his meticulous analysis of the physical differences between him and Wang – Wang was much taller and had a longer arm-coverage which enabled bigger, more powerful swings and strokes. Zhuang had to streamline his strokes and instead attempted to generate a sudden burst of explosive power via a smaller motion, similar to the \\"one-inch punch\\" in the Wing Chun Kung Fu style. He won and dominated three World Championships with this unique style, and encountered almost no competition from the Japanese, European and his fellow Chinese players. Table tennis observers generally believe that he could have won one to two more world championships if the Cultural Revolution had not occurred. This is evidenced by the fact the next two champions both had lopsided losing records against Zhuang during the time when the Chinese team did not participate during the Cultural Revolution. Political career =Ping-pong diplomacy= In late 1969, the training of the National Table Tennis Team resumed as a result of the intervention of Premier Zhou Enlai, and in 1971, Zhuang Zedong and the Chinese team attended the 31st World Table Tennis Championship. One day during the championship in Nagoya, Japan, American team member Glenn Cowan missed his own bus and in his haste got onto the bus of the Chinese team. Unlike his team mates, who ignored Cowan, Zhuang Zedong greeted him and presented him with a silk-screen portrait of the Huangshan Mountains, thus starting the so-called ping-pong diplomacy.Ping-pong melts Cold War rifts Ten months after Zhuang's chance meeting with Cowan, Richard Nixon, then president of the United States, visited China in February, 1972. Only two months later, Zhuang led the Chinese table tennis delegation to the United States from April 18 to 30, as part of an 18-day trip including Canada, Mexico and Peru. The ping-pong diplomacy eventually led to the normalization of Sino- American relationships in 1979. =Cultural Revolution and consequences= In 1973, Zhuang Zedong became a favorite of Jiang Qing, wife of Mao Zedong and leader of the Cultural Revolution. After the downfall in October, 1976 of the Gang of Four of which Jiang Qing was a member, Zhuang Zedong was jailed and investigated. In 1980, the investigation ended and he was sent to Taiyuan, Shanxi to work as a coach of the provincial table tennis team. Personal life =New life in Beijing= In 1985, Zhuang was allowed to return to Beijing again, and it was arranged that he would coach the young table tennis players at the Palace of Youth in Beijing. Zhuang's relationship with Bao Huiqiao had been reportedly deteriorating during the tumultuous years of the Cultural Revolution and was not to be repaired. On February 2, 1985, he and Bao Huiqiao were officially divorced. They had one daughter and one son before their divorce.Zhuang Zedong 10 Feb 2013 Telegraph https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/sport-obituaries/9861200/Zhuang- Zedong.html About this time, Zhuang Zedong published his book Chuang Yu Chuang (Chinese: 闯与创, \\"Adventure and Creation\\"). =Marriage to Atsuko Sasaki= Later in 1985, the Chinese-born Japanese Atsuko Sasaki met Zhuang in Beijing. Sasaki was born in 1944 in Zhangye, Gansu, China to Japanese parents. Her family did not move back to Japan until 1976. By this time, Sasaki had finished her high-school education in China and her father had died of cancer in Lanzhou. Sasaki Atsuko had met Zhuang Zedong previously in Japan in 1971 and 1972 and was a fan of Zhuang. When Zhuang and Sasaki decided to get married, both had to go through a difficult political process due to the political environment in China. Zhuang had to write to Li Ruihuan and Deng Xiaoping about the matter, and Sasaki had to give up her Japanese citizenship and apply for Chinese citizenship. Eventually, Zhuang and Sasaki got married in 1987.South China Morning Post Briefs, February 12, 2013 http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1148265/briefs-february-12-2013 Zhuang and Sasaki lived together for 26 years. Zhuang wrote a book about their story, entitled Deng Xiaoping approved our marriage. Zhuang opened an international table tennis club in Beijing. He visited the United States in 2007, speaking at USC and other universities about his role in fostering better relations between China and the United States. Cancer and death Zhuang Zedong was diagnosed of late-stage colon cancer in 2008. Although he sought treatment in various hospitals around China, the tumour metastasized to his liver and lungs. Five months before his death, he only had one eighth of his liver left. He requested euthanasia, but was denied by his doctors. On 10 February 2013, the first day of the Chinese New Year, Zhuang died at You'an Hospital in Beijing, at the age of 72. Within a day there were 300,000 messages about this death on Chinese microblogging sites.

The film mixes staged interviews with some local residents who claim to have encountered the creature, along with reenactments of encounters. The film's director and producer, Charles B. Pierce, was an advertising salesman who convinced a local businessman to invest in the film and hired locals (mainly high school students) to help complete it. After Pierce's daughter Pamula Pierce Barcelou acquired the rights to The Legend of Boggy Creek, a remastered version of the film premiered in 2019. Plot The film, which claims to be a true story, details the existence of the \\"Fouke Monster\\", a seven-foot-tall Bigfoot-like creature that has reportedly been seen by residents of a small Arkansas community since the 1940s. It is described as being completely covered in reddish-brown hair, leaving three-toed tracks and having a foul odor. Several locals from the small town of Fouke, Arkansas recall their stories, often appearing as themselves, claiming that the creature has killed many large animals over the years. One farmer claims that the beast carried off two of his 200 lb. hogs with little effort, leaping a fence with the animals tucked under its arm. In one scene, a kitten is shown as having been \\"scared to death\\" by the creature. The narrator informs the audience that, while people have shot at the creature in the past, it has always managed to escape. In another sequence, hunters attempt to pursue the creature with dogs, but the dogs refuse to give chase. A police constable states that while driving home one night, the creature suddenly ran across the road in front of his car. In a later sequence, culled from the actual newspaper accounts inspiring the film, the creature is shown menacing a family in a remote country house. After being fired upon, the creature attacks, sending one family member to the hospital. The creature was never captured and is said to still stalk the swamps of southern Arkansas to this day. Cast Production The Legend of Boggy Creek was filmed in Fouke, Arkansas, Shreveport, Louisiana and Texarkana, Texas. Releases =Initial release= The Legend of Boggy Creek was released theatrically to commercial success, earning around $20,000,000 at the box office in 1972. According to Variety, the film earned another $4.8 million in 1975 theatrical rentals in North America.\\"All-Time Film Rental Champs\\", Variety, 7 January 1976, pg. 48. It was the 10th highest-grossing film of 1972. Return to Boggy Creek and Boggy Creek II: And the Legend Continues, were released to theaters later in 1977 and 1985, respectively. Neither of the unauthorized sequels were as successful as the original film. =Home media= The Legend of Boggy Creek has had unauthorized bootleg releases both on VHS, and DVD, several times. Between 2002 and 2011, Hen's Tooth Video, Education 2000 Inc., Sterling Entertainment, Unicorn Video, RHR Home Video, Cheezy Flicks Entertainment, and Film Trauma, all released unauthorized copies of The Legend of Boggy Creek on Region 1 DVD. The DVD versions have been notoriously low quality, most of them seemingly taken from VHS editions, and all of them were 'Pan and Scan' transfers, rather than the movie's proper widescreen Techniscope presentation. For years, The Legend of Boggy Creek was thought to be in the public domain, and all VHS/DVD releases were unofficial. However, Pamula Pierce Barcelou, daughter of director Charles B. Pierce, gained control of the movie in 2018, when Steve Ledwell, of Ledwell & Son, assigned her copyright of both The Legend of Boggy Creek and another Pierce film, Bootleggers. Mr Ledwell's father, L.W., helped finance The Legend of Boggy Creek, which found also success as a low-budget, drive-in creature feature.http://www.texarkanagazette.com/news/texarkana/story/2018/aug/01/gettin- boggy-it/736988/ The Legend of Boggy Creek will receive its first official release on DVD and Blu-ray from the new 4K restoration of the original camera negative in January 2020, which restores the film's original wide-angle, Techniscope film aspect ratio (2.35 : 1), brilliant color, and pioneering soundtrack. Ahead of the home video release, the restored print received its theatrical premier at the historic Perot Theater, Texarkana, TX on June 14, 2019http://www.trahc.org/other-events/32484-gala-premiere-of-the- remasteredlegend-of-boggy-creek with additional screenings at select theaters nationwide. =2019 re-release= The Legend of Boggy Creek was restored/remastered at the George Eastman Museum, Rochester, New York, & Audio Mechanics, Burbank, California, using many of the original elements. The film premiered at the historic Perot Theatre, Texarkana, Texas, on Friday, June 14, 2019. Additional showings began at midnight, June 15, and continued through Sunday, June 16 (Charles B. Pierce Day in Texarkana, Arkansas and Texas). The next screening took place in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, on Friday, July 5 at the Colonial Theatre. Additional screenings followed at select theaters nationwide. Reception The Legend of Boggy Creek received generally favorable reviews upon its initial release. \\"... Scene after scene of almost pristine wilderness is a visual feast ... its sheer honest ... rigid adherence to authenticity ... is highly persuasive that there is indeed, a “Fouke Monster.” It's scary and charming ...\\" Arkansas Gazette, Little Rock \\"... visually stunning and exciting ... Pierce manages to create a sense of foreboding that brings audiences up sharply ...\\" Goff, Daily Variety. \\"... the film captures the eerie beauty of Arkansas’ primeval swamps and contains images of Southern American backwoods life unmatched in its rich rustic flavor since Robert Flaherty's Louisiana Story ... Pierce's photography accents the Arkansas swampland's incredible beauty and unsettling mystery ... an unusual blend of malevolence and melancholia ... eminently successful in giving the imagination a good healthy jolt and in ultimately celebrating the unfathomable mysteries of nature ...\\" Glenn Lovell, Hollywood Reporter.  Legacy  Writer and director Daniel Myrick cited The Legend of Boggy Creek as an influence on his 1999 film The Blair Witch Project. =Unofficial sequels= In 1977, Return to Boggy Creek was released. It was directed by Tom Moore. Charles B. Pierce was not involved with the film's production, and the film carries over none of the original's docudrama elements. It stars Dawn Wells of Gilligan's Island fame and Dana Plato of Diff'rent Strokes. Wells portrays the mother of three children who become lost in the swamp until the creature comes to their rescue. In 1985 Boggy Creek II: And the Legend Continues was released. Pierce returned to direct this film which was written as a direct sequel to the original film, thus the reason for styling the title as \\"II\\" instead of \\"III\\". It follows the adventures of a University of Arkansas professor (Pierce) and his students, one of which is Pierce's son, on their trip to Fouke, Arkansas, to find and study the creature. A few scenes in the beginning of the movie were shot at the university, including an Arkansas Razorbacks football game. The movie was featured in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. The \\"Big Creature\\" in the film was portrayed by James Faubus Griffith, a Hollywood stuntman, actor and bodyguard. In 2010, another unauthorized film with no narrative connection to the original was released, title Boggy Creek: The Legend is True. It concerns a Bigfoot-like creature who attacks a group of teenagers that are vacationing in the fictional area of Boggy Creek, Texas. The film was written and directed by Brian T. Jaynes. It was originally produced in 2010 and released straight to DVD on September 13, 2011.

The name Canapé is the french word for \\"couch\\". Canapé is the invention of Pierre Albarran, a French auction and contract bridge player, theorist, and author. His book on the topic is long out-of-print and hard to find. A French pair, Pierre Jaïs and Roger Trézel, used a canapé system to become one of the strongest pairs in the world during the 1950s and 1960s. They achieved a triple crown of major world championships from 1956 to 1962, two at representing France and the inaugural World Open Pairs Championship. Canapé is also the basis of the Roman Club and Blue Team Club systems, which were used by the Italian Blue Team to win many world championships in the 1950s and 1960s. Some of the early Blue Team players used a \\"natural\\" canapé style. A \\"Modified Italian Canapé System\\" is still in use today. Canapé openings have several technical advantages: * It is easy to find 4-4 major-suit fits, and responder may quickly raise the bidding- level. * When you immediately find a 4-4 major-suit fit, opener may never reveal his longer side-suit, making defence considerably more difficult. * Opening a 4-card major on balanced hands has more preemptive value, than opening a 2- or 3-card minor in standard system. * When opening with a longer side-suit, Left-Hand-Opponent is less likely to have a shape fit for a takeout-double, and may not be able to enter the bidding. * Often, a canapé- bidder opens a 4-card suit where Left-Hand-Opponent has 4 or more cards making it more difficult for opponents to enter the bidding. * Over a canapé-opening, opponents will sometimes overcall in openers 5+suit, making them vulnerable to penalty-doubles. * When playing a strong-1 system, canapé openings can be used to resolve the mediocre 2-opening in many such systems (e.g. Precision Club and similar). The following examples apply to some canapé systems but not all: The hand KQ73 5 AQJ94 J54 is opened 1. If partner does not raise the spades, the diamond suit is introduced in the next bidding round. With the spade and diamond suits reversed (AQJ94 5 KQ73 J54) the prescribed opening is 1 followed by a spade bid in the next round. The consequence of this approach is that on more balanced hands such as hands with a 4-4-3-2 distribution, only one four card suit can be introduced. With the hand KQ73 95 AQJ4 J54 a Canapé bidder will open 1 and following a 2 response rebid notrump. Hands with a 5-3-3-2 distribution are either opened in the five card suit followed by a notrump rebid (or a rebid in the same suit if the suit is solid), or in certain cases opened Canapé on a strong three card suit.

The show starred Barry Dale as Harrigan, a leprechaun. Harrigan was produced by Kingston, Ontario television station CKWS-TV, and aired across Canada in syndication. Part of the theme song included the words: \\"H - A - double R - I - G - A - N ... it's Harr-i-gan!\\" Portions of the half-hour program would involve the title character viewing hand drawn pictures submitted by his loyal fan-base of children by looking into his magical pot of gold. His co-star for these segments was Dale's daughter, Deb-Lyn. Miss Sunflower, who delivered the mail while riding a unicycle, was played by Dale's wife, Jo-Anna. Another segment would have Harrigan sitting with his good puppet friend Mr. Green (also played by Deb-Lyn) as they read a book to the children watching. The character originated at CJOH-TV in Ottawa, Ontario, where it ran for its first two seasons. The leprechaun originally appeared on a children's show called Sandbox at 7 a.m. on the CTV Television Network. Dale suggested syndicating the television show, a request that the station manager was not willing to do. Lorne Freed of CKWS-TV invited Dale to syndicate Harrigan from his station. Harrigan taped original shows until 1985 and then ran re-runs until 1992. The Harrigan series won three CanPro Awards, which are the Canadian equivalent of the Emmy Awards for syndicated programs. The Harrigan show is no longer running due to a technical issue. The show was recorded on large two-inch tapes that eventually wore out. At the time nobody thought to transfer the media to a longer-lasting media. At CKWS, Dale was also promotions manager and for a time had a lunchtime variety show, but left in a dispute and started Godfatha Pizzas. Customers who recognized Dale and performed the song or a little jig, received an extra slice or topping. The Dales moved to Arizona in 2001.

The story includes a number of threads that are slowly woven together. The central thread concerns a kidnapping that turns into a murder and the negotiator's attempts to solve the crime. Synopsis In 1989, Texan oil baron Cyrus Miller and shipping tycoon Melvin Scanlon conspire to bring the oil fields of the Middle East under American control. Meanwhile, United States President John Cormack and his Soviet counterpart Mikhail Gorbachev draw up plans for a $100 billion arms reduction bill – the \\"Nantucket Treaty\\". This proves debilitating for Miller and Scanlon's plans, so they team up with three arms manufacturers who will be financially ruined by the treaty and hire mercenary Irving Moss, a sexual sadist and ex-CIA officer recently released from prison, to devise a plan to destroy the President and therefore the treaty. The plan begins when the President's son, Simon, is kidnapped while spending a year studying abroad at Oxford University. When the Vice President demands an expert hostage negotiator to handle the situation, CIA Deputy Director of Operations David Weintraub nominates his old friend Quinn, an ex- Green Beret sergeant who later became renowned as the world's most successful hostage negotiator, but he has retired to Málaga and is not interested in working for the government.Frederick Forsyth, \\"The Negotiator\\", Bantam Press, 1989, pages 119-122. Weintraub coaxes Quinn out of retirement and he agrees to handle the negotiations if they allow him to do it his way. He is joined in his designated London flat, against his wishes, by FBI agent Samantha \\"Sam\\" Somerville and CIA officer Duncan McCrea. The kidnappers make contact and after two weeks of negotiation, agree on a $2 million ransom in diamonds, but are spooked by a fake news report that the police are closing in: Quinn steals the diamonds, evades the police and FBI and sets up the ransom drop himself, but is abducted and held in the kidnapper's hideout alongside Simon. Later, Simon and Quinn are released at different points on a deserted road, but as Simon runs towards Quinn and the police, he is killed in an explosion. President Cormack is devastated when he learns of his son's death: the possibility of his being removed under the terms of the 25th Amendment is brought up. A postmortem shows that Simon was killed by a bomb hidden in a belt given to him by his kidnappers: the bomb was set off by a miniature detonator – minidet – found only in the Soviet space programme. The Soviets are blamed and the Nantucket Treaty is effectively finished. Quinn is arrested by the FBI but released for lack of evidence. He decides to go after the kidnappers himself, and Sam – who has fallen in love with Quinn – is sent by the FBI to follow him. Quinn discovers that the kidnappers are a squad of mercenaries, but ends up finding two of them murdered. Later, the leader of the squad makes contact with Quinn and reveals that the kidnapping and ransom were part of a contract from a fat American-accented man who stayed in darkness to avoid being identified; the murder was completely unexpected, and the belt bomb was given to Simon by a Corsican hitman assigned to the squad by the contractor. The mercenaries fled across Europe after Simon's murder, but the leader found out about Quinn's investigation and called him to confess and surrender; while returning the diamonds, he is killed in a drive-by shooting from which Quinn and Sam only narrowly escape. Sam and Quinn part ways and Quinn travels to Corsica to confront the last mercenary, but is forced to kill him in self-defense. Flying back to London, Quinn is drugged, kidnapped and taken to the Russian embassy where KGB chief General Kirpicenko shows him photos of Miller, Scanlon and the three arms manufacturers who had been identified after paying an unexpected trip to a Russian airbase: it is believed they met with General Koslov, head of Soviet Southern High Command, and he gave them the minidet. Kirpicenko tells Quinn to return to Washington to flush out the conspirators and sneaks him into Vermont via Canada, secretly assigning an agent of his to provide overwatch on Quinn. Knowing that the White House will have Sam's phones tapped and her mail intercepted, Quinn, hiding in a secluded cabin in the Vermont wilderness, sends her a (fake) letter stating that he knows who Simon's killers were and that he is holed up in some safe place writing it all down. Shortly after, Quinn finds Sam and tells her to be on the lookout. Sam tells Quinn that David Weintraub has been in touch and Quinn agrees to meet him, but they are instead met by Irving Moss (who has a score of his own to settle with Quinn that dates back to their days in the Vietnam War) and Duncan McCrea (revealed to be Moss' equally sadistic protégé, who turns out to have blown up Simon with the belt bomb personally). Quinn and Sam are taken at gunpoint back to Quinn's cabin where Moss reads Quinn's report, explaining that he and McCrea had been spying on them across Europe and killing the mercenaries before Quinn could reach them. Finding out that the report is fake, McCrea begins torturing Sam while Moss takes Quinn outside to execute him: however, Kirpicenko's concealed agent shoots Moss first, giving Quinn the chance to retrieve Moss' gun, return to the cabin and kill McCrea. Searching the corpses reveals Moss' address book, which eventually yields a coded telephone number which Sam identifies as belonging to a very senior politician. Quinn calls the number and, mimicking Moss' voice, demands a bonus payment for all the 'unforeseen trouble' he has had to deal with, and arranges a meeting with the man at the 'usual place', which turns out to be near the Vietnam War Memorial. The man turns out to be Hubert Reed, the Secretary of the Treasury, who publicly supported the Nantucket Treaty but secretly opposed it for having invested his fortune in armament companies; the trustees of his blind trust had not moved the investments. He offers Quinn the $5 million Swiss bank draft (payable to the bearer) he had brought for Moss and Quinn hands over the report he has written, but the real report is later sent to the President, who then chooses not to resign and tells the world in a special broadcast the next evening what really happened to his son and why. In the aftermath, Cyrus Miller is arrested, but certified insane and therefore unable to stand trial; Scanlon and one of the arms manufacturers are arrested and confess to the entire plot; a second flees the country and the third commits suicide; Koslov is apprehended by the KGB and discreetly executed. The President orders the FBI manhunt for Quinn to be permanently called off: by then, Quinn and Sam have flown off to Spain to get married. A newspaper Quinn briefly reads, made redundant earlier by the President's speech, mentions a $5 million anonymous donation to the Vietnam Veterans Paraplegic Hospital and the \\"accidental and mysterious\\" death of Treasury Secretary Reed by drowning. Plagiarism In 1990 Australian broadcaster Alan Jones had been a regular writer for The Sun-Herald when the newspaper announced that Jones' column would no longer appear following a petition by staff calling for his removal as a contributor. This followed Jones' publication of a column predicting an oil crisis, in which a large amount of the material had been taken directly from Forsyth's novel The Negotiator without any attribution or indication that the source was a work of fiction.

The uniqueness of this temple is that this is the only temple of Shri Vishnu all over India having Shri Vishnu’s name as BHAGAVANT. The temple was built in 1245 A.D. in Hemadpanthi style. There are four entries to the temple from all the four directions, but the main entry is east-facing. There is one GARUDKHAMB in front of Garbhagraha. The idol of main deity Shri Bhagvant is in black stone having SHANKH, CHAKRA andGADA is in the hands and picture of devotee king Ambrish below the right hand. Shri Laxmi is on the back of Bhagvant idol. Shivlinga is there on the forehead and marks of Footsteps of Bhrigu Rishi on the chest of the deity. There are old records showing the grants released by Shri Nanasaheb Peshve in the year 1760, by East India Company in 1823 and by British Government in 1784. The temple management is looked after by a Panch Committee. Badves carry out the work of daily rituals of the temple. The daily rituals include Kakada Arti, Nitya Puja, Mahapuja in the morning, Dhuparti in the evening and Shejarti in the night. A large number of devotees visit during the Chaitri, Maghi, Aashadi & kartiki (Hindu Months) Ekadashi. During the Aashadi & Kartiki Ekadashi a large procession is taken out covering the town with Bhagvant riding on Garuda. A CHABINA is taken out on every full moon day. Ritual at Sri Bhagawanta Mandir: Every morning at five Lord Bhagawanta is woken up with the Kakad arati adorations to the accompaniment of the sound of the cymbals. Several devotees, both men and women, attend these morning devotions. They bring the offerings of sugar, fruits, milk, curds and butter. The traditional honour of the Kakad of Bhagawant Mandir is with Sri Dattatreya Krishnath Patil. The priest is particular about continuing this convention. It was Sri Bhaurao Tatya Patil who took up the onus of Bhagawant Kakad way back, a tradition that has been passed down the generations. At the time of Kakad arati, the Lord is first adored with ghee lamps and then the priest changes the cloak and offerings of fruits and sugar are made. The lotus feet of the Lord are washed with warm water. Incense is waved, milk offered in silver vessels and then a pancharati performed. After this Sri Ganapati and Varun are worshipped with blowing of conch. The priest puts a blob of butter in Lord’s mouth. Then He is anointed with milk, curds, ghee, sugar and honey. Lord Bhagawanta is given a bath with water showered out of His silver pail. This water is considered equal in merit to Bhagirathi and sprinkled upon the devotees assembled. After this follows the karpur arati and hymns and praises are sung by the devotees. After the Lord has bathed and put on new clothes, He is given an offering of khichadi. This is being taken care of by the local business community— Sri Nanasaheb Budukh and Sri Balasaheb Kokate are looking at this aspect presently. In the afternoon, the Brahmins of town, Deshpande, Budukh, Joshi, Patil, Deshmukh etc. provide the naivedya/repast for Lord Bhagawanta. The priests bring this from the homes of the respective families. Many are the offerings made on occasions such as Gudi Padva, Dasera, Diwali etc. Educational institutes The city is well known in the region for its educational institutions and nearby districts and tehsils depends upon these educational facilities Major Pre Schools * Shishuvihar Barshi Major Primary Schools * Maharashtra Vidyalaya, Barshi * Navin Marathi Vidyalaya, Barshi * Nutan Marathi Vidyalaya, Barshi * Jijamata Primary School, Barshi * Mahatma Phule Primary School, Barshi * MIT Pune's Smt.

It closely resembles Laxmann's shrew (Sorex caecutiens), a common species with a wide range, and there were doubts as to the validity of the species.

Fast Hack'em is a Commodore 64 fast disk/file copier, nibbler and disk editor written by Mike J. Henry and released in 1985. It was distributed in the U.S. and Canada via Henry's \\"Basement Boys Software\\", and in the U.K. via Datel Electronics. In the U.S., it retailed for $29.95 (). Features The most popular feature of Fast Hack'em was its ability to produce copies of copy- protected commercial software. When using the nibbler, disk copying is done on a very low level, bit-by-bit rather than using standard Commodore DOS commands. This effectively nullifies the efficacy of deliberate disk errors, non-standard track layouts, and related forms of copy prevention. Copying a protected disk takes approximately 60 seconds if being copied directly to another disk drive, or three minutes (plus several disk swaps) if performed using a single disk drive. Fast Hack'em also includes a very fast disk copier that can copy unprotected disks at even higher speeds. Only 35 seconds are required with two drives, or two minutes plus swapping time with one drive. For all forms of copying, Fast Hack'em can verify the resulting disk copies to ensure that they were properly written. The MSD SD-2 dual drive is supported, with copies finished in 60 seconds, about twice as fast as without the software. Fast Hack'em was updated often, and later versions added more copying options. The one feature that stood out from other copying programs was that these updates include \\"parameters\\". They include the methods of copy protection individual programs use so even a fast copy can then be artificially \\"re-protected\\" and give a working copy. In later versions of Fast Hack'em, disk copying can be performed without the computer if two Commodore 1541 disk drives are available. The software is loaded with a Commodore 64, the two drive option is be selected which transfers software to the drives' controller memory, and the serial cable can be disconnected from the computer. Any number of copies can be performed as long as neither drive is powered down. Reception Ahoy! in October 1985 called Fast Hack'em \\"a must-needed utility for Commodore disk users\\" and \\"probably the fastest way to copy an entire 1541 formatted disk at the present time\\", joking that a disadvantage was the end of \\"leisurely coffee breaks or refrigerator raids\\" during copying. Info described Fast Hack'em as \\"the most extraordinary copy program I have ever seen for the 64\\", stating that copying a disk in 35 seconds with two 1541 drives was \\"not even enough time to fill out the label\\".

History =Chronology= *8 November 1922: The first section of line 9 was opened between Exelmans and Trocadéro in the 16th arrondissement. *27 May 1923: The line was extended from Trocadéro to Saint Augustin. *3 June 1923: The line was extended from Saint Augustin to Chaussée d'Antin. *29 September 1923: The line was extended southbound from Exelmans to Porte de St-Cloud. *30 June 1928: The line was extended from Chaussée d'Antin to Richelieu-Drouot. *10 December 1933: The line was extended from Richelieu-Drouot to Porte de Montreuil. *3 February 1934: The line was extended from Porte de St-Cloud to Pont de Sèvres. *14 October 1937: The line was extended from Porte de Montreuil to Mairie de Montreuil. *2 September 1939: At the outbreak of World War II, service to Saint-Martin ceased. Unlike most other stations, however, Saint-Martin never re-opened due to its proximity to Strasbourg - Saint-Denis (only 100 meters separate the two stations). *21 October 2013: Gradual cascading of MF 67 to MF 01 trains began. =Origins= Line 9 was originally envisioned as a branch of Line 2 Sud (now known as Line 6) between Porte de Saint-Cloud and Trocadero. However, it was concluded by the CMP to combine this segment with a proposed segment that was to be built towards Opera, and thus Line 9 is created. The first section between Trocadero and Exelmans opened on 8 November 1922. =Construction and Extensions= Construction of the original sections (as well as the extension towards République) proved to be difficult due to public opposition in the various arrondissements as well as unstable soil above the tunnels. Public support for the line's construction was greatly difficult due in part to proposed sections that various entities saw as impossible to build and operate under government regulations at the time. In addition, unstable soil led to the collapse of several sections of tunnel being constructed. The double-decker tunnel, which is located between stations Richelieu - Drouot and République (and carries Line 9 on the lower level, while Line 8 is situated on the upper level) was especially problematic due to unstable ground at Grand Boulevards. As a result, this particular section had to be reinforced by central piers. The first extension into the suburbs, towards Pont de Sèvres, opened on 3 February 1934. On 14 October 1937, the eastern extension towards Mairie de Montreuil opened. Since then, few changes to the line's infrastructure have been made. (from :fr:Ligne 9 du métro de Paris) Rolling stock Line 9 is operated with the MF 01 stock in five-car sets. Before that, line 9 was the last line equipped of the pre-war Sprague-Thomson-trains, which were removed from service on 16 April 1983. On 9 February 2011, the STIF announced plans to acquire 66 new Mf 01-trainsets. The €330 million order began deliveries during June 2013 and will continue through 2016 to replace the current stock on line 9. The Last MF67 on Line 9 was pulled from service on 28 November 2016.66 nouvelles rames pour la ligne 9 On 21 October 2013, the first MF 01 railcar (#096) entered revenue service along Line 9, after spending the course of June through September running along Line 5. The Auteuil workshops, which Line 10 used to share with Line 9, was not equipped to handle maintenance operations for the MF 01 rolling stock, and thus heavy maintenance work was done at the Bobigny workshops along Line 5.

The purpose of bidding is for each partnership to ascertain which contract, whether made or defeated and whether bid by them or by their opponents, would give the partnership their best scoring result. Each bidding system ascribes a meaning to every possible call by each member of a partnership, and presents a codified language which allows the players to exchange information about their card holdings. The vocabulary of is limited to 38 different calls - 35 level/denomination bidsA bid consists of two components — the level in range of 1-7, and one of five denominations: clubs (), diamonds (), hearts (), spades () and notrump (NT) plus pass, double and redouble. Any bid becomes a contract if followed by three successive passes, therefore every bridge bid is a potential contract. By the rules of the game, the agreed meanings of all calls must be public and known to the opponents. In normal club or home play, the opponents are entitled, at their turn to make a call, to ask the partner of the bidder about the meaning of the call. In high- level tournaments, where screens are used, the procedure is to ask the screen- mate about their calls as well as their partner's calls. In serious online tournaments, the procedure is for the player making the call to self-alert it, but the explanation is visible only to the opponents. Classification Bidding systems can be classified into two broad categories: natural systems and artificial systems. In natural systems, most bids (especially in the early phase of the bidding) denote length in the suit bid. In artificial systems, the bids are more highly codified, so that for example a bid of 1 may not be related to a holding in the club suit. Natural system(s) are the \\"lingua franca\\" of bridge players, with regional variations. Thus, a new partnership can agree to play a natural system and understand each other fairly well. Players sometimes alter certain aspects of a system, adding their specific agreements or preferred conventions. Structure and meaning of opening bids are the common determining factor for system classification: in most modern natural systems, opening bids of 1 through 2 have the same or similar meaning, with level-one bids denoting length in a suit. Artificial systems typically reserve at least one one-level suit opening bid for special purposes, unrelated to the suit. =Natural systems= Natural systems generally use opening bids as follows: *A bid of 1 or 1 shows at least 4 or 5 cards in the major suit, and 1 or 1 shows at least 3 or 4 cards in the minor suit. The complete hand usually contains about (11)12-20(22) high card points. As between two major suits or between two minor suits, the bidder opens in the longer suit; with equal lengths, the higher ranking suit is usually chosen. If the opening bid of 1 or 1 promises 5 cards, the system is referred to as a \\"five-card major\\" system; otherwise, it is referred to as a \\"four-card major\\" system. The term five-card majors implies that an opening bid in a minor suit bid might show three card length only (for example, the hand pattern might be 4=4=2=3, so neither major suit is long enough to show with an opening bid). *A bid of 1NT shows a balanced hand in a narrow high card points (HCP) range. The common ranges are 15-17 or 16-18 HCP (\\"strong notrump\\") and 12-14 (\\"weak notrump\\"). *A bid of 2 typically shows a very strong hand (22+ points). *A bid of 2NT shows a strong balanced hand, usually 20-21 HCP. *Opening bids of 3 of any suit are preemptive, showing a 7+ card suit and 6-10 points (mostly inside the bid suit). *The meaning of 2, 2 and 2 varies. One common usage is that the bid shows a weak two bid, similar to a preemptive bid. Another is the strong two bid, which is natural and shows a very strong hand (too strong for a 1-level opening). Yet another usage, popular in otherwise natural systems, is to use weak two bids in the major suits, and 2 as Flannery: four spades and five hearts in a hand of minimum strength. Specific systems The most widespread natural systems are: *Acol, featuring 4-card majors and weak notrump, originating in Great Britain *Standard American, originally with 4-card majors but later adopting 5-card majors. Strong notrump. *Bridge Base Basic, based on Standard American and used in internet play *2/1 game forcing, based on Standard American and gradually superseding it. Some features of 2/1 game forcing originated from the Roth–Stone and Kaplan–Sheinwold systems of the 1950s and 1960s. Various developments in the area of natural systems have resulted in systems that are natural in essence, but contain special features. Examples are systems like Romex, Boring Club, Fantunes, and EHAA (Every Hand An Adventure). =Artificial systems= Artificial systems can be further classified into: *Strong club systems are the most popular artificial systems, where opening of 1 shows a strong hand (typically 16+ HCP). Other 1-level bids are typically natural, but limited to about 15 HCP. The most popular strong club systems are: Vanderbilt Club (the predecessor) Precision Club Blue Club *In Small club systems, the opening bid of 1 is forcing but not necessarily strong. It typically includes some range of balanced hands, some hands with long club suit, and very strong hands. Examples are: Vienna Club (the predecessor) Roman Club, developed and used by famous Blue Team Polish Club, originating (and standard) in Poland but also gained certain popularity worldwide. Dutch doubleton, an offspring of the Polish Club system SAYC+, Based on Standard American but with the 1 forcing and including all 21+ hands too. *Strong diamond systems are similar to strong club systems, but the bid of 1 shows a strong opening, typically 16+ and the bid of 1 is typically nebulous. This gives more room over the nebulous 1 opening compared to the strong club's nebulous 1 opening. There are several examples listed here www.strongdiamond.co.uk. *Strong pass systems are based on the idea that 8-12 HCP hands are the most frequent (about 45% chance to hold such a hand). Most of the initial opening bids describe this range, while strong (13+ HCP) hands (28% of the hands) start with PASS, the lowest available bid. Weak (0-7 HCP) hands are opened with one other bid, often 1. Of course partner in 3rd or 4th place will never pass a strong PASS \\"opening\\", thus 3rd and 4th place \\"openings\\" are different. Strong pass systems were popular in Poland in the 1960s and 1970s, before the restrictions. These systems are often relay-based, but it is not a necessity, their main advantage is that they initiate with the most frequent intermediate hands and rob some bidding space with the weak ones. Strong pass systems are mostly banned by World Bridge Federation and other governing organizations from all competitions except the highest-level ones, because opponents cannot be reasonably expected to cope with such an unusual approach. See: Highly unusual method *Relay systems are based on relay bids - the artificial bids where one partner just bids the cheapest denomination (relay bid) and the other describes his distribution and high cards in detail (relay response) using a highly codified scheme. Such systems are out of the above classification (based on opening bid structure), as the relay feature takes place later in the auction. For example, relatively popular \\"Moscito system\\" has variants based on strong-club and strong-pass approaches. Symmetric relay is based on Precision club. Relay systems do not need to begin with an initial forcing pass or an initial forcing 1 opening. The ACBL typically disallows relay systems, on the grounds that they are too difficult to defend against without a lot of advance preparation.

Between 1867 and 1875, military units fought against the Comanche people in a series of expeditions and campaigns until the Comanche surrendered and relocated to a reservation. Background John Gast called American Progress, is an allegorical representation of the modernization of the new west. Here Columbia, a personification of the United States, leads civilization westward with American settlers, stringing telegraph wire as she sweeps west; she holds a school book. The different stages of economic activity of the pioneers are highlighted and, especially, the changing forms of transportation. Western settlement brought the Spanish, French, English, and American settlers into regular contact with the native tribes of the region. Many of these Indians were friendly, and received the new settlers gladly, offering to trade and coexist peacefully, while other tribes resisted the newcomers. The idea of Manifest Destiny as well as the Homestead Act pushed American and immigrant settlers further west, thereby creating more competition for a finite amount of land. This competition for land created tension between the Anglo settlers and the Natives of the region. In an effort to prevent conflicts in the area, many treaties were signed promising land and peace between the two parties, but such treaties were rarely honored. The Comanche tribe was one of the main sources of native resistance in the region that became Oklahoma and Texas, and often came into conflict with both other tribes and the newer settlers. With the outbreak of the Civil War, some Indian tribes attempted to align themselves with what they believed would be the winning side. In the case of the Comanche, the tribe signed a treaty with the Confederacy, and when the war ended they were forced to swear loyalty to the United States government at Fort Smith.Thomas W. Kavanagh. Comanche political history : an ethnohistorical perspective, 1706-1875. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press in cooperation with the American Indian Studies Research Institute, Indiana University, Bloomington, 1996. P.399 This did little to end the cycle of raiding which had come to typify this region. Spreading over a large expanse of the southern plains, the Comanche fought hard diplomatically to maintain power in the region they controlled. In the Treaty of Little Arkansas in 1865, the Comanche tribe was awarded a large piece of land spanning parts of Oklahoma and Texas. Some parts of this region, called the Comancheria, soon became part of the Indian reservation.Pekka Hamalainen. The Comanche Empire. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2008. P.313 A map showing Comanche lands Comancheria during the 1800s. This treaty was later followed by the Medicine Lodge Treaty in 1867, which helped to solidify the reservation system for the Plains Indians. These policies eventually became part of President Ulysses S. Grant's Peace Policy, which prioritized missionary work and education over fighting. President Grant's Peace Policy became an important part of the white-Indian relations for a number of years. \\"Comanche campaign\\" Quanah Parker, prominent Comanche leader, in ceremonial regalia, ca. 1892 A faction of the Comanche tribe, the Quahadi, was arguably the most resistant towards the Anglo settlers. Skeptical of what they would bring, the Quahadi avoided contact with these men. Goods were never exchanged between the groups, and because of this seclusion they were largely unaffected by the cholera plagues in 1816 and 1849. The Quahadi were noted for their fierce nature; so much so that other Comanche feared them. They were the wealthiest of the Comanche in terms of horses and cattle, and they had never signed a peace treaty. It was this faction of the Comanche that gave the American troops the most trouble during this period.S. C. Gwynne (Samuel C. ).

P.6 General William T. Sherman sent four cavalry companies from the United States Army to capture the Indians responsible for the Warren Wagon raid, but this assignment eventually developed into eliminating the threat of the Comanche tribe, namely Quanah Parker and his Quahadi. Following on the heels of the Civil War, the Army had a low number of recruits, and very little money to pay the soldiers they did have, so few men were sent west to fight the Indian threat. Approximately 5,000 enlisted men, divided into ten regiments made up the American forces that would face the powerful Comanche.Pekka Hamalainen. The Comanche Empire. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2008. P.332 General Sherman picked Ranald S.

P.63 Mackenzie and his men developed a style of fighting designed to slowly defeat the Comanche rather than face them in open battle. Colonel Mackenzie embarked on several expeditions into the Comancheria in an effort to destroy the Comanche winter camps and crops, as well as their horses and cattle. Reminiscent of General Sherman's \\"March to the Sea,\\" the 4th Cavalry fought the Comanche by destroying their means of survival. =Llano Estacado= In the fall of 1871, Mackenzie and his 4th Cavalry, as well as two companies in the 11th Infantry, arrived in Texas, began to seek out their target.S.

P.334 The second expedition lasted longer than the first, from September to November, and succeeded in making it clear to the Comanche that the peace policy was no longer in effect. Mackenzie established a strong border patrol at several forts in the area, such as Fort Richardson, Fort Griffin, and Fort Concho. While there was little direct combat between the two forces, the American tactics were successful. By following the Comanche tribe throughout the region and destroying each of their camps, Mackenzie and his cavalry were able to hinder the Comanche's ability to prepare properly for winter. Mackenzie's third expedition, in September 1872, was the largest. Capturing 130 Indian women and children, stealing horses, and ransacking Indian camps, Mackenzie and the Fourth Cavalry spanned the region several times with the assistance of the Twenty-fourth Infantry and his Tonkawa scouts. These captives were later used in a deal made between the soldiers at Fort Sill and the Comanche tribe: peace in exchange for hostages. The Comanche agreed to the terms, and there was a period of peace in the region. During this period of peace, Mackenzie continued to map and explore the Llano Estacado region through the south and central areas, while also creating a second front in the west in order to separate the Comanche from their source of weapons and food.Pekka Hamalainen. The Comanche Empire. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2008. P.335 In the winter of 1873, record numbers of Comanche people resided at Fort Sill, and after the exchange of hostages, there was a noticeable drop in violence between the Anglos and the Native Indians. However, in an attempt to finalize the submission of the Comanche people, there was a movement towards bison hunting. The species became threatened as a result, and those Comanche people who were not at Fort Sill were on the brink of starvation.Pekka Hamalainen. The Comanche Empire. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2008. P.337 The remaining Native American Tribes began to gather at the North Fork of the Red River, the center of the slowly diminishing Comancheria region. Due to tensions between them and the Indian Office, the Indians saw the withholding of rations as a declaration of war, and acted accordingly. =Red River War= Adobe Walls battlefieldThe Second Battle of Adobe Walls in 1874 was one of the opening engagements of the summer and fall campaign in 1874, even though it did not involve military personnel. After the attack, federal officials issued an order stating that all Southern Plains Indians were expected to be living on their designated reservation lands by August 1, 1874.Paul Howard Carlson. The Buffalo Soldier Tragedy of 1877. 1st ed.. College Station: Texas A&M; University Press, 2003. P.64 After the deadline passed, approximately 2,000 Comanche remained in the Comancheria region. When they refused to relocate, the United States government dispatched 1,400 soldiers, launching an operation that became known as the Red River War.Pekka Hamalainen. The Comanche Empire. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2008. P.338 One of the deciding battles of the Red River War was fought at Palo Duro Canyon on September 28, 1874. Colonel Mackenzie and his Black Seminole Scouts and Tonkawa scouts surprised the Comanche, as well as a number of other tribes, and destroyed their camps. The battle ended with only three Comanche casualties, but resulted in the destruction of both the camp and the Comanche pony herd. This defeat spelled the end of the war between the Comanche and the Americans.Pekka Hamalainen. The Comanche Empire. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2008. P.341 Aftermath Following the Red River War, a campaign that lasted from August–November in 1874, the Comanche surrendered and moved to their new lands on the reservation. However even after that loss, it was not until June 1875 that the last of the Comanche, those under the command of Quanah Parker, finally surrendered at Fort Sill.Paul Howard Carlson. The Buffalo Soldier Tragedy of 1877. 1st ed.. College Station: Texas A&M; University Press, 2003. P.65 Though the U.S. troops themselves were directly responsible for just a few hundred deaths, their tactics in the Comanche campaign were the most devastating to the tribe. The tactics they used eventually led to the economic, rather than military, downfall of the tribe. The Comanche tribe, starting with nearly 5,000 people in 1870, finally surrendered and moved onto the reservation with barely 1,500 remaining in 1875. Notes Bibliography Paul Howard Carlson.

It belongs to the Charaxinae (rajahs and nawabs) in the brush-footed butterfly family (Nymphalidae). It occurs in the Himalayas from Kashmir to Sikkim, the hills of central India and the Eastern Ghats, the Western Ghats and southern India, Sri Lanka, Assam, Cachar, and via Myanmar, Cambodia and the Tenasserim Hills far into Indonesia. In August 2016 a specimen was spotted and caught in Palawan, Philippines. Description left Male and female. Upperside black. Forewings and hindwings with a discal broad transverse area from below vein 4 in forewing to vein 2 on hindwing, a moderately large spot in interspace 5, a minute preapical dot beyond in interspace 6 on forewing, and a subterminal row of spots with two or three spots beyond them on the tornal angle of the hindwing, pale yellow, sometimes with an ochraceous, sometimes with a greenish tinge. The discal area on the forewing nearly as broad in interspace 3 as on the dorsum, on the hindwing narrowing to an acute point on vein 2 at two-thirds of its length from base of wing. Tails touched with bluish grey. Underside with the discal transverse area and spot in interspace 5 as on the upperside; base and costal margin of the forewing to apex, and base and dorsal margin of the hindwing broadly lilacine brown, on forewing with two small black spots near base. Bordering the transverse discal area on the inner side, where it is margined with black lines, and above, is a broad chocolate carved band, continued more narrowly along the outer side of the discal area; beyond this on the forewing is a concave series of dusky black lunules, on the hindwing the band itself is traversed by a line of obscure pale lunules; finally on the hindwing there is a subterminal series of internally white-bordered black spots followed by an obscure ochraceous terminal line, and above the tornal angle a slender transverse black line from vein 1 to the dorsal margin. Wingspan 64–85 mm. =Variation= \\"The species exhibits considerable seasonal variation, especially in South and North India; for we find that the specimens obtained in March and April in North and North-west India have the discal band much widened and the underside pale, while the individuals flying in May and June have the band narrower, and those found in Sikkim from August to November have it narrowest. In South India there are two well distinguished forms, the one corresponding to the spring form of North India, but with the band less broad and representing most likely the dry-season brood, respectively a form that inhabits dry districts, and the second having the band narrower and the underside brighter in tint. In Burma broad-banded, pale specimens occur also, besides narrow-banded ones...... The differences exhibited by the pale and the narrow-banded forms have often been treated as being of specific value; for instance, the pale South Indian form has been described as E. agrarius, while the darker form is referred to as E. samatha; the North Indian spring form has been designated as E. hamasta, the form May to June as E. bharata, and the summer form as E. athamas.....As the species is so susceptible to climatical differences, it is self-evident that the individuals caught in the same month at the same locality, but in different years, are not always identical in the width of the band, and that, further, in different localities of the same country one may meet with somewhat different forms of athamas in one year, and identical forms in another year. This one must bear in mind in working with the individuals of athamas from a certain country.\\"Rothschild and Jordan fide Bingham (1905). \\"Messrs. Rothschild and Jordan in their monograph of Charaxes and allied Prionopterous genera divide the forms of athamas (then placed in genus Eulepis) occurring within our limits into two subspecies—(1) E. athamas athamas, the Northern and Eastern race, with three seasonal forms; and (2) E. athamas agrarius, the Southern Indian and Ceylon race, with two seasonal forms. The differences between the subspecies seem to not sufficient to necessitate detailed descriptions in the present work. Following Messrs. Rothschild and Jordan, I keep, with much doubt, however, the next form separate from athamas, of which it is possibly only a dimorph.\\" C. & R. Felder described Charaxes bharata in 1867 which was later considered as a synonym of this species. A molecular phylogenetic work (Toussaint et al. 2015) has suggested this to be a distinct species. Caterpillar Pupa =Caterpillar= \\"Elongated, slug-shaped, dark green; head large, wide and surmounted by four divergent curved fleshy spinous processes; anal segment with two short naked terminal points; the segments with an oblique yellowish-white lateral stripe, most prominent on the 7th, 9th and 11th segments, and beneath these a lower series of small white spots.\\" (Moore.) =Pupa= \\"Thick, cylindrically oval; green streaked with white; dorsum and thorax convex; head broad, truncated, obtusely pointed in front.\\" (Moore.)

He joined the Nazi Party in 1930, and, when they gained power with the appointment of Adolf Hitler as Chancellor in 1933, he became Oberpräsident of the Prussian Province of Hesse-Nassau. However, he fell out with the Nazis, was arrested in 1943, dismissed the following year and was sent to the Flossenbürg concentration camp, then Dachau, where he remained until being transported to Tyrol by the SS, where he was liberated by Wehrmacht forces on 30 April 1945Die Befreiung der Sonder- und Sippenhäftlinge in Südtirol and then arrested by U.S. forces on 4 May 1945, being interned until 1947. He was a grandson of Frederick III, German Emperor, and a great-grandson of Queen Victoria, as well as the son-in- law to Victor Emmanuel III of Italy. His relative Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh was named after him. Early life Philipp was born at Schloss Rumpenheim in Offenbach, the third son of Prince Frederick Charles of Hesse and of his wife Princess Margaret of Prussia (sister of the German Emperor Wilhelm II). Philipp had a younger twin brother Wolfgang, as well as two older brothers and two other younger twin brothers. As a child, Philipp had an English governess. In 1910, he was sent to Britain to attend school in Bexhill-on-Sea. After returning to Germany, he attended a Musterschule in Frankfurt and then the Realgymnasium in Potsdam. He was the only one of the brothers who did not attend a military academy. At the beginning of the First World War, Philipp enlisted in the Hessian Dragoon-Regiment Nr. 24 along with his older brother Maximilian. They served first in Belgium where Maximilian was killed in October. In 1915 and 1916, Philipp served on the Eastern Front in what is now Ukraine. He held the rank of lieutenant (an extremely low rank considering his princely background) and was mostly responsible for the procurement of munitions. In 1917, he served on the Hindenburg Line, before returning to Ukraine where he experienced active combat and was wounded. In 1916, Philipp's oldest brother Friedrich Wilhelm died (in World War I) and Philipp became second in line to succeed his uncle as Head of the Electoral House of Hesse. In October 1918, Philipp's father was elected king of Finland. It was intended that Philipp would eventually succeed his father as Head of the House of Hesse, while his (younger) twin brother Wolfgang would be heir to the Finnish throne. The plans for a Finnish monarchy, however, soon came to an abrupt end with the defeat of Germany; Finland became a republic in July 1919. After the war, Philipp enlisted in the Übergangsheer (the Transitional Army) which was successful in defending against communist and socialist action. From 1920 to 1922, he attended the Technical University in Darmstadt where he studied art history and architecture. He made several visits to Greece where his aunt Princess Sophie of Prussia was the wife of King Constantine I. In 1922, he left university without completing a degree and took a job at the Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum in Berlin. The following year, he moved to Rome where he used his aristocratic connections to establish himself as a successful interior designer. (He had designed some furniture for the palace his father intended to occupy as King of Finland.) According to biographer Jonathan Petropoulos, Philipp was probably bisexual, and his lovers included the British poet Siegfried Sassoon.Miller, Neil (1995). Out of the Past: Gay and Lesbian History from 1869 to the Present. p. 96. Marriage and children He married Princess Mafalda of Savoy, daughter of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, on 23 September 1925 at the Castello di Racconigi near Turin. The couple had four children: *Prince Moritz, Landgrave of Hesse (6 August 1926 – 23 May 2013) he married Princess Tatiana of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg on 1 June 1964 and they were divorced on 16 October 1974. They have four children and eleven grandchildren. *Prince Heinrich Wilhelm Konstantin Viktor Franz of Hesse-Kassel (30 October 1927 – 31 January 1999). *Prince Otto Adolf of Hesse- Kassel (3 June 1937 Rome – 3 January 1998 Hanover) he married Angela von Doering (daughter of Bernd von Doering) on 5 April 1965 and they were divorced on 3 February 1969. He remarried Elisabeth Bonker on 28 December 1988 and they were divorced in 1994. *Princess Elisabeth Margarethe of Hesse-Kassel (8 October 1940 Rome, Italy) she married Count Friedrich von Oppersdorff on 28 February 1962. They have two sons: Count Friedrich Karl Philipp Wilhelm Hans Moritz Maria von Oppersdorff (1 December 1962). Count Alexander Wolfgang Johannes Georg Viktor Emanuel Maria von Oppersdorff (3 August 1965). The family lived mostly at Villa Polissena (named after Queen Polissena), part of Villa Savoia, the king of Italy's estate on the outskirts of Rome. But they also travelled frequently to Germany. Involvement with the NSDAP Philip of Hesse, second from right in the first row, in Kassel, 1933 While in Italy, Philipp fell under the influence of Fascism, or otherwise believed the Bolsheviks to be a greater threat. On his return to Germany in October 1930, he joined the National Socialist German Workers' Party. In 1932, he joined the Stormtroopers (SA, commonly referred to as the Brown Shirts), and, the following year, his younger brother Christoph joined the Schutzstaffel (SS). Later, his two other brothers, including Wolfgang, also joined the SA. Through his party membership, Philipp became a particularly close friend of Hermann Göring, the future head of the German air force (Luftwaffe). In the Stormtroopers, he held the rank of Obergruppenführer. Following the appointment of Adolf Hitler as the German Chancellor on 30 January 1933, Philipp was appointed Oberpräsident (Governor) of Hesse-Nassau in June 1933. With the electoral success of Hitler's political party, he also became a member of the Reichstag and of the Staatsrat of Prussia. Philipp played an important role in the consolidation of National Socialist rule in Germany. He introduced other aristocrats to NSDAP officials and, as son-in-law of the king of Italy, was a frequent go-between for Hitler and Benito Mussolini. He also acted as an art agent for Hitler in Italy.. On March 11th 1938 he delivered Hitler's letter of reassurance to Mussolini prior to Hitler's marching into Austria, and received a gushing call from Hitler upon the news of Mussolini's acquiescence. As governor of Hesse-Nassau, Philipp was complicit in the Aktion T4 euthanasia programme. In February 1941, Philipp signed the contract placing the sanitarium of Hadamar Clinic at the disposal of the Reich Interior Ministry. Over 10,000 mentally ill people were killed there. In 1946, Philipp was charged with murder, but the charges were later dropped. As the war progressed, the attitude of the National Socialist authorities towards members of the German princely houses changed. While at first they had been happy to use the historic family names to bolster popular support, they now decided to distance themselves even from those princes who had supported them. In late April 1943, Philipp was ordered to report to Hitler's headquarters, where he stayed for most of the next four months. In May 1943, Hitler issued the \\"Decree Concerning Internationally Connected Men\\" declaring that princes could not hold positions in the party, state, or armed forces. The arrest of Mussolini by Philipp's father-in-law King Victor Emanuel in July 1943 made Phillip's position even more difficult. Hitler believed that Philipp and his family were complicit in Mussolini's downfall. On 8 September 1943, Philipp was arrested. He was stripped of his membership in the party and dismissed from the Luftwaffe. On 25 January 1944, his political disgrace became public when he was dismissed from his office as Oberpräsident of Hesse-Nassau. In September 1943, Philipp was sent to Flossenbürg concentration camp. He was placed in solitary confinement and was not permitted any contact with the outside world. He was, however, granted certain privileges: wearing civilian clothes and eating the same food as the guards. Philipp's wife Mafalda was arrested and placed under military custody in Rome. She was sent to Munich and Berlin for questioning and eventually to Buchenwald concentration camp where she was housed next to an armaments factory. In August 1944, the factory was bombed by the Allies. Mafalda was seriously injured and died several days later following a belatedSee german wikipedia on Malfalda: delayed removal of arm cost her life. operation by camp medical staff. Moritz and Philipp of Hesse at the wedding of Princess Maria Pia of Savoy and Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia. Cascais, February 1955 As the Allies advanced into Germany in April 1945, Philipp was transferred to the Dachau concentration camp. After only ten days, he was transferred to Tyrol to Hotel \\"Bachmann\\" along with about 140 other prominent prisoners (for example Kurt Schuschnigg, Bogislaw von Bonin, Hjalmar Schacht, Martin Niemöller, Georg Thomas, and Alexander von Falkenhausen), freed by the Wehrmacht on 30 April 1945 (SS-Obergruppenführer Karl Wolff received a telephone call from the SS guards and ordered them to hand over the prisoners to the German army officers Hauptmann Wichard von Alvensleben and Hauptmann Gebhard von Alvensleben), where he was then arrested by U.S. troops on 4 May 1945 in Niederdorf in the Italian Dolomites.Peter Koblank: Die Befreiung der Sonder- und Sippenhäftlinge in Südtirol, Online- Edition Mythos Elser 2006 After the war On account of his former position as Governor of Hesse-Nassau, Philipp was held by the Allies first on the island of Capri and then at a series of other detention centres until released in 1947. On 28 May 1940, Philipp succeeded his father as Head of the Electoral House of Hesse. In 1968, upon the death of his distant agnatic relative, Prince Louis of Hesse and by Rhine (who was also his second cousin as Philipp's mother and Louis' father were grandchildren of Queen Victoria), Philipp succeeded to the total headship of the entire House of Hesse, including grand ducal Hesse (Hesse and by Rhine/Hesse-Darmstadt). Louis had nominally adopted Philipp's son Moritz, who at that time inherited the Hessian and by-Rhine properties, including remarkable cultural collections: for the first time since the division of Hesse into branches after the death of Philip the Magnanimous in 1567, all the branches of the house of Hesse were reunited again. Philipp died in Rome, Italy, in 1980.

He is known in the west as Yone Noguchi. He was the father of noted sculptor Isamu Noguchi. Biography =Early life in Japan= Noguchi was born in what is now part of the city of Tsushima, near Nagoya.Edward Marx, Yone Noguchi: The Stream of Fate, vol. 1 (Santa Barbara: Botchan Books, 2019), 46. . He attended Keio University in Tokyo, where he was exposed to the works of Thomas Carlyle and Herbert Spencer, and also expressed interests in haiku and Zen. He lived for a time in the home of Shiga Shigetaka, editor of the magazine Nihonjin, but left before graduating to travel to San Francisco in November 1893. =California= Joaquin Miller circa 1898 Noguchi arrived in San Francisco on November 19, 1893.Marx, Yone Noguchi: The Stream of Fate, 1: 86 There, he joined a newspaper run by Japanese exiles associated with the Freedom and People's Rights Movement and worked as a domestic servant. He spent some months at Palo Alto, California studying at a preparatory school for Stanford University but returned to journalistic work in San Francisco during the Sino-Japanese War. On a visit to the Oakland hillside home of Joaquin Miller after the war ended, Noguchi decided his true vocation was to be a poet. Miller welcomed and encouraged Noguchi and introduced him to other San Francisco Bay area bohemians, including Gelett Burgess (who published Noguchi's first verses in his magazine, The Lark), Ina Coolbrith, Edwin Markham, Adeline Knapp, Blanche Partington, and Charles Warren Stoddard. Noguchi weathered a plagiarism scandal in 1896 to publish two books of poetry in 1897, and remained an important fixture of the Bay Area literary scene until his departure to the East Coast in May of 1900. =Further travels= Stopping in Chicago for several weeks, Noguchi befriended artist William Denslow, writer Onoto Watanna, and journalist Frank Putnam, and was invited to write his impressions of the city for the Chicago Evening Post. He initially found New York unwelcoming. In September 1900 he made his long-awaited visit to Charles Warren Stoddard in Washington D.C. As \\"After many years of passionate correspondence across long distances,\\" writes historian Amy Sueyoshi, \\"they had finally consummated their affection for one another in person.\\"Sueyoshi, Queer Compulsions, 58. Yone Noguchi, \\"In the Bungalow with Charles Warren Stoddard: A Protest Against Modernism,\\" National Magazine 21 (December 1904), 304-308. Noguchi says in this article that the meeting with Stoddard took place \\"one Spring day\\" in 1897 in Stoddard's Washington, D.C., \\"bungalow.\\" From 1900 to 1904, Noguchi's primary base was New York City. There, with the help of editor and future lover Léonie Gilmour, he completed work on his first novel, The American Diary of a Japanese Girl, and a sequel, The American Letters of a Japanese Parlor-Maid. Yone Noguchi in 1903 The American Diary of a Japanese Girl Noguchi then sailed to England, where (with the help of his artist friend Yoshio Markino) he self-published and promoted his third book of poetry, From the Eastern Sea, and formed connections with leading literary figures like William Michael Rossetti, Laurence Binyon, William Butler Yeats, Thomas Hardy, Laurence Housman, Arthur Symons and the young Arthur Ransome. His London success brought him some attention on his return to New York in 1903, and he formed productive new friendships with American writers like Edmund Clarence Stedman, Zona Gale, and even Mary MacLane, but he continued to have difficulty publishing in the United States. He spent much of the summer of 1903 selling curios at Kushibiki and Arai's \\"Japan by Night\\" installation at Madison Square Garden, “doing a pretty good business, selling things between 7 and 12 dollars a night,” telling Stoddard it was “awfully jolly to do such a thing upon the roof full of fresh air and music.”Marx, Yone Noguchi, I:324. This changed with the onset of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, when Noguchi's writings on various aspects of Japanese culture were suddenly in great demand among magazine editors. He was able to publish a number of seminal articles at this time, including \\"A Proposal to American Poets,\\" in which he advised American poets to \\"try Japanese hokku.\\"Noguchi, Yone, \\"A Proposal to American Poets,\\" Reader 3:3 (Feb. 1904): 248. =Romantic entanglements= While in the United States, Noguchi became romantically involved with Charles Warren Stoddard, Léonie Gilmour and Ethel Armes. He had begun an amorous correspondence with Stoddard while still in California, and acknowledged that they slept in the same bed when he visited Stoddard in Washington, D.C. in 1900. He had met Ethel Armes at Stoddard's by Christmas 1901.Marx, Yone Noguchi: The Stream of Fate, 1: 259. He had hired Léonie Gilmour as an English teacher and editor in February 1901. By the end of 1903 Noguchi was secretly married to Gilmour and secretly engaged to Armes.Marx, Yone Noguchi: The Stream of Fate, 1: 304, 338. Stoddard, when informed about the Armes engagement, repeatedly begged Noguchi to end it. Charles_Warren_Stoddard.jpgStoddard Lgilmour1.jpgGilmour Ethel_Armes_1915.jpgArmes Having (he thought) ended his brief, secret marriage to Léonie Gilmour in the early months of 1904, Noguchi made plans to return to Japan and marry Ethel Armes.Marx, Yone Noguchi: The Stream of Fate, 1: 383-92. At this point, the Russo-Japanese War was in progress and Armes, now in Birmingham, Alabama had taken over as Noguchi's editor amid a greatly increased demand for Noguchi's articles on Japanese topics. =Return to Japan= Keio University Library 1912. Noguchi returned to Japan in August 1904, and became a professor of English at his alma mater Keio University the following year, but his marriage plans were spoiled when it became known that Léonie Gilmour had given birth to Noguchi's son (the future sculptor Isamu Noguchi) in Los Angeles. He moved to the Koishikawa neighborhood of Tokyo in November 1905, and published an anthology of prose poetry in English, The Summer Cloud, shortly thereafter. From November 1906 to January 1908, Noguchi wrote a literary criticism column almost every week for the Japan Times, among the more notable of which was the November 3, 1907 \\"Mr. Yeats and the No,\\" advising William Butler Yeats to study the Noh drama. \\"He has been attempting to reform and strengthen the Western stage through his own little plays which are built on Irish legend or history; and so far, in his own way, he is successful. I feel happy to think that he would find his own ideal in our No performance, if he should see and study it.\\" After studying Ernest Fenollosa's Noh translations with Ezra Pound, Yeats staged his first Noh-style play, At the Hawk's Well, in 1916, eliciting Noguchi's approval in another Japan Times column.\\"Yeats and the Noh Play of Japan,\\" Japan Times, 2 Dec. 1917. In 1907, Léonie and Isamu joined Noguchi in Tokyo, but the reunion proved short-lived, mainly because Noguchi had already married a Japanese woman, Matsu Takeda, before their arrival. He and Léonie separated for good in 1910,Marx, Léonie Gilmour, 236 although Léonie and Isamu continued to live in Japan. Noguchi continued to publish extensively in English after his return to Japan, becoming a leading interpreter of Japanese culture to Westerners, and of Western culture to the Japanese. His 1909 poem collection, The Pilgrimage, was widely admired, as was a 1913 collection of essays, Through the Torii. =Lectures abroad= Noguchi photographed by Alvin Langdon Coburn, 1913 In 1913, he made his second trip to Britain (via Marseille and Paris) to lecture on Japanese poetry at Magdalen College, Oxford at the invitation of poet laureate, Robert Bridges, also giving lectures to the Japan Society of London and reading at the Poetry Bookshop. While in London, he met with George Bernard Shaw, W. B. Yeats, Ezra Pound, Laurence Binyon, Arthur Symons, Sarojini Naidu, and numerous other noted literary figures, and also investigated the latest trends in British modern art, spending time with Roger Fry, Alvin Langdon Coburn, Joseph Pennell, Jacob Epstein and Henri Gaudier- Brzeska. In April the following year, while in Paris, he also met with Tōson Shimazaki who happened to be travelling in Europe at the time. Noguchi traveled back to Japan via Berlin and Moscow using the Trans-Siberian Railway. A collection of literary essays, Through the Torii had appeared at the time of Noguchi's arrival in Britain, and while there, he arranged the publication of The Spirit of Japanese Poetry, The Spirit of Japanese Art and The Story of Yone Noguchi. In 1919–20, Noguchi made a transcontinental lecture tour of America under the aegis of the James B. Pond Lyceum Bureau, speaking at Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Chicago and the University of Utah, and the University of Toronto, among other places. =Japanese poet and art critic= After the publication of a collection of short poems entitled Japanese Hokkus in 1920, Noguchi devoted most of his English efforts to studies of ukiyo-e and began a belated career as a Japanese language poet. Noguchi's success as a Japanese poet has been questioned by Japanese scholars; Norimasa Morita states that Noguchi \\"struggled to make a literary reputation for himself in Japan\\" and that \\"most of his Japanese poems received no critical or popular recognition\\".Norimasa Morita, \\"Yone Noguchi (1875–1947)\\" in Britain and Japan: Biographical Portraits, v. 8, ed. Hugh Cortazzi (Folkstone, Kent: Global Oriental, 2013), 415. Other scholars including Madoka Hori point to evidence of Noguchi's success such as the May 1926 Noguchi Yonejiro special number of the magazine Nippon Shijin (The Japanese Poet).Noguchi Yonejirou kinengou [Noguchi Yonejiro special number], Nippon Shijin 6:5 (May 1926). Noguchi's extensive art- historical writings produced similarly divergent reactions. A book like The Ukiyoye Primitives (1933) could delight poet and editor Marianne Moore with its \\"renovated language of unimpaired connotation\\" while severely testing the patience of Harvard art historian Benjamin Rowland, Jr., by its unfamiliar \\"manipulation of the language\\" that \\"frequently obscures the meaning of whole passages.\\" Moore thought the book \\"useful to the judge of prints\\"; not Rowland, who complained that its aesthetic judgments \\"tend toward the sentimental and are for the most part so superficial as to be of practically no value.\\" Even Rowland, though, had to commend what he thought \\"undoubtedly the finest reproductions in any work on Ukiyo-ye that has yet appeared in English.\\"Marianne Moore, \\"The Poem and the Print,\\" Poetry 43:2 (Nov. 1933): 92-95; Benjamin Rowland, Jr. \\"The Ukiyo-ye Primitives,\\" Nation (New York) 139 (18 July 1934): 77-78. All of Noguchi's later books, in both Japanese and English, were published in Japan, for Noguchi encountered stiff resistance from American and British publishers in the 1930s, despite the support of a few sympathetic editors like Moore and R. A. Scott-James.Noguchi, Later Essays, 3–4. =The war years= Noguchi Yonejiro by Kimura Ihei Noguchi's politics tended to follow prevailing Japanese tendencies. In the 1920s, following the leftist turn of Taishō democracy, he published in leftist magazines like Kaizō, but the 1930s, he followed the country's turn to the right. Partly as a result of his friendship with leading Indian intellectuals like Rabindranath Tagore, Sarojini Naidu, and Rash Behari Bose, Noguchi was sent to India in 1935–36 to help gain support for Japanese objectives in East Asia, but he had little success. Noguchi and Tagore had a bitter exchange of letters in 1938 before their friendship ended over political and philosophical differences. During the Second World War, Noguchi supported the Japanese cause, advocating a no-holds-barred assault on the Western countries he had once admired. =Postwar period= In April 1945, his house in Nakano, Tokyo was destroyed in the American Bombing of Tokyo. After the war, he succeeded in reconciling with his estranged son Isamu before dying of stomach cancer on July 13, 1947. Critical evaluations Critical evaluations of Noguchi, while varying drastically, have frequently stressed the enigmatic character of his work. Arthur Symons referred to him as a \\"scarcely to be apprehended personality.\\"Symons, Arthur, \\"A Japanese Poet,\\" Saturday Review 95 (Mar 7, 1903): 302. Arthur Ransome called him \\"a poet whose poems are so separate that a hundred of them do not suffice for his expression.\\"Ransome, Arthur, \\"The Poetry of Yone Noguchi,\\" Fortnightly Review 94 (Sept. 1910): 527–33. Ezra Pound, on first reading The Pilgrimage in 1911 wrote that \\"His poems seem to be rather beautiful. I don't quite know what to think about them.\\"Pound, Omar and A. Walton Litz, eds. Ezra Pound and Dorothy Shakespear, Their Letters, 1909–1914. New York: New Directions, 1984. Nishiwaki Junzaburō wrote, \\"Most of his earlier poems have always seemed to me so terrific, so bewildering, as to startle me out of reason or system.\\"Nishiwaki Junzaburo, \\"A Note on the Poems of Mr. Noguchi,\\" Mita Bungaku 12:11 (Nov. 1921): 105–108. Noguchi was hailed in the pages of Poetry as a pioneering modernist, thanks to his early advocacy of free verse and association with modernist writers like Yeats, Ezra Pound, Richard Aldington, and John Gould Fletcher. Noguchi may be considered a cross- cultural, transnational, or cosmopolitan writer. His work may also be considered, albeit somewhat more problematically, within the national literatures of Japan and the United States (see Japanese literature, American literature). Noguchi has recently gained attention in Asian American studies due to the increasing interest in transnationalism. Yone Noguchi is played by Nakamura Shidō II in the film Leonie (2010).

It is based on the 1924 Italian play La Morte in Vacanza by Alberto Casella (1891–1957), as adapted in English for Broadway in 1929 by Walter Ferris. Synopsis After years of questioning why people fear him, Death takes on human form (Fredric March) for three days so that he can mingle among mortals and find an answer. He finds a host in Duke Lambert (Guy Standing) after revealing himself and his intentions to the Duke, and takes up temporary residence in the Duke's villa. However, events soon spiral out of control as Death falls in love with the beautiful young Grazia (Evelyn Venable). As he does so, Duke Lambert, the father of Grazia's mortal lover Corrado (Kent Taylor), begs him to give Grazia up and leave her among the living. Death must decide whether to seek his own happiness, or sacrifice it so that Grazia may live.

Time called it \\"thoughtful and delicately morbid\\", while Mordaunt Hall for The New York Times wrote that \\"it is an impressive picture, each scene of which calls for close attention\\". Richard Watts, Jr, for the New York Herald Tribune, described it as \\"An interesting, frequently striking and occasionally beautiful dramatic fantasy\\", while the Chicago Daily Tribune said that March was \\"completely submerged in probably the greatest role he has ever played.\\" Variety called it \\"the kind of story and picture that beckons the thinker, and for this reason is likely to have greater appeal among the intelligensia.\\" It praised March's performance as \\"skillful\\". John Mosher of The New Yorker wrote that the film was \\"nicely done\\", although he suggested it was \\"a little obnoxious with all its talk of being in love with death.\\" The film was a box-office disappointment for Paramount. The American Film Institute recognized the film with a nomination in its 2002 list, AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions. Remakes and adaptations * A one-hour radio adaptation of the film aired on Cecil B. DeMille's Lux Radio Theatre on March 22, 1937, starring Fredric March reprising his role as Death and his wife, actress Florence Eldridge, as Grazia. * Universal Studios, which acquired the rights to the film in 1962 following a merger with then-owners MCA, made a 1971 television production featuring Yvette Mimieux, Monte Markham, Myrna Loy, Melvyn Douglas and Bert Convy. Loy related in her biography that the production was marred by a decline in filming production standards; she described a frustrated Douglas storming off the set and returning to his home in New York when a tour guide interrupted the filming of one of his dramatic scenes to point out Rock Hudson's dressing room. * The film was remade by Universal again in 1998 as Meet Joe Black starring Brad Pitt, Claire Forlani and Anthony Hopkins. * It was adapted into a musical by Maury Yeston with the book by Peter Stone and Thomas Meehan. It began previews Off-Broadway on June 10, and officially opened on July 21, 2011, in a limited engagement through September 4, 2011, at the Laura Pels Theatre at the Harold & Miriam Steinberg Center for Theatre in a production by Roundabout Theatre Company.Jones, Kenneth.

Origin of name  This geographical area derives its name from the clan of Bhatis, who are Bhati Yaduvanshi Rajputs. The Battiana territories, traditionally controlled by the Bhatis, covered a part of modern Haryana and Punjab, and extended up to Bikaner, Rajasthan.  History  The region was devastated during the (late-14th century) invasion of the north-western parts of the Indian subcontinent by Timur. Thereafter, the regions fell under the control of the different rulers, including the Mughals, and with the weakening of the Mughals, became a part of the British Raj from mid-19th century. A district of Bhattiana was formed in 1837, but in 1858 it was transferred to the Punjab and absorbed into the Sirsa district, itself later divided up.

It sits atop a promontory opposite the Bass Rock, looking out onto the Firth of Forth. The last medieval curtain wall castle to be constructed in Scotland,Lindsay, The Castles of Scotland, p.440–442 Tantallon comprises a single wall blocking off the headland, with the other three sides naturally protected by sea cliffs. Tantallon was built in the mid 14th century by William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas. It was passed to his illegitimate son, George Douglas, later created Earl of Angus, and despite several sieges, it remained the property of his descendants for much of its history. It was besieged by King James IV in 1491, and again by his successor James V in 1528, when extensive damage was done. Tantallon saw action in the First Bishops' War in 1639, and again during Oliver Cromwell's invasion of Scotland in 1651, when it was once more severely damaged. It was sold by the Marquis of Douglas in 1699 to Hew Dalrymple, Lord North Berwick and the ruin is today in the care of Historic Environment Scotland. Construction Plan of the inner court of Tantallon Castle Tantallon is a unique construction within Scotland, the defences comprising only a single large wall securing a coastal promontory. The south-east, north- east, and north-west approaches are naturally defended by steep sea cliffs, and were only ever protected by relatively small defensive walls. To the south-west, a massive curtain wall blocks off the end of the promontory, which forms the inner courtyard. The curtain wall is built of the local red sandstone, and has a tower at either end and a heavily fortified gatehouse in the centre, all of which provided residential accommodation.Tabraham, Scotland's Castles, pp.65–69 A north range of buildings, containing a hall, completed the main part of the castle, enclosing a courtyard around .Salter, The Castles of Lothian and the Borders, pp.86–88 In total, the buildings of the castle provided around of accommodation. In its form, Tantallon follows on from the 12th-century castles of Bothwell and Kildrummy, as a castle of enceinte, or curtain wall castle. It was the last of this type to be built in Scotland, as the smaller tower house was becoming increasingly popular. For example, Threave Castle, built at around the same time by Earl William's cousin Archibald the Grim, is a much more modest tower. There are also similarities between Tantallon and \\"courtyard\\" castles, such as Doune, which also dates from the late 14th century, and is entered via a passage beneath a strong keep tower.MacGibbon and Ross, The Castellated and Domestic Architecture of Scotland, vol.I, pp.429–435 =Curtain wall= Curtain wall, with the gatehouse in the centre The curtain wall is over high, thick, and around long. There are several small chambers within the walls, and stairs with arched ceilings accessing the parapet walk.McWilliam, Lothian, except Edinburgh, pp.444–6 This parapet walk, beneath the 16th-century crenels of the curtain wall, connects the three towers. The northwest tower, known as the Douglas Tower, was circular in plan and across, although the west side has collapsed. Seven storeys high, this tower would have formed the lord's \\"donjon\\", or keep, containing his private accommodation, and connecting to the hall in the north range. The lowest storey was a pit prison and the timber- floored chambers above were square, with vaulted garderobes or privies. The East Tower is of D-plan, with the curved face outwards, and is across. Originally consisting of five storeys, the bottom three were reduced to two after the 1528 siege, by the insertion of stone vaults. Large gun ports were also added in the basement at this time. The third floor of the tower was designed to have access to a parapet on the south-east wall, although this wall was never built. Inner court, void above entrance The central gatehouse tower is square, across, and up to high. It contained four storeys of chambers, some with canopied fireplaces, although the internal walls and floors are now missing. The main entrance ran through a passage below, protected by a drawbridge, three pairs of doors, a portcullis, and machicolations; holes in the ceiling enabling the defenders to drop missiles on to intruders below. There are two bartizans, or corner turrets, facing in toward the courtyard, where a 16th-century spiral stair gives access to the head of the curtain wall. The entrance was originally via a pointed arched gateway, flanked by round towers. A defensive barbican, or outer gate, was added in the early 14th century, and was destroyed in the 1528 siege, although fragments can still be seen. After the siege, the facade of the gatehouse was rebuilt, with more gun ports at ground level, and the gateway corridor was narrowed. The rebuilding covered up the remains of the earlier round towers, narrowed the main gate, and gave the tower rounded corners for additional strength. =Inner court= Ruins of the Douglas Tower, with the Bass Rock behind The north range of buildings, around , is connected to the Douglas Tower. The western section dates from the 14th century, and comprises the remains of the great hall, used by the lord, over the former laigh, or low, hall, used by the labourers, and later divided to form cellars. The marks of the hall's pitched roof can be seen on the inside wall of the Douglas Tower. The 16th-century eastern section contained a bakehouse and further private chambers, and has partially collapsed into the sea. Only a small section of the other walls remains to the east, and contains a postern gate, giving access to the sea through a cleft in the cliffs below. The well is deep, and was re-excavated in the 19th century. North range, seen from the gatehouse =Outer court= Alongside the curtain wall is a deep, rock-cut ditch, with a larger second ditch around away, defining the outer court of the castle. Within the outer ditch are two mounds, which Charles McKean suggests may conceal 16th-century caponiers, defensive positions allowing covering fire along the trench. McKean notes that Sir James Hamilton of Finnart, the King's Master of Works, and a noted military engineer who built Scotland's only known caponiers at Craignethan and Blackness, was present with the King during the 1528 siege, and worked at Tantallon afterwards.McKean, The Scottish Chateau, pp.49–50 A stone-fronted mound formerly ran along the outside of the ditch, although only a section of the outer wall survives, at the south end, terminating in a two-storey round tower. This tower, with several gun ports, was built prior to the siege of 1528, and may have been inspired by the new artillery defences at nearby Dunbar Castle.Tabraham, Scotland's Castles, p.102 A 17th-century \\"lectern\\" type doocot, or pigeon house, is the only building within the outer court. Beyond the outer ditch is a 17th-century ravelin, a triangular earthen artillery defence, and the remains of a third, smaller, ditch. History Inner face of the curtain wall from the north range A map of the area, dated to before 1300, shows a castellated site with the name of \\"Dentaloune\\",Richardson, Tantallon Castle, p.12 possibly a corruption of the Brythonic din talgwn or \\"high-fronted fortress\\".Johnston, Place Names of Scotland, p.307 The barony of North Berwick, including Tantallon, was in the possession of the Earls of Fife at this time. =Early history= In 1346, William Douglas (c. 1327–1384), nephew of Robert the Bruce's companion Sir James Douglas, had returned to Scotland, from France, to claim his inheritance as chief of the name of Douglas. By murdering his godfather, Sir William Douglas of Liddesdale, William became the undisputed head of the House of Douglas. He was created Earl of Douglas in 1358. It is not clear how Douglas came to possess Tantallon, but in a correspondence of 1374, he refers to it as \\"our castle of Temptaloun\\".Fawcett, Scottish Architecture, p.16 Douglas may have been made castellan of Tantallon, as a tenant of Isabella, Countess of Fife, and it appears that he built the present castle either shortly before, or shortly after his elevation to the peerage, to reflect his new-found status.Tabraham, Tantallon Castle, p.16 It was intended as a status symbol, although it followed the medieval curtain wall type, which at the time was becoming outmoded and superseded by the tower house. The Douglases continued to hold the lands of Tantallon as tenants of Robert Stewart, Earl of Fife (c.1340-1420), from 1371 until 1372, when he resigned the title in favour of his son, Murdoch Stewart. Tantallon was the home of William Douglas' sister- in-law and mistress, Margaret Stewart, 4th Countess of Angus, the mother of his illegitimate son, George Douglas (1380–1403). In 1377, the Earl of Angus made his close friend, Alan de Lawedre of The Bass, Constable of Tantallon Castle, an office he held until at least 1389.Fraser, The Douglas Book, vol.III, p.398 In 1388, when the 2nd Earl of Douglas died, the Earl of Fife claimed the lands of Tantallon, and confirmed the Countess' right to live there.Richardson, Tantallon Castle, pp.12–13 Several attempts were made to dislodge the Countess, but an agreement was formalised by Parliament in April 1389, and George Douglas was recognised as Earl of Angus, being the heir of his mother.Brown, The Black Douglases, pp.83,86 View from Seacliff Harbour, showing the fortifications blocking the promontory =The Red Douglases= The Barony of North Berwick, surrounding Tantallon, stayed with the Earldom of Fife, but despite the Earl's claim, the castle passed outright into the Douglas family, and was inherited by George Douglas, illegitimate son of the Earl of Douglas, who also inherited his mother's Earldom of Angus in 1389. This was the start of the division in the House of Douglas. Archibald the Grim became head of the main line, known as the \\"Black Douglases\\". George Douglas was the progenitor of the \\"Red Douglases\\".Maxwell, A History of the House of Douglas, vol.II, pp.3–5 In 1397, George Douglas married Princess Mary Stewart, daughter of King Robert III of Scotland, allying the Red Douglases with the Royal House of Stewart. From 1425 to 1433, Isabella, Countess of Lennox, the widow of the executed Duke of Albany, was warded at Tantallon. In 1429, another royal enemy, Alexander, Lord of the Isles, was held at Tantallon until his reconciliation with King James I two years later. The 3rd Earl of Angus (1426–1446) made Tantallon his main residence, and was in rebellion from 1443 until his death. He raided the Black Douglas lands of Abercorn, leading to retaliation and his forfeiture in 1446, a few months before his death.Richardson, Tantallon Castle, p.13 In 1452, King James II granted Tantallon to the 4th Earl of Angus, brother of the 3rd Earl of Angus, who led the Royal force that defeated the Black Douglases at the Battle of Arkinholm in May 1455.Richardson, Tantallon Castle, p.14 The Red Douglases, in the person of Archibald \\"Bell-the-Cat\\" (1453–1514), the 5th Earl, turned against the Royal house in 1482. Around 1490, Angus struck a treasonable deal with Henry VII of England, against James IV of Scotland. On 11 October 1491, Tantallon Castle was besieged by James IV, with guns sent from Edinburgh and Linlithgow, and crossbows and culverins (a primitive type of hand gun) from Leith. However, Angus submitted and the castle did not suffer extensive damage. By 1493 Angus was back in favour as Chancellor of Scotland. In 1498 the Constable of Tantallon Castle was Patrick Mathewson of Little Spot.Balfour Paul, James, editor, The Register of the Great Seal of Scotland 1424-1513, reprinted 1984, charter 2654, p.563-4. James V of Scotland, who successfully besieged Tantallon in 1528 =The Siege of 1528= In 1514, Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus (1490–1557) married James IV's widow Margaret Tudor, daughter of Henry VII, and Regent of Scotland for her infant son James V. The couple unsuccessfully conspired to take the young King to England, sparking off civil war. The Regency was handed to John Stewart, Duke of Albany, who seized Tantallon in 1515, although it was returned when Angus made his peace. Margaret Tudor stopped at Tantallon during her journey to England in 1515.Ken Emond, The Minority of James V (Edinburgh, 2019), pp. 53-4. She left valuable costume and jewels behind at Tantallon, including several borders for hoods called \\"chaffrons\\" and a diamond that had been a present from Louis XII of France.Thomas Thomson, Collection of Inventories (Edinburgh, 1815), pp. 21-28 In 1525, Angus, with support from Henry VIII of England, staged a virtual coup d'état, taking custody of the young King, and becoming Chancellor. But, in 1528, the sixteen-year-old James V escaped, and, joining his mother at Stirling, pronounced Angus attainted, banishing him to \\"north of the Spey\\".Richardson, Tantallon Castle, p.16 Angus instead retreated to Tantallon, and then to England. The castle was seized by the King, but Angus managed to return and refortify his stronghold. On 23 October 1528, King James laid siege to Tantallon which was defended by Angus's servant Simon Penango.Richardson, Tantallon Castle, p.17 Angus himself remained at Billie in the Merse.Reid, David ed., Hume of Godscroft's History of the House of Angus, vol. 1, STS (2005), 97-8. James V borrowed the guns from Dunbar Castle which was held by the French garrison of the Duke Albany. According to Pitscottie, the guns supplied by Captain Maurice of Dunbar were Thrawinmouth, Mow and her marrow (partner), two great botcards, two moyanes, two double falcons, four quarter falcons, with powder, gunners and bullets. James left three hostages with Maurice in pledge for the guns.Lindsay of Pitscottie, Robert, The History of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1778), pp. 222-3, Thrawinmouth was used at St Andrews Castle in 1547. The castle was bombarded with this cannon for 20 days, although the King's guns could not be brought close enough to the walls to do substantive damage, due to the deep outer ditch. The King lifted the siege and returned to Edinburgh, at which point Angus counterattacked and captured the King's artillery and his principal gunner David Falconer was killed. Angus wrote to the Earl of Northumberland, that James V had brought Scottish and French engineers, \\"ingenious men\\", to the siege without success, \\"as can be rememberit, thar was nevir sa mekill (so much) pane travell expensis and diligence done and maid for the wynning of ane house, and the sammyn (same) escaip in Scotland, sen it was first inhabit.\\" State Papers Henry Eighth, vol. 4 part 4 (London, 1836), p. 521. In May 1529, Angus fled to England, leaving the castle to James. Simon Penango, having received no further supplies or reinforcements from Angus made terms and surrendered the castle. Tantallon was retained as a Royal fortress until James V's death in 1542, when Angus returned and recovered it. To repair damage sustained during the siege, the King set about rebuilding and strengthening the castle. First, Sir Thomas Erskine of Brechin, the king's secretary, was made the keeper and organised strengthening and repair works. He was at the castle in July 1533.James Balfour Paul, Accounts of the Treasurer: 1531-1538, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1905), p. 137. Then the castle was given to the king's eldest illegitimate son James.The Spalding Club Miscellany, vol. 2 (Aberdeen, 1842), pp. 188-9, James V to Erskine, 23 February 1535. Soon after, Oliver Sinclair was installed as captain, and the surviving accounts for the period 1537–1539 record that George Sempill was the master mason, carrying out the repairs under the direction of John Scrimgeour, the King's Master of Works.Richardson, Tantallon Castle, p.19 The front of the gatehouse was rebuilt, and the East Tower strengthened. Wide-mouthed gun holes were punched through the landward walls of the tower, and a crenellated parapet was added to the curtain wall.The Listed Building Report for Tantallon dates the repair works to 1556. To strengthen the great landward curtain wall several chambers and passages within were filled with masonry, and can be seen today. Pitscottie described this operation: \\"the king caused masons come and ranforce the wallis, quhilkis war left waste before as transis (passages), and through-passages; and maid all massie work, to mak it the more strang.\\"Lindsay Pitscottie, Robert, Chronicles of Scotland, vol. 2 Edinburgh (1814), 340. =The Rough Wooing= On Angus' return in 1542, he was still in contact with Henry VIII, and allowed Sir Ralph Sadler, English ambassador to Scotland, to reside at Tantallon during the attempts to negotiate a marriage between the infant Mary, Queen of Scots, and Edward, Prince of Wales in 1542–43.Richardson, Tantallon Castle, pp.20–21 It has been claimed that when the Earl of Hertford invaded Scotland in 1544, during the ensuing War of the Rough Wooing, Tantallon was bypassed by the English army, due to the Earl's English sympathies.Mackay, Investigating Tantallon Castle, p.2 However, Hertford was keen to put an English garrison in Tantallon and negotiated unsuccessfully with one of the keepers, Alexander Jardine.State Papers Henry VIII, 5:4 (London, 1836), pp. 379-80 The nearby castle of Oliver Sinclair was amongst places burnt by the returning English army in May 1544.Grafton, Richard, A Chronicle at Large, 1569, vol. 2 (London, 1809), p. 491. Tantallon was also unmolested in 1547.Patten, William, The Expedition into Scotland, 1547. Angus was finally imprisoned at Blackness Castle in 1544, after which he changed sides to support the Scottish cause. The gunners of Tantallon were rewarded in August 1548, after firing on English ships during an engagement in the Firth of Forth.Richardson, Tantallon Castle, pp.22–23 =Later 16th century= Angus died at Tantallon in January 1557, and the castle was seized by the Queen Regent, Mary of Guise. It was given over to the Laird of Craigmillar, and repairs were carried out the following year. In 1558, George Drummond of Blair was keeper of Tantallon, with a garrison of seven horsemen and 22 soldiers.Richardson, Tantallon Castle, p.23 James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton took control in 1565, on behalf of his nephew, the young 8th Earl of Angus, but the following year, Mary, Queen of Scots, gave the Captaincy to Robert Lauder of the Bass, and his son, Robert Lauder, younger of the Bass The appointment of the Lauders followed the surrender of Sir William Douglas of Lochleven, who was one of those charged with the murder of Queen Mary's favourite, David Rizzio, in March 1566.Young, The Parliaments of Scotland, vol.I, p.407 Mary visited Tantallon herself in November 1566. Andrew Hume was Captain of Tantallon Castle in 1577.Harvey & MacLeod, Calendar of Writs preserved at Yester House 1166-1625, No. 798. The 8th Earl of Angus was sent into exile in England in 1581, and left some of best furnishings from Tantallon with Lord Hunsdon at Berwick-upon-Tweed, including a bed of green velvet and damask, a bed of crimson velvet \\"fair embroidered with images and beasts of gold\\", and a bed of cloth of silver and cloth of gold.William Boyd, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1910), p. 182-3. He had a brewhouse in the castle repaired in September 1583.William Boyd, Calendar of State Papers Scotland: 1581-1583, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1910), p. 623. In April 1584 the keepers of Fast Castle, Innerwick, and Tantallon were commanded to surrender their castles to the crown.David Masson, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1578-1585, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1880), pp. 649, 657. Following the death of the 8th Earl in 1588, the Earls of Angus usually lived elsewhere, and had little to do with Tantallon Castle.Tabraham, Tantallon Castle, p.25 In February 1592 an inventory was made of the furnishings and armaments.Margaret H. B. Sanderson, A Kindly Place? (East Linton, 2002), p. 91: National Records of Scotland GD16/37/13. In July James VI took possession of the castle and Alexander Home of North Berwick was installed as captain.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1589-1593, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 729. In September 1596 the captain of Tantallon, Stephen Bruntfield, was killed by James Carmichael, a son of Sir John Carmichael, Captain of the Royal Guard. Bruntsfield's brother Adam subsequently killed Carmichael in single combat.Robert Chambers, Domestic Annals of Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1858), p. 285: John Mackenzie, A chronicle of the Kings of Scotland from Fergus the First, to James the Sixth (Edinburgh, 1830), pp. 156-7 William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus took up residence in the castle on 5 November 1608.Alexander Curle, 'Kitchen and Buttery Accounts of the Earl of Angus's Household in Glasgow and the Canongate', Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries Scotland (Edinburgh, 1909), pp. 191-207. General Monck, who successfully besieged Tantallon in 1651 =17th century= After a period of peace, Tantallon again saw military action during the Bishops' Wars in 1639. The Douglas family had remained Catholic after the Scottish Reformation, incurring the wrath of the Presbyterian Covenanters, who opposed Charles I's attempts to interfere with the Scottish Church. In 1639, the Covenanters captured Tantallon while William, newly created Marquess of Douglas, was in Edinburgh. 1651 siege In 1650, during the Third English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell's Parliamentarian forces invaded Scotland, taking control of the south of the country after their victory at Dunbar in September. In February 1651, Cromwell found his lines of communication under attack from a small group of Royalists based at Tantallon. This group, led by Alexander Seton, comprised just 91 men. Despite this, Cromwell's retaliation was to send 2,000 to 3,000 troops under General Monck, together with much of the artillery he had in Scotland, and lay siege to Tantallon. Seton was ennobled by Charles II, as Viscount of Kingston, on 14 February, during the siege. After twelve days of bombardment with cannon a breach was made in the Douglas Tower. The defenders were compelled to surrender, but only after quarter had been granted to them in recognition of their bravery.Tabraham, Tantallon Castle, pp.26–27 After the siege Tantallon was left in ruins: it was never repaired or inhabited afterwards. The siege of Tantallon was also interesting in that the Commonwealth land forces were supported by the Commonwealth Navy. =Later history= View of Tantallon Castle and the Bass Rock by Alexander Nasmyth, 18th-19th century James Douglas, 2nd Marquess of Douglas, the 12th Earl of Angus, was forced, due to gambling debts accrued by himself and his father, to consolidate his estates. The ruins of Tantallon were sold, in 1699, to Sir Hew Dalrymple, the President of the Court of Session, who also owned the Barony of North Berwick, the Bass, Fidra and other properties in the area. Dalrymple allowed the castle to decay further, and to be quarried to a certain extent for stone. Sir Walter Scott described the castle at length in his 1808 epic poem Marmion. Some restoration was carried out by the Dalrymples in the late 19th century, and in 1924, the castle was handed over to the UK Government's Office of Works by Dalrymple's descendant, Sir Hew Hamilton-Dalrymple, Bt. It is now in the care of Historic Environment Scotland as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. In popular culture The ruins of Tantallon Castle are featured in the 2013 thriller Under the Skin from British director Jonathan Glazer. Actors Scarlett Johansson and Michael Moreland are depicted on the roof, then cautiously descending the narrow inside staircase.

It is located on the southern bank of the Ganga River, a commonplace for Hindu cremation rituals. The place is well known for Umanath, a Shiva temple on the shores of the Ganga and the Alakhnath Temple. Lai, a sweet from Barh that looks like laddu, is known for its rich taste. Barh is also known as Chhitorgarh because Barh has maximum number of Rajput (caste).  Demographics  , Barh had a total population of 316,348 residents, with 162,354 males and 153,994 females. Barh has an average literacy rate of 100%.  Politics  Barh is a part of the Munger parliamentary constituency, which forms the Bihar Legislative Assembly. It is also the oldest subdivision in India.  History  Barh has been a prominent trading satellite city in Patna, even in pre- Mughal and British periods. It was an intermediary town between the river trade in Patna and Kolkata. Numerous references to Barh were found in travelogues by European visitors and historical chronicles of Islamic historians. Peace Treaty of Barh In 1495, after the sack of Patna, Sikandar Lodi advanced towards Bengal, but a non-aggression pact was made between the Delhi and the Bengal armies. It was decided that the territory to the east of Barh would be controlled by Bengal's ruler, while those to the west would be controlled by the Delhi empire. Sarai During the Mughal period, Barh had a large sarai with 200 rooms for travelers/traders built by Sher Shah Suri.http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/18028/7/07_chapter%201.pdf Sufi saints Barh was a popular site for Sufi culture. An important Qadri saint was Diwan Syed Muhammad Jafar Binodpuri of Barh, who had prominent followers during the 1670–1690s. Resistance to Maratha armies In 1748, Alivardi Khan (Nawab of Bengal army) camped in Barh and defeated the Marathas (under Mir Habib) at Kala Diara near Bakhtiarpur after they sacked Patna during one of the Maratha invasions of Bengal. Mir Qasim (1763) The British took gradual control of Bihar after the Battle of Plassey (1757). Mir Qasim (son-in-law of Mir Jafar who had betrayed Siraj ud-Daulah during the Battle of Plassey) executed the Jagat Seth before raiding Patna which had been occupied by the British. He eventually lost the Battle of Buxar, and Barh and Patna were taken into the British Empire. Rennell's Survey In 1776, James Rennell, also called the \\"Father of Indian Geography\\", surveyed Bengal and listed prominent destinations. Barh is prominently displayed on a 1776 map, implying it was a prominent trading destination. A zoomed view of Rennel's 1776 Bengal map focussing on Barh(Bar) and nearby locations Trade Barh was an important transit point for the saltpeter trade, which was widely used in explosives, glassmaking, and fertilizers. Barh was also known for its high-quality chameli ka tel (jasmine oil) exports. A zoomed-in map of barh in 1812 as described in buchanan travelogue Barh Railway line On 10 November 1877, the Barh railway station was opened to the public. Plague Between the 1890s to 1910, Barh and Patna were afflicted by the plague. It is believed that the 1898 plague came by sea by rats aboard infected ships, though it first appeared in the British India Steam Navigation Company's wharf. The two main factors for the spread of the plague were believed to be the high presence of rats and houses with poor hygiene and bad ventilation, an optimal environment for rats to breed. The population of the extended Barh subdivision decreased from 408,256 in 1891 to 365,327 in 1901 due to the plague. Sati's Incident In 1928, Sampati Kuer, a young widow from Berhna village, committed sati on the funeral pyre of her deceased husband. The British government suspected foul play and sentenced 10 people to prison, including her brother Murlidhar Pande, as sati was outlawed 100 years earlier by the British government.http://14.139.60.114:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/33476/1/009_King- Emperor%20v.%20Vidyasagar%20Pande%20%2874-86%29.pdf However, villagers saw the incident as miraculous and the site is commemorated as a special place of worship called Sati Sthan at the old Umanath temple in Barh.

According to Michel Foucault, \\"The hypomnemata constituted a material memory of things read, heard, or thought, thus offering these as an accumulated treasure for rereading and later meditation. They also formed a raw material for the writing of more systematic treatises in which were given arguments and means by which to struggle against some defect (such as anger, envy, gossip, flattery) or to overcome some difficult circumstance (a mourning, an exile, downfall, disgrace).\\"  Modern usage  Michel Foucault uses the word in the sense of \\"note\\", but his translators use the word \\"notebook\\", which is anachronistic (see codex and wax tablet). Concerning Seneca's discipline of self-knowledge, Foucault writes: \\"In this period there was a culture of what could be called personal writing: taking notes on the reading, conversations, and reflections that one hears or engages in oneself; keeping kinds of notebooks on important subjects (what the Greeks call 'hupomnemata'), which must be reread from time to time so as to reactualize their contents.\\"\\"The Hermeneutics of the Subject: Lectures at the College de France 1981-1982\\" Foucault, Michel, Picador, p. 500.

She was born in Orford, Suffolk and named Margaret Joan Hemingway; but when she was three years old her family moved to New Zealand, where she spent her childhood. Returning to England in her teens, she read French and English at Edinburgh University and graduated MA in 1967. Shortly after leaving university she married Michael Dias, with whom she had two daughters. The marriage broke up in the late 1970s and she moved to London. There she worked in publishing, eventually becoming Rights Manager for J.M.Dent. She had been writing poetry and prose from her youth, and in 1986 published her first novel, The Bridge, which won the Winifred Holtby Memorial Prize (presented for the best regional novel of the year). This story about an artist's conflict between his life and his art was made into a film in 1992. Her following three novels all received much critical acclaim. Victoria Glendenning wrote of her second novel, Stop House Blues (1988), that \\"it has a classic quality which will ensure its survival\\". Her third, The Postman's House (1991), was based on her own experiences of Czechoslovakia before the Velvet Revolution. Eyes, her final novel (1993), is also her most experimental, combining four stories of murder into a single span and reaching a chilling conclusion.

Architecture In architecture, an ornament may be carved into stone or wood to resemble leaves from the Mediterranean species of the Acanthus genus of plants, which have deeply cut leaves with some similarity to those of the thistle and poppy. Both Acanthus mollis and the still more deeply cut Acanthus spinosus have been claimed as the main model, and particular examples of the motif may be closer in form to one or the other species; the leaves of both are in any case, rather variable in form. The motif is found in decoration in nearly every medium. The relationship between acanthus ornament and the acanthus plant has been the subject of a long-standing controversy. Alois Riegl argued in his Stilfragen that acanthus ornament originated as a sculptural version of the palmette, and only later, began to resemble Acanthus spinosus. =Greek and Roman= In ancient Roman and ancient Greek architecture acanthus ornament appears extensively in the capitals of the Corinthian and Composite orders, and applied to friezes, dentils and other decorated areas. The oldest known example of a Corinthian column is in the Temple of Apollo Epicurius at Bassae in Arcadia, c. 450-420 BC, but the order was used sparingly in Greece before the Roman period. The Romans elaborated the order with the ends of the leaves curled, and it was their favourite order for grand buildings, with their own invention of the Composite, which was first seen in the epoch of Augustus. Acanthus decoration continued in popularity in Byzantine, Romanesque, and Gothic architecture. It saw a major revival in the Renaissance, and still is used today. The Roman writer Vitruvius (c. 75 – c. 15 BC) related that the Corinthian order had been invented by Callimachus, a Greek architect and sculptor who was inspired by the sight of a votive basket that had been left on the grave of a young girl. A few of her toys were in it, and a square tile had been placed over the basket, to protect them from the weather. An acanthus plant had grown through the woven basket, mixing its spiny, deeply cut leaves with the weave of the basket. =Byzantine= Some of the most detailed and elaborate acanthus decoration occurs in important buildings of the Byzantine architectural tradition, where the leaves are undercut, drilled, and spread over a wide surface. Use of the motif continued in Medieval art, particularly in sculpture and wood carving and in friezes, although usually it is stylized and generalized, so that one doubts that the artists connected it with any plant in particular. After centuries without decorated capitals, they were revived enthusiastically in Romanesque architecture, often using foliage designs, including acanthus. Curling acanthus-type leaves occur frequently in the borders and ornamented initial letters of illuminated manuscripts, and are commonly found in combination with palmettes in woven silk textiles. In the Renaissance classical models were followed very closely, and the acanthus becomes clearly recognisable again in large-scale architectural examples.

His films often explore themes of life and death with metaphysical and science fiction elements. Prominent among them are Jacob’s Ladder, My Life and Ghost, for which he received the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Ghost was also nominated for Best Picture, and was the highest-grossing film of 1990. Early life Born to a Jewish family and raised in Detroit, Michigan, Rubin is a 1960 graduate of Detroit's Mumford High School. His love of theater began at the age of five when he saw his mother acting in Mary Poppins at a local high school. He later became an actor and director in high school plays. Bruce traces his interest in filmmaking to viewing the Ingmar Bergman film Wild Strawberries at the Krim Theater in Detroit when he was a teenager. He attended Detroit's Wayne State University for two years, then transferred to NYU film school in 1962. Bruce only took one screenwriting course at NYU and almost failed it, due in part to what he considered the confusing, non-intuitive theories on plotting and structure. His classmates at NYU included Martin Scorsese and Brian De Palma, who became the director of Jennifer, Bruce's first student script. While still at NYU, Bruce got a job selling hot dogs and beer at the 1964 New York World’s Fair. Every day he spent his lunch break at the Johnson's Wax Pavilion watching a 20-minute movie, To Be Alive! by Francis Thompson, about the commonalities of growing up in cultures across the U.S., Europe, Africa and Asia. It was viewed on three separate 18-foot screens, and a single-screen version won the Oscar for documentary (short subject). At the end, the narrator states, “Simply to be alive is a great joy.” This inspired Bruce, who said he “wanted to bring that feeling into the world somehow—that it’s wonderful to be alive.” Career In 1966, Bruce became an assistant film editor at NBC’s evening news show, The Huntley-Brinkley Report, but an LSD experience inspired his departure on a spiritual quest a year later. He meditated in Greece and then headed for Tibet, hitchhiking through Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan, where he “felt embraced and expanded by each culture.” He lived in ashrams in India, a Tibetan monastery in Kathmandu, a Buddhist temple in Bangkok and a Sikh temple in Singapore. He spent a month in Japan, and a week sleeping amidst excavations in the temples at Angkor Wat. But it wasn't until Bruce returned to New York City that he met his spiritual teacher, Rudi, only a few blocks away from where he began his journey. And once again, he tried to establish a film career. David Bienstock, an independent filmmaker who was Curator of Film at the Whitney Museum in New York, was a friend of Bruce's and hired him as an assistant. Bruce later became Assistant Curator of Film and helped establish The New American Filmmakers Series, a launching pad for independent filmmakers and a precursor to Sundance. Bruce and David also began writing a science fiction screenplay, Quasar. Bruce recalled, “We came up with a story about an astronomer who discovers what he thinks is a giant quasar, but it turns out to be something that spiritually changes his life. That was the breakthrough. My spiritual life and my creative life merged. It all became one journey, one unfolding.” The script was later optioned by Ingo Preminger, producer of the Oscar-winning movie MASH, but when Richard Zanuck, President of Warner Brothers, said he didn't understand the ending, the option expired. Zanuck would later produce Bruce's film, Deep Impact. The passing of David Bienstock and Rudi in the same year was a catalyst for Bruce and his family's move to Indiana in 1974, to be near another student of Rudi's. Over the next six years, Bruce's wife Blanche would earn her Doctorate at Indiana University while Bruce earned his Masters, taught meditation and took a string of odd jobs while trying to write. They moved to DeKalb, Illinois in 1980 when Blanche was hired as a professor at Northern Illinois University. While there, Bruce began writing Jacob’s Ladder and the treatment for Ghost, and waited to hear about a script he'd started in New York and sold in 1979, The George Dunlap Tape. The director of Bruce's George Dunlap Tape script, Doug Trumbull (2001: A Space Odyssey, Close Encounters, Blade Runner) brought in other writers and the film opened in 1983 as Brainstorm, starring Christopher Walken and Natalie Wood, in her last film. Bruce borrowed money from a producer to travel to the LA premiere of Brainstorm. While there, Bruce and his wife talked with his former NYU classmate, Brian De Palma, who Bruce credits with his move to LA. “[Brian] said, ‘Bruce, if you want a career in Hollywood you have to move here.’ I had heard that a thousand times and never wanted to believe it because of the terror of moving to Hollywood and not having anybody answer your phone calls. But my wife took it to heart, and when we arrived back in Illinois she quit her job, put our house on the market and said we're doing it. It was the most courageous act I've ever experienced.” Two weeks before Bruce and his family were leaving for LA, they sold their home. On the same day, Bruce also got a call from his LA agent, dropping Bruce as a client because his work was “too metaphysical and nobody wanted to make movies about ghosts.” Bruce was discouraged but his wife was not. “So we ended up moving to Hollywood with no money… and within a week I had a house and an agent. I had a writing job. I was very lucky.” Bruce's screenwriting career was assisted by a December 1983 American Film magazine (AFI) article written by Stephen Rebello titled, One in a Million, listing ten of the best unproduced scripts in Hollywood, scripts that he said “were just too good to get produced.” Rebello had read 125 scripts recommended by respected industry connections. The final ten screenplays included The Princess Bride, Total Recall, At Close Range and Jacob’s Ladder. Rebello wrote in part: “Admirers of Bruce Joel Rubin’s Jacob’s Ladder flat out refuse to describe this screenplay. Their only entreaty? ‘Read it. It’s extraordinary.’ And it is... page for page, it is one of the very few screenplays I've read with the power to consistently raise hackles in broad daylight.” About Jacob’s Ladder, Bruce wrote: “The script idea for Jacob’s Ladder began as a dream: A subway late at night; I am traveling through the bowels of New York City. There are very few people on the train. A terrible loneliness grips me. The train pulls into the station and I get off. The platform is deserted. I walk to the nearest exit, and discover the gate is locked. A feeling of terrible despair begins to pulse through me as I hike to the other end of the platform. To my horror, that exit is chained, too. I am totally trapped and overwhelmed by a sense of doom. I know with perfect certainty that I will never see daylight again. My only hope is to jump onto the tracks and enter the tunnel, the darkness. The only direction from there is down. I know the next stop on my journey is hell. Partly that came out of my own fear and despair, because nothing in my life seemed to be working. In Illinois, I felt like my story had evaporated completely. My story was, ‘You don’t have a story.’ Here you are, living in a cornfield. No friends. No work. Your wife is supporting the family. Basically, in my mind, the story was over. I could have given up my filmmaking goals and settled into a different kind of lifestyle... My story would have been: ‘Okay, you tried.’ Instead, I woke up from my subway dream and said, ‘That’s a great opening for a movie.’ I then tried to write my way out of hell...” In the next 30 years, in Los Angeles and later in New York, Bruce would write more than 30 scripts and get 11 produced, while continuing his meditation practice and teaching weekly meditation classes. Bruce has stated, “Each film was an attempt, successful or not, to witness and explore the unseen world of our lives. I wanted to speak to adults and to children and to touch the inner mystery of our shared being.” Bruce wrote the book and lyrics for Ghost the Musical (the musical adaptation of Ghost) which premiered in the United Kingdom in March 2011 and opened on Broadway in Spring 2012. Sometimes credited as \\"Derek Saunders\\" or simply \\"Bruce Rubin.\\" The film My Life was his directorial debut. Recently, Bruce's creative focus has turned to photography. \\"The result of always carrying an iPhone in his pocket, he describes this new phase in his creative life as the discovery of seeing. As Bruce explains, 'The mystery and magic of the world is not hidden. It is under our feet, on old walls, in rusting garbage cans. The beauty, the wonder, never ends.' Although Bruce’s film career has been entwined with the imagery of cinema, his primary focus has always been on narrative storytelling more than the visual. In recent years, he has shifted his focus to the image itself and has discovered that photographs, even in abstraction, have wonderful stories to tell.” Personal life Bruce and his wife, Blanche, split their time between Los Angeles and San Francisco, where he taught weekly meditation classes. He currently offers these classes weekly in Dutchess County, New York. Blanche is an artist with a Doctorate in Art Education. She taught at Indiana University, Northern Illinois University, California State University at Northridge, and was the Program Evaluator at the J. Paul Getty Institute for Education in the Arts, where she helped create a national program still used in schools today. Their younger son Ari, a pilot, screenwriter and former board member of the WGA, is now in law school. Their son Joshua has worked as an award-winning writer of major video games like Assassin’s Creed 2 and Destiny. He is now involved in the development of virtual reality projects and works as an Interactive Narrative Consultant with clients in the U.S. and Europe.

While the meeting's original purpose was to provide a gift for Arthur Griffith for defending Maud Gonne from an accusation that she was a British spy,Trotter 2001, p.82 it turned to planning a \\"Patriotic Children's Treat\\" in response to the Children's Treat in the Phoenix Park which had been part of Queen Victoria's April visit to Dublin. One aim of the royal visit was to encourage Irishmen to enlist in the British Army to fight in the Boer War, whereas Griffith, Gonne and others were sympathetic to the Boers. Over fifty women joined the organising committee for the Patriotic Children's Treat, which took place in July on the Sunday after the Wolfe Tone Commemoration. It involved 30,000 children parading from Beresford Place to Clonturk Park, followed by a picnic and anti-recruitment speeches.Trotter 2001, pp.82–85 The funds left over after the Patriotic Children's Treat were used to establish Inghinidhe na hÉireann as a permanent organisation.Trotter 2001, p.85 Members Most founders were middle-class Catholics, though Helena Molony wrote in its magazine, Bean na hÉireann, \\"Now there were some young girls in Dublin, chiefly members of the Irish classes of Celtic Literary Society… They were (with one exception) all working girls.They had not much gold and silver to give to Ireland. Only willing hearts, earnestness and determination.\\" They originally met on Easter Sunday after noon Mass, she wrote, with the intention of presenting an inscribed blackthorn stick to (an unnamed) Arthur Griffith, who had thrashed a newspaper editor for maligning Maud Gonne. They went on to plan a picnic for 30,000 children as an alternative to the planned celebrations of a recruiting visit of the British monarch to Ireland. As they had no money, they raised subscriptions all over Dublin, coming together in an association named Daughters of Ireland, or (in deliberately antiquated spelling) Inghinidhe na h-Éireann.Bean na hÉireann article, Inghinidhe na hÉireann, The Story of the First Meeting, 1901, held in National Library of Ireland, call number IR3996 B15 Maud Gonne was elected President of the association; Vice-Presidents were Alice Furlong, Jenny Wyse Power, Annie Egan, and Anna Johnston (Ethna Carbery). Among the founders were Helena Molony, Sinéad O'Flanagan (later wife of Éamon de Valera), actors Maire Quinn and Molly and Sara Allgood, physician Kathleen Lynn and Mary Macken, a leading member of the Catholic Women's Suffrage League.

Women and Irish Nationalism\\". Attic Press, Cork, 2001. p.20 * To encourage the study of Gaelic, of Irish literature, history, music and art, especially among the young, by the organising and teaching of classes for the above subjects. * To support and popularise Irish manufactures. * To discourage the reading and circulation of low English literature, the singing of English songs, the attending of vulgar English entertainments at theatres and music halls, and to combat in every way English influence, which is doing so much injury to the artistic taste and refinement of the Irish people. * To form a fund called the National Purposes Fund for the furtherance of the above objects. They sponsored classes and entertainment for children and adults, and protested at the British army recruitment centre in O'Connell Street.Trotter 2001, pp.87–88 The Inghinidhe performed tableaux vivants on themes from Irish mythology and world history.Trotter 2001, pp.88–91 It also produced Irish plays with male actors recruited from other nationalist groups.Trotter 2001, pp.91–93 In 1908, the Inghinidhe launched a monthly magazine, Bean na hÉireann, which was edited by Helena Molony. Among the contributors were PH Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh, Sidney Gifford (under her nom de plume John Brennan), Maud Gonne, Constance Markievicz, who wrote the gardening column and Molony herself who wrote the Labour Notes. There were articles on politics, the vote for women, nationalism, language – and regular columns on labour issues, fashion (stressing Irish-made clothes), gardening, articles in Irish in the cló Ghaelach (as Irish was always then written and printed), a children's section with competitions, etc. It was popular with both men and women. Superseding In 1914, Inghinidhe na hÉireann was absorbed into Cumann na mBan, the women's arm of the Irish Volunteers.

The provision of legal advice will often involve analyzing a set of facts and advising a person to take a specific course of action based on the applicable law. Legal advice is ordinarily provided in exchange for financial or other tangible compensation. Advice given without remuneration is normally referred to as being pro bono publico (in the public good), or simply pro bono. In the common law systems it is usually received from a solicitor, barrister or lawyer; in civil law systems it is given by advocates, lawyers or other professionals (such as tax experts, professional advisors, atc.). In some countries, legal advice is subject to the possession of a specific licence; in others, it is simply subject to the general regulation of professional obligation and can be provided by any person, who will usually be legally responsible for the provided advice. The UK's Legal Services Act 2007 includes the giving of legal advice within the definition of unreserved legal activities, which means that it can be provided by any person not just an officer of the court. However, if it is provided by a lawyer or another person authorised by one of the front line legal services regulators, then this activity is included within their regulatory reach. With the advent of the internet, many services have been established to provide individuals the power to conduct their own legal research or prepare their own legal documents. As well, some companies offer answers to legal questions directly through their web services. Legal information Legal advice is distinguished from legal information which is the reiteration of legal fact. Legal information can be conveyed by a parking meter, sign or by other forms of notice such as a warning by a law enforcement officer. Printed legal materials, such as directions and how-to manuals, are generally not considered legal advice. Accordingly, instructions on how to meet court requirements for the submission of forms and other court documents do not constitute legal advice. Thus, a non-lawyer may sell legal forms, provide general instructions for filling out the forms, and provide typing services for the entry of information into forms, provided no legal advice is given. Basic instruction on how to complete a legal form, where to place information on the form, and the definition of legal terms used on a form constitute the provision of legal information. Instructing a person on how to phrase information in a legal document or form, or advising the person as to what he or she should say in court, is the provision of legal advice. Similarly, application of legal rules and principles to a specific set of facts and advising a course of conduct is almost always held to constitute legal advice.

Discussing facts and information is considered a fundamental free speech right and is not considered medical advice. Medical advice can also be distinguished from personal advice, even if the advice concerns medical care.  Doctor–patient relationship  Medical advice is given in the context of a doctor–patient relationship. A licensed health care professional can be held legally liable for the advice he or she gives to a patient. Giving bad advice may be considered medical malpractice under specified circumstances. The doctor–patient relationship is one factor in determining the patient's compliance with medical advice. Patients adhere more closely to medical advice when the healthcare provider is friendly, doesn't interrupt the patient, or has good verbal communication skills. Patients are less likely to comply with medical advice if the advice is not what the patients expected, if the patients do not agree with the proposed treatment, if the patient is not confident in the provider's competence, or if the patient cannot understand what the provider says due to language barriers or overuse of medical jargon. Patients are also less likely to comply with medical advice if the healthcare provider seems disrespectful of the patient or appears to hold negative stereotypes of the patients' race, class, or other characteristics.

Basse dedicated Polyhymnia to Bridget, Countess of Lindsey, second wife of Montagu Bertie, 2nd Earl of Lindsey, and the opening poem in the volume is addressed to the Countess's grandfather, Francis Norris, 1st Earl of Berkshire: In playne (my honour'd Lord) I was not borne Audacious vowes or forraigne legs to use; Nature denyed my outside to adorne, And I of art to learne outsides refuse. Yet haveing of them both enough to scorne Silence and vulgar prayse, this humble Muse And her meane favourite at your command Chose in this kinde to kisse your noble hand. Career Basse was educated at Lord Williams's School. The long interval of fifty-one years between the production of the first and last poems bearing Basse's signature led John Payne Collier to conjecture that there were two poets of the same name, and he attributed to an elder William Basse the works published in 1602, and to a younger William Basse all those published later. The internal evidence offered by the poems fails, however, to support this conclusion. \\"Urania\\", the last poem of the collection, bearing the date 1653, has all the metrical characteristics of the \\"Sword and Buckler\\" of 1602; and Bathurst's verses prove that Basse followed his poetical career through many generations. A William Basse 'of Suffolk' entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, as a sizar in 1629, and took the degree of B.A. in 1632, and that of M.A. in 1636, but it is highly improbable that this student was the poet. There was a family named Basse, of Benhall, Suffolk, in the seventeenth century, of whom a William died in 1607, aged 85, and left a son Thomas and a grandson William, probably the Cambridge student; but it is impossible to identify the poet with any member of this family. The fact that his 'Great Brittaines Sunnesset' was published at Oxford, and his intimate relations with two great Oxfordshire houses, seem to connect the poet with Oxfordshire rather than with Suffolk.

The one was entitled \\"Sword and Buckler, or Serving Man's Defence\\"; the other \\"Three Pastoral Elegies of Anander, Anetor, and Muridella\\". Of the former, which the author describes as his first production, a unique perfect copy is in the Bodleian Library; it was reprinted in J. P. Collier's Illustrations of Early English Popular Literature, vol. ii., in 1864. The only copy known of the latter is in Winchester College library. In 1613 an elegy on Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, called \\"Great Brittaines; Sunnes-set, bewailed with a Shower of Teares, by William Basse\\", was issued by Joseph Barnes at Oxford. It was dedicated by the author \\"to his honourable master, Sir Richard Wenman, knight\\", and was reproduced at Oxford by W. H. Allnutt from the perfect copy at the Bodleian in 1872. No other volume of Basse's poems was printed in his lifetime, but two manuscript collections, prepared for the press, are still extant. Of these, one bears the title of Polyhymnia, and has never been printed. The only copy of it was known to belong to Richard Heber, and afterward to Thomas Corser; on the fly-leaf is the autograph of Francis, Lord Norreys, to whom the opening verses are addressed, and to whose sister, Bridget, Countess of Lindsey, the collection is dedicated. Another manuscript of Polyhymnia, described by Cole in his manuscript 'Athenæ Cantab.' and now lost, differed materially from the Corser manuscript. The second collection left by Basse in manuscript consists of three long pastoral poems, of which the first is dedicated to Sir Richard Wenman; bears the date 1653, and was printed for the first time in J. P. Collier's Miscellaneous Tracts, in 1872. To it is prefixed a poem addressed to Basse, by Ralph (afterwards dean) Bathurst, who compares the author to an \\"aged oak\\", and says: > ... thy grey muse grew up with older times, > And our deceased grandsires lisp'd the rhymes. Bathurst's verses were printed in Warton's pleasant 'Life of Bathurst' (1761), p. 288, with the inscription 'To Mr. W. Basse upon the intended publication of his poems, 13 January 1651.'. Basse's most famous poem is his \\"enormously popular sixteen-line elegy on Shakespeare\\": > [It was] written between 1616 (when Shakespeare died) and 1623 (when Jonson > responded to Basse in his own tribute to Shakespeare in the First Folio). > Wells and Taylor. list twenty-seven different seventeenth-century manuscript > versions of the poem, ten of which attribute it to Basse, including one > (British Library, Lansdowne MS 777, fol. 67v) in the handwriting of Basse's > friend William Browne.Lee states that these lines are signed 'Wm. Basse.'; ; > however Kathman states that the handwriting is that of William Browne. It > first reached print in the 1633 edition of John Donne's poems, but was > dropped from the 1635 edition, and was next printed in the 1640 edition of > Shakespeare's poems, with a correct attribution to 'W. B.' and the title 'On > the Death of William Shakespeare, who Died in Aprill, Anno. Dom. 1616' (sig. > K8v). The same year it was also printed anonymously in Wits Recreation. Basse also wrote a commendatory poem for Michael Baret's Hipponomie, or the Vineyard of Horsemanship (1618), and he has been identified with the 'W. B.' who contributed verses to Phillip Massinger's Bondman (1624), although William Browne has also been claimed as their author. In Izaak Walton's Compleat Angler the character Piscator, representing Walton, remarks, \\"I'll promise you I'll sing a song that was lately made at my request by Mr. William Basse, one that hath made the choice songs of the 'Hunter in his Career' and of 'Tom of Bedlam', and many others of note; and this that I will sing is in praise of Angling.\\" Basse's \\"Angler's Song\\", beginning \\"As inward love breeds outward talk\\", then follows. Piscator's friend Coridon says \\"we are all beholding to the good man that made this song\\" and proposes a toast to the poet. Of the other two songs mentioned by Walton, a unique copy of \\"Maister Basse, his careere, or the new hunting. To a new Court tune\\", is in the Pepys collection at Cambridge; it is reprinted in 'Wit and Drollery' (1682), p. 64, and in Old Ballads (1725), ii. 196. The tune is given in the Skene MS. preserved in the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh, and a ballad in the Bagford collection in the British Museum, entitled \\"Hubert's Ghost\\", is written \\"to the tune of Basse's Career\\". Basse's second ballad, \\"Tom of Bedlam\\", has been identified by Sir Harris Nicolas in his edition of Walton's Angler, with a song of the same name in Percy's Reliques, ii. 357; but many other ballads bear the same title, and this identification is therefore doubtful. In 1636 Basse contributed a poem to the 'Annalia Dubrensia.'.

Under Cutcliffe, in 2012 the Blue Devils ended an 18-year bowl drought and also brought the Victory Bell back to Duke after beating arch-rival University of North Carolina in 2012. The following season, 2013, Cutcliffe led the team to a second straight bowl appearance, another win over North Carolina, an Atlantic Coast Conference Coastal Division championship and the first 10-win season in school history. He also earned multiple college football coach of the year awards from the Walter Camp Football Foundation, the Maxwell Football Club, and the Bobby Dodd Foundation. Early life Cutcliffe was born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama, which played a formative role in his development as a football coach. He has two brothers (Charles \\"Paige\\" Cutcliffe, and Raymond Eugene \\"JR.\\" Cutcliffe) and three sisters (Mary Marlyn Cutcliffe Sullivan, Margart Lynn Cutcliffe, and Elizabeth \\"Buff\\" Cutcliffe Easterly). Cutcliffe attended Banks High School in Birmingham where he played football. He attended the University of Alabama, where he worked as an assistant director of the athletic dormitory. Coaching career =Early coaching career= In 1976, Cutcliffe took a job at Banks High School where he served as an assistant and later as the head coach. In 1982, he was hired as a part-time coach at the University of Tennessee. A year later, he was promoted to full-time status as the tight ends and assistant offensive line coach. By 1990, Cutcliffe was promoted to quarterbacks coach. He became offensive coordinator as well in 1993. As coordinator, Cutcliffe helped lead the Vols to two Southeastern Conference championships and a national championship. He also helped groom Heath Shuler and future Super Bowl MVP Peyton Manning, serving as their position coach. =Ole Miss= On December 2, 1998, Cutcliffe was hired as the head football coach at Ole Miss. Cutcliffe had success at Ole Miss, where he recruited Eli Manning, son of Ole Miss player Archie Manning, to play quarterback. In 2003, Cutcliffe's Rebels tied LSU for the Southeastern Conference West Division title, and they won the Cotton Bowl Classic. The bowl victory capped off the Rebels' first 10-win season in 32 years, and only their second since the Johnny Vaught era. Cutcliffe was fired by Ole Miss Athletic Director Pete Boone in December 2004 after his only losing season at Ole Miss. Boone had asked Cutcliffe to fire some assistant coaches and provide a detailed plan for improving the program, specifically the defense and recruiting. Cutcliffe refused to fire any staff members, and was subsequently fired along with his assistants. =Post-Ole Miss= After his stint at Ole Miss, Cutcliffe was hired by head coach Charlie Weis as the assistant head coach and quarterbacks coach at Notre Dame, but health problems forced him to resign before his first season there. In 2005, he underwent successful triple-bypass surgery to correct a 99-percent blocked artery. After taking a year off he returned to Knoxville to coach Tennessee again and join his sons, Chris Cutcliffe and Marcus Hilliard, then Tennessee students, on campus (his oldest daughter, Katie Cutcliffe Kolls, would also attend Tennessee). After Cutcliffe's successor as offensive coordinator at Tennessee, Randy Sanders, resigned, Phillip Fulmer rehired Cutcliffe to replace him. Cutcliffe led a major turnaround of the Tennessee offense during the 2006 season. Tennessee quarterback Erik Ainge ranked among the nation's top 25 passers by yardage, and wide receiver Robert Meachem had the third-most receiving yards of any player. =Duke University= Cutcliffe meeting with players, 2012 Cutcliffe was hired as the head football coach at Duke University on December 14, 2007, replacing Ted Roof, who had amassed a 4–42 win-loss record (1–31 in the ACC) over four years at the school. Cutcliffe inherited a program that had tallied only three winning seasons in the last 25 years and, before the 2008 season, had not beaten an ACC opponent in over three seasons. Cutcliffe immediately began a strength and conditioning program, challenging the team to collectively lose 1,000 pounds after finding the team in less than ideal physical shape. On Saturday, August 30, 2008, Cutcliffe won his first game as Duke's head coach, defeating the James Madison Dukes 31–7, before a crowd of 32,571, the largest in Wallace Wade Stadium since 1994. The game marked the introduction of a number of rituals that Cutcliffe hopes to turn into Duke traditions, including the Blue Devil Walk, which parades the players and coaching staff from Duke Chapel, through West Campus and past Cameron Indoor Stadium to Wallace Wade Stadium, and the \\"Blue Devil Rock\\", located in the stadium tunnel and mined from the same quarry used in the construction of Duke's West Campus. In Cutcliffe's second game, Duke lost to Northwestern in a mirror image game of the previous season's matchup, twice falling short of a touchdown deep in Northwestern territory. After the home loss against Northwestern, Duke hosted Navy, prevailing 41–31. Cutcliffe next led Duke to its first ACC victory since 2004, with a 31–3 rout of Virginia. This was a complete turnaround from the team's 2006 game against UVA, in which the Blue Devils were shut out 37–0 in Wallace Wade. Duke proceeded to lose to Georgia Tech and Miami before notching its first road win of the season, a 10–7 victory over SEC opponent Vanderbilt. Next, on the road at Wake Forest, Duke lost in overtime, 33–30, missing what would have been a game-winning field goal at the end of regulation. This was another in a string of such painful kicking miscues for the Blue Devils, including a miss at North Carolina in the previous season. The next game, Duke went on to lose to Clemson, 31–7, before fighting to a surprisingly close 14–3 loss to powerhouse Virginia Tech and suffering a disappointing close loss to arch-rival North Carolina at season's end. In January 2010, following Lane Kiffin's abrupt departure after just one season at the helm of the Tennessee football team, Cutcliffe quickly emerged as a leading candidate to replace Kiffin. Cutcliffe, however, ultimately rebuffed Tennessee's overtures, remaining at Duke and stating, “After much thought and consideration, Karen and I reached the decision that Duke is the place for our family. We have both family members and lifetime friends in the Knoxville community and share a deep respect for the University of Tennessee. Our ties to the school and the Eastern Tennessee area are obvious. But before Tennessee’s hiring process comes to a conclusion, I know that Duke University is where we want to coach.” Cutcliffe's decision was widely lauded as a rare example of commitment and integrity among prominent college football coaches. On October 20, 2012, Coach Cutcliffe led the Devils to their first win over North Carolina since 2003. In doing so, Duke became bowl eligible for the first time since 1994. He was subsequently named ACC Coach of the Year on November 27, 2012. On October 26, 2013, Cutcliffe led the Blue Devils to an upset of #14 Virginia Tech, 13–10. This was Duke's first win over a ranked opponent since beating #14 Virginia in 1994. With this win, the Blue Devils became bowl eligible for a second consecutive season for the first time since the 1988 and 1989 seasons. On November 29, with a close 27–25 win over North Carolina, the Blue Devils clinched their first-ever Coastal Division title and a berth in the 2013 ACC Championship Game falling to the eventual National Champions Florida State Seminoles and Heisman Trophy winner Jameis Winston 45-7. Duke also had its first 10-win season in the school's over 100-year history of football. Duke's historic 2013 season concluded on New Year's Eve in Atlanta, GA, at the Chick- fil-A Bowl against the Texas A&M; Aggies, led by 2012 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel. In a high-scoring affair totaling 100 points, Duke took a 38–17 halftime lead before ultimately succumbing to a Manziel-led rally, 52–48. During the 2015 season, Duke, ranked 22nd at the time, was ahead of Miami until the end when the Hurricanes threw multiple latterals and won the game as the time ran out. David Cutcliffe was speechless on the sidelines and just stood there chewing his gum. In a press conference after the game he was critical of the officiating and the ACC referees later admitted they made the wrong call. Cutcliffe is already third on Duke's all-time wins list, behind only Hall of Famers Wallace Wade and Bill Murray. =Quarterback coaching= Eight quarterbacks whom Cutcliffe coached in college have gone on to play in the NFL: Heath Shuler, Peyton Manning, Tee Martin, Eli Manning, Erik Ainge, Thaddeus Lewis, Sean Renfree, and Daniel Jones. Cutcliffe also coached former Colorado Rockies first baseman Todd Helton while Helton played quarterback at Tennessee. Eli Manning's former backup, Seth Smith, is a retired professional baseball player. Family Cutcliffe is married to Karen Cutcliffe. They have four children: Marcus, Chris, Katie, and Emily.

Tim Priest, is a former New South Wales Police Detective Sergeant in Australia. He served in the Sydney suburb of Cabramatta and led a police revolt against his commanders for failing to say action in movies about gang crime and heroin dealing in South West Sydney. Prime Minister John Howard announced that Tim Priest would be the new Chairman of the Prime Minister's Crime Advisory Board and advise the Coalition Federal Government on Crime Prevention initiatives. He wrote a book called To Protect And To Serve with Richard Basham about his experiences dealing with the drug trade and the police service.Priest, T. & Basham, R. 2003. To Protect and To Serve : the untold truth about the New South Wales Police Service. New Holland, Sydney. In 2002 he gave evidence to an enquiry into the crime- and drugs ridden suburb of Cabramatta and attracted national and international headlines. His testimony led to the resignations or sackings of the State's Police Minister, Education Minister, Police Commissioner and Deputy and Assistant Commissioners. Major changes were made to the NSW police force and the way that police handle gangs and drugs in Sydney. The Cabramatta Parliamentary Enquiry's final report (2002) recommended that the Government adopt some of the initiatives that Priest had offered as a means to solving the crisis in Cabramatta. Ultimately the NSW Government adopted the recommendations and the NSW Police implemented them in 2002. In 2003, he gave a talk at a Quadrant dinner in November 2003 titled \\"The Rise of Middle Eastern Crime in Australia\\" in which he also talked about his experiences policing specific households of people of Lebanese descent, and criticised police commissioner Peter Ryan and journalist Mike Carlton. However, in 2006 The Sydney Morning Herald, said of Priest's talk: \\"It has become a celebrated story, told by the whistleblowing former policeman Tim Priest. The trouble is, it isn't true. ... Priest was compressing good detail to make a point, and saw nothing wrong with that... Priest observed \\"All it did was open the debate because for whatever reason there are a number of people in academia and in the government that did not want to talk about Middle eastern crime\\". In the same speech he warned of the consequences of ignoring \\"middle eastern\\" crime and pointed to the Sydney suburb of Cronulla as a likely trouble spot involving \\"mid eastern\\" gangs. In 2005 the Cronulla riots erupted over a 48-hour period across Sydney as caucasians went on a violent rampage, attacking youths thought to be of Middle East descent and police, in retaliation over an earlier incident at Cronulla Beach. He endured a long campaign of hateful media articles engineered by former police officers whom Priest had exposed as either corrupt or incompetent, and ill informed media personnel. Priest eventually sued The Sydney Morning Herald (twice), Author Chris Masters and publisher Allan and Unwin over various publications. All matters were reportedly settled out of Court. He has written a number of best selling books since 2003 including Enemies of the State and On Deadly Ground- the John Newman Assassination. His most recent book \\"Cops and Crooks\\" entails unfortunate stories of criminals humorously caught on the wrong side of the law. Priest continues to speak on crime prevention strategies and often asked to give an opinion of current issues on multiple media platforms, particularly his opinion editorials in various news papers. He is survived by his wife and four children.

Ha Ja Ba Ra La is considered one of the best nonsense stories of Bengali literature. To highlight its genre, artistic merit and style, it is frequently compared to Alice In Wonderland. Plot The story starts with a child, the narrator, suddenly waking up from sleep and finding that the handkerchief they had placed just beside them before sleeping has turned into a cat. They start talking to the cat, who speaks nonsensically about a handkerchief and a semicolon before disappearing over the hedge. The cat tells him to go find Kakeshwar, in a series of calculations that eventually tell him that he is in a tree. The child finds Kakeshwar doing mathematical calculations on a slate, that appears very unusual to the narrator. This includes division that is purely illogical and fallacious. After arguing over math, a goat appears and narrates his life about eating paper and other artificial things. Hijibijbij appears and laughs hysterically at improbable situations and keeps changing his mind about the names of his family members. Then many animals appear, and confusion results. The child wakes up from their odd dream and finds the cat, which does not talk. Characters Most of the characters have found idiomatic usage in Bengali language, which is true for many of Ray's works. Some of the main characters are: ;Shree Kakkeshwar kuchkuche (): A raven/crow who wears a clerk's green eyeshade while performing mathematics. ;Gechhodada (): A character that is only alluded to by the cat but never appears in the story. he is completely unpredictable, and according to the cat, can only be found solving a very complicated, irrational and nonsensical mathematics, which depends on many probabilities about where Gechodada can be that moment. ;Heejibeejbeej ():A person who imagines very improbable situations and laughs at them. ;Sheyal : The fox and the advocate against Kumir ;Byakaran Shing BA Khadyabisharad ():A goat who delivers academic lectures on non-academic subjects, such as what goats do not eat. ;Pyancha : The owl judge in the court ;Udhho and Budhho (): dwarf-like creatures who are fighting one moment and hugging the next. The phrase \\"Udhor pindi Budhor ghare\\", meaning (but not literally translated to) \\"the shoe is on the other foot\\", has become a very common idiom. ;Shojaru : A porcupine who makes a court case for insult ;Kumir : A crocodile, the advocate of Shojaru ;Beraal: A nonsense cat who speaks about nonsense things like gechodada (grandpa tree) and other people. ;Nera (): A person who has no hair. He loves to sing nonsense songs. ;Gechhoboudi : Who dos not appear in the story but is the wife of gechhodada who cooks ;Mejomama : Maternal uncle who finds everything about the story nonsense.

Publication history Comet Man was the subject of a limited series in 1987, created by Bill Mumy, Miguel Ferrer, and Kelley Jones.Bill Mumy interviews on Outsight Radio Hours Comet Man first appeared in Comet Man #1 (February 1987), and appeared in the rest of the series from Comet Man #2-6 (March–July 1987). Fictional character biography =Early life= Dr. Stephen Beckley was the son of Jack Beckley of the United States Air Force. Stephen's parents did not take too well to the news he was leaving for the South Pacific as a Naval pilot. Jack did not know his fiancée was carrying his child. She was moved to Florida, where the child, John, was put up for adoption. Upon his return as a war hero, Jack married; he fathered two more children. Stephen and Rosemary. John grew up to found top secret intelligence agency known as the Bridge. John held the title of 'The Superior'. When his own dad tells him that he has one son, he becomes enraged and arranges an accident that kills him. Stephen Beckley had become an astronomer and astrophysicist. He has a son Benny, by way of Ann. They run the Edmon project, which investigates astronomical incidents. Stephen pilots a craft through a tail of a comet and meets Max, a being from the so-called Colony Fortisque. Max claims his race is responsible for starting evolution on Earth and other planets in the Milky Way Galaxy. =Origin= However, Max had accidentally vaporized Beckley when they meet. He uses his technology to recreate Beckley, which grants him various superpowers. Upon return to Earth, Beckley is taken prisoner by David Hilbert, an old friend and secret 'Bridge' operative. He undergoes various tests. Beckley's wife continues to believe he is dead. Beckley escapes; his wife, also a prisoner, dies in a separate attempt. Benny survives and a Dr. Fishler puts him under tests to try and duplicate Stephen's new powers. Beckley makes an ally in Reed Richards, who gives him a device to allow him to teleport easier. He learns his wife is dead; S.H.I.E.L.D. tells him of his brother. He finds his son, injured and saves his life. This grants him a copy of Beckley's powers. Stephen seemingly dies. Benny is enraged by the sequence of events he has seen. He kills Fishler and falls into a catatonic state. Hilbert, now repentant, vows to take care of Benny. 'Bridge' assassins attempt to claim Max and his ship. Max's pacifist tendencies evaporate and he erupts into violence. The men flee and Max decides to destroy Earth to neutralize their violent ways. Beckley calmed Max down and agreed to accompany him on a visit to the Fortisquian colony. 'The Superior' almost kills Max and Stephen but they escape to the colony unscathed. Stephen gains more control over his powers on Max's home world. Both return to Earth. Stephen finds his sister and son living with John. Comet Man used his powers to free Benny from his catatonic state. Ultimately, Comet Man learned John was the Superior, who then shot and killed himself.Marvel Comics Presents #53 =The Initiative= Stephen tried to help some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents trying to take down the Superhuman Registration Act violator Cybermancer during the Civil War, but was defeated.Civil War: Front Line Vol. 1 #8 Stephen was considered as a \\"potential recruit\\" for the Initiative program. Powers and abilities Comet Man can teleport himself over vast distances, from Earth to any location in outer space. The limits on Comet Man's teleportation range are as yet unknown. Comet Man's teleportation ability is triggered subconsciously when he is in danger. He can utilize his teleportation power consciously through the use of a \\"psiamplifier\\" device given him by Reed Richards. Comet Man can teleport himself into the presence of another person by concentrating on that person, even if Comet Man does not know where that person is. Apparently Comet Man subconsciously psionically scans the area to which he teleports himself to make sure he does not materialize within a solid object. Comet Man can psionically project a portion of his own consciousness into the mind of another human being or the mind of an animal. In this way Comet Man can read the memories of that other human being or animal and can even influence the thoughts and emotions of that person or animal. Comet Man refers to this power as \\"thought pitching.\\" As a side effect of receiving psionic abilities, Comet Man's capacity for feeling emotions himself has increased. Comet Man possesses superhuman strength, and durability, a regenerative healing factor and telekinesis which he uses to fly, create protective fields, and project destructive blasts.

It is one of only four green sand beaches in the world, the others being Talofofo Beach, Guam; Punta Cormorant on Floreana Island in the Galapagos Islands; and Hornindalsvatnet, Norway. It gets its distinctive coloring from olivine sand eroded out of the enclosing volcanic cone (tuff ring). Characteristics Climbing down to the beach requires a certain level of mobility. The reward is a refreshing swim after a long hike-- when the undertow is minimal. The green sand is more abundant at the bottom of the tuff ring. Papakōlea Beach is located in a bay half circled by Puu Mahana, a tuff ringPers. comm, of Ken Hon, University of Hawaii, Hilo, to J. Encarnacion, Saint Louis University, and J. Encarnacion's personal field notes. formed over 49,000 years ago and associated with the southwest rift of Mauna Loa. Unlike cinder cones, tuff rings consist mostly of volcanic ash produced by violent interactions of magma with groundwater (Diamond Head, on the Island of Oahu, is another example of a tuff ring). Since its last eruption, the tuff ring has partially collapsed and been partially eroded by the ocean. The beach is sometimes named after the tuff ring, and sometimes after the area of land called Papakōlea, which comes from papa kōlea, which means plover flats in the Hawaiian language. Papakōlea is the area near the crater where Pacific golden plovers (Pluvialis fulva) are sometimes seen in winter. The fragmented volcanic material (pyroclastics) of the tuff ring contains olivine, a silicate mineral containing iron and magnesium, also known as peridot when of gem quality. Olivine is a common mineral component of lava and is one of the first crystals to form as magma cools. Olivine is locally known as \\"Hawaiian Diamond\\" and is notably found in Oahu's famous Diamond Head landmark. The source of the green coloration of the beach sands is due to the olivine crystals (whose green color is due to ferrous iron) which are winnowed from the eroding headland by the action of the sea. Olivine, being denser than the enclosing ash matrix, tends to accumulate on the beach whereas the less dense volcanic sand is swept out to sea. Elsewhere on the Big Island, olivine is enclosed in lava rock, rather than volcanic ash, so the olivine is not easily freed from the enclosing rock and tends to weather away rather than accumulate and concentrate as beach sand. right Although these crystals are eventually broken down by weathering and chemical action and washed away, the constant erosion of the tuff ring ensures a steady supply of sand for the foreseeable future. Eventually, however, the supply will run out and the beach will look like any other. The formation of the tuff ring is currently a point of contention, with some arguing that lava flowing into the sea was suddenly cooled, forming an edifice on the coastline (a littoral cone) and others noting that the cone was most likely too far away from the ocean at the time of formation (sea level was much lower during the last Ice Age, when the cone formed) to make such an event possible. Regardless of how it was formed, according to the United States Geological Survey, the last lava flow in the area ended over 10,000 years ago, making the area one of the more stable features in the geologically turbulent Kaū region. As such, the geologic history of the site can be seen in the rock surrounding the beach and bay, which are not subject to erosion and thus display geologic layers formed by previous eruptions, lava flows, and other volcanic events. In addition, the current patterns of erosion can be seen first-hand, as only the portions at the bottom of the tuff ring collapse have been subject to the waves and turned into green sand; the remaining portions appear gray. left center Access Looking east over the many rough path choices on the way to Papakolea Beach The beach is located about east of Ka Lae (known as South Point) on the island of Hawaii. It is surrounded by pasturelands and is only accessible by foot. The paths are rugged (due to both vehicular traffic and erosion) and the land owner, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, has since restricted vehicular traffic in the area. In order to reach the beach one has to climb down the cinder cone.Hiking to the Green Sands Beach from the west across pastureland. The rim of its cinder cone is just left of the photo's center.

It has rough bark on part or all of the trunk, smooth powdery cream to pink bark above, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven and hemispherical or conical fruit.foliage and flowers Coolibah woodland on a floodplain in Northern Australia Sawn heartwood burr of a coolabah tree Description Eucalyptus coolabah is a tree that typically grows to a height of and has hard, fibrous to flaky grey bark with whitish patches on part or all of the trunk and sometimes on the larger branches. The upper bark is smooth and powdery, white to cream-coloured, pale grey or pink and is shed in short ribbons. Young plants and coppice regrowth usually have stems that are more or less square in cross-section, and dull bluish, lance-shaped leaves long and wide. Adult leaves are the same dull green to bluish or greyish on both sides, Lance-shaped to curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on a branching inflorescence in leaf axils with groups of seven buds on each branch. Each branch has a flattened to angular peduncle long, each bud on a cylindrical pedicel long. Mature buds are oval, often glaucous, long and wide with a conical operculum. Flowering has been recorded in most months and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody conical or hemispherical capsule long and wide on a pedicel long with the valves protruding beyond the rim. Eucalyptus coolabah is very similar to E. microtheca which has rough bark to the smallest branches, and to E. victrix which has smooth bark throughout. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus coolabah was first formally described in 1934 by William Blakely and Maxwell Jacobs and the description was published in Blakely's book, A Key to the Eucalypts. The specific epithet (coolabah) and the common name is a loanword from the Indigenous Australian Yuwaaliyaay word, gulabaa.The Macquarie Concise Dictionary, The Macquarie Library, Sydney, 1998, Distribution and habitat Coolibah is found in western New South Wales, central South Australia, the Kimberley region of Western Australia, western Queensland and southern to central parts of the Northern Territory. The tree occurs on occasionally flooded heavy-soiled plains and banks of intermittent streams and creeks that will usually not flow often enough to support the river red gum, E. camaldulensis. Uses The wood typically has a density of . The heartwood is a reddish brown colour and much darker than the sapwood. Indigenous Australians used the wood to make spears, fire-making apparatus, message sticks, coolamons (wooden dishes) and throwing sticks. They would also obtain water from the rootwood.

He was elected probationary fellow of St. John's College, Oxford (1692), proceeded regularly to the degrees of B.A. (1696), M.A. (1699), B.D. (1705), D.D. (1711). He entered holy orders in 1700, and held successively the incumbencies of Kirtlington, St. Giles, Oxford, and Great Stoughton, Huntingdonshire. For a short, time also he was chaplain to his college. He was removed, according to Thomas Hearne, because, in a speech made publicly in the hall of St. John's, he reflected upon William Delaune, the President, and most of the Fellows. The Duchess of Marlborough supported him, and he was reinstated in his office. Evans was presented by his college in 1725 to the rectory of Cheam, Surrey, and died there 18 October 1737. Works Turning on former friends, he published (1710) a poem entitled The Apparition; a dialogue betwixt the Devil and a Doctor concerning the rights of the Christian Church, in which Matthew Tindal and White Kennett were roughly handled.

Name The village is referred to as Ringstead by the Ordnance Survey.Ordnance Survey Landranger map 132, North West Norfolk The longer form of the name is Great Ringstead, which is preferred by the parish council. Historically, this was to distinguish the village from the neighbouring deserted medieval village of Barrett Ringstead, also known as Little Ringstead or Rinstead Parva. This was just to the west,White: History, Gazetteer and Directory of Norfolk 1835 p635 and is now in the parish of Old Hunstanton. Churches The village had two parishes in the Middle Ages, which were consolidated in 1771 and so one church was abandoned.White ibid. p634 The surviving church is dedicated to St Andrew, and has a 13th century tower, 14th century nave and a 15th century chancel. There was a major restoration in 1865, which involved the partial rebuilding of the tower and chancel east wall, as well as the addition of a south aisle and porch. The other church was dedicated to St Peter. Apart from its late 11th century round tower, it was demolished in 1772 but the tower survives in a private garden at the end of Hall Lane, near Ringstead Bury House.Batcock: Ruined and Disused Churches of Norfolk 1991 p52 The lost village of Little Ringstead had a church dedicated to St Andrew, which survives as a roofless ruin in an arable field to the west of Downs Farm. The remains have a rectangular plan, are 13th century and might comprise the chancel of a larger church. The village was depopulated by plague in 1349, but the church continued as a private chapel until it was converted into a barn in the 17th century.Batcock ibid. p51. The ruined Chapel of St Andrew is Grade II* listed. Notable buildings Apart from the two churches, Ringstead has fourteen other listed buildings. These comprise the farmhouses at Bluestone, East End and Geddings Farms; the War Memorial; the Gin Trap Inn (the 17th century village pub), the village windmill, the Ringstead Gallery, 22-26 High Street and residences called Old Rectory, Ringstead Bury House, Ringstead Bury Stables, Rose Cottage, The Lodge and The White House. Downs The Ringstead Downs comprise a partly wooded chalk ridge to the south-west of the village, and is important for it unimproved chalk grassland. A permissive footpath runs through it and links Ringstead to the nearby resort town of Hunstanton. Transport The village is isolated. Although country lanes radiate to neighbouring villages, there is no A or B road, no direct route to the nearest town of Hunstanton and no public transport. There has been no bus service since the shutdown of the Stagecoach in Norfolk bus company in 2018.

It ran on ITV for two series between 1982 and 1984. It was originally planned that popular wrestler Big Daddy would host and that it would be called \\"Big Daddy's Saturday Show\\". A pilot show was recorded with Big Daddy presenting, assisted by Isla St Clair and short films were shot with Big Daddy to insert in the upcoming series; a trailer for \\"Big Daddy's Saturday Show\\", complete with logo was shown on ITV the Saturday morning before the show was due to air. It was then announced during the week that Big Daddy was dropping out and that Isla St Clair would now take the lead, with ex-Magpie host Tommy Boyd assisting and with Jeremy Beadle being used as an occasional \\"stand in\\" host. The actor David Rappaport was also a fixture playing the character \\"Shades\\" who had also been in the final series of Tiswas, as was footballer Jimmy Greaves. It was never made publicly clear why Big Daddy dropped out so close to transmission; no settlement was ever reached between him and Central. The second series of the show featured a regular technology spot called \\"Interface\\". Presented by IT journalist Chris Palmer, it featured a couple of notable TV firsts. It broadcast a computer program live which viewers could record from their TV and upload to a ZX Spectrum. The initial attempt failed due to interference on the feed from the studio floor, but it was re-broadcast the following week and many viewers successfully recorded and loaded the programme. The second 'first' for the show was the game \\"Up for Grabs\\" which was a game played live in the studio by a player in their own home via a computer and a modem. The contestant had to steer a robotic arm and pick up prizes from a rotating turntable. This proved incredibly difficult as the contestants found it difficult to gauge the depth of the arm and also the response time of the robot arm was slow.

It is 36 miles north-west of Norwich. Its area of had a population, including Fring, of 613 at the 2011 Census. This was an increase from 540 people and 224 households in the 2001 census.Census population and household counts for unparished urban areas and all parishes. Office for National Statistics & Norfolk County Council (2001). Retrieved 20 June 2009. For the purposes of local government, it falls within the district of King's Lynn and West Norfolk. It lies in a predominantly agricultural valley with main crops of barley, wheat and sugar beat, in a belt of chalk with the small Docking river running through it. This and the many springs feeding it have ensured a good water supply for successive groups of settlers. History The village is recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086. Part of the church, built of flint and stone, is Anglo-Saxon in origin. It is one of 124 round-tower churches in Norfolk. There is archaeological evidence that people have lived here from much earlier times. There are remains of Roman villas, pottery and a gold torc from the Iron Age, and many earlier finds, like Neolithic flint tools found in fields and gardens. Furthermore, it is crossed by two ancient roads – the prehistoric Icknield Way and the Roman- period Peddars Way. =Peddars Way= Sunset across Sedgeford to the Norfolk coast from Magazine Wood Peddars Way Peddars Way, an ancient Roman road, runs through the top end of the village and leads directly onto the Norfolk Coast Path. After Fring, the national trail passes through the hamlet of Littleport, a small row of higgledy-piggledy cottages that now form part of the main village. The route takes walkers past a local landmark Magazine Cottage, built in the 17th century by the Le Strange family during the civil war as a gunpowder magazine. Legend has it that a secret tunnel ran from the old armoury to the church in the heart of the village. Today this small part of Peddars Way has derived its name from this historical building, with Magazine Wood and Magazine Farm just a few steps away. All these properties were formerly owned by William Newcombe-Baker, a local landowner whose estate formed much of the land surrounding the village. He was a founder member of NORMAC, the Norfolk machinery body that did much in the 20th century to bring modern mechanisation to arable farming in East Anglia. Magazine Wood was rebuilt in 2000. From this high vantage point on Peddars Way the sun can be seen setting over the sea – one of the few places this is possible on the east coast of Britain. Peddars Way passes Magazine Wood and crosses the disused West Norfolk Junction Railway. Sedgeford had its own Sedgeford railway station on the line between Wells and King's Lynn, but it closed to passengers in 1952 and to goods in 1964. Sedgeford St. Mary The parish church, Sedgeford St. Mary, is one of 124 round-tower churches in Norfolk. =Archaeological project= Anglo Saxon era skeleton found at the Sedgeford Digsite in Norfolk, 2005. The Sedgeford Historical and Archaeological Research Project (SHARP) was established in 1996 to reconstruct the story of human settlement in the parish. Initially, it focused on the Anglo-Saxon cemetery located to the south of the modern village, but it is an ongoing project expanding to many other sites in the parish.

Khuen, who was born in Moosach and studied with the Munich Jesuits in the early 1620s, spent his entire career in the Bavarian capital as a chaplain to the Wartenberg family and beneficiary at the church of St. Peter. Between 1635 and his death he published at least fifteen books of vernacular sacred songs, some in multiple editions, with simple melodies and thoroughbass accompaniment that mark a distinctive stage in the adoption of sacred monody north of the Alps. All were published in Munich, and the relatively narrow distribution of extant exemplars suggests that they were primarily intended for a local or regional audience. Some of the larger compendia include the Epithalamium Marianum (1644), the Tabernacula pastorum (1650), the Munera pastorum (1651), and the Gaudia pastorum (1655). Khuen's poetry is closely related to that of the Munich \\"tract school\\" with which he was associated, and which included among its more prominent members the Munich court secretary Aegidius Albertinus and the Jesuits Jakob Bidermann, Jeremias Drexel, and especially Jakob Balde. Khuen's songbooks reflect the aims of the Bavarian Counter-Reformation in their insistence on Marian, sanctoral, and Christological imagery; their vernacular poetry and folklike strophic melodies were designed for broad appeal.

One platform remains in use, the other as a staff car park. Wrexham General is to the right. Wrexham General railway station () is a main line railway station and the main railway station serving Wrexham, north-east Wales. It is currently operated by Transport for Wales, but services are also provided by Avanti West Coast who operate a service to London Euston. Until January 2011 Wrexham & Shropshire also operated from here to London Marylebone. The station was first opened in 1846, later becoming part of the Great Western Railway (GWR) network and expanded in 1912. It is one of three railway stations in the central area of the town, one now part of General, named Wrexham Exchange, the other being Wrexham Central. It is the main hub for inter-city services in the area, and as a result 78% of all rail journeys (2006/07) in Wrexham County Borough start or end at the station. It is also a major hub for inter-city services in North Wales. Until the early 1980s what is now platform 4 of Wrexham General, serving the Wrexham Central – Bidston service, was a separate station: Wrexham Exchange. History In 1846 the first steam trains began the Railway Age in Wrexham. The line was originally called The North Wales Mineral Railway and was backed by local businessmen, among whom the developer of the steel works at Brymbo, Henry Robertson, is well known. There have been two railway station buildings on the site. The first was the original was built by the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway in Jacobean style with Dutch gable pediments. The architect for that station was Mr Thomas Penson of Wrexham, who also designed the Shrewsbury and Gobowen stations. It was built on the edge of Wrexham, a town which at the time was heavily industrialised and had many coal mines and steelworks to attract the railway companies. The second station building was constructed by the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1912. The company decided the increasing rail traffic needed newer and more efficient facilities so the station was rebuilt to a standardised GWR 'French Pavilion' design, including ornate crestings on the roof \\"towers\\". The station design was unique in that it used stonework from the original building instead of standard red brick. It survived the Beeching cuts of the 1960s, as a through route for steel produced in Shotton and wood for the Chirk MDF factory. On 24 April 1997, a wagon on an empty coal train derailed at a nearby level crossing. The train carried on for a mile into Wrexham General where the wagons scraped up the platform, damaging it and the station canopy. That prompted a massive refurbishing, including new canopies, a jetwash of the blackened sandstone buildings, and platform retiling along all main platforms. The out-of-use bay platform saw no improvements and retained its 1970s lighting until 2008, when it was refurbished by the Welsh Assembly. The suffix \\"General\\" was used by the GWR and later the Western Region of British Railways to differentiate their main stations from others in the area, which belonged to other companies. Following the Beeching axe, Wrexham General remains the only \\"General\\" station on the National Rail network, and other \\"General\\" stations (including Shrewsbury General and Chester General, which were simply renamed \\"Shrewsbury\\" and \\"Chester\\" respectively) lost the suffix or (like Cardiff General, the last station to lose the \\"General\\" suffix) were re-dubbed as \\"Central\\" stations. Because of the continued presence of two stations serving Wrexham, the other being titled Wrexham Central, the \\"General\\" suffix was retained. Until 1967, Wrexham General was served by GWR, latterly BR Western Region, express services between London Paddington and Birkenhead Woodside, which were withdrawn upon the electrification of the West Coast Main Line. =Wrexham Exchange= Wrexham Exchange, which is now platform 4 of Wrexham General, was originally a separate railway station opened in May 1866 for the Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway (WMCQR). By the time that WMCQR had been bought by the Great Central Railway, the line was a through station connecting to the Cambrian Railways Wrexham Central Railway Station. The station changed hands again in 1921 during the Grouping, to the London and North Eastern Railway, as one of their few stations in Wales. Wrexham Exchange was named as such from 18 June 1951, with Wrexham General applying to all platforms from 1 June 1981. A platform, which is now used as a staff car park, was put out of use to passengers from August 1973. A coal train from Gresford Colliery passes through Platform One in 1959. Services Wrexham General benefits from Inter-City services towards Holyhead, Liverpool Lime Street, Birmingham International via Birmingham New Street, Cardiff Central, London Euston and a Sundays-only service to Manchester Piccadilly. The station is also situated on the Borderlands Line, providing local services towards Deeside and Merseyside for connections to Liverpool Central. = Transport for Wales = A Borderlands Line service at platform 4. An Arriva Trains Wales Class 158 waits at platform 2.  Main weekday services  * Borderlands Line: Wrexham Central to Bidston – mostly operated by Class 150 diesel multiple units. * Cardiff-Holyhead: to via Newport, Hereford, Shrewsbury, Chester, Llandudno Junction and Bangor with some southbound services continuing to Llanelli, via Port Talbot, Neath, and Swansea – mostly operated by Class 175 diesel multiple units. * Birmingham-Holyhead: Birmingham International to Holyhead via Wolverhampton, Telford Central and Shrewsbury – mostly operated by Class 158 diesel multiple units. *Premier Service: to via Newport, Shrewsbury, Chester, Llandudno Junction and Bangor (one service in each direction on weekdays) – this service commenced in early May 2011 using 175 DMUs and was expected to run as a loco hauled service from December 2011 leasing Class 67, Driving Van Trailer and Mark 3 coach sets, however it continued to be operated by Class 175 diesel multiple units as of April 2012, but subsequently went over to loco-haulage at the May timetable change that year.  Other services  * Birmingham-Warrington: Birmingham International to Warrington Bank Quay via Chester and Runcorn East (one evening service on weekdays northbound only) – operated by a variety of diesel multiple units. * Chester/Shrewsbury (Shuttle Service): including Chester to Wrexham General or Shrewsbury to Wrexham General.

These were used for trains to via the Ruabon Barmouth line until the 1960s. Platforms 1 and 2 are on the main to line, platform 3 being on an island platform opposite 2; and platform 4, until the mid-1980s a separate former Great Central Railway station named Wrexham Exchange, was on the ex-Ellesmere to Bidston line, now the Wrexham to Bidston Borderlands Line. Platform 5, once opposite and on the same route as platform 4, became disused when the line was singled, however in 2008 it has been re-surfaced and is now a private parking space. *Platform 1 can accommodate a 10 car train, and is used for long distance southbound intercity passenger services to Shrewsbury, and onwards to Birmingham International (via Telford Central) or Cardiff Central, operated by Transport for Wales, and for services terminating at Wrexham from Chester and London Euston. Due to signalling constraints, trains cannot depart to the north. *Platform 2 can accommodate a 10 car train, and is used for regular northbound passenger inter city and regional services to Chester and services onwards to the North Wales Coast line to Holyhead and for services to Manchester Piccadilly via Chester and Runcorn, operated by Transport for Wales. Inter city Services to London Euston (via Chester and Crewe) are also provided on this platform by Avanti West Coast. Due to signalling constraints, trains cannot depart to the south. *Platform 3 can accommodate a 7 car train, and was used for regular passenger services to London Marylebone via Shrewsbury, Telford Central and Tame Bridge, operated by Wrexham & Shropshire. This platform is now used by a small number of Borderlands Line passenger services (usually the first northbound and last southbound train each day), for services terminating at Wrexham from Shrewsbury and for freight services changing between the Shrewsbury-Chester line and the Borderlands line. This platform is signalled bidirectionally, so trains can depart either south towards Shrewsbury or north towards Bidston, although no services from Shrewsbury currently depart on the Borderlands line and vice versa. In practice this platform is used for trains terminating from either direction. *Platform 4 is located outside the main station canopy and is used for regular branch line passenger services northbound to Bidston, and to Wrexham Central in the opposite direction, operated by Transport for Wales. This platform is signalled bidirectionally, so trains can depart either south towards Wrexham Central or north towards Bidston. Recent developments The station is currently undergoing a renaissance as a number of new services have been introduced. Since 2005 the station has been a stop of the two hourly Cardiff to Holyhead Transport for Wales service (introduced by previous franchise operator Arriva Trains Wales, which occasionally extends to Llanelli. The two hourly Birmingham service has also been extended to Birmingham International and Holyhead. In April 2008, Ieuan Wyn Jones AM, the Deputy First Minister for Wales opened a new Wrexham Network Rail depot. It consisted of the refurbishment of two terminal bay platforms to the south of the station for overnight stabling of trains and the construction of a crew depot. The development was opened to coincide with the start of services from Wrexham General to London by Wrexham & Shropshire, who utilised the depot until services to London Marylebone stopped in January 2011. From February 2009 a cafe has opened on the station in formerly empty office space. In June 2011, construction began on the increased access for disabled people to platform four. The existing footbridge between platforms three and four was removed in preparation for the construction of a new footbridge which includes a lift on Platform four. This obviates the use of the road bridge for disabled access to platform four. The new bridge has been built to modern standards but in a style sympathising with the rest of the station design. The footbridge was installed in a record 12 hours and a timelapse video was shot of the event. On 20 March 2012 it was announced that sections of the North to South Wales line would be upgraded along the Wrexham section of the line to a total of £46 million worth of improvements. These include redoubling the Wrexham – Chester section, and upgrading sections of the line to allow for 90 mph running throughout. This will allow for an increase in traffic between Wrexham and Chester, including further London services and a possibility of regular services to new destinations. One report has suggested extending the hourly First TransPennine Express Hull – Manchester Piccadilly service to Wrexham via Chester, which would provide a direct service to Manchester, Leeds and Hull. Other suggestions include extending the current hourly Chester – Crewe shuttle service south to Wrexham and north to Manchester (via Manchester Airport). Although the engineering work completed in April 2017, no new developments are anticipated until late 2017 at the earliest. Transport for Wales have confirmed plans to introduce peak time services to and from Liverpool Lime Street via Chester and Runcorn, along the Halton Curve, from May 2019.

Bootlegging Little is known of DeMayo's early involvement in organized crime. By 1927, DeMayo was running the Kansas City criminal organization. The Kansas City gang, like other criminal organizations around the country, gained immense wealth and power during Prohibition by bootlegging alcohol. Unlike New York and Chicago, which were wracked by bloody gang wars during this period, the criminal gangs in Missouri had managed to cooperate and avoid bloodshed. Most of murders that occurred during this era were committed by the mob to protect their bootlegging operations in the city and surrounding area. The largest alcohol stills were located in the heavily wooded and inaccessible areas on the Missouri River east of the city limits. Stills were also stationed in well-disguised underground facilities in the Little Italy section on the North Side of Kansas City. One large still was even uncovered on the second floor of a cafe located across the street from the County Courthouse. Federal investigation and prosecution At one point, Federal Prohibition Agents calculated that DeMayo was personally grossing more than $1,000,000.00 annually from the still operations. The U.S. Attorney General soon ordered the Federal Prohibition Agency and the Bureau of Narcotics (DeMayo had begun dealing heroin and other illegal narcotics) to investigate the Kansas City organization. Unlike bosses in other major cities, DeMayo was heavily involved in the day-to-day operations of his organization. This involvement later made it easier for prosecutors to directly connect him to crimes. DeMayo was also arrogant enough to locate his headquarters in an office building directly across the street from the Federal Building downtown. When Prohibition agents set up surveillance on DeMayo's headquarters, they were able to use offices in the Federal Building itself. Early efforts by agents to recruit informants were thwarted due to widespread fear of the mob. Eventually the agents recruited Gus West, who would play a key role in bringing down DeMayo. Using information supplied by West, Prohibition agents managed to introduce undercover agent James Kominakis to DeMayo. Kominakis played the role of a major Illinois bootlegger who wanted to buy large quantities of whiskey for sale in rural Illinois. In April 1927, Robert Carnahan, a DeMayo associate, sold Kominakis a small amount of whiskey and some counterfeit whiskey revenue stamps. Kominakis returned to Kansas City a few days later and asked to buy more whiskey. DeMayo and Carnahan met Kominakis at a Kansas City warehouse and sold him 50 gallons of whiskey. With the sale completed, agents moved in and arrested both gangsters. Downfall In late 1927, DeMayo went on trial, but the case ended in a hung jury and a mistrial. After two more mistrials, federal agents discovered that the Kansas City mob was bribing jurors. The DeMayo man assigned to this task, James \\"Manny\\" Akers, was sent to prison for jury tampering. Two jurors from the third trial were also indicted. On the fourth trial, DeMayo was finally convicted. In April, 1928, DeMayo was fined $10,000.00 and sentenced to two years in prison. Final years Two weeks after DeMayo's conviction, John Lazia assumed control of the Kansas City criminal organization. Upon his release from prison, the federal government deported DeMayo to Sicily. Some accounts state that this ended DeMayo's direct involvement with the Kansas City organization. However, other sources indicate that DeMayo eventually returned to Kansas City, where he died in August 1949. (His obituary in the Kansas City Star on August 2, 1949, says that he died that day at his home, and gave a Kansas City address on Benton Blvd.) External links *The American \\"Mafia\\" - Kansas City Crime Bosses Category:1885 births Category:1949 deaths Category:American mobsters of Sicilian descent Category:Kansas City crime family Category:American mob bosses Category:Prohibition-era gangsters Category:Italian emigrants to the United States ","title":"Frank DeMayo"},{"id":"3416648","text":"Ingoldisthorpe is a village and civil parish in the north-west of the English county of Norfolk.

Roman =Boudica's Revolt= The earliest fire of which there is definitive evidence occurred in 60 AD, during the revolt led by Queen Boudica, whose forces burned the town then known as Londinium to the ground. This fire was so destructive that archaeologists still use the clearly defined layer of ash deposited by the flames to date the strata below the city. =The Hadrianic Fire= Archaeological evidence suggests that some time in the ten years following the visit of Roman emperor Hadrian in AD 122, a huge fire or possibly a series of fires destroyed a area of the ancient city.For the Love of London Only a handful of the more robust Roman buildings, such as the Roman fort at Cripplegate, survived the flames and the city was largely wiped out. Anglo-Saxon Another great fire broke out in London in 675, destroying the Saxon cathedral that was built of wood. The cathedral was rebuilt in stone in the years 675-685. St Paul's Cathedral. Building the Building Fires were also reported for 798 and 982. In 989, a fire occurred \\"that, beginning in Aldgate, [it] burned down houses and churches all the way to Ludgate.\\" Norman A major fire occurred in London in 1087, at the beginning of the reign of William Rufus. It consumed much of the Norman city. St Paul's Cathedral was the most significant building to be destroyed in this blaze, which also damaged the Palatine tower built by William the Conqueror on the banks of the River Fleet so badly that the remains had to be pulled down. Part of the stone from the tower was then used in the reconstruction of the cathedral. The Two Great Medieval Fires of London Before 1666, the phrase \\"Great Fire of London\\" was generally used by Londoners to denote one of two major conflagrations in the early medieval period: =The Great Fire of 1133= The first dates to Pentecost 1133 (May, 14 May), and according to different traditions started either on London Bridge or in the home of the Sheriff of London, Gilbert Becket (Beket), a mercer and father of Thomas Becket. Christopher Brooke, Christopher Nugent Lawrence Brooke, Gillian Keir: London, 800-1216: The Shaping of a City This blaze was so severe that it destroyed most of the city between St Paul's and St Clement Danes in Westminster. The chronicler Matthew Paris records that the fire destroyed St Paul's Cathedral once again, but this was not the case. One indication of the severity of the fire can be seen in assessments of Gilbert Becket's wealth, based largely on his London property, which declined sharply in its aftermath. =The Great Fire of 1212= The second of the two great medieval fires of London, also known as \\"the Great Fire of , began on 10 July 1212 in Southwark, the borough directly to the south of London Bridge. The flames destroyed Our Lady of the Canons (Southwark Cathedral, also known as St Mary Overie) and strong southerly winds pushed them towards the bridge, which also caught fire. London Bridge had only just been rebuilt in stone, and the structure itself survived the blaze. However, King John had authorised the construction of houses on the bridge, the rents from which were supposed to pay for its maintenance, and it appears that these were lost to the flames. The earliest account of the blaze appears in the Liber de Antiquis Legibus (\\"Book on Ancient Laws\\"), composed in 1274 and today the oldest book preserved among the records of the City of London Corporation. This states: :\\"In this year was the Great Fire of , and it burned the church of St Mary [Overy], as also the Bridge, with the chapel there, and the great part of the city.\\" According to later traditions, however, numerous casualties were incurred when a mass of citizens from London rushed onto the bridge at the first signs of fire, intending to cross the river to help extinguish the flames. High winds carried red-hot embers across the river and ignited buildings on the north side of the bridge. This fire trapped a large number of people, many of whom died either in the blaze or while attempting to escape on overloaded boats that had come to their aid. One later chronicle related: :\\"An exceeding great multitude of people passing the Bridge, either to extinguish or quench it, or else to gaze at and behold it, suddenly the north part, by blowing of the south wind, was also set on fire, and the people which were even now passing the Bridge, perceiving the same, would have returned, but were stopped by the fire.\\" Some estimates put the number of people killed on London Bridge alone at 3,000, and this figure appears in the Guinness Book of Records, although it is not contemporary. Ben Johnson thinks that this is an exaggeration as, at the time, the whole population of London was no more than 50,000 - his rationale for suggesting that 3,000 deaths out of 50,000 is implausible is not, however, explained. Nevertheless, no reliable evidence survives to allow an accurate estimate of the number of casualties caused by the great fire of 1212, but it is known that the damage done to London Bridge was such that the structure remained a ruin, only partially usable, for years afterwards. Other notable fires There were other serious fires in London in 1130 and 1132. Further major fires of London are noted in 13th century London in the years 1220, 1227, and 1299, but none that had the impact of the Great Fire of 1212. Another fire broke out in 1633, destroying 42 premises on the northern third of London Bridge and a further eighty buildings on Thames Street. Some of these buildings were not repaired or replaced, and this accidental \\"firebreak\\" prevented the bridge from being damaged by the Great Fire of London three decades later in September 1666.

He served as the head football coach at Louisiana Tech University in 1987, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1997 to 2000, and East Tennessee State University (ETSU) from 2013 to 2017, compiling a career college football record of 31–48. Torbush was also the head baseball coach at Southeastern Louisiana University from 1977 to 1979, tallying a mark of 75–58. On December 8, 2017, Torbush announced his retirement from coaching. Early life Born in East Spencer, North Carolina, Torbush relocated with his family to Knoxville, Tennessee at age 11. He attended Austin-East High School in Knoxville, where he played in multiple sports. He received athletic scholarship offers from various Division I schools, but decided to walk-on at the University of Tennessee. After having no playing time as a freshman, he transferred to Carson-Newman College in Jefferson City. As a senior at Carson-Newman, he received first-team NAIA All- American honors in both baseball and football. Torbush graduated from Carson- Newman in 1974. After college, Torbush coached briefly at Carter High School in Knoxville. In February 1975, he signed with the Kansas City Royals. Following his one-season pro baseball career, he went to Baylor University to begin his collegiate coaching career. He received his master's degree in physical education and health from Baylor in 1976. Assistant coaching He began his career as an assistant coach for the Baylor Bears, and later coached for the Southeastern Louisiana Lions, the Ole Miss Rebels, the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs, the Alabama Crimson Tide, Texas A&M; Aggies, and the Carson-Newman Eagles. Torbush was part of some mild success at Ole Miss, where he was defensive coordinator from 1983 to 1986. The 1986 season saw Ole Miss compile an 8–3–1 record including a season-ending 20–17 win at the Independence Bowl over Texas Tech. The 1986 Rebel defense allowed opponents an average of less than 13 points per game and statistically ranked as the best defense in the Southeastern Conference. It was after that 1986 season that Torbush was hired away to become head coach at Louisiana Tech. Torbush stepped down as defensive coordinator at the University of Kansas on May 31, 2011, due to low grade prostate cancer. He was set to begin his second season in this role. In January 2012, Torbush was introduced as the linebackers coach with Liberty University. Head coaching =Louisiana Tech= Under Torbush, the team recorded a 3–8 season in 1987 highlighted by the defense and a win over Kansas. =North Carolina= After only one year as head coach at Louisiana Tech, Torbush joined the UNC coaching staff in 1988 as defensive coordinator and linebackers coach. He was the only member of Mack Brown's original coaching staff to stay throughout Brown's 10-year tenure. He recruited and coached many defensive standouts; his 1995, 1996 and 1997 units led the nation in total defense three years in a row and were often regarded as the best in the country. Torbush was a 1997 finalist for the Broyles Award, given annually to the nation's top assistant coach. During his time at UNC, at least one of his linebackers went pro every year. Among his more notable players were Julius Peppers, Brian Simmons, Greg Ellis, and Dré Bly. After the 1997 season, Brown announced he was moving to the University of Texas. He left the team immediately, and Torbush was named to replace him. He coached the team in the 1998 Gator Bowl, capping off one of the Tar Heels' best seasons ever. The Tar Heels finished with an 11–1 record, only the third 11-win season in school history. They also finished sixth in the AP Poll and fourth in the coaches' poll—their highest ranking in the major media polls in half a century. North Carolina credits the 1997 regular season to Brown and that Gator Bowl to Torbush. Despite the loss of most of the team's defensive stars of the last three years, the Tar Heels were expected to pick up right where they left off in 1998. However, they never really recovered from an unexpected loss to Miami (Ohio) to open the 1998 season, in which they barely managed to qualify for the Las Vegas Bowl. The next year was an unmitigated disaster. The team was riddled with injuries, the most devastating one occurring when quarterback Ronald Curry tore his Achilles tendon. The Tar Heels were so thin at quarterback that they were forced to convert safety Antwon Black to quarterback, but he was lost after two games to mononucleosis. After starting the season 1–1, the Tar Heels didn't win another game until beating North Carolina State in November. They finished 3–8—UNC's first losing season since Brown's two consecutive 1–10 seasons in 1988 and 1989. School officials actually planned to fire him after the season, but an outpouring of support from players and fans led to a change of heart. He was, however, forced to fire several members of his staff, including offensive coordinator Steve Marshall, who had been criticized for being too conservative in his play calling. The Tar Heels rebounded to finish 6–5 in 2000, but it wasn't enough to save his job; he was fired at the end of the season. =East Tennessee State= Torbush established the newly restarted program at East Tennessee State, which had last played in the 2003 season. The Buccaneers signed their first class in 2014, redshirting all players, and began a year of practice in preparation for the 2015 season, when the team competed as an NCAA Division I FCS independent. In the 2016 season they joined the Southern Conference. On December 8, 2017, Torbush announced his retirement from coaching. In his time as ETSU head coach, he had an overall record of 11–22 record with 4–12 mark in SoCon play. Overall, he finished with a 31–48 career head coaching record. Head coaching record *Torbush led the Tar Heels in the 1998 Gator Bowl, the final game of the 1998 season, as a result of Mack Brown leaving UNC for Texas the week prior to the Gator Bowl.

Strongly associated with the labour movements of developing countries, social movement unionism is distinct from many other models of trade unionism because it concerns itself with more than organizing workers around workplace issues, pay and terms and conditions. It engages in wider political struggles for human rights, social justice and democracy. Social movement unionism grew out of political struggles in developing countries and was theorized as a distinct industrial relations model in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In this model, trade unions are not distinct from social movements and form part of a wider ecosystem of political activism that includes faith groups, civic and residents' organizations and student groups. These are usually organized into democratic umbrella organizations along a popular front model. The umbrella organization generally has a programme or manifesto that all affiliates commit themselves to. A prime example of social movement unionism is the link between the trade union federation Cosatu and the wider anti-apartheid struggle through the United Democratic Front in South Africa in the 1980s. More recently, Cosatu has successfully campaigned with the Treatment Action Campaign for access to medication for HIV-Aids. Social movement unionism is also a feature of the industrial relations of Brazil and the Philippines. SMU is widely considered to be a highly dynamic and successful model, as evidenced by the success against apartheid and for treatment access, and by the fact that countries practising this model have generally reversed the trend of trade union decline experienced in the developed world. For instance, union density grew in South Africa by 130% between 1985 and 1995, during a period of steep decline in many developed countries. In the developed world, SMU is strongly associated with the organizing model of trade unionism, and overlaps with community unionism. SMU attempts to integrate workers, trade unions and the labour movement into broader coalitions for social and economic justice. Thus, in principle, unions and other organizations support each other in what are seen as mutually beneficial goals. The campus living wage work of unions, which have frequently worked with chapters of United Students Against Sweatshops, are an example of the principle in practice. Similarly, the 'Teamsters for Turtles' (as their T-shirts had it) at Seattle signalled a willingness of sections of the labour movement to engage with environmental concerns. Other prominent examples include the relationship between Reclaim the Streets and the Liverpool Dockers (UK) during their strike in the late 1990s; and the relationship between the Coalition of Immokalee Workers and progressive US students during the Boot the Bell campaign. Various labour–environmental coalitions also fit this social movement model.  Union initiatives  Union support for social justice causes can come from within the scope of their respective collective agreements. Unions are increasingly demanding that new collective agreements contain clauses that are intended to further social justice. The inclusion of social justice support in a negotiated contract, compels all parties to support these causes in a legally binding way. This may extend to funding the education of rank and file union members in various social justice issues (i.e. fair trade policies, anti-poverty initiatives, anti-globalization campaigns and race, gender and human rights issues, etc.) and financial or technical support for non-union causes. Generally speaking, social movement unionism advocates greater levels of democracy and equality for all people, regardless of union membership. =Collective bargaining= During contract negotiations or collective bargaining, some unions are pushing for the inclusion of various social justice clauses to be added to the collective agreement. One example of this may be a demand that a percentage of future wages be transferred to a fund to be used to effect social justice issues nationally or internationally on behalf of the union membership. Another example is a recent trend of demanding a portion of hourly wages to be deferred to a paid education leave (PEL) fund, to allow union members to leave the work place for a period of time, at no loss of pay, so they can attend social justice seminars and educational programs. These demands are forwarded as proposals to the employer during collective bargaining negotiations.

Ray and Sons publishers. It consists of 46 titled and seven untitled short rhymes (quatrains), all considered to be in the genre of literary nonsense. Significance Bengali readers were exposed to a new nonsense fantasy world by the poems in Abol Tabol. This selection offers the best of Sukumar Ray's world of pun-riddled poetry. Although it was not understood at the time of its publication, many poems in Abol Tabol contain skilfully hidden satire on the state of society and administration of early 20th-century colonial India - mostly Bengal. Embedding implied hidden meanings of a subversive nature in nonsense rhymes for children, was Ray's clever way of subverting press censorship by the then British administration in India, which was paranoid about seditious and subversive literature. Timeline and brief explanations of historical events commented upon in the poems of Abol Tabol. In analytical literature since 2017, the poems in Abol Tabol have been plotted on a timeline and compared with contemporaneous events, research having yielded plausible connections between historical events and the commentary and satire hidden in many of the poems.  Publication history  Sukumar Ray wrote for the children's magazine Sandesh, started by his father Upendrakishore, in Calcutta (now Kolkata), right from the time of its first publication in 1913. Ray was living in England at that time, where he had traveled at the end of 1911, to study photoengraving and lithography. He returned to India towards the end of 1913, and, after the death of Upendrakishore in 1915, also became the editor of Sandesh, and remained so till the time of his own untimely death in 1923. The poems in Abol Tabol, most of which first appeared in Sandesh, were composed during the period 1915 to 1923. Abol Tabol, meaning The Weird and the Absurd, was originally the name designating a section within Sandesh magazine, where many of these poems were first published. Thirty-nine poems and seven untitled quatrains can be traced back to having first appeared in Sandesh. Seven other poems making up the balance of the collection known as Abol Tabol were selected by Ray, from perhaps previously unpublished manuscripts, to form part of the final collection. Of these, Ray wrote the first and last poems, both originally titled Abol-Tabol, specifically for the collection, possibly in 1923. Characters His collection had several characters which became legendary in Bengali literature and culture. Some characters even have found idiomatic usage in the language. Some of the most famous characters in \\"Abol tabol\\" are: * Katth Buro (Poem: Katth Buro) * Head Officer Burrobabu (Poem: Gnof Churi) * Kumro Potash (Poem: Kumro Potash) * Gangaram (Poem: Sat Patro) * Chandidaser Khuroe (Poem: Khuror Kal) * Bombagorer Raja (Poem: Bombagorer Raja) * Hnukumukho Hyangla (Poem: Hnukumukho Hyangla) * Ramgorurer Chhana (Poem: Ramgorurer Chhana) * Tnyash Goru (Poem: Tnyash Goru) * Shashtthi Charan (Poem: Palowan) * Panto Bhoot (Poem: Bhooturey Khela) * Nera (Poem: Nera Beltolay Jay Kobar) * Katukutu Buro (Poem: Katukutu Buro) Bibliography English Translations of Abol Tabol, in reverse chronological order (newest first).

He was the head coach at Mississippi State University from 2004 to 2008, and the first African American head football coach in the Southeastern Conference. His father, Sylvester Croom Sr., was himself an All-American football player at Alabama A&M;, later the team chaplain at the University of Alabama, and has been recognized by that school as one of the state's 40 pioneers of civil rights.Pioneers University of Alabama After his time at Mississippi State, Croom Jr. served as running backs coach for three teams in the National Football League. Playing career Croom, a native of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, starred at Tuscaloosa High School as a linebacker and tight end. He was named Outstanding Player his senior year (1971). He then played those same positions before settling in at center for Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant at the University of Alabama, where in 1974 he was a senior captain, earned the Jacobs Blocking Trophy, and like his father years earlier earned Kodak All-American honors. During his playing career there, Alabama garnered three SEC championships from 1972 to 1974 and a national title in 1973. He played one season in the National Football League for the New Orleans Saints before returning to the University of Alabama to begin his coaching career. Coaching career Before coaching at Mississippi State, Croom was an assistant at Alabama for 11 seasons under Bryant and Ray Perkins, one as a graduate assistant coach and ten more variably as inside and outside linebackers coach. During this eleven-year period on the Alabama staff Croom participated in ten bowl games, two national championships in 1978 and 1979, and he coached four eventual NFL first-round draft picks, including Cornelius Bennett and Derrick Thomas. He then spent 17 years in the professional ranks as running backs coach at Tampa Bay, Indianapolis, San Diego, and Green Bay. Before going to Green Bay, he served as offensive coordinator for Detroit from 1997 to 2000, and during his tenure in San Diego was on the Chargers' staff for Super Bowl XXIX. He was a finalist for the head coach position at the University of Alabama in 2003, but the job ultimately went to Mike Shula. In March 2004, Alabama's Sylvester Croom Commitment to Excellence Award, given annually for 16 years to outstanding players, was changed to the Bart Starr, supposedly because Shula did not want an award named for a rival coach. After complaints by alumni and fans, the award was changed back to its original name. When Croom was hired at Mississippi State, he inherited a program that was riddled with NCAA sanctions and had not won consistently since the 1990s. Not just that, but Croom became the first African American in Southeastern Conference history to be given a chance to head coach a football team.”Croom, Sylvester Jr.”’’Current Biography Yearbook’’. The H.W. Wilson Company. 2004. P.100 After the 2007 season, during which his team won eight games, including the Liberty Bowl, Croom garnered Coach of the Year awards from three organizations. On December 4, 2007, Croom was named coach of the year by the American Football Coaches Association for region two. The AFCA has five regional coaches of the year and announces a national coach of the year each January. That same year, on December 5, Croom was named SEC Coach of the Year twice, once as voted by the other SEC coaches and once as voted by The Associated Press. It was the first time a Mississippi State coach received the AP honor since Charley Shira in 1970 and the first time a Mississippi State coach received the coaches award since Wade Walker in 1957. After a 4–8 record in 2008, culminating with a 45–0 loss to rival Mississippi, Croom was asked by school officials to resign as the coach of the Bulldogs. On February 2, 2009, St. Louis Rams head coach Steve Spagnuolo announced that he hired Croom to his coaching staff to be the team's running backs coach.Rams hire Croom, four other coaches ESPN. Retrieved on February 2, 2009 Croom and the entire coaching staff were fired following the 2011 season in which the team posted a 2–14 record. Croom was hired onto Tennessee Titans head coach Mike Munchak's staff as running backs coach in 2013. Croom was not retained by new Head Coach Mike Vrabel in 2018, and decided to retire after more than 40 years of coaching.https://www.al.com/sports/index.ssf/2018/05/sylvester_croom_on_retirement.html Education Croom earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in history with a minor in biology from the University of Alabama in 1975 at the age of twenty and while a graduate student and coach there earned a master's degree in educational administration in 1977. First black head football coach in the SEC =Responses= Croom has consistently downplayed the personal significance of his status as the first black head coach of an SEC football team. A characteristic response has been that while he is proud of his African-American heritage, the most important part for him is \\"the head coach part\\" and the ability to pursue a dream he has held for all of his adult life, stating notably at a press conference upon his acceptance of the position \\"I am the first African-American coach in the SEC, but there ain't but one color that matters here, and that color is maroon.\\" Elsewhere, in an interview shortly before his first season as a head coach, when asked if as the first African-American coach in the SEC he considered himself \\"a trailblazer,\\" Croom responded \\"I'm just a guy trying to do the best job he can. It just happens that the timing of my hiring puts me in that position. I don't see myself that way. If other people perceive that, so be it. I'm just trying to do the best I can here.\\" However, the initial response to his hiring was lauded by many as a moment of relative cultural significance. An article published in USA Today on the day that Croom was hired listed a few responses from members of the political, cultural, and athletic communities. In it Julian Bond, chairman of the NAACP, noting that the hire was in Mississippi, a state often regarded as having the poorest civil rights record, said that \\"For Mississippi State to place the fortunes of its team in black hands is more than welcome, however long it has taken.\\" In the same article Bennie Thompson, the lone black member of Mississippi's U.S. congressional delegation, said that the hiring \\"speaks well of Mississippi State. Mississippi State alumni and friends are more concerned about winning than the color of the coach. There's still a lot of work to be done by other schools.\\" On February 12, 2007 in observance of Black History Month President George W. Bush, at a gathering of African-American leaders and dignitaries where Croom was present, recognized the efforts and achievements of NFL football coaches Tony Dungy and Lovie Smith, both acquaintances of Croom and a friend in Dungy's case. The President went on to state that he was \\"proud to be [there] with another football coach who deserves a lot of credit, Sylvester Croom, who is the head football coach from Mississippi State University. His achievement is the first African American coach in the Southeastern Football League -- Southeastern Conference. He was picked because he's a strong leader and a fine man. And I thank you for blazing trails.\\" In February 2008 Croom was featured in a half-hour segment of \\"Say it Loud,\\" ESPN's documentary celebration of Black History Month. In it are featured interviews with Croom along with coaches and players, among others. Relevant to the topic he speaks generally in this documentary on his decision to accept Mississippi State's offer for the head coaching position and on his race and the history of race relations in the region being major contributing factors. Likewise, in a 2009 interview focusing on his work with the St. Louis Rams, Croom spoke to his relevance to racial and cultural integration, saying \\"It's just worked out in my career where I've had that opportunity to be the first African-American in a lot of situations.\\" He continued to say that \\"...it was never anything that was planned. It's just the way this life has gone for me, and the opportunities that I've been blessed with. In retrospect, I do take some pride in it, and some sacrifices that I've had to make along this way. But so does everybody else.\\" =Position at Alabama= Croom's own position on African-American coaches in college football has not always been so apolitical, however. In an interview with Black Athlete Sports Network in July 2003, after losing out to Mike Shula in the head coach vacancy for the University of Alabama, Croom speculated that race was more of a factor in that hiring process than University of Alabama athletic director Mal Moore let on and that he lost the job because of it. \\"I have a real problem there,\\" he said. \\"A lot of those [SEC] schools, guys are good enough to play for them, good enough to be assistant coaches and not good enough to be in the positions of decision making and the positions of high financial reward. And they're qualified.\\" In that same interview with Black Athlete Sports Croom acknowledged that he \\"had great support from the former players and the fans there and even some people within the administration,\\" but that \\"Somewhere in the final process, somebody made another decision.\\" His initial impression of the interview with Alabama was that it was fair and was so positive that he considered himself to be the lead candidate afterwards, which was why he was so surprised when the offer was given to Shula, a coach with over ten fewer years of coaching experience. Afterwards the Rev. Jesse Jackson got involved, calling for an investigation into the hiring practices at Alabama and all SEC schools. Croom's response to Jackson's intervention was that \\"Rev. Jackson did his job. Because quite often, inside the business you can't draw attention to things. He is a voice for a great mass, for a lot of people who don't have a voice.\\" On the question of Croom's timing in his response to this issue being given only after Jackson's call for investigation, he continued by saying that \\"in this particular case, I felt I could speak for myself. I chose not to say anything at that particular time because there was just too much emotion.\\" =Legacy of segregation= Elsewhere, Croom has treated his status as the first African-American head football coach in the SEC with the complexity he sees befitting the situation of a person so deeply connected to the American South. In a 2004 interview with The Washington Post Croom said of his situation in Mississippi that \\"There's much more at stake here than football. The fact that I'm African American, that I'm the State football coach -- well, I think it will have a positive impact on race relations in the state of Mississippi, and how the rest of the country views Mississippi. The place has changed a great deal. I don't know how many people outside here understand that. But they're about to find out.\\" In a 2003 article for the New York Daily News, Croom recalled his experiences of integration as a middle schooler in Tuscaloosa, the near- lynching of his father years before in a case of mistaken identity, and segregated restrooms, an institution which he said “bothered me [then], and it still does to this day.\\" His younger brother Kelvin Croom, a pastor and high school administrator, added: \\"We chose not to be intimidated. We chose to be motivated and hoped that one day we would make a difference. And we have made a difference, because the crosses have been taken down and the ropes have been put away.\\" Head coaching record References Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:American football offensive linemen Category:Alabama Crimson Tide football coaches Category:Alabama Crimson Tide football players Category:Detroit Lions coaches Category:Green Bay Packers coaches Category:Indianapolis Colts coaches Category:Jacksonville Jaguars coaches Category:Mississippi State Bulldogs football coaches Category:National Football League offensive coordinators Category:New Orleans Saints players Category:San Diego Chargers coaches Category:St. Louis Rams coaches Category:Tampa Bay Buccaneers coaches Category:Tennessee Titans coaches Category:Sportspeople from Tuscaloosa, Alabama Category:Players of American football from Alabama Category:African-American coaches of American football Category:African-American players of American football ","title":"Sylvester Croom"},{"id":"3416768","text":"Pierces Creek may refer to: * Pierces Creek, Queensland, a town in Queensland, Australia * Pierces Creek, Australian Capital Territory, a former forestry settlement on the outskirts of Canberra ","title":"Pierces Creek"},{"id":"3416770","text":"Yuwipi is a traditional Lakota healing ceremony.

Yuwipi Ceremony =Spirits= The spirits called upon vary with individual medicine men, as well with the goals of the ceremony. The spirits may be human ancestor spirits or they can be animal spirits. Animal spirits can be birds or they can be four-legged animals. =Yuwipi Men= The yuwipi man is the healer and the one who is tied up and directs the ceremony. During the ceremony he calls spirits that can help the people. While the traditions and protocols are passed down through generations of healers, each Medicine Man has his own way of conducting the ceremony. =Ceremony= It is important for the people in attendance to follow specific rules. The medicine man's chanupa (ceremonial pipe) is present during the ceremony,Encyclopedia of Native American Healing by William S. Lyon, W. W. Norton & Company (March 17, 1998) which involves prayer, the drum, and traditional songs. Some songs summon the spirits, and others tell the spirits it is time to leave and end the ceremony. The ceremony is often very draining for the yuwipi man because of the focus needed to interact with the spirits and because the spirits use his life energy to heal the participants. Due to this, yuwipi men often live short, difficult lives.

It is located in the barrio of Recoleta in Buenos Aires. The library is named after Mariano Moreno, one of the ideologists of the May Revolution¿Por qué Mariano Moreno?, Clarín, 25 May 2010 and its first director. The National Library is an agency under the Ministry of Culture of Argentina. History =Public Library of Buenos Aires= Originally named the Public Library of Buenos Aires and founded in September 1810 by decree of the first Government Junta of the May Revolution first Government Junta, it later became the country’s only national library when it redefined its mission in 1884 and formally changed its name to the National Library of Argentina. The first headquarters, an old 18th century mansion that belonged to the Jesuits, was located on the corner of Moreno Street and Peru Street, within the historic Jesuit site known as the Manzana de Las Luces. Mariano Moreno, the first director, prompted the creation of the Library as part of a package of measures aimed at forging a public alert towards political and civic life. Moreover, the foundation of the Public Library was laid upon the vindication of public education and instruction as a means for building an autonomous country. The initial collection was interwoven with the struggle for independence and was gathered from the expropriated personal collection of Bishop Orellana as well as the patriotic donations of the Cabildo, the Real Colegio San Carlos, Luis José Chorroarín, and Manuel Belgrano. The library’s first chief directors were Dr. Saturnino Segurola and Fray Cayetano Rodriguez, both men of the Church. They were followed by Chorroarín and Manuel Moreno (brother and biographer of the founder). The lineage of directors which followed is still considered a crucial part of the Argentine intellectual and historic fabric: Marcos Sastre, Carlos Tejedor, José Mármol, Vicente Quesada, Manuel Trelles, and José Antonio Wilde. =National Library= When Buenos Aires became the capital of the Republic, the Public Library of Buenos Aires became the National Library and Antonio Wilde was appointed as its director. Wilde’s tenure did not last long due to his old age and death after a sudden illness. Paul Groussac followed his directorship. Groussac created a methodical classification system based on Brunet’s bibliographic model, undertook the cataloging of the manuscript collection, and published two remarkable journals: La Biblioteca, being one of the most prestigious literary journals, and Los Anales de la Biblioteca. The former main building Another milestone was the opening of the building on Mexico Street (in the Montserrat ward) in 1901, a building which was originally designed for the National Lottery. This is the reason early visitors unfamiliar with the story of the building were commonly surprised when walking a staircase adorned with lottery-ornaments. During Groussac’s forty-year administration the library’s patrimony was also enriched with many important donations including Angel Justiniano Carranza‘s personal collection, 18,600 volumes from the nineteenth- century legal expert Amancio Alcorta, and Martín García Merou’s collection - which included valuable papers regarding the foundation of the city of Buenos Aires. Ironically, just as the former director Mármol and the future director, Borges, Groussac developed blindness. He still operated as the National Library’s director for some years before dying in 1929. In 1931 the widely known novelist Gustavo Martínez Zuviría was appointed as the Library’s eighteenth director. During Martinez Zuviria’s tenure the modernization of services and the growth of the library collection became his focus; both of which enhanced the nation’s heritage. Among the many purchases and donations received, it is important to highlight his purchase of the Foulché-Delbosc collection. The next director, whose presence is one of Argentina’s key twentieth century intellectual figures, was Jorge Luis Borges. He managed the institution along with the vice director Edmundo José Clemente from 1955 through 1973. Shortly after his appointment he was informed that he needed to give up reading and writing because of his weakened vision. =New Building= Clemente, his second-in-command and his close friend , was very involved in the construction of the new building, located at the site of the Unzué Palace, the official residence where President Juan Perón and his late wife Evita resided. Following a politically motivated demolition of the Unzué Palace in 1958, the grounds were designated for the library's new main building. The brutalist structure was designed in 1961, though construction did not begin until 1971. The new library was inaugurated on April 10, 1992. The successive changes in government leadership and bureaucracies, along with certain indifferences towards cultural matters were factors that delayed the project originally envisioned by the architectural team of Clorindo Testa, Francisco Bullrich, and Alicia Cazzaniga. With the creation of the new building the need for trained staff for the library led to the founding of the National School of Librarians at the old building.

The text, with the 13th-century translation into Persian by \`Ali Kufi of an undated, original but unavailable Arabic text, has long been considered to be the stories of early 8th-century conquests of Muhammad bin Qasim. According to Manan Ahmed Asif, the text is significant because it was thought to be a source of colonial understanding of the origins of Islam in the Indian subcontinent through Sindh region and influenced the debate on the partition of British India. Its story has been a part of state-sanctioned history textbooks of Pakistan, but the text in reality is original and \\"not a work of translation\\". Islamic scholars and modern historians question the credibility of some of the Chach Nama's reports.Friedmann, Yohann (1984), \\"The origins and significance of the Chach Nāma\\", Islam in Asia: South Asia, Magnes Press/Westview Press, pp. 23–37, The Chach Nama is a romantic work influenced by the 13th-century history, not a historical text of the 8th-century, states Asif. Contents The report contains an introductory chapter about the history of Sindh just before its conquest by the Arabs. The body of the work narrates the Arab inclusions into Sindh of the 7th-8th centuries AD. Thus it chronicles the Chacha Dynasty's period, following the demise of the Rai Dynasty and the ascent of Chach of Alor to the throne, down to the Arab conquest by Muhammad bin Qasim in early 8th century AD.The Chachnamah, An Ancient History of Sind, Giving the Hindu period down to the Arab Conquest.

Historical significance As one of the only written sources about the Arab conquest of Sindh, and therefore the origins of Islam in India, the Chach Nama is a key historical text that has been co-opted by different interest groups for several centuries, and it has significant implications for modern imaginings about the place of Islam in South Asia. Accordingly, its implications are much disputed.E.g. Syed Nomanul Haq, 'Gujarati Sandals in Baghdad: Decolonising History' [review of Manan Ahmed Asif, A Book of Conquest: The Chachnama and Muslim Origins in South Asia (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2016)], Herald (19 November 2016), http://herald.dawn.com/news/1153594/gujarati- sandals-in-baghdad-decolonising-history. According to Manan Ahmed Asif, the Chach Nama has been historically significant. It was a source of colonial understanding of the origins of Islam in the Indian subcontinent through the Sindh region.: \\"this thirteenth-century Persian text became, in colonial understanding, a history of Muslim origins\\". The text has been one of the sources of historiography and religious antagonism during the South Asian people's struggles to gain independence from the colonial British Empire. The text, states Asif, has been a source of a colonial construction of a long history of religious antagonism between Hindus and Muslims, and one of narratives of Muslim origins in South Asia by various twentieth-century historians and writers. It has been a part of state-sanctioned history textbooks of Pakistan. The story of the seventeen-year-old Muhammad bin Qasim's attack on \\"Pak-o-Hind\\" was mentioned by the Pakistani professional Faisal Shahzad prior to his 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt. Origins, authorship, and preservation =Translation of Arabic original= As we have it today, the Chach Nama is the work of ʿAlī b. Ḥāmid b. Abī Bakr Kūfī.

Consulted online on 04 December 2016 DOI:10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_8436. According to Y.

The Chach Nama survived in the following key manuscripts: British Library Or. 1787; India Office, Ethé 435. =Original work= According to Manan Ahmed Asif, Chach Nama is not a work of translation nor is a book of conquest. ʿAlī states that he wrote it to gain favor in the court of Nasiruddin Qabacha (Nasir ad-Din Qabacha). Asif adds that Qasim's campaign in Chach Nama is a deliberate shadowing of campaigns Chach undertook in \\"four corners of Sindh\\". He states that the Chach Nama is centred on the historical figure of Muhammad bin Qasim found in extant Arabic manuscripts, but the 13th-century text is different, creatively extrapolating the alternative versions. For example, the version of Qasim story found in the Kitab Futuh al-Buldan of the 9th-century Al-Baladhuri and the version found in memoirs of 11th-century Al-Biruni, are much simpler, \\"markedly different\\" in structure, circumstances and martial campaign than that elaborated in the Chach Nama. In the Baladhuri version, for example, Qasim does not enter or destroy budd (temples) or call them \\"like the churches of the Christians and the Jews and the fire houses of the Magians\\". Further the Baladhuri version of the Qasim story repeatedly credits the monks and priestly mediators of Hind with negotiating peace with him, while Chach Nama presents a different, martial version. The Chach Nama drew upon Baladhuri's work, and others, as a template for the political history, but created a different and imaginative version of events. According to Asif, \\"there is little reason for us to consider the facticity\\" of verses in the Baladhuri's version either, an account written to glorify the martial conquest of courtly Abbasid times and composed over 200 years after Qasim's death. The Chach Nama is a romantic work influenced by the 13th-century history, not a historical text of the 8th-century, states Asif. Accuracy The Táríkh Maasúmí, and the Tuhfatulkirám are two other Muslim histories of the same period and, on occasion, give differing accounts of some details. Later Muslim chronicles like those by Nizamuddin Ahmad, Nurul Hakk, Firishta, and Masum Shah draw their account of the Arab conquest from the Chach Nama. Scholars such as Peter Hardy, André Wink and Yohanan Friedmann, question the historical authenticity and political theory embedded in the Chachnama because of its geographical errors, glaring inconsistencies with alternate Persian and Arabic accounts of the Qasim story, and the missing Arabic tradition in it even though the text alleges to be a Persian translation of an Arabic original.Peter Hardy (1982), Is the Chach Nama intelligible as Political Theory?, in Sind through the Centuries, Ed: Hamida Khuro, Oxford University Press, , pages 111-117Andre Wink (2002), Al-Hind, the Making of the Indo- Islamic World: Early Medieval India and the Expansion of Islam 7th-11th Centuries, Brill Academic, , pages 192-196 Editions and Translations * Elliot, H.

By reading fees, and by selling his books at readings, he was able to make a living from his poetry alone.\\"Wilson (Pugsley) MacDonald Biography\\", Dictionary of Literary Biography, BookRags.com, Web, May 10, 2011. In the 1920s he was so popular that, according to writer John Robert Colombo, \\"his fame eclipsed that of Robert Service and Pauline Johnson.\\"John Robert Colombo, \\"Wilson MacDonald\\", Canadian Literary Landmarks (Hamilton: Dundurn, 1984), 205, Google Books, Web, May 10, 2011. Life Wilson MacDonald was born in Cheapside, now part of the municipality of Haldimand, Ontario. He attended McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, and graduated in 1902.Douglas Fetherling, \\"MacDonald, Wilson Pugsley,\\" Canadian Encyclopedia (Edmonton: Hurtig, 1988), 1262. He began publishing poetry in the Toronto Globe in 1899, while still a student. Canadian poet Albert E. S. Smythe described MacDonald as a \\"slight, lithe, graceful Italian figure, the same dark eyes and olive complexion, the same inscrutable smile of the shy but friendly soul\\". After graduating, MacDonald worked at a number of jobs. As he later wrote: \\"I have been, in my varied career, a view agent, seaman, cabin-boy, bartender (one night), school- teacher, actor, inventor, producer, playwright, composer, advertisement writer, newspaper reporter, editorial writer, columnist, banker, and poet. When my poetry would not sell, circumstances forced these other tasks upon me.\\"Donald Stephens, \\"Wilson MacDonald Biography\\", Encyclopedia of Literature, 8259, JRank.org, Web, May 10, 2011. His first collection of poetry, Song of the Prairie Land, was published in 1918. In 1921 MacDonald self-published a book of Christian poetry called The Miracle Songs of Jesus. Because he refused to be anything but a fully committed poet, now that he had been published, in the early 1920s \\"MacDonald managed to\\" find a way to \\"supplement his income by engaging in lengthy and rather successful tours of readings and lectures\\". He became what Doug Fetherling in the Canadian Encyclopedia called \\"a barnstorming versifier with an unbending faith in his own greatness\\". MacDonald travelled both Canada and the northern United States reciting his poetry in large city and small town alike. \\"His personal shyness disappeared on stage, where he became dynamic; humming, chanting, and singing, he synchronized his whole performance to make poems come alive for his audience.\\" MacDonald was not the first Canadian poet to make a living from performance; Pauline Johnson had done so 30 years before. But he is the first noted for merchandising his tours. Fetherling noted, with an apparent shudder, MacDonald's books that \\"he himself hawked at his 'recitals. And not just books. MacDonald \\"was something of an artist, a designer. Frequently he illustrated his own poems and dabbled with illumination and typography.\\" There are many examples online of individual poems illustrated or calligraphed by MacDonald, which look like merchandising aimed at those unwilling or unable to buy a whole book. Of course, everything bought at a performance could also be autographed; MacDonald, like George Moore before him, or A. Edward Newton, was an author whose books are seldom found unsigned. MacDonald's most popular work, Out of the Wilderness (1926), went into ten editions. Critics seldom paid attention to his work, and his work was not taught in schools. MacDonald went around that barrier by reciting his poetry for free in high school auditoriums across Canada, paying for it with his merchandising. \\"He was the one poet a generation or two of Canadian students had ever seen or heard.\\" A fan club, the Wilson MacDonald Poetry Society, was active in several cities, including in the United States, \\"and at least one such group still survives\\". From 1953 on, when MacDonald was in his 70s and no longer performing, the Poetry Society supported him financially. He died in Toronto on April 8, 1967. Writing In a 1933 talk on \\"Canadian Poetry in its Relation to The Poetry of England and America\\", Charles G. D. Roberts singled out MacDonald as one of three postwar poets representative of modern trends. Roberts said of him: \\"Wilson MacDonald is purely a lyricist, with a very wide range of form and theme. His best work is forged in the white heat of emotion and is always definitely stamped with his own personality. It is primarily subjective. In his shorter, personal lyrics, such as 'Exit,' he achieves at times an unforgettable poignancy. In his passionately humanitarian poems he is modem in spirit, but in form he is distinctly classical.\\"Charles G.D. Roberts, \\"Canadian Poetry in its Relation to The Poetry of England and America\\", Canadian Poetry: Studies/Documents/Reviews No. 3 (Fall/Winter 1978), CanadianPoetry.ca, UWO, Web, May 10, 2011. (Italics in original.) The Encyclopedia of Literature praised technical aspects of MacDonald's poetry \\"The poems are invariably well balanced because of his musical interest; parts of stanzas are repeated for emphasis and direction — as major melodies in music would be — with other lines juxtaposed to heighten the emotional effect.\\" Fetherling was frankly dismissive: \\"It is surprising the extent to which MacDonald was often taken seriously as an artist and equally surprising that genuine poems or hints of them can sometimes be discovered in his collections by those willing to wade through his vapid romanticism and pre- modernist conventions.\\" Some of MacDonald's poetry certainly does not hold up: for example, the books Caw-Caw Ballads and Paul Marchand and Other Poems, which employ dialect verse – here the French-Canadian habitant dialect of English popularized by William Henry Drummond – more entertaining if heard performed rather than read, and even then more embarrassing than entertaining. Other pieces of MacDonald's work stand the test of time. The title poem of his collection Out of the Wilderness has something of the strength of Walt Whitman – \\"I, a vagabond, gypsy, lover forever of freedom, / Come, / Come to you who are arrogant, proud, and fevered with civilization – / Come with a tonic of sunlight, bottled in wild careless acres,/ To cure you with secrets as old as the breathing of men.\\" Roberts said of that poem that MacDonald \\"has been so bold as to experiment frankly with Whitman's peculiar form and content, and he has justified the experiment. He has succeeded at times in breathing into that harsh form a beauty of words and cadences which Whitman never achieved\\". Recognition The Wilson P. MacDonald Memorial School Museum near Selkirk in Haldimand (the school MacDonald attended as a boy) has been designated a National Historic Site of Canada.Canadian Register of Historic Places Dedicated \\"to preserving the history of rural education, the heritage of the surrounding community, and the memory of poet Wilson Pugsley MacDonald\\", the museum \\"allows students to experience a typical day in a 1925 one-room rural school. Costumes, role playing, lessons and games help modern youngsters learn about their heritage and the history of education. The day-long programme is especially tailored to the school curriculum.\\"\\"Wilson MacDonald Memorial School Museum,\\" HaldimandCounty.on.ca, Web, May 11, 2011.

He was the co-captain of Fremantle in 2000 and 2001, the second player to reach 200 games with the club and his 228 games was the second most games played for Fremantle behind Shane Parker at the time of his retirement. Following the retirement of Peter Bell during the 2008 season, McManus became the last remaining player from Fremantle's inaugural squad to still be playing in the AFL. Early career McManus was a highly rated junior player who won the Larke Medal as the best player at the 1993 National Under 17 AFL Youth Championships.Larke Medalists He represented Western Australia, alongside future teammates Peter Bell, Jeff Farmer and Troy Cook. He then won a premiership with East Fremantle in the WAFL in 1994,Hope, Shayne; Shaun McManus hangs up boots; The West Australian; 2008-07-28 before being selected by Fremantle into their initial squad as a pre-draft selection prior to the 1994 AFL Draft.

He continued his good form into 1996 and despite missing 6 games with ankle injuries finished 10th in the Fremantle Best and Fairest award. In Round 3, 1997, he suffered a knee injury in the season's first Western Derby and required a full reconstruction. He returned for the start of the 1998 season, but in Round 6 against Port Adelaide he suffered a recurrence of the injury and required a second reconstruction. Return from injury He returned again in 1999 and played all but five games over the next six seasons. In 2000, his leadership qualities were recognised when he was awarded the co-captaincy of the club alongside Adrian Fletcher. During the Round 4 2001 Western Derby McManus displayed one of the most courageous acts seen in a derby when he ran back with the flight of the ball to take a mark, only to collide heavily with David Wirrpanda. His resilience was displayed when he continued to play after the collision and kicked the goal from the resulting free kick.What is your most memorable Shaun McManus moment ; AFL.com.au; 2008-07-31 He played his 100th game for Fremantle in the second last game of 2001, becoming only the fifth player to do so.

They variously had four albums in the UK Albums Chart between September 1970 and April 1972. One of them, Spinners Live Performance (1971), spent three months in the listing and peaked at No. 14. The Spinners also had 5 top 100 charting singles in Australia, with \\"Working My Way Back to You\\" their best, peaking at number 12 in 1980. Career The band began as a skiffle group with a mainly American repertoire, until they were prompted by Redd Sullivan, a seaman, to include sea shanties and English folk songs. They started out as the Gin Mill Skiffle Group, which included guitarist Tony Davis and washboard player Mick Groves. The group played the Cavern Club, Liverpool for the first time on 18 January 1957, with the Muskrat Jazz Band and the Liverpool University Jazz Band. They played there on a number of occasions during that summer. In September 1958, they became the Spinners. They founded a folk club in Liverpool, the 'Triton Club' (while they were still called 'The Liverpool Spinners'), but soon were performing in London at places such as The Troubadour coffee house. Their first album, Songs Spun in Liverpool (released under the group name of 'The Liverpool Spinners'), was recorded by Bill Leader from live performances. In 1962 Peter Kennedy of the English Folk Dance & Song Society recorded an album with them called Quayside Songs Old & New. In 1963 Philips Records signed them, and they recorded eight more albums over the next eight years. They signed for EMI Records in the early 1970s. They became popular by reviving some of the greatest folk music and singing new songs in the same vein. Although sounding like traditional English folk songs, some of their material was in fact composed by Jones, such as \\"The Ellan Vannin Tragedy\\" and \\"The Marco Polo\\". One of their best known songs, particularly in their native Liverpool, was in \\"My Liverpool Home\\", written by Peter McGovern in 1962. Cliff Hall also introduced traditional Jamaican songs to their repertoire. One of their albums was called Not Quite Folk. They produced over forty albums, and made numerous concerts and TV appearances. In 1970, they were given their own television show on BBC One that ran for seven years. The Spinners Christmas Special attracted large audiences. They also had their own show on BBC Radio 2. They retired in 1988, after thirty years together, although they led the community singing at the 1989 FA Cup Final and played some Christmas shows in the early 1990s. Mick Groves and Hughie Jones still occasionally perform, although Cliff Hall retired to Australia, where he died in 2008, and Tony Davis died in 2017. Their version of the Ewan MacColl song, \\"Dirty Old Town\\", was included in the Terence Davies' 2008 memoir/documentary of Liverpool, Of Time and the City. A biography of the group Fried Bread and Brandy-O (the title of their signature tune) was written by Liverpool journalist David Stuckey (with a foreword by Pete Seeger and an introduction from Deryck Guyler) to coincide with their 25th anniversary. It was published by Robson Books.

Leucaena leucocephala - MHNT Leucaena leucocephala is a small fast-growing mimosoid tree native to southern Mexico and northern Central America (Belize and Guatemala) and is now naturalized throughout the tropics. Common names include white leadtree, jumbay, river tamarind, ipil-ipil, and white popinac.Ipil-ipil, Leucaena glauca, BPI.da.gov.ph L. leucocephala is used for a variety of purposes, such as fencing, soil fertility, firewood, fiber, and livestock fodder.  Use by humans  During the 1970s and 1980s, it was promoted as a \\"miracle tree\\" for its multiple uses. It has also been described as a \\"conflict tree\\" because it is used for forage production but spreads like a weed in some places. The legume is promoted in several countries of Southeast Asia (at least Burma, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand), most importantly as a source of quality animal feed, but also for residual use for firewood or charcoal production. = Forage and fodder = The legume provides an excellent source of high-protein cattle fodder. However, the fodder contains mimosine, a toxic amino acid. Horses and donkeys which are fed it lose their hair. In many cases this acid is metabolized by ruminants to goitrogenic DHP [3-hydroxy-4(1H) pyridone] in the rumen,Hammond, A. C. 1995. Leucaena toxicosis and its control in ruminants. J. Animal Sci. 73: 1487-1492.Allison, M. J., A. C. Hammond, and R. J. Jones. 1990. Detection of ruminal bacteria that degrade toxic dihydroxypyridine compounds produced from mimosine. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 56: 590-594. but in some geographical areas, ruminants lack the organisms (such as Synergistes jonesii) that can degrade DHP. In such cases, toxicity problems from ingestion of Leucaena have sometimes been overcome by infusing susceptible animals with rumen fluid from ruminants that possess such organisms,Allison, M. J., W. R. Mayberry, C. S. Mcsweeney, and D. A. Stahl. 1992. Synergistes jonesii, gen. nov., sp. nov.: a rumen bacterium that degrades toxic pyridinediols. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 15: 522-529. and more recently by inoculating cattle rumina with such organisms cultured in vitro.Graham, S. R., S. A. Dalzell, Nguyen Trong Ngu, C. K. Davis, D. Greenway, C. S. McSweeney, and H. M. Shelton. 2013. Efficacy, persistence and presence of Synergistes jonesii in cattle grazing leucaena in Queensland: on- farm observations pre-and post-inoculation. Animal Prod. Sci. 53: 1065-1074. Such measures have facilitated Leucaena use for fodder in Australia and elsewhere. = Green manure and biomass production = Leucaena leucocephala has been considered for biomass production because its reported yield of foliage corresponds to a dried mass of kg/ha/year, and that of wood 30–40 m³/ha/year, with up to twice those amounts in favorable climates. In India it is being promoted for both fodder and energy.Subabul Reloaded: How One Tree Could Be the Answer to India’s Fodder, Fuel Needs; Published in The Better India, 11 February 2019. It is also efficient in nitrogen fixation, at more than 500 kg/ha/year. It has a very fast growth rate: young trees reach a height of more than 20 ft in two to three years. = Food for humans = The young pods are edible and occasionally eaten in Javanese vegetable salad with spicy peanut sauce, and spicy fish wrapped in papaya or taro leaves in Indonesia, and in papaya salad in Laos and Thailand, where they are known as phak krathin ().ASEAN Biodiversity In Mexico it is eaten in soups and also inside tacos, it is known as guaje. Additionally, the state of Oaxaca in Mexico derives its name from the Nahuatl word huaxyacac, the name for Leucaena leucocephala trees that are found around Oaxaca City. = Pulpwood for paper industry = Recently, the wood part of the Subabul tree is used for making pulp in the pulp and paper industry. In the southern and central states of India, Subabul is the most important pulpwood species for making pulp. It has huge positive socio-economic impact on the livelihood of the small farmers where Subabul is grown as an industrial crop. This provides an alternate crop choice to the farmers of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana states of India where they are also growing cotton and chillies. Invasive properties L. leucocephala is considered one of the 100 worst invasive species by the Invasive Species Specialist Group of the IUCN Species Survival Commission. It is a highly invasive species in the arid parts of Taiwan, The Bahamas, the Hawaiian Islands, Fiji, Puerto Rico, Hong Kong, South Africa, and northern Australia, as well as in South America and Europe.Fonseca, N.G. & Jacobi, C.M. 2011.

In urban areas, it is an especially unwanted species, growing along arid roadsides, in carparks, and on abandoned land. Tree Preservation  Other limitations  This species is susceptible to insect infestations. In the 1980s, a widespread loss in Southeast Asia was due to pest attack by psyllids.ODI - Alley Farming In India, this tree was initially promoted for afforestation due to its fast- growing nature. However, it is now considered unsuitable for urban planting because of its tendency to get uprooted in rain and wind. Eight of every ten trees uprooted by wind in Pune are L. leucocephala. The seeds contain mimosine, an amino acid known to be toxic to nonruminant vertebrates.  Potential as bioherbicidal agent  L. leucocephala is an allelopathic tree. Phytotoxic allelochemicals, such as mimosine and certain phenolic compounds, including p-hydroxycinnamic acid, protocatechuic acid, and gallic acid, have been identified in the leaves of the species.Chou CK, Kuo YL (1986) Allelopathic research of subtropical vegetation in Taiwan.

Omar ibn Khattab, the second in command of the Muslims in history was the first to get the title attributed to himself. The term was frequently used by the leaders of the Islamic Empires of Rashidun, Ummayad and Abbasid. Leaders who uphold Islamic customs and values and fight for its cause and are devoted to the ummah are rewarded the title. The use of the title does not necessarily signify a claim to caliphate as it is usually taken to be, but described a certain form of activist leadership which may have been attached to a caliph but also could signify a level of authority beneath that. The Ottoman sultans, in particular, made scant use of it. Moreover, the term was used by men who made no claim to be caliphs. Term Amir al-Mu'minin is latinized as , hence Italian , French , Spanish and Portuguese , in Byzantine Greek: amermoumnês. It is also translated as \\"Prince of the believers\\" since \\"Amir\\" or \\"Emir\\" is also used as a princely title in states ruled by the royalty or monarchies. Shia view Shias believe that Ali, the son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad and the progenitor of his only continuing lineage, was given the title during Muhammad's era. Shias believe the title is exclusive to Ali. Being called the Commander of the Faithful entails not only political authority, but spiritual and religious authority as well. Sunni view Sunnis generally consider Umar the first person given the title — although according to several famous Sunni scholars, such as Ibn al-Jawzi, Al-Dhahabi, and Ibn 'Asakir, the Prophet Muhammad called Ali by the title Amir al-Muminin. But about the first view, according to the Islamic scholar as-Suyuti (1445–1505): > Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz asked Abu Bakr ibn Sulayman ibn Abi Hathamah the reason > that it used to be written, \\"From the Khalifah of the Messenger of Allah, > may Allah bless him and grant him peace,\\" in the time of Abu Bakr, then > later Umar used to write at first, \\"From the Khalifah of Abu Bakr.\\"? Then > who was the first to write, \\"From the Amir al-Muminin (the Commander of the > Believers)\\"? He said, \\"Ash-Shifa, who was one of the women of the Muhajirun, > told me that Abu Bakr used to write, \\"From the Khalifah of the Messenger of > Allah\\", and Umar used to write, \\"From the Khalifah of the Khalifah of the > Messenger of Allah,\\" until one day Umar wrote to the governor of Iraq, to > send him two strong men whom he could ask about Iraq and its inhabitants. He > sent to him Labid ibn Rabi'ah and Adi ibn Hatim, and they came to Madinah > and entered the mosque where they found Amr ibn al-'As. They said, \\"Get > permission for us (to visit) the Amir al-Muminin.\\" Amr said, \\"You two, by > Allah, have hit upon his name!\\" Then Amr went in to him and said, \\"Peace be > upon you, Amir al-Mu'minin.\\" He said, \\"What occurred to you about this name? > You must explain what you have said.\\" He told him and said, \\"You are the > amir (commander) and we are the muminun (the believers).\\" Thus letters have > since continued to be written with that. An-Nawawi said in his Tahdhib: Adi > ibn Hatim and Labid ibn Rabi'ah named him thus when they came as a > deputation from 'Iraq. It has been said that al-Mughirah ibn Shu'bah named > him with this name. It has also been said that 'Umar said to people, 'You > are the believers and I am your amir,' and so he was called Amir al-Muminin, > and before that he was known as the Khalifah of the Khalifah of the > Messenger of Allah, but they changed from that expression because of its > length. Mu'awiyyah ibn Qurrah said: It used to be written 'From Abu Bakr the > Khalifah of the Messenger of Allah,' and then when it was 'Umar ibn al- > Khattab they wanted to say, 'The Khalifah of the Khalifah of the Messenger > of Allah.' 'Umar said, 'This is lengthy.' They said, 'No. But we have > appointed you as amir over us, so you are our amir.' He said, 'Yes, and you > are the believers, and I am your amir.' Then it became written Amir al- > Muminin. Current usage * The Ahmadiyya Muslim Caliph, Mirza Masroor Ahmad. * According to the Moroccan constitution the King of Morocco is also Amir al- Mu'minin. * The Sultan of Sokoto holds it as a secondary title, although it is sometimes rendered \\"Sarkin Musulmi\\" in the Hausa language. * The leader of the Afghan Taliban * The self proclaimed Caliph of ISIL Past usage * Timur (Tamerlane) * Emperor Aurangzeb of Mughal India. * Muhammad Umar Khan of the Kokand Khanate took on the title. * Abdelkader El Djezairi assumed the title in 1834. * Dost Mohammad Khan was conferred the title in 1836 by the ulama of Kabul, granting legitimacy to his Emirate and his jihad against the Sikh Empire. * Mullah Mohammed Omar was conferred the title in April 1996 by a Taliban-convened shura (assembly) of approximately 1000-1500 Afghan ulama in Kandahar, when he displayed the Cloak of the Prophet before the crowd. The title granted legitimacy to Omar's leadership of Afghanistan and his declared jihad against the government led by Burhanuddin Rabbani. Omar was still referred to as Amir al-Mu'minin by his followers and other jihadists, notably al-Qaeda leader Ayman az-Zawahiri. * Mullah Akhtar Mohammad Mansoor, the successor of Mullah Omar, was conferred the title in July 2015 upon his appointment as the new leader of the Taliban. He was killed in a US drone attack in May 2016. * Molavee Hibatullah Akhundzada, the successor of Mullah Mansoor as the Taliban supreme commander, was also conferred the title upon his election in 2016. * Abu Umar al-Baghdadi was conferred the title after his appointment in October 2006 by the Mujahideen Shura Council as the first Emir of the newly declared Islamic State of Iraq. Non-Muslim usage The Kitáb-i- Íqán, the primary theological work of the Baháʼí Faith, applies the title Commander of the Faithful to Ali, the son-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. A similar (but not the same) title was afforded to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth's monarch as the Grand Duke of Lithuania by the Lipka Tatars, who used to speak a Turkic language. The title of sire was used \\"Vatad\\", as in \\"homeland\\" (\\"Vatan\\"), which meant \\"defender of the rights of Muslims in non-Islamic countries.\\" The Grand Duchy was viewed as a new homeland. Vatad was viewed as a variation on the name Vytautas in Lithuanian or Władysław in Polish, which was known in the diplomatic notes between the Golden Horde and the countries of Poland (Lechistan) and Lithuania (Lipka) as \\"Dawood\\". One can claim that, since Casimir the Great, the Polish-Lithuanian monarch as the King of Poland was tasked with the protection of the rights of the Jews and other non-Christians. In fiction In James Joyce's 1939 novel Finnegans Wake (page 34.6), an informer who is spreading nasty rumours about the main character is described as \\"Ibid, commender of the frightful\\". In the French comic series Iznogoud, Caliph Haroun El Poussah, one of the protagonists of the series, is frequently addressed by inferiors as commander of the faithful (commandeur des croyants in the original French). Margaret Atwood's 1985 dystopian novel The Handmaid's Tale leaders of the fictional Republic of Gilead, a militaristic theonomy, are referred to as \\"Commanders of the Faithful.\\" See also * Almami * Sunni view of the Sahaba * Compare  Fidei defensor  Holy Roman Emperor * Selim I References \\"The Kitáb-i- Íqán PART ONE\\".

Early life Roberts was born in Quetta, British India, on 5 November 1906, the son of a British Army officer, and was educated at Marlborough College and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Military career Roberts was commissioned into the Royal Tank Corps (later the Royal Tank Regiment) of the British Army in 1926. He was posted to Egypt with his regiment from 1928 to 1931, during which time he was promoted to lieutenant on 4 February 1929. Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery, the new commander of the British Eighth Army, and Lieutenant General Brian Horrocks, the new GOC XIII Corps, discussing troop dispositions at 22nd Armoured Brigade HQ, 20 August 1942. The brigade commander, Brigadier \\"Pip\\" Roberts is on the right (in beret). Roberts was an instructor at the Tank Driving and Maintenance School at Bovington, Dorset, from 1933 to 1937. He was again posted to Egypt for 1938 and 1939. In late December 1938 he was serving as adjutant of the 6th Royal Tank Regiment, a position he was still in by the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939. By July 1942, he was commanding the 22nd Armoured Brigade, which he led in the Battle of Alam el Halfa and the Second Battle of El Alamein, before he was transferred in mid-March 1943 to the 26th Armoured Brigade, part of Major General Charles Keightley's 6th Armoured Division. Roberts led the brigade in the final stages of the Tunisian Campaign until the Axis powers surrendered in mid-May. He was Mentioned in Despatches on 15 December 1942, and was awarded a Bar to his Distinguished Service Order (DSO) on 28 January 1943, following which, on February 1943, his rank of major was confirmed, and he was awarded a second Bar to his DSO on 8 July 1943. Major General \\"Pip\\" Roberts (right) with Brigadier C. B. C. \\"Roscoe\\" Harvey of 29th Armoured Brigade, Normandy, 15 August 1944. In June 1943, Roberts handed over the 26th Armoured Brigade to Brigadier Richard Hull and was posted back to the United Kingdom, where for six months he commanded the 30th Armoured Brigade, part of Major General Percy Hobart's 79th Armoured Division. By now recognised as an expert in armoured warfare, Roberts was, aged just 37, promoted to acting major general on 6 December 1943 and became General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 11th Armoured Division (the \\"Black Bull\\"), taking over from Major General Brocas Burrows. He led the division in North West Europe from 1944 to 1945. Landing in Normandy, France, shortly after the D-Day landings on 6 June 1944, Roberts's division was engaged in heavy combat during the Battle of Normandy, most notably in Operation Epsom in late June, followed in mid-July by Operation Goodwood. Following the German collapse in Normandy after the Battle of the Falaise Pocket, the 11th Armoured Division, at the River Seine on 28 August, was in Amiens just three days later, arriving at Antwerp on 3 September, five years since the beginning of the war. His rank of major general was made temporary on 6 December 1944. Playing only a minor role in Operation Market Garden, the division was involved in the Battle of the Bulge and Operation Veritable in February–March 1945. The division crossed the River Rhine in late March and participated in the Western Allied invasion of Germany, in the process liberating the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in mid-April and entering Lübeck in early May. Victory in Europe Day followed soon afterwards. Roberts was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 1 February 1945, and was Mentioned in Despatches on 9 August 1945. Roberts unsuccessfully stood as the Conservative Party candidate for Wimbledon at the July 1945 general election. Roberts commanded the 7th Armoured Division in 1947. His rank of major general was confirmed on 18 June (with seniority backdated to 24 March 1945). He then became Director of the Royal Armoured Corps and retired from the British Army on 11 September 1949. His book From the Desert to the Baltic is an account of all his wartime battles.

His career has focused on television. His mother is Portuguese and his father was German. He is in fact a German citizen: he never acquired dual citizenship, first so he could avoid conscription and the Portuguese Colonial War (1961–74) and secondly because he said “he was not interested”. He went to Lisbon's German school Deutsche Schule Lissabon for all his schooling and is fluent in Portuguese, German, English, and French. He lives in Azeitão, Setúbal, and keeps houses in Lisbon and Vilamoura, Algarve. Television career = Early career = Herman José's professional career started in 1973–4 doing studio choruses (mostly on protest songs spun by the Carnation Revolution of April 1974) and acting in revues. His first leap to national fame was in 1975, invited by comedian Nicolau Breyner on to his TV show \\"Nicolau no País das Maravilhas\\", where he performed opposite the host in a weekly skit called \\"Sr. Feliz e Sr. Contente\\" (\\"Mr. Happy and Mr. Content\\"). His first big success as an author and performer was with O Tal Canal (\\"That Channel\\"), where he played several characters appearing on a fictitious TV channel. With this show, Herman José was attempting to shape the sense of humour of the Portuguese in the wake of the revolution that had ended almost fifty years of totalitarianism under the Estado Novo regime. Hermanias continued his huge success, but the state channel RTP cancelled Humor de Perdição, his next show, after a sketch based on Saint Elizabeth of Portugal caused public outrage. He then turned mainly to daily gameshows like Wheel of Fortune and Com a Verdade m'Enganas (\\"You Fool Me With the Truth\\"), and the talk/game show Parabéns (\\"Happy Birthday\\"). These shows had straight formats that he used for comedy. He returned to comedy in the 1990s, with Herman Enciclopédia and Herman 98, although for the first time the shows were mainly written by other people (from the company Produções Fictícias). = Later career = In 2000, Herman José moved from RTP to the private channel SIC, for a reported 1.5 million euros a year, to host a late-night show called HermanSic. Its sexual innuendo and X-rated acts resulted in low ratings. An attempt to go family-friendly in 2006 was also a failure. In 2007 he presented a new sketch show called Hora H (\\"The Eleventh Hour\\"), and in 2008 he began a new game show called Chamar a Música, which was a success. Then, in September, he began a new series of Wheel of Fortune, once again on SIC. From July to September 2009 he presented Nasci p'ra Cantar (\\"Born to Sing\\"), this time on TVI. In 2009 he received the Top Choice Award for Top International Television Personality of Portugal. After hosting late-night talk shows on the Portuguese television network RTP1, from 2010 to 2013, and the afternoon talk show Há Tarde (translating literally as \\"There is afternoon\\", but serving also as a pun on à tarde, or \\"in the afternoon\\"), alongside Vanessa Oliveira,http://media.rtp.pt/blogs/hatarde/ Há Tarde website Herman returned to comedy, premiering the sitcom Nelo e Idália on RTP1 in October 2015. In 2018, he played the character David Attenburger (a pun on David Attenborough) in two filmed skits during the intervals of the semi-finals of the Eurovision Song Contest held in Lisbon. As Attenburger, he parodied Portugal and its habits in the style of Attenborough's TV series Planet Earth, titled Planet Portugal. Outside television Herman José was a singer and had a popular one-man-show, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which he performed both in Portugal and abroad, entertaining groups of Portuguese emigrants. His discs \\"Saca o Saca-Rolhas\\" (\\"Screw the Corkscrew\\", 1977) and \\"Canção do Beijinho\\" (\\"The Kiss Song\\", 1980) both reached gold record status. He used to own Café Café and Bastidores, two popular bar/restaurants in Alcântara, Lisbon, where he performed stand-up comedy once a week. He is also a partner in the seafood restaurant Jardim do Marisco and the Tivoli Theatre, both also in Lisbon. His expensive tastes include high-end automobiles and motorbikes. He currently owns two Bentleys, a BMW Z4, a BMW Z8, a BMW 7 Series 760, and a Rolls Royce and keeps a large Azimute 55 yacht at the Vilamoura marina. He is known for destroying scenery and props. On the last broadcast of Wheel of Fortune, in 1993, he fired a shotgun live at the scenery and at a TV set. He later justified the act as \\"just wanting to see what it looks like on the inside\\".  Casa Pia scandal  On December 29, 2003, Herman José was accused of various child sexual abuse offences connected with the Casa Pia scandal. In May 2003, he was summoned to appear before the Criminal Court, accused of abusing an adolescent. However, he was able to prove that he was working for the SIC television channel in Brazil at the time. The judge, Ana Teixeira e Silva, dismissed the case.

It was first held in 1989 and has been diminishing greatly in its importance; the last five years have only averaged 8 selections per year, compared to over 50 in each of the first five years.Sinclair, Cameron; NAB AFL Pre-Season and Rookie Draft facts 10 December 2007 It was considered that the pre-season draft only existed to protect the league from writs for restraint-of-trade,Reilly, Stephen; Opening new trade routes next goal ; The Australian; 11 October 2008 but due to the introduction of free agency in 2012, there have been calls to scrap the pre-season draft and extend the free agency period. Eligibility Clubs receive selections in the draft based on where they finished on the AFL ladder during the year, for example, Melbourne finished last in the 2008 AFL season, therefore receiving the first pick in each of the three drafts (national, pre-season and rookie). Teams have the choice of whether to participate in the pre-season draft; many clubs fill their playing roster at the national draft, and hence do not participate in the pre-season draft. Also, unlike the national draft, picks in the pre-season drafts cannot be traded between clubs. Players Historically, the pre-season draft has involved mostly recycled players. Until 2008, due to the standard players contract expiring at the end of November, players who did not wish to sign a new contract with their current club were forced to enter the pre-season draft if they were unable to be traded to another club during the trade week held prior to the national draft. There was no free agency in the AFL to allow uncontracted players to easily move clubs until after the 2012 season. Delisted players had the option of nominating for either the national or pre-season drafts. In 2008 the rules were changed to also give uncontracted players the option of nominating for either draft.Ralph, Jon; Uncontracted players to decide on draft entry; 13 October 2008 However, the number of players being selected after being delisted or coming out of contract is diminishing, as most teams are not prepared to pick them ahead of younger players. The lack of free agency was a powerful bargaining tool during trade week, as the team with the first pick can refuse a trade for a current uncontracted player at another club, and then recruit the player that wants to join their team for free with the first pick in the pre-season draft without giving anything to the other club. Conversely, the threat of losing a player for nothing into the pre-season draft can force a team to trade him for less than the player's true value. The main reason for players not nominating in the national draft is that those who nominate for the pre-season draft may set the terms for their contracts; in contrast, all players selected in the national draft are not able to set a minimum acceptable contract period or salary. Given that changes to each AFL club's playing list is strictly restricted to the three drafts and the trade week, the headline news following each pre-season draft is often who wasn't selected, as much as who was selected. In the 2005 draft this included that Shane Woewodin, the 2000 Brownlow Medal winner, was not selected, and hence would not play football at AFL level in 2006. In 2008, the main story was about whether another Brownlow Medallist, Ben Cousins would be selected, which he subsequently was with Richmond's pick 6.AAP; Tigers confirm Cousins talks; Realfooty.com.au; 12 December 2008 =Number 1 picks= Number 1 picks in the Pre-season drafts are as follows. As the pre-season was originally held towards the end of the pre-season in January or February, the naming of the draft is based on the following season. This is different from the naming of the national draft (which occurs in November), which is named according to the season just completed. Hence the 2008 national draft was held on 30 November 2008, whilst the 2008 pre-season draft was held on 11 December 2007. *1989 – Brian Winton () *1990 – David Cloke () *1991 – Michael McLean () *1992 – Ashley Green () *1993 – Richard Osborne () *1994 – Dermott Brereton () *1995 – Paul Roos () *1996 – Brian McInnes () *1997 – Stephen Paxman () *1998 – Jamie Shanahan () *1999 – David Calthorpe () *2000 – Shane O'Bree () *2001 – Brett Voss () *2002 – Aaron Lord () *2003 – Stephen Powell () *2004 – Jade Rawlings () *2005 – Trent Knobel () *2006 – Dylan McLaren () *2007 – Cain Ackland () *2008 – David Gourdis () *2009 – Liam Jurrah () *2010 – Joel Macdonald () *2011 – Nathan Ablett () *2012 – Aaron Hall () *2013 – Jed Lamb () =Notable pre-season draft picks= *Ben Graham – #40 1992 Preseason Draft *Justin Peckett – #49 1992 Preseason Draft *Darryl Wakelin – #11 1993 Pre-Season Draft *Craig McRae – #22 1993 Pre-Season Draft *Paul Roos – #1 1995 pre-season draft *Peter Vardy – #7 1995 Pre-Season Draft *Tyson Edwards – #21 1995 Pre-Season Draft *Peter Bell – #15 1996 Pre-Season Draft *Stephen Paxman – #1 1997 pre- season draft *Simon Goodwin – #18 1996 Pre-Season Draft *Shane Woewodin – #18 1997 Pre-Season Draft *Joel Smith - #2 1998 Pre-Season Draft *Jared Poulton – #5 1999 pre-season draft *Shane O'Bree – #1 2000 pre-season draft *Brett Voss - #1 2001 Pre Season Draft *Craig Bolton – #3 2003 pre-season draft *Nick Stevens – #2 2004 pre-season draft *Jacob Surjan – #10 2004 pre-season draft *Josh Mahoney – #12 2004 pre-season draft *Eddie Betts – #3 2005 pre-season draft *Scott Camporeale – #4 2006 pre-season draft *Mal Michael – #2 2007 pre- season draft *Cameron Cloke – #9 2007 pre-season draft *Scott Welsh – #4 2008 pre-season draft *Tom Rockliff – #5 2009 pre-season draft *Ben Cousins – #6 2009 pre-season draft *Nathan Ablett – #1 2011 pre-season draft *Bachar Houli – #3 2011 pre-season draft *Cameron Bruce – #5 2011 pre-season draft *Jack Anthony – #6 2011 pre-season draft See also *Australian Football League draft External links *AFL official draft website References Category:Australian Football League draft ","title":"AFL pre-season draft"},{"id":"3416897","text":"is a 1989 vertically scrolling shooter arcade game developed and published in Japan by Namco. Controlling one of three different starships, the player is tasked with destroying an alien race known as the Danger Seed before they wipe out all of mankind. Each ship has their own set of weapons and abilities, such as shots that dissolve enemies and target-seeking projectiles, and can sustain multiple hits before being destroyed. The player's ships can also combine into a new ship, the Moon Diver, featuring a stronger shield and additional weapons. It ran on the Namco System 1 hardware. The game was designed by Yuichiro Shinozaki, a character artist for Namco's own Babylonian Castle Saga franchise, with music composed by Yoshinori Nagumo. Early versions of the game were known as Kristallkern, which remains in-game during the end credits. A conversion for the Sega Mega Drive was released a year later in 1990, which included new features such as additional stages and an arranged soundtrack. Dangerous Seed was met with mixed reviews from critics — although the game was praised for its graphics, fast-paced gameplay and soundtrack, it was criticized for lacking originality and for being unable to stand out among other similar games. Some reviewers stated it was one of the better shoot'em ups released for the Mega Drive. Gameplay Arcade version screenshot. Dangerous Seed is a vertically scrolling shooter video game. The player controls a fleet of ships — Alpha, Beta and Gamma — as they must wipe out the alien race known as Danger Seed before they destroy all of mankind. Each ship features different attack types; Alpha has a standard shot, Beta has a V-shaped laser weapon, and Gamma has the ability to shoot forwards and backwards. All three also have a health meter that will deplete when they are inflicted with enemy fire, and having one of the ships destroyed will cause the player to take control of the next ship. If all three ships are destroyed, the game will be over. The three ships can also find powerncapsules by destroying large \\"Turtle\\" enemies that upgrade their abilities, such as homing missiles, \\"ring lasers\\" that track enemies, and a melt-missile that dissolves enemies when they are hit. The game spans twelve stages, known as \\"tubes\\" in- game, each taking place in planets found in the Solar System. The fifth tube combines the player's ships into a single craft named the Moon Diver, which features all of the weapons and abilities of the three ships and a large health bar. Each tube features a boss fight at the end, which must be destroyed in a certain amount of time before it flees and deducts points from the player's score. Bosses have weak points which must be destroyed before completely defeating it. Development Dangerous Seed was released in Japan by Namco in December 1989, making it the company's final arcade game of the 1980s. It was designed by Yuichiro Shinozaki, who was a character designer for the Babylonian Castle Saga franchise. The game was originally known as Kristallkern in early prototypes, with the end credits still retaining this name — the credits also hint at a follow-up with a vague \\"To be continued\\" message, however a sequel was never released. The soundtrack was composed by Yoshinori Nagumo, which was re-released by Victor Entertainment in 1990. A Sega Mega Drive conversion was released exclusively in Japan on December 18, 1990, adding new features such as additional stages and an arranged soundtrack. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Dangerous Seed on their January 15, 1990 issue as being the seventeenth most-successful table arcade game of the year. The Mega Drive version in particular was met with mixed reviews, being praised for its colorful graphics, fast-paced gameplay and soundtrack yet criticized for its lack of originality and being unable to stand out among other shooters in the market. Japanese publication Famitsu liked the game's fast-paced gameplay, colorful graphics and soundtrack, while German magazine Aktueller Software Markt (ASM) praised its detailed graphics and intense gameplay, labeling it was one of the best shooting games released for the Mega Drive. ASM also liked the game's soundtrack and large, impressive boss fights. Power Play applauded the game's level of suspense and vibrant graphics, alongside its unique enemy designs and power-up items. Super Gaming magazine was the most positive towards the game, who praised its graphics, boss fights, power-up items and \\"sonic-filled\\" gameplay, saying it was one of the most unique shooters available. In their brief review, Raze liked the game's later background designs and fast-paced action. French publication Génération 4 praised the game's \\"beautiful\\" graphics, energetic music and realistic sound effects. Japanese magazine Gamest awarded the arcade version the \\"37th Annual Hit Game\\" award, praising its intense action and detailed graphics. Raze criticized the game for being frustrating to play, as well as disliking many of the game's earlier backgrounds for being unappealing and ugly, while Famitsu stated that the game lacked originality and had a difficult time standing out among other similar games of its genre. Raze also disliked the game's graphics for blending into the background, making it difficult to decipher enemy projectiles and the player's ship. In contrast to Famitsus review, Computer + Video Games magazine thought that the game was too easy, saying that only \\"extremely inexperienced\\" gamers would find the game to be a challenge. They also found the power-up items to be \\"nothing new\\" and disliked its gameplay for being tedious and uninteresting. Power Play soured towards the gameplay for not adding anything particularly new to the genre, saying that it only stuck to the bare basic mechanics established in previous vertically scrolling shooters.

Versions for the Commodore 64 (with Richard Darling) and the Atari 8-bit computers (with Adrian Sheppard) and an enhanced 128K Spectrum version with music and additional graphics were all released in 1986. It is the second game in the Magic Knight series and was published by Mastertronic as part of their Mastertronic Added Dimension label. Plot Magic Knight is transported to a castle with a collection of other characters and must rescue his friend Gimbal the wizard. Gimbal has become trapped by a self-inflicted \\"white-out\\" spell whilst trying to create a better-tasting rice pudding. Magic Knight must rescue Gimbal from his self- inflicted imprisonment and then ensure both she and the castle's other inhabitants are all returned to their correct time and place. Gameplay Unlike the previous game in the series, Finders Keepers, the game is less action-oriented and more of a graphic adventure although it still contains some platform game elements. The player controls Magic Knight as he wanders around the castle. As well as the player character, the cast also contains various other characters who have found themselves there. Like Magic Knight, these characters move around (albeit off-screen, they are always static when on-screen) and can fall asleep and grow hungry. Magic Knight needs to look after and \\"maintain\\" these other characters (as well as himself) and this adds a further strategic element to gameplay. Magic Knight interacts with his environment and other characters using a drop-down window system called \\"Windimation\\", which is full of commands such as \\"take object\\" and \\"talk to character\\". Because of this, much of the gameplay is quite similar to later graphic adventures such as The Secret of Monkey Island. Most of the game's puzzles are solved by using objects in the correct place or giving objects to the correct character and then having them assist the player. Another method of solving problems is to use Magic Knight's spellcasting abilities. Most of his spells require him to have collected certain objects first. The castle itself consists of several floors (including a roof garden and a basement) that can be accessed via a lift. Some of these areas are only fully accessible once some puzzles are solved. Magic Knight only has a certain amount of energy and if he runs out of this he dies and it is game over. His energy is depleted both by moving between rooms and when dangerous objects such as bouncing balls hit him. Finding a way of topping up Magic Knight's energy is one of the first puzzles the player must solve. There are also a few rooms that cause Magic Knight to die just by entering them. These can be passed by solving puzzles. The game is also played against a time limit: there are only 48 hours of in- game time until Gimbal is destroyed by his spell and Magic Knight and the other characters are trapped in the castle forever. Sequels There were further two Magic Knight games released. These are Knight Tyme (1986) and Stormbringer (1987). Both of these games have similar gameplay to Spellbound. Crime Busters A game with striking similarities to Spellbound, called Crime Busters, was released in 1986 but featured a detective in a mansion. This game was withdrawn following a demand for a written apology from the author of Crime Busters (Harry S Price) and the threat of legal action by Mastertronic. Mastertronic claimed that the code was so similar that the anti- hacker protection they had written into Spellbound was largely unchanged. The protection relies on the fact that the Spectrum holds numbers in BASIC programs twice in memory, one (ASCII) copy for displaying on screen and one (binary, tagged as unlistable by a CHR$14 character copy for executing. These are usually the same but by directly amending the appropriate memory address they can be made to differ. This is used by Spellbound as a rudimentary form of protection; after loading the game, the copy for execution jumps to the proper start point, but the copy for display shows a different address pointing to a routine which displays a greeting to the hacker (\\"HELLO HACKER / FANCY MEETING YOU HERE !\\") and resets the computer when a key is pressed, thus making the proper start address more difficult to find. This message was changed in Crime Busters to read \\"NAUGHTY NAUGHTY NAUGHTY,NICE TRY! / !\\" but the BASIC loader does not have the same protection so there is no way of executing this code without prior knowledge of its existence in Spellbound. The routine was later amended in the 128K version of Spellbound to show multiple screens of text and to play the game's music in the background; the messages are as follows: As with Crime Busters, there is no reference to the start point of this routine so prior knowledge of it is required in order to see it.

He is popularly known in the Mandopop scene as the \\"Prince of Love Songs\\" (情歌王子). Wong began his singing career in a duo with Victor Wong. The pair had attained notable success in Taiwan, but in a mutual agreement, the two split in 2000. Wong has released five solo albums since then, the third one being his breakthrough album, Fairy Tale. He has achieved a great success in Taiwan, mainland China, Hong Kong and Malaysia where he is based. Wong has also helped several other successful singers by composing songs for them, including the ballad \\"Courage\\" (勇氣), which was originally sung by Fish Leong.  Biography  Born in Ipoh, Malaysia to a Hakka family, he is the elder of one children. He has a younger sister. Wong, as a devoted Catholic, often sang in the church choir during his school days and was once a choir teacher at a church. Graduating from Sam Tet School in Ipoh, Wong often participated in musical performances in school and has been writing his own songs since secondary school. After he moved to Kuala Lumpur to pursue a course in computer engineering, his interest in the world of music and music composition began to grow. = Duo with Victor Wong = Entering from up to 30 singing competitions in town in a single year, where he managed to surface as the winner several times, were also the stepping stones to his successful singing career today. Finally noticed by Asia Pacific Music in the Pioneer karaoke contest, he started to learn Audio Engineering at Ocean Institute Of Audio Engineering during his contract with Asia Pacific Music as a recording artist. After his graduation, Michael produced his first album with two other college mates, Chan and Tan. With the joining of Victor Wong as a singer during that period, they submitted the album, with the theme song written by Michael, \\"掌心“ (The Palm) to Rock Records, which in turn, signed them up almost immediately. They then formed a duo group more commonly known in Malaysia as Michael & Victor or Guang Liang Pin Guan (光良品冠). In Taiwan and China, they were mostly known as Wu Yin Liang Pin (無印良品), a name given by their record label in Taiwan. = The split = The duo then arguably became the first Malaysians to attain much success in the music scene in Taiwan. Their albums managed to hit the top notch both locally and in Taiwan as their debut album went platinum in both Malaysia and Taiwan. After a few splendid and successful years together as a duo in the Chinese music scene, during which the pair secured countless awards for their success, Michael and Victor then decided it was time to part cordially and go their own ways in the music scene as solo singers in year 2000. = Solo career = Not long after the announcement, Wong worked hard to compose and write new songs for his new solo album, Michael's First Album (第一次個人創作專輯; Dì Yī Cì Gè Rén Chuàng Zuò Zhuān Jí), which performed above expectation. Although Wong's company promptly decided that he should produce his first solo album on his own, he did not agree straight away. This is because he was not confident that he was skilful enough to produce one whole album all by himself. However, after much contemplating, Wong finally accepted the challenge and was successful in breaking away from the Michael & Victor mould. Other than working on his own album, Wong also found time to co-produce other singers' albums like Rene Liu and Fish Leong. Wong released his second album, Ray of Light (光芒; Guāng Máng), in November 2002. It then became the number one album, in sales, in Taiwan. = Fairy Tale = After releasing two solo albums on his own, Wong's fans had to wait another two years before he finally launched his much-anticipated album, Fairy Tale (Tong Hua). The first single from this album, \\"Fairy Tale\\", Wong wrote and composed by himself. Wong, who is more of a composer and hardly wrote lyrics, asked about 30 lyricists for suggestions for this particular song. After finally adding a finishing touch to the song with lyrics he wrote himself, he then left it to be arranged and produced by the experienced Japanese producer Taichi Nakamura (producer). After rejecting the first few songs he short-listed himself for the album with his sense of perfection, Wong eventually re-selected some songs himself and finally rooted for his ten favourite songs to be cut into the album, of which six were co-written by himself. His two years of hard work finally paid off when this album immediately attained success; it is critically acclaimed to be Wong's best- selling album yet. \\"Fairy Tale\\" has proven to be his strongest single yet by shooting up to No. 1 immediately after it was released in January 2005, making it to the top of the download counter Baidu 500 for 15 weeks as Asia was swept by the \\"Fairy Tale Tornado\\". The single is arguably the most successful Chinese language song of the 21st century. As of 2012 it is still among the top in the karaoke charts. = New contracts = Michael Wong's contract with Rock Records ended on 31 December 2004, but he decided to continue to promote for the album Fairy Tale, released in January 2005. After the promotion period finished, Wong has made the biggest decision in his singing career by announcing his departure from his longtime recording company, Rock Records, in July 2005. After 10 years being contracted with Rock Records, Wong is now officially signed to Amusic. The reason of his departure from Rock Records was because Rock Records believed that since his music was so simple, it was not music. Thus, they ignored him. On TV, someone had claimed that Wong's music was not music due to its simplicity, causing the singer grief. Wong's unstable relationship with Rock Records has encouraged his decision to leave for Amusic. When pressed for comments, Wong firmly and merely stated that he thanked Rock Records for giving him his big break. = Acting career = His talents and works in the music world aside, Wong also happens to be a worthy actor. Acting alongside Taiwanese singer Richie Ren, fellow Malaysian singer, Ah Niu and famous Cantonese singer/actress, Sammi Cheng, Wong made his debut in the big screen in movie Summer Holiday in year 2000. Next to that, Wong also acted in several TV drama series in Taiwan, such as White Romance (starring alongside Karena Lam), Wintry Night 2 where he speaks his native dialect Hakka, and several more. Besides that, Wong also did a stunning act in Taiwanese director Su Chaopin's debut comedy movie, BTS. Besides movies and drama series, Wong also starred in a musical stage drama in Taiwan, Mr. Wing, in August 2005. = Commitment = He has released his new fourth album, entitled 《約定》(Yue Ding / Commitment), which sold 1.5 million copies in less than one month. This is a best collection of many of his past works. There would be a total of approximately 17 tracks on this album. Three self-penned new songs are featured in this new album, which are titled 《約定》(\\"Commitment\\"), 《都是你》(Dou Shi Ni / \\"It's You\\") and 《擁抱我》(Yong Bao Wo / \\"Embrace Me\\"). The rest of the album will be filled with songs which he wrote for other singers like 《勇氣》[(Yong Qi / \\"Courage\\")-original singer: Fish Leong)], 《我等你》[(Wo Deng Ni / \\"I'm Waiting For You\\")-original singer: Rene Liu)] and 《戀》[(Lian / \\"Love\\")-original singer: Angelica Lee)]. He also included the songs he wrote and sang when he was still part of the duo Michael and Victor. Owing to the overwhelming success of \\"Tong Hua\\", some critics have expressed their concerns that \\"Tong Hua\\" might only be Wong's one-hit-wonder. His critics were proven wrong as the sales of his fourth album, Yue Ding, exceeded expectations by selling more than a million copies worldwide in a month's time. Wong's fanbase has grown tremendously and has gained much popularity globally. His success as a singer and songwriter has earned him countless awards from Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and Malaysia. = Further success = Wong's participation in A Music records label in Hong Kong has gained him more recognition in Asia. He appeared as a guest at the concert of famous Cantonese singer Leon Lai in October 2005. On 6 June 2006, Wong made it into the Malaysia Book of Records as the Malaysian Chinese Male Composer with the highest number of awards and also for the Best Selling Chinese Album (Tong Hua). Wong has gathered 44 awards, 23 of them for his hit song \\"Tong Hua\\". Wong has also managed to make it to the nominees' list of the 17th Golden Melody Awards, Taiwan's equivalent of the Grammys. Wong was holding up against fellow Taiwan-based Malaysian singer Penny Tai and other musical talents like Hu Defu, Chen Xiaoxia, and Yu Yang in the Best Composer Category. Although the award went to fellow Malaysian singer Penny Tai, Wong expresses that he feels very grateful and lucky to be nominated in this prestigious award ceremony. = Commitment: Fulfilled = In the past, Wong always felt puzzled and uncertain whenever his fans urged him with the question, \\"When are you finally having a concert?\\" Due to circumstances in the past, Wong had never held his own solo concert before and always tried to soothe his fans by making promises to them that he will, one day, finally stage his own solo concert some time soon. And therefore, in year 2006, he finally got the chance to fulfill the commitment between him and his fans. With just half a year in the Hong Kong music scene, Wong, who gained more recognition in Hong Kong, was given a golden opportunity to stage his own solo concert. Not only that it was his first time, but it was also to be held in the famous Hong Kong Coliseum where almost every Chinese singer dreams to stage their own concert. Apparently, he is the first Malaysian singer to do so. Although he was worried about the turn up that night, Wong's anxiety was unfounded because his concert tickets were sold out after only being available for purchase for 5 days. Wong was deeply surprised and delighted and thanked his fans greatly for their utmost support to his music. Wong completed his much-anticipated first solo concert in the Hong Kong Coliseum on 29 March, and the success of the whole concert was undeniable. His concert was entitled \\"Michael's First Fairy Tale Concert 2006\\". Wong has managed to make his mark in everybody's heart with his love for music. After that, he would return to his homeland, Malaysia, in September, to stage a concert there as well. His second concert, titled \\"Michael's Commitment Concert Malaysia 2006\\", was held on 1 September in the Putra Indoor Stadium in Malaysia. After about a few weeks of selling tickets, all were sold out. Due to the overwhelming response, Wong and his company decided to stage his concert there for two nights. Wong was very delighted and grateful that his fans were so supportive and stated that he hoped these two concerts would allow him to introduce his country, Malaysia, to his fans from other countries, playing the role as Tourism Malaysia's envoy. His two shows in Malaysia guaranteed a fun-filled night where fans enjoyed Wong's soothing, self-written songs. Wong released a compilation called Michael 1996–2006 the greatest hits on 16 May 2007. On 9 November 2007, Wong released his 5th solo studio album, Never Apart. 31 July 2009 he released his First Digital Single which contained 2 Cantonese songs called: 店小二 (Dian Xiao Er) and 清水 (Qing Shui). 右手邊 (You Shou Bian) and 美好時光 (Mei Hao Shi Guang) were also included. In October 2010, Wong represented Malaysia and performed at the 7th Asia Song Festival, organised by Korea Foundation for International Culture Exchange, at the Seoul Olympic Stadium.KOFICE 7th Asia Song Festival 23 October 2010. Retrieved 12 October 2011 On Christmas Eve 2012, he and Teresa Carpio sang at The Joint in Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas as a Christmas special and sang a song that was not recorded in any of his albums. = Tourism = In 2019, Wong was appointed tourism ambassador for Perak by Tourism Malaysia.

Life and career Verner was born at Sheridan, Ontario, which was then called Hammondsville, in Upper Canada. As a boy, he was fascinated and inspired by the paintings of Paul Kane and tried to convince this established painter to take him on as a pupil, but was turned away. A few years later, he went to London, where he studied at the Heatherley School of Fine Art from 1856 to 1860, before joining the British army, enlisting in the 3rd West York regiment. He returned to Toronto in 1862, where he worked first as a photograph colorist and then as a photographer. He painted portraits of Indians from photographs. Verner's work is, like Kane's, also focused on scenes from the Canadian west and also sometimes based on field sketches, although Verner didn't travel as extensively as Kane. Many of his paintings are based on sketches made when he accompanied the Lieutenant- Governor of Manitoba, Alexander Morris, to the signing of the third Northwest Angle Treaty at Lake of the Woods in 1873. He used these sketches the rest of his life as the basis for paintings, painting Indians as model images of domesticity or as figures in his landscapes. He also carefully studied the buffalo and used his sketches as the basis for pictures, although he may never have seen one in the wild. In 1880, Verner moved permanently to London but continued to visit Canada sporadically, and he had frequent exhibitions of his paintings in Toronto, Montreal, and London, England. He was one of the founding members on the Ontario Society of Artists in 1880. In 1893, he became an Associate Member of the Royal Canadian Academy. In 1901, he won a gold medal at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo. He was elected the first Canadian member of the Royal British Colonial Society of Artists in 1905. Verner's work can be found in many collections, including the National Gallery of Canada, the Robert McLaughlin Gallery in Oshawa, and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound, Ontario. He was the uncle of Canadian magician Dai Vernon (1894–1992).

Because golf balls have a dimpled surface to improve their aerodynamic properties, increasing both distance and control, and are used primarily on grassy surfaces, they tend to collect dirt and grass easily, which can adversely affect their aerodynamic characteristics. Ball washers are typically found on golf courses; on some courses, there is one at every hole. To maintain these aerodynamic properties balls are usually inspected for dirt before play, and washed if required. Ball washers can be operated either manually or electronically. Ball washers for cleaning individual balls consist of a cylindrical housing, in which the ball to be cleaned is inserted. The cleaning of the ball takes place via circulating brushes. For cleaning a larger number of golf balls, machines are used which suck up the balls like a vacuum cleaner, wash them (usually some sort of detergent is used), and put them in a separate net afterward.

(The music is loosely based on Felix Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in E Flat Minor Opus 64 Second Movement). In spite of its German-American origins, it is widely mistaken to be an Irish ballad. Westendorf, born in Virginia of German parents, was then teaching at the reform school known as the Indiana House of Refuge for Juvenile Offenders in Hendricks County, Indiana. He wrote it for his wife (who was, however, named Jennie), who had made a visit to her home state of New York due to homesickness. It's in the form of an \\"answer\\" to a popular ballad of the time, \\"Barney, Take Me Home Again,\\" composed by Westendorf’s close friend, George W.

Actual Bluntman and Chronic comic books based on the fictional movie comic book series were published after the release of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. Both the movies and the comic books were created by writer and actor Kevin Smith.BLUNTMAN AND CHRONIC TRADE PAPERBACK http://majorspoilers.com/2014/07/10/sdcc14-new-bluntman-chronic-minimates-way/ Famed comics creator Mike Allred designed the costumes for the characters. Movies In the film Chasing Amy, Banky Edwards (played by Jason Lee) and Holden McNeil (played by Ben Affleck) create a comic book series based on their infamous stoner friends, Jay and Silent Bob. The first three issues of the series sell out quickly. At one point, MTV offers Banky and Holden McNeil the option to make an animated series. Banky is willing to do it, but Holden McNeil declines for \\"artistic reasons\\". Soon after this, Holden passes the reins of power over the comic to Banky, and their partnership is disbanded. In the film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Banky Edwards has sold the rights to Bluntman and Chronic to Miramax who begins production of a film adaptation of the comic due to the recent success of X-Men. Miramax's production is directed by Chaka Luther King (played by Chris Rock) and stars Jason Biggs as Bluntman (referred to as the pie fucker throughout the film), James Van Der Beek as Chronic, and Mark Hamill as the villain Cock-Knocker. However, filming is interrupted by the comic's inspirations, Jay and Silent Bob, who arrive hoping to stop the film, as they worry that it will damage their reputation (after having been upset by comments made by Internet trolls on a movie gossip website about the film and the characters). Mistaken as Biggs' and Van Der Beek's stand-ins at one point, Jay and Silent Bob are filmed in some of the scenes. Months later, the movie is released. One character in the film, Hooper X, referred to the movie as \\"a ninety-minute long gay joke,\\" and felt it was \\"just like watching Batman & Robin all over again.\\" Jay and Silent Bob then use their royalties to track down and beat up everyone who bashed them on the internet. In an extended scene in Clerks II, Dante Hicks and Randal Graves were wondering where Jay and Silent Bob got the money to loan them to reopen the Quick Stop, and Jay asks \\"Doesn't anybody remember they made a movie using our likeness?\\"---referencing the Bluntman and Chronic movie made in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. Bluntman and Chronic also appear in the 2013 animated comedy Jay & Silent Bob's Super Groovy Cartoon Movie. Comics =Trade paperback= A comic book based on the fictional movie was published in trade paperback form by Oni Press in 2001. The book is portrayed as a collection of the three issues written by Banky Edwards and Holden McNeil in Chasing Amy. It was written by Kevin Smith with art by Michael Avon Oeming and Neil Vokes. In the first issue, after encountering several comic book references, Jay and Silent Bob win the lottery and decide to become superheroes. After Bob handles most of the gadget work, the two don the names Bluntman and Chronic. In the second issue, some of the nemeses of Bluntman and Chronic, such as Cock- Knocker and Dickhead, reveal their origins to fellow supervillain inmates and a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist turns out to be the Lipstick Lesbian, a newer supervillain, who helps the criminals escape. The five villains, consisting of the aforementioned three along with the Diddler and Newsgroup, form The League of Shitters. In the third and final issue, Chronic nearly throws out his costume, feeling that he's become \\"the sidekick\\". He changes his mind, however, when he realizes Bluntman \\"has all the weed\\". Meanwhile, the League of Shitters discover that the Doobage Duo's Bluntcave lies beneath the RST Video/Quick Stop. The five arrive at the stores, only to have Cock-Knocker go into the Quick Stop and buy some snacks. The four others, however, are crushed to death after RST's front wall falls over, allowing Bluntman and Chronic to ride the Bluntmobile into the Bluntcave. Cock-Knocker then exits the Quick Stop, only to step in Dickhead's spleen. Cock-Knocker breaks into the Bluntcave, where he slices Chronic in half with a Bluntsaber. Bluntman slays Cock-Knocker and weeps over his dead friend. The cover of issue three features Bluntman holding Chronic's corpse the same way Batman held Jason Todd's in A Death in the Family. =Other comics= Two other Bluntman and Chronic comics were published, both with art by comic book artist and Madman creator Mike Allred. The first was seen in the opening titles of Chasing Amy and was published in the Clerks/Chasing Amy screenplay book. The second was published in Oni Double Feature #12. Both have a design style that is very different from that which is seen in the trade paperback. Their style echoes the comics of the 1940s and is visually more similar to the comics seen in Chasing Amy.

He was the managing director of Paul and Linda McCartney's MPL Communications, and then of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Theatre Company. He was a co-founder of the radio stations Jazz FM and Classic FM. Brolly was born in London. His father, Tom Brolly, was born in Belfast but played football for Millwall FC and Crystal Palace FC, and played four times for Northern Ireland. Brolly was educated at St Dunstan's College, and did National Service in the Royal Ulster Rifles. He played rugby for London Irish, and worked in television from the 1957. He became a vice-president of MCA Television at the age of 26. He married his wife, Gillian, in 1963. He worked on the production of films including A Countess from Hong Kong (1967) — Charlie Chaplin's last film — and the BBC television drama series Colditz (1972–74). In 1969, Brolly encouraged Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice to develop their musical Jesus Christ Superstar (1972–80). Given the controversial topic, he encouraged them to release an album of the music first. The double album proved to be a great success, as was the musical when it opened on Broadway in 1971. He assisted Paul and Linda McCartney setting up MPL Communications in 1973, becoming its managing director. He also assisted them with the management of Wings, and produced records including Band on the Run and Mull of Kintyre. He left MPL Communications in 1978 to become managing director of Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group. He also took a 30% interest in the company. At RUG, he developed the West End musicals Cats (1981–2002), Starlight Express (1984–92) and The Phantom of the Opera (1986–present, ), all of which have had extended runs on Broadway and elsewhere. He sold half of his interest when RUG was floated on the stock exchange in 1986. He left in 1988, by which time RUG was producing books, television and films. Brolly took an £800,000 payoff and received £14 million from Robert Maxwell for his remaining 14% stake. In addition to continuing to produce hit shows, such as The Importance of Being Earnest with Simon Callow, Brolly went on to start Jazz FM in 1990 and Classic FM in 1992, the latter in collaboration with GWR Group. He was also involved with the US leisure concept company LARC Inc, which designs theme parks such as Alton Towers. He set up a theatrical production firm called Producers Four with fellow entertainment mogul Michael Jenkins. In 2004, Producers Four launched the Broadway musical Brooklyn. He also invested in the Angelina Ballerina children's books and in Tim Waterstone's Daisy & Tom children's shops. He died of a heart attack on 28 October 2006. He was survived by his wife and their two sons.

She was a member of the Sarabhai industrialist family of Ahmedabad. Early life Mridula was born in Ahmedabad, India to an affluent business family. She was one of eight children of Ambalal Sarabhai and Sarla Devi, and a sister of Vikram Sarabhai. She was home-schooled by a succession of British and Indian teachers under the supervision of her parents. In 1928, she was enrolled for college education at Gujarat Vidyapeeth but dropped out the following year, ostensibly in order to participate in the Salt Satyagraha. At a young age, she heeded Gandhi's call to boycott foreign goods and institutions, and is said to have refused for this reason to go abroad to study. Congresswoman and Freedom fighter At an early age, Mridula came under the influence of Mahatma Gandhi. As a child of ten, she worked with the Vanara Sena (\\"Monkey Army\\" - a group of child activists organised by Indira Gandhi) of the Congress and carried messages and water for the satyagrahis. Influenced by Jawaharlal Nehru, who was to become her lifelong friend and mentor, she helped with the organization of the Youth Conference in Rajkot in 1927. She joined the Congress Seva Dal during the Salt Satyagraha and organized the boycott of foreign cloth and British goods. She was even imprisoned by British for her role in salt satyagraha.Mahatma Gandhi: Salt satyagraha: the watershed by Navjivan Publications, 1995:pp 263-On 9 April in Ahmedabad Khurshedbehn Naoroji and Mridula Sarabhai were arrested for selling contraband salt. In 1934, she was elected to the All India Congress Committee as a delegate from Gujarat. However, in subsequent years her independent stances caused friction with other leaders from the state. When the party refused to nominate her, she contested as an independent and won with the largest margin of votes. She played a significant role in the organizational machinery of the Congress, heading its women's wing. She was appointed the Secretary, Sub Committee on Women's Role in the Planned Economy for the National Planning Board. The report was later used by early legislators during the drafting of the Constitution and the first few budgets. In 1946, Pandit Nehru appointed her as one of the General Secretaries of the Congress party and a member of the Congress Working Committee. She resigned and followed Gandhiji to Noakhali when riots broke out. During the turbulent year of Partition of India, she took active lead in restoring communal amity and harmony, firstly at Patna, where she was attending the flag hoisting ceremony on 15 August 1947, with permission from Gandhiji. When she heard of riots being broken in Punjab, she immediately contacted Nehru and later rushed there to take active role in peace keeping.Rebel With A Cause Her role in preserving communal harmony during the violence of partition was praised by leaders from India and Pakistan. However, some years after independence of India, she became disillusioned with Congress. In later years, she became an ardent and vocal supporter of Sheikh Abdullah outside Kashmir, her long-time friend. She even funded his expenses for fighting Kashmir Conspiracy Case, for which Abdullah was imprisoned.he Sheikh's expenses were met by his woman friend, Mridulla Sarabai, who was the daughter of the owner of the Bombay- based famous industry \\"Sarabai Chemicals\\". Later, even she, herself, was imprisoned several months without trial over the Kashmir case, although, she was never charged of conspiracy.

History Bina Swadaya was founded by the Ikatan Petani Pancasila (Pancasila Farmers Association) on May 24, 1967. It was initially named the Yayasan Sosial Tani Membangun (Peasant Socio-economic Development Foundation). The establishment of Bina Swadaya was thereby related to the existence of Gerakan Sosial Pancasila (Pancasila Social Movement) made up of laborers, farmers, fishermen, paramedics, and entrepreneurs. The goal of the Pancasila Social Movement was to empower the community in accordance with the Pancasila ideals of independence of the Republic of Indonesia. As an independence and community empowerment vehicle, Bina Swadaya aims to work within the context of existing challenges. For its optimum performance and impact, the organization and approach of Bina Swadaya aids to undertake work which is suitable in the local social, economic and political environment. *Social Movement Era (1954–1973). Particularly during the period of Old Order Regime, Bina Swadaya was a mass organization, characterized with activities mainstreaming the empowerment of the community in political decision. *Socio- Economic Development Institution Era (1974–1998). During the period of New Order Regime, Bina Swadaya particularly appeared as a socio-economic development institution. Bina Swadaya was a managed social laboratory and its leason learned being used to cooperate with Government as well as other non governmental organizations for wider impact. *Social Entrepreneurship Era (1999 - now). Following the marked movement toward democratization and decentralization in Indonesia beginning in 1999, Bina Swadaya transformed into a social entrepreneurship developing self-supporting community empowerment organization. Foot prints In performing the mission, Bina Swadaya has conducted many programs in cooperation with various stakeholders who care for the poor: * Developing 650,00 community-based groups for income generating activities (UPPKS) in collaboration with BKBN. * Developing 120,00 Self-Help Groups (SHGs) in collaboration with National Development Planning Board (Bappenas) and the Ministry of Home Affairs, Republic of Indonesia. * Developing 60,000 marginal fisherman groups in collaboration with Ministry of Agriculture. * Developing Program for Linking Bank and Self-Help Group (PHBK) in collaboration with Bank Indonesia, BRI, and GTZ. * Developing Program of Social Forestry in collaboration with Perum Perhutani and the Ford Foundation. * Developing Integrated Irrigation Program in collaboration with Ministry of Public Works. Activities To reach its vision and to carry out its missions Bina Swadaya diverts its activities into seven categories as follows: * Community Empowerment. In the form of regional development activities, Public Health, Sanitation, Environment, Farming, and Labor by way of: research, training, consultation, and facilitation. (Educational and Training Center, Center of Studies, Consultancy and Branch Office) * Micro Finance Development. Micro Finance Services is carried out through Banking Financial Institution and Non-Banking institution; reaching the poor and the marginalized. (Bina Arta Swadaya, Rural Banks, Micro Finance Institution) * Agribusiness Development. By way of product marketing activities and farm production facilities, developing farm shop toward franchise system (Trubus Mitra Swadaya). * Development Communication. Supply information to different field of development area through publishing magazine, book, radio and TV program, VCD. (Trubus Swadaya, Penebar Swadaya, Puspa Swara, Trubus Media Swadaya and Niaga Swadaya). * Alternative Tourism Development. Organize Tour Program orientated to education, environment, culture and development (Bina Swadaya Tours). * Printing Service. Managing printing industry to support development communication activities and increase institutional income. (Penebar Swadaya Printing House) * Wisma Hijau Training Centre. Provide facilities for meeting, training, workshop and seminar. (Wisma Hijau – Kampus Diklat Bina Swadaya)  Viewpoint  Bina Swadaya views the problem of poverty in a slightly different light. Instead of coming up with solutions by itself, the foundation considers the poor as subjects rather than objects of anti-poverty programs.Ismawan, Bambang. 2003. \\"Partisipasi dan Dimensi Keswadayaan: Pengalaman LSM Membangun Keswadayaan Masyarakat\\", Jurnal Ekonomi Rakyat, Tahun II - No. 3. Since the poor in this region are viewed as ‘the have little’ type, Bina Swadaya believes that by organizing their resources and developing in a collective way to form a self-reliant group, the poor themselves will be able to come up with their own solutions to their own problems which at the same time gives them a sense of achievement and making them independent in the process.Ismawan, Bambang. 2003. \\"Partisipasi dan Dimensi Keswadayaan: Pengalaman LSM Membangun Keswadayaan Masyarakat\\", Jurnal Ekonomi Rakyat, Tahun II - No. 3. As Bambang Ismawan who is the founder and director of Bina Swadaya says, \\"We do not offer a solution. We only listen to the people and help them find the best solution. It is really something to see their faces light up when they find a solution to their problems,\\".The Jakarta Post, 3 January 2007  Approach & Efforts  Bina Swadaya has chosen micro finance as a tool to empower the poor in Indonesia.Suharko. 2007. The Roles of NGOs in Rural Poverty Reduction:The Case of Indonesia and India. Discussion Paper No.160.GSID-Nagoya University. According to the foundation, Self-Help Groups (SHG) forms the foundation for micro finance development. It is because these groups teach them how to be self-reliant and how to conduct savings and credit activities which is essential for the poor in time to come when they begin their own micro businesses.Suharko. 2007. The Roles of NGOs in Rural Poverty Reduction:The Case of Indonesia and India. Discussion Paper No.160.GSID-Nagoya University. An example of such a SHG would be Arta Mekar Mulya Group which is located in Sidamulya village, the District of Subang, the Province of West Java where 91.5% of the village population are peasants where the majority of the land owners possess less than 0.5 hectares.Suharko. 2007. The Roles of NGOs in Rural Poverty Reduction:The Case of Indonesia and India. Discussion Paper No.160.GSID-Nagoya University. The first successful project of Bina Swadaya in Sidamulya village was the pump irrigation project that was started in 1985.Suharko.2007. The Roles of NGOs in Rural Poverty Reduction:The Case of Indonesia and India. Discussion Paper No.160.GSID-Nagoya University Its main objective was to increase the productivity of uncultivated wet rice fields and it was achieved when the rice production increased from three tons to eight tons per hectare.Suharko. 2007. The Roles of NGOs in Rural Poverty Reduction:The Case of Indonesia and India. Discussion Paper No.160.GSID-Nagoya University Since the sustainability of the pump irrigation project was a problem due to high operational costs, Bina Swadaya changed its approach in 1994. Its new objectives were to strengthen the existing SHGs and to increase the availability of the micro finance scheme to the villagers.Suharko. 2007. The Roles of NGOs in Rural Poverty Reduction:The Case of Indonesia and India. Discussion Paper No.160.GSID-Nagoya University. And a rural bank, BPR Abdiarta Swadaya was established by Bina Swadaya as a course of action to achieve its new objectives. The majority members of Arta Mekar Mulya Group who were micro entrepreneurs and peasants now could borrow up to Rp. 400.000 without any form of physical collateral allowing them to expand their micro businesses or further improving their rice farming which will aid in increasing the productivity as well.Suharko. 2007. The Roles of NGOs in Rural Poverty Reduction:The Case of Indonesia and India. Discussion Paper No.160.GSID-Nagoya University. The success of the SHG attracted villagers from other villages to become members of Arta Mekar Mulya Group and this greatly freed many villagers from heavy debts as now instead of borrowing from money lenders who charged exorbitant rates of interest, they can seek financial help from Arta Mekar Mulya Group. Another attribute of this SHG is that instead of only focusing on the well-being of its group members, the profits which were the fruits of their success were channeled to address other social needs of the village as well which resulted in shops, bridges and the establishment of other community infrastructures.Suharko.2007.

These unions seek to organize the employed, unemployed, and underemployed. They press for change in the workplace and beyond, organizing around issues such as welfare reform, health care, jobs, housing, and immigration. Individual issues at work are seen as being a part of broader societal problems which they seek to address. Unlike trade unions, community union membership is not based on the workplace- it is based on common identities and issues. Alliances forged between unions and other groups may have a primary identity based on affiliations of religion, ethnic group, gender, disability, environmentalism, neighborhood residence, or sexuality. Community unionism has many definitions and practices. It varies according to country, institutional and political contexts, internal organization, leadership, scale, organizing style, sources of funding, and communication structure. In all, there is no \\"universal\\" community union; they take on many different forms. In order to simplify the complex structures of community unions, 4 categories have been established (although in practice community unions may blur the boundaries of these classifications): * Community organization/ no union partner: This consists of community based efforts to organize around workplaces. It may also include new initiatives created by already established community organizations. * Labour union(s)/ no community partner: This category is composed of new union locals or new initiatives undertaken as part of a labour union organizing strategy. These organizations seek the support of community institutions but do not form a joint effort with them. * Community/labour partnership but with community organization dominant: This organization is based on mutual self-interest. Unions and community work together to improve conditions in the labour market through economic and political action. In these partnerships, community leadership dominates the practice of the organization. * Community/labour partnership but with labour union dominant: This organization differs from the one previously mentioned in that union leadership dominates the practice of the organization. A part of the discourse of why community unionism has many definitions is in the ambiguity of the word \\"community\\" itself. In \\"Coalitions and Community Unionism\\", Tattersall breaks the word \\"community\\" into three elements which may help in understanding community unions better: as organizations, common interest and identity, and place.  Goals of community unions  Community union initiatives aim to achieve a number of things: * Seek to build community power.Cranford, Cynthis J., Ladd, Deena.(2003). Community Unionism:Organizing For Fair Employment In Canada.Just Labour,3,46-59. * By increasing scale of organizing activity, they can deal with questions of economic justice beyond particular work places. * By working with community groups, unions are able to reach workers in traditionally non-union environments. * They can enable unions to help organize fragmented workforces split across large numbers of small workplaces. * Establishing extensive links into the local community may help unions defend terms and conditions within their traditional workplaces.  History of community unionism  In Community Unionism A Comparative Analysis of Concepts and contexts, McBride and Greenwood note that community unions are not a new idea: it is an old form of unionism that dates back 150 years. They point out that in the early period of trade union formation, UK unions were organized within local communities where factories and heavy industry were geographically established. They find that this community/union relationship was broken with the changing geographies of employment and industrial restructuring. With this change, stable communities were destroyed that were located around the docks, mines, mills, and other regions of heavy industry. Supporting this idea, Hess also agrees that community factors have always been a part of unionism in \\"Community as a Factor in Union Organization\\". Black establishes that the term “community unionism” was first used in the 1960s in his article “Community Unionism: A Strategy for Organizing in the New Economy”. He states that James O’Connar used the term in 1964: he believed that in the future, communities would become central to working class organization because of the instability of workplaces. Jones envisioned that future employment would be deskilled and insecure, and because of this, the workplace would no longer be appropriate for organization. He anticipated that community unions would be established in de-industrialized towns, and urban slums. He also believed that community unions would work to improve housing, welfare, and public services. As well, Black points out that the notion of community unionism was also used by organizers within the United Auto Workers (UAW) labour union in the 1960s. An organizer by the name of Jack Conway envisioned a new form of unionism that would develop. Conway too, believed that “community” would take over the central role of the factory in organizing workers in trade unionism. He came to believe this by looking at the Farm Workers Union (FWU). He noticed that the issues that farmers were facing went beyond the workplace. Conway concluded that the new form of unions would focus on grievances, political education, and community organization. In \\"Community Unions in Canada and Labor’s (Re)Organization of Space\\", Tufts also explains how a labour leader of the UAW, Walter Reuther, envisioned a new form of unionism. Reuther believed that the labour movement should be more of a “social movement” as opposed to solely an “economic movement”. Tattersall points out in her article \\"Coalitions and Community Unionism:Using the Term Community to Explore Effective Union-Community Collaborations\\", that \\"community unions\\" were also created by the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) in the United States in the 1960s. These community unions were community based, worker organizations. Tattersall also notes that along with the UAW, the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s also used the term \\"community unionism\\". Here, the term was used to describe community organizations that sought to organize the urban working poor in the United States. Although the notion of community unionism was being put into practice in certain areas, it was not widely accepted by majority of people, and business unionism dominated. It was not until the 1990s that the practice of community unions increased.  The rise of community unions  The 1970s and 1980s witnessed profound restructuring of labour markets. Neoliberal policies that emerged in the 1970s were adopted by many governments around the world, and included measures such as deregulation and privatization. These policies created insecurity in employment by breaking down institutional regulatory and political support for unions. Traditional unions experienced a loss of power, influence, and members. During this period of economic restructuring, communities were forced to form coalitions with the labour movement to fight factory closures and relocations that were the basis of many local economies. Community unionism can be understood as a response to neoliberalism and globalization: it was a turn back to the local level- or community- in organizing. It seeks to organize some of the most vulnerable people- immigrants, women, and people of colour- who have been disproportionately affected by the growth of exploitative working conditions in the neoliberal economy.  Community unions in Japan  Community unions were formed in Japan in the early 1980s. They emerged spontaneously from grassroots organizations and from labour councils (although labour councils account for a larger number of organizing activities). Labour councils that supported community unions were affiliated with Sohyo: a left leaning union confederation. These labour councils were in charge of different regions and directly represented workers by forming community unions. Labour councils held relative autonomy from the larger national confederation. They were able to achieve this because they maintained their own finances and staff. Thus, community unions were dependent on labour councils for resources that supported these organizations. Because workers with part-time employment were excluded from union membership at those firms, labour councils sought to represent people with part-time employment and people who worked in small firms in a given region. Councils found these workers through “labour problem hotlines”. Because of their independence from the larger confederation, organizing activities varied with each labour council. The range of activities among these labour councils included: * organizing regional level rallies and demonstrations. * engaging in electoral campaigns during local and national elections. * making policy requests to local governments. * giving support to member unions when they were in a labour dispute. * promoting unionization of un-unionized workers. * getting involved in social movements at the regional level workers. In 1989, Sohyo was replaced with a formation of a new confederation: Rengo. This restructuring impacted the relationship that labour councils had with community unions: labour councils would no longer organize workers; they were now a part of Rengo’s Regional Organizations. These Regional Organizations do not have the freedom and activities that labour councils once had and do not support community unions thus some community unions broke up during this time. Community unions that remained faced challenges dealing with finances and autonomy workers. Japanese community unions function differently from US, Canadian, Australian, and UK community unions: their membership turnover is high, and membership rates are low. They are substantially smaller, have a weak financial base-requiring members to donate- and have high rank and file participation. These community unions take the form of a specific organizational model: Community Organization/No Union Partner. This framework of community unionism resembles US and Canadian Worker Centers but in practice is quite different. In addition, Japanese community unions do not tend to reflect coalition building like US, Canada, Australia, and UK. This can be explained by Japan’s lack of community-based organizations able to form alliances with community unions, and that Japanese community unions pursue individual issues opposed to broader range of issues that affect livelihoods of many people. Most issues that community unions deal with are: disputes over dismissals, working hours and leave, harassment, demotion or reduction in wages, discrimination, and working conditions. Community unions try to negotiate a settlement for the workers complaint and if it falls through, then are redirected to government labour committees or courts. Once a community union wins a case for a worker, the worker usually gives a part of his/her compensation back to the community union, and then resigns.  Community unions in the US  Like other advanced industrial economies, community unionism sprang up in the US in the 1980s. Community unions were formed from community and faith-based organizing networks, Central American solidarity movements and other left wing organizations, legal services and social service agencies, immigrant non-governmental organizations, churches, and labour unions. US community unions focus on issues that go beyond the workplace such as housing, health care, education, and immigration. Craft unionism in the US organized workers based on their trade by class or skill. The jobs these workers had were stable, paid a living wage, provided pensions, and offered long-term employment. Within the last 20 years, the highly competitive and mobile nature of US firms has resulted in outsourcing and subcontracting practices. These widespread practices have negative impacts on workers: lower wages, little/no access to benefits, decreased hours, and no pension. Not only are unions being dismantled by neoliberal policies, but the precarious work that has risen out of the US economy no longer identifies with craft union practices as low wage workers are facing different challenges. In addition, many jobs that are coming to characterize the US economy are non-unionized. Community unionism has been a response to these issues in the US, and has provided activities at a local level that work to set up labour market protections for low wage workers. They accomplish this by organizing members and allies in bringing pressure on elected officials to support them. Thus, US community unions rely on politics and public policy in creating change for members (wages, hours, working conditions). Community union membership may be based on ethnic, racial, religious affiliations and geographic areas. US community unions vary in their organizational framework. They reflect the 4 structures of community unions. For example: Community organization/ no union partner: Worker centers fall into this category. Labour Union or unions/ no community partner: SEIU’s National Justice for Janitors & CHOP Chicago Homecare Organizing Project. Community/ labour partnership but with community organization dominant: Partnership of Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF) and the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employers (AFSCME) in Baltimore & The Partnership of Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF) and the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) in Omaha. Community/labour partnership but with labour union dominant: The Stamford Organizing Project of the AFL-CIO.  Challenges in community unions  In “Community Unionism: A Strategy for Organizing in the New Economy”, Black highlights that community organizations can be territorial. This can lead to conflict when two separate groups try to organize the same community. Black also points out that conflict may also arise over what the focus of their organizing will be based on. Disagreement on the specific goals of the organization can take the form of short-term and long-term goals. Black also finds that there can be conflict on the internal structure of a community union (specifically, equal participation in the organization). In “Community Unions in Japan: Similarities Differences of Region Based Labour Movements between Japan and Other Industrialized Countries”, Suzuki finds that challenges arise because of the different ways of looking at community unions: community unions may not fall into a specific category and may bridge different elements of coalition building and social movements. For Suzuki, there may be difficulty in forming equal partnerships between unions and organizations, and workers and the unemployed. In Community Unionism A Comparative Analysis of Concepts and Contexts, McBride and Greenwood believe that traditional unions may have problems in giving up their power and control when forming alliances with community organizations. Traditional unions are structured hierarchically and operate differently from community organizations which may cause problems. McBride and Greenwood also found that there are no accessible spaces for communities to form relationships with trade unions. They found that these alliances are formed through formal meetings. This can be a problematic for expanding links into communities as it is a very narrow way of establishing relationships.

In 2014 Gloria Jean's was purchased by the Retail Food Group for $163.5 million. History Gloria Jean's Coffees was founded by Gloria Jean Kvetko in 1979 in Long Grove, Ill., a small town just outside Chicago. The firm began as a small coffee and gift shop in Chicago and grew to over 50 locations throughout the US. In 1995, Nabi Saleh and Peter Irvine, former managing director of advertising agency DDB Needham, visited the United States to sample the Gloria Jean's Coffees brand. Saleh and Irvine identified the opportunity for this brand in Australia, purchasing the international licensing rights from Diedrich Coffee, Inc. Saleh and Irvine established Jireh International Pty Ltd (trading as Gloria Jeans Coffees), the company that holds the right to franchise Gloria Jean's Coffees in Australia, and purchased the rights to the brand for all other countries from Diedrich Coffee, Inc, with the exceptions of the US and Puerto Rico. In late 1996, Jireh International Pty Ltd opened the first Gloria Jean's coffee house in Miranda, Sydney, and two weeks later another in Eastgardens, also in Sydney. In early 1998, Gloria Jean's Coffees Australia franchised its first store and within six years had opened 185 stores owned and operated by more than 100 franchisees. In 2003, a franchise opened in Darwin, making the brand available in every Australian state, the ACT and NT.Gloria Jean's Australia – Our Story Jireh International Pty Ltd formed a North American Affiliate, Praise International North America, Inc. and as of 14 June 2009, which also operates It's A Grind Coffee House in 13 states.It's a Grind Coffee House The North American rights were sold by Diedrich Coffee to the American affiliate of the Australian holding company.

Franchise owners pay franchise fees and royalties on their sales as well as operating costs.Franchise FAQ The organisation's board consists of chairman Nabi Saleh, and directors John Dwight, Peter Irvine and Andrew Tyndale. Controversies =Sugar and fat content= In 2009, Gloria Jean's was criticized for the sugar and fat content of some of their products. Analysis of a regular 'Gloria Jean's Mocha Chiller Coco Loco' revealed it contained 95.5 g of sugar, which is 106 percent of an adult's recommended daily intake. They have also been criticised for failing to provide nutritional information to their customers. Gloria Jean's now provides nutrition and ingredient information. =Coffee supply= In April 2010, Gloria Jean's parent company, Jireh International, was accused of breaking a joint venture agreement with a small US-based coffee supplier, Western Export Services. The matter was resolved in the High Court, in October 2011, with Western Export Services' appeal being dismissed. = Financial support for the Australian Christian Lobby = In November 2010, in the lead up to the Australian Federal Election, Gloria Jean's donated $30,000 to the Australian Christian Lobby (ACL). This donation and Gloria Jean's links to the evangelical Hillsong Church led to a national boycott of its stores. Social media campaigns in support of the boycott on Facebook and a petition on Change.org resulted in thousands of supporters. As a direct result of this donation, national youth mental health foundation headspace pulled out as a partner of the suicide awareness campaign RU OK, of which Gloria Jean's was a major sponsor. Gloria Jean's released a statement on 11 June 2012 stating \\"this was a once off donation\\". Both Gloria Jean's and the ACL claim that the monies were provided as advertising.

Summary  The document describes the position of the Catholic Church on the meaning and role of marriage and the family, and outlines challenges towards realizing that ideal. It refers to marriage as \\"one of the most precious and most urgent tasks of Christian couples in our time\\"FC 20. as \\"the foundation of the wider community of the family, since the very institution of marriage and conjugal love are ordained to the procreation and education of children, in whom they find their crowning.\\"FC 14. Among other observations, Familiaris consortio restates the Church's opposition to artificial birth control, stated previously in Humanae vitae, and briefly mentions the opposition of the Church to abortion. It also discusses the responsibility and expectations of the family regarding the education of children. It continues with a description of the expectations of the family relative to the larger society, including service to the poor. The document establishes that \\"any violence\\" applied \\"in favor of contraception or, still worse, of sterilization and procured abortion, must be altogether condemned and forcefully rejected\\".FC 30 It foresees the restoration of the Covenant mediated by Jesus Christ God,FC 10 and the restoration of the society in compliance with the God's plan of salvation for all the human kind. The final (and more articulated) portion of the document describes expectations of the family which more directly involve the Catholic Faith in daily life, relating it to several of the Catholic sacraments, particularly marriage, and strongly urging family prayer. In particular, this section of the document restates the expectation of a permanent Catholic union for all members of the Church seeking marriage. It rejects the acceptability of alternative arrangements, including \\"trial marriages\\", exclusively civil marriages, and unions with no publicly recognized bond.  Pope Francis' Amoris laetitia  In 2016, Pope Francis published the post-synodal apostolic exhortation Amoris laetitia. Various media outlets reported what many were calling a potential change in Church teaching on the ability of remarried divorcées to receive the Eucharist, to which they said Francis alluded in footnote no. 351, which reads (with footnoted body text in italics): > Because forms of conditioning and mitigating factors, it is possible that in > an objective situation of sin – which may not be subjectively culpable, or > fully such – a person can be living in God's grace, can love and can also > grow in the life of grace and charity, while receiving the Church's help to > this end. > 351\\\\. In certain cases, this can include the help of the sacraments. Hence, > “I want to remind priests that the confessional must not be a torture > chamber, but rather an encounter with the Lord's mercy” (Apostolic > Exhortation Evangelii Gaudium [24 November 2013], 44: AAS 105 [2013], 1038). > I would also point out that the Eucharist “is not a prize for the perfect, > but a powerful medicine and nourishment for the weak” (ibid., 47: 1039).AL > 305.

It is an Institute of Public Character. It is currently led by Artistic Director, Ong Keng Sen. TheatreWorks was established in 1985. Since the establishment, the company has staged over 200 productions and 2,500 performances in Singapore and overseas, and has reached an audienceship of over a million. TheatreWorks’ home is 72-13, a heritage building that was once a rice warehouse on Mohamed Sultan Road and next to the Singapore River. TheatreWorks/72-13 is dedicated to the development of contemporary arts in Singapore and to the evolution of an Asian identity and aesthetics of the 21st Century through a culture of differences. It asks, what is Asian in this age of globalisation, internationalisation, modernisation and urbanisation? Its works exist on the tension between modernisation and tradition; local and global. TheatreWorks’ projects present the hybrid identity of the contemporary Asian and embrace the multiple realities. TheatreWorks is a multi-faceted arts company but always working intensively across languages, art forms, disciplines and socio-political borders. Rather than residing stably in the staid singularity of one Art or one Culture, TheatreWorks believes in the idea of leaving one’s own position, one’s locality, and locating oneself in the unknown – to co-work and co-create in a third space. TheatreWorks has two main red lines in its work: the first is the creation and presentation of inter-disciplinary and intercultural productions/programmes that bring together artists from across disciplines and cultures and from both the traditional and contemporary worlds. The second being Docu-Performances which are performances created from historical instances and phenomena, archival materials, real-life experiences and living persons. TheatreWorks thrives on developing processes, creative partnerships and artistic risk-taking. One of these processes that has gained international influence is the Flying Circus Project (FCP) first conceived by Ong Keng Sen in 1996. The FCP is a long-term programme exploring creative expression in Asia. Its focal points are individual creative action, encountering difference and strategies of art practice, emphasizing the tenacity of local sites – with their artists, activists and public intellectuals. The FCP is curated around the central notion of “world creating”, how do we form new micro-worlds, which are responsible, articulated and ethically engaged? The 8th Edition of the FCP was in Dec 2012/Jan 2013 and was sited in Myanmar and Singapore. TheatreWorks is committed to developing and nurturing professional arts skills by providing residencies to mid-career artists as well as Research and Development programmes to a variety of artists, creatives and cultural workers using 72-13 as an incubator and laboratory. In addition, TheatreWorks also encourages new writing through The Writer’s Laboratory (established in 1990) which organizes the annual and popular 24-Hour Playwriting Competition since 1998. TheatreWorks is distinctly the only performing arts company in Singapore involve in capacity building in Asia as well as steadfastly building a dialogue and bridge in Asia and Asia’s interface with the rest of the world. Since 1999, TheatreWorks hosts and manages the Arts Network Asia (ANA). ANA has been a unique networking and grant-giving body for intra-Asia collaborations in multiple disciplines, encouraging mobility within Asia as well as developing managerial skills in Asia. It pays attention to the diverse perspectives of a global Asian urban metropolis and the multiple contexts of everyday life in Asia. With The Continuum Asia Project and Mobilising Arts Communities, TheatreWorks capacity-build in Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia respectively. The CAP helps to preserve the rich cultural heritage of Asia by reviving dying traditional art forms. TheatreWorks is assisting the Royal Ballet Theatre at Luang Prabang to revive the Laotian Ramayana. The MAC, on the other hand, serves to link artists and local communities through capacity building and harnessing skills of participating artists in Vietnam and Cambodia.

Dickerson and starring Ice-T, Rutger Hauer, and Gary Busey. It is loosely based on the 1924 short story \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" by Richard Connell. Plot Jack Mason is a homeless man from Seattle, Washington who loses his only friends—Hank, a fellow homeless man and his pet dog—on the same day. Dejected, Mason attempts to commit suicide when a soup kitchen worker, Walter Cole, saves him. Cole refers him to businessman Thomas Burns, who kindly offers Mason a job as a hunting guide. Despite his misgivings, the lure of a well paying job causes Mason to accept. Flying to a remote cabin surrounded by hundreds of acres of woods, Mason meets the rest of the hunting party, all of whom paid $50,000 for the privilege of being there. In addition to Burns and Cole, the party includes Doc Hawkins, the founder of the hunt and a psychopathic psychiatrist who specializes in psychological assessments, Texas \\"oil man\\" John Griffin, and wealthy executive Derek Wolfe Sr. and his son Derek Wolfe Jr., the latter of whom is at first unaware of the true purposes of the hunt. On the first night, all the men are eating a nice dinner and engaging in conversation. Mason receives a pack of cigarettes from Hawkins and learns a little about his past. Hawkins relays a brutal story from his childhood when his father forced him to train and then fight his dog as a lesson in being a man. The following morning, Mason is awakened with a gun in his face by Cole, who explains that the men are not hunting any animals, but rather Mason himself. Mason is given a head start with only the time it takes the others to eat breakfast. Mason quickly flees the area, but comes to a realization and turns back. The hunters finish their meal and set off after him. Wolfe Jr. is horrified at the thought of killing a man, but is pushed into it by his father. The hunters race off into the forest, but by now Mason has returned to the cabin in search of weapons. He finds none, and instead makes the disgusting discovery of the hunters' trophy room behind a locked door: the preserved heads of the victims of previous hunts. Mason decides to burn the cabin down using chemicals found outside the cabin. The hunters quickly assume Mason's return to the cabin and go back. Wolfe Sr. enters just as Mason lights up the cabin and engages in a fist fight with Hawkins out back, away from the others. Hawkins is knocked back into the cabin as the preserving agent explodes, killing him in the inferno. Wolfe Jr. saves his father, and spots Mason fleeing in the process. The hunt resumes and Mason begins to use his wits to beat the hunters, luring them with falsely-planted lit cigarettes to lead them in the wrong way. Mason manages to lure Griffin away from the others, and takes him hostage. Over the night, Mason learns why Griffin is taking part in the hunt. Years earlier, his daughter was murdered by a homeless man and he's venting his rage, which was enhanced earlier when he asked Mason what happened to his family and Mason sarcastically snarled \\"I killed them.\\" Mason then reveals that he didn't kill his family, that they died in an apartment fire that he couldn't rescue them from, and Griffin realizes that Mason's comment earlier means that Mason blames himself for the tragedy even though it wasn't his fault. This leads Griffin to have a change of heart in the morning. Upon rescuing him, Griffin reveals his decision to not continue the hunting, but is murdered by Cole to prevent any future legal conflicts. By now, with their numbers dwindling, the remaining hunters seem more intent on killing Mason. Mason sabotages one of their ATVs, causing it to explode. The explosion rips off most of Cole's lower body, mortally wounding him. Burns then uses his fingers to apply pressure to Cole's jugulars in order to kill him and spare him from the pain. As they pursue Mason, Wolfe Jr. is killed by accident when he falls in a ravine, and Wolfe Sr. vows revenge in a fit of rage. The second night sees Wolfe Sr. and Mason fighting one on one with Mason the victor and Burns escaping to the city, knowing that Mason will most likely be searching for him. Days later, Burns is back in Seattle, preparing to leave his current identity, hoping to escape both Mason and the legal responsibilities resulting from the disastrous hunt. But Mason has escaped the forest, returned to the city, and tracked him down. A fight ensues where Mason beats up Burns and takes his gun, but instead of shooting the evil man Mason just leaves the gun and walks away. Burns picks up the gun, thinking Mason screwed up and prepares to shoot him. What he doesn't realize is Mason used a tip from his late friend Hank and messed with the barrel on Burns' gun; when Burns tries to kill Mason, the gun backfires and kills Burns instead.

He did give praise to the cinematography and the efforts of the main cast, singling out Ice-T for having on-screen charisma but being a bit unconvincing as an action star, concluding with, \\"Still, for a few moments there, the movie gives Robert Bly just what he deserves.\\" Marjorie Baumgarten of The Austin Chronicle was critical of the script's characters and overall message as being \\"out-of-whack and sophomoric\\" but gave credit to the actors portraying them and the production team for being a vital element in Dickerson's filmmaking, saying that, \\"[H]e has a definite flair for action pictures but the stunning contributions from cinematographer Bojan Bazelli add immeasurably to the movie.\\" = Box office = Surviving the Game debuted at number 6 at the box office and grossed $7.7 million in the US.Surviving the Game on The-Numbers.com See also * List of American films of 1994 References External links * * Category:1994 films Category:1994 action thriller films Category:American chase films Category:American action thriller films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films about homelessness Category:Films set in Seattle Category:Films about hunters Category:Films set in forests Category:Films directed by Ernest Dickerson Category:Films scored by Stewart Copeland Category:Films about death games ","title":"Surviving the Game"},{"id":"3417077","text":"Map of the lands of Bellême William I Talvas (c. 995 – c. 1060), seigneur of Alençon. According to Orderic Vitalis his nickname Talvas meaning shield, presumably alluded to his hardness or callousness like that of a shield. He was a member of the House of Bellême. Life He was a son of William of Bellême and Mathilde of Condé-sur-Noireau. He held lands at Bellême, Domfront and Alençon,Jean Jacques Gautier, Histoire d'Alençon (Poulet-Malassis, Imprimeur-Libraire, Place Bourbon, 1805), p. 24 He obtained the lands of Bellême from his brother Yves de Bellême, Bishop of SéezWhile Orderic stated that William Talvas succeeded his brother Robert, Yves (a.k.a. Ivo) inherited the lands of Bellême at the death of Robert about two years before he became Bishop of Séez in 1035. William Talvas probably held the lands from his brother Yves while he was Bishop and recovered the other family lands on his own. William Talvas never was lord of Bellême as evidenced by his use of his nickname 'Talvas' instead of de Bellême. See Geoffrey H. White, 'The First House of Bellême', Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, Fourth Series, Vol. 22 (1940), pp. 81-3.Geoffrey H.

According to Orderic, William had her strangled on her way to church, because she loved God and would not support his wickedness. William married secondly a daughter of Ralf de Beaumont, Viscount of Maine.Geoffrey H. White, 'The First House of Bellême', Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, Fourth Series, Vol. 22 (1940), p. 85 Among the private feuds going on during the minority of Duke William was one that erupted between William Talvas and William fitz Giroie. William fitz Giroie was a vassal of William Talvas and his father Giroie, Lord of Échauffour had assisted Talvas' father and uncle in the struggles against Herbert I Wake-dog, Count of Maine.For additional information on the wars between Bishop Avesguad de Belleme and Herbert I 'Wake-Dog', Count of Maine see the articles William of Bellême and Avesgaud de Bellême. William fitz Giroie himself had greatly assisted William Talvas in obtaining his own lands, apparently by force. But William fitz Giroie was also a vassal of Geoffrey de Mayenne, an adherent, in turn, of the Count of Maine. About 1044 William Talvas attacked the castle of Montaigu which was being defended by William fitz Giroie. Unable to defeat the castle William Talvas captured Geoffrey de Mayenne and held him prisoner until William Fitz Giroie destroyed the castle of Montaigu.Geoffrey H. White, 'The First House of Bellême', Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, Fourth Series, Vol. 22 (1940), p. 84 William fitz Giroie immediately razed his own castle to free his lord and in return Geoffrey de Mayenne built fitz Giroie a new castle at St. Cenery on the river Sarthe.Guy Halsall, Violence and Society in the Early Medieval West, (The Boydell Press, Woodbridge, UK, 1998), p. 132 This apparently caused great resentment in William Talvas. On the occasion of his second wedding, William Talvas invited William fitz Giroie to attend. Suspecting nothing fitz Giroie while a guest at the festivities was suddenly seized by Talvas' men and imprisoned, then according to Orderic horribly mutilated and blinded before being released. Somehow William Giroie survived his torture and mutilation and retired to Bec Abbey to live out the remainder of his life as a monk.François Neveux, A brief History of The Normans, Trans. Howard Curtis (Constable & Robinson, Ltd., London, 2006), p. 113 To avenge this atrocity the sons and kinsmen of William fitz Giroie sacked and destroyed the lands of William Talvas who would not face them in the field.The Gesta Normannorum Ducum of William of Jumièges, Orderic Vitalis, and Robert of Torigni, Vol. II, Ed. & Trans. Elisabeth M.C. Van Houts (The Clarendon Press, Oxford & New York, 1995), pp. 110-12 Finally, Talvas' son Arnulf rebelled and exiled his father, now reviled by everyone. He wandered until he was taken in by the de Montgomery family whose son Roger agreed to marry his daughter Mabel in return for the lands William lost. It seems certain that after the death of Arnulf the following year, that William Talvas recovered his lands. William confirmed a gift to St. Aubin of Angers made by his brother Yves circa 1060-2 and after that nothing more is heard of him. Family By Hildeburg, his first wife, William had two children: * Arnulf de Bellême, who deprived his father of his estates and wealth and was dead by 1049. * Mabel de Bellême, who married Roger de Montgomerie, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury and was murdered 2 Dec 1079George Edward Cokayne, The Complete Peerage; or, a History of the House of Lords and all its Members from the Earliest Times, Volume XI, Ed.

It is distributed throughout the Palearctic realm. Mounted Distribution The Apamea crenata occupies varied habitats. It colonizes grass-rich, uncut, and moist to mesophilic places such as wet meadows, fens, forest edges or clearcuts. This moth is abundant in Europe and Asia, most prevalently in cooler climes. This species particularly avoids hot regions and sometimes appears in mountains. Description and variation This species has a wingspan of 36 to 44 mm. The forewings are pale brown with darker patches along the margins, usually with prominent markings at the base and tornus. The hindwings are grayish with darker venation. Melanic forms occur fairly frequently. This moth flies at night and is attracted to light and sugar, particularly nectar-rich flowers. In the British Isles, it is active from May to July.  Morphology  A. crenata has a pale, lilac-grey forewing, often washed in pale brown. The veins are pale, with a coastal area tinged with purplish grey, and the inner margin tinted with white. It has a thick black streak near the base, with double inner and outer lines. A brownish outer line is followed by a double row of dark-brown vein dots with a white dot between. The claviform stigma is brown, with a darker outline. The orbicular is generally elongated and narrow, sometimes shortened and rounder, with a brown, reniform-shaped centre and a pale outline. The outer half of the reniform is paler than the inner, and the lower lobe is a darker cell and median shade brown, the latter not reaching below the cell; the marginal area beyond submarginal line is dark red-brown, emitting large teeth inwards on the two folds. The hind-wing is fuscous, pale grey towards the base; [abbreviation argentea Tutt is a form from Scotland in which the ground colour] of fore- wings is shiny whitish, with traces of faint brownish costal streaks. The terminal area and basal streaks are pale brown. It lacks all other markings, except a trace of reniform stigma. The hind-wing is pale grey; - ochrea Tutt and intermedia Tutt seem to represent merely the type form when washed with pale ochreous, or with rufous ochreous respectively, this latter is the commonest form in Britain. Flavorufa Tutt is a rare species. It is found only in the north of England and Scotland. It is a dull yellow red. It lacks the usual markings, except the stigmata, which are distinct and outlined with yellow markings. Short, yellow dashes may appear on its body, with a yellow patch at the base of the costa, and/or some yellow scales on the dark veins. The putris moth's fore-wing is suffused with dull grey-brown, with the middle area between inner and outer lines darker brown from the costa to the inner margin. The white scales of inner margin are plainer. Some examples are more uniformly dark and with obscured markings, while others are paler brown and show the markings clearly. The combusta moth is a dark fuscous form of this breed, in which the basal area and both hues are mixed with white scales, the outer edge of the reniform is also whitish. The alopecurus is red-brown with dark veins, the costa, and inner margin and sometimes the veins dusted white, with yellow-edgd stigmata; the two folds are redder than the rest. In some cases, this red tint predominates and makes the whole wing red. In others the blackish shades overpower the red, these are classified as nigrorubida. The subarea Petersen is a form with the fore-wing darkened with grey-brown, with clear markings, and the reniform not picked out with yellow. The extincta from Issykkul and Kuku Nor has the fore-wing pale uniform lilac grey. The terminal area and the cell are a dull red-brown. The hues are very indistinctly expressed and the stigmata a pale grey. The outer edge of the reniform will be whitish with a dark form corresponding to this. The uniformis is a completely dull dark liver colour, with no markings except the pale inner and outer lines and the whitish outer edge of the reniform stigma. The hind-wing, like the extincta, is a smooth pale grey.Seitz, A.

He was born in New Jersey in 1783 and came to Upper Canada with his family in 1796. He was largely self-schooled and was employed by the government of the province to survey the Talbot settlement and the Talbot Road in 1809 and settled near Port Talbot some time after that. During the War of 1812, he served in the local militia, was captured by raiders and his property was destroyed. After the war, he continued his survey work in Kent and Essex Counties, and on the Talbot Road. This difficult work took its toll on Burwell's health. He was often paid in land, rather than cash, and acquired large land holdings scattered across the southwestern part of the province. In 1830, he laid out the plan for the village of Port Burwell on Lake Erie; he also set up a company to develop the harbour and export timber from the area. In 1812, he was elected to the 6th Parliament of Upper Canada representing Oxford & Middlesex. He represented the area until 1824 and then again from 1830 to 1834. In 1813, he was appointed justice of the peace. Burwell benefited from his close ties as friend and employee of Thomas Talbot and received other patronage posts in the region. He was ahead of his time in proposing that local taxation be used to support education. In 1836, he was elected to represent the town of London in the Legislative Assembly. In later life, his influence declined possibly as a result of ill health. Mahlon Burwell provided land on which Trinity Church, an example of early Gothic Revival architecture, was constructed in 1836.

Lococo was known within the Kansas City crime family as an enforcer in his early years. Later on, he controlled an interest in several illegal gambling establishments. The Five Iron Men of Kansas City Allan May, Americanmafia.com  Arrival in Kansas City  In the 1930s, Lococo was frequently mentioned in local newspaper articles about major mob-related events. According to grand jury testimony, Lococo helped gunmen escape from the scene of the bloody June 1933 Union Station massacre in Kansas City. Lococo, Tony Gizzo, Charles Gargotta and Dominick Binaggio (brother of Charles Binaggio) allegedly provided the gunmen with a stolen car and escorted them out of the city a few days later.  Shootout with the Sheriff  By pure chance, County Sheriff Bash, one of his deputies, the sheriff's wife, and a teenaged girl were a block away from the murder scene when they heard gunfire; they all were returning from a party. The sheriff directed his deputy to drive toward the sound of the gunfire. As the sheriff's car stopped at Armour and Forest, Gargotta and Lococo were still standing in the street. Scola and Fasone were in the front seat of the getaway car with the engine running. Scola saw Sheriff Bash exit his car with a 12 gauge shotgun; he gunned the engine and plowed his getaway car directly into the Sheriff's car. Still in their wrecked car, both Scola and Fasone opened fire on Bash, but he quickly cut them down with his riot gun (Scola and Fasone died at the scene). Meanwhile, Lococo took off on foot (his headquarters was a few blocks away). The deputy, now out of the car, exchanged shots with Lococo. Throwing down his gun, Lococo disappeared down an alley. As Lococo made his escape, Gargotta charged Sheriff Bash with guns blazing. However, Gargotta soon ran out of ammunition and surrendered to Bash. Despite the dubious efforts of the local police force (which was very corrupt at the time), Lococo was never charged for Anthon's murder or the ensuing shootout. But in 1939, during a citywide cleanup campaign, Lococo was charged with income tax evasion and sent to prison for a short term. This would be Lococo's only major conviction.  Later years  By the late 1940s, Lococo was stricken with arthritis and was making health-related trips to the U.S. Southwest and Mexico. In 1948, he moved to Nogales, Arizona, and purchased a small hotel. Lococo then attempted to open a gambling operation in the hotel, but the Santa Cruz County Sheriff thwarted his project. Lococo finally sold the hotel and returned to Kansas City. In March 1950, Lococo was identified at a conference of U.S. and Sicilian Mafia members at a hotel in Tijuana, Mexico. When local Mexican police found out about the conference, they ended it prematurely. Less than a month after the Tijuana conference, both Kansas City boss Charles Binaggio and underboss Gargotta were assassinated. A few years later, during the U.S. Senate hearings on organized crime (the Kefauver hearings) it was speculated that the decision to whack Binaggio had been made at this conference. However, there was no way to ever prove it. In the 1960s, Lococo retired in Kansas City. In his later years, a Kansas City pizza restaurant (\\"Gaetano's\\") was reportedly named for him. In the late 1990s, Gaetano Lococo died of natural causes.

Biography = Soviet Union = Born in Moscow, Kazhdan was educated at the Pedagogical Institute of Ufa and the University of Moscow, where he studied with the historian of medieval England, Evgenii Kosminskii.Bryer, Anthony. \\"Obituary: Alexander Kazhdan.\\" The Independent. 5 June 1997. Retrieved August 28, 2010. A post-war Soviet initiative to revive Russian-language Byzantine studies led Kazhdan to write a dissertation on the agrarian history of the late Byzantine empire (published in 1952 as Agrarnye otnosheniya v Vizantii XIII-XIV vv.) Despite a growing reputation in his field, anti-Semitic prejudice in the Joseph Stalin-era Soviet academy forced Kazhdan to accept a series of positions as a provincial teacher (in Ivanovo, 1947–49, and Tula, 1949–52). Following the death of Stalin in 1953, however, Kazhdan's situation improved, and he was hired by a college in Velikie Luki. In 1956 he finally secured a position in the Institute for History of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, where he remained until leaving the Soviet Union in 1978. Kazhdan was an immensely prolific scholar throughout his Soviet career, publishing well over 500 books, articles, and reviews, and his publications contributed to the growing international prestige of Soviet Byzantine studies.Laiou, Angeliki E.; Alice-Mary Talbot (1997). \\"Alexander Petrovich Kazhdan, 1922-1997.\\" Dumbarton Oaks Papers, Vol. 51, (1997), pp. xii-xvii. His 1954 article, \\"Vizantiyskie goroda v VII-XI vv.,\\" published in the journal Sovetskaya arkheologiya, argued on the basis of archaeological and numismatic evidence that the seventh century constituted a major rupture in the urban society of Byzantium. This thesis has since been widely accepted and has led to intensive research on discontinuity in Byzantine history and the subsequent rejection of the earlier conception of the medieval Byzantine empire as a frozen relic of late antiquity. Other major studies dating from this first half of Kazhdan's career include Derevnya i gorod v Vizantii IX-X vv. (1960), a study of the relationship between city and countryside in the 9th and 10th centuries; Vizantiyskaya kul'tura (X-XII vv.) (1968), a study of Middle Byzantine culture; and Sotsial'ny sostav gospodstvujushchego klassa Vizantii XI-XII vv. (1974), an influential prosopographical and statistical study of the structure of the Byzantine ruling class in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Kazhdan also contributed heavily to the field of Armenian studies, notably writing about the Armenians who formed the elite ruling classes that governed the Byzantine Empire during the Middle Byzantine Era in his Armiane v sostave gospodstvuyushchego klassa Vizantiyskoy imperii v XI-XII vv. (1975). Аpмянe в составе господствующего класса Визaнтийcкoй импepии в XI- XII вв. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1975. = United States = In 1975, Kazhdan's son, the mathematician David Kazhdan, emigrated to the United States, where he accepted a position at Harvard University. This produced an immediate change in Kazhdan's situation in the Soviet Union; his wife, Musja, was fired from her position at a Moscow publishing house and censorship of his work by his superiors in the Soviet academic establishment increased. In October 1978 Alexander and Musja left the Soviet Union, having received a visa for immigration to Israel, coming to the United States three years afterward. In February 1979 they arrived at Dumbarton Oaks, a center for Byzantine studies in Washington, D.C., where Kazhdan held the position of senior research associate until his death. Kazhdan's first major publications in English were collaborative: People and Power in Byzantium (1982), a broad ranging study of Byzantine society, was written with Giles Constable; Studies in Byzantine literature (1984) with Simon Franklin; and Change in Byzantine Culture in the Eleventh and Twelfth Centuries (1985) with Ann Wharton Epstein. His greatest English-language project was likewise a massive collaborative effort: the three-volume Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium (1991), edited by Kazhdan, was the first reference work of the sort ever to be published, and remains an indispensable point of departure for all areas of Byzantine studies. He wrote approximately 20%, or about 1,000, of the entries in the Dictionary, which are signed with his initials A.K. As Kazhdan became more comfortable with English, his pace of publication once again matched that of his Russian years. His later scholarship is above all marked with a growing concern with Byzantine literature, particularly hagiography. Kazhdan died in Washington, D.C. in 1997. His death cut short his work on a monumental History of Byzantine Literature; however, the first volume of this work, covering the period from 650 to 850, was published in 1999.

Biography Daniele was born to a working-class family in Naples, his father being a harbor worker. A self-taught guitarist, he began his career as a musician playing for other successful singers of the 1970s. His debut in the Italian music world was in 1977 with the album Terra mia, which proved to be a successful mix of Neapolitan tradition and Blues sounds. Daniele defined his music with the term \\"tarumbò\\", which indicated a mix of tarantella, blues and rumba. His lyrics also attracted critical praise: written and sung in an intense Neapolitan, they contained strong and bitter accusations against the social injustices of Naples, as well as Italian society in general, and included melancholic personal themes. Several of the later songs are characterized by a free intermingling of English, Italian and Neapolitan passages. Daniele's talent was confirmed on the following album Pino Daniele (1979). He scored his greatest success in 1980, with Nero a metà (\\"Half-Black Skinned\\"), which was noted by some authorities as the hallmark of the rebirth of Neapolitan song. In that year Daniele opened the Bob Marley concert at the San Siro stadium in Milan. In 1981 Vai Mo was released. The presence of some of the most renowned musicians of the Neapolitan musical milieu, including James Senese, Enzo Avitabile, Tullio De Piscopo and Tony Esposito, as session men on his albums has also been widely praised. In 1982, Daniele shifted to a personal and early version of world music: in Bella 'mbriana musicians such as Alphonso Johnson and Wayne Shorter appeared as guest players. In the following year Daniele held a concert in Havana, and later formed a Latin-American band. In 1983 Daniele collaborated with the American singer/guitarist Richie Havens on Common Ground, an album written and played together. His interest in Arabic music is emphasized on Bonne Soirée (1987), while the subsequent Schizzechea With Love (1988) was more Mediterranean-oriented. In the same year he started a collaboration with the Italian actor and director Massimo Troisi: Daniele completed the soundtracks for Troisi's films Le vie del Signore sono finite and Pensavo fosse amore invece era un calesse. Non calpestare i fiori nel deserto, released in Spring 1995, is an attempt to revive inspiration through African and Ethnic influences, and sold more than 800,000 copies. The subsequent tour ended with a double date with Jazz guitarist Pat Metheny. In 2010, Daniele played at Crossroads Guitar Festival, called by his friend Eric Clapton at Toyota Park in Chicago, playing with Joe Bonamassa and Robert Randolph. In 2011, he performed in concert with Clapton at Cava de' Tirreni stadium. Daniele died of a heart attack on 4 January 2015, at Sant'Eugenio Hospital in Rome. Covers Many artists recorded cover versions of Pino Daniele's songs: among others, Sarah Jane Morris (Alleria on album Cello Song), Randy Crawford (Quanno chiove, in English It's Raining, on album Through the Eyes of Love), Patricia Marx (Quanno chiove, in Portuguese Quando chove, on album Charme do mundo), Marisa Monte (E po' che fa, in Portuguese Bem que se quis, on album MM), and Issac Delgado (Quando, on album Malecon).

During the first phase of the project, from 1996 to 2000, approximately US$2.2 billion was distributed. By 2008, China had 116 institutions of higher education (about 6 percent) designated as 211 Project institutions for having met certain scientific, technical, and human resources standards and offering advanced degree programs. Project 211 schools take on the responsibility of training four-fifths of doctoral students, two-thirds of graduate students, half of students from abroad and one-third of undergraduates. They offer 85% of the state's key subjects, hold 96% of the state's key laboratories, and consume 70% of scientific research funding.Over 10 billion yuan to be invested in \\"211 Project\\" - People's Daily Online According to the Academic Ranking of World Universities 2018/19 and the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2019/20, most of these universities in the Project 211 are ranked among the top 1000 universities worldwide.

Metric trees exploit properties of metric spaces such as the triangle inequality to make accesses to the data more efficient. Examples include the M-tree, vp-trees, cover trees, MVP Trees, and BK-trees. Multidimensional search Most algorithms and data structures for searching a dataset are based on the classical binary search algorithm, and generalizations such as the k-d tree or range tree work by interleaving the binary search algorithm over the separate coordinates and treating each spatial coordinate as an independent search constraint. These data structures are well-suited for range query problems asking for every point (x,y) that satisfies \\\\mbox{min}_x \\\\leq x \\\\leq \\\\mbox{max}_x and \\\\mbox{min}_y \\\\leq y \\\\leq \\\\mbox{max}_y. A limitation of these multidimensional search structures is that they are only defined for searching over objects that can be treated as vectors. They aren't applicable for the more general case in which the algorithm is given only a collection of objects and a function for measuring the distance or similarity between two objects. If, for example, someone were to create a function that returns a value indicating how similar one image is to another, a natural algorithmic problem would be to take a dataset of images and find the ones that are similar according to the function to a given query image. Metric data structures If there is no structure to the similarity measure then a brute force search requiring the comparison of the query image to every image in the dataset is the best that can be done . If, however, the similarity function satisfies the triangle inequality then it is possible to use the result of each comparison to prune the set of candidates to be examined. The first article on metric trees, as well as the first use of the term \\"metric tree\\", published in the open literature was by Jeffrey Uhlmann in 1991. Other researchers were working independently on similar data structures. In particular, Peter Yianilos claimed to have independently discovered the same method, which he called a vantage point tree (VP-tree). The research on metric tree data structures blossomed in the late 1990s and included an examination by Google co-founder Sergey Brin of their use for very large databases. The first textbook on metric data structures was published in 2006.

The river flows through Palakkad district, Thrissur District and Ernakulam District of Kerala. The total drainage area of the river is 1704 km2. out of this 1404 km2 lies in Kerala and the rest 300 km2 in Tamil Nadu. The length of the river is 145.5 km. Though Chalakudy river in strict geological sense is a tributary of the Periyar river, for all practical purposes it is treated as a separate river by Government and other agencies. The River has gained its name, since it flows along the banks of the Chalakudy Town, the major settlement along the course of the river. It is perhaps the most unpolluted and pristine river in the state and even in India due to the limited amount of industries and wastage disposal around it. Chalakudy River and its basin area were one of the most affected rivers during the 2018 Kerala floods. Origin The river though has its origin in the Anamalai region of Tamil Nadu, is actually a collection of some major tributaries originated from Parambikulam, Kuriyarkutti, Sholayar, Karapara and Anakayam in Kerala. Riparian vegetation Sun Catfish known as Manjakoori (Horabagrus brachysoma) is found extensively in Chalakudy River Chalakudy River is the one of very few rivers of Kerala with relics of riparian vegetation in substantial level. The annual report of the National Bureau of Fish Genetic Resources Lucknow, mentioned that the Chalakudy River is the richest river in fish diversity perhaps in India. The riparian forests of the Chalakudy River have revealed the existence of a thick riparian vegetation of more than 10 metres width for a distance of 10.5 km downstream from Peringalkuth, covering an area of 58.5 hectares. Out of this, 26.4 hectares lie within the Vazachal area, including three large islands densely covered by riparian forests. The riparian forests of the area have been found to be characterised by the presence of typical riparian species of plants, in addition to evergreen and semi-evergreen species. Out of the 319 species of flowering plants identified from the study area, 24 are endemic species of the Western Ghats and 10 are rare and endangered. Fauna Chalakudy River anticipating the monsoons The Chalakudy River is known for its diversity, as it contains 98 species of fresh water fishes out of the 152 species known from Kerala.Ajithkumar, C.R., K.R. Devi, and K.R. Thomas (1999). Fish fauna, abundance and distribution in Chalakudy river system, Kerala. Journal of the Bombay Natural. Among these, 35 are endemic species of the Western Ghats and 31 are either vulnerable (11 species), endangered (16 species) or critically endangered (4 species) from indiscriminate collection for the aquarium fish trade, overfishing, pollution, dams and introduced species.Raghavan, R., G. Prasad, P. H. Anvar Ali, B. Pereira (2008). Fish fauna of Chalakudy River, part of Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, Kerala, India: patterns of distribution, threats and conservation needs. Biodiversity and Conservation 17(13): 3119-3131 According to a report of the National Bureau of Fish Genetic Resources in Lucknow, Chalakudy could well be the richest river in fish diversity in India, with thick vegetation on both sides. Among the fish species in the river, the most species rich family are the Cyprinids, followed by Bagrid catfishes and hillstream loaches. Among others, Horabagrus nigricollaris and Sahyadria chalakkudiensis are endemic to the Chalakudy River. Waterfalls The Sunrise over the Chalakudy River from Vettilapara BridgeThe famous waterfalls, Athirappilly Falls and Vazhachal Falls, are situated on this river. The hydro electric projects on Chalakkudy River are Sholayar Hydro Electric Project and Peringalkuttu Hydro Electric Project. For irrigation purposes Thumboormoozhy Dam is constructed across this river. It merges with the Periyar River near Elenthikara, adjacent to Manjali, North Paravur in Ernakulam District and finally Joins Kodungallur Backwaters and Join Arabian sea at Azhekode. The Parambikulam Dam has been built on the Parambikulam River, one of its four tributaries. 2018 Kerala floods Though officially the flood was severe on 16 August 2018, the banks of the Chalakudy River started flooding from the early hours of 15th August 2018 due to unusually high rainfall during the monsoon season. All the streams, low-lying areas and agricultural fields in the river's proximity was flooded already and the river was correcting the meandering curves created through its centuries of history. All the towns and villages within 5 km of the river were flooded except the slightly high hill tops. It was the worst flood in Chalakudy in nearly a century. The Indian government had declared it a Level 3 Calamity, or \\"calamity of a severe nature\\". It is the worst flood in Kerala after the great flood of 99 that took place in 1924. Aftermath of the floods The aftermath of the flood was very severe as it changed the overall outlook of the riverway from the mountains to the river mouth. Large areas of the river banks collapsed and caved in due to the powerful currents in the floods and new banks were created as a result. Huge trees along in the course were uprooted and deposited all along its flow especially on the bridges. Many road bridges even got displaced by a few cm due to the water's force like the Vettilapara Bridge. Also the fauna in the river was greatly affected as the indigenous fish species were displaced from its natural habitats and to make things worse foreign species were revealed into the river system from the nearby fish farms that had hundreds of varieties of aquarium fishes like the Arapaima, Arowana, Piranha, Alligator Gar, Flowerhorn cichlid, Red-bellied Pacu to name a few. After the floods, an Arapaima of 65 kg, which was grown in a local farm as a tourist attraction, was caught from the Chalakudy river. It is the largest freshwater invasive fish found in Kerala.

The club was formed in 2005 by the merger of Tynecastle Boys Club and Tollcross United. They play at the Meggetland Sports Complex in Edinburgh and are currently managed by Stephen McLeish. History The original Tynecastle Boys Club were formed in 1928, and the club take this to be the date of their formation as can be seen on the club crest. As a youth team, a number of young footballers played for Tynecastle Boys Club on their way to successful careers. Former Scotland captain Darren Fletcher played for Tynecastle during the 1990s. On 5 June 2005, Tynecastle Boys Club merged with East of Scotland Football League side Tollcross United to form Tynecastle F.C. This merger meant that Tynecastle were admitted to senior levels of Scottish football for the first time, taking Tollcross United's place in The East of Scotland Football League First Division. Tynecastle's chairman, Douglas Dalgliesh said of the merger: \\"The coming together of the two organisations will be of enormous benefit. Having a team in the East of Scotland Association is seen as another step forward in our plan for growth.\\" Tollcross United secretary, Alastair Wilkie added: \\"For some time now we have struggled to encourage younger players to join and the tie up with such a club as Tynecastle is the only way forward. It is sad that the Tollcross name will disappear after all those years but we need to look to the future and the new set up will allow us to move forward.\\" On 5 August, the club played their first ever senior match, a pre-season friendly against Scottish Premier League side Hibernian. The match ended in a very credible 2–2 draw, thanks to a last minute Tynecastle equaliser. On 5 December 2005, Keith Summers was appointed as the first team manager of the club. He had previously been interim manager for just over a month, following the departure of Ronnie Dignan on 25 October. On 13 November 2007, the club received a windfall of £114,000 after former player and Scotland goalkeeper Craig Gordon was transferred from Hearts to Sunderland for £9 million. Chairman Douglas Dalgliesh said: \\"We thought that if a player was over twenty-three we wouldn't be entitled to any money, so it was a shock to receive this news.\\" He added: \\"We've always lived from year-to-year and month- to-month, but now we have funding like we've never had before.\\" Gordon said of the news: \\"I'm sure it will keep them going for years to come and hopefully it will nurture a few boys through to play in the SPL.\\" In January 2008, the club set up a sister club in the American city of Everett, Snohomish County, Washington called Tynecastle International F.C. It was set up by former Tynecastle and Bolton Wanderers player and resident of Everett, David Hoggan. Under the initiative, young players from the US will be given professional coaching and take to the field in the traditional maroon of their Edinburgh counterparts. In the 2007–08 season, Tynecastle finished 3rd in the East of Scotland League First Division. This was their highest league finish since the team were formed, having previously finished 5th in 2006–07 and 9th in 2005–06. At the start of the 2008–09 season, former Livingston and Gretna striker, David Bingham was appointed as player/coach of the club. He joined former Hearts player Gary Mackay on the coaching staff at Tynecastle. On 16 May 2009, Tynecastle defeated Gretna 2008 4–0 to secure the East of Scotland League First Division title, and as a result were promoted to the Premier Division for the 2009–10 season. In August 2009, Tynecastle was awarded the SFA Quality Mark, which is awarded to show good practice in on and off field matters. Tynecastle also opened the new Fernieside Recreational Ground pavilion with a game against a Heart of Midlothian XI, the new pavilion was given to Tynecastle on a long term lease. Colours and Badge The club's home kit is a maroon design similar to the home kit of Heart of Midlothian, but with a white swoosh across the shoulder. In 2008, the club announced a new sponsorship deal with a local Indian restaurant. It was also announced that they would be playing in a new yellow away kit during the 2008–09. The club's badge displays an image of a castle over the top of large maroon 'T'. To the top of the logo, the words 'Founded 1928' are displayed in a yellow banner and similarly, 'Edinburgh' is displayed in a yellow banner beneath the Logo. The words 'Tynecastle' and 'Club' are written in a maroon text above and below the rest of the badge respectively. Stadium Tynecastle moved to the Meggetland Sports Complex in 2018, where they share the main stadium grass pitch with Boroughmuir RFC. They originally played at the Fernieside Recreation Ground, which had been Tollcross United's home since 1971, before sharing Saughton Enclosure with Lothian Thistle Hutchison Vale from 2015.

Born at Haselbach, in Lower Austria, he studied at the University of Vienna, where he received the degree of Master of Arts in 1412. Until 1427 he was attached to the Faculty of Arts and lectured on Aristotle and Latin grammar. After 1419 he was also admitted to the theological faculty as 'cursor biblicus'. In 1427 he was made licentiate and in 1428 Master of Theology; soon after he became dean of the theological faculty, in which body he was a professor until his death. He was rector of the University of Vienna in 1423, 1429, and 1445; and he was also a canon of St. Stephen's church, and engaged in the apostolic ministry as a preacher and as pastor of Perchtoldsdorf and of Falkenstein near Vienna. He ranks high among the professors of the University of Vienna in the Fifteenth century. In the struggles which it had to sustain, he championed the rights and interests of the university with zeal and energy. He represented the university at the Council of Basle (1432–1434), took an active part in all its discussions, and was one of the delegates sent by the council to Prague to confer with the Hussites. From 1440 to 1444 he was sent to various cities as an ambassador of Emperor Frederick III. He disapproved of the attitude of the Council of Basle towards both pope and emperor, and eventually withdrew from it. His advocacy of the rights of the Vienna University, coupled with the attacks of his opponents, lost him the favour of the emperor, who saw in him a secret enemy. In 1451 and 1452 he was in Italy and went to Rome where he obtained from the pope a confirmation of the privileges of the University of Vienna. In the war between Frederick III and Albert of Brandenburg he tried to act as mediator but only fell into greater disfavour with Frederick. His last years were clouded by the disturbances of the years 1461–1463 during which Austria had much to suffer from the King of Bohemia, George of Podebrady, and from internal conflicts. Historical and Religious Works Ebendorfer is one of the most prominent chroniclers of the Fifteenth century. His \\"Chronicon Austriae\\" is a dull but frank and very detailed history of Austria to 1463. From 1400 on it is an indispensable source of Austrian history (ed. Pez in \\"Scriptores rerum Austriacarum\\", II, Leipzig, 1725, 689-986; in this edition all of Book I and part of Book II were omitted). His account of the Council of Basle appears in the \\"Diarium gestorum concilii Basileensis pro reductione Bohemorum\\" (ed. Birk in Monumenta concilii Basileensis, Scriptores, I, Vienna, 1875, 701-783). He wrote also a history of the Roman emperors, \\"Chronica regum Romanorum\\"; Books VI and VII, which are of independent value as sources, were edited by Pribram in the Mitteilungen des Instituts für österreichische Geschichtsforschung, third supplementary volume (Innsbruck, 1890-1894), 38-222. Many of his writings are as yet unedited, among them commentaries on Biblical books, sermons, \\"Liber de schismatibus\\", \\"Liber Pontificum Romanorum\\" (see Levinson, \\"Thomas Ebendorfers Liber Pontificum\\" in \\"Mitteilungen des Instituts fur osterreichische Geschichtsforschung\\", XX, 1899, 69-99).

Ball was born in Westminster, London, the son of Edward Henry Ball, carver, and his wife Louisa, née Percival. He later studied at the Royal Academy of Arts schools in England winning several gold medals and prizes. Between 1865 and 1882 he exhibited 24 works at Royal Academy exhibitions. Around 1870 Ball travelled to Paris and then to Munich and Rome, where he lived for approximately eight years. His marble sculptures received high praise. Ball came to Sydney, Australia in 1884, seeking a warmer climate to relieve his asthma and bronchitis. After six months there he moved to Melbourne, occupying a studio at Grosvenor chambers from 1889 and completed the statue of Sir Redmond Barry which now stands in front of the public library in Melbourne, as a consequence of the original sculptor, James Gilbert, having died after modelling the statue in clay. Ball was then given other commissions, including the statue of Sir William Wallace at Ballarat; Francis Ormond at Melbourne, and some portrait busts, now in the national gallery at Melbourne. In 1886, he was commissioned to sculpt a marble bust of Bishop James Moorhouse, now at the La Trobe Library. In 1898 he was commissioned by the trustees of the national gallery at Sydney to design a panel for the facade of the building. He completed his relief panel Phryne before Praxiteles and then travelled to England to supervise the casting. His architectural sculpture is also at the Victoria and Albert Museum. He died of heart failure due to asthma and bronchitis in England in 1900.

Yleisradio, 1 May 2017. Helsinki) was a Finnish designer, philosopher and artist, best known for his electronic music compositions and the electronic instruments he has designed. He is considered to have been one of the leading early pioneers of electronic music in Finland. Kurenniemi was also a science populariser, a futurologist, a pioneer of media culture, and an experimental film-maker. Kurenniemi completed the majority of his instruments, electronic compositions and experimental films in the 1960s and 1970s. Between 1962 and 1974, he designed and constructed ten electronic instruments and studio devices when he was working as a volunteer assistant at the Department of Musicology at the University of Helsinki, and as designer at Digelius Electronics Finland Oy, founded in 1970. In addition to the Musicology Department, Kurenniemi also worked as assistant and senior designer at the Department of Theoretical Physics from 1962–73. Kurenniemi earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1968. He subsequently worked as a designer of control systems for industrial robots at Oy W. Rosenlew Ab (1976–78), and as a designer of industrial automation and robotic systems at Nokia’s cable machinery division (1980–86). He also worked as a specialist consultant and Head of Planning at the Science Centre Heureka in Vantaa, Finland (1987–98). Kurenniemi received the Finland Prize of the Ministry of Education and Culture in 2003. In 2004, he was elected honorary fellow of the University of Art and Design Helsinki. 2011 Kurenniemi received Order of the Lion of Finland medal from The President of Finland Mrs. Tarja Halonen. Instrument design Kurenniemi began his career in instrument design at the Department of Musicology in the University of Helsinki during the academic year 1961–1962. At the suggestion of musicology students Erkki Salmenhaara, Ilkka Oramo and Ilpo Saunio, Professor Erik Tawaststjerna invited Kurenniemi to design an electronic music studio for the university. Kurenniemi was also employed by the department as an unpaid voluntary assistant. Kurenniemi's concept for the studio represented a departure from the then prevalent tape editing studios in that it employed digital control technology and automation. The key unit for control, production and editing in 1964–1967 was the so-called integrated synthesizer, the design of which bore a closer resemblance to the 1950s' digital RCA synthesizer than to the voltage-controlled synthesizers of Robert Moog, for instance. In parallel with his work on designing the studio, Kurenniemi also built electronic instruments for customers, including avant- garde artist M. A. Numminen, composer Osmo Lindeman and Swedish composer Ralph Lundsten. Kurenniemi worked on a series of DIMI synthesizers (from DIgital Music Instrument). In 1970, a company called Digelius Electronics Finland Oy was set up to manufacture DIMIs. Kurenniemi's instruments were characterised by the early use of digital control and also the combination of sequencers with synthesizers. Kurenniemi was also the first to use a completely digital design based on calculator circuits to determine the pitch of the synthesised sound. Kurenniemi also explored the use of digital memory in his instruments – his first digital memory was installed in the Dico instrument commissioned by Osmo Lindeman (1969). In addition to developing new applications, Kurenniemi studied the use of different control systems in his instruments. For instance, Dimi-O (1971) is based on an optical interface, the original purpose of which was to read sheet music graphically. The instrument could also be played with a conventional keyboard or via a video camera. Dimi-O was also used in tandem with a dancer, whose movements were transformed into music (see Section 2.2 Film, media and video works). Dimi-O is an early example of an interactive instrument. Inspired by the bio-music of the American composer Manford L. Eaton, Kurenniemi designed instruments based on bio-feedback. These included Dimi-S (also known as Sexophone, 1972), where sound generation is based on the electric conductivity of the skin, and Dimi-T (a.k.a. Electroencephalophone, 1973), where the sound control is based on a signal generated by the electric activity of the brain. Having worked for years in other fields, Kurenniemi resumed the construction of digital instruments in the mid-2000s (decade), when his pioneering work was attracting increasing interest internationally. Together with Thomas Carlsson, a UK-based designer of electronic systems, in 2005, Kurenniemi designed and constructed a new version of the Dimi instrument in which sound generation is based on the theory of mathematical harmonies developed by Kurenniemi since the 1980s (see Section 3. Scientific activity). Dimi-H is a program-based instrument that allows the player to pick out \\"notes out of the air\\" in a camera-generated 3D space. Artistic activity =Music= The most well-known part of Kurenniemi's music production is his electroacoustic compositions, which he realized in the Electronic music studio of the University of Helsinki. Beside his own work, he acted as an assistant to other composers - e.g. Erkki Salmenhaara - and produced material tapes for composers. The well-known compositions of Kurenniemi include pieces such as \\"On-Off\\" (1963) and \\"Andropodien Tanssi\\" (1968) which was partly released on an album of Finnish progressive psychedelic band Wigwam under the title \\"Dance of the Anthropoids\\" (Wigwam: Tombstone Valentine, 1970). Part of Kurenniemi's compositions are realized in a collaboration - e.g. \\"Saharan Uni I & II\\" (1967) with Kari Hakala and \\"Inventio/Outventio\\" (1970) and \\"Mix Master Universe\\" (1973) with Jukka Ruohomäki. Many of the Kurenniemi's pieces are first realized as an equipment testing - e.g. \\"Andropoidien Tanssi\\" (with Andromatic), \\"Improvisaatio\\" (with DICO) and \\"Inventio/Outventio\\" (with DIMI-A). In 2002 Mika Taanila put together a compilation-CD (Äänityksiä/Recordings 1963-73) of Kurenniemi's electroacoustic compositions. =Film, media and video works= Kurenniemi's films comprise 14 experimental 16-mm short films on the themes of nature, the living environment, as well as travelogues, sex and technology. The films were shot in 1964–1971, but their exact completion dates are difficult to determine, as Kurenniemi only showed his work to a few friends at his home. Only one film, Ex nihilo, was presented publicly at the time of its completion, and has therefore been assessed by the Finnish Board of Film Classification. All the others remain, according to Kurenniemi, more or less incomplete sketches. All the films were originally silent, but in 2003 Kurenniemi and Mika Taanila added soundtracks of Kurenniemi's contemporaneous electronic music to six of them. The dates in the filmography are Kurenniemi's estimates of when the editing of the film was finished. From 1972–74, Kurenniemi recorded diary entries on tape cassettes. From the early 1980s onward he kept a constant video and photograph log of his surroundings and personal events, with the aim of producing material for a digital virtual world, to be compiled some time after his death, in which his life would be the central element. =Kurenniemi archives and works in exhibitions= All of Kurenniemi's films and the Dimi-S instrument as well as Master Chaynjis, an early robot from 1982, are today in the collections of the Finnish National Gallery (FNG), the Museum of Contemporary Art Kiasma. His extensive private archive is deposited in the Central Art Archives of the FNG, where it is being catalogued and digitised. Some of Kurenniemi's instruments (integrated synthesizer, Sähkökvartetti, Dico, Dimi-A, Dimix and Dimi-6000) are deposited in the studio of the Musicology Department at the University of Helsinki, and some (Andormatic, Dimi-O and another Dimi-S) are in Ralph Lundsten's music studio Andromeda in Stockholm. Another Dimi-A synthesizer is deposited in the Museum of Music in Stockholm. The Documenta (13) art exhibition in Kassel presented a colorful overview of Kurenniemi's archives and artworks in 2012. Parts of these private and public archives and artist projects were shown also in a solo show at Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki from 2013–14. =Scientific activity= Kurenniemi presented his theory of mathematical music in the article \\"Harmonioiden teoria\\" (\\"Theory of harmonies\\", 1985) and \\"Musical harmonies are divisor sets\\" (1988), in which he defines harmony as a function of the divisor set of an integer. Harmony can be read by interpreting the successive numbers as intervals. Harmonies are symmetrical, that is, their interval relations remain constant regardless of whether the divisor set is read from beginning to end or vice versa. Correspondingly, all intervals and chords can be expanded into a harmony by calculating the greatest common factor of the set, f, and its smallest common divisor, s, resulting in the harmony as H(s/f). In Kurenniemi's theory, both major and minor chords generate the same harmony, which in his view would explain their equal status in Western tonal music. His theory of harmonies abandons traditional scales and octave equivalence, elevating harmonies to the status of natural scales. Kurenniemi also assumes that rhythm follows the same proportions, only below the hearing threshold. Around the start of the 1990s, he wrote yet as unpublished articles concerning a theoretical concept on trivalent networks which he called the Graph Field Theory on space, time and matter.

He was the founder of the Free Church of Tonga and enjoyed significant influence during the reign of George Tupou I, who made him prime minister. Early life Baker was born in London, England, to Jane (née Woolmer) and George Baker. He arrived in Melbourne in 1852 during the Victorian gold rush, as a stowaway. He subsequently worked on the goldfields as a farmhand, miner and apothecary's assistant. In 1855, Baker became a teacher at a Wesleyan school in Castlemaine. He married Elizabeth Powell in 1859. Tonga In 1860, Baker was ordained as a Wesleyan minister and went to Tonga as a missionary. He became head of the mission and was involved in the councils of King George Tupou I, who made him his prime minister in 1880. A disagreement arose with the Wesleyan authorities at Sydney in 1879, and Baker founded an independent body under the title of the \\"Free Church of Tonga\\". Some of the natives, however, were loyal to their original church and much strong feeling was aroused, which resulted with an attempt to shoot Baker in 1887. He escaped unhurt, but his son and daughter were both wounded. Six Tongans were executed for this crime, and many were deported to other islands. In 1888, the Rev. George Brown visited Tonga to inquire into the position and to endeavour to heal the breach between the two churches. He did not succeed, and his reports show that Baker was using his power to the disadvantage of those who were not adherents of the Free Church. In 1890, Sir John Bates Thurston visited Tonga and deported Baker at short notice to Auckland for being 'prejudicial to the peace and good order of the Western Pacific'. Late life Baker lived in Auckland for some years but suffered financial losses in the 1890s slump. Baker paid a short visit to Tonga in 1897, settled there again in 1900, and died there on 16 November 1903. His grave and monument still stand as a tourist attraction in Pangai on Lifuka, Haʻapai. Baker's side of the case may be found in Mennell's Dictionary of Australasian Biography, published in 1892. An opposing view is in Basil Thomson's The Diversions of a Prime Minister, pp. 3 to 25. R. L. Stevenson, who called Baker \\"the defamed and much-accused man of Tonga\\" found him \\"highly interesting to speak to\\" (Vailima Letters, p. 41).

The Chalakkudy River merges with the Periyar River at Elenthikara in the village of Puthenvelikkara. Puthenvelikkara is on the banks of the river Periyar, Chalakudy and Kottapuram lagoon. It is a centre of agricultural production in the region with its many rice paddy fields. Location Puthenvelikkara is situated on a road connecting Paravur with Mala. The nearest town to this village is North Paravur, which is approximately 5 km away and is connected to the village via a rail station named 'Kadavu'. It is located 33 km North from District headquarters Kakkanad, 9 km from Parakkadavu, and 238 km from State capital Thiruvananthapuram. Puthenvelikkara Pin code is 683594 and postal head office is Puthenvelikkara. Blessed with scenic splendor, Puthenvelikara is on the banks of the river Periyar and Chalakudy and Kottapuram Kayal. Lagoons were born out of the influence of natural forces like high tide. History Fossils of sea life, wooden remnants and other debris that came up during digging the town's earth support the theory of its origin. Similar land formed due to high tides can be found at various places in the small state of Kerala. Years ago foreign ships were launched on the north side of Puthenvelikkara and that place is now known as 'Kappalkulam'. Geography Puthenvelikkara is situated in Ernakulam District of Central Kerala in India. The village is 29 km North of Kochi and 21 km west of the Cochin International Airport. The Territory of Puthenvelikkara covers an area of 19.87 km2. Puthenvelikkara shares its borders with Poyya and Methala villages in the North, Karumalloor and Kunnukara villages in the South, Prakkadavu, Kunnukara and Kuzhur villages in the East, and Chendamangalam, Vadakkekara and Methala villages in the West. The ancient belief is that, the formation of the village is a result of high- tide (Veliyettam in Malayalam) and this belief is proven by the existence of fossil of aquatic beings found in the village. Puthenvelikkara is surrounded by water bodies such as rivers and lagoons. It resulted in the formation of fertile lands suited for cultivation. The primary source of income for the people of the village is agriculture. The provinces or wards such as Kurisingal, Kurumba thuruth, Thuruthipuram, Thuruthur, Panjipalla, Manancheri Kunnu, Karottukara, Vattekattu Kunnu, Keezhuppadam, Kodikuthiya Kunnu, Elanthikara, Kanakkankadav, Cherukadappuram, Thelathuruth, Kozhithuruth, Chowkakadav, Malavana, Stationkadav and some small islands, together form the village of Puthenvelikkara. Puthenvelikkara was famous in Paravur for its numerous Kunnu\\\\Hills, but today they have been destroyed for productive purposes in Paravur. The new bridge linking Puthenvelikkara with the mainland was opened to traffic in June, 2018 by Works Minister G Sudhakaran. Built at Valiyapazham-Pallithuruthu, the bridge is a boon to the people of Puthenvelikakra who lacked proper connectivity to nearby areas due to the lack of adequate infrastructure facilities. The Station Kadavu-Valiya Pazham Pallithuruthu bridge had been the long-standing demand of the people of Puthenvelikkara, and the residents can reach Ernakulam and Paravur easily. Following the construction of the bridge, one can reach Chendamangalam and Paravur in just 10 minutes and it will cost them only \`10 by way of bus fare. The construction of the bridge started in 2010.http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2018/jun/26/new-bridge-at- keralas-puthenvelikkara-thrown-open-to-traffic-1833604.html Civic administration Puthenvelikkara belongs to North Paravoor block Panchayat.

A barrister by trade, he embarked on a successful career in South Australian colonial politics, serving as Attorney-General of South Australia from 1870 to 1871 and President of the South Australian Legislative Council from 1893 to 1901 before switching to federal politics after federation. He served as the inaugural President of the Australian Senate from 1901 to 1906. A noted federalist, he was the son of one-time Premier of South Australia John Baker. He was an early proponent of an Australian republic. Early life Baker was born in Adelaide, but returned to his family home of England to study at Eton College and Cambridge University. He was an oarsman in his youth and maintained a keen interest in cricket and horse racing. He graduated with a B.A. in 1864. He was called to the bar in June 1864. Career Parliament House portrait of Baker by Alexander Colquhoun, 1914 Baker began developing a successful career as a barrister, but in 1868, at the age of 26, decided to stand for the state lower house of parliament, the House of Assembly, in the seat of Barossa. The campaign was successful, as he topped the poll, and thus took one of the two Barossa seats in the House of Assembly. Baker earned an M.A. in 1870, and was appointed as Attorney-General in the third ministry of John Hart in May 1870, but returned to the backbenches in July 1871 in order to manage the affairs of his ailing father, and did not recontest his seat at the election late that year. Two years later, Baker visited England, and on his return in early 1875, he declined an offer to serve in the cabinet of Sir Arthur Blyth. He nevertheless recontested his old seat of Barossa, but was defeated. Two years later, Baker chose to instead contest a seat in the Legislative Council, and was successful. He held his seat until federation, serving a twelve-month stint as education minister in the Colton ministry in 1884–1885, and serving as President of the Legislative Council from 1893 until 1901. He founded the National Defence League in 1891 as an immediate response to the perceived threat from the Labor Party. Baker, chairman of the 1897–98 Australasian Federal Convention. Baker took a strong interest in the proposed federation of the Australian colonies in the 1880s and 1890s, and prepared A Manual of Reference to Authorities for the Use of the Members of the Sydney Constitutional Convention, which was published early in 1891 and distributed at the convention of that year. It influenced to some extent the first draft of the Constitution of Australia, which was drawn up as a result of the 1891 convention. Baker continued his involvement throughout the decade, and was elected as a representative of South Australia at the 1897 convention, where he served as chairman of committees and as a member of the constitutional committee. With the onset of federation in 1901, Baker left his post as President of the Legislative Council and chose instead to run for the Australian Senate as a Free Trade Party candidate. He was successful in this move, and when parliament met, was elected as the first President of the Australian Senate. He was re-elected in 1904, and retired from politics in 1906. Personal life On 23 December 1865 he married Katherine Edith Colley (c. 1845–1908), who predeceased him and was survived by two sons (J. R. Baker LLD and R. C. Baker) and a daughter (Miss Edith Baker). Katherine was a daughter of R. B. Colley, first mayor of Glenelg. He was for many years chairman of the jockey club at Morphettville. He had large pastoral interests and was involved in the development of copper mining in the state. He was created a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1886 and was knighted KCMG in 1895.

The adjective \\"absolute\\" is used to stress the distinction with the relative return measures often used by long-only stock fundsAbsolute return – Financial theory – Moneyterms: investment definitions and explanations. Moneyterms. Retriev ed on 2013-10-23. that are not allowed to take part in short selling. The hedge fund business is defined by absolute returns. Unlike traditional asset managers, who try to track and outperform a benchmark (a reference index such as the Dow Jones and S&P; 500), hedge fund managers employ different strategies in order to produce a positive return regardless of the direction and the fluctuations of capital markets.Robert A. Jaeger, \\"All about Hedge Funds\\", Mc Graw Hill, pp.3–4. This is one reason why hedge funds are referred to as alternative investment vehicles (see hedge funds for more details). Absolute return managers tend to be characterised by their use of short selling, leverage and high turnover in their portfolios. Jérôme Teïletche, \\"Les Hedge Funds\\", collection répères, pp.11–13.Robert A. Jaeger, \\"All about Hedge Funds\\", Mc Graw Hill, pp.133–145 and 184–185. Benchmark Although absolute return funds are sometimes considered not to have a benchmark, there is a common one: the funds should do better than short-dated government bonds (e.g. T-bills in the United States). For example, if such \\"cash\\" instruments yield 15%, and the fund returns 5% in that same time period, the fund would be under performing the benchmark. In the case where the cash rate is close to zero, such as the early 2010s decade, this makes little difference. Short selling Suppose that a manager thinks the share price of company A will go down. Then he can borrow 1000 shares of company A from his prime broker and sell them for (say) 10 USD per share. The immediate gain for the manager is 1000\\\\times 10 = 10,000 USD. If (say) after a week the share price of company A drops to 9.5 then the manager buys 1000 shares, paying 1000\\\\times 9.5 = 9,500 USD, and gives the shares back to his prime broker. He thus ends up earning a return of (10,000-9,500)/10,000 = 5\\\\%. If his prime broker asked a 2% interest rate for borrowing the shares then the net gain of the manager is 5\\\\%-2\\\\% = 3\\\\%. Leverage Sometimes a strategy gives a positive return albeit a very small one. Therefore, a manager can use leverage to magnify his return. For example, a long-short manager can deposit 100M with his prime broker in order to buy 200M of shares and simultaneously sell another 200M of shares, which gives a leverage ratio of (200M+200M)/100M = 4. As another example, a manager can borrow money from a country at an interest rate of 2% and reinvest the amount on another country that pays 4%, thus earning the spread 4\\\\%-2\\\\%=2\\\\% (this is called carry trade). If the manager has a leverage ratio of (say) 5 then his return is not 2% but 5\\\\times 2\\\\% = 10\\\\%. However, leverage also amplifies losses: if a manager has a market loss of 3% in his portfolio and a leverage of 4 then his total losses are 4\\\\times 3\\\\% = 12\\\\%. Therefore, even small market losses can be disastrous when there is a huge leverage. According to the OECD, prior to the 2007 crisis, hedge funds in 2007 had an average leverage of 3 whilst investment banks had a leverage above 30. With a leverage of 30, a market loss of 3.3% wipes out the entire portfolio whilst a leverage of 3 gives a total loss of 10%. High turnover Some absolute-return managers are very active with their portfolios, buying and selling shares more frequently than normal investors, because they focus on short-term investment opportunities lasting less than 90 days. Turnover is the rate at which managers rebalance their portfolios, and among other things it depends on the hedge fund's size: in 2008 hedge funds with less than 15M USD in AUM (assets under management) had a 46.9% turnover per month whilst funds with over 250M USD in AUM had only 9.8%.Research Reports – Hedge Fund Reports – eVestment .

It currently has up to 12,000 people in attendance at the main church every Sunday. The church is pastored by Matthew Ashimolowo. Relocation history The church, whose majority membership is under 50 years of age, is predominantly of West African origin but claims that worshippers come from 46 nations. It was located for nine years on a site in Hackney, London, close to the site of the 2012 Olympics Village. KICC had to vacate the site by November 2006 in order to make way for proposed developments for the 2012 London Olympics but did so only in late 2007. The last programme held at the old Hackney site was IGOC 2007, with many international guest speakers. The church relocated to Hoe Street, Walthamstow, awaiting planning consent and the development of a large new site in Rainham, near the A13. However, the government was reluctant to give the required development planning consent. Eventually the church purchased and moved into its present larger site, Prayer City in Chatham, Kent, while retaining use of the Walthamstow site. In subsequent press releases, KICC announced plans and programmes scheduled for Prayer City from 2013 onwards. Charity Commission enquiries Irregularities in the operation of the charity behind Kingsway International Christian Centre (The King's Ministries Trust) has led to it being investigated by the Charity Commission on two occasions. The first investigation started in 2002 and reported in October 2005. This report concluded that there had been serious misconduct and mismanagement in the administration of the charity. At an early stage in the investigation, it was considered that the charity's assets were at risk, and control was removed from the existing trustees and placed in the hands of an independent external company (the accountancy and management consultancy practice KPMG), who regularised the charity's affairs. The Charity Commission reported that senior pastor Matthew Ashimolowo acted as both a trustee and a paid employee of the charity, in contravention of charity law. He had been responsible for approving payments and benefits to himself and his wife, Yemisi, totalling more than £384,000. Benefits received included free accommodation for himself and family, an £80,000 car, purchase of a timeshare in Florida for £13,000 using a charity credit card, and over half a million pounds paid out to Ashimolowo's private companies, which were operated from church property and had unclear business relationships with the charity. £120,000 was spent celebrating Ashimolowo's birthday. He repaid £200,000 to the charity. A second statutory investigation into misapplication of funds was reported to have started in February 2011. The charity had received £10m from the London Development Agency for the compulsory purchase of its property in Hackney wanted for the 2012 Olympics. Subsequently the Commission enquired into £5m given for investment to a former trustee, the former professional footballer Richard Rufus in 2009/10 and 2010/11. Although the trust reported returns from the investment of £1,336,720 in its accounts, the Commission's appointed accountant says that there is doubt about whether the charity would get the original £5m back. The Trust has been told it must obtain written permission from the Charity Commission before making any more investments. The cost of the Charity Commission's running of the first investigation was questioned in the House of Lords by Lord Swinfen during a review of charity law. The three-year-long investigation had cost £1.2 million, chargeable to the charity. Crystal Palace KICC bought a site in Crystal Palace that was previously used as a bingo hall, but planning permission to use it as a church has not been granted. They held a business seminar there on 25 August 2012. The intention is to use it for their South West branch based in Wimbledon, London.KICC SOUTH WEST MOVING TO CRYSTAL PALACE LONDON KICC originally applied for planning permission to change the planning use class of the building from D2 to D1, in order to allow use for religious ceremonies, on 13 August 2009. This application was refused, on two grounds - that the development would result in the loss of an important leisure venue \\"harmful to the social, cultural and economic characteristics of the area\\" and that the wide catchment area for the congregation would attract a large number of cars, resulting in \\"a significant adverse impact on the surrounding area in terms of parking demand and pedestrian safety\\". Despite the planning refusal and opposition from a group of local residents campaigning for the building to be converted into a cinema, KICC performed renovation work inside the building to convert its use from a bingo hall. The building subsequently opened in August 2012. In 2013, over 70 complaints were received by Bromley Council relating to a New Year's Eve event to be held at the venue called \\"Watchnight\\". The council issued KICC a notice under section 330 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to determine the format of the event, and officials visited the event on the night. Bromley's head of licensing confirmed that a public entertainments licence was not required due to the religious content of the event. The council determined that the building had also been used for a religious event falling within use class D1 in February 2013. The chief planner of Bromley was of the view that the irregular nature of the religious events did not constitute a material change of use and suggested at a meeting of planning sub-committee number 1 on 6 February 2014 that Bromley continue monitoring the use of the site and request the owners to submit a new planning application for the intended use. A councillor for Crystal Palace complained that KICC \\"seem to be able to have their cake and eat it\\" and stated that the council \\"...must demonstrate to owners we will enforce planning law if they choose to breach it. We should reject these recommendations and take enforcement action\\". The committee subsequently overturned the planner's recommendation by a vote of 5 to 3, instead giving KICC 30 days to submit a new planning application for mixed D2/D1 use or face enforcement action under planning regulations.

It grows tall and has smooth, hollow stems that bear leaves up to long and wide at their base, which are sharply tapered and bend down at their tips. Like its relative saltmeadow cordgrass S. patens, it produces flowers and seeds on only one side of the stalk. The flowers are a yellowish-green, turning brown by the winter. It has rhizoidal roots, which, when broken off, can result in vegetative asexual growth. The roots are an important food resource for snow geese. It can grow in low marsh (frequently inundated by the tide) as well as high marsh (less frequently inundated), but it is usually restricted to low marsh because it is outcompeted by salt meadow cordgrass in the high marsh.http://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/graminoid/spaalt/all.html USDA Forest Service Fire Effects Information System (FEIS) for Spartina alterniflora It grows in a wide range of salinities, from about 5 psu to marine (32 psu), and has been described as the \\"single most important marsh plant species in the estuary\\" of Chesapeake Bay.Lippson, AJ & RL Lippson. 2006. Life in the Chesapeake Bay, 3rd ed., p.295. Johns Hopkins Press. It is described as intolerant of shade.http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=spal USDA NRCS PLANTS profile for Spartina alterniflora S. alterniflora is noted for its capacity to act as an environmental engineer. It grows out into the water at the seaward edge of a salt marsh, and accumulates sediment and enables other habitat-engineering species, such as mussels, to settle. This accumulation of sediment and other substrate-building species gradually builds up the level of the land at the seaward edge, and other, higher-marsh species move onto the new land. As the marsh accretes, S. alterniflora moves still further out to form a new edge. S. alterniflora grows in tallest forms at the outermost edge of a given marsh, displaying shorter morphologies up onto the landward side of the Spartina belt. S. alterniflora is native to the Atlantic coast of the Americas from Newfoundland, Canada, south to northern Argentina, where it forms a dominant part of brackish coastal saltmarshes. The caterpillars of Aaron's skipper (Poanes aaroni) have only been found on this species to date. Problems as an invasive species Spartina alterniflora can become an invasive plant, either by itself or by hybridizing with native species and interfering with the propagation of the pure native strain. The grass can hinder water circulation and drainage or block boating channels. Meadows of S. alterniflora can crowd out native species, reducing biodiversity and altering the environment; as a result of S. alterniflora growth, invertebrates that live in mud flats disappear as their habitat is overgrown, and in turn, food sources shrink for birds who feed on those invertebrates. One example of an invasive Spartina alterniflora hybrid is that of Spartina anglica. S. anglica is a fertile polyploid derived from the hybrid S.alterniflora × townsendii (S. alterniflora × S. maritima), first found when American S. alterniflora was introduced to southern England in about 1870 and came into contact with the local native S. maritima. S. anglica has a variety of traits that allow it to outcompete native plants, including a high saline tolerance and the ability to perform photosynthesis at lower temperatures more productively than other similar plants. It can grow on a wider range of sediments than other species of Spartina, and can survive inundation in salt water for longer periods of time. S. anglica has since spread throughout northwest Europe, and (following introduction for erosion control) eastern North America. The world’s largest invasion of Spartina alterniflora is in China, where plants from multiple North American locations were intentionally planted starting in 1979 with the intention of providing shore protection and sediment capture. The invasion has spread to over 34,000 hectares in ten provinces and Hong Kong.Strong, D.R. & Ayres, D.R. (2013) Ecological and Evolutionary Misadventures of Spartina, Annu. Rev. Ecol. Evol. Syst. 44: 389–410. In Willapa Bay of Washington state, Spartina alterniflora was probably an accidental introduction during oyster transplants during the nineteenth century and may have dispersed from there to other parts of the state. At its peak of infestation in 2003, it covered approximately 3,000 solid hectares (more than 8,500 acres), spread across an area of 8,000 hectares (20,000 acres). As of 2016, the infestation had been reduced to less than 3 solid hectares (7 acres)https://agr.wa.gov/plantsinsects/weeds/spartina/default.aspx, Washington State Department of Agriculture Spartina Eradication Annual Reports. Accessed 7/12/18.. In California, four species of exotic Spartina (S. alterniflora, S. densiflora, S. patens, and S. anglica) have been introduced to the San Francisco Bay region. Spartina alterniflora is well established in San Francisco Bay, and has had the greatest impact of all the cordgrasses in San Francisco Bay.Ayres, D. R., D. L. Smith, K. Zaremba, S. Klohr, and D. R.

It demonstrated an ability to outcompete the native S. foliosa, and to potentially eliminate it from San Francisco Bay.Callaway, J.C., and M. N. Josselyn. 1992. The introduction and spread of smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) in South San Francisco Bay. Estuaries 15: 218-226. Spartina alterniflora has also been found to hybridize with S. foliosa, producing offspring that may be an even greater threat than S. alterniflora by itself.Anttila, C. K., R. A. King, C. Ferris, D. R. Ayres, and D. R. Strong. 2000. Reciprocal hybrid formation of Spartina in San Francisco Bay. Molecular Ecology 9: 765-770.

Accessed 7/24/12 at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-294x.1999.00679.x/pdf and the hybrid populations have spread into creeks, bays, and more remote coastal locations. The hybrids produce enormous amounts of pollen, which swamp the stigmas of the native S. foliosa flowers to produce even larger numbers of hybrid offspring, leaving the affected native Spartina little chance to produce unhybridized offspring. The hybrids also produce much larger numbers of fertile seeds than the native Spartina, and are producing a hybrid population that, left unchecked, can increase not only in population size but also in its rate of population growth. The hybrids may also be able to fertilize themselves, which the native Spartina cannot do, thus increasing the spread of the hybrid swarm even further. As of 2014, eradication efforts had reduced the infestation of S. alterniflora and hybrids in the San Francisco Bay Area by 96%, from 323 net hectares at its peak to 12 net hectaresKerr et al (2016) A review of 15 years of Spartina management in the San Francisco Estuary, Biol. Invasions 18: 2247-2266.. Several means of control and eradication have been employed against Spartina alterniflora where it has become a pest. Hand pulling is ineffective because even small rhizome fragments that inevitably break off and get left in the soil are capable of sending up new shoots. Imazapyr, an herbicide, is approved for aquatic use and is used effectively in Washington and California to kill it. In Willapa Bay, leafhopper bugs (Prokelisia marginata) were employed to kill the plants, which threaten the oyster industry there, but this method did not contain the invasion. Surveys by air, land, and sea are conducted in infested and threatened areas near San Francisco to determine Spartina's spread.

It is a prequel to Walking with Dinosaurs and was written and directed by Chloe Leland and by Tim Haines and narrated by Kenneth Branagh. It first aired on BBC Three and BBC One in November and December 2005. At the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2006 it won the Emmy Award in the category Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming One Hour or More). Drawing on the knowledge of over 600 scientists, the series depicts Paleozoic history, from the Cambrian Period (530 million years ago) to the Early Triassic Period (248 million years ago), and extinct arthropods, fish, amphibians, synapsids, and reptiles. Episodes The series first aired as a single 90-minute installment on BBC Three, followed by a weekly episodic broadcast on BBC One. The first episode received 4.57 million viewers on BBC One;Weekly top 30 programmes BARB Web. Retrieved 28 September 2018. Viewing figures for the remaining broadcasts did not reach the Top 30 and/or Top 10 Programs. The series has also aired as a two-hour special on the Canadian and American Discovery Channel with an alternate narrator, although Branagh's narration can still sometimes be heard. Unlike previous series, each period begins with \\"tech specs\\" highlighting specific traits of that period; as well as the location based on fossil finds from that period, they also show the period's oxygen content (from up to the Carboniferous)/global temperature (from the Early Permian onwards), and hazards. It also features evolution sequences between periods and looks inside creatures to show new evolutionary traits that humans -within the context of the series- would later adopt (such as the heart of Petrolacosaurus or Euparkeria's hip joint). The major difference is that, similar to Sea Monsters before it, there are only three episodes, each containing two to three segments in time, instead of six full episodes.

Ashimolowo is considered a preacher of the prosperity gospel. Financial irregularities The charity behind Kingsway International Christian Centre is The King's Ministries Trust. This was investigated by the Charity Commission of England and Wales between 2002 and 2005. A report of the inquiry was released in October 2005. The report concluded that there had been serious misconduct and mismanagement in the administration of the charity. At an early stage in the investigation, it was considered that the charity's assets were at risk, and control was removed from the existing trustees and placed in the hands of an independent external company (the accountancy and management consultancy practice KPMG), who regularised the charity's affairs. The report found that: * there was serious misconduct and mismanagement in the administration of the Charity (section 21) * he was responsible for approving payments and benefits to himself and his wife, Yemisi, totalling more than £384,000 (section 11) * he and his family received benefits from the Charity including:  free accommodation for himself and family (section 4)  an £80,000 car (section 12)  he had made personal purchases using the Charity's Visa card, including the purchase of a timeshare apartment in Florida for £13,000 (section 18) * over half a million pounds was paid out to Ashimolowo's private companies, which were operated from church property and had unclear business relationships with the charity (section 15) * Ashimolowo acted as both a trustee and a paid employee of the charity (section 4) He was ordered (section 34) to repay £200,000. In a subsequent debate in the House of Lords, Lord Swinfen questioned the Charity Commission's running of this investigation. He acknowledged the technical breach, but highlighted its openness, \\"This unincorporated trust has for some years been remunerating its trustees for various services and doing so quite openly. It made the mistake of not realising that it should have altered its constitution explicitly to allow that to be done.\\" He then questioned the cost of the investigation \\"With some advice from the commission and the use of the charity lawyer, the trustees of this charity could have affected these changes for some £12,000—one-hundredth of the sum the commission has already spent.\\" He added \\"The commission believes, understandably, that the future success of this charity is assured by the charity having new trustees\\".

After Kahal Chand had built Kahlur Fort the state was named after it. Initially the capital of the state was at a place named Jhandbari — now in Hoshiarpur district — and then it was transferred to Kahlur Fort, but was later moved permanently to Bilaspur by Dip Chand, the 32nd Raja of Kahlur (). Since the 18th-century the rulers of Bilaspur State patronised artists of the Kangra painting style.Hindu Hill Kingdoms V&A; Museum. Bilaspur State came under British protection in 1815 under Raja Mahan Chand and became one of the Simla Hill States. Raja Anand Chand was the last ruler of the princely state and Pandit Sant Ram was the last Home Minister. As Bilaspur acceded to India on 28 October 1948, Bilaspur retained an independent identity as a separate province and as a part-C State of India. The Raja was appointed commissioner of the State. In following years after Raja resigned his deputy Chhabra, who was appointed by govt of India, helped run the temporary govt of Bilaspur while the territory of the princely state was politically integrated into the Indian Union. From 26 January 1950 Bilaspur was administered by the Government of India as a separate C-Class state named Bilaspur State which in 1954 was incorporated into the State of Himachal Pradesh as a province.

Such lodgings are usually at the bottom of, or right beside, the ski hill—hence the term slope side. Due to their proximity to the lifts, and their desirability, slope side units are usually more expensive than off-hill units. Slope side accommodation is desirable for a number of reasons, mainly: * Driving and parking a car at many ski resorts is inconvenient and time consuming. By being slope side, it is possible to avoid the inconvenience and have quicker access to the ski hill. * Skiers staying in slope side lodgings can return to their rooms more easily for a break, or, with kitchen-equipped lodging, to cook and eat lunch. * Those who have finished skiing for the day may return easily without disrupting those who may have accompanied them. Some resorts, such as Mont Tremblant in Quebec, Sun Peaks Resort and Whistler-Blackcomb in British Columbia, feature pedestrian villages at the base of their mountains. Lodgings within these villages are considered slope side by the resorts, as the lifts are within walking distance of each unit. In some cases, the slope side designation is used to describe hotels from which a shuttle bus is required to reach the hill. This is generally seen as stretching the term beyond what may be considered reasonable.

She is editor-in-chief of https://earthsky.org, which presents science news and night sky information. The website served more than 21 million users in 2019, according to Google Analytics.  Early life  On March 1, 1951, Byrd was born in San Antonio, Texas. Byrd's father was Kenneth Byrd, a long-time editor of the now-defunct San Antonio Light. Her mother, Rosetta Schroeder Byrd, was a painter.  Career  With Joel Block, Byrd created the internationally syndicated Earth & Sky radio series in 1991. She served as executive producer and cohost of the daily radio series until 2013, when the radio series ended (although the website continued). Earth & Sky was funded by grants from the National Science Foundation and other sponsors. Byrd wrote, produced and co-hosted – or oversaw the production of – more than 8,000 radio spots in 90-second, 60-second and 8-minute formats, with 13 million daily media impressions for astronomy in English on 1,800+ broadcast outlets, mostly U.S., but also Voice of America to Asia. During these years, Byrd also oversaw the production of video programming on science for YouTube, science programming for children, and audio and video programs in Spanish for Univision. In 1976, Byrd founded the astronomy hot line that, in 1978, became the syndicated astronomy radio series StarDate. Byrd secured the National Science Foundation grants that made StarDate's national distribution possible. She produced StarDate, with host Joel Block, until 1991. StarDate continues, under the auspices of the University of Texas McDonald Observatory. In 1979, Byrd founded of the annual Texas Star Party in the Davis Mountains of West Texas. It remains a week-long astronomy festival, with hundreds of attendees yearly from around the world.TSP History Byrd has won numerous awards from the broadcasting and science communities, including having an asteroid named 3505 Byrd in her honor.

The policy may also be structured to pay out regular income and the payout may also be on the policyholder undergoing a surgical procedure, for example, having a heart bypass operation. The policy may require the policyholder to survive a minimum number of days (the survival period) from when the illness was first diagnosed. The survival period used varies from company to company, however, 14 days is the most typical survival period used. In the Australian market, survival periods are set between 8 – 14 days. The contract terms contain specific rules that define when a diagnosis of a critical illness is considered valid. It may state that the diagnosis need be made by a physician who specialises in that illness or condition, or it may name specific tests, e.g. EKG changes of a myocardial infarction, that confirm the diagnosis. In some markets, however, the definition of a claim for many of the diseases and conditions have become standardised, thus all insurers would use the same claims definition. The standardisation of the claims definitions may serve many purposes including increased clarity of cover for policyholders and greater comparability of policies from different life offices. For example, in the UK the Association of British Insurers (ABI) has issued a Statement of Best Practise which includes a number of standard definitions for common critical illnesses. There are alternative forms of critical illness insurance to the lump sum cash payment model. These critical illness insurance policies directly pay health providers for the treatment costs of critical and life-threatening illnesses covered by the policyholder’s insurance policy, including the fee of specialists and procedures at a select group of high-ranking hospitals up to a certain amount per episode of treatment as set out in the policy. First critical illness product Critical illness insurance was founded by Dr Marius Barnard, with the first critical illness product being launched on 6 October 1983 in South Africa, under the name dread disease insurance. This form of insurance originally covered four primary human health conditions: *Cancer *Stroke *Heart attack *Coronary bypass surgery Since 1983, the cover has been accepted into many insurance markets around the world. Other names of the insurance cover include: trauma insurance, serious illness insurance and living assurance. Conditions covered The schedule of insured illnesses varies between insurance companies. In 1983, four conditions were covered by the policy, i.e. heart attack, cancer, stroke and coronary artery by-pass surgery. Examples of other conditions that might be covered include: *Alzheimer’s disease *Aortic surgery *Aplastic anaemia *Bacterial meningitis *Benign brain tumour *Blindness *Cancer (life-threatening) *Coma *Coronary artery- bypass surgery *Deafness *Heart attack *Heart valve replacement *Kidney failure *Loss of independent existence *Loss of limbs *Loss of speech *Major organ transplant *Major organ failure on waiting list *Motor neuron disease *Multiple sclerosis *Occupational HIV infection *Paralysis *Parkinson’s disease *Severe burns *Stroke (Cerebrovascular accident) Ref: Canada Life Critical Illness Insurance Policy Due to the fact that the incidence of a condition may decrease over time and both the diagnosis and treatment may improve over time, the financial need to cover some illnesses deemed critical a decade ago are no longer deemed necessary today. Likewise, some of the conditions covered today may no longer be needed a decade or so in the future. The actual conditions covered depend on the market need for the cover, competition amongst insurers, as well as the policyholder's perceived value of the benefits offered. For these reasons conditions such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, among others, may become the norm cover provided in the future. Need for critical illness cover Critical illness cover was originally sold with the intention of providing financial protection to individuals following the diagnosis or treatment of an illness deemed critical. Critical illness may be purchased by individuals in conjunction with a life insurance or term assurance policy at the time of a residential purchase, known as a 'bolt-on' benefit. The finances received could be used to: * pay for the costs of the care and treatment; * pay for recuperation aids; * replace any lost income due to a decreasing ability to earn; or even * fund for a change in lifestyle. This insurance can provide financial protection to the policyholder or their dependents on the repayment of a mortgage due to the policyholder contracting a critical illness condition or on the death of the policyholder. In this type of product design, some insurers may choose to structure the product to repay a portion of the outstanding mortgage debt on the contracting of a critical illness, whilst the full outstanding mortgage debt would be repaid on the death of the policyholder. Alternatively, the full sum assured may be paid on diagnosis of the critical illness, but then no further payment is made on death, effectively making the critical illness payment an 'accelerated death payment'. Some employers may also take out critical illness insurance for their employees. This contract would be in the form of a group contract and has become an essential strategy used by employers around the world to both protect their employees financially as well as attract more employees to consider working for the company. Alternative forms of critical illness insurance Typical critical illness insurance products refer to policies where the insurer pays the policyholder a pre-determined lump sum cash payment if the policyholder is diagnosed with a critical illness listed in the policy. However, alternative forms of critical illness cover provide direct payment to health providers to cover the high medical costs in treating critical illnesses such as cancer, cardiovascular procedures and organ transplants. The maximum amount is set out in the insurance policy and defined per episode of treatment. These critical illness insurance products generally pay hospitals directly to avoid policyholder’s incurring out of pocket expenses and lengthy reimbursement processes. In most instances of this alternative to the lump sump critical illness insurance, policyholders may decide where they will receive treatment among a pre-selected group of hospitals. Some forms of critical illness insurance also offer policyholders the option to travel to highly specialised hospitals in other countries to receive treatment. These policies usually include travel and accommodation expenses for the policyholder and a companion, as well as other concierge services such as translators or personal nurses. Assessing risk  Applicants are assessed for risk by a process of underwriting. Underwriting may take place in an automated underwriting computer filtering system. However the most detailed and holistic underwriting is still performed by experienced life insurance underwriters. The underwriting process for critical illness is similar to life insurance underwriting in that it takes into account factors such as age, gender, smoking status, past medical history, family history, alcohol consumption, and body mass index. In the case of critical illness however, there is an increased emphasis on family history, smoking and bodymass index are risk factors that can demonstrate a marked increase risk with respect to critical illness cover. Having underwritten an applicant in full, an underwriter can decide to accept the risk at the standard rate, or they may decide than an extra charge is warranted, or they may decide to apply exclusions of particular illnesses. If there is any amendment by an underwriter to the terms of acceptance, this has to be agreed by the applicant before the policy can proceed to issue. World markets In South Africa, the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, critical illness insurance has become a well established form of insurance. Critical illness insurance continues to grow in popularity and has recently been accepted into other territories including the far east and the United States. In markets where the product is newer, many insurers choose to use the expertise of reinsurers with worldwide exposure as well as overseas insurers who have sold the product for a number of years. The expertise may come in the form of data provided as well as assistance with the product design features of the product. = Australia = Critical Illness insurance, also known as Trauma Insurance in Australia is characterised by lump sum payments for listed medical events. Unlike in the United Kingdom, Trauma Insurance conditions are not standardised and market competition is based on both premium and policy definitions. It is not uncommon for an Australian Trauma Insurance policy to list 40+ definitions, including Cancer, Heart Attack, Strokes. Around 85% of Trauma Insurance claims paid in Australia are for either Cancer or Heart Disease. It is not uncommon for policies to also offer partial payments, if the condition suffered does not meet the full definition required for a full claim payout. Trauma Insurance policies in Australia are most commonly linked to Life Insurance policies, however can be taken as a stand-alone policy and where a Trauma Insurance policy is linked, it will normally deduct the balance of the insured Life Insurance amount. Trauma Insurance policies in Australia when used to provide personal protection, are generally not tax deductible and any claim proceeds are not taxable. Trauma Insurance is not offered in Superannuation as the definitions available for payment do not always align with the required conditions of release. = Canada = Critical illness insurance options available in Canada: * ROP - Return of premium. If you do not claim a critical illness you can request a return of premium as long as you have fulfilled the minimum time period specified within the policy. * ROPD - Return of premium on Death. Your premiums are returned to your estate. The ROPD is an optional * Term CI - Similar to term life insurance, this critical illness insurance increases in premium cost at the start of each new term. A term is generally 10 years. Term CI expires at age 75 (varies by insurance company). * Permanent CI - Permanent critical illness insurance is a level term insurance, which means the premiums do not change. Permanent CI does not expire unless requested by the client, or failure to pay. * Second Event. If there is a second critical illness you receive 50% of the policy benefit over and above the base benefit. Second event is an optional rider. * Waiver of premium. The premium are waived if you are disabled. Waiver of premium is an optional rider. = United States = Currently 5 million policies are in force. Some 1.5 million policies or certificates were purchased in 2018.

In Jan of 2018, Northgate Public Services was acquired by NEC from the private equity firm Cinven Prior to the NEC acquisition the company had more than 5,300 staff in 35 countries. Following the sale of two business divisions, Northgate has only one division: NGA Human Resources. Specialising in services to the public sector, Northgate Public Services was acquired by Cinven in December 2014. Northgate Managed Services, specialising in managed information technology services to the UK mid-market, was acquired by Capita in February 2013. History =Early years= The company was founded as CMC, or Computer Machinery Company Limited, on 18 September 1969 by Ray Parry. They were originally distributors and subsequently manufacturers of key to disk computer systems made by the US-based Computer Machinery Corporation. The CMC key to disk systems were used by companies and government departments for data capture. In 1976, CMC developed a bit-slice based intelligent terminal—the P99—which it used both as a front end processor to the key to disk systems and as a terminal in its own right. It then evolved the CMC P99 into the P141—a true front-end processor, which it used to implement a new data capture system call Sovereign. This was used in manufacturing companies such as Rolls-Royce plc, British Steel Corporation and various government departments including providing data capture for the DHSS at Newcastle upon Tyne. It later evolved into the M8000 system, based on Intel-processor-based systems. In 1976, CMC merged with Microdata Corporation, a California-based computer company, whose 1973-released Reality operating and database environment product CMC was also distributing. The companies continued to use separate trading names in their respective regions until 1981. The Reality name was given to Microdata's computer system and the operating system—a version of the Pick operating system. At the time, Microdata owned rights to the Pick Operating system in parallel with Dick Pick – who had developed it with Microdata. CMC Leasing Limited (the official trading name) then changed its name to Microdata UK limited, aka MUK. The company then started UK manufacture of the Reality range of computer systems in its manufacturing factory in Maxted Road, Hemel Hempstead. Microdata was purchased by McDonnell Douglas Corporation in 1985 and the company was re-branded as McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Limited (MDIS). The company introduced the M9000 (called Sequoia in U.S.) which offered dynamic performance using soft loaded firmware and processor performance keys using the same hardware components to minimise sparing and maximise cost effectiveness, (although 1Mb memory sold for 25,000 GBP in those days). A new manufacturing and office complex was built in Boundary Way, Hemel Hempstead. Work started virtually as soon as the building opened to double its size, so they became known as 'Phase 1 and 2' internally but 'Maylands Park' externally. The company then produced the UK designed Spirit processor which was launched as a lower-end Reality product as the M6000. Later the company developed the Series 19 (aka Pegasus) successor to the Sequoia using a worldwide development team spanning the two engineering facilities in Hemel Hempstead, UK and Irvine, California. In 1989, the second new building, known as Marylands Park South, was completed at Boundary Way to accommodate the thousand staff then at the head office location. At the time, the company was thought to have one of the largest company car fleets in the UK (Hertz). =1990s= 1992 was the last year MDIS made a computer system from scratch, which meant the end of UK manufacturing for the company. It continued its hardware and systems integration work at Maylands Park North. It could do this because it had produced RealityX, an open platform Reality environment (internally known for a time as CORA). This was the result of several years of development taking the Reality operating system (ROS) and re-engineering into a Unix application capable of running on non-MDIS computers. RealityX provided not only end user/application compatibility but also provided it at the developer assembler level. The same source code was used for RealityX and the original Reality implementations. RealityX allowed the Reality operating environment and applications developed for Reality to continue to be sold and maintained under the SeriesX name. Initially MDIS used UNIX systems from Encore Computer, then from Motorola Computer Systems and Data General—all using M88k RISC processors and UnixSystem V. Later they moved to run on Solaris-based systems from Sun Microsystems. The open approach eventually led to a Microsoft Windows platform in 1995 and continued feature enhancements that are still being developed . As a corollary to this operating environment, MDIS acquired and developed its PROIV fourth generation language (4GL), which was used worldwide by companies including Fujitsu. A variant was implemented on REALITY called ALL (Application Language Liberator). In 1993, a management buyout occurred. 29 Senior Managers and Directors of the company, under the leadership of Jerry Causley CEO, and through Barings Bank, purchased the company from McDonnell Douglas. In 1994, the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange under the MDIS banner. Shares were sold, at the flotation, for 260p each. Within two months the shares were worth less than 100p. Through the latter part of the 1990s, most of the original directors and senior managers left the company, to be replaced by a new management group. The new CEO, John Klien, took the reins after the company issued yet another profit warning to the stock exchange. The company's key application products (Human Resources) were re-implemented in PRO-IV to improve product availability and functionality. In 1998, the Maylands Park South Building was sold to 3Com. This complex had accommodated about 600 staff, who were either re-located to the other Maylands Park building or, with others in the group, made redundant. In 1999, Chris Stone was appointed as CEO. At this time the company was losing about £100m per year and several years of downsizing and rationalisation followed. The company re-focused on its core, local Government and Public Sector (police, fire, and ambulance) markets and application products (Payroll, Pensions and HR systems). Services such as hardware maintenance and managed services were also offered. =2000s= in 2000, the company was rebranded to shed the old loss making image, and the company changed its name to Northgate Information Solutions. This was actually the name of a small software house which the old MDIS company purchased years earlier. Through \\"re-focusing\\", and the loss of about two-thirds of the original MDIS staff, the business finally regained profitability in 2001. Through the sale of the Health business unit, the company raised capital for acquisitions. In 2002, Northgate acquired Prolog, payroll outsourcing & solutions. In 2003, To expand core business and to gain access to a wider range of clients, the company acquired CaraPeople, (payroll outsourcing), blue8, (location and citizen centric IT systems for emergency services), Hays CSG, (data management information systems (police) and consulting), PWA Group, (HR applications). In 2004 the company acquired Rebus (previously Peterborough Software), one of its main competitors (HR Group, which provides HR and payroll solutions), and CIM Systems (communication technologies for control room environments). As a result of its larger capitalisation, it became listed on the London Stock Exchange FTSE 250 Index. in 2005 Sx3 and MVM Holdings were acquired, however a number of the old Northgate staff now felt that they were working for Sx3, due to the integration of their senior managers. In June 2007, Northgate bought ARINSO to create NorthgateArinso (NGA) . NorthgateArinso went on to become a global leader in HR services and in 2011 and 2012 was acknowledged as a leader in HR and Payroll Outsourcing by industry analysts such as Gartner, IDC and Everest Research. Private-equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, (KKR) acquired Northgate in November 2007, for £593m. Northgate chairman at the time, Ron Mackintosh said the offer from KKR was good value and he predicted a bright future for the firm under private-equity ownership. In November 2008, Northgate Information Solutions UK Ltd acquired Anite Public Sector Holdings Ltd from Anite plc. Convergys sold its Human Resources Management line of business to NorthgateArinso in 2010. Northgate Managed Services, specialising in Managed IT Services to the UK mid-market, was acquired by Capita in February 2013. Northgate Public Services was acquired by Cinven in December 2014. In 2017, NGA HR (Payroll Service Organization From Northgate Information Solutions) announced that it has sold its UK Mid-Market and UK SME sections to Bain Capital to focus on the growing demand from enterprise businesses for multi country HR and payroll solutions able to support a diverse workforce in the digital economy. It was announced in January 2018 that following Bain Capital's acquisition of NGA HR's UK & Ireland division, they would rebrand as a separate company providing payroll solutions under the new name Zellis. The company acquired APD Communications, a software supplier to the emergency services, public safety and control room markets in January 2019 and the specialist and care division EMIS Health in April 2019. On August 22, 2019 it was announced that Alight Solutions will acquire NGA Human Resources. Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal fire On Sunday, 11 December 2005, a major explosion and fire at the Buncefield oil depot immediately adjacent to the NIS building, effectively destroyed the Hemel Hempstead Head office complex. The two managed services staff manning the Data Centre escaped unharmed. Other Hemel Hempstead based staff were told to report to offices in Oxford and Peterborough the following week. The share price dipped on the first trading day afterwards, but recovered by lunchtime. The company had a well-practised disaster recovery programme, and the company moved its Managed Services customer system backups (which were stored off-site) to run on systems based at a site in Hounslow, where a number of Northgate staff ran these during the next few months. This included a full managed network for hospitals in East Anglia. Despite this taking place in December, when payrolls are usually run earlier than normal, every payroll for all Northgate's customers was run on time. The company became known as one that had successfully passed through a major physical disaster, and CEO Chris Stone was invited to speak at various venues on commercial disaster recovery. In October 2006, the share price fluctuated, and the company announced that they were subject to an unsolicited takeover approach. It has since been announced that this has amounted to nothing. In December 2007, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts agreed to buy the company for £593 million. In March 2008, Northgate Information Systems plc was de-listed from the London Stock Exchange following completion of the purchase by KKR. The next month, Northgate achieved a position of forty-seventh out of one hundred in 'Britain's Top Employer 2008'. Northgate Public Services was acquired by Cinven in December 2014. Northgate Managed Services, specialising in Managed IT Services to the UK mid-market, was acquired by Capita in February 2013.

It was one of the earliest commercial systems outside the \\"big iron\\" companies such as CompuServe or The Source, and survived into the 1990s before being overwhelmed by the Internet and closing down. CRS was founded by Jud Newell in 1979 as Mississauga RCP/M, a small one- line system running on RCP/M that later became Toronto RCP/M after a move. It became CRS when Newell decided to make the growing system a full-time job in 1985, moving to the then top-of-the-line PCBoard system and moving to DOS from CP/M. It grew over the next few years to become one of the first really large BBS systems, which allowed its users to carry on conversations with thousands of local residents. At the time the average BBS system was run on a single 300 or 1200 baud modem and had extremely limited storage space for messages or files (hard drives were not yet common). At the other end of the scale, larger online services offered thousands of files and messages, but at a fairly high per-hour cost. CRS offered a practical \\"middle ground\\" between the expensive mainframe systems and the local BBS, both in terms of pricing and features. During the late 1980s the growth of the FidoNet upset this balance somewhat. Now a user could call into their local free BBS system and have conversations with users from all over the world—although practically this was limited to North America. PCBoard did support a Fido-like system known as RelayNet (or RIME), but this was supported by PCBoard only and thus had a much smaller amount of traffic than the platform independent Fido. For some time CRS offered RelayNet hub service known as NAnet to other PCBoard operators throughout North America in order to increase the user base, going so far as to offer a 1-800 number for these BBSes to call in on. CRS's file area remained its major draw, with a library hosted on a number of networked servers that no small BBS could hope to match. Through the late 1980s and into the 1990s they added considerable amounts of storage and greatly improved modem speeds. In 1992 they could claim to be the largest PCBoard system in the world with over 250 lines and about 10,000 paid members. Throughout this period their main competitor was another Toronto PCBoard based system, Rose Media, but Rose remained smaller at about 50 lines. However their aggressive growth was also expensive, and forced the company into receivership in August 1990, with a sizable debt primarily owed to Bell Canada. A group of private investors then purchased the system and restarted the company. By 1991 Jud had left the company. He was briefly involved with the formation of Toronto Free- Net before eventually leaving the industry. In 1992, CRS changed its name to CRS Online and added another BBS system aimed at online chat, which PCBoard did not support very well, at least in large multi-machine installations. In late 1994, CRS introduced a Windows-based Internet access service called Frontier that incorporated standard Internet functions including email, news and gopher, as well as access to its large file library. In March 1995, CRS was acquired by Delrina to serve as the foundation of Delrina's push into the services market. However, within months of this acquisition, Delrina was itself acquired by Symantec, a US-based software company with little interest beyond Delrina's core software products, notably WinFax. In January 1996 CRS Online was purchased by a growing internet service provider, iStar Internet. It appears their interest was primarily in CRS's customers, which it quickly absorbed into its standard Internet access offerings. CRS itself quickly disappeared.

He attended the Johanneum Gymnasium, and afterwards studied literature 1921–23 at the University of Heidelberg. While still a student he became apprenticed in the family company, Landfried Coffee. In 1923, after two years in Heidelberg learning about the coffee trade and attending lectures at the university on Greek art and literature, List traveled for the family business Kaffee-Import Firma List & Heineken, Hamburg.Biography at glbtq.com Between 1925 and 1928 he visited plantations and contacts in Guatemala, Costa Rica, San Salvador, Brazil (where he stayed for six months) and San Francisco. During this time he began taking photographs.  Photographer  In 1929 he met Andreas Feininger who inspires his greater interest in photography and who gives him a Rolleiflex camera. From 1930 he began taking portraits of friends and shooting still life, is influenced by the Bauhaus and artists of the surrealist movements, Man Ray, Giorgio De Chirico and Max Ernst, and creates a surrealist photograph titled Metaphysique in a style he called fotografia metafisica in homage to De Chirico, his most important influence during this period. He used male models, draped fabric, masks and double-exposures to depict dream states and fantastic imagery. He has explained that his photos were \\"composed visions where [my] arrangements try to capture the magical essence inhabiting and animating the world of appearances.\\" While there are surface similarities to Nazi imagery of the athletic male body—that of Leni Riefenstahl for example—unlike them, List's pictures of friends are portraits as much as they are nudes, and List certainly did not endorse Nazi ideas, and nor did his work influence National Socialist photography, since he never dared publish any male nudes in his own lifetime, and kept them hidden in his mother's house in a sack he called his 'poison bag'. He was however influenced in his depiction of romantic paganism by the Jugendbewegung youth and physical health movement, though he did not join any of its associations, and some of the ideals of the Jugendbewegung were co-opted by the Nazis (though they later denounced the movement) and influenced their idealising Romantic realism.Harry Oosterhuis (1992) Male Bonding and Homosexuality in German Nationalism, Journal of Homosexuality, 22:1-2, 241-255, DOI: 10.1300/J082v22n01_27 List in his own notes uses a pun—\\"Das Objektiv ist nicht objectiv,\\"—to emphasise his creative, non-realist, application of photography: \\"The lens is not objective. Otherwise photography would be useless as an artistic medium.\\"Herbert List 'Photografie als künstlerisches Ausdrucksmittel' in List, H. (1985). Herbert List. München: Christian Verlag., p. 36. In 1936, in response to the danger of Gestapo attention to his openly gay lifestyle and his Jewish heritage, List left Germany for Paris, where he met George Hoyningen-Huene with whom he travelled to Greece, deciding then to become a photographer. During 1937 he worked in a studio in London and held his first one-man show at Galerie du Chasseur d'Images in Paris. Hoyningen-Huene referred him to Harper's Bazaar magazine, and 1936–39 he worked for Arts et Metiers Graphiques, Verve, Vogue, Photographie, and Life. List was unsatisfied with fashion photography. He turned back to still life imagery, continuing in his fotografia metafisica style. From 1937 to 1939 List traveled in Greece and took photographs of ancient temples, ruins, sculptures, and the landscape for his book Licht über Hellas. In the meantime he supported himself with work for magazines Neue Linie, Die Dame and for the press from 1940–43, and with portraits which he continued to make until 1950. In List's work the revolutionary tactics of surrealist art and a metaphysical staging of irony and reverie had been honed in on the fashion industry that relied on illusion and spectacle which after World War II returned to a classical fixation on ruins, broken male statuary and antiquity.Jennifer V.

Ewing, Josef Astor Aperture 122: The Idealizing Vision : The Art of Fashion Photography, Issues 122–125, Aperture Foundation, 1991 he was not allowed to publish or work professionally. In 1944 he was drafted into the German military, despite being of partly Jewish ancestry. He served in Norway as a map designer. A trip to Paris allowed him to take portraits of Picasso, Jean Cocteau, Christian Bérard, Georges Braque, Jean Arp, Joan Miró, and others.  Photojournalism  After the war, he photographed the ruins of Munich where he continued to live until 1960, working mainly for the magazine Du, with freelance photo essays for Heute, Epoca, Look, Harper's Bazaar, Flair, and Picture Post. He was made art editor of Heute magazine, published by the Allied occupying forces, in 1948. In 1951, List met Robert Capa, who invited him to work as a contributor to Magnum, but he rarely accepted assignments.Magnum Photos official website entry for List For the next decade he produced copious work in Italy. During this time he also started using a 35 mm film camera and a telephoto lens. He was influenced by his Magnum colleague Henri Cartier-Bresson as well as the Italian neorealist film movement. In the 1950s he also shot portraits of Marino Marini, Paul Bowles, W. H. Auden, and Marlene Dietrich in 1960. Over the period 1949–62 he visited Italy, Greece, Spain, France, Mexico, and the Caribbean. List's 1950 picture of a woman, her black dress spread about her, reclining at a respectable distance from an elderly man reading, with one leg of his trousers rolled above his socks and garter, both enjoying the spring sunshine on the front steps of the Glyptothek in Munich, was selected by curator Edward Steichen for the world-touring Museum of Modern Art exhibition The Family of Man, seen by 9 million visitors.  Recognition and legacy  In 1964 List was awarded the David Octavius Hill Prize of the Gesellschaft Deutscher Lichtbildner. List is best known for his book Jünge Manner (1988) which contains more than seventy images of young men lounging in the sun, wrestling and innocently regarding the camera lens. It is introduced by Stephen Spender in whose autobiographical novel The Temple, written in 1929 but not published until 1988, List is fictionalised as Joachim Lenz.Scheler, M. (1991).

By 1990, RelayNet comprised more than 200 bulletin board systems. BBS's on RelayNet communicated via a communications protocol called RIME (RelayNet International Mail Exchange). RelayNet was similar to FidoNet in purpose and technology, although it used names for its nodes instead of Fido's numeric address pairs. Due to it being limited to PCBoard, it carried a much smaller amount of traffic than Fido. RIME was built up, starting in 1988, from a master hub owned by Bonnie Anthony, a local Psychiatrist, in Bethesda, Maryland and a subordinate hub owned by her brother, Howard Belasco, in The Bronx, New York. Kip Compton, in high-school at the time, played an important role in the software's development and evolution. PCBoard, created by Clark Development Corporation (CDC) in Salt Lake City, Utah, was always a \\"premium\\" BBS system and fairly expensive. For this reason it was limited mostly to larger multi-line BBS systems, where it was particularly well liked due to its \\"nice\\" behaviour on the network when running off a common file server. However this also meant that the PCBoard market generally consisted of a small number of large systems, as opposed to a large number of small ones, hence RIME had usually only a few hundred member boards. Thus RelayNet, which originally ran only on PCBoard, did not have the same level of infrastructure as FidoNet, and didn't build the sort of global organizational structure that FidoNet needed. Instead, RelayNet evolved as a series of smaller regional networks, including the NANET hosted by Canada Remote Systems, RoseNet hosted by their competitors Rose Media, QuebecNet, FINET, Smartnet, Intelec, Ilink, U'NI-net, Friendsnet and others. RelayNet software later appeared for a variety of other BBS systems, including RBBS, GAP, EIS, QBBS and Wildcat! BBS, but these systems also provided excellent FidoNet support and RelayNet was never popular on anything other than PCBoard and its close competitor, RBBS-PC. On August 1, 2007, Don Barba, owner since the late 1990s of the RIME network, its software, and since the late 1980s of Moondog, its central BBS in Brooklyn, New York, announced that all would close on August 15.

It stars Karl Malden, James Franciscus, and Catherine Spaak.Luther-Smith,Adrian (1999). Blood and Black Lace: The Definitive Guide to Italian Sex and Horror Movies. Stray Cat Publishing Ltd. p. 20 Although it is the middle entry in Argento's so-called \\"Animal Trilogy\\" (along with The Bird with the Crystal Plumage and Four Flies on Grey Velvet), the titular \\"cat o' nine tails\\" does not directly refer to a literal cat, nor to a literal multi-tailed whip; rather, it refers to the number of leads that the protagonists follow in the attempt to solve a murder. Though unsuccessful in Europe, it was acclaimed in the United States. Argento admitted in the book Broken Mirrors, Broken Minds: The Dark Dreams of Dario Argento that he was less than pleased with the film, and has repeatedly cited it as his least favorite of all of his films.  Plot  Franco \\"Cookie\\" Arnò, a middle-aged blind man, is out at night walking with his niece Lori when he overhears a man in a parked car mention blackmail. After Franco and Lori return home, the man gets out of his car and breaks into a large medical complex, the Terzi Institute. The following day, the police and reporter Carlo Giordani investigate the break-in, Carlo introducing himself to Franco during a run-in. Meanwhile, Dr. Calabresi looks at his files in his office and phones someone who agrees to meet with him. Calabresi tells his fiancée, Bianca Merusi, that he knows who broke into the institute and what was taken, but doesn't wish to tell anyone yet, saying it could mean a \\"big step forward\\". At a train station, while a group of reporters are waiting for a celebrity to arrive by train, someone approaches Calabresi and pushes him onto the tracks. Lori reads the newspaper for Franco about Calabresi's \\"accidental death\\", describing the picture and telling him that Giordani wrote the article. The two of them go to see the reporter at his office and ask if the picture has been cropped. Carlo calls up Righetto, the paparazzi photographer who snapped the picture. Righetto goes back to the original and sees a moving hand in the far left of the frame. As Righetto prepares to print the photograph, he is strangled to death with a cord. The killer takes the photo, along with all the negatives, and leaves. Carlo, Franco, and Lori arrive and find the body, calling the police led by Chief Investigator Spimi. Carlo and Franco survey the Institute from a distance, the former looking through a pair of binoculars while describing the people leaving the building to Franco: Mombelli, Esson, Casoni, and Braun, as well as Professor Fulvio Terzi and his daughter Anna. Carlo goes to the Terzi home and expresses his desire to talk about Calabresi's \\"accident\\". Afterwards, Carlo speaks with Anna while evading her questions of what he and her father spoke about. The two drive away together, but soon realize they are being followed by police and drive at full speed to evade them. Meanwhile, Franco and Lori go to talk with Bianca, and she says that she couldn't find anything in the house relating to her fiancé's death. At a local restaurant, Anna tells Carlo about the institute's research of \\"chromosome alteration\\" and \\"XYY\\", the extra Y producing a \\"criminal tendency\\" in a person. Carlo goes to see Dr. Braun at the St. Peter's Club and talks to him about someone being after the institute's secret drug, news that doesn't seem to vex the doctor. Bianca takes a taxi to Calabresi's parked car in a lot. Inside, she finds a tiny note with the details of his fatal appointment at the station. She tapes the note to the inside of her locket. Bianca calls Franco and says she knows who killed Calabresi, but will only tell him in person. As Bianca returns to her apartment, the killer attacks and strangles her with a cord. The killer rummages through her purse, but doesn't find anything. Franco shows Carlo a note he received in which the killer threatens them. Carlo tells Franco he found out that Casoni was fired from his last job, and Braun seem to be living the good life. Carlo goes to see Casoni and the doctor talks about the institute's \\"wonder drug\\" and the \\"XYY pattern\\". Carlo then asks Dr. Mombelli about XYY, and the doctor says that everyone in the institute was tested, but their results are confidential. The killer approaches Carlo's front door and injects two milk cartons, dropped off by the local milkman, with a syringe. Carlo arrives home and brings the milk cartons inside. Anna arrives shortly thereafter and they talk more about the research, as well as her results of the XYY test. They end up having sex. Afterwards, Carlo pours a glass of milk from one of the cartons when Franco phones him saying that someone tampered with the gas line on his stove, flooding his apartment with methane gas and also may try to kill Carlo. Carlo notices the milk that had bled through the hypodermic needle holes and knocks the glass away from Anna before she can drink it. The following day, Carlo meets with one of his old friends and informants, Gigi, for help in investigating the Terzi break-in which may have been an inside job. Carlo and Gigi break into Terzi's house and discover that Anna is adopted and (via a diary) that Terzi \\"adored\\" the woman. Carlo goes to the police station and learns from Spimi that Bianca often met with Braun and that the cops cannot find the doctor. Carlo runs a story in the newspaper about Braun being a suspect in the break-in, and a former gay lover of Manuel (Braun's new lover) approaches Carlo with information on where Braun is hiding. Carlo goes over to the apartment where he's attacked by Manuel. Carlo wins the fight, and sees Braun lying dead on the couch. A few days later, Franco contacts Carlo about Bianca's locket and suggests that the note that she found might still be there. Franco and Carlo head to the cemetery and open Bianca's family crypt. Carlo gets her coffin open while Franco waits by the door. Carlo finds the locket and discovers the note behind a metal plate and hands it to Franco. As Carlo closes the coffin, the killer shuts the crypt door, locking him inside, and attacks Franco. The killer takes the note, but Franco stabs him with his walking cane (which has a knife hidden inside it). While Franco reopens the door to let Carlo out, Lori is hit on the head by the killer and put in the back of a car. Franco and Carlo find the taxi which the killer rode in and discover blood on the back seat. The killer calls Franco and tells him to stop investigating the break-in/murders or otherwise he will kill Lori. Carlo goes to the police to report the kidnapping and they go to the Terzi house. During their visit, Anna comes downstairs with a cloth wrapped around her hand. Carlo tells Anna he knows about her incestuous relationship with her adoptive father and expresses suspicion about the milk incident (Anna had the glass of poisoned milk for some time without drinking it). But Anna claims that she only cut her hand on a broken vase and was nowhere near the cemetery. Then, Terzi arrives and confirms her story. Carlo and the police arrive at the Terzi Institute and search the place for Lori, but they find nothing. However, Carlo sees blood dripping from the ceiling in one of the rooms. He climbs up to the roof and finds Casoni, who hits Carlo in the face before kicking him to the ground. Casoni, with a stab wound to his stomach, goes to a back room where a bound and gagged Lori is and prepares to stab her. Carlo runs in and tackles Casoni, but is stabbed in the chest. The police arrive on the roof and chase Casoni. Franco stops him with his cane blade and Casoni confesses that he murdered Calabresi and the others to cover up that he tested positive for the XYY chromosome and that Calabresi was attempting to blackmail him. When Franco asks about Lori, Casoni tells Franco that he killed her. Enraged, Franco swings his cane at Casoni, knocking him through a sky window and down an elevator shaft to his death, just as a now- free Lori calls out for Franco. The ending is left ambiguous.

However, because the production was set up on the basis of the first 40 pages of the script, and those pages were all written by Argento, Argento demanded that he receive sole screenplay credit. Being credited for story alone meant a substantial pay cut for Sacchetti, so this set off a bitter and publicized dispute between Sacchetti and Dario and Salvatore Argento (the film's producer, and Dario's father).

Adebayo's debut novel, Some Kind of Black, centred on the youthful adventures of its protagonist, Dele, was one of the first to articulate a British-born African perspective, and it won him numerous awards, including the Writers' Guild of Great Britain's New Writer of the Year Award, the Author's Club First Novel Award, the 1996 Saga Prize, and a Betty Trask Award.Kieran Meeke, \\"Guilty Pleasures – Diran Adebayo\\" , Metro, 27 October 2009.

His follow-up, the fable My Once Upon A Time, set in a near-future London-like western city, fused noir with Yoruba folklore to striking effect, and solidified his reputation as a groundbreaker.

Alexander Vasiliev. Alexander Alexandrovich Vasiliev (; 4 October 1867 (N.S.) – 30 March 1953) was considered the foremost authority on Byzantine history and culture in the mid-20th century. His History of the Byzantine Empire (vol. 1–2, 1928) remains one of a few comprehensive accounts of the entire Byzantine history, on the par with those authored by Edward Gibbon and Fyodor Uspensky. Vasiliev was born in Saint Petersburg. He studied under one of the earliest professional Byzantinists, Vasily Vasilievsky, at the University of St Petersburg and later taught Arabic language there. Between 1897 and 1900, he furthered his education in Paris. In 1902, he accompanied Nicholas Marr in his trip to Saint Catherine's Monastery in Sinai. During his stay at the Tartu University (1904–12), Vasiliev prepared and published a highly influential monograph, Byzantium and the Arabs (1907). He also worked in the Russian Archaeology Institute, established by Fyodor Uspensky in Constantinople. In 1912, he moved to the St Petersburg University as a professor. He was elected to the Russian Academy of Sciences in 1919. In 1925, during his visit to Paris, Vasiliev was persuaded by Michael Rostovtzeff to emigrate to the West. It was Rostovtzeff who ensured a position at the University of Wisconsin–Madison for him. Several decades later, Vasiliev moved to work in Dumbarton Oaks. Towards the end of his life, he was elected President of the Nikodim Kondakov Institute in Prague and of the Association Internationale des Études Byzantines.

Some of them are also used in whist, bid whist, the obsolete game auction bridge, and other trick-taking games. This glossary supplements the Glossary of card game terms. : In the following entries, boldface links are external to the glossary and plain links reference other glossary entries. 0–9 ;3014 or 3014 RKCB: A mnemonic for the original (Roman) response structure to the Roman Key Card Blackwood convention. It represents \\"3 or 0\\" and \\"1 or 4\\", meaning that the lowest step response (5) to the 4NT key card asking bid shows responder has three or zero keycards and the next step (5) shows one or four. ;1430 or 1430 RKCB: A mnemonic for a variant response structure to the Roman Key Card Blackwood convention. It represents \\"1 or 4\\" and \\"3 or 0\\", meaning that the lowest step response (5) to the 4NT key card asking bid shows responder has one or four keycards and the next step (5) shows three or zero. ;1RF: One round force. ;2-under preempts: A 2 or 3-level conventional opening bid made two steps below the opener's suit: for example, 2 to show a weak two bid in spades or 3 to show a three-level preempt in hearts. If 2 is a strong, artificial force, 2 is natural. ;4SF: Fourth suit forcing. ;8421: Counting points by way of 8421 means counting an ace for 8 points, a king for 4, a queen for 2, and a jack for 1 point. For example, when a bid is interpreted as \\"5- 8421 HCP in S\\", this means the bidder is expected to have 5 or fewer points in spades, counting an ace as 8 points, etc. A Rubber Bridge Scoring ;Above the line: In rubber bridge, the location on the scorepad above the main horizontal line where extra points are entered; extra points are those awarded for holding honor cards in trumps, for bonuses for scoring game, small slam, grand slam or winning a rubber, for overtricks on the declaring side and for undertricks on the defending side and for fulfilling doubled or redoubled contracts. Points awarded for contract odd tricks bid and made are entered below the line. See Bridge scoring. ;ACBL: American Contract Bridge League, the sport governing body for bridge in North America – defined as Bermuda, Canada, Mexico, and the United States – and the sponsoring organization of North American Bridge Championships (NABC). Its members are players, grouped in regional districts and local units for some purposes. Contrast USBF. ;Acol: An approach–forcing, natural bidding system, based on a weak NT and 4-card majors, popular in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth. ;Active: # An approach to defending a hand that emphasizes quickly setting up winners and taking tricks. Contrast Passive. # An approach to competitive bidding that emphasizes frequent interference with opponents' bidding sequences. ;Adjusted score: In duplicate bridge, a score awarded by the Director (when empowered by the Laws) in order to redress damage to a non- offending side and to take away any advantage gained by an offending side through an infraction. It may be \\"assigned\\" (weighted to reflect the probabilities of a number of potential results) or \\"artificial\\" (otherwise). The scores awarded to the two sides need not balance. ;Advance cue bid: The cue bid of a first round control that occurs before a partnership has agreed on a strain. ;Advance sacrifice: A sacrifice bid made before the opponents have had an opportunity to determine their optimum contract. For example: 1 - (1) - Dbl - (5). ;Advancer: Overcaller's partner, especially one who bids following the overcall. ;Adverse vulnerability: Vulnerable against non- vulnerable opponents. Also called \\"unfavorable vulnerability\\". ;Aggregate scoring: Deciding the outcome of a contest by totaling the raw points gained or lost on each deal. Also called \\"total point scoring\\". ;Agree: For a partnership to come to a decision, explicitly, conventionally or by implication, on the denomination in which to play a hand. ;Agreement: An understanding between partners as to the meaning of a particular call or defensive play. There are two types of call agreements: (1) when the call is natural, the agreement is said to be a treatment, and (2) when the call is artificial, the agreement is said to be a convention. ;Air, as \\"on air\\" : : (Slang) To win a trick with a high card while capturing only small cards, commonly said of a defensive play. In the example at right, when South leads the 8, West must take the A on air, or risk making no heart tricks. Nevertheless, best defense on a given hand may call either for ducking the winner or for playing it on air. ;Alcatraz coup: Declarer's intentional and unethical attempt to locate a finessable card by revoking. If the play is unintentional, it is nevertheless subject to score adjustment. ;Alert: A method of informing the opponents that partner's call carries a meaning they might not expect. Sponsoring organizations set rules on which calls must be alerted and how; any method of alerting may be authorized, such as saying \\"Alert\\", displaying an Alert card from a bidding box, or knocking on the table. Regardless whether a call is alerted, either opponent may ask its meaning, either at his/her turn or after the end of the auction. The player who made the call may contribute to its explanation only after the auction and only if he/she is declarer or dummy. Slightly different rules apply when screens are in use. ;Announcement: A method of promptly informing the opponents that partner's call has a particular meaning. The purposes of announcements and alerts are similar, but an announcement gives the meaning where an alert may prompt the opponents to ask the meaning. Sponsoring organizations set rules on which calls should be announced. The ACBL specifies announcements including \\"Transfer\\" for some transfer replies to notrump bids, the point range such as \\"15 to 17\\" for an opening bid of one notrump, and \\"Forcing\\" or \\"Semi-forcing\\" for a 1NT response to a major suit opening bid. ;Antipositional: A call is antipositional if it tends to make the \\"wrong\\" partner the declarer. If West opens the bidding, it may be best for South to declare a North-South contract, so that West will have to play from his high cards on opening lead. This positioning may protect South's tenaces. In that case, a call that will make North declarer is antipositional. See wrongside. ;Appeal: In tournaments, to appeal is to request that a committee review a ruling made by a director. ;Approach–forcing: A principle, first used in the Culbertson system, that has survived in modern bidding. The original idea was to abandon the indiscriminate notrump bids that characterized auction bridge in favor of a slower exchange of information via suit bidding. ;Arrow: A marker, usually a large card with an arrow on it, that shows which direction is treated as North at a table in a duplicate event. ;Arrow switch: The action of changing the North direction during an event, typically for the last round of a Mitchell movement, so that the pairs who were North-South become East- West and vice versa. This allows a single winning pair to be determined. ;Artificial: # A call that is not natural which by agreement carries a coded meaning not necessarily related to the call's (or to the prior call's) denomination. # A bidding system that contains many such calls. ;Asking bid: A bid that, by prior agreement, requests information about a feature of partner's hand: for example, number of controls, suit length, or control of a particular suit. ;Attacking lead: A lead that instigates an active defense; often, the lead of an honor from a sequence, or a forcing defense. ;Attitude: A defender's desire, or lack thereof, for his side to continue playing a suit. By means of signals, defender encourages or discourages the continuation of the suit. ;Auction # See bidding. # Auction bridge, an earlier form of bridge, differing from today's contract bridge chiefly in the scoring. Most notably, overtricks counted the same as tricks bid and made, so they were scored below the line and any contract, no matter how low, could produce a game or slam bonus. ; Austrian System :Another name for Vienna System. Autobridge, a device for learning bridge ;Autobridge: A variant of contract bridge for play by one person; alternatively, a means for one to learn or practice the game alone. Information for each deal is pre-printed on one sheet of paper in a special layout. Such a \\"deal\\" is loaded in a mechanical template (see image at right) which the operator-player manipulates selectively and sequentially to reveal some of the information. Paper deals are distributed in numbered sets of \\"Autobridge Refills\\". ;Automatic squeeze: A squeeze position that succeeds against either opponent. Compare with Positional squeeze. ;Average # In matchpoint scoring, one-half the matchpoints available on a given deal. # An average score is sometimes awarded to one or both pairs when for some reason they cannot play the board. If neither pair is at fault or both pairs are at fault, the director may decide to award an average to each side. Law 12.C.2 of the Laws of Duplicate Contract Bridge states that if one pair is at fault, it receives an average-minus (at most, 40% of the available matchpoints on the board). A pair not at all at fault receives average-plus: 60% of the available matchpoints on the board, or, if greater, the average of the matchpoints the pair earned on other boards played during the session or of the matchpoints earned against their current opponents. The assigned scores need not sum to the total available matchpoints. # In IMP (Butler) pairs, \\"average\\" refers to the \\"datum\\" used in scoring. ;Avoidance play: A play designed to keep a particular defender off lead, often to prevent the lead of a suit through a tenace position in either declarer's hand or dummy. B ;Back in: To make a partnership's first bid, having previously passed. For example, in 1 - (P) - 1NT - (P); 2 - (Dbl), the doubler has backed into the bidding. ;Backward finesse: A combination of two finesses in a suit such that the first finesse is \\"backward\\": that is, leading away from the hand containing the tenace. ;Balance: To keep the bidding open when it is about to be passed out at a low level. For example, if the bidding goes 1 - (P) - P - (1NT), the 1NT bid is a balancing action. The balancing bid is often made with a hand of substandard strength in order to prevent the opponents from securing a low-level contract. ;Balanced distribution # Narrowly, a balanced distribution of a hand is 4-3-3-3, 4-4-3-2 or 5-3-3-2. Equivalently, there are no voids, no singletons, and at most one doubleton. # Balanced is sometimes used in a broad sense that includes semi-balanced. Broadly, balanced distribution permits no void, singleton, or 7-card suit. ;Balanced hand: A hand with balanced distribution in the narrow or wide sense just above. On the first round of bidding, natural notrump bids generally denote balanced hands. ;BAM: Board-a-match, one method of scoring a duplicate bridge session or tournament. ;Bar: To prevent a player from making a bid, either by a penalty caused by an irregularity, or because partnership agreement requires a pass in a given situation. In either case, the player is said to be \\"barred.\\" ;Bar bid: A bid which by partnership agreement requires partner to pass at future turns to call in the current auction. Raises of partner's weak two opening bid are one common example. The raise might be extending the preempt, to make, or to push the opponents a level too high. If the opponents bid over a bar bid raise, the partner who made the bar bid may intend to pass, double for penalty, preempt, or raise again to push the opponents. Hence, the reason that partner is barred. The partner who made the bar bid may be ″operating.” None of the other three players can know the intent of the player who made the bar bid. Thus, the partner must pass, and the opponents must guess. ;Barometer scoring: In a duplicate event, the posting of contestants' running scores after each round. Knowledge of the current standings often adds excitement to the contest, and can affect the strategies adopted by those in a position to win the event. ;Bath coup: A holdup by declarer, to prevent an opponent from continuing a suit. In the classic position, declarer holds AJ2 and West, on declarer's left, leads K from KQ1098. By playing the 2 on West's K, South makes it impossible for West to continue spades without giving South a free finesse. ;Beer card: The 7. ;Below the line: In rubber bridge, the place on the score pad (below the main horizontal line) where trick points scored for making a contract, i.e. tricks bid for and taken exclusive of overtricks, are recorded. These are the points counted towards game. See Above the line and Bridge scoring. ;Benjaminised Acol or \\"Benji\\": A variant of Acol where 2 and 2 are strong bids of different strengths, and 2 and 2 are weak twos. Invented by Scottish international player Albert Benjamin. ;Better minor: A commonly used term for the choice of minor suit opening bid with less than four cards, typically in five card major systems. In Standard American Yellow Card, it is normal to bid the longer suit with 3 cards in one and two in the other, and 1 with 3-3. In this sense the term is a misnomer as a poor club suit (e.g. Jxx) may be opener instead of a stronger diamond suit (e.g. KQx). \\"Prepared minor\\" would be more precise terminology. See prepared bid. ;Bermuda Bowl: The trophy awarded to the winner of the World Zonal Open Team Championship, the most prestigious in bridge. More commonly the term refers to the competition itself, a biennial two-week tournament among open teams that have qualified in their geographic zones. ;Bid: # A specification of both level and denomination or strain, such as three notrump or four hearts. While any legal bid constitutes a potential contract, some bids carry special coded meanings when used by the partnership as a conventional bid and as such are not normally intended as a potential contract. # An obsolete term meaning \\"contract\\" (noun). ;Bid out of turn: A bid erroneously made when it was another player's turn to bid. Subject to penalty. ;Biddable suit: A suit that a partnership regards as long and strong enough to be bid naturally. Partnerships often employ different standards of length and strength for suits named in opening bids, in responses, in rebids and in overcalls. ;Bidding: The first stage of a deal, when players jointly determine the final contract. Having examined their own cards, they make a series of calls in rotation, which is called the auction or the bidding. ;Bidding box: A box placed on the table (one box for each player) that contains cards with calls printed on them, as well as other cards such as \\"alert\\". By selecting and displaying a card, a player can make a call without speaking. Silent bidding removes one source of unauthorized information from the game. ;Bidding space: The number of steps available in an auction, or the number of steps consumed by a bid. The sequence 1 - 1 consumes only one step, whereas 1 - 2 consumes four steps. Because alternative bids are skipped, it often happens that the more steps a bid takes up, the more specific meaning it carries. See Useful Space Principle. ;Bidding system: The complete set of agreements and understandings assigned to calls and sequences of calls used by a partnership, including a full description of the meaning of each treatment and convention. ;Biltcliffe coup: (British slang) A sarcastic term applied to a poor result as a consequence of four steps: (1) the opponents are about to play in a part score, when you bid in pass-out seat, (2) the opponents then bid game, (3) you double for penalties, and (4) they make the contract. In some circles, the coup is not recognized unless the contract makes through misdefense.Cochemé, Simon (February 2012). \\"The Coups of Bridge II\\". English Bridge, no. 239, p. 19. ;BIT: Break in tempo. See Tempo def 2. ;Blackwood convention: Popular bidding convention in contract bridge, used to determine number of partner's aces/kings to evaluate for slam bids. ;Blank # (Adjective) Unprotected by other, usually lower cards in the same suit: \\"I held the blank king of spades.\\" # (Verb) To discard in such a way as to leave a card unprotected: \\"She blanked the king of spades.\\" ;Blitz: (Slang) A win by a sufficiently wide margin in IMPs to earn the maximum possible number (or difference) of victory points. ;Blocked: (Adjective) If a suit is divided between partners in such a way that the hand with the shorter holding has only high cards, the suit cannot be run without an entry to the longer holding in another suit; it is then said to be blocked. If North holds AK and South holds QJ10, South cannot cash a third diamond trick without an entry in another suit. The diamonds are blocked until North is able to unblock by playing the ace and king. ;Board: # One particular allocation of 52 cards to the four players including the bidding, the play of the cards and the scoring based on those cards. Also called deal or hand. # A device that keeps each player's cards separate for duplicate bridge. # The dummy's hand. For example, \\"You're on the board\\" means \\"The lead is in the dummy\\". ;Board-a-match (BAM): A form of scoring for teams, analogous to matchpoint scoring for pairs. A team earns 1 point if its pairs score higher than the opposing pairs (with the same cards at the other table), 1/2 for equal scores, and 0 for lower scores. Board-a-match scoring is now less common than IMP scoring, or IMPs victory points in a Swiss teams tournament. ;Body: Intermediate cards such as the 9, 8 and 7, that contribute to a suit's trick-taking potential. ;Bonus: In bridge scoring, beyond points for bid tricks taken, which are awarded for making a contract, the additional points awarded for making a doubled contract, or for making doubled or redoubled overtricks. There are different bonus amounts at the partscore, game, small slam, and grand slam levels. The size of most bonuses depends on the vulnerability. Bonus amounts are different in rubber bridge and duplicate bridge. See Bridge scoring. ;Book # (Noun) The basic six tricks that must be taken by the declaring side. The first six \\"book\\" tricks are always assumed and are not taken into account in bidding or scoring. Thus, a contract at the 1-level commits declarer to take at least 7 (that is, 6 + 1) tricks, and provides trick points only for the trick above book. The term apparently originated from the whist practice of arranging the first six tricks into a stack called a \\"book.\\" # (Noun) The number of tricks that the defensive side must take so as to hold declarer to his contract. If the contract is 4, defenders' book is 3. # (Verb, usually passive) Slang. As declarer, to have lost the maximum number of tricks without being set. At 4, declarer is \\"booked\\" when he has lost three tricks. ;Bottom: At matchpoint scoring, a result no better than any other by a pair playing the same cards, resulting in an award of minimum matchpoints; either jointly (a shared bottom), or alone (a cold bottom, or zero). ;Boxed: (British slang) Adjective applied to a card found to be face-up during dealing, and by extension to the whole pack. Also used for a card found to be face-up in a hand extracted from a duplicate board, or for the hand itself. ;Bracket: A group of entries in a tournament that will eventually have one winner. The grouping is often done on the basis of masterpoints. ;Break # (Noun) The distribution of cards in a suit between the two opponents' (often unseen) hands: \\"I got a 4-1 spade break.\\" An even break occurs when the cards are distributed evenly or nearly so, such as 3-3 or 3-2. A bad break, connoting a distribution that is difficult to handle, suggests an unexpectedly uneven distribution, such as 5-1 or 6-0. See distribution. # (Verb) To be divided between two hands. \\"The spades broke 3-2.\\" # (Verb) To lead a particular suit for the first time during a particular deal. # (Verb) Slang. To play for and find a particular distribution, usually the most favorable. \\"I broke the spades.\\" ;Bridge maxims: A compilation of short \\"laws\\", \\"rules\\" and rules-of-thumb advice; often, not always, valid. ;The Bridge World (TBW): A monthly magazine based in New York City, The Bridge World is the oldest continuously published periodical concerning contract bridge, and the game's most prestigious technical journal. ;Broken sequence: A sequence of honor cards, one or more of which is missing, for example AQJ. ;Bullet: (Slang) An ace. ;Bump: 1. (Slang) A single raise of partner. Used as a noun or a verb. 2. In duplicate bridge, an adaptation of the Mitchell movement to accommodate a half table. The extra pair moves around the room, substituting themselves in for a particular other pair, bumping out the pair for one round.Manley et al (2011), p. 153. ;Business double: A penalty double, in contrast to various competitive and informatory doubles including takeout doubles and negative doubles. ;Bust: (Slang) A very weak hand. Sometimes paired with the name of a long suit: for example, \\"club bust\\" to denote a hand with long clubs and very little high card strength. See also Yarborough. ;Busy: # A card that is needed for some purpose is said to be busy. For example, cards that a defender is trying to preserve while declarer executes a squeeze are \\"busy\\". Contrast Idle. # A busy defense is an alternative term for an active defense. ;Butler, or Butler scoring: A method of scoring in duplicate bridge pairs events. Each pair's result on a board is compared against a \\"datum\\" score which is the arithmetic mean of all the results (usually after exclusion of one or more of the top and bottom results), and the difference converted to IMPs. Sometimes, the median is used instead of the mean. ;Bye # A round of an event during which a team or pair is not scheduled to play. # A location (\\"bye-stand\\") such as a chair or table, where boards are kept when not in use during an event. Typically used in a Mitchell movement with an even number of pairs when there is a \\"share and relay\\". C ;Caddy: An assistant to the director, or Head Director, primarily responsible for moving boards between tables and collecting score slips. ;Calcutta # Cross-IMP scoring. # A tournament in which bettors bid on participating pairs or teams. The proceeds from the auction are distributed partly as prizes to the top finishers, partly to the bettors who successfully bid on them. A pair or team can typically buy an interest in itself. ;Call: Any bid, pass, double, or redouble in the bidding stage. ;Canapé: An approach to bidding in which a player bids his shorter suit prior to his longer suit. A feature of the Blue Team Club and the Roman Club. ;Captain # In a teams competition, one person called the captain must represent a team in stipulated official settings and make stipulated official decisions for a team. A playing captain (pc) is eligible to participate as a player at the table; a non- playing captain (npc) may not play. Many team competitions including WBF world championships limit teams to six players, thus to seven members depending on the kind of captain. Other team officials such as a coach are not team members and are not covered in the rules of bridge. # The partner who makes the decision for a partnership in certain bidding situations, such as ace-asking sequences. ;Card reading: The act of determining the distribution of cards in unseen hands, and the location of high cards therein, by analyzing the bidding, play and other clues. ;Carding: The defensive signaling used by a partnership. ;Carryover, or carry-over: In a complex event, some participants begin a later stage with scores that depend on performance in an earlier stage. Simple accumulation of scores from stage to stage is full carryover but the term is commonly used only when carryover is less than full. :Some team events have a later knockout stage with carryover equal to some fraction of any margin of victory from an early-stage match between the same teams. :Many tournaments for teams, pairs, or individuals have stages that progressively reduce the field, such as by cutting the bottom half at the end of each day. Sometimes the qualifiers continue with a fraction of their qualifying margins as carryover, which effectively gives weight less than one to points scored in the earlier, larger, lower-quality field. Sometimes there is no carryover; comfortable and borderline qualification are equivalent in the next stage. ;Cash: To take a trick with a card that is currently the highest in the suit, thought likely to succeed, or to take all available winners in a suit. ;Cavendish variation: A version of Chicago, with dealer's side not vulnerable on the second and third hands, as in the standard version. ;CBF: Canadian Bridge Federation. ;Change of suit: A bid in a new suit, as 1 in the sequence 1 - 1; 1. ;Checkback Stayman: A common conventional agreement following a 1NT rebid, searching for an unbid major suit or a preference to responder's major. ;Chicago: A variant of rubber bridge in which a rubber consists of four deals with vulnerability predetermined for each deal. ;Chicane: A hand without any trumps. ;CHO: (Slang) Centre-hand opponent, a derogatory or facetious term for one's partner, or partners generally. Compare LHO and RHO, left- and right- hand opponents. ;Chuck: (Slang) An error in bidding or play, which was or might have been costly. Also used as a verb. ;Chunky: A suit with enough honor strength to play well unaided by partner's cards (but not solid) is chunky. Normally said of four-card suits. AQJ10 is a chunky suit; AQ96 is not chunky. ;Claim: A statement by declarer about how the remaining unplayed tricks will be won or lost. Normally the claiming player exposes his hand and describes the sequence of play for the remaining tricks (but such plays as finesses, unless already proven, are disallowed). A claim is best made only when the play of the rest of the hand is obvious. Claims are often inadvisable: apart from the possibility of a mistaken analysis, it can take longer to explain the line of play than to play it. See also Concession. ;Clear a suit: Knock out an opponent's high-card control of a suit, or unblock one's own high cards. ;Closed hand: Declarer's hand (as distinct from the dummy, which is faced or open). ;Closed room: In a team match, a room where two of the pairs compete, and in which spectators are not allowed. ;Coffeehousing: Making improper remarks to mislead the opponents, or asking improper questions designed to suggest a defensive play. ;Cold: A contract that a player cannot fail to make, even against the best defense, is cold. ;Colors first: A bidding approach where players indicate suits (denominations) before showing high card strength. For example, natural suit overcalls and natural one-level suit opening bids are usually \\"colors first.\\" Natural notrump opening bids and natural notrump overcalls usually show strength rather than suits. A Michaels cue bid is usually \\"colors first,\\" but a takeout double is usually more \\"values first.\\" ;Combination # Suit combination. # A combination finesse is one of several tactics in play of the cards that includes multiple finesses in one suit or combines another technique with a finesse. ;Combination play: A line of play that offers more than one chance to take additional tricks: for example, playing to drop an honor in a longer suit and then finessing for an honor in a shorter suit. ;Come-on: A defensive signal that encourages partner to continue a suit, usually by means of the rank of the card used to follow suit. ;Comic notrump: A notrump overcall that shows a weak hand with a long suit, to which the overcaller can escape if doubled. Also known as Gardener 1NT. ;Communication: # The placement of the lead in one or the other of the two partnership hands, so as to make a subsequent lead from the more advantageous hand, specifically the ability to place the lead in such hand. # The means of conveying a message to partner via the bidding and by the card played to a trick. The only legal means of communication is through the calls and plays themselves, rather than through mannerisms such as tone of voice and hesitations. Often generalized as communications in both senses. ;Comparative scoring: The method of scoring used in matchpoint or Board-a-Match events. The metric used is not the number of points earned on a particular deal, as it is when using quantitative scoring, but the number of pairs that have been out- scored. ;Competitive auction: A bidding sequence which involves both partnerships. Also, competitive bidding. ;Concession: A statement by a player as to the number of remaining tricks that he must lose. See also Claim. ;Condone: To act after an opponent's irregularity without arranging for the penalty specified in the Laws to be applied. ;Congratulatory jack: The unnecessary play (by follow-suit or by discard) of a jack following partner's exceptionally successful action. More often used by the defense, but possible as a play from dummy. ;Congress: (Mainly British) A nationally or locally organised duplicate bridge competition held at a single location and usually involving both pairs and teams events, typically lasting one or two days but sometimes as many as ten. The more usual North American term is tournament. ;Constructive # Bidding that is aimed at reaching a side's optimum contract, as distinct from calls intended to interfere with the opponents' bidding. # Constructive raise: by partnership agreement, a single raise of a major suit opening that shows more strength than usual. ;Contract # The statement of the pair who has won the bidding, that they will take at least the stated number of tricks. The contract consists of two components: the level, stating the number of tricks to be taken (in addition to the book tricks), and the denomination, denoting the trump suit (or its absence in a notrump bid). The last bid in the bidding phase denotes the final contract. # Short for contract bridge in contrast to auction bridge (auction) and other card games in the family. ;Control # A feature of a hand which prevents the defenders from taking sufficient immediate tricks in a specific suit so as to set the contract or make the setting of the contract unavoidable. Aces are termed \\"first-round\\" controls and kings are termed \\"second-round\\" controls. In trump contracts, voids are also considered first-round controls and singletons second-round controls. See also Stopper. # (Said of trump contracts) Declarer's ability to manage the trump suit successfully. To lose control usually means being forced to shorten one's trumps so much that the opponents can subsequently control the play of the hand. See Forcing defense. ;Control- bid: A bid that shows control of a particular suit. Often a cue bid, but not all cue bids are control-bids. ;Convenient club: See Short club. ;Convention # An agreement between partners on an artificial meaning of a call or sequence of calls, which is not necessarily related to the length and strength of bid suits or of willingness to play in notrump. Many bidding conventions are artificial; see, for example, Slam-seeking conventions. # An agreement that a particular defensive play has a special meaning. Compare with Treatment. ;Convention card: A form filled out by a partnership and available to their opponents, that shows the bidding and play conventions they are using. Normally used during tournaments, their format may be prescribed by the governing bridge organization. ;Convert: # To change the effect of a call. For example, passing partner's overcall of 2 when playing Michaels cue bids converts the overcall from a request to bid a major suit to a contract of 2. There are many other applications: for example, to pass partner's takeout double is to convert it to a penalty double. # In rubber bridge and Chicago, a part score is converted into game when a further score brings the total below the line to 100 or more points. ;Correct: In the bidding, to choose (usually) partner's first bid suit; in that case, a correction is equivalent to a preference. ;COS: Acronym or initialism for Choice of Slams. An artificial or natural bid made to ask partner to select a strain from several choices where the slam might be played. ;Count # (Noun) The number of cards held in a suit or suits, usually said of an opponent's hand. # (Verb) To determine, by inference or by follow-suit, the number of cards held in a suit by an opponent. # (Noun) In squeeze play, the number of tricks that declarer must lose before the squeeze can function. See rectify the count. ;Count signal: A defensive card play that shows whether the player has an even or odd number of cards in a suit. ;Coup # Any extremely skillful play. # Any of several specific play techniques, such as the Scissors coup, Trump coup, Devil's coup or Vienna coup. ;Coup en passant: The lead of a side suit in which both second and third hands are void, second hand holding a high trump, in such a way that third hand cannot be prevented from taking a trick with a low trump. It is a form of elopement. ;Coup without a name: See Scissors coup. \\"Coup without a name\\" is an earlier term for the coup, conferred by Ely Culbertson. ;Cover card: A card (honor or extra trump) which is known to compensate one of partner's losers; for example, a king in trumps covers partner's trump loser. ;Crack: (Slang, verb). To make a penalty double. Also, \\"cracked\\", a doubled contract, regardless of the result; as in e.g. \\"The contract was 2 cracked\\". ;Crash # (Usually written CRASH or CRaSh) Acronym for Color, RAnk and SHape; a convention showing a 2-suited hand, as an overcall at first opportunity after an opponent's strong artificial 1, 1, 2 or 2 opening. The two suits share the same color (red or black), rank (majors, or minors) or shape (rounded or pointed). The type of pairing is shown by the number of steps above RHO's bid which are taken up by the over call. # (Uncapitalised) The play of two winners by a pair on a single trick: for example, the ace and king of trumps. This usually involves a declarer's use of a deceptive play to cause a defender to follow suit with one high card (for example, the king from Kx when the other defender holds the singleton ace). ;Crocodile coup: On defense, second hand's play of a higher card than apparently necessary, so as to obtain the lead. The play is intended to prevent fourth hand from being forced into the lead to make a return favorable to declarer. The name suggests a crocodile opening its maw to swallow up partner's winning card. ;Cross: To enter the opposite hand. Normally used of dummy or declarer's hand: \\"He crossed to dummy in diamonds.\\" ;Crossruff: A playing technique in trump contracts, where extra tricks are gained by ruffing in both hands alternately. ;Cross-IMP scoring: A form of IMP scoring in pairs tournaments, where each pair's score is determined as an (averaged) sum of differences to all other scores (rather than to a single datum score). Also known as X-Imps or Calcutta. ;Cuebid, cue bid, or cue-bid # A bid of the opponents' suit in a competitive auction. Usually a conventional, forcing bid that shows strength or an unusual hand, or a particular distribution. # A bid that shows a control in a suit (usually with an ace or king, sometimes with a void), but does not indicate length or strength in the suit otherwise. See control bid. Partnership agreements indicate when in an uncontested auction a bid is considered a cuebid. Usually used in exploring for a slam contract (see Bridge conventions (slam seeking)), or for showing stoppers needed for a notrump game. ; Culbertson four-five notrump : A slam- seeking convention devised by Ely Culbertson, in which a player bids 4NT or 5NT to show possession of defined numbers of keycards (aces, and kings in bid suits), and to which that player's partner responds in generally natural fashion. Since the 1950s, it has been almost entirely superseded by variants of the Blackwood convention. ;Culbertson system: The earliest dominant bidding system, developed by Ely and Josephine Culbertson. Its principal features were an approach–forcing bidding style, four-card majors, strong two-bids and the use of an honor trick table to evaluate hand strength. ;The curse of Scotland: The 9. The origin of the term is uncertain. ; Cut in and cut out: In rubber bridge, it is customary on completion of a rubber to invite other players in the cardroom to play in the next one, often by a cry of \\"Table up\\". The players in the completed rubber draw cards to determine who will withdraw; the one or more who draw the lowest card or cards are said to cut out, and their replacements to cut in. ;Cutthroat bridge: A form of three-handed bridge. D ;DAB: An abbreviation of directional asking bid. ;Danger hand #An opponent who, if he obtains the lead, can damage declarer's prospects. #When defending, either declarer's or dummy's hand which, if it gains the lead, can damage the defenders' prospects. ;Datum: The mean or median of raw scores on a deal. The datum is used as a basis for calculating IMPs for the participating teams or pairs. The datum may be trimmed by removing extreme scores at either end of the distribution, a procedure whose effect on a mean or on a median depends on the degree of skewness in the raw scores. ;Dead #A hand that has no card of entry, usually in reference to the dummy. #A hand that has a suit consisting only of low cards of no significance. For example, two dead spades. ;Deal #One particular allocation of 52 cards to the four players including the bidding, the play of the cards and the scoring based on those cards. Also called board or hand. #(Verb) To allocate the 52 cards to the four players or hands, 13 each. ;Dealer: The player who makes the first call in the auction. In some versions of the game, this player also deals the cards. In rubber bridge, the first dealer is usually decided by a cut for the highest card. In duplicate bridge, cards are dealt only at the start of the session and the deal is preserved during the session by the use of boards. The \\"dealer\\" who will make the first call is identified by a mark on the physical board, commonly the word \\"dealer\\". ;Deck: The 52 cards used in bridge. ;Declaration: The contract in which a hand is played. ;Declarative–Interrogative: D–I. ;Declarer: Of the partnership that makes the final bid in the auction, declarer is the partner who first names the denomination or strain of the final bid, thus the strain of the contract. During the play, declarer sits across from the dummy and calls for cards from the dummy's hand, or \\"plays the dummy.\\" ;Declaring side: The side that wins the auction. ;Deep finesse: # A finesse against two or more cards. # The trade name of a commercially available computer program which performs double dummy hand analysis. ;Defeat: (Said of the contract). To prevent declarer from taking the number of tricks called for by his contract. Also, set. ;Defence: Declarer's opponents or their line of play. ;Defenders: The pair that tries to defeat the contract. ;Defensive bidding #A bid or sequence of bids designed to hinder the opponents' bidding, including sacrifices. #All bidding by the partnership which does not open, which necessarily begins with a double or overcall (intervention). ;Delayed: Postponed, as the jump preference in the auction 1 - 1; 2 - 3. Many bids have a different meaning depending on whether or not they are made at the first opportunity. ;Denomination (or strain): Component of a bid that denotes the proposed trump suit or notrump. Thus, there are five denominations – notrump, spades, hearts, diamonds and clubs. The Laws of Contract Bridge (American edition)ACBL Laws of Contract Bridge, 2003. and Laws of Duplicate Bridge use the term denomination exclusively but \\"the modern term is strain\\" according to the sixth edition of The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge.Francis et al, 2001, p. 114. This observation in the entry \\"Denomination\\" does not appear in the subsequent seventh Official Encyclopedia (Manley et al, 2011). ;DEPO: Acronym for Double Even, Pass Odd. Conventional method for bidding over interference with Blackwood. ;Deschapelles coup: On defense, the lead of an unsupported honor in order to create an entry to partner's hand. ;Deuce: The lowest spot card, the 2. In signaling, it is the only unambiguous card. ;Develop: To establish tricks in a suit, usually by forcing out the opponents' stoppers. ;Devil's coup: In the endgame, the play of a side suit through a defender to create an over ruff and a subsequent trump finesse. ;D–I: (Abbreviation of Declarative-Interrogative.) 4NT as a general slam try that asks partner to show features. D–I is incorporated in several bidding systems, including Neapolitan, Blue Team Club and Kaplan–Sheinwold. Players distinguish the D–I and Blackwood uses of 4NT by context. ;Direction: A player's position at the bridge table (North, East, South or West). ;Direct position: Usually said of a bid that is made immediately following RHO's bid. Contrast Balance (verb), on balancing action in balancing position. ;Directional asking bid: Often abbreviated as DAB. A cuebid of opponent's suit below 3NT, showing a partial stop in that suit and requesting partner to bid notrump with a holding such as Qx or Jxx. Common in the UK, less so elsewhere. ;Director: Also tournament director (TD). The referee (in duplicate bridge). The director enforces the rules, assigns penalties for violations, and oversees the progress of the game. The director may also be responsible for the final scoring. In a large tournament there may be several directors reporting to a Head Director. In ACBL-sponsored events, a director's ruling as to bridge fact may be appealed; a ruling as to discipline, so as to maintain an orderly event, may not. ;Discard #(Verb) To play a card that is neither of the suit led, nor trump, and that therefore cannot win the trick. #(Noun) The card so played. ;Discouraging card: A carding signal that discourages partner from leading a particular suit. Contrast Come-on. ;Discovery play: A play, either by declarer or by the defense, intended to obtain information about the location of other cards. ;Distribution :#(Suit distribution) Of one suit on a deal, the numbers of cards or lengths in the four hands. Sometimes the length of a suit in one or two hands is known or presumed and its \\"distribution\\" covers only three or two hands, as \\"opposing distribution\\" said of the other pair from the perspective of one pair or player. :#(Hand distribution, also shape or pattern) Of one 13-card hand on a deal, the numbers of cards or lengths in the four suits. Sometimes the length of one or two suits is known or presumed and \\"distribution\\" covers only three or two suits, as \\"distribution in the minors\\" said of one hand whose major-suit distribution is known. :: General. The degree to which four suits in one hand, one suit in four hands, or all of the hands and suits are dealt in long and short holdings. Long and short holdings constitute \\"lots of distribution\\" and three-card holdings in particular constitute \\"no distribution\\". :: Specific. Either way, four whole numbers that sum to 13 are commonly used to denote a distribution briefly, such as 4333 or 4-3-3-3 for a hand comprising one four-card suit and three three-card suits; or for a suit with one four-card holding and three three-card holdings in the four hands. Also 22 or 2-2 for the opposing distribution of spades when one pair holds nine of them; or for one hand's distribution in the minors when it holds nine in the Majors. :: Fully specified. Conventionally neither 4333 nor 4-3-3-3 indicates which is the four-card suit in a hand while 4=3=3=3 means four spades, represented first, and three each in hearts, diamonds, and clubs. Thus 4=6=2=1 means 4 spades, 6 hearts, 2 diamonds, and 1 club. ;Distribution points: A measure of one hand's strength due to the length or shortness of suits. See Hand evaluation. ;DONT: Acronym for Disturb Opponents Notrump. A conventional defense to notrump opening bids. ;DOPE: Acronym for Double Odd, Pass Even. A conventional method for bidding over interference with Blackwood. ;DOPI: A proxi-acronym for Double, O (the letter O standing for zero or none), Pass and I (the capital i standing for the numeral 1 or one). A conventional method for bidding over interference with Blackwood. Pronounced \\"dopey.\\" ;Double: #A call that increases penalties if the opponents fail to make their contract, but consequently also increases the bonuses if they make it. A player can double only a contract bid by the opposition. Referred to as penalty double. #A call having various alternative conventional meanings depending upon the bidding context. See Informatory double, Takeout double, Negative double, Lead-directing double, Responsive double and Support double. ;Double dummy: (Adjective or adverb.) Said of a play or line of play that seems to be made with knowledge of all four hands, as if there were at least two dummies visible. Contrast Single dummy. : When said of the defenders jointly, \\"double dummy defense\\" suggests that that pair knows all four hands and agrees on both goals and tactics such as falsecards, as if the cards were visible and they discussed those points. ;Double dummy problem: A bridge problem presented for entertainment or teaching, in which the solver is presented with all four hands and is asked to determine the course of play that will achieve or defeat a particular contract. ;Double-elimination tournament, or double elimination: Double knockout. ;Double finesse: A finesse for two missing cards. ;Double into game: To double a part score such that, if the contract is fulfilled, the total of the doubled trick scores will exceed 100 points. ;Double knockout: A form of knockout competition in which teams are eliminated after losing two matches rather than after losing one. Commonly, teams with no losses face each other (undefeated teams) and teams with one loss face each other (one-loser teams), insofar as possible. ;Double negative: An agreement regarding a second negative bid by a player who has already made one. Normally used regarding sequences that follow strong, forcing opening bids. ;Double raise: A raise of two levels, such as 1 - 3. ;Double squeeze: A squeeze in which each opponent must guard a different suit, and both opponents must guard a third suit. ;Doubleton: A holding of exactly two cards in a suit. ;Down #A contract that is defeated is said to be down. #(Followed by a number) The number of tricks by which a contract fails: for example, \\"Down two.\\" ;Down the line: To bid the higher of two adjacent suits before the lower. For example, of two five-card majors, the spade suit is normally bid before the heart suit. Contrast Up the line. ;Draw: To extract, usually trumps. To remove the opponents' trump cards is to \\"draw trumps.\\" ;Drive out: To force a stopper from an opponent's hand, usually by repeatedly leading the suit. ;Drop #(Verb) To fall under a higher card: \\"The Q dropped under the K.\\" #(Noun) That occurrence itself: \\"He played for the drop instead of finessing.\\" ;Duck: A play technique in which a player does not immediately play a card that might take a trick, but plays a small card instead. ;Dummy] #The partner of the declarer. Dummy's cards are placed face up on the table and played by the declarer. Dummy has few rights and may not participate in choices concerning the play of the hand. #The dummy's hand as exposed on the table. ;Dummy play: The play of the hand by declarer. The apparent contradiction is due to the fact that declarer plays both declarer's cards and the dummy's. ;Dummy reversal: A playing technique in trump contracts that gains extra tricks by ruffing in the hand that began with the longer trumps so that that hand ends up with shorter trumps. ;Dump: To lose a match deliberately, usually so as to assist another team or pair in the event. A subject of considerable controversy in the 1990s and beyond. ;Duplicate bridge: A form of bridge where every deal is played at several tables, by several pairs, and their scores on each deal are subsequently compared. A minimum of two tables (four pairs) are required for a duplicate bridge event. Each entry might be a pair, or a team consisting of two or more pairs; the type of scoring varies accordingly. The hands of each deal are kept in metal or plastic containers called boards that are passed between tables. ;Duplication of values: Possession of values in the same suit in both partners' hands so arranged that they do not pull their full weight. (1) High card values in one hand and a singleton or void in the other; e.g. KJ9 facing a void is much less useful than KJ9 facing Q4. (2) High cards in short suits in both hands, e.g. AJ facing KQ. ;Dustbin Notrump: A bidding response of 1NT to an opening bid that doesn't show a balanced hand but a weak hand (6-9 HCP), no support for partner and no higher ranking 4+ card suit to bid. So the hand could be unbalanced. E ;Eastern Scientific: A bidding style that developed in the Eastern United States, particularly the New York region. It is characterized by five-card majors with a forcing one \\"notrump\\" response and limit raises, strong notrump with Jacoby transfers, and strong (but not game forcing) two-over-one responses. ;Eau de cologne: (Slang, chiefly British) A hand with 7-4-1-1 distribution, from the cologne brand 4711. ;EBL: European Bridge League, the sport governing body for contract bridge in Europe, and the sponsoring organisation for many bridge competitions there. ;EBU: English Bridge Union, the official organising body of bridge in England. ;Echo: The play of first the higher, then the lower of two cards of the same suit on separate tricks to encourage or, by prior agreement, to discourage (see upside-down signals) partner's continuation of a suit; or to signal possession of (normally) an even number of cards in the suit at the time the higher card is played. ;EHAA: Every Hand An Adventure, a bidding style that emphasizes very weak notrump opening bids (often 10-12 HCP), four-card majors, and undisciplined weak-two bids. ;Eight ever, nine never: A bridge maxim that advises players when to finesse for a missing queen. With eight cards in the suit, always (\\"ever\\") finesse; but with nine cards, never finesse, rather play for the queen to drop under the play of the ace and king. Experienced players often ignore this advice in favor of considerations such as the danger hand, combination play, and the known or inferred distribution of other suits. ;EKB: Exclusion Keycard Blackwood, a variant of Roman Keycard Blackwood. EKB uses a suit bid rather than a notrump bid to show a void in that suit and to exclude the named suit ace from the count of keycards. ;Elimination: The removal, by playing a suit or suits, of safe exit cards from defenders' hands, normally in preparation for an endplay. The classic (but not the only) example is to leave an endplayed defender with the choice of conceding a ruff and discard or giving declarer a free finesse. ;Elope, elopement: To win a trick by ruffing with a trump lower in rank than an opponent's trump. The coup en passant is an example of an elopement. ;Encrypted: An agreement that the meaning of bids or card signals may change as more information about a deal becomes available. For example, when declarer shows out of a suit, the defenders can tell whether the rank of West's lowest remaining card in the suit is even or odd (and declarer probably does not have that information). The defenders might have agreed that if West's lowest remaining card is even, normal attitude signals will be in effect, but if it is odd, upside-down signals will be used. In such a case, the defenders' agreement is encrypted. ;Ending: The layout of the cards when just a few tricks remain to be played. In a \\"four-card ending\\", each player has four cards left. Such positions can be of special interest because squeezes and other endplays tend to occur near the end of the play. ;Endplay: A play which forces a particular opponent to win a trick, so that that opponent must then make a favorable lead. That player is said to be \\"endplayed\\". Normally, the player who is endplayed is a defender. Although the word implies that the play occurs toward the end of a hand, it often occurs earlier, and in exceptional cases the opening leader can be said to be \\"endplayed at trick one.\\" ;Enter # To win a trick in the opposite hand, thereby giving it the right to lead to the next trick. # To make the first call for a partnership after the opponents have bid. # To join a bridge competition. ;Entry # A card that allows a particular hand to win a trick that partner or an opponent has led to. Entries are vital to communication. # A seating assignment in a bridge competition. Entries designate the participants' initial table number, direction at that table, and (if applicable) section. ;Entry-shifting squeeze: A squeeze in which the declarer decides whether to overtake the squeeze card or to let it hold the trick, depending on the play of the intervening opponent. ;Entry squeeze: A squeeze that puts pressure on a holding that interferes with declarer's entries. ;Equal level conversion (ELC): An agreement concerning rebids after take-out doubles. Traditionally, the bid of a new suit by the player who has made a take-out double is considered forcing. Under the equal level conversion agreement, the bid of a new suit by the doubler is not forcing if it is at the same level as advancer's bid. So, equal level conversion means that in the sequence 1 - (Dbl) - P - (2); P - (2), 2 is considered non-forcing. ;Equals: Cards in one hand that are adjacent in rank and thus have equal trick-taking power. ;Escape suit: A long suit to which a bidder can escape if necessary or desirable. The bidder of a comic notrump might run to his long suit if doubled. ;Establish: To make winners of the remaining cards in a suit by playing or forcing out higher cards. ;Even # A split with the same number of cards in each hand. A 2-2 split is an even split. # Of the number of cards in a suit found in a hand: two cards, four cards, and so on. ;Event: A duplicate bridge contest. ;Exclusion bid: A bid, such as 2 in the Roman Club system, that shows length in all suits except the one named. ;Exclusion Blackwood: An agreement that responder to a Blackwood bid will show the number of aces held outside a particular suit. ;Exit card: A card that is used to put a different hand on lead, normally to avoid making a self-destructive lead in another suit. ;Expert: Someone who plays bridge better than others in their usual level of play. ;Exposed card: A card whose suit and rank become known through an irregularity. An exposed card may be subject to penalty. ;Extra values: Values (in the form of High card points, shortage or cover cards), which are in addition to the values that a player has promised so far in the bidding. F ;F1: Forcing one round. See One round force. ;Face # (Noun) The front of a card; the side that displays its suit and rank. # (Verb) To turn a card so that its face is visible to other players. ;Face card: A king, queen, or jack. Contrast Honor. ;Factoring: The adjustment of matchpoint scores to correct for dissimilar conditions. For example, a game played with a Mitchell movement might have an extra N–S pair, causing a bye round for N–S. The top is therefore lower for N–S pairs than for E–W pairs, and the N-S scores are multiplied by a fraction (or \\"factor\\") to make them commensurate with the E–W scores. ;Fall: To be captured by a higher card. See drop. ;False preference: A return to partner's first-bid suit despite a longer holding in the second suit. Usually intended to give partner an opportunity for another bid. ;False sacrifice: Phantom sacrifice. ;Falsecard: A card played with the intention of deceiving an opponent as to one's true holding. Also, the act of making such a play. ;Fast arrival: A style of bidding under which the fewer bids used to reach a contract (usually said of game contracts), the weaker the bidder's hand. Fast arrival holds that 1 - 2; 2 - 4 is weaker than 1 - 2; 2 - 3; 3NT - 4. Contrast Slow arrival. ;Fast rubber: A rubber completed in two games. See slow rubber. ;Feature: An honor or shortness in a suit. Conventional bids such as splinter bids or D-I are intended to show or elicit features. ;Fert: (Slang) Short for \\"fertilizer\\", a very weak opening bid. A systemic treatment in strong pass systems. ;FG: an abbreviation for forcing to game; see Game force ;Field: All the players in a bridge event, as in \\"with the field\\" to refer to an action that most players will take, and \\"against the field\\" for an unusual action. ;Field a psych: Deciding correctly that partner has psyched in the absence of a call that reveals the psych. Sometimes used when that decision is made on the basis of unauthorized information or an undisclosed partnership understanding. ;Fillers: Mid-rank cards that strengthen a suit. See body. ;Final contract: The last bid made on a hand. ;Finesse: An attempt to gain power for lower-ranking cards by taking advantage of the favorable position of higher-ranking cards held by the opposition. ;Fit # A partnership's combined holding of many cards in a suit (usually 8 cards or more in the two combined hands) that might be used as trumps. # Two hands that are productive together (i.e., that have at least one fitting suit and few wasted values). Compare with Misfit. :See also Moysian fit and Golden fit. ;Fit bid: A bid in a suit that shows length and strength in the bid suit plus a fit for partner's suit. Jump shifts in competition are often defined as fit- bids. See also Fragment bid and Mixed (definition 2). ;Five-card majors: An agreement that an opening bid in spades or hearts promises at least five cards in the suit. The alternative agreement is four-card majors. ;Fix # (Noun) An undeservedly poor result, usually caused by an opponent's error or eccentric play that happens to turn out well. # (Verb) To be the victim of a fix: \\"We were fixed on Board 8.\\" ;Flag-flying: An obsolete term for making a preemptive bid. ;Flannery: A conventional opening bid of two diamonds (some prefer two hearts instead) to show 11-15 HCP with 5 hearts and 4 spades. ;Flat # Flat hand: A hand that lacks distributional features such as a singleton, a void, or a very long suit. Often, 4-3-3-3 distribution. # Flat board: A deal in duplicate bridge that results in scores across the field that are identical, or nearly so. ;Float # To be followed by two or three passes. For example, West's spade bid \\"floated around\\" to South in 1 - (P) - P. # To fail to cover the card led, usually by two consecutive hands. \\"South floated the Q to East.\\" ;Flower movement: An adaptation of the Howell movement in which the players, rather than the boards, progress regularly from table to table. Also known as \\"Endless Howell\\". ;Follow suit, sometimes simply \\"follow\\": To play a card of the same suit as the one that was first led to the trick. Failure to follow suit when one can do so constitutes a revoke. ;Force to: To bid with the intention of causing the bidding to proceed to a particular level. For example: \\"In this auction, 2 forced to game\\", or \\"My reverse forced to the three-level.\\" ;Forcing bid: A bid that, by partnership understanding, requires the bidder's partner to make another bid. A forcing bid is not necessarily a strong bid. It is legal to pass partner's forcing bid, and players occasionally do so if they believe it advantageous on a given hand, but it is damaging to partnership confidence. :See also Game force, Grand slam force and One round force. ;Forcing defense: The lead and subsequent continuation of a suit that the defenders believe declarer will have to ruff in the long trump hand. The strategy is to shorten declarer's trump holding so as to leave the defenders in control of the hand. See Tap. ;Forcing notrump: An agreement that a 1NT response to a 1 or 1 opening is a forcing bid. ;Forcing pass # A pass in a competitive auction that requires partner either to make another bid or to double or redouble the opponents' current call. Experienced partnerships often have agreements about the meaning of bidding immediately in contrast to making a forcing pass and then bidding over partner's double (pass and pull). # An initial pass when playing a strong pass system. ; Forcing take-out : Obsolete name for a strong jump shift by responder. ;Fork: A tenace. ;Fouled board: A board whose cards are not distributed as they were when first played, due to returning the cards to their slots erroneously. ;Four-card majors: An agreement that an opening bid of 1 or 1 promises at least four cards in the suit bid. The usual alternative is five-card majors. The four-card major agreement was standard during the first four decades of contract bridge, but has since given way to five-card majors in most \\"standard\\" systems such as 2/1 game forcing and Standard American. It is used in Acol, the Blue Team Club and EHAA. ;Four-deal bridge: See Chicago. ;Fourth # A player needed to complete a table, usually said of rubber bridge. # Of four-card suit length: for example, Q987 is referred to as \\"queen fourth\\" or \\"queen-fourth\\". ;Fourth hand: The fourth player with an opportunity to bid, or to play to a trick. ;Fourth suit forcing (FSF, or 4SF) # The initial use of a bid of the fourth suit as forcing to some level. # An agreement that the partnership's bid of the fourth suit, in addition to its forcing nature, is possibly artificial. ;Fragment: A holding of three or even two cards in a suit, thus not long enough to suggest as a trump suit. A partnership may treat the bid of a fragment as a means of implying shortness in another suit (see fragment bid). A fragment may also be bid after the single raise of a major as a help suit game try. ;Fragment bid: A second-round jump bid (usually a double jump) that by agreement shows a fit with partner's last-bid suit and shortness in another suit. Under this agreement, in 1 - 1; 3 the bid of 3 is a fragment bid, showing a fit for hearts and a singleton or void in diamonds. The suit of the fragment bid is often three cards long. Compare with Splinter bid. ;Freak, or freak hand: A hand with a very long suit or suits. Most would regard a hand with two six card suits as a freak. ;Free bid: A bid that is made when a pass would still allow partner to make a bid. Normally used of a bid that is made after partner has opened the bidding and RHO has overcalled. Compare with Negative free bid. ;Free finesse: A position in which a player leads up to an opponent's tenace, solving that opponent's possible guess. The term is normally used when the player is forced to make that lead. ;Frozen: A frozen suit is one that neither side can play without damage to its own holding in the suit. Declarer can sometimes duck the defense's lead to freeze the suit. See example at right. G ;Gambling 3NT: An opening bid of 3NT. The bidder hopes to make the contract by means of a long minor suit rather than by a preponderance of high cards. ;Game: # A contract, bid and made, worth 100 points or more. The undoubled game contracts are 3NT (40 for the first trick + 30 each for the second and third); 4 and 4 in the majors (4 tricks × 30 points per trick); 5 and 5 in the minors (5 tricks × 20 points per trick). Game can also be made via a doubled or redoubled contract: e.g., 2 doubled is worth 2 × (2 tricks × 30 points per trick) = 120 points. The pair bidding and making the game is awarded a bonus. See bridge scoring. # In rubber bridge and Chicago, a score of 100 or more points below the line, achieved either by making a game contract or by converting a part score. ;Game force (GF or FG): A bid that asks partner not to pass before the partnership's bidding has reached game (or the opponents have been doubled at a level high enough to compensate). Some treatments relax the requirement: for example, the agreement that in the sequence 1M - 2m, the 2m response is a game force unless the suit is rebid. So, in 1 - 2; 2 - 3, 3 would cancel the game-forcing message of the 2 bid. :See also Forcing bid, Grand slam force and One round force. ;Game try: A bid that invites partner to bid game in a particular suit, made when a fit in that suit is known more than one level below game. Routinely the occasion a single raise from one to two of a major, as both 1S - 2S and 1C - 1S - 2S (opponents silent). In those two auctions all five bids from 2N to 3S are potentially game tries. What does it mean to bid one side suit rather than another? A short suit game try shows singleton or void in the suit bid, which implies significant duplication of values if partner holds the K or Q (the A or J, less so, and three small shows there is no duplication). A help suit game try shows at least three cards, generally with at least two losers. In 1984, the Encyclopedia referred to the entry \\"weak suit game try\\" and gave three small cards for example. It also referred \\"game try\\" to the entry \\"trial bid\\" with example holdings xxx, Axx, KTxx, and Jxxx in the side suit; shortness is a good holding and so is a good suit. Such a suit is likely to be a good one for the defenders to attack. A long suit game try shows a suit of at least four cards, so that a double fit is not unlikely; if a major suit, that is a potential alternative trump suit. Anyway, it shows that a cover card is useful regardless of length, and other cards are likely to help. ;Golden fit: A combined partnership holding of at least eight cards in a suit. In the UK, simply known as a fit. :See also Moysian fit ;Good: Said of a card or cards that have been established. ;Goren system, or Goren: A bidding system dominant in the United States from the 1940s through the 1960s, based on the Culbertson system. The principal difference between the two systems was in hand evaluation: Culbertson used honor tricks to assess a hand's strength whereas Goren used high card points and distribution points. ;Goulash: A style of dealing, usually in rubber and Chicago games, where the cards are not thoroughly shuffled between deals and are dealt in groups. It results in \\"wild\\" card distributions. ;Grand coup: A trump coup in which the cards ruffed in the long trump hand are already winners. ;Grand slam: See slam. ;Green: (Slang, mainly British) Non-vulnerable. From the colour of the paint on a duplicate board. Also: \\"green all\\" and \\"both green\\", neither side vulnerable; and \\"at green\\" or \\"green against red\\", non-vulnerable against vulnerable. ;Grand slam force (GSF): A method of determining whether the partnership holds the top trump honors when the bid of a grand slam is a possibility. In its original form, the GSF was initiated with a bid of 5NT, asking partner to bid a grand slam with two of the top three honors in the trump suit. Depending on the prior bidding, other bids are often used in place of 5NT, and there is a variety of schemes for responding to the GSF. See Josephine. :See also Forcing bid, Game force and One round force. ;Grosvenor gambit: A play that creates no direct advantage and might lose. Its principal features are that an opponent will not suspect that such an inept play has been made, and that once the opponent realizes what has occurred, he will be frustrated and angry (and therefore less effective) during subsequent hands. The ploy was first described in a satiric story by Frederick B. Turner in the June 1973 issue of The Bridge World. ;Guard: A holding that prevents an opponent from taking a trick or tricks. See stopper, guard squeeze. H ;Hand # The 13 cards held by one player on a deal. # A deal or board. # Ordinally, a player counting in rotation from dealer or first hand. For example, \\"Third hand bid 1.\\" ;Hand pattern: See distribution. ;Hand record: A document that lists the cards in each hand of every board played in a duplicate bridge session. Often, hand records also list contracts each partnership can make with double dummy declarer play and double dummy defense. ;Help suit game try: The bid of a side suit after a single raise, used to help partner evaluate game prospects when opener's hand is roughly a trick stronger than a minimum opening. For example, after 1 - 2, opener might rebid 3 with a side club suit or a strong club fragment. The bid tells partner where high cards will be most helpful, and requests partner to take positive action, such a direct jump to game, with strength in that suit. Otherwise, the bid requests partner to sign off (in this example, by bidding 3). See short-suit game try and game try. ;Herbert negative: Use of the cheapest bid (sometimes only the cheapest suit bid) as an artificial negative response to (for example) forcing 2-bids, strong artificial 2, or takeout doubles. It was advocated by Walter Herbert. ;Hesitation: A brief pause before a bid or play, considered somewhat shorter than a Huddle. ;High–low signal: See Echo. ;High card # An honor card. # The highest-ranking card in a suit at any point during the play. ;High card points (HCP): A measure or estimate of the strength of cards in the play of a deal. Routinely the high card points of all 13 cards in one player's hand are counted in sum, as a measure of playing strength of the entire hand, or one component of such a measure. Every honor card is assigned a numeric value. See Hand evaluation. ;Hold # To keep declarer to a particular number of tricks, usually the number required to make the contract. # To have in one's hand a particular card or set of cards. # (Of a card) To win a trick although a higher card is outstanding. ;Hold up # (Verb) To defer taking a winning card until an advantageous point in the hand, usually in reference to tricks that the opponents have led to. There are various purposes for holding up a winner, but it is frequently done to force the opponents to use their entries too soon. # (Noun) The act of holding up a winner. ;Holding # The cards in a player's hand at a particular point in the play (often, at the start of the play). # The cards in a specific suit in a player's hand. ;Honor/honour, or honor/honour card: An ace, king, queen, jack or ten. ;Honors/honours, or honor/honour bonus: At rubber bridge and Chicago, a scoring bonus. The bonus is 100 points for one hand holding four of the five trump suit honors. The bonus is 150 points for all five trump suit honors, or all four aces in a notrump contract. ;Honor/honour tricks: A method of hand evaluation used in the Culbertson system, which assigns point values to honors and combinations of honors. AK is two honor tricks, AQ is 1 honor tricks, A or KQ is 1 honor trick, and Kx is honor trick. Similar in concept to quick tricks in the play of the hand. ;Hook: (Slang) Finesse (noun or verb). ;House player: An employee of a bridge club who is available as a fourth. ;Howell movement: A pairs tournament movement where each pair typically plays against all or most of the other pairs, and there is a single set of winners. Most of the pairs will move to a different position at the end of each round. ;Huddle # (Noun) A pause prior to a bid or play of longer than usual duration. # (Verb) To take that lengthy pause. ;HUM: Acronym or initialism for Highly Unusual Methods. I ;Idle: (Said of a card) Available as a discard; not required for purposes such as guarding the opponents' suit or interfering with their communications. ;IMP: Acronym for International Match Point. ;Impropriety: A breach of ethical conduct or etiquette; an action that violates the proprieties. ;IMPs: The form of duplicate bridge that uses International Match Points (IMPs) as a scoring method, as distinct from a game scored at matchpoints (MPs). ;In back of: :A card or holding that is to the left of, or behind, or over another. To say that the A is in back of the K is to say that the ace is to the left of the king, or behind it, or over it; so, the A is in a position to directly capture the K. ;Individual: A form of duplicate bridge, scored at matchpoints, in which each player is paired with a different partner on each round. ;Informatory double: A double that is intended to convey information rather than to exact a penalty from the opponents. Such doubles include the takeout double, the negative double, the support double, the responsive double and the lead-directing double, although the latter is intended to convey information and to penalize. ;In front of: :A card or holding that is to the right of or under another. To say that the A is in front of the K is to say that the ace is to the right of the king, or under it, and normally cannot capture the K if it is guarded. ;Insufficient bid: A bid that is not higher than the immediately preceding bid, and is therefore illegal. ;Insult: (Slang) The bonus for making a doubled or redoubled contract is sometimes referred to as the \\"insult\\" or as being \\"for the insult\\". ;Insurance bid: A bid, usually a sacrifice bid, intended to keep the opponents from playing their presumed or inferred optimum contract. The bidder hopes that insurance premium - the penalty due to the sacrifice bid - will be less than the damage from allowing the opponents to make their contract. ;Interference: A call, such as an overcall or an initial preempt, that is intended to make it more difficult for the opponents to bid to their best contract. ;Intermediate: 1) Nines, eights and sevens are sometimes termed \\"intermediate cards.\\" See body. :2) A jump overcall that by agreement may be made with a hand of opening bid strength and a long suit is termed an \\"intermediate jump overcall.\\" :3) An opening two-bid that by agreement may be made with values just short of those required for a game-forcing opening bid is termed an \\"intermediate two-bid.\\" ;International Match Point (IMP): :1) (Noun) A method of scoring in a teams match that compares a result on a board to that obtained at the other table and that converts the difference to IMPs using a table defined by WBF. The IMP scale's effect is to reduce the weighting of very large differences, thus making it less likely that the outcome of an entire match will depend on one board only. :2) (Verb) To perform the IMP score conversion. ;Intervenor: The first player on the other side to make a call other than pass when one side has opened the bidding. ;Intra-finesse: A technique that involves successive finesses against both opponents. ;Inverted minors: An agreement that treats the single raise of a minor suit as strong, and a double raise as preemptive. ;Invitation: A bid which invites the partner to bid on to game or slam if he has extra values. It is a non-forcing bid by definition. Compare semi-forcing bid. ;IPBM: International Popular Bridge Monthly, a British bridge magazine. ;Iron Duke, Not through the: A hackneyed phrase that describes the play of a high card by a player whose high card holding is led through; or, that player's statement. ;Irregularity: A breach of procedure, as described in the Laws and Proprieties, in bidding or play. If one is available, a director should be called to the table to make a ruling. ;Isolate: (Said of a menace card) To isolate a menace in squeeze play is to arrange that only one opponent can guard one of declarer's threat suits. The play is conceptually similar to transferring a control. J ;Jacoby transfer, or Jacoby, or \\"transfers\\": A bidding convention initiated by responder following partner's notrump opening bid that requests opener rebid in the suit ranked just above that bid by responder, i.e. a response in diamonds requests a rebid in hearts and a response in hearts requests a rebid in spades; other responses may carry other meanings; designed to make the stronger hand declarer. ;Jacoby 2NT: By agreement, a forcing raise of a major suit opening bid, used in conjunction with limit jump raises. Opener is requested to rebid in a suit where he holds a singleton so that responder can better evaluate the fit. ;Jam the bidding: (Slang) To preempt. ;Jettison: The discard of an honor, often by a defender, and usually to unblock a suit. ;Josephine: Grand slam force, an alternative term popular in Europe. The convention was developed by Ely Culbertson, and popularized in a late 1930s article by Josephine Culbertson in The Bridge World ;Journalist leads: Opening lead convention, mainly against notrump contracts, designed to show both what the leader has, and to request specific partner actions in return. ;Jump: #(Noun) A jump bid. #(Verb) To make a jump bid. ;Jump bid: A bid made at a level higher than the lowest level at which that suit could be legally bid. ;Jump overcall: An overcall made at higher than the minimally legal level: for example, 1 - (2). In the 1930s, jump overcalls were treated as strong bids. They are now more frequently treated as weak, preemptive bids. ;Jump preference: A preference to partner's first-bid suit, made at a level higher than the minimally legal level. In the following sequence, 3 is a jump preference: 1 - 1; 2 - 3. For many years, the jump preference was treated as invitational except in support of opener's minor, when it was treated as forcing. As of 2001, however, most experts treat all three-level jump preference bids as invitational following opener's one-level new-suit rebid: e.g., 1 - 1; 1 - 3 ;Jump raise: A raise of partner's suit one level higher than the minimum legal raise. For example, 1 - 3 or 1 - 1; 3 ;Jump rebid: A rebid of one's original suit, one level higher than necessary, usually showing a six-card suit: for example, 1 - 1; 3. The range of strength shown by a jump rebid is a matter of partnership agreement: some treat it as a one-round force, others (particularly if playing Kaplan–Sheinwold and the rebid suit is a minor) play it as only a little weaker than a game-forcing opening bid. ;Jump shift: A jump bid of a new suit. :1) As a rebid by opener (e.g. 1 – 1; 3) or responder (e.g. 1 – 1; 1NT – 3), it indicates extra strength :2) As direct response (e.g. 1 – 2): usually, a very strong hand. However, another treatment (weak jump shifts, requiring prior partnership agreement) uses the bid preemptively to show a weak hand and a long suit. ;Junior: A player under the age of 26. Various national, regional, and world competitions use this designation. K ;Kaplan–Sheinwold (K–S): A bidding system that uses five card majors and the weak notrump. ;Keycard Blackwood, or Key Card Blackwood (KCB): A variant of the Blackwood convention in which five keycards are counted, four aces plus the king of the apparent trump suit, rather than four aces alone. Commonly there is a follow-up to ask about the queen of trump (\\"Queen ask\\"), effectively the sixth keycard. ;Kibitzer: A spectator who attends a game in person. ;Kickback: An ace-asking or keycard- asking convention initiated by the first step above four of the apparent trump suit rather than uniformly by 4NT. Thus Kickback saves space when the trump suit is not spades. See Useful Space Principle and Blackwood: Asking bids other than 4NT. ;Kiss of death: At pairs, plus or minus 200. A score of minus 200, down two undoubled and vulnerable, or down one doubled and vulnerable, is a likely bottom against a part score by the opponents. A score of plus 200 from making five-odd of a major after stopping in a partial, is a likely bottom against the game contracts bid by other pairs holding the same cards. ;Knockout (KO), or Knockout Teams: A single-elimination tournament for teams- of-four. Routinely each round pairs all of the competing teams in head-to-head matches—win or lose; no draw or tie. Winners advance to the next round and losers are eliminated. The size of the field, or initial number of competing teams, must be a power of two. Only then, the format generates for each round an even number of teams, which enables a complete set of head-to-head matches. :Minor variants of great practical importance handle fields of any size by incorporating byes (definition 1) or matches with more than two teams (stipulated to have more than one winner, more than one winner, or both). :Two major variants are double knockout, in which teams are eliminated after losing two matches, and repechage, in which one-match losers drop into a secondary event from which some number of top performers return to the primary event. ;Knockout squeeze: A type of squeeze that operates in part against the defender's trump holding, when the defender threatens to win a plain suit trick and then lead a trump, thus reducing declarer's ruffing tricks. It is usual to call this play a knockout squeeze when the squeezed defender is second to play to the trick, and to call it a backwash squeeze when the squeezed defender is fourth to play. ;Kock–Werner Redouble: A rescue mechanism employed when partner's bid is doubled for penalties. Invented by Rudolf Kock and Einar Werner of Sweden. See also SOS Redouble. L ;Last Train: A conventional bid that is one step above the current bid and one step below game in a trump suit. It is a mild slam try and conveys no information about the suit bid. After 1 - 3; 4, 4 is Last Train, invites slam, and does not necessarily show a diamond control. ;Late play: A board that is played after the remainder of the event has finished, usually because of slow play or an irregularity. ;Law of Total Tricks (LTT), or \\"The Law\\" : A guideline stating that the total number of cards held by both sides in their longest trump fits equals the total number of tricks available to both sides in their best trump contracts. See Hand evaluation. :The Law is sometimes interpreted to mean that one side can profitably contract for a number of tricks equal to its own combined trump length; for example, compete to 3 with a nine-card spade fit. ;Laws of Contract Bridge and Laws of Duplicate Bridge: The definitions, procedures and remedies that define how rubber bridge and duplicate bridge are played. The Laws include the Proprieties, which discuss the game's customs and etiquette -- often far more important than procedural matters. The Laws apply worldwide. Individual sponsoring organizations, such as the ACBL and the EBL, establish their own regulations for play, which may amplify the Laws but may not conflict with them. :One important difference between the laws of rubber bridge (contract) and duplicate bridge is that rubber players are expected to deal with irregularities themselves while duplicate players are expected to call the director. ;Laydown: A contract that can be made on any rational line of play. ;Lead: 1) The first card played to a trick, which dictates the suit that others must play if able to do so (see follow suit). :2) The hand that is entitled to lead to the next trick is said to be \\"on lead\\" or to \\"have the lead.\\" :3) See opening lead. ;Lead-directing double: A double by the partner of the prospective opening leader that requests the lead of a particular suit. Experienced partnerships usually agree on a set of suit priorities, such as opening leader's bid suit, doubler's bid suit, dummy's first bid suit, or a suit that dummy has just bid conventionally. ;Lead out of turn: Playing a card when it was another player's turn to lead. Subject to penalty. ;Lead through strength: A maxim that advises a defender to lead a suit in which LHO has high card strength, forcing declarer to play high or low before third hand plays. The corollary is that a defender is advised to lead up to weakness in the fourth hand. ;Leap: To make a jump bid. ;Leaping Michaels: A conventional overcall in 4 or 4 made in defense to opposing 2-level or 3-level preemptive openings. Leaping Michaels shows a strong two-suited hand (5-5 or longer) that is less suitable for a takeout double and is game forcing. Described as an overcall by some of a weak two-bid of a major, others expand its application to all weak preempts at the 2 or 3-level in both the majors and minors. ;Leave in: To pass, often used of passing when partner's double was followed by a pass. ;Lebensohl (Leb): Responder's bid of 2NT as a puppet to 3 in preparation for a sign-off. Normally used after an overcall of partner's 1NT opening, or after a double of partner's weak two bid. Also used after opponents weak two bid and partner's balancing take-out double. ;Leg: (Slang) game. Normally used in reference to rubber bridge. \\"A leg up\\" means being vulnerable vs. non- vulnerable opponents. \\"Cut off their leg\\" means becoming vulnerable vs. opponents who are already vulnerable. ;Length: The number of cards held in a suit. ;Let through: (Slang) To allow a contract to make by misdefense. ;Level: 1) The number of tricks that (when added to the book of six tricks) a bid or contract states will be taken. For example, a bid at the four level contracts to take (6 + 4) = 10 tricks. :2) The property of a contract that states whether it is at the part-score, game or slam level. ;Lever: (Slang, verb) To double. (In Britain at least, a penalty double: Leave 'er in. The past participle \\"levered\\" means, doubled for penalties.) ;LHO:Left-hand opponent ;Light: (Adv.) To enter the auction with relatively low values (for example, to \\"open light\\" or \\"overcall light\\"). To do so can be either a matter of tactics or of general style. ;Lightner double: A penalty double, usually of a slam contract, that requests partner to choose an unusual suit for the opening lead. This criterion tends to regard as typical (and thus to exclude) a trump lead, the lead of defenders' bid suit, and the lead of an unbid suit. ;Limit: In the bidding, to define a hand's strength with some degree of precision. ;Limit Bid: A bid which establishes narrow limits on both the high card strength and distribution of the bidder's hand. In many bidding systems the following bid types are limit bids: (1) Natural notrump bids indicating balanced hands within a narrow high card strength range; (2) raises of partner's suit indicating a minimum number of cards in the raised suit, a narrow high card strength range, and likely ruffing values; or (3) rebids of one's own suit indicating a minimum suit length, an unbalanced hand, and a narrow high card strength range. ;Limit jump raise: An invitational jump raise of a major suit, such as 1 - 3. Limit jump raises usually guarantee at least an 8-card fit in partner's major suit and around 10-11 HCP or the distributional equivalent. ;Limit raise: Any call which invites partner to bid game in a suit partner has bid, previously. A limit raise promises trump support and hand strength about a king less than a minimum strength game force. ;Line: 1) (with \\"the\\"): A line on a bridge scorepad that separates points for tricks that count toward game (see Below the line) from those that do not (see Above the line). :2) On a given hand, the play strategy that is adopted by declarer or by the defenders. :3) Bidding: See Up the line and Down the line. ;Lock: 1) (Noun) A contract that is certain to succeed. :2) (Verb) To force a particular hand onto lead such that it cannot relinquish the lead unscathed. ;LOL: Little Old Lady (pronounced El-Oh-El). A facetious reference to a seemingly weak player. ;Long cards: Cards of the same suit, remaining in one hand, after all the other cards in that suit have been played from the other hands. ;Long hand: In a partnership, the hand with the longer trumps. ;Long suit: 1) In a hand, the suit with the greatest number of cards. Seldom used of a suit with fewer than five cards. :2) Any suit of unusual length. :3) Any suit of at least four cards. A four-card suit is likely to be called long when in context concerning a hand that is known to hold another suit, or even two, expected to be at least as long. ;Long suit game try: Following a major suit raise to the two level, the long suit game try names a suit with at least four cards, so that partner's cover card is useful regardless of length in the suit. A double fit is not unlikely and, if a major suit, that is a potential alternative trump suit. : 2) Alternative term for a help suit game try. In some usage the \\"help suit game try\\" is barely distinguishable from the long, in some barely distinguishable from the weak. ;Loser: A card which apparently cannot take a trick. ;Loser on loser: A card play tactic that attempts to create an advantage by playing two losers, often of different suits, on the same trick. Loser-on-loser play has many applications, including the creation of a ruffing position for declarer, the avoidance of overruffs by the defense, and interference with the opponents' communications. ;LROB: Limit Raise Or Better. Example: \\"1H-2NT = Heart-support, LROB.\\" ;Losing trick count (LTC): A method of hand evaluation based on counting losers. ;Love: No score. ;Low: (Adjective) A card that is not expected to take a trick. ;Low–high signal: On defense, to play a higher card, having already played a lower one, so as to convey information to partner.

M ;MacGuffin: A defensive card that, if retained, is a liability on one line of play, but that, if played, will be missed on another line of play. The term may be derived from the filmic plot device of the same name. ;Major penalty card: A card that is exposed by a defender prematurely and through intentional play; or, an honor card that is exposed prematurely even if accidentally. A major penalty card remains face up on the table to be played at the first legal opportunity, including as a discard. Contrast Minor penalty card. ;Major suit: The heart suit and the spade suit are major suits, often referred to simply as the majors. Declarer scores 30 points for each trick taken in an undoubled contract with a major suit as trump. Because game requires at least 100 points for tricks bid and made, both 4 and 4 (or 2 doubled and 2 doubled) constitute game contracts. Contrast Minor suits. ;Major tenace: The highest and the third highest remaining cards in a suit, held in the same hand. For example, the AQ before spades have been played. Tenaces define the structure of finesses. See minor tenace. ;Make: (Verb) To take at least as many tricks as a contract calls for. Frequently used in the past tense of the verb, i.e. Made. ;Mama–Papa: (Adjective) An unsophisticated game, approach to bidding, or line of play. ;Marionette Bid: (Noun) A type of relay bid in which the cheapest response is expected nearly all the time, thus similar but not identical to a puppet bid.

See comparative scoring. ;Matrix: The layout of the cards that play pivotal roles in certain endplays, most typically squeezes. ;Maxims: A maxim of bridge is a brief expression of a general principle of the game. Most Bridge maxims have some validity but none are true in all circumstances. ;Maximal overcall double: By prior agreement, a game- invitational double of an overcall that leaves no room for a bid, when a bid would invite game. For example, after 1 - (2) - 2 - (3) there is no room below 3 for a game invitation (and a bid of 3 itself would be taken as merely competitive), so a double is used as a game invitation. ;McKenney: See Suit preference signal. ;Menace: A card that requires an opponent to retain a higher card in the same suit, as a guard. The term is typically used of squeeze play. ;Merrimac coup: The deliberate sacrifice of a high card to remove a vital entry to an opponent's hand, usually the dummy.

A minor penalty card remains face up on the table until played. The minor penalty card must be played before any other card below honor rank in the same suit; however, an honor in the same suit may be played before the minor penalty card is played. Contrast Major penalty card. ;Minor suit: The club suit and the diamond suit are minor suits. Declarer scores 20 points for each trick taken in an undoubled contract with a minor suit as trump. Because game requires at least 100 points for tricks bid and made, both 5 and 5 (or 3 doubled and 3 doubled) constitute game contracts. Contrast Major suits. ;Minor tenace: The second-highest and the fourth-highest (or lower) remaining cards in a suit, held in the same hand. For example, the KJ before spades have been played.

Unless an arrow switch is performed, the effect is to create two events, a \\"North-South\\" contest and an \\"East-West\\" contest, with separate winning pairs, though a single winner can still be determined by comparing percentage results. ;Mixed: 1) Of an event: contested by pairs or teams in which every pair comprises one male and one female player. :2) In the auction: A mixed raise is, by agreement, a jump cue bid of opener's suit in support of partner's overcall. It tends to show four card support for partner's suit and the strength of a good single raise. In 1 - (1) - 1 - (3), 3 is a mixed raise. ;Morton's fork coup: A play that forces the defense to choose between taking a high card that will establish extra winners for declarer, and ducking the trick, after which the high card cannot be cashed. ;Movement: In a tournament, the scheme for the progression of players and boards from table to table, arranged so that a pair does not play the same boards twice, or meet the same opponents twice etc. The most common movements for pairs tournaments are Howell and Mitchell. ;Moysian fit: A 4–3 trump fit, or a contract with such a trump fit. Named after The Bridge World editor Alphonse \\"Sonny\\" Moyse Jr, who wrote and published a variety of articles that promoted the virtues of such fits or contracts, some bidding styles designed to locate them, and some techniques for playing them well. ;MUD: Acronym of \\"Middle, Up, Down\\", a lead convention which describes the sequence in which cards from a holding of three low ones (all less in rank than the 10) are played. ;Muiderberg convention: A weak two-bid showing 5 cards in a major and at least four cards in another suit. ;Multi: An ambiguous opening bid of 2 that promises one of several different types of hand. Originally entitled \\"multicoloured 2 Diamonds\\".

Contrast Artificial. ;NBB: Nederlandse Bridge Bond (Dutch Bridge League). ;Negative double: A conventional call used by responder in a competitive auction to denote possession of at least one unbid suit. ;Negative free bid: Responder's suit bid following an opening bid and an overcall. Nonforcing by prior agreement. ;Negative inference: An inference based on something that did not happen. For example, if a defender does not overruff, declarer might conclude that he could not overruff. Or if declarer does not ruff a loser in dummy, a defender might conclude that declarer does not have a loser in that suit. ;Negative response: A bid that shows insufficient values for a stronger response. For example, a 2 response to a forcing 2 opening bid is often negative, as is a 1 response to a Precision 1. ;Negative slam double: In a competitive auction, the double of a voluntarily bid slam to show no defensive tricks, and therefore to suggest a sacrifice. ;Neuberg formula: In duplicate pairs tournaments, a method of fairly adjusting match point scores when not all boards have been played the same number of times.

Also, \\"neither side vulnerable.\\" ; Norman four notrump: A slam- seeking convention ;North–South: One of the partnerships designated on duplicate boards. ;Not vulnerable: The state of vulnerability in which both bonuses and penalties are smaller. Therefore, less is at stake for a non- vulnerable pair investigating game or slam, or that is contesting the part score, than for a vulnerable pair. Also, \\"non-vulnerable.\\" ;Notrump, or no trump (NT): A contract, or a bid that names a contract without a trump suit. Notrump is the highest-ranking strain. WikiProject Contract bridge deprecates the two-word \\"no trump\\", however \\"no trump\\" is the usual spelling in the United Kingdom and in those European countries which have adopted this English term. ;Notrump distribution, no trump distribution, or NT distribution: Balanced distribution. WikiProject Contract bridge deprecates the two-word \\"No Trump\\". ;NPC, or npc: Non-playing captain. ;Nuisance bid: An interference bid whose principal aim is not to preempt or to compete for the contract, but nevertheless to upset the smooth flow of the opponents' bidding sequence. ;Number, as \\"go for a number\\": A very large penalty: \\"He went for a number.\\" Often, \\"telephone number\\", alluding to the size of that number if regarded as a quantity. (Dating back to the 1930s when UK telephone numbers were only four figures, plus an exchange name!) See also O ;Obligatory: 1) Of a finesse: A duck, made in the hope that a high card will fall. For example, declarer holds K432 opposite dummy's Q765. The 2 is led to the Q, which wins. Declarer now leads dummy's 5 and RHO follows with the J. Declarer ducks, hoping that LHO must now play the A. The play is obligatory because given the first heart trick, no other play can yield three tricks. :2) Of a falsecard: A falsecard that, like an obligatory finesse, cannot lose and might gain. An example is the play of the card that one is known to hold (for example, the play of a queen after it has been successfully finessed). ;Odd: Specifying a level. To make 4 is to make four-odd. ;Odd–even discards: A defensive carding scheme under which the play of an odd-numbered card is encouraging and that of an even-numbered card is discouraging.

ODR is not based on a mathematical formula, but refers to a player's judgement/perception of the hand. ;Off shape, offshape, or off-shape: Having a distribution that does not quite conform to that suggested by a bid, such as an opening bid of 1NT with 2=2=6=3 shape, or a weak-two bid with a seven card suit. ;Off the top: Said of some number of tricks that can be lost or won without gaining or losing the lead. \\"There were eleven tricks off the top in spades\\", to mean that declarer could take eleven tricks without interruption; or, \\"We're down off the top\\", to mean that the defenders can take at least four immediate tricks against 4. ;Offside: Unfavorably located, from the point of view of the player taking a finesse. If East holds the K and North the AQ, from South's point of view the K is offside.

For the WBF, transnational means open in sense (c). ;Opener: The player who makes the opening bid. ;Opener's rebid: Opener's second bid. ;Opening bid: The first bid in the auction. ;Opening lead: The first card led by defenders. The dummy is not faced until after the opening lead, which makes the choice of opening lead more difficult than other leads. The opening lead can determine the outcome of the deal. ;Opening leader: The declarer's LHO, who always makes the opening lead. ;Opponent: A member of the other partnership or team. ;Optimum contract: In unopposed bidding, the contract that cannot be improved upon by further bidding, nor could have been improved upon by taking a different line in earlier bidding.

To pass transfers the right to make the next call to passer's LHO, unless it is the third consecutive pass, which ends the bidding (but see Passed out). See also No bid. :2) To play, from third hand, a lower card than the one led to the trick. If declarer leads the J, LHO plays a small heart, and declarer plays the 2 from dummy's AQ2, declarer has passed the J. ;Pass and pull: To make a forcing pass and on the next round remove partner's double by bidding. ;Passed hand: A player who passed instead of opening the bidding.

The players proceed to the next deal. :2) A bid, double, or redouble (an action) is passed out if it is followed by three passes, which end the auction. The last action identifies the contract and the play follows. ;Passive defense: An approach to defending a hand that emphasizes waiting for tricks that declarer must eventually lose, getting off lead safely, and avoiding plays that will set up tricks for declarer. Often indicated when neither declarer nor dummy has a running side suit or when the declaring side may have over-reached in the bidding. Contrast Active. ;Pass-or-correct: A bid made in response to partner's ambiguous call. For example, South opens with 1 and West bids 2, by prior agreement showing hearts and a minor. North passes and East bids 3, expecting West to pass if he holds clubs and to correct to diamonds otherwise. ;Pass out: 1) To make the third of three consecutive passes following a bid, double or redouble. :2) To make the fourth of four consecutive passes. Thus, a bid cannot have been made and the table progresses to the next deal. :3) (Adjective) The seat where a pass would end the auction. ;Pattern: See distribution. ;Pearson points: High card points plus number of spades held. See Hand evaluation. ;Penalty: 1) A score awarded to the defense when declarer's contract goes down.

A raise from 1NT to 3NT based on a 4-3-3-3 hand with 10 HCP is a quantitative raise. :2) Of scoring: The method of scoring used in rubber bridge or in IMP events. The metric used is the number of points earned on each deal, perhaps adjusted by the IMP scale and victory points. In contrast, comparative scoring is based on the number of pairs that have been out-scored. ;Queen ask, or queen-ask: In Key Card Blackwood, the cheapest bid over the response to 4NT, to ask responder for the trump queen. ;Quick tricks: In card play, top ranking holdings able to win tricks immediately.

Losing the tricks \\"tightens up\\" the end position, removing idle cards from the defenders' hands before they can be used as safe discards in the squeezed position. ;Red: (Slang) Vulnerable. From the color of the paint on a duplicate board. Also: \\"Red vs. red\\" to mean both sides vulnerable, and \\"red vs. white\\" to mean vulnerable vs. not.

Also, \\"Result player\\" and \\"Second guesser\\". ;Retain the lead: Maintain the right to lead to the next trick by leading and winning the current trick. ;Return: To lead back, usually the suit that partner led. ;Reverse: A bidding sequence in which a single player, on consecutive calls, bids two different suits, and bids the two suits in the reverse order to that expected by the basic bidding system. The specific definition of a reverse therefore depends on the bidding system (see main article). The reverse is designed to show additional strength without the need to make a jump bid. Because the reverse takes up bidding space, the reverse bidder is usually expected to hold a stronger than average hand, usually more than 16 HCP. ;Revoke: Failure to follow suit as required when a player is able to do so. ;Rewind: (Slang) To redouble. ;RHO: Right-hand opponent. ;Rise, as \\"rise with\\": To play a high card in the hope of taking a trick: \\"Rise with the ace.\\" Also, \\"go up with\\" ;RKCB: Roman Key Card Blackwood, a slam bidding convention. ;Robert coup: A rare end position which combines elements of ruff and discard, trump shortening, and endplaying to force an opponent to concede a trump trick ;Roman: Descriptive of bids and carding agreements used or originated in the Roman system: #Roman 2 and 2: Three-suiters. #Roman Blackwood, Gerber and Roman Key Card Blackwood (RKCB): Step responses to the ace-asking bid that entail mild ambiguity. #Roman jump overcall: Two-suiter. #Roman asking bid: A request that partner bid his number of controls wholesale, via step responses. #Roman discards: odd-even discards. #Roman leads: Rusinow leads. ;RONF: Acronym for \\"Raise (is the) Only Non-Force\\".

See Useful Space Principle. ;Ruff: To play a trump on a trick when a plain suit was led. ;Ruff and discard: The lead of a suit in which both opponents are void, so that one opponent can ruff while the other discards (or sluffs). A ruff and discard is usually damaging to the side that leads to the trick. Also, ruff and sluff or ruff and slough. ;Ruff out: To establish a suit by ruffing one or more of its low cards. ;Rule of Eight: #Devised by Ely Culbertson. \\"The total of defensive honor-tricks that will be won at any bid (trump or no-trump) after each deal is about 8 out of the 13 tricks.\\" #A way to decide whether to overcall an opponent's 1NT opening. Length in long suits, the losing trick count and HCP are combined. #Devised by David Burn from experience of playing with and of captaining teams of junior players. (1) Subtract the number of aces held by opponents from eight. (2) Don't play at that level. ;Rule of Eighteen: Regulation by the World Bridge Federation stipulating that an opening bid is acceptable if the sum of the number of cards in the two longest suits plus the number of HCP is at least 18. ;Rule of Eleven: A calculation that can be used when it is assumed that opening leader has led the fourth highest card in a suit. By subtracting the pips on the card led from 11, the result is the number of cards in the other three hands that are higher than the one led. Third hand, for example, can then make inferences about declarer's holding in the suit by examining his own and dummy's holdings; likewise, declarer can make inferences about right-hand-opponent's holding in the suit. (The rule can be modified to subtract from 12 if the lead is thought to be third best, and from 10 if the lead is thought to be fifth best.) ;Rule of Fifteen: Guideline for opening light in fourth seat: open if your high card points plus your number of spades is 15 or more. Also known as the Cansino Count.Downey and Pomer, 2005, p. 31. ;Rule of Five: When the bidding has reached the 5-level in a competitive auction, tend to defend rather than bid on. In other words, in competitive auctions, 5-level contracts belong to the enemy. See also Law of Total Tricks ;Rule of Four: Avoid giving support for partner's 5-card suit if a superior 4-4 fit might be available. ;Rule of Seven: When declarer's only high card in the suit led by the opponents is the ace, count the number of cards in that suit held by declarer and dummy, subtract from seven and duck that many times. ;Rule of Three: On a competitive part score deal, with the points roughly equal between your side and theirs, once the bidding has reached the 3-level, tend to defend rather than bid on (unless your side has 9 trumps). See also Law of Total Tricks ;Rule of Twenty: A widely used guideline of the Standard American Yellow Card (SAYC) bidding system which states that a hand may open bidding \\"normally\\" (that is, by bidding one of a suit) if the sum obtained by adding the combined length of its longest two suits to its high card points is twenty or more, but that weaker hands must either open with a preempive bid or pass. See also Zar points evaluation method. ;Rule of Two: When missing two non-touching honors, it is normally superior to finesse first for their lower honor. In the following two example hands, three tricks or the maximum possible are needed. In the first hand, finesse the 10, not the Q. Similarly in the second, lead the 2 and when West follows with the 9, it is best to finesse the 10. When one of the missing honors is the 10 the rule will not apply, as one does not normally finesse for a 10 on the first round. ;Rule of Two and Three: A bidding guide suggested by Ely Culbertson, which counsels preemptors to be within two tricks of their contract if vulnerable, and within three if not. Few players now follow the Rule of Two and Three. ;Ruling: A finding and decision by a tournament director or appeals committee. ;Run: To play the winners in a suit. ;Rusinow leads: An agreement to lead the second highest of touching honors.

Contrast Percentage play, the best play in a suit, whereas a safety play is the best line for the contract. ;Sandbag: (Slang) To bid weakly or pass with good values, in the hope that the opponents will get overboard. ;Sandwich: An overcall made after an opening bid and response by the opponents. The overcall is \\"sandwiched\\" between two hands that have each shown strength. ;Save: (Slang) Sacrifice. ;SAYC: Standard American Yellow Card, a particular bidding system or the completed ACBL convention card that represents it. ;Scientific: A style of bidding that attempts to narrowly limit the strength of a partnership's hands, so as to make its bidding more accurate. ;Scissors coup: A loser-on-loser play meant to break the opponents' communications. Formerly known as 'Coup without a name'. ;Score, or bridge scoring: 1) The numeric result of a deal, session or event. :2) (Verb) Of a card, to win a trick: \\"The Q scored.\\" ;Score slip: A paper form used to record the result of each deal in a duplicate bridge event when electronic scoring devices are not available. Depending upon the event format, the score slip may be either a pick-up slip or a traveller. ;Scramble: 1) To bid to a safer contract. :2) To score small trumps by ruffing, rather than as long cards. Often used of the play of a contract based on a Moysian fit. ;Screen: A device which divides the table diagonally, visually separating partners from each other.

Declarer hopes that the cards are distributed in such a way that a superior line of play will fail. ;Short club: The natural opening bid of 1 when the suit contains three cards or less. Usually employed by players using the five- card majors treatment for opening bids when holding a hand with opening values but lacking a five-card major. When the hand contains two clubs and three diamonds, an opening diamond bid is preferred. Also, \\"short diamond.\\" These bids may also be called \\"prepared minors\\" - \\"prepared club\\" and \\"prepared diamond\\", or \\"better minor\\" bids. The EBU \\"Orange Book\\" recommends the term \\"prepared club\\" for bids that show a minimum of three cards, and \\"short club\\" where it may only be two cards or less. ;Short suit: 1) In a 13-card hand, a singleton or void suit. : 2) In a hand, that suit with the fewest cards. ;Short suit game try: By agreement, a bid of a short side suit after a single raise, hoping to reach game. For example, after 1 - 2, opener might rebid 3 with a singleton or void in clubs. The bid tells partner where high cards will be least useful, indicating duplication of values. It requests partner to take positive action with high-card strength outside that suit. Otherwise, the bid requests partner to sign off (in this example, by bidding 3). See help-suit game try and game try. ;Short-suit points: In hand evaluation, points counted for singletons and voids. ;Show out: Fail to follow suit. ;Shuffle: To mix the cards. Shuffling seldom results in random distributions: in the long run, the cards so mixed rarely match the mathematical expectancies. ;Side: Partnership. ;Side game: A secondary event played simultaneously with the main event. ;Side suit: A suit that is not trump; plain suit. A side suit may nevertheless have significant length: see Two-suiter. ;Signals: The conventional meanings assigned to plays made by the defenders in order to exchange information.

Compare non-forcing bid, forcing bid. ;Sign off: To make a signoff bid. ;Silent bidder: A sheet, typically of card or plastic, placed in the center of the table during the bidding period, and marked with numeral, suit and other symbols such that a player can indicate a call by tapping on them with a finger, writing implement, or the like. Largely superseded by bidding boxes. ;Simple squeeze: A squeeze against one opponent, in two suits, with the count (definition 3). ;Single dummy: The normal manner of play, with certain knowledge only of one's own cards and dummy's, and without verbal communication between partners.

The warning is made in one of two ways: : 1) When bidding boxes are in use, the red Stop card is placed on the table followed by a bid card; LHO is expected to wait 10 seconds before taking action; : 2) When bidding boxes are not in use, the jump bidder announces \\"I am about to make a skip bid, please wait.\\" and then bids. LHO waits 10 seconds. ;Slam: 1) small slam (or simply, slam): a contract to win at least twelve tricks. :2) grand slam: a contract to win all thirteen tricks. :Bidding and making a slam or grand slam scores significant bonus points. ;Slam try: A bid that invites partner to bid a slam. ;Slot: (Slang) The location of a card that is onside. \\"In the slot\\" means \\"Finessable.\\" ;Slough: Discard.

A hand with both good support for partner's trumps and a splinter can be very powerful offensively—offering control of the splinter suit (by ruffing the first or second trick) and extra trump winners (by ruffing subsequent rounds). When declarer holds either no top honors or the ace and low cards opposite a splinter in the dummy, the combined hands may win several more tricks than the partnership might have expected without awareness of the powerful fit. ;Splinter bid: An unusual jump bid that by agreement shows a fit for partner's last-bid suit and a singleton or void in the bid suit. For example, a partnership could treat 4 in response to an opening bid of 1 as a splinter bid, showing a good hand with spade support and a singleton or void club. Compare with Fragment bid. ;Split: 1) (Noun) The distribution in the opponents' hands of the cards in a suit. :2) (Verb) To play one of two touching honors when the lead comes through them. ;Split menace: A menace in squeeze play which depends on values in both declarer's hand and dummy. ;Split tenace: A position where the high cards of a tenace are in opposite hands, e.g. Ax opposite Qx; usually relevant only when a lead by an opponent with the missing honor card (here, the K) would be damaging to his side. ;Sponsor: 1) The organization that puts on a tournament, such as the WBF, the ACBL or the EBU, a regional association, or a club. :2) One who hires partners or teammates to compete in an event. ;Spot card: A card that ranks below the 10. ;Spread: (Slang) Laydown. ;SPS: A Suit Preference Signal, a card played by a defender to show interest in or an entry in a side suit. ;Squeeze: A playing technique that forces the defender(s) to discard a vital card, usually an apparent stopper. ;Squeeze card: A card whose lead forces one or both defenders to discard their guard in a suit. ;Stack: A distribution of cards in defenders' hands that might make the play difficult for declarer.

See Useful Space Principle. ;Step bid: A bid that conveys information on the basis of the number of steps it uses. ;Stolen bid: A bid that has no correlation to the bidder's hand, aiming to disturb conventions. ;Stepping-stone squeeze: A squeeze that forces a defender either to be thrown in to act as a stepping- stone to a stranded dummy, or to allow declarer to establish a suit. ;Sticks and wheels: (Slang, chiefly British) An 1100-point penalty. Compare \\"go for a number\\". ;Stiff: (Slang, adjective and noun) A singleton. ;Stop: An instruction given to opponents when you make a jump bid, or skip bid.

The doubler must be prepared to run (like the cowardly ape) to an escape suit if the opponents redouble. ;Strong club system: A set of conventions that uses an opening bid of 1 as an artificial, forcing opening that promises a strong hand. ;Strong notrump: An opening notrump that shows a balanced hand and 15-17 or 16-18 HCP. Contrast Weak notrump. A partnership's choice between the use of a strong notrump or a weak notrump has extensive implications for its entire bidding system. ;Strong pass system: A bidding system that mandates a pass by first (or second) hand to show what other systems would regard as an opening bid. A corollary is that if the next hand also passes, third (or fourth) hand must bid to keep the deal from being passed out. ;Strong two bid, strong two-bid, or Strong Two: An agreement to use an opening bid of two of a suit so as to indicate a strong hand and a strong holding in the bid suit. ;Stub: (Slang) Part-score. ;Sucker double: (Slang) An ill-advised penalty double, such as one based on HCP when the bidding warns of freak distributions. ;Suit: A ranked division of the deck of cards into (in descending rank order) spades, hearts, diamonds and clubs.

See also Denomination, Major suit, and Minor suit). ;Suit preference signal: A defensive carding method that signals a preference, or the lack thereof, for a suit other than the suit used for the signal. ;Superaccept: A strongly encouraging response to a transfer, such as a jump completion (e.g., 1NT - 2; 3). Many partnerships use a conventional superacceptance such as 1NT - 2; 2, one step above responder's major, to save room for game or slam exploration, and in conformance with the Useful Space Principle. ;Support: A fit with partner's suit. ;Support double: A double of an overcall that shows a fit for partner's suit, usually distinguished from a direct raise by the length of the suit in responder's hand. ;Sure trick: A trick that in the absence of some irregularity a player must win, such as the ace of trumps. Extended by George Coffin to refer to guaranteed lines of play. ;Surrogate signals: A count or preference signal made in a different suit, usually the suit which declarer is running, to inform partner in beforehand about a critical decision he will have to make later during the play of the hand. ;Swindle: A deceptive bid or play. ;SWINE: A proxi-acronym for Sebesfi Woods 1NT Escape. ;Swing: A difference in scores between two tables on a board in a team match. ;Swinging: An aggressive playing style, usually adopted by a pair or team who is behind with some chance to catch the leaders \\"with a little luck.\\" Swinging players will make plays slightly against the odds that will offer large gains if they succeed.

They might also make close doubles of normal contracts that might go down. ;Swish: (Slang) Three consecutive passes, ending the auction. \\"3 - swish\\" means 3 passed out. ;Swiss, or Swiss Teams: A Swiss-system tournament for teams-of-four. Every team plays a series of matches with a series of opponents whose records or standings are as similar as possible when they face each other, without scheduling repeat matches.

It is improper to take action on inferences made on the basis of partner's behavior. Also, \\"Table feel.\\" ;Table talk: 1) Improper communication between partners, effected by words, gestures, or facial expressions. :2) Extraneous discussion during the play, discouraged as a distraction or possible source of unauthorized information. ;Takeout double: A conventional call used in a competitive auction to indicate support for the unbid suits in a hand of opening strength, and to request that partner bid. The classic, ideal pattern is 4-4-4-1, with the shortness in the suit doubled. There are many informatory doubles that anticipate a bid from partner, but \\"takeout double\\" typically refers to the double immediately over opening bidder. ;Tank: (Slang) Huddle. ;Tap: (Verb and noun) Slang. To adopt a line of defense that is intended to force declarer to ruff in the long hand. Also, the line of defense itself: \\"To get the tap going.\\" See Forcing defense. ;Team: 1) (Adjective) (also Teams or Team(s)-of-four) A form of duplicate bridge played by eight people at two tables. The North–South pair at one table and East–West pair at the other table are teammates.

The suit in question is usually the suit immediately above the one bid. Examples: Jacoby transfers (often just called \\"transfers\\") and Texas transfers (\\"Texas\\"). Also, see transfer a control. ;Transferable values: Cards, such as aces and kings, that are valuable either in declarer's hands or in defenders'. ;Transfer a control: In squeeze play, to shift the responsibility of controlling, or guarding, a menace from one opponent to the other.

If the treatment is an unusual one, it requires announcement to the opponents even though it is natural. For example, a partnership that plays Flannery usually agrees that a 1 response to a 1 opening bid shows five spades. So the 1 response to 1, while natural, is a treatment because by agreement it shows at least a five card suit.

It is just a forcing bid to show an invitational hand. On the other hand, a rebid of 2 after a 1NT rebid is an artificial game force. ;Two-way Drury: An inquiry about the third (or sometimes fourth) position opener's strength in a major suit. 2 shows 3-card support, while an inquiry made with 2 shows four cards in opener's suit. ;Two-way finesse: A finesse that could be taken through either opponent. ;Two-way Stayman: Over an opening bid of 1NT, the use of 2 as non-forcing Stayman and 2 as a game-forcing major suit inquiry.

The underlead is standard in defense of notrump contracts (so as to preserve communications between defenders' hands), but unusual against suit contracts. ;Underruff: To play a trump lower than one already played on the lead of a plain suit. Usually this is undesirable but is sometimes necessary to adjust the number of trumps held while preparing a trump coup, or while preparing to defend certain squeezed positions. ;Undertrick: A trick that declarer does not win, causing the contract to go down. Multiple undertricks occur: for example, two undertricks could result in 4 down two. ;Unfinished rubber: A rubber that the players agree not to finish.

In duplicate bridge and Chicago, vulnerability is pre-determined for each board or deal; in rubber bridge, it is determined by the number of games completed in the rubber. Vulnerability affects both the size of bonuses for making contracts and penalties for failing to make them. ;Vulnerable: 1) (Duplicate bridge) A designation, shown on each board, that indicates whether larger bonuses and penalties apply to one, both or neither pair on that deal. :2) (Rubber bridge) Having won one game.

In some usage the \\"help suit game try\\" is barely distinguishable from the long, in some barely distinguishable from the weak. ;Weak two bid, weak two-bid, or Weak Two: An opening bid of two of a suit to indicate a relatively weak hand with a long suit. ;Whist: A trick-taking card game and predecessor to contract bridge. ;Wholesale: A count or total that obscures cards' identities. A bid of 5 in response to Blackwood shows two aces wholesale, without announcing which aces they are. ;Wide open: (Said of a suit) Without a stopper. ;Wide-ranging bid: A bid made within a wide range of strengths and shapes, the opposite of a limit bid. An example from Acol is an opening bid of one of a suit which may be made with anything from 10 HCP (plus some shape) to 22 HCP (with a shape unsuitable for a 2 bid, such as 4-4-4-1). Such bids are limited only by the failure of the bidder to make a stronger or weaker bid; thus an Acol opening bid of one of a suit is limited by the fact that the opener failed to pass, to make a 2 level opening bid, or to make a pre-emptive opening bid. ;Winkle: A squeeze without the count that forces the defender to choose between a throw-in and an unblock, each of which is a losing option. ;Winner: A card that can take a trick on a given hand. ;Wire: (Slang) Improper knowledge of a deal, prior to playing it. ;World Bridge Federation (WBF): The world sport governing body for bridge.

Z ;z: see Zoom. ;Zar points: An evaluation method to determine if a hand should be opened. It asks to open whenever you have 26 or more Zars, determined by adding the number of cards in the 2 longest suits, plus high card points, plus number of controls (A=2, K=1), plus the difference between the longest and the shortest suit. An additional point is added for the suit if it has 4+ cards. The unsupported honors are diminished 1 point in value. 52 Zar points should produce a NT or major suit game. ;Zero: The lowest score obtained on a deal in a pairs game.

Life Bubnov was born in Ivanovo-Voznesensk in Vladimir Governorate (now Ivanovo, Ivanovo Oblast, Russia) on 23 March 1883. into a local Russian merchant's family. He was expelled from Moscow University for revolutionary activities. He studied at the Moscow Agricultural Institute and while a student joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) in 1903. He was a supporter of the Bolshevik faction of the party. In summer 1905, he joined Ivanono-Voznesensk party committee, and was their delegate to the 4th (1906) and 5th (1907) Party Conferences in Stockholm and London. In 1907-08, he was a member of the RSDLP's Moscow committee, and of the Bolshevik committee for the Central Industrial Region. He was arrested in 1908. On his release from prison in 1909 Bubnov was made an agent of the Central Committee in Moscow. He was arrested again in 1910, and interned in a fortress. After his release in 1911, he was sent to organize workers in Nizhny Novgorod. From there, he was one of the organisers of the Prague Conference of January 1912, the first that excluded all RSDLP members who were not Bolsheviks. He was under arrest at the time of the conference, but in his absence was elected a candidate member of the first all-Bolshevik Central Committee. Afterwards he was sent to St Petersburg to assist in the launch of Pravda, and to work with the Bolshevik faction in the Fourth Duma. Arrested yet again, he was deported to Kharkov. On the outbreak of the First World War Bubnov became involved in the anti-war movement. He was but was soon arrested and deported to Poltava. He moved To Samara, where he was arrested in October 1916 - for the thirteenth time, in total - and exiled to Siberia. Bubnov returned to Moscow in 1917 after the February Revolution. He joined the Moscow Soviet and, at the 6th Party Conference in July 1917, he was elected to its central committee. In August, he moved to Petrograd. Just before the October Revolution, he was elected as one of the seven members of the first Bolshevik Politburo alongside Lenin, Zinoviev, Kamenev, Trotsky, Stalin, and Sokolnikov.Dmitri Volkogonov, Lenin. A New Biography, translated and edited by Harold Shukman (New York: The Free Press, 1994), p. 185. As a member of the Military Revolutionary Committee he helped organize the October Revolution, but in February 1918, he was of the leading members of the Left Communist faction, who opposed Lenin's decision to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, to end the war with Germany. During the Russian Civil War Bubnov joined the Red Army and fought on the Ukrainian Front. In 1921-22, he was posted in the North Caucasus. After the war he joined the Moscow Party Committee and became a member of the Left Opposition. Maria Ulyanova at the meeting of the workers and peasants news correspondents 1926 He was not always orthodox: The Party noted that he was with the \\"left-wing\\" in 1918, the \\"Democratic Centralists\\" in 1920–1, and the Trotskyites in 1923, when he signed their Declaration of 46. In January 1924, however, he switched to supporting Joseph Stalin and was rewarded by being appointed as Head of Political Control of the Red Army. From the 13th (1924) to 17th (1934) Party Conferences, he was elected to the central committee. Following the Canton Coup on 20 March 1926, he worked out an agreement with the new Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek. He then worked with Grigori Voitinsky and Fedor Raskolnikov on the \\"Preliminary Theses on the Situation in China\\", which was presented to the ECCI in November and December of that year. In 1929, he replaced Lunacharsky as People's Commissar for Education. As Commissar for Education, he ended the period of progressive, experimental educational practices and switched the emphasis to training in practical industrial skills. It was in this capacity that he attended the First All-Russian Museum Congress held in Moscow in December 1930.  Arrest and death  He was arrested by the NKVD during the Great Purge on 17 October 1937 and expelled from the Party Central Committee in November 1937. Records from the time, which were not made public until the 1980s and 1990s, show that he was sentenced to death on 1 August 1938 and shot the same day. The modus operandi of the Soviet regime was often to keep secret the real disposition of particular purged persons: whether internally exiled to a labor camp, sent to a psychiatric hospital (in which the regime disguised confinement and drugging as compassionate \\"health care\\"), or executed. It encouraged their families and the general public to believe that they were probably still alive in a camp or hospital somewhere. Bubnov was posthumously rehabilitated in February 1956 during the de-Stalinization of the Khrushchev thaw. However, even at the time, the Soviet government did not make public the lists of the purged persons who had already long been executed. Thus, their relatives were often still searching for them in various psychiatric hospitals in the 1970s, as was the case with Bubnov.

It was reclassified as Sporobolus anglicus after a taxonomic revision in 2014,Peterson, PM , et al (2014) A molecular phylogeny and new subgeneric classification of Sporobolus (Poaceae: Chloridoideae: Sporobolinae), Taxon 63: 1212-1243. but Spartina anglica is still in common usage. It is an allotetraploid species derived from the hybrid Spartina × townsendii, which arose when the European native cordgrass Spartina maritima (Small Cordgrass) hybridised with the introduced American Spartina alterniflora (Smooth Cordgrass). It is a herbaceous perennial plant growing 0.4-1.3 m tall, yellowish green in spring and summer, and turning light brown in autumn and winter. The leaves are 20–60 cm long, and 1.5 cm broad at the base, tapering to a point. It produces flowers and seeds on only one side of the stalk. The flowers are a yellowish-green, turning brown by the winter. Invasive problems Spartina anglica was at first seen as a valuable new species for coastal erosion control, its dense root systems binding coastal mud and the stems increasing silt deposition, thereby assisting in land reclamation from the sea. As a result, it was widely planted at coastal sites throughout the British Isles, and has colonised large areas of tidal mudflats, becoming an invasive species. New colonies may take some time to become established, but once they do, vegetative spread by rhizomes is rapid, smothering natural ecosystems and preventing birds like waders from feeding. In some areas however, a natural dieback of unknown cause has reversed the spread, and artificial control is no longer necessary where this dieback has occurred. It has also been introduced to Asia, Australia, New Zealand and North America, where it has proved to be a serious invasive species causing extensive damage to natural saltmarsh ecosystems in all areas.

It encompasses an area of 16,281 square miles (42,152 square kilometers). Its cathedral is St. Peter Cathedral in Marquette, which replaced Holy Name of Mary Pro-Cathedral at Sault Ste. Marie. In 2000, the number of registered Catholics in the diocese was 65,500. There were fifty-eight diocesan priests and 11 religious at 74 parishes and 23 missions. There were 10 parish grade schools. Sixty-three women religious were also in service to the diocese.  History  Holy Name of Mary Pro-Cathedral Pope Pius IX separated territory from the Diocese of Detroit, to create the Vicariate Apostolic of Upper Michigan on July 29, 1853. On January 9, 1857, he raised the Vicarate to the status of a Diocese, as the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sault Sainte Marie. In 1865, Bishop Baraga transferred the See city to Marquette, and requested it be renamed the Diocese of Sault Ste. Marie and Marquette. In 1937 it became simply the Diocese of Marquette, and the Diocese of Sault Sainte Marie became a titular see. As early as the 17th century, Jesuit missionaries from France traveled to the Upper Peninsula to evangelize the Native American population. The first Catholic Mass in the Upper Peninsula was celebrated in 1641 by St. Isaac Jogues, in the area that would later become Sault Ste. Marie. The first resident pastor was noted missionary Jacques Marquette, who arrived in 1668. Marquette founded Michigan's first European settlement, Sault Ste. Marie, and later founded St. Ignace, Michigan. Other Jesuits would follow, and maintain a presence throughout the years. Father Frederic Baraga settled at L'Anse in 1843, after forming Catholic missions in Wisconsin. He would devote the rest of his life to evangelizing in the Upper Peninsula. He later would become the first Bishop of the newly formed diocese, in 1857. In 1953, on the 100th anniversary of the diocese being named a Vicariate Apostolic, a centennial Mass was held in Marquette on August 30. In 2020, former Diocese of Marquette priest Gary Allen Jacobs was arrested in New Mexico and charged with 10 criminal charges, including eight counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and two counts of second-degree criminal sexual conduct, from his time in the Diocese of Marquette.https://upnorthlive.com/news/local/sex-crimes- case-of-former-up-priest-gets-sent-to-circuit-court  Churches   Bishops  = Bishops of Sault Sainte Marie–Marquette = # Ireneus Frederic Baraga (appointed, 29 July 1853; died in office, 19 January 1868) # Ignatius Mrak (appointed, 25 September 1868; resigned, 28 April 1879) # John Vertin (appointed, 16 May 1879; died in office, 26 February 1899) # Frederick Eis (appointed, 7 June 1899; resigned, 8 July 1922) # Paul Joseph Nussbaum, C.P.

The commune is composed of three villages: *Dobolii de Jos / Aldoboly *Ilieni / Illyefalva *Sâncraiu / Sepsiszentkirály Demographics The commune has an absolute Székely Hungarian majority. According to the 2011 census it has a population of 2,028 of which 87.03% or 1,765 are Hungarian. History There is archaeological evidence of the area having been populated since the Bronze Age. The place was first time mentioned in a church tax inventory as \\"Villa Helye\\" in 1332. In the Middle Ages, having the rights of a market town, the settlement was more important than today. The abundance of arable lands in the area (within the historical Háromszék region), and trade relations with nearby Saxon settlements, including Braşov, contributed to the sound economic basis of the community. Also resulting from its geographical location, the Székely settlement, during its history, was often subject to foreign military campaigns. The most tragical of these attacks was in 1658, when the fortified church of the village was successfully conquered by allied Turkish and Moldavian forces, who killed all the defending fighters and threw their bodies into the well of the stronghold. Surviving villagers were taken to custody. Since the fall of communism in 1989, the local community has been successful in developing viable economic activities, mostly based on agriculture and food industry, but a conference centre, a youth hostel and guest houses in the area also contribute to the revival of the settlement. Fortified church The time when the church was built is not recorded. It was rebuilt in the 15th century in Gothic style, later Renaissance and Baroque renovations were made. Following a series of Tatar, Saxon and Turkish attacks the church was gradually fortified during the 15th-17th centuries. Smaller-scale earthquakes in the region also made regular renovations necessary. One of the strongest quakes recorded in 1802 seriously damaged the building and its painted wooden ceiling. The church building was renovated in the 1990s.

The festival is at the Sri Visalakshi Sametha Sri Viswanatha Swamy temple where the deities are Lord Siva (Lord Viswanatha) and his consort Visalakshi, another name for Parvati. The annual ten-day chariot festival conducted here during the month of November is one of the most remarkable festivals of Kerala. Vedic recitals and cultural programmes are held in the temple during the first four days of the festival. This is believed to be over 700 years old. On the last three days, thousands of devotees gather together to draw decorated temple chariots through the streets. The ancient temple nestles by the banks of the Kalpathy river which is also known as the Nila river. The temple dates back to 1425. The similarities to the famous Varanasi Kashi Vishwanath temple on the banks of the Ganges in North India gives this temple the moniker: kasiyil pakuthi kalpathy—Kalpathy is half Kashi. Kalpathi (Kalpathy), as the village or agraharam in which the temple is situated is known, is an early Tamil Brahmin settlement.

It was built around 1425 AD.by Kombi Achan, the then Raja of Palakkad. Legend has it that a Brahmin widow named Lakshmiammal went to Banaras and brought Lingam and installed in the present site on the Southern bank of river Neela Bhagirathi. The location of the temple and steps leading to the river brings mind of a visitor the Banaras Temples on the bank of Ganges. Hence this temple is called \\"Kasiyil Pakuthi Kalpathy\\" (Half Banaras). Kalpathy Car Festival is based on vedic Tamil Brahmin culture. The main centre of the festival is Kalpathy Sree Viswanathaswamy temple. The three satellite temples in the village of new Kalpathy, old Kalpathy and Chathapuram also celebrate the festival this period. The festival is celebrated over a period of 10 days. The Festival The festival is conducted over a period of 10 days, usually 8 to 16 November. During this time, 6 chariots (rathas) from 4 temples of Kalpathy come together and circumvent streets of the villages in a grand procession. The 4+2 as follows: main chariot carrying Lord Shiva and additional 2 small chariots for his sons, Ganapathy and Murugan; chariots from the other 3 villages namely New Kalpathy with Lord Ganapathy, Old Kalpathy with Lord Krishna and Chathapuram with Lord Ganapathy. This is known as 'devarathasamgamam'.

The subtitle is \\"Australia's Magazine of Industrial and Narrow Gauge Railways\\". History The LRRSA started in the 1961 to foster interest in specialty railways such as for industry and tourism. As it originated in Victoria, much of its focus was at first on the timber tramways and other industrial railways of that state. Light Railways is credited as the most comprehensive source for research and history of timber tramways, the sawmilling industry and other light rail-using industries for the period 1850 to 1950,Australia and New Zealand Forest Histories Short Overviews, Edited by John Dargavel, Australian Forest History Society Inc. Occasional Publications, No. 1 p.44 It has been credited with publishing the most thorough research on light railways in not just Australia, but worldwide.Griffiths, T. (1992) Secrets of the Forest: Discovering History in Melbourne's Ash Range, Allen & Unwin, St Leonards NSW, pages 88-90. The genesis of Light Railways magazine dates from 1960 when the founder of LRRSA, Frank Stamford, began printing and distributing among a small group of friends a duplicated \\"Shenley Valley Railway Quarterly Review\\". It gradually began to specialise in light railways, and became the \\"VLRRS Quarterly Review\\" in 1961. In 1963, it became \\"Light Railways\\", appearing in magazine format, but still using duplicated printing. Offset printing came in 1968 and from 1973 it appeared as a magazine with photographs on the front cover, continuing as a quarterly. Up until 1977, Light Railways contained brief news items as well as historical articles. In November 1977, a bi-monthly news publication, Light Railway News, was launched, containing research and site notes and news of industrial, heritage and tourist railways. This settled down into a simple folded A4 format and continued for 120 issues as a companion publication to \\"Light Railways\\" until 1997. At this point, LRRSA Council decided upon a bold new departure to reinvigorate the Society. It would involve combining \\"Light Railways\\" and \\"Light Railway News\\" into a new bi-monthly \\"Light Railways\\" magazine, in A4 format and with ample use of colour. This magazine would not only be available on subscription but would also be distributed through newsagencies throughout Australia. A new editorial team of Bruce Belbin, Bob McKillop and John Browning was put together and the new format magazine began with No.139 in February 1998.  Aims  Light Railways aims to document the history of Australia's industrial and private railways and also the government lines that were built to a narrower gauge than that adopted as \\"standard\\" in each state. Thus the gauge lines of Victoria, the gauge Innisfail Tramway in Queensland, and Zeehan & NE Dundas line in Tasmania have all featured. Articles and photographs constitute a comprehensive archive of Australia's industrial and narrow gauge railway history. Production, editorial and research standards are high. Coverage extends to lines in surrounding countries where Australian economic and political influence prevailed, including Papua New Guinea, Fiji and the phosphate islands of the Pacific. A range of well-researched articles remains the core content of the magazine. Industrial Railway News reports cover Australia's still existing industrial railways and feature Queensland sugar cane railways and the Pilbara iron ore railways as well as other remaining lines. Heritage and Tourist reports at the end of each issue constitute a running record of details that are otherwise difficult to locate. Topics include museums, railways and heritage issues. Research assists readers with historical research projects and features site visits and tours. Letters to the Editor are a lively source of information and discussion while Book Reviews aim to cover all significant relevant publications from Australia or overseas.  Distribution The LRRSA also has its meetings in Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, and Sydney notified in the magazine, as well as a range of coming events on tourist and heritage railways. It is distributed to LRRSA members by a Society team based in Melbourne and to newsagents by Gordon & Gotch.Membership Form A listing of past articles can be found by following the link from \\"Publications\\"Publications All past issues can be purchased in either hard copy or as downloadable .pdf files from the web.LRRSA  See also  * History of rail transport in Australia * List of railroad-related periodicals Notes  Issue  * October 2009 was Number 209. * April 2013 was Number 230.

They were the first frigates to have the \\"V\\" form hull. This evolutionary design made it possible to be driven in head sea without the usual slamming which occurs with conventional destroyers of the time. Each frigate cost 3.5 million pounds and the first ship completed was Torquay in May 1956. Design The Whitbys were designed as specialist anti-submarine warships, intended to counter fast modern diesel-electric submarines. As such, the design was required to reach a speed of at least , maintaining high speed in rough weather conditions and have a range of at . To meet these requirements, the Type 12s had a new hull form and, unlike the contemporary Type 41 anti-aircraft and Type 61 air direction frigates, were powered by steam turbines. Torquay was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a draught of forward and at the propellers. The ships were powered by the new Y-100 machinery in which the ship's boilers and steam turbines were designed as a closely integrated set of machinery to increase efficiency. Two Babcock & Wilcox water-tube boilers fed steam at and to two sets of geared steam turbines which drove two propeller shafts, fitted with large ( diameter) slow-turning propellers. The machinery was rated at , giving a speed of . Crew was about 189 when operated as a leader and 152 as an ordinary ship. A twin 4.5-inch (113 mm) Mark 6 gun mount was fitted forward, with 350 rounds of ammunition carried, with close-in armament of a stabilised STAAG (Stabilised Tachymetric Anti-Aircraft Gun) twin Bofors 40 mm L/60 gun mount aft. The design anti-submarine armament consisted of twelve 21-inch torpedo-tubes (eight fixed and two twin rotating mounts) for Mark 20E Bidder homing anti- submarine torpedoes, backed up by two Limbo anti-submarine mortars fitted aft. The Bidder homing torpedoes proved unsuccessful however, being too slow to catch modern submarines, and the torpedo tubes were soon removed. The ship was fitted with a Type 293Q surface/air search radar on the foremast, with a Type 277 height-finding radar on a short mast forward of the foremast. A Mark 6M fire control system (including a Type 275 radar) for the 4.5 inch guns was mounted above the ship's bridge, while a Type 974 navigation radar was also fitted. The ship's sonar fit consisted of Type 174 search, Type 170 fire control sonar for Limbo and a Type 162 sonar for classifying targets on the sea floor. Operational Service Torquay was laid down at Harland & Wolff's Belfast shipyard on 11 March 1953. The ship was launched on 1 July 1954, and completed on 10 May 1956. On commissioning Torquay joined the 5th Frigate Squadron based at Portsmouth, becoming leader of the squadron on 28 August that year. She left for the Mediterranean at the end of October and took part in the Suez operation in November 1956. In December Torquay carried out patrols off Cyprus, and remained in the Mediterranean in the early part of 1957, returning to Portsmouth on 16 May 1957. In 1958 she was diverted to Tobruk following the assassination of the Iraqi Royal Family. Between 1967 and 1971 Torquay was one of the frigates allocated to the Dartmouth Training Squadron and between 1972 and 1985 Torquay served as a navigation training ship based in Portsmouth. In 1971 the ship was refitted with a solid main mast (as opposed to a lattice mast) and a large training navigation room was built where the forward set of triple-barrelled mortars used to be located (leaving one set of mortars). She was also fitted to undertake trials of CAAIS (Computer Assisted Action Information System). Torquay attended the 1977 Silver Jubilee Fleet Review off Spithead when she was part of the 2nd Frigate Squadron.Official Souvenir Programme, 1977. Silver Jubilee Fleet Review, HMSO Replaced by the as the navigation training vessel for the Royal Navy, Torquay paid off on 23 March 1985. At the time she was the longest serving ship of her class and the oldest frigate in the fleet. She was sold for scrap in 1987 and left Portsmouth on 1 July 1987 to be broken up in Barcelona, Spain. Notable individuals who commanded Torquay at some point in her history include Peter Berger, Fabian Malbon and John McAnally.

Informally, the Damerau–Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of operations (consisting of insertions, deletions or substitutions of a single character, or transposition of two adjacent characters) required to change one word into the other. The Damerau–Levenshtein distance differs from the classical Levenshtein distance by including transpositions among its allowable operations in addition to the three classical single-character edit operations (insertions, deletions and substitutions). In his seminal paper, Damerau stated that in an investigation of spelling errors for an information- retrieval system, more than 80% were a result of a single error of one of the four types. Damerau's paper considered only misspellings that could be corrected with at most one edit operation. While the original motivation was to measure distance between human misspellings to improve applications such as spell checkers, Damerau–Levenshtein distance has also seen uses in biology to measure the variation between protein sequences.The method used in:  Definition  To express the Damerau–Levenshtein distance between two strings a and b a function d_{a,b}(i,j) is defined, whose value is a distance between an i–symbol prefix (initial substring) of string a and a j–symbol prefix of b. The restricted distance function is defined recursively as:, \\\\qquad d_{a,b}(i,j) = \\\\min \\\\begin{cases} 0 & \\\\text{if } i = j = 0  d_{a,b}(i-1,j) + 1 & \\\\text{if } i > 0  d_{a,b}(i,j-1) + 1 & \\\\text{if } j > 0  d_{a,b}(i-1,j-1) + 1_{(a_i eq b_j)} & \\\\text{if } i, j > 0 d_{a,b}(i-2,j-2) + 1 & \\\\text{if } i, j > 1 \\\\text{ and } a[i] = b[j-1] \\\\text{ and } a[i-1] = b[j] \\\\end{cases} where 1_{(a_i eq b_j)} is the indicator function equal to 0 when a_i = b_j and equal to 1 otherwise. Each recursive call matches one of the cases covered by the Damerau–Levenshtein distance: * d_{a,b}(i-1,j) + 1 corresponds to a deletion (from a to b). * d_{a,b}(i,j-1) + 1 corresponds to an insertion (from a to b). * d_{a,b}(i-1,j-1) + 1_{(a_i eq b_j)} corresponds to a match or mismatch, depending on whether the respective symbols are the same. * d_{a,b}(i-2,j-2) + 1 corresponds to a transposition between two successive symbols. The Damerau–Levenshtein distance between and is then given by the function value for full strings: d_{a,b}(a,b) where i=a denotes the length of string and j=b is the length of .  Algorithm  Presented here are two algorithms: the first, simpler one, computes what is known as the optimal string alignment distance or restricted edit distance, while the second one computes the Damerau–Levenshtein distance with adjacent transpositions. Adding transpositions adds significant complexity. The difference between the two algorithms consists in that the optimal string alignment algorithm computes the number of edit operations needed to make the strings equal under the condition that no substring is edited more than once, whereas the second one presents no such restriction. Take for example the edit distance between CA and ABC. The Damerau–Levenshtein distance LD(CA,ABC) = 2 because CA → AC → ABC, but the optimal string alignment distance OSA(CA,ABC) = 3 because if the operation CA → AC is used, it is not possible to use AC → ABC because that would require the substring to be edited more than once, which is not allowed in OSA, and therefore the shortest sequence of operations is CA → A → AB → ABC. Note that for the optimal string alignment distance, the triangle inequality does not hold: OSA(CA,AC) + OSA(AC,ABC) < OSA(CA,ABC), and so it is not a true metric. = Optimal string alignment distance = Optimal string alignment distance can be computed using a straightforward extension of the Wagner–Fischer dynamic programming algorithm that computes Levenshtein distance. In pseudocode: algorithm OSA-distance is input: strings a[1..length(a)], b[1..length(b)] output: distance, integer let d[0..length(a), 0..length(b)] be a 2-d array of integers, dimensions length(a)+1, length(b)+1 // note that d is zero-indexed, while a and b are one-indexed. for i := 0 to length(a) inclusive do d[i, 0] := i for j := 0 to length(b) inclusive do d[0, j] := j for i := 1 to length(a) inclusive do for j := 1 to length(b) inclusive do if a[i] = b[j] then cost := 0 else cost := 1 d[i, j] := minimum(d[i-1, j] + 1, // deletion d[i, j-1] + 1, // insertion d[i-1, j-1] + cost) // substitution if i > 1 and j > 1 and a[i] = b[j-1] and a[i-1] = b[j] then d[i, j] := minimum(d[i, j], d[i-2, j-2] + 1) // transposition return d[length(a), length(b)] The difference from the algorithm for Levenshtein distance is the addition of one recurrence: if i > 1 and j > 1 and a[i] = b[j-1] and a[i-1] = b[j] then d[i, j] := minimum(d[i, j], d[i-2, j-2] + 1) // transposition = Distance with adjacent transpositions = The following algorithm computes the true Damerau–Levenshtein distance with adjacent transpositions; this algorithm requires as an additional parameter the size of the alphabet , so that all entries of the arrays are in : algorithm DL-distance is input: strings a[1..length(a)], b[1..length(b)] output: distance, integer da := new array of Σ integers for i := 1 to Σ inclusive do da[i] := 0 let d[−1..length(a), −1..length(b)] be a 2-d array of integers, dimensions length(a)+2, length(b)+2 // note that d has indices starting at −1, while a, b and da are one-indexed. maxdist := length(a) + length(b) d[−1, −1] := maxdist for i := 0 to length(a) inclusive do d[i, −1] := maxdist d[i, 0] := i for j := 0 to length(b) inclusive do d[−1, j] := maxdist d[0, j] := j for i := 1 to length(a) inclusive do db := 0 for j := 1 to length(b) inclusive do k := da[b[j ℓ := db if a[i] = b[j] then cost := 0 db := j else cost := 1 d[i, j] := minimum(d[i−1, j−1] + cost, //substitution d[i, j−1] + 1, //insertion d[i−1, j ] + 1, //deletion d[k−1, ℓ−1] + (i−k−1) + 1 + (j-ℓ−1)) //transposition da[a[i := i return d[length(a), length(b)] To devise a proper algorithm to calculate unrestricted Damerau–Levenshtein distance note that there always exists an optimal sequence of edit operations, where once-transposed letters are never modified afterwards. (This holds as long as the cost of a transposition, W_T, is at least the average of the cost of an insertion and deletion, i.e., 2W_T \\\\ge W_I+W_D.) Thus, we need to consider only two symmetric ways of modifying a substring more than once: (1) transpose letters and insert an arbitrary number of characters between them, or (2) delete a sequence of characters and transpose letters that become adjacent after deletion. The straightforward implementation of this idea gives an algorithm of cubic complexity: O\\\\left (M \\\\cdot N \\\\cdot \\\\max(M, N) \\\\right ), where M and N are string lengths. Using the ideas of Lowrance and Wagner, this naive algorithm can be improved to be O\\\\left (M \\\\cdot N \\\\right) in the worst case, which is what the above pseudocode does. It is interesting that the bitap algorithm can be modified to process transposition. See the information retrieval section of for an example of such an adaptation.  Applications  Damerau–Levenshtein distance plays an important role in natural language processing. In natural languages, strings are short and the number of errors (misspellings) rarely exceeds 2. In such circumstances, restricted and real edit distance differ very rarely. Oommen and Loke even mitigated the limitation of the restricted edit distance by introducing generalized transpositions. Nevertheless, one must remember that the restricted edit distance usually does not satisfy the triangle inequality and, thus, cannot be used with metric trees. = DNA = Since DNA frequently undergoes insertions, deletions, substitutions, and transpositions, and each of these operations occurs on approximately the same timescale, the Damerau–Levenshtein distance is an appropriate metric of the variation between two strands of DNA. More common in DNA, protein, and other bioinformatics related alignment tasks is the use of closely related algorithms such as Needleman–Wunsch algorithm or Smith–Waterman algorithm. = Fraud detection = The algorithm can be used with any set of words, like vendor names. Since entry is manual by nature there is a risk of entering a false vendor. A fraudster employee may enter one real vendor such as \\"Rich Heir Estate Services\\" versus a false vendor \\"Rich Hier State Services\\". The fraudster would then create a false bank account and have the company route checks to the real vendor and false vendor. The Damerau–Levenshtein algorithm will detect the transposed and dropped letter and bring attention of the items to a fraud examiner. = Export control = The U.S. Government uses the Damerau–Levenshtein distance with its Consolidated Screening List API.http://developer.trade.gov/consolidated- screening-list.html  See also  * Ispell suggests corrections that are based on a Damerau–Levenshtein distance of 1 * Typosquatting  References   Further reading  * Category:String similarity measures Category:Information theory Category:Dynamic programming Category:Similarity and distance measures ","title":"Damerau–Levenshtein distance"},{"id":"3417640","text":"Martin's may refer to:  Retailers  *Martin's Super Markets, a grocery chain headquartered in South Bend, Indiana *Martin's Food Markets, a grocery chain operated by Giant-Carlisle *Martin's (Newsagent), UK newsagent *Martin's (New York), a specialty apparel retailer in the New York metropolitan area ","title":"Martin's"},{"id":"3417658","text":"Fred Wise (May 27, 1915 – January 18, 1966) was the co-writer of the lyrics to the 1948 song \\"'A' — You're Adorable\\" with Buddy Kaye and Sid Lippman.

A communist political activist during his early years, Herberg gained wider public recognition as a social philosopher and sociologist of religion, as well as a Jewish theologian. He was a leading conservative thinker during 1950s and an important contributor to the National Review magazine. Biography = Early years = William Herberg, commonly known as \\"Will,\\" was born on June 30, 1901 to a Jewish family in the shtetl of Lyakhavichy, Belarus, located near the city of Minsk in what was then part of the Russian Empire.Harry J. Ausmus, Will Herberg: From Right to Right. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1987; pg. 1. His father, Hyman Louis Herberg (1874-1938) and mother, the former Sarah Wolkow (1872-1942) were themselves born in the same provincial village. Although no records remain to document the family's financial status, Herberg's biographer indicates that the family was not impoverished, with his father the recipient of a gymnasium education and successful enough as an electrical contractor to pay for the family's emigration from the anti-semitic Tsarist regime to a new life in America in 1904. Arriving in New York City, the Herberg family took up residence in an poor Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. The family's economic position deteriorated in America, however, and Will's parents were divorced about ten years after arriving in the United States, with Will and his younger brother raised by his mother, who earned money as a housekeeper and small-scale manufacturer of knit fabric belts.Ausmus, Will Herberg, pg. 2. The boys aided the family income by helping with belt-making, although a very high priority was placed by his mother on education, and great financial sacrifices were made to ensure that the two boys stayed on an academically- oriented path. Will attended public school in Brooklyn, entering the prestigious Boys' High School in February 1915. During his high school years, Herberg demonstrated great capacity as a student, studying mathematics, physics, German, Hebrew, and French, while writing poetry in his spare time. Herberg graduated from Boys' High School in June 1918 and entered the tuition- free City College that same fall. While at City College, Herberg studied mathematics, English literature, and various physical sciences, developing a keen interest in psychology and the writings of Sigmund Freud. While his grades in these subjects were above average, he had difficulty with requirements in physical education and exhibited an antipathy to required courses in military science.Ausmus, Will Herberg, pp. 2-3. Herberg would be suspended from City College in the fall of 1920 due to frequent absences from military science class, accentuated by an altercation by the officer in charge of the course.Ausmus, Will Herberg, pg. 3. Herberg would finish his career at City College having completed 94 of the 131.5 credits needed for graduation. Although he never graduated from the Baccalaureate program at City College, Herberg would later falsely claim to have degrees from Columbia University, including a PhD in 1932. However, he later received three honorary doctorates, the first in 1956.The Encyclopedia of Religion and Society =Political radicalism= The exact timetable of Will Herberg's radicalization is unclear; according to his brother, Ted Herberg, Will's difficulty with the military science officer, his subsequent dismissal from college, and the troubled financial situation of his family led him to the ideas of revolutionary socialism.Cited in Ausmus, Will Herberg, pg. 3. Be that as it may, by 1925 Herberg was a prominent member of the Young Workers League (YWL) — youth section of the Workers (Communist) Party — and a contributor to the group's weekly newspaper, The Young Worker. In the fall of 1925, Herberg was elected a delegate by YWL District 2 (New York City) to the organization's 3rd National Convention, held in Chicago. The 3rd Convention of the YWL elected Herberg to the governing National Executive Committee, as part of which he served as director of \\"Agitprop\\" (Agitation and Propaganda). Herberg was also named a member of a four-member editorial committee for The Young Worker, taking over as chief editor of that publication for acting editor Max Shachtman effective with the issue of November 7, 1925. In 1925, Herberg married a YWL comrade, the former Anna Thompson, a resident of Brownsville, Brooklyn. The couple would intellectually compatible throughout Herberg's long ideological journey from communist youth journalist to conservative political writer and prominent Jewish theologian. The couple did not have children. Following the split of party leader Jay Lovestone and his cothinkers in 1929, Herberg remained loyal to them, a decision earning his expulsion from the party on September 10, 1929.\\"Denounces Provocative Acts of Lovestone Gang,\\" Daily Worker, vol. 6, no. 162 (Sept. 13, 1929), pg. 4. Thereafter Herberg joined the so-called Lovestoneites, remaining with that organization until its termination at the end of 1940, serving as editor of the group's weekly newspaper, Workers Age.Gaston, \\"The Cold War Romance of Religious Authenticity,\\" pp. 1137-1138. =Protestant, Catholic, Jew= He later turned away from Marxism and became a religious conservative, founding the quarterly Judaism with Robert Gordis and Milton R. Konvitz. During the 1960s, he was the religion editor of the conservative journal National Review, and he also taught at Drew University. Herberg's 1955 book Protestant, Catholic, Jew: An Essay in American Religious Sociology created a sociological framework for the study of religion in the United States. Herberg demonstrated how immigration and American ethnic culture were reflected in religious movements and institutions. It has been described as \\"one of the most influential books ever written about American religion.\\" During the 1950s, that book and the 1951 essay Judaism and Modern Man set out influential positions on Judaism and on the American religious tradition in general. Herberg also wrote that anti-Catholicism is the antisemitism of secular Jewish intellectuals.The Myth of Hitler's Pope =\\"Cut flower culture\\"= Herberg is credited with coining the phrase \\"cut flower culture\\" to describe the spiritual rootlessness of modern European and American societies. The epithet is typically taken to imply that these societies cannot long survive without being regrafted onto their Judeo- Christian roots. In Judaism and Modern Man, Herberg wrote: :The attempt made in recent decades by secularist thinkers to disengage the moral principles of western civilization from their scripturally based religious context, in the assurance that they could live a life of their own as \\"humanistic\\" ethics, has resulted in our \\"cut flower culture.\\" Cut flowers retain their original beauty and fragrance, but only so long as they retain the vitality that they have drawn from their now-severed roots; after that is exhausted, they wither and die. So with freedom, brotherhood, justice, and personal dignity — the values that form the moral foundation of our civilization. Without the life-giving power of the faith out of which they have sprung, they possess neither meaning nor vitality. = Opposition to Civil Rights Movement = In his September 7, 1965 National Review article, \\"'Civil Rights' and Violence: Who Are the Guilty Ones?\\", Herberg wrote of his opposition or skepticism towards the Civil Rights Movement, feeling, like many of his colleagues at National Review at the time, that the civil rights campaign was moving too quickly and broke up the fabric of American society in an overly socially disruptive manner, not friendly to proper social cohesion. They supported what is often termed the Booker T. Washington position of \\"gradual reform.\\" =Final years, death, and legacy= Herberg's final published work saw print in the middle of 1973.Ausmus, Will Herberg, pg. 210. From that time his health deteriorated steadily, culminating with the discovery of an inoperable brain tumor.Ausmus, Will Herberg, pg. 211. Herberg died on March 26, 1977; he was 75 years old at the time of his death. Herberg's memorial service was held in the Great Hall of Drew University in Madison, New Jersey, and was attended by a throng of rabbis, professors, and former students and political associates. Herberg was buried in Morris Plains, New Jersey, next to the grave of his previously departed wife, Anna. Herberg is remembered as a prominent traditionalist conservative and contributor to traditionalist publications such as Russell Kirk's Modern Age and to William F. Buckley, Jr.'s leading conservative magazine National Review, which published a special issue in August 1977 in Herberg's honor.  Footnotes   Works  * American Revolutionary Traditions.

Early life  Ivar was born in Aloja in the Governorate of Livonia (modern Latvia), to parents he described as \\"land-owning farmers\\" and \\"highly intellectual.\\". His father played an active part in the 1905 revolution, and was elected Chairman of the Revolutionary Administrative Committee for his district. In 1906, Tenis Smilga was caught and killed by a punitive expedition sent to crush the revolt in Livonia.  Revolutionary career  Smilga joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party as a 14 year schoolboy, in January 1907, and was arrested for the first time during a May Day demonstration that year. In 1910, he was again arrested for taking part in a student demonstration in Moscow to mark the death of Leo Tolstoy, calling for the abolition of the death penalty, but was released after one month in prison. He was rearrested in July 1911, as a member of the illegal RSDLP organisation in the Lefortovo District, held in custody for three months, then deported to Vologda for three years. He returned in 1914, after the outbreak of war, and joined the Petrograd Bolshevik party committee. Rearrested in May 1915, he was sentenced to three years deportation in Yeniseysk. = Role in 1917 = Freed as a result of the February Revolution, Smilga returned to Petrograd, and became a leading figure in the Bolshevik organisation in the Kronstadt naval base. In May, he was Kronstadt's delegate to the Seventh Conference of the Bolshevik faction of the RSDLP, at which, despite his being only 24 years old, former fellow Siberian exiles put him forward as a member of the nine-member Central Committee. During 1917, he was Vladimir Lenin's most consistent ally and supporter in calling for a second revolution led by the Bolsheviks. In June, Lenin and Smilga submitted their resignations from the Central Committee after the majority agreed to call off an anti-government demonstration due to be held on 10 June, but both resignations were rejected. Smilga had wanted the demonstration to escalate into a revolutionary crisis in which power would be seized by the First Congress of Soviets, then in sessions, and urged that they should not \\"hesitate to seize the Post Office, telegraph and arsenal, if events developed\\" \\\\- but the Congress, which was dominated by supporters of the Kerensky government, insisted on the demonstration being called off. During the Sixth Congress of the Bolshevik party, in August 1917, Smilga declared that the soviets had \\"committed suicide\\" by not opposing the government, and that the party should be ready to seize power alone. \\"No-one has the right to deprive us of this initiative if fate gives us another chance,\\" he declared. Responding to a fellow Bolshevik who had urged caution, he said: \\"Let me remind him of Danton's words: 'In revolution, one needs boldness, boldness, and more boldness!\\" In September, Smilga led the Bolshevik delegation at the Third Regional Congress of Soviets in Helsingfors (Helsinki)- the capital of Finland, which was then under Russian rule - and was elected Chairman of the Regional Committee of the Soviets, a position carrying real power because of the collapse of the government authority in the wake of the Kornilov affair. Lenin was then hiding in Helsingfors, and \\"entered into a sort of conspiracy with Smilga\\", sending a long and angry letter on 27 September complaining that their fellow Bolsheviks were \\"passing resolutions\\" instead of \\"preparing their armed forces for the overthrow of Kerensky.\\" In mid-October, Smilga returned to Petrograd for the Congress of Northern Region Soviets, and stayed to help plan the Bolsheviks seizure of power. Just before the October revolution, he was sent back to Finland with orders to send 1500 armed sailors to Petrograd to act as reserves in case any troops from the front came to attack the city.  Political career  Smilga returned to Petrograd in January 1918, after the Bolsheviks had been routed in the brief civil war that led to the creation of an independent Finland, and served as a member of the praesidium of the Petrograd soviet and an editor of the Bolshevik newspaper Petrogradskaya Pravda. He consistently backed Lenin's line over whether to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which ended the war with Germany. He was transferred to political work in the Red Army at the start of the Russian Civil War, and acted as a political commissar on every major front. He was chief political commissar on the southern front, for the campaign against the army of General Denikin. In January 1921, he was appointed political commissar on the Causasus front, and head of the Caucasian Labour Army. = Relations with Trotsky = During the early part of 1919, Smilga was involved in a conflict over conduct of the civil war, which saw him aligned with Iosif Stalin against Leon Trotsky the People's Commissar for War and future leader of the Left Opposition. Smilga, Mikhail Lashevich and Sergei Gusev were political commissars on the Eastern Front, fighting the army of Admiral Kolchak. The military commander was Sergei Kamenev, a former Colonel in the Imperial Army. The Red Army commander in chief Ioakhim Vatzetis wanted them to halt operations once they had driven Kolchak's army east of the Urals, rather than risk pursuing him into Siberia. Trotsky supported him. Smilga, Lashevich and Kamenev insisted on continuing the offensive, which was a spectacular success. In May, Smilga was appointed head of the Political Directorate of the Red Army. With Stalin's support, he proposed that Kamenev should replace Vatzetis as commander in chief, against Trotsky's advice. After Lenin had overruled Trotsky, in July 1919, Smilga, Gusev and Kamenev joined Trotsky on the six-member Revolutionary Council of War. = Relations with Stalin = Smilga among the Communists on the Fifth All-Russian Congress of Soviets Jul 06 1918 During the war between Russia and Poland, in 1920, Smilga headed the Revolutionary Military Council of the Western Front, whose military commander was Mikhail Tukhachevsky. When the Red Army met unexpectedly strong resistance as it reached the outskirts of Warsaw, Tukhachevsky ordered the Southwestern front to turn northwards, but Stalin, who was the front's political commissar, refused, preferring to capture Lwow. At the Tenth party congress in March 1921, there was a secret session on why Russia lost the war, at which - according to Trotsky - \\"Stalin came out with the declaration, equally startling in its viciousness and untruthfulness, that Smilga...had 'deceived the Central Committee' by 'promising' to take Warsaw by a definite date...I protested on the spot against this startling insinuation: Smilga's 'promise' meant merely that he had hoped to take Warsaw.\\" = Post-war career = Smilga was dropped from the Central Committee in March 1921. Soon afterwards, he was appointed head of the Main Directorate for Fuel. He was also vice-chairman of the Vesenkha from 1921 to 1928, and of the Gosplan from 1924 to 1926. From 1925, he was a prominent supporter of the Left Opposition, one of only half a dozen oppositionists elected a full member of the Central Committee in December 1925 - despite the fact that in August 1925, Stalin complained about Smilga's influence in Gosplan and denounced him as a \\"fake economic leader.\\" He was dismissed in June 1927 and transferred to Khabarovsk, in Siberia. His departure was the occasion for the last public demonstration against the Stalin regime, in which about a thousand people gathered at the railway to show solidarity. Smilga was expelled from the Central Committee on 14 November 1927, expelled from the communist party in December, and deported to a remote area of Siberia. In July 1929, along with Yevgeni Preobrazhensky, Karl Radek, he renounced his support for the Left Opposition, citing the reason that Joseph Stalin's rise would have meant the application of much of the Left's recommended policies, and that the dangers the Soviet state faced, from the outside as well as from within, required their \\"return to the Party\\". About 400 other deportees followed their lead. His membership of the communist party was restored in 1930, and he was allowed to return to economic work. Trotskyist historian Pierre Broué suspected he was a member of the secret opposition bloc Trotsky, Zinoviev and Kamenev had created in 1932. = Arrest and execution = Smilga was arrested on the night of 1–2 January 1935, in the wake of Kirov's assassination, and sentenced to five years imprisonment. He was held for months in an isolator in Verkhneuralsk. At the first of three Moscow show trials, in August 1936, the lead defendant Grigory Zinoviev named Smilga as having been implicated in the 'Trotskyite-Zinovievite Terrorist Centre'. It later emerged in Trotsky's letters that Zinoviev and trotskyists had indeed formed a secret alliance, but there was no evidence of terrorist activity in them. Unlike almost all the other eminent Old Bolsheviks named during the proceedings, he was never subjected to a public trial, suggesting that the NKVD had not been able to break his spirit sufficiently to be able to rely on him to confess. He was shot in February 1938.  Personality  A scientist working in Russia in the 1920s, who had no reason to speak well of Smilga, and in face held him responsible for the execution of a group of technicians from the former Nobel company during the civil war, nevertheless believed that he should have been appointed head of Vesenkha. \\"He seemed to me quite superior to all other members of the Praesidium...He was well educated, with vigorous and pleasant features, and authoritative in speech and action...he impressed me favourably by his frankness and the fearless way he expressed his convictions, even when they were quite the opposite of those of his party colleagues.\\" Viktor Serge, a fellow supporter of the left opposition, described Smilga as \\"a fair-haired intellectual with spectacles, a chin-beard, and thinning front, ordinary to look at and distinctly the armchair sort.\\" Smilga was posthumously rehabilitated in 1987.

The etymology of the generic name refers to its status as an early ceratopsian and also to Dawn Dodson, wife of Peter Dodson, one of the palaeontologists who described it. Discovery and species The first specimen was found in the Xinminpu Group, Gongpoquan Basin of the Mazong Shan area of Gansu Province, north central China. As of 2020, fossils from more than 80 more individuals have been found, including complete skeletons. The specific descriptor, \\"rugosus\\", Latin for \\"rough\\", refers to the various rugose areas on the surface of both skull and jaw, namely the wrinkled expansion of the lacrimal bone distinctive of this animal. Auroraceratops is the second basal neoceratopsian to be found in the Mazong Shan area, after Archaeoceratops. The type specimen, IG-2004-VD-001, consists of a nearly complete subadult skull lacking the rostral bone and parietal crest. Description Though most other neoceratopsians are characterized by a long, narrow snout, Auroraceratops has a shorter wider one. The skull itself is rather flat and wide. The premaxillae have at least two pairs of striated fang-like teeth. Paired rugose areas, very probably covered in keratin in life, are in front of the eyes and on the jugal with corresponding areas on the lower jaw. These roughened knobs were likely to have been used for inter- and intra-specific interactions. While they would not have been much use as a physical defense against predators, another possible function for these structures would be in pushing or butting contests between members of the same species either for mating rights or social disputes. Auroraceratops is a rather derived moderate-sized basal neoceratopsian that adds diversity to that clade, displaying skull features not present in Archaeoceratops or Liaoceratops. A detailed analysis of the post-cranial skeleton published in 2019 showed that the animal would have walked bipedally and had an estimated body weight of .

The key difference between ReviewCentre and its competitors is the lack of financial incentive to the writers of the reviews - this means that there is no other motive to write a review than to help other consumers which may explain why reviews on Review Centre are more personal. One should be wary of this fact as reviews can often appear as a personal attack on businesses and may give a distorted view - many people will only leave a review when something is wrong.

One area of the site where ReviewCentre does stay ahead of its competitors is 'community' - also, enjoying a strong user base and member interaction is currently growing. Pollach's study suggests that the nature of the genre could be the reasoning for this as users strive to appear professional in their reviews, almost actively discouraging discussion. The differences in the presentation of reviews on Review Centre and the structure of that information in comparison to its competitors have been diminishing and may explain why Review Centre operates as much of a community site than Ciao or Epinions. However the downside is that the staff at Review Centre do not appear to take negative reviews or their potential effects on businesses very seriously which leaves the system open to abuse.

There is also a disjunct population on the Atlantic coasts of Namibia and South Africa. Description Spartina maritima is a coarse, robust, herbaceous perennial plant growing gregariously from a creeping rootstock. The plant is tall, green in spring and summer, and turning light brown in autumn and winter. The leaves are slender, long, and broad at the base, tapering to a blunt point. The inflorescence is a group of two or three unbranched spikes up to long, each with several unstalked, one-flowered, downy spikelets about long, which are produced on all sides of the stalk and closely pressed against it. The pointed stem tip does not overtop the highest spikelet. The flowers are greenish, turning yellowish-brown by the winter. Distribution and habitat Spartina maritima is native to the west-facing coasts of Europe and North Africa. It occupies a range of habitats including very soft mud and shingle, in minimally exposed areas, away from strong wave action. It occurs on the seaward margins of saltmarshes and creeks and may be plentiful in dried up pools in the upper parts of saltmarshes. In the British Isles, it occurs in estuaries in Essex and in the Solent. Hybridisation and decline When the related American species Spartina alterniflora (smooth cordgrass) was introduced to southern England in about 1870, it hybridised with S. maritima to give the hybrid Spartina × townsendii. This then gave rise to a new allotetraploid species Spartina anglica (common cordgrass), which is much more vigorous, and has now largely ousted S. maritima from much of its native range in Western Europe.

The term has been adopted by Scouting organizations to reflect skills and knowledge which are felt to be a core part of the various programs, alongside community and spirituality. Skills commonly included are camping, cooking, first aid, wilderness survival, orienteering and pioneering. Origins For Europeans, Scoutcraft grew out of the woodcraft skills necessary to survive in the expanding frontiers of the New World in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Frontiersmen such as Daniel Boone needed these skills to travel through the uncharted wildernesses and difficult terrains. But Scoutcraft was practiced by the Native Americans long before the arrival of the colonists and it was from Native American scouts that the art of Scoutcraft, or Woodcraft as it was more commonly known in the American Old West, passed to the early European pioneers. As the nineteenth century moved on, Scoutcraft began to be adopted by parts of some military forces, as the way in which wars and battles were fought changed. The American scout Frederick Russell Burnham brought Scoutcraft to Africa and, in the Second Matabele War, he introduced it to Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scouting movement. Baden-Powell first began forming his idea for a programme of training young men in Scoutcraft whilst scouting with Burnham in Matobo Hills, Matabeleland (now part of Zimbabwe). Later, Baden-Powell wrote a number of books on the subject, and even started to train and make use of adolescent boys, most famously during the Siege of Mafeking, during the Second Boer War. Scouting After the Second Boer War, Baden-Powell enjoyed a celebrity status for his command at Mafeking. He set about writing a new book, Scouting for Boys, which was published in 1908. This was removed from his earlier, more martial works, but kept the idea of Scoutcraft as a core part of the Scouting program. Some critics accused Baden-Powell of trying to create a pseudo- military organisation, but he was quick to distance himself and Scouting from his earlier military experiences, and instead pointed out the importance of self-reliance, duty and thoughtfulness which his new program promoted. In order to test that a new member had earned the title of Scout, Baden-Powell devised a number of tests for them to complete, including knot-tying, animal tracking, first aid, navigation, and fire-lighting. Other tests listed by Baden-Powell include having sixpence in a bank, and knowing about the Union Flag and its significance — these latter tests are generally not included in Scoutcraft in more recent times. Similar books were published in America by Ernest Thompson Seton, a pioneer of the Scouting movement in the United States. Scoutcraft is still a core part of many organisations' programs. The Scout Association of the United Kingdom lists the following benefits of Scoutcraft: * encourages self-reliance, resourcefulness and confidence in their own ability * develops skills to be used in the outdoors * provides training for what to do in emergency situations Skills An example list of Scoutcraft skills, taken from 1964's Boy Scout Handbook (sixth edition) includes: * Camp Cooking * Camp Health * Camp Preparation * Cleanup * Edible Wild Plants * Finding Directions * Fire Building * First aid * Hiking * Knowing Trees and Shrubs * Lashings * Map Reading * Map Sketching * Preparing Firewood * Selecting [a] Campsite * Signaling * Swimming * Tent Pitching * Use of [a] Compass * Using [an] Axe in Camp * Wildlife See also *Batoning References Category:Scouting ","title":"Scoutcraft"},{"id":"3417699","text":"The East India Squadron, or East Indies Squadron, was a squadron of American ships which existed in the nineteenth century, it focused on protecting American interests in the Far East while the Pacific Squadron concentrated on the western coasts of the Americas and in the South Pacific Ocean. Part of the duties of this squadron was serving with the Yangtze River Patrol in China. The East India Squadron was established in 1835 and existed until it became part of the Asiatic Squadron in 1868. History Wilkes Expedition in 1838. Shortly before Senator Levi Woodbury of New Hampshire became secretary of the Navy in 1831, Edmund Roberts had sent him a letter detailing the neglected state of Far Eastern commerce and whaling. Near the end of that year, American pepper trader Friendship returned to her home port of Salem, to report that Sumatran pirates had killed the first officer and two crewmen, and plundered the cargo. In response to public outcry, President Andrew Jackson dispatched the Potomac on the first of what were to be two punitive expeditions to Sumatra. The sloop-of-war Peacock was also dispatched, and, on the recommendation of Woodbury, carried Roberts as envoy to Cochin-China, Siam and Muscat, to negotiate treaties to place American commerce on a surer basis, and on an equality with that of the most favored nations. Roberts succeeded with Siam and Muscat. Peacock returned in 1835–37 with Dr. W. S. W. Ruschenberger bearing ratifications of those treaties. Peacock, which in 1828 had been broken down and rebuilt as an exploration vessel, joined the United States Exploring Expedition in 1838. East India Squadron Columbia and John Adams had also joined the circumnavigating Expedition, and, without having to detour, executed the Second Sumatran Expedition. =Formation= Except for whaling and pepper, U.S. trade with the Far East was limited, but for those who risked long voyage to trade fur, sandalwood, and cotton goods for Chinese silks and tea, the results were very profitable. Indeed, stories about the riches of Far East created the national myth about the vast potential of the China market. In an effort to turn the myth into reality, the US sent envoy Roberts to Cochin-China in 1835 aboard the Peacock, escorted by the schooner Enterprise under the command of Commodore Edmund P. Kennedy. They called first at the port of Canton, and Roberts' account gives a vivid description of the state of affairs there. Kennedy subsequently established the East India Squadron.The Naval Institute historical atlas of the U.S. Navy By Craig L. Symonds, William J. Clipson, PG 64. =First Opium War= Some Americans in China suffered during the first Opium War of 1839 as Chinese, indignant about British opium traders, failed to distinguish between English-speaking people of European ancestry. Commodore Kearny was given command of a squadron consisting of the 42-year-old frigate Constellation and the sloop Boston. Kearny arrived in China in March 1842 and the Opium War soon ended. Kearny first learned of the Treaty of Nanking when he arrived in Hong Kong. Kearny observed the treaty's provisions opening five Chinese ports to British trade, and sought equal trading opportunity for Americans. The Viceroy of Guangzhou offered Kearny a treaty giving Americans fair treatment. Kearny did not have authority to sign such a treaty, but tactfully informed Ke agreement would be forthcoming as soon as authorized negotiators arrived. Caleb Cushing reached China in 1844, and the Treaty of Wanghia was signed on 2 July.Hanks, Robert J., CAPT USN \\"Commodore Lawrence Kearny, the Diplomatic Seaman\\" United States Naval Institute Proceedings November 1970 pp.70–72 =Opening of Japan= In December 1845, Commodore James Biddle exchanged ratifications of the Treaty of WanghiaSewall, John S. (1905). The Logbook of the Captain's Clerk: Adventures in the China Seas, p. xxxi. at Poon Tong (泮塘), a village outside Guangzhou. The treaty was the first treaty between China and the United States. On July 20, 1846, he anchored with the two warships USS Columbus and USS Vincennes in Uraga Channel at the mouth to Edo Bay in an attempt to open up Japan to trade with the United States, but was ultimately unsuccessful. Biddle delivered his request that Japan agree to a similar treaty to that which he had just negotiated with China. Biddle eventually received the shogunate's response and was told that Japan forbade all commerce and communication with foreign nations besides that of the Dutch; also, he was informed that all foreign affairs were conducted through Nagasaki and that his ships should leave Uraga immediately.Sewall, pp. xxxiv–xxxv, xlix, lvi. In 1852, Commodore Matthew C. Perry embarked from Norfolk, Virginia for Japan, in command of a squadron in search of a Japanese trade treaty. Aboard a black-hulled steam frigate, he ported Mississippi, Plymouth, Saratoga, and USS Susquehanna at Uraga Harbor near Edo (modern Tokyo) on July 8, 1853. His actions at this crucial juncture were informed by a careful study of Japan's previous contacts with Western ships and what could be known about the Japanese hierarchical culture. He was met by representatives of the Tokugawa Shogunate who told him to proceed to Nagasaki, where there was limited trade with the Netherlands and which was the only Japanese port open to foreigners at that time (see Sakoku). Perry returned in February 1854 with twice as many ships, finding that the delegates had prepared a treaty embodying virtually all the demands in Fillmore's letter. Perry signed the Convention of Kanagawa on March 31, 1854 and departed, mistakenly believing the agreement had been made with imperial representatives.Sewall, pp. 243–264. The agreement was made with the Shogun, the de facto ruler of Japan. =Johanna Expedition= The Johanna Expedition was a naval operation that occurred in August 1851 during the American anti- slavery patrols in the Indian Ocean. It began in response the seizure of the merchant ship Maria and her captain, a man named Moores, in the small Sultanate of Johanna. The United States Navy sent the sloop-of-war USS Dale, under Captain William Pearson, to free Moores and to demand compensation for the incident. When the sultan refused, the Americans briefly bombarded a fort and blockhouse protecting the harbor of Matsamudu.http://www.history.navy.mil/special%20highlights/pirates/Suppression%20of%20Piracy%20on%20Johanna%20Island,%20August%201851,%20Amerman,%20USMC%20HD.pdf =Anti-piracy operations= USS Powhatan In July 1855, Chinese pirates in the Hong Kong area captured four merchant ships, apparently of British subject. In response, on 4 August 1855, armed boats from the East India Squadron frigate USS Powhatan and the Royal Navy sloop-of-war HMS Rattler attacked the pirates at the Battle of Ty-ho Bay. HMS Eaglet towed the boats into position which then proceeded to destroy twenty of thirty-six junks. Seven merchant ships were also rescued. An estimated 500 pirates were killed or wounded and over 1,000 taken prisoner compared to an allied loss of nine dead and about a dozen wounded. =Second Opium War= The United States would see action again during the Second Opium War from 1856 to 1860. Four of the squadron's ships were involved in at least two battles. At the beginning of the war, the United States Navy frigate, USS San Jacinto and two sloops-of-war, USS Portsmouth and USS Levant, launched an attack against a series of Chinese forts along Pearl River. The engagement became known as the Battle of the Pearl River Forts and was fought in 1856. The second involvement of an East India Squadron ship was during the Second Battle of Taku Forts in 1859. The American warship, USS Powhatan, assisted an Anglo and French attack by bombarding the Taku Forts. No further engagements between Chinese and American forces during the war are known to have happened though American citizens living in Canton fought as militia at the 1856 battle at Canton. USS Portsmouth =Bombardment of Qui Nhon= On June 30, 1861, USS Saginaw, under James F. Schenck, silenced a fort at the entrance to Qui Nhon Bay, Cochinchina. This was after a Vietnamese artillery battery had fired upon her while she was searching for the missing boat and crew of an American merchant bark named Myrtle. After an engagement lasting just under an hour, the Chinese fort was destroyed and a large explosion was observed by the Americans. It became the only battle of the Cochinchina Campaign involving the United States which deployed the East India Squadron to protect American interests in the region. =Formosan Expedition= Following the Rover Incident of March 1867 in which the American bark Rover was wrecked and massacred by the Paiwan people of southern Formosa; the East India Squadron under Rear Admiral Henry H. Bell launched a punitive expedition in retaliation. On June 18, 1867, 181 officers, sailors and marines from two screw sloops-of-war landed with the intention of destroying the hostile threat. After six hours of marching through the hot tropical Formosan mountains and after several skirmishes, the Americans turned back to their ships. The expedition failed after the death of an American commander and the loss of several men due to the humid climate. They boarded USS Wyoming and USS Hartford and then set sail for Shanghai. A year later the squadron was merged into the new Asiatic Squadron. Ships USS Powhatan, under Commander William J. McCluney, was assigned to the East India Squadron and arrived on station via Cape of Good Hope 15 June 1853. Her arrival in Chinese waters coincided with an important phase of Commodore Matthew C. Perry’s negotiations for commercial relations with the Japanese and the opening of two ports. She was Perry’s flagship during his November visit to Whampoa. On 14 February 1854 she entered Yedo Bay with the rest of the squadron and the Treaty of Kanagawa was signed on her deck on 31 March 1854. Assigned to the East India Squadron under Commodore Matthew Perry, the USS Macedonian with Capt. Joel Abbot in command, was one of the six American ships arrayed off Uraga, Japan, 13 February 1854 during Perry's second visit to negotiate the opening of Japan to foreign trade. After completing her trials, which she began in January 1851, the side- wheel steamer USS Susquehanna sailed on 8 June for the Far East to become flagship of the East India Squadron. The USS Dolphin got underway 6 May 1848 to join the East India Squadron, protecting American citizens in Asiatic waters. Recommissioned on 12 August 1850, USS Saratoga got underway on 15 September and proceeded to the western Pacific for service in the East India Squadron. USS Levant sailed 13 November for Rio de Janeiro, the Cape of Good Hope, and Hong Kong, where she arrived to join the East India Squadron 12 May 1856. On 1 July she embarked the U.S. Commissioner to China for transportation to Shanghai, arriving 1 August. Departing Norfolk 4 August, the USS Germantown sailed via the Cape of Good Hope to Ceylon, where on 22 December she joined Flag Officer Josiah Tattnall's East India Squadron off Point de Gala. For 2 years she cruised Far Eastern waters and visited the principal ports of China and Japan, where she found \\"uniform friendly reception\\" as the squadron guarded American interests in the Orient. Sailing via the Cape of Good Hope, she returned to Norfolk in April 1860 After a four-day stop at Singapore, where Commodore Armstrong relieved Commodore Joel Abbot in command of the East India Squadron, the frigate USS San Jacinto reached the bar off the mouth of the Me Nam (later the Chao Phraya) River. The new side-wheel steamer USS Saginaw sailed from San Francisco Bay on 8 March 1860, headed for the western Pacific, and reached Shanghai, China, on 12 May. She then served in the East India Squadron, for the most part cruising along the Chinese coast to protect American citizens and to suppress pirates. She visited Japan in November but soon returned to Chinese waters. On 30 June 1861, she silenced a battery at the entrance to Qui Nhon Bay, Cochin China, which had fired upon her while she was searching for the missing boat and crew of American bark, Myrtle. On 3 January 1862, Saginaw was decommissioned at Hong Kong. On 3 July 1862, she returned to Mare Island for repairs.

Later, he was employed at the University of Michigan and Columbia University. Professor Cole became secretary of the American Mathematical Society in 1895 and an editor of its Bulletin in 1897. Cole published a number of important papers, including The Diurnal Variation of Barometric Pressure (1892). In 1893 in Chicago, his paper On a Certain Simple Group (the group is PSL(2,8)) was read (but not by him) at the International Mathematical Congress held in connection with the World's Columbian Exposition. On October 31, 1903, Cole famously made a presentation to a meeting of the American Mathematical Society where he identified the factors of the Mersenne number 267 − 1, or M67. Édouard Lucas had demonstrated in 1876 that M67 must have factors (i.e., is not prime), but he was unable to determine what those factors were. During Cole's so-called \\"lecture\\", he approached the chalkboard and in complete silence proceeded to calculate the value of M67, with the result being 147,573,952,589,676,412,927. Cole then moved to the other side of the board and wrote 193,707,721 × 761,838,257,287, and worked through the tedious calculations by hand. Upon completing the multiplication and demonstrating that the result equaled M67, Cole returned to his seat, not having uttered a word during the hour-long presentation. His audience greeted the presentation with a standing ovation. Cole later admitted that finding the factors had taken \\"three years of Sundays.\\" Cole died alone in New York City, aged 64. The American Mathematical Society's Cole Prize was named in his honor.

He was an advocate for Christian pacifism and a conscientious objector.  Biography  A native of Ohio, born in 1893, West was a member of the Church of the Brethren and graduated from Manchester University (Indiana) in 1917. As a church man from Indiana, West spent two years as a conscientious objector during World War I. After working for the Emergency Peace Campaign in 1936, he traveled to Spain to serve as the director of a relief program in the Spanish Civil War. He grew weary of handing out rationed supplies and thought there had to be a better way of eliminating hunger. He gave the idea to his neighbors and many congregations in northern Indiana of donating young heifers to families in need. The involvement from his community led him to bigger dreams. His idea became an official program of the Church of the Brethren in 1942 and eventually became an independent nonprofit corporation in 1953. His phrase \\"not a cup of milk, but a cow\\" became the mantra for Heifer International, which continues on today. Upon returning to the United States, West pushed for two more programs to be created. Alongside Alma Long, he was a key person in helping to develop the Brethren Volunteer Service (BVS) in 1948. The BVS acted as an alternative to military service for war objectors beginning in World War II. At Manchester University, West spoke to the president of the University and, together, they convinced Gladdys Muir to launch the nation's first undergraduate program in peace studies at Manchester University.

The village is located in the local government area of the City of Lithgow. It is located 250 km north-west of Sydney and approximately 80 kilometres north of Lithgow.Robinson's Road Atlas of Australia, Edition 8 (Lansdowne Press) 1983, Map 204 In the , Glen Davis had a population of 354 but this fell to 115 in the 2016 census. Location Glen Davis is situated in the Capertee Valley, from which the Capertee River flows. Glen Davis is located north of Lithgow, New South Wales, off the road to Mudgee. It lies just to the east of the Great Dividing Range, as the Capertee River is part of the Hawkesbury-Nepean river system. The nearest other town is Capertee, which formerly had the closest connection to Glen Davis by rail. Its location was due originally to the presence of deposits of oil shale and coal nearby. Disadvantages of Glen Davis's location were its relative remoteness, its relatively low rainfall, and, paradoxically, that the lower part of its site is subject to flooding during heavy rains. History = Before Glen Davis = The Wiradjuri people are the original inhabitants of the Capertee Valley and the location now known as Glen Davis. The valley is in the north-eastern corner of the traditional lands of the Wiradjiri, near the boundary with the Darkinyung lands. European settlers took over land in the valley, beginning in the 1820s, and progressively cleared the land on the valley floor for grazing and agriculture. During the early 20th-Century, a small settlement known as North Newnes existed in the Capertee Valley close to the portal of a tunnel that was being driven to connect the valley with the oil shale operations in the Wolgan Valley at Newnes (then also known as South Newnes). The two settlements were connected by a bridle track between the two valleys. The tunnel, known as 'Lang's Tunnel', lay west of the later oil shale mine and had a length of , by the time that work on it was abandoned in September 1906. The miners had left the site by November 1908. The site of North Newnes was probably near the adit of the later oil shale mine, east of the site of the later Glen Davis township. = Shale oil town (1938–1952) = From 1938, the area adjacent to the site of Glen Davis became the centre of a revival of the oil shale industry. The town was established under an Act of the N.S.W. Parliament in December 1939. It was named after George Francis Davis. Glen Davis was notable because it was the first time that there had been an attempt in N.S.W. to create a completely new town based on town planning principles. Construction of the Glen Davis Oil Shale Works began in 1938, before the town existed, and the earliest workers had to live in tents or otherwise make their own housing. This shanty housing often made use of white-washed hessian bagging and other inexpensive materials that were to hand, and the area became known at the 'Bag Town'. It was not within the neat planned township but on the opposite side of the Capertee River, on river flats prone to flooding. The settlement known as 'Glen Davis' thus came to consist of the planned town of Glen Davis, on the southern side of the river, the 'Bag Town' on the northern side, and a little to the east—between the town centre and the works, on land owned by National Oil Proprietary Limited—an area of staff and employee housing. There was also a planned industrial area to the north-west of the town centre. The Glen Davis Oil Shale Works first made shale oil in January 1940. The post office for the town opened on 1 March 1939. The school opened in January 1940. Land sales in the town occurred in March 1940 but none of the residential sites were sold at the time. Conditions of sale for residential blocks were relaxed later in 1940. Houses later built there were financed and constructed under a cooperative building scheme, under which no deposit was required but equity was allocated based on the value of rental payments made. In 1947, Glen Davis had a population of approximately 1,600, who were accommodated as follows: 11 substantial brick houses for staff; a staff hostel made of brick accommodating 30 junior staff; 100 permanent and 50 'war-type' individually-owned residences; a group of barracks with accommodation and boarding for 300 single men; a commercial hotel with 25 rooms; and a 'Bag Town' of 250 mostly sub-standard dwellings. The school had 260 pupils and 7 teachers. There was a post office, a bank and a police station. The town had a doctor, a pharmacist, three churches, a community centre, golf course, bowling green, children's playground and tennis courts. There were few commercial outlets; two general stores; a pharmacy; a garage; a 'saloon' (a bar separate from the hotel); a barber shop; and the hotel. There was also a motion-picture theatre in the 'Bag Town' section. Driven by government policy and a shortage of labour for the shale oil operations, post-war migrants settled in the town from around 1948, facing hostility from some workers and residents. At its peak, the population reached approximately 2000. There was an ambulance station, with two ambulances, that had been funded by the people of the town. There was also a bakery. From 1949, the town had a reticulated water supply. The water was piped over 105 km from the Oberon Dam on the Fish River, a rare instance of water from the Murray-Darling catchment being supplied to a location that is east of the Great Dividing Range. = Decline = The works and the associated shale and coal mines were closed and abandoned, in May 1952, because the works was unprofitable and accumulated losses were approaching the value of the capital and advances involved. By late 1952, there were 50 vacant houses in the town. Home owners received some compensation from the Commonwealth Government. Equipment in the plant was auctioned off in early 1953, by which time the ambulance station had closed, the town was taking on a forlorn unkempt appearance, and the population had fallen to 460. There was some work available in dismantling parts of the shale oil works during 1953. By mid-1954, the population had fallen to 320, there were 80 empty houses, only three shops were left open— general merchant, butcher and newsagent— and the town had lost its doctor, police station and clergymen. What was left uninhabited was subject to damage by vandals and thieves from outside the town The population had dwindled to 195, by late 1954. The skeleton of a town survived in the form of some properties, a hotel, a post office, and a shop or two that operated intermittently. Many houses and other building in the town were either relocated or demolished; some others just decayed away over time. The school closed in February 1962. The post office closed on 1 October 1986. = Present = The creation of the Wollemi National Park brought a degree of tourism to the area and the ruins of the oil shale works are now also a minor tourist attraction. Some buildings associated with the old town are now used for tourist accommodation, including the hotel, in the old township, and the former Inspector's and General Manager's cottages, at the locality known as 'the Poplars' that lies between the modern- day village and the ruins of the works. The parkland reserve, at the centre of the old town plan, is now the Glen Davis Campground. A lasting legacy of the shale oil era is that the village still receives its freshwater supply via the concrete pipeline from the Oberon Dam. National Parks The Wollemi National Park takes in 492,976 hectares and is the second-largest national park in New South Wales. It includes some parts of the Capertee Valley, especially downstream of Glen Davis.Guide to New South Wales National Parks, NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, 2002, p.37 The National Parks and Wildlife Service marked out a track between Glen Davis and Newnes, in the Wolgan Valley, and this became a popular walk known as the Pipeline Pass.Sydney and Blue Mountains Bushwalks, Neil Paton (Kangaroo Press) 2004, p.308 Bushwalkers also use Glen Davis as the starting point for camping trips in the national park; there is also a camp site in the town. Nearby are two smaller parks, the Mugii Murum-ban State Conservation Area — an area of particular significance to Wiradjuri people — and the Capertee National Park. Another national park was created later, known as the Gardens of Stone National Park. This takes in some areas around the Capertee Valley, including the flat-topped mountain—or butte—called Pantony's Crown. This mountain was named after an early farmer who opened the area up to sheep farming.Guide to New South Wales National Parks, NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, 2002, p.31 The National Trail, a long-distance walking trail that goes from Melbourne to Cooktown, also passes through the Capertee Valley.  Culture  The town was the subject of a documentary film, No Such Place, which was the first film made by the Australian director Peter Butt, in 1981. The Glen Davis Shale Oil Works and a property now resumed into the National Park downstream from these sites was the location (Paradise Valley) for the 1980 Australian movie The Chain Reaction. The movie starred Mel Gibson (uncredited) and Steve Bisley, Cinematography by Russel Boyd, and had George Miller as First Assistant Director. Many locals appeared in the movie as extras.

Mossoró was also the first city to give women the right to vote in Brazil (Professor Celina Guimarães Viana cast the first vote in 1928), sparking a movement among other cities and states in Brazil that culminated in the official recognition of women's suffrage by the national government in 1934. Population Growth Culture and Recreation Caiçara e Mar - Downtown Although it does not have beaches within its city limits, there are several magnificent beaches in the surrounding area of the Costa Branca Pole such as the desert beaches of the city of Areia Branca. World-famous Canoa Quebrada beach is a short drive away in the neighboring state of Ceará. The Resistance Museum tells the story of the city and the city's native sons. However, the most famous attraction is the Mossoró Cidade Junina (Mossoró Junina City Festival), a winter festival (festa junina) that attracts more than a million people during the month of June. The city has a beautiful historic town, a hub of fascinating stories of the region's development. Main attractions include the Museu Municipal Jornalista Lauro da Escóssia (Journalist Lauro da Escóssia Municipal Museum), also known as the Cangaço Museum, the Station Arts old railway station museum, the Oil Museum, St. Vincent Church, and the Cathedral of Santa Luzia. Other attractions include the famous Palace of Resistance, former residence of mayor Rodolfo Fernandes who was the leader of the resistance against the \\"Lamp band\\" (Lampião) and served as a rampart against attacks from those notorious bandits. There is also the Bode Market, an ovine and caprine trading center where traders and buyers of sheep and goats continue the long-held rural traditions of the northeast, as well as the famous Central Market and the Railway Bridge. In September, the city stages what could be the largest play in the world, the Auto Da Liberdade (The Procession of Liberty) with an all- paid cast of 2,000 and a 600-member chorus as part of its Festa da Liberdade (Brazilian independence celebrations). Mossoró also has a shopping center, Mossoró West Shopping, which includes a 5-screen multiplex cinema, Wi-Fi internet connectivity, children's recreation and diaper changing area, ATMs, bowling alley, pharmacy, and food court among its many amenities. Mossoró is also home to the Hotel Thermas Resort which is the largest thermal water park in Brazil.

The event was disguised as a nonpolitical county fair. It was one of the main public demonstrations in support of German unity, freedom and democracy during the Vormärz era. Background At the time of the 1815 Congress of Vienna, Hambach Castle with the historic Palatinate region on the west bank of the Rhine was part of the Kingdom of Bavaria. It had however been occupied by French Revolutionary troops during the War of the First Coalition in 1794 and incorporated into the French First Republic in 1801. After Napoleon's defeat, the new Bavarian authorities maintained some constitutional rights, but the local population nevertheless suffered from high taxes and increasing censorship. National and liberal ideas were strongly advocated by student fraternities (Burschenschaften), the first Urburschenschaft was founded in Jena, Thuringia in 1815 and adopted the Black-Red-Gold colours of the Lützow Free Corps forces, who had fought against the Napoleonic troops. A corresponding flag was already carried along the procession to the Wartburg Festival in 1817. Suppressed by the 1819 Carlsbad Decrees, the German democratic movement gained new momentum by the French July Revolution of 1830 as well as by the November Uprising in Russian Congress Poland, sparking unrests in Saxony, Hanover, Hesse, Brunswick and even in the Prussian capital Berlin. The insurgents witnessed the implementation of the French constitutional July Monarchy and the Belgian Revolution, but also the suppression of the Polish National Government of Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski by Russian troops. About 10,000 emigrants fled Poland in the so-called Great Emigration to France via the German states; they were well received especially in Saxony, Baden and Bavaria, where several pro-Polish patronage associations (Polenvereine) arose. Festival The formerly French Palatinate had been a last resort for liberal authors and intellectuals, who now had to face the reactionary Bavarian policies. In January 1832 a number of journalists established a democratic association for freedom of the press and speech, which was almost immediately banned by the state government. In turn, the initiators called for a \\"fair\\" at Hambach Castle, as any demonstrations were prohibited. About 20-30,000 people from all ranks of society—workmen, women, students and members of parliament, as well as from France and Poland.

This pro-Polish support expressed in Hambach was the climax of German liberals' enthusiasm for Poland.British Envoys to Germany 1816-1866:, Volume 2 2;Volumes 1830-1847 Markus Mösslang,Sabine Freitag,Peter Wende page 27 Cambridge University Press 2006Historical dictionary of Poland, 966-1945 Jerzy Jan Lerski Greenwood Publishing 1996, page 176Stosunki polsko- niemieckie, 1831-1848: Wiosna Ludów i okres ją poprzedzający : materiały Konferencji Komisji Mieszanej UNESCO PRL-RFN do Spraw Ulepszania Podręczników Szkolnych w PRL i w RFN w zakresie historii i geografii Deidesheim 1978 page 63 A participant who had to emigrate later in the United States and became a public figure there described in his memoirs one highlight of the festival in this manner: The main demands of the meeting were liberty, civil and political rights as well as national unity and popular sovereignty against the European system of the Holy Alliance. No consensus was reached in regard to actions, and a few uncoordinated violent acts were carried out by students later. The poet Ludwig Börne, who followed his invitation by the representatives of the banned press association, described his mixed emotions, when Heidelberg students gathered in a clamorous torchlight procession in his honour, declaring him a national hero. Burschenschaft members demanded an open revolt and the implementation of a provisional government, which was strongly rejected by the journalists. Nevertheless, of the four main organizers of the meeting, three (Philipp Jakob Siebenpfeiffer and the attorneys Schüler and Geib) fled the country, a fourth (Johann G. A. Wirth) chose to stay and was sentenced to two years in prison. Aftermath Rebuilt Hambach Castle today The gathering had no immediate results, but is considered a milestone in German history because it was the first time that a republican movement had made its mark in the country. It was criticized as a missed opportunity, including by Heinrich Heine.See Heine, Ludwig Börne: A Memorial, trans. J.L. Sammons (Camden House, 2006), pp. 69–72. The next year, about 50 insurgents tried to start a democratic revolution by charging the Frankfurt guard house (Frankfurter Wachensturm), which ultimately failed. Instead the Hambach events prompted the legalist German Federal Convention to issue its order of 28 June 1832 which again tightened the Carlsbad Decrees and completely suppressed freedom of speech. On the anniversary date in 1833, Bavarian military controlled the area and dispersed all attempts to hold another gathering. Many intellectuals retired to a non-political Biedermeier life in the following years. The Festival also confirmed the establishment of the combination of black, red and gold as a symbol of a democratic movement for a united Germany. These colours were later used by democratic revolutionaries in the Revolutions of 1848 as a symbol of German unity, which however was not achieved until the unification of 1871 —then to Bismarck's specifications. After World War I, Black-Red-Gold were adopted by the Weimar Republic as the national colours of Germany and are the colors of the modern German flag. Hambach Castle became an icon of the German democratic movement. A possession of Prince Maximilian II of Bavaria from 1842, it was rebuilt in a Gothic Revival style from 1844 and is today the site of a historical exhibition.

She was constructed and used as a training cruiser (\\"Schulschiff\\") in peacetime and planned for multi-role missions in the event of war: troop ship, hospital ship, minelayer, and escort. In order to prepare cadets in the best possible way for their duties in the active fleet, the ship was carrying the type of armament and machinery that was reflecting the equipment fitted to the German Navy ships of that period. Therefore, the machinery was rather diverse (two pairs of different diesel engines and a steam turbine), and performance- wise the emphasis had rather been laid on range than speed. Under deck, comparably large teaching rooms underlined the primary role and, unlike other ships in the fleet, Deutschland had some civilians (captain's steward, shoemaker, tailor) serving alongside military personnel. In her time Deutschland was the largest vessel in the navy of the Federal Republic of Germany. Permission to build the ship was granted despite being larger than allowed by tonnage restrictions imposed by the WEU on West Germany. (The later Berlin class replenishment ships of the reunited Germany are much larger.) Like most German post-war naval ships she was completely NBC protected. Deutschland was the smallest German cruiser since the 4,385-ton and Bremse of 1915. This one-ship class, Type 440 of the German designation system, cost 95 million DM. Service career and fate Ordered in late 1958, the training ship Deutschland was laid down at Nobiskrug shipyard in Rendsburg on 11 September 1959. Launched on 5 November 1960, it was originally intended to name the Federal German Navy's training ship Berlin. For obvious political reasons however (Germany and Berlin being divided and the latter existing under the four power status, and the allies objecting the name chosen), the plan was abandoned and the ship eventually named after the German nation - \\"Deutschland\\" for Germany. Delivered 10 April 1963, Deutschland was commissioned on 25 May 1966 and, like the sail training ship Gorch Fock, attached to the Naval Academy Mürwik in Flensburg-Mürwik. During her active service, thousands of cadets of the post-war West German navy completed the three-month practical part of their officer's training on board Deutschland. The ship remained in active service until she was decommissioned on 28 June 1990. Notwithstanding the prominent role that the ship had played in the naval officer training of the Bundesmarine from the mid-1960s for nearly 25 years, all attempts to preserve the ship, e.g. as a museum, failed. Deutschland was finally sold for scrap in October 1993 , and in January 1994 she was towed to Alang, India to meet her fate.

It followed a series of raids carried out by the forces of Frederick Barbarossa in Italy, which forced the submission of the leading city of Milan. The Emperor wished to establish his rights as feudal sovereign in the face of the growing independence of trading cities, which had won charters of municipal privilege during the earlier periods of strife between Papacy and Empire. The determination of the respective rights of the parties was left to four jurists from Bologna, the home of the great law school founded in 1088. The lawyers' decision favored the emperor, judging that his rule was by divine right, thus restoring the Imperial rights established since the period of nascent trade under rule of Emperor Otto. The lawyers proceed to define taxes, tolls, and exactions of various kinds to be imposed on trade. The Lombard cities would not accept the verdict, and it had to be enforced by war. Imperial forces dominated prior to the true unification of the Lombard League, and the city of Milan was razed to the ground in 1162. But the cities came to understand the value of a proper alliance post Destructionem Mediolani (\\"after the destruction of Milan\\"). The decisive battle in the continuing struggle was the Battle of Legnano in 1176, where Frederick was defeated by the Lombard League, and later forced to renege his rights of sovereignty below the Alps, in the Kingdom of Italy.

As it reaches Yarnbrook the brook becomes the River Biss. The Baptist church at North Bradley lies close to the River Biss and in the 19th century river baptisms took place with over 2000 in attendance; the bridge here is still called 'The Baptising'.Baptist church The river enters the centre of Trowbridge from the south-east through the Biss Meadows Country Park.

However, there was an attempt to supply the town; the Trowbridge Water Company was formed and piped water was turned on in the town on 30 September 1874. Supplies were inadequate, however, and the venture failed. The company had premises in Waterworks Road, now a residential area. On leaving the town centre, the Biss continues northwards through the Ladydown area.

Biography Pyatakov (party pseudonyms: Kievsky, Lyalin, Petro, Yaponets) was born August 6, 1890 in the settlement of the Mariinsky sugar factory. His father, Leonid Timofeyevich Pyatakov, was the chief engineer and director of the factory. He started political activity as an anarchist while he was in secondary school, but he joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1910. In 1912, he joined the Bolshevik faction. He was arrested and exiled to Siberia in 1912 with his partner, Evgenia Bosh, but they soon escaped and made their way to Switzerland, where they joined the émigré revolutionary community. Pyatakov and Bosh remained together until she committed suicide in 1925 because of chronic poor health. His opinion on some points of the theory and tactics of the revolutionary struggle contradicted that of the party's Central Committee. He was one of Vladimir Lenin's fiercest opponents on the national problem regarding both the course to be followed towards the socialist revolution and the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Bolsheviks' peace settlement with Germany. Pyatakov lived in Ukraine from March 1917, heading the Kyiv Committee of the party. He was repeatedly elected a member of the Central Committee but opposed the Ukrainian nationalists and stood for the transfer of power to the Soviets of Workers', Peasants' and Soldiers' Deputies in Ukraine. He also headed the Kyiv Military Revolutionary Committee. He declared that the party had to end the idea of self-identification of every nation. He stood on anti-chauvinistic international principles.Orest Subtelny, History of Ukraine In 1918, Pyatakov was a leader of a group of Left Communists in Ukraine. He was one of the initiators of Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine. At the First Congress of CP(b)U in Moscow, Pyatakov was elected as Central Committee Secretary and headed the opposition to the Hetman Rebellion in August 1918. From October 1918 to mid-January 1919, he was a head of the Provisional Worker’s and Peasant’s Government formed by Bolsheviks for the fight with the Directory, and he took part in the formation of the Red Army in Ukraine. In March 1919, he attended the 8th Congress of the Russian Communist Party in which he unsuccessfully opposed Lenin's position on national self-determination. He collaborated with Nikolai Bukharin; both authored the chapter on \\"The Economic Categories of Capitalism in the Transition Period\\" in The Economics of the Transformation Period, published in 1920. Pyatakov was placed in charge of the management of Donbass coal mining industry in 1921 and became a deputy head of the Gosplan (State Planning Committee) of the RSFSR in 1922 and deputy Chairman of the Supreme Council of the National Economy of the Soviet Union. The likeness of Pyatakov’s Left Communist views and Trotsky’s ideas led to his participation in practically all opposition trends that were designated as \\"Trotskyist\\". He was expelled from the party for belonging to the \\"Trotskyite-Zinovievite\\" bloc but was reinstated in 1928 after he renounced Trotskyism, and became Deputy head of Heavy Industries. He was appointed Chairman of the Board of the Soviet State Bank in 1929 and held the position for a year. In 1936, he was again accused of anti-party and anti-Soviet activity and expelled from the party. At his trial, he was accused of conspiring with Trotsky in connection with the case of the so-called Parallel anti-Soviet Party Centre to overthrow the Soviet government. He was accused of joining a conspiracy with the Nazis with the intent of seize power in the Soviet Union and of promising to reward Germany with large tracts of Soviet territory, including Ukraine. The prosecution presented evidence that he had secretly met with Trotsky in Norway for those purposes. On January 30, 1937, he was sentenced to death and executed. Pyatakov was posthumously rehabilitated in 1988, under Mikhail Gorbachev.

The women protest the imprisonments by attending Mass each Sunday wearing white dresses and then silently walking through the streets dressed in white clothing. The color white is chosen to symbolize peace. The movement received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought from the European Parliament in 2005. Origins During the Black Spring in 2003, the Cuban government arrested and summarily tried and sentenced 75 human rights activists, independent journalists, and independent librarians to terms of up to 28 years in prison, for receiving American government funds and collaborating with U.S diplomats. For its part, the Cuban government accused the 75 individuals of \\"acts against the independence or the territorial integrity of the state\\", including belonging to \\"illegal organizations\\", accepting money from the United States Interests Section in Havana and of \\"hijacking\\", \\"terrorist activities\\", and collaborating with foreign media.Rule of Law and Cuba from Florida State University In the view of the Committee to Protect Journalists, the Black Spring violated the most basic norms of international law, including Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantees everyone the right to \\"seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.\\" Under the leadership of Laura Pollán, the Ladies in White group was formed two weeks after the arrests.Rule of Law and Cuba Relatives of the prisoners began gathering on Sundays at St. Rita's Church in Havana to pray for their relatives. After each Mass, they began a ritual procession from the church to a nearby park. The white clothing they wear is reminiscent of the Argentine Madres de Plaza de Mayo, who used a similar strategy to demand information about their missing children from the 1970s military junta. Each marcher wears a button with a photo of her jailed relative and the number of years to which he has been sentenced. The Cuban government has criticized the Ladies in White for being a subversive association of American-backed terrorists. Cuba Solidarity Project. Entrevue avec Hebe de Bonafini On Palm Sunday in 2005, the pro-government Federation of Cuban Women sent 150 women to counter-protest the group. At times, sizable mobs have attacked the Ladies in White, yelling insults at them, and assisting the police to throw them into police buses. However, since Cardinal Jaime Lucas Ortega y Alamino intervened on their behalf in 2010, they have generally been allowed to protest outside of his church. The Sakharov Prize In 2005, the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought was awarded jointly to Reporters without Borders, Nigerian human rights lawyer Huawa Ibrahim, and the Ladies in White. Five of the leaders of the movement were selected to receive the prize: Laura Pollán, whose husband Hector Maseda is serving a 20-year sentence; Miriam Leiva, whose husband Oscar Espinosa Chepe has been conditionally released due to a serious illness; Berta Soler, whose husband Angel Moya Acosta is serving 20 years; Loida Valdes, whose husband Alfredo Felipe Fuentes was sentenced to 26 years; and Julia Núñez, whose husband Adolfo Fernández Saínz is serving 15 years. Some of the women were prevented from visiting their husbands to tell them of the award, but Laura Pollán told the Wall Street Journal that those who were told \\"are very happy and very proud\\". The Cuban government barred the group's leaders from attending the Sakharov Prize award ceremony in Strasbourg, France, drawing an appeal on the group's behalf from the European Parliament. Berta Soler received the award on the organization's behalf on her first-ever trip abroad in 2013. She was allowed to leave due to Cuba easing its travel regulations. Support from U.S. government The Cuban government alleges that the Ladies in White were created and financially sustained by the U.S. government as a means of destabilizing Cuba. Although it is unclear if the United States had a role in creating the organization, classified diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks show that the U.S. Interests Section requested funding for the Ladies in White and that working with the group figures prominently in the section’s activities. 2010 arrests At a protest in Havana on November 30, 2010, group member Ivonne Malleza Galano was arrested along with her husband Ignacio Martínez Montejo. She and her husband were holding a banner reading \\"Stop hunger, misery and poverty in Cuba\\" in Havana's Fraternity Park. Two police officers confiscated the banner, handcuffed her and Martínez, and put them into a police vehicle as a surrounding crowd demanded their release. When onlooker and fellow protester Isabel Haydee Alvarez Mosqueda objected to their arrest, she was detained as well. Malleza and Alvarez were both transferred to Havana's Manto Negro women’s jail. The three prisoners were held without charge, though their relatives were told the three were being investigated for \\"public disorder\\". The three arrests were denounced by numerous human rights groups, including the Havana-based Cuban Commission of Human Rights and National Reconciliation, which described the three prisoners as \\"three people who simply staged a small peaceful protest on the streets without any kind of force or violence\\". Amnesty International named the three prisoners of conscience and called for their immediate and unconditional release. The Irish-based organization Front Line called for their release on 15 December 2011. On 13 January 2012, US Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Mario Díaz- Balart, Albio Sires, and David Rivera issued a bipartisan statement urging the prisoners' release, calling their detention \\"appalling and unjust\\". US Senators Marco Rubio and Robert Menendez also issued a statement calling for their release and condemning the \\"unrelenting tyranny\\" of \\"the Castro brothers\\". Malleza, Martínez, and Alvarez were released on 20 January after 52 days in prison; the release came only a few hours after Amnesty International's announcement of their \\"prisoner of conscience\\" designation. The organization reported that authorities told the three that they would face \\"harsh sentences\\" if they continued their anti-government activities. The Ladies in White also participated in a vigil for imprisoned dissident Wilmar Villar Mendoza, who later died while on hunger strike. 2012 arrests Roughly seventy members of the Ladies in White were detained on the weekend of 16–17 March 2012, including Berta Soler, the group's current leader. Many of them were arrested on their way to or from mass, which they customarily attend together before their Sunday protest march. All seventy were released without charges on 19 March. However, they were instructed by Cuba's secret police that they would no longer be allowed to protest. A reporter for BBC News stated that protest groups like the Ladies in White were seeking to raise their profile in advance of an impending visit by Pope Benedict XVI--who was expected to discuss the issue of human rights with the Cuban government--and that the Cuban Communist Party was accordingly seeking to clamp down on protest. On 21 March, Amnesty International designated imprisoned Ladies in White member Yasmin Conyedo Riveron and her husband Yusmani Rafael Alvarez Esmori as prisoners of conscience. The two had been arrested in January and charged with \\"violence against a state official\\" following an argument with a local Communist Party official. The pair were released on bail on 5 April. On 9 December, police in Cuba arrested approximately 80 Ladies in White, allegedly using violence in detaining some of them. In all, 100 to 150 dissidents were placed under house arrest. 2015 arrests In February 2015, 53 members of Ladies in White were arrested after a march through Havana after a mass. 2016 arrests Hours before the historic visit of President Barack Obama to Cuba on 19 March, Cuban authorities arrested more than 50 members of Ladies in White during their weekly march. Some members believed Cuban authorities would allow them to protest without getting arrested due to the presence of international reporters and a foreign head of state. Soler offered the following thoughts prior to being arrested: \\"For us, it's very important that we do this so President Obama knows that there are women here fighting for the liberty of political prisoners. And he needs to know that we are here being repressed simply for exercising our right to express ourselves and manifest in a non-violent way.\\" See also * Censorship in Cuba * Cuban dissident movement * Human rights in Cuba * Mothers Against Repression * Mothers of Khavaran * Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo * Mourning Mothers * Saturday Mothers * Tiananmen Mothers  References  External links *Asociación Damas de Blanco (Ladies in White Official Association, in Spanish) *Damas de Blanco (Ladies in White in Spanish) *Damas de Blanco News - Noticias News about Ladies in White in English and Spanish (with online translation) *Ladies, Ibrahim and Reporters joint Sakharov prize winners European Parliament *Reporters without Frontiers - Cuba Annual report, 2005. *Sentencing documents - From dissidents' trials. *Thousands of articles about the Ladies in White *Human Rights Foundation article Category:Human rights organizations based in Cuba Category:Opposition to Fidel Castro Category:Women's organizations based in Cuba Category:Politics of Cuba Category:Civil disobedience Category:2003 establishments in Cuba Category:Sakharov Prize laureates ","title":"Ladies in White"},{"id":"3417908","text":"Royal Excelsior Sport's Club was a Belgian football club from Brussels that played in the first division from 1908 to 1913.

It was the first original novel based on the Star Trek television series intended for adult readers. It was preceded by a tie-in comic book line published by Gold Key and the novel Mission to Horatius by Mack Reynolds, all intended for younger readers. Blish aimed to kill off a popular character as a way to surprise readers, and during the novel's production chose Spock, with the aid of his wife, J.A. Lawrence. Reviews of the novel have been mixed. Some reviewers have directed criticism at the structure or tone of the novel, while others have expressed no enthusiasm for the work, overall. Spock Must Die! was reprinted numerous times with different cover art, including a cover by Kazuhiko Sano. The novel was collected in an omnibus for the Science Fiction Book Club in 1978. Prior to the release of Spock Must Die!, Blish had written three collections of short stories adapting episodes of the television series. The second collection, Star Trek 2 (), included an adaptation of the episode \\"Errand of Mercy\\", which the novel directly references in the second chapter. Plot Doctor Leonard McCoy (erroneously nicknamed \\"Doc\\" instead of \\"Bones\\" throughout, which Blish blamed an editor in one of his subsequent adaptation collections) and Engineer Montgomery Scott discuss McCoy's fear of the transporter. McCoy posits that an original person is killed upon dematerialization, and a duplicate is created at the destination. Scotty explains that the technology does not destroy the original object but causes every single particle to undergo a \\"Dirac jump\\" to its new location, and that converting a human-sized mass to energy would blow up the ship. McCoy is not convinced, and he wonders what happens to the soul in a transporter beam. The conversation is interrupted by the news that the Organians appear to have been destroyed by the Klingon Empire. The Organians had been enforcing a peace treaty between the Empire and the Federation, and the planet's disappearance is a threat to the peace. As the Enterprise is a long way from Organia, Scotty develops an modification of the transporter that uses tachyons to create a copy of a crewman that could be transported to Organia long before the ship can reach the planet. Spock is chosen, but a permanent duplicate is created unexpectedly upon transport, as something at or on Organia has functioned as a perfect, impenetrable, mirror for the tachyon transporter beam. The crew is unable to distinguish between the two Spocks. Kirk arbitrarily designates one as \\"Spock One\\" and the other as \\"Spock Two\\". Spock Two soon argues that the duplicate will be operating on a pro-Klingon agenda, since, being physically reversed, he is also ethically reversed as well, and he states that the duplicate must therefore be killed, \\"even if it is I\\". After faking a mental breakdown and barricading himself in sick bay, Spock One escapes in a stolen shuttlecraft which he has adapted to warp drive. This offers strong evidence that he is the duplicate and traitor. The crew find corroboration of this when they discover that Spock One used the Enterprise's science facilities to manufacture chirality-reversed amino acids. He had undergone a total left-to-right inversion down to the atomic lever during his creation. To survive, he had to infuse the inverse forms of amino acids into his diet. McCoy explains that such a meagre diet would have induced deficiency diseases in a human, but that a Vulcan is able to endure it indefinitely. The Enterprise receives communiques indicating that the war is going badly for the Federation. Upon arriving at Organia, the crew are affected by a powerful mental disturbance centered on the planet. Kirk, Scotty and Spock transport to the surface, but Kirk identifies the Spock with him as the duplicate Spock (Spock One). Realizing the danger to Kirk and Scotty, via their psychic link, Spock Two transports to the planet and kills his duplicate. The landing party discover that the Organians are not dead, but imprisoned. A weapon deployed by the Klingons has restrained their mental abilities, preventing them from expressing their thoughts. As thought- creatures, the restraint will ultimately destroy them if it is not disabled. Scotty is able to disable the weapon and the thought screen surrounding the planet, freeing the Organians. In retaliation, the Klingon race is confined to their homeworld, and the Klingon commander, Koloth, is trapped in a bubble of asymptotically slowing time, unaware of his fate. The Enterprise continues on its five-year mission of exploration. Production Spock was killed off in the story by James Blish to surprise readers. For the first original Star Trek novel for adults, Blish wanted to surprise readers by killing a popular character. Unexpectedly, Spock had been the most popular character in the television series—more popular than Captain Kirk. Blish discussed his premise with his wife, J.A. Lawrence, only to discover she preferred Spock to Kirk, as well. Following their discussion, Blish chose to kill Spock. The plot, featuring both the Klingons and the Organians, is a follow-up to the first season episode \\"Errand of Mercy\\", which had previously been adapted into a short story by Blish, published in Star Trek 2 (). Spock Must Die! contains a number of references to other works: Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast series is hinted at by an alien species found on Organia called \\"gormenghastlies\\" by Kirk; Uhura says she is able to transmit a message in Eurish, a reference to James Joyce's Finnegans Wake; Scotty uses the word \\"mathom\\" to describe the objects that have materialized on the ship as part of his transporter experiments, which is a reference to The Lord of the Rings.. Another alien species mentioned is the \\"reepicheep\\", based on the name of a Talking Mouse in Prince Caspian and Voyage of the Dawn Treader. The novel's conclusion does not reset the universe, as was common in episodes of the television series. Instead, the Organians have confined the Klingon race to their homeworld for a thousand years, unable to take advantage of space flight, and the antagonist Commander Koloth is trapped in an asymptotically slowing distortion of local time, unaware of his punishment. It is likely Blish would have continued to explore the results of these changes in a follow-up novel. Spock Must Die! was released after the cancellation of the television series. Blish included a rally cry in his \\"Author's Notes\\" to encourage fans to advocate for the series renewal. Sales of the novel following its release were promising, but Blish's death in 1975 ended all plans for follow-up. Spock, Messiah! by Theodore Cogswell and Charles Spano was released in , it is not a sequel to Spock Must Die!, though they have similar names. Spock Must Die! was collected in the omnibus The Star Trek Reader IV (), for the Science Fiction Book Club. Also included were the short story collections Star Trek 10 (), and Star Trek 11 (). Bantam Books reprinted and reissued the novel twenty times from to . The final printing featured an original cover designed by Japanese artist Kazuhiko Sano. Reception In A Clash of Symbols (), Brian M. Stableford described the novel as a \\"combination of space opera and whimsy, quite typical of the Star Trek mythos\\". Stableford believed the sequences in the novel would have been too expensive for the television series, however, the novel's structure was similar to an actual episode containing \\"sub-climaxes that one can easily imagine would bracket commercial breaks\\". Strother B. Purdy referred to novel's text as a \\"rather well-written\\" example of the duplication of characters in science fiction, in his study The Hole in the Fabric (). Purdy was also impressed by novel's play on elements in the vein of Martin Gardner's The Ambidextrous Universe and Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass. Astrobiologist Daniel Glavin was quoted in the issue of the New Scientist, saying it was an \\"intriguing idea\\" and that Spock Must Die! is \\"certainly a novel turn in this twistiest of tales: the story of how life came to be left- handed\\". Ellen Kozak reviewed Spock Must Die! as \\"one of the better original novels written from the series\\" in the issue of Science Fiction and Fantasy Book Review. Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (), by Don D'Ammassa, synopsizes the novel as \\"interesting historically, but … a mediocre piece of fiction\\". George Mann criticised Blish's Star Trek fiction, including Spock Must Die!, as \\"obviously written primarily for money\\", and that Blish does not display the \\"literary and intellectual skill evident in his earlier work\\". Ellen Cheeseman-Meyer reviewed the novel for Tor.com, in 2012, saying the women aboard Enterprise sexually desiring Spock (Spock One) was \\"unsettling\\". And that the novel offers \\"sex with Spock, the magical half-breed\\", as the \\"cure for racism that 23rd century women cannot find anywhere else\\". However, Cheeseman-Meyer noted Spock Must Die! was \\"worth reading as a celebration of the world Star Trek envisioned, however strange that could sometimes be\\".

History Following the opening of the Eastern Goldfields Railway to Kalgoorlie in December 1887, a service from Perth commenced. Although not named, it was often referred to as the Great Eastern Express, Kalgoorlie Express or Kalgoorlie Passenger. Following the opening of the Trans-Australian Railway in October 1917, its importance increased with the commencement of the Trans-Australian Express from Port Augusta in South Australia. By May 1921, a separate overnight express for interstate passengers and mail was introduced and this became the connecting train with the Trans- Australian Express. On 4 June 1938, the service was relaunched and renamed The Westland with Pr class locomotives rostered.\\"Westland\\" enters service The West Australian 4 June 1938 It included sitting and sleeping cars (both first and second class). A dining car was attached between Perth and Northam where it was detached having served dinner on the eastbound service. It was then attached to the westbound service for breakfast. Refreshment rooms were also provided at major stations for passengers wishing to purchase cheaper snacks and drinks. World War II austerity measures saw the lounge cars removed until March 1946. On 28 March 1948, it was again relaunched with new AH class steel sleeping carriages with the other carriages refurbished. This was to be the last improvement to the train, although the introduction of the X class diesel-electric locomotives in 1954 marginally reduced traveling time. Demise With the line between Perth and Kalgoorlie gauge converted to standard gauge, The Westland was replaced on 15 June 1969 by the Trans Australian which now operated from Port Pirie through to East Perth. Right up to that time drinking water in the second class sleepers was provided for passengers from water bags slung from the carriage platform railing, and a stack of fire wood was kept on the platform of the dining car to fuel its stoves. The standard gauge line followed a new alignment through the Avon Valley of the Darling Scarp east of Perth. This was the first section of the new line to be constructed, tracks on this section being and dual gauge. For a short time before its demise, The Westland was routed via the new Avon Valley line, and the original ascent of the Darling Scarp via the Swan View Tunnel and Chidlow was closed.

It lies on the Afon Gwyrfai in Nant y Betws between Moel Eilio and Mynydd Mawr in the northern part of Snowdonia National Park. It has an area of , and is over deep. At the southern end is the small village of Rhyd Ddu. Although it is now dammed at the northern end, below the Castell Cidwm ridge, near the village of Betws Garmon this has not substantially increased the size of the natural glacial moraine lake that has existed since the last ice age. The lake is very deep and is one of the few lakes in Wales to support a natural population of Arctic char. The lake also is home to brown trout and there are otters that are regularly seen at the Castell Cidwm end. The lake has shared ownership between Lawrence Jones (businessman) owner of the Castell Cidwm estate at the Northern end and Welsh water, who own the right hand side that supplies the weir. The lake was originally owned by the Marquis of Anglesey who used the Castell Cidwm country house as his hunting lodge. The A4085 runs past the lake; however there are no lay-byes for picnics and the east side is now considered a Nature Reserve, and fishing is not permitted in the tree-lined area beside the road all the way down to Castell Cidwm. Fishing permits can be purchased however there are better lakes in the surrounding areas which are more sheltered and better stocked. This lake is particularly dangerous when out on a small boat as fast winds come down off Snowdon and through the valley making it impossible to row back up the lake. This lake is a reservoir and engines are not permitted. Even with an electric motor it is almost impossible to navigate up the lake into the wind once it picks up. On the far side of the lake the land was planted as a commercial soft-wood forest and is now owned by Natural Resources Wales, however logging has been stopped to prevent the water in the lake being polluted by silt generated by logging activities. In 2005 an outbreak of Cryptosporidiosis in the water supply drawn from the lake led to improvements being planned for the water treatment works. Work started in 2009 down stream on an updated water treatment plant which included froth flotation, upward flow clarifiers and UV sterilisation of the treated water. The revised plant came online in September 2010 Further up the mountainside is the Welsh Highland Railway, which offers splendid views of the lake from the south. Road and railway both run from Caernarfon to Beddgelert and then through the Aberglaslyn Pass to Porthmadog. The railway comes from Caernarfon and as it approaches the lake veers left from the Castell Cidwm rock face through a hand carved rock cutting and under a small bridge before heading up the east side of the lake towards Snowdon Ranger railway station and later Rhyd Ddu railway station at the start of the Rhyd Ddu path to the summit of Snowdon. Rail and road run side by side for over half a mile to the summit of the mountain pass at Pitt's Head where the road passes over the railway before descending steeply through Nant Colwyn to Beddgelert. Pitt's Head is also the starting point of the 'Beddgelert' branch of the Rhyd Ddu path to Snowdon. Midway along the eastern shore of the lake is the starting point of the easier but less sensational Snowdon Ranger path to the summit of Snowdon. This route makes an excellent way down Snowdon as the view of the lake is magnificent whatever the weather. Since the Middle Ages the overland route from Caernarfon to Beddgelert via Llyn Cwellyn and then via the River Glaslyn and the Traeth Mawr to Cardigan Bay was often the preferred alternative to the long voyage round the Llŷn Peninsula.

John and Dorothy had two daughters: Jane Pentecost Fenby and Gwendolyn Ann Pentecost Arnold. Pentecost was Distinguished Professor of Bible Exposition, Emeritus, at Dallas Theological Seminary, one of only two so honored. He held a B.A. from Hampden-Sydney College (1937), in addition to Th.M. (1941) and Th.D. (1956) degrees from Dallas Theological Seminary. During his academic career he taught biblical subjects for over 60 years (Philadelphia College of Bible, 1948–55; Dallas Theological Seminary, 1955-2014).

Writings Pentecost is possibly best known for his published writings, which are predominantly focused on issues of Christian living and the eschatological scriptures. Pentecost took a Premillennial and Pretribulational view of the unfulfilled prophetic passages of the apocalyptic biblical literature. He had a Dispensationalist position, however, and his Things to Come (1958) is characterized by a comprehensive review of almost every view on the biblical prophetic subject matter that has any form of prominence.Prophetic writing elements Bibliography * Things to Come, Zondervan, 1958 * Prophecy for Today : God's Purpose and Plan for Our Future, Zondervan, 1961 * Will Man Survive? * The Parables of the Kingdom * Pattern for Maturity (since retitled Designed to Be Like Him) * The Joy of Intimacy with God : A Bible Study Guide to 1 John, Discovery House * Faith That Endures : A Practical Commentary on the Book of Hebrews, 2000 rev. ed. * The Divine Comforter : The Person and Work of the Holy Spirit, Kregel, 1963 * Designed to be Like Him : Understanding God's Plan for Fellowship, Conduct, Conflict, and Maturity, 1966 * Your Adversary, the Devil, 1969 * Life’s Problems-God’s Solutions : Answers to 15 of Life's most Perplexing Problems, 1971 * The Joy of Living : Study of Philippians, Kregel 1973 * Design for Living : Lessons on Holiness from the Sermon on the Mount, Kregel, 1975 * The Sermon on the Mount : Contemporary Insights for a Christian Lifestyle, Multnomah Press, Portland, 1980 * The Words and Works of Jesus Christ : A Study of the Life of Christ, Zondervan, 1981 * A Harmony of the Words & Works of Jesus Christ, Zondervan, 1981 * The Parables of Jesus : Lessons in Life from the Master Teacher, 1982 * Thy Kingdom Come : Tracing God's Kingdom Program and Covenant Promises Throughout History, Kregel, 1995 * Things Which become Sound Doctrine : Doctrinal Studies of Fourteen Crucial Words of Faith, Kregel, 1996 * Design for Discipleship : Discovering God's Blueprint for the Christian Life, Kregel, 1996 * New Wine: A Study of Transition in the Book of Acts.Kregel, 2010 Notes References  External links * Photo and booklist.

The game was released for the ZX Spectrum in 1984, with ports for the Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64 in 1985. The game has the player control a Panavia Tornado fighter jet, tasked to destroy targets throughout the map. Tornado Low Level received positive reviews for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions by video game critics, both on release and in retrospective reviews. The game was also a commercial success, with the Spectrum version debuting at number three on Personal Computer Games top fifty charts. The success of the game led to a sequel titled Cyclone, which featured a similar graphical style and similar play. Gameplay Flying towards a target to destroy The player controls a Panavia Tornado fighter jet and must manoeuvre the plane at low altitude in order to destroy targets on the landscape by flying very low over them at high speed, while avoiding pylons, bridges, and other structures. Each target is represented as a small circle. After five targets are destroyed, new targets are placed in more difficult positions, like in the water. Before a level begins, the map of the area is shown, with the five targets being highlighted. Each level has a time limit, while the Tornado has a limited fuel supply and can only carry ten bombs. Running low on fuel and time causes a warning sound to be triggered. Landing on the airfield refuels the aircraft. The Tornado has two speeds. At high speed, it can travel to targets faster. However, it uses fuel at a much greater rate. This is depicted graphically by the plane's wings being swept back. The screen displays a fuel gauge, altimeter, a map of the game, and the time the player has left. The 3D aspect of the game allows the Tornado to not only move on the x-axis (left/right on screen) and the y-axis (up/down on screen), but also on the z-axis, representing the height of the plane in the sky. This movement is supported graphically by allowing the Tornado to fly underneath bridges, with the plane temporarily disappearing from view as it does so. Telephone lines can also be flown under in the same way. Additionally, when the Tornado flies over a building, its shadow \\"climbs\\" up the wall, again giving the illusion of a 3rd dimension. Development Tornado Low Level was developed by Costa Panayi and published by the United Kingdom-based company Vortex Software, co- founded by Panayi. Before getting into game development, he was a design engineer for British Aerospace. The idea for the game originated from the popularity of Psion's flight simulator program Flight Simulation. Panayi considered the game to be a \\"progression of the ideas\\" he had in his previous title Android Two. It was originally released for the ZX Spectrum in 1984. Publisher Ocean Software later acquired the rights to the game to release it for the Commodore 64. An Amstrad CPC version was also released, rewritten to use the full capabilities of the computer. The CPC version was programmed by David Aubrey-Jones. Reception and legacy Upon release, Tornado Low Level was a commercial success, with the ZX Spectrum version debuting at number three on Personal Computer Games top fifty charts. Both the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions of the game received positive reviews from video game critics. Computer & Video Games called it the best flight game on the Spectrum. Bob Wade, writing for Amstrad Action, praised the game for its graphics and for having the fastest and smoothest scrolling on the Amstrad computer. A reviewer for Amtix also praised the scrolling, but criticized the graphics for looking \\"blocky\\". Crash noted a lack of instructions and indications of how to complete the game's objectives. Retrospective reviews were also positive. Peter Parrish, writing for Eurogamer, called it \\"Gorgeous, absorbing and, despite the subject matter, surprisingly non-violent\\". Nick Thrope, writing in Retro Gamer, gave it praise for its entertainment value. Jim Watson of ZX Computing listed it as one of the best games for the ZX Spectrum in 1984. The game was voted number ten in Your Sinclairs \\"Official Top 100 Games of All Time\\". Retro Gamer, meanwhile, ranked it as the eleventh best game for the Spectrum. In 1987, Wade listed it as one of the best games for the then two-year old Amstrad CPC. With the success of Tornado Low Level, Vortex Software released Cyclone in 1985. A sequel to T.L.L., Cyclone has the player fly a helicopter to collect medical supplies in the middle of a cyclone phenomenon.

Like almost all theropods, it was a bipedal predator. Only a juvenile skeleton has been found, representing an animal over 7 meters (23 ft) long and weighing over 600 kilograms (1300 lb), which indicates an adult would have been even larger. It is the most completely known theropod from the eastern part of North America. Fossils of Appalachiosaurus were found in central Alabama, from the Demopolis Chalk Formation. This formation dates to the middle of the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous, or around 77 million years ago. Fossil material assigned to A. montegomeriensis is also known from the Donoho Creek and Tar Heel-Coachman formations of North and South Carolina. Discovery and naming The type specimen was found by Auburn University geologist David King in eastern North America in July 1982. This dinosaur was named after the region of the eastern United States known as Appalachia, which also gave its name to the ancient island continent on which Appalachiosaurus lived. Both are named after the Appalachian Mountains. The generic name also includes the Greek word sauros (\\"lizard\\"), the most common suffix used in dinosaur names. There is one known species, A. montgomeriensis, which is named after Montgomery County in the U.S. state of Alabama. Both genus and species were named in 2005 by paleontologists Thomas Carr, Thomas Williamson, and David Schwimmer. Description Restoration Appalachiosaurus is so far known from only partial remains, including parts of the skull and mandible (lower jaw), as well as several vertebrae, parts of the pelvis, and most of both hindlimbs. These remains are housed at the McWane Science Center in Birmingham, Alabama. There are several open sutures between bones of the skull, indicating that the animal was not an adult. Several elements are crushed, but the specimen is still informative and shows many unique characteristics, or apomorphies. Several of these apomorphies have been identified in the skull, and the claws of the feet show an unusual protrusion on the end closest to the body. A row of six low crests lines the top of the snout, similar to the Asian Alioramus, although most tyrannosaur species exhibit ornamentation to varying degrees on top of the snout. The only remains found are from a juvenile, meaning that the size and weight of the adult is not known. Appalachiosaurus is significantly different and more derived than another early tyrannosaur from eastern North America, Dryptosaurus. The forelimbs of Appalachiosaurus are poorly known. Large tyrannosaurids are characterized by proportionally small forelimbs and hands with two functional digits each; except some reports of a humerus ascribed to Appalachiosaurus, no forelimb material are known. Early reconstructions gave it long arms with three fingers, but they are now thought to have been much shorter, with only two fingers. Museum mounts have been corrected accordingly. Appalachiosaurus had a bite force of around 32,500 newtons, or 7,193 pounds per square inch. Classification Outdated skeletal reconstruction with large, three fingered forelimbs. The only known specimen Appalachiosaurus was complete enough to be included in phylogenetic analyses using cladistics. The first was performed before the animal had even been named, and found Appalachiosaurus to be a member of the albertosaurine subfamily of Tyrannosauridae, which also includes Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus.Holtz, T.R. (2004). \\"Tyrannosauroidea.\\" In: Weishampel, D.A., Dodson, P., & Osmolska, H. (Eds.). The Dinosauria (2nd Edition). Berkeley: University of California Press. Pp. 111–136. The original description also included a cladistic analysis, finding A. montgomeriensis to be a basal tyrannosauroid outside of Tyrannosauridae. However, Asian tyrannosaurs like Alioramus, and Alectrosaurus were excluded, as was Eotyrannus from England. Earlier tyrannosaurs such as Dilong and Guanlong had not been described at the time this analysis was performed. These exclusions may have a significant effect on the phylogeny. Below is a cladogram published in 2013 by Loewen et al.. Possible pathology Two vertebrae of the tail were found to be fused together, possibly a result of new bone growth following some sort of injury.

Most of the structure is made from earth, but the centre section, housing the hydroelectric turbines, was built from concrete. This section is high. Kanji Dam is one of the longest dams in the world. Power station The dam was designed to have a generating capacity of ; however, only 8 of its 12 turbines have been installed, reducing the capacity to . The dam generates electricity for all the large cities in Nigeria. Some of the electricity is sold to the neighbouring country of Niger. In addition, occasional droughts have made the Niger's water flow unpredictable, diminishing the dam's electrical output. ASC Leiden - Rietveld Collection - Nigeria 1970 - 1973 - 01 - 083 Kainji Dam.

Discharge flooding In October 1998 in response to upstream flooding, a torrent of water was released from the dam, bursting the river banks. Downstream from the dam 60 villages were flooded. Domestic animals drowned and dikes as well as several farms were washed away. Dam officials were criticized for waiting too long before starting, then dumping too much water.  Lake Kainji  Kainji Lake measures about long and about at its widest point, and supports irrigation and a local fishing industry. In 1999, uncoordinated opening of floodgates led to local flooding of about 60 villages.

It is located some 20 km from the downtown of the city. It is bordered by the neighborhoods of Villa Adelina, Carapachay and Martínez on the north; Villa Ballester on the west; Florida Este in the south; and Olivos to the east. The border streets are Mariano Moreno, Bartolomé Mitre Avenue, Paraná, National Highway 9 (Panamericana), Antonio Malaver, Alexander Fleming, Luis María Drago, Primera Junta, Montes de Oca, Capitán Cajaraville, Juramento, Carlos Calvo, Albarellos, and Belgrano. There are many sports clubs in Munro such as Unión Vecinal de Fomento Munro (founded on 1922), Olivos Rugby Club (1927), Club Unión de Munro (1946), Club Social y Deportivo Industrial Munro (1947). Some of Munro's local industries are: Atanor, Fabriloza, Colorín, Virulana, Ripán, Telagoma, Bayer, Gillette and other factories of clothing, lumber, steel, food, etc. In the town were located the Lumiton filming studios (they still exist today as a museum of the movies filmed there).  Population  The historic Lumiton Studios, today the Museum of Cinema The city area is approximately 5.8 km² and is populated by 35,844 (), being the third most populous city in the partido, with 13.1% of its total population. In 1991 there were 36,188 citizens, which implies a 1% drop compared to 2001.  History  The neighborhood of Munro was born with the construction of a station of the Ferrocarril Córdoba Central rail line (now Ferrocarril General Belgrano) on April 30, 1912. The English railway company, associated to the Compañía Argentina de Tierras del Norte, acquired lands near the railway and charged its station chief, Alfredo Dionisio Godoy, the lands sale. The station has its name after Duncan Mackay Munro, who worked at the railway company. On June 11, 1922, 49 neighbors led by Alfredo Dionisio Godoy founded the Unión Vecinal de Fomento de Munro. With the population growth, many stores were opened that formed an important commercial centre. Munro was also the site of Lumiton Studios, a movie production house founded by local radio pioneer Enrique Susini which, from 1931 to 1952, turned out over 180 full-length films and became among the best-known in Argentine cinema. On November 11, 1961, the partido's first school was founded: School Nº4 Domingo Faustino Sarmiento. On March 22, 1965, the Santa María Reina church is founded, and from 1996 it belongs to the San Isidro obispado. In 1981 Mitre Avenue was repaired, thus modernizing the commercial centre. In 1995 the Centro Cultural Munro (Munro Cultural Center) was inaugurated with a capacity for 870 people. Education The area once had a German school, Deutsche Schule Munro.\\"Deutscher Bundestag 4.

In some cases it is found that this occurs on the left side of the heart rather than the right side.  Pathogenesis DORV occurs in multiple forms, with variability of great artery position and size, as well as of ventricular septal defect (VSD) location. It can occur with or without transposition of the great arteries. The clinical manifestations are similarly variable, depending on how the anatomical defects affect the physiology of the heart, in terms of altering the normal flow of blood from the RV and left ventricle (LV) to the aorta and pulmonary artery. For example: :*in DORV with a subaortic VSD, blood from the LV flows through the VSD to the aorta and blood from the RV flows mainly to the pulmonary artery, yielding physiology similar to ventricular septal defect :*in DORV with a subpulmonic VSD (called Taussig-Bing syndrome), blood from the LV flows through the VSD to the pulmonary artery and blood from the RV flows mainly to the aorta, yielding physiology similar to Transposition of the Great Arteries :but if there is pulmonic stenosis in addition, physiology resembles Tetralogy of Fallot :*in other forms of DORV, blood from both ventricles is substantially mixed in the RV, yielding physiology that resembles a large VSD :but again, if there is pulmonic stenosis, physiology resembles Tetralogy of Fallot Treatment DORV is treated with surgery. Epidemiology DORV affects between 1% and 3% of people born with congenital heart defects. Chromosomal abnormalities were reported in about 40% of reported cases in the medical literature.

In DORV, instead of the normal situation where blood from the left ventricle (LV) flows out to the aorta and blood from the right ventricle (RV) flows out to the pulmonary artery, both aorta and pulmonary artery are connected to the RV, and the only path for blood from the LV is across the VSD. When the VSD is subpulmonic (sitting just below the pulmonary artery), the LV blood then flows preferentially to the pulmonary artery. Then the RV blood, by default, flows mainly to the aorta. The clinical manifestations of a Taussig-Bing anomaly, therefore, are much like those of dextro-Transposition of the great arteries (but the surgical repair is different). It can be corrected surgically also with the arterial switch operation (ASO). It is managed with Rastelli procedure. It is named after Helen B.

Report of the Special Investigation Commission  In the report of the Special Investigation Commission that was formed by Alþingi, DV was specially noted as almost the only newspaper in Iceland that questioned the Icelandic banks. As a result, the paper acquired broader readership.  Controversies  In January 2006, DV ran a cover story claiming that former elementary school teacher Gísli Hjartarson had sexually abused two or more boys in his home town of Ísafjörður, Northwest Iceland. Gísli, who had not been charged with the abuse, committed suicide the same day and cited the coming news coverage as his reason in a letter he left for his family, although he did not name DV specifically. The accusers of the man stated their displeasure with DV's article as it ruined the progress of the case as well as the continued harassment from their reporters. The event caused an uproar against DV with 32.044 people signing an online petition demanding a new editorial policy. On 13 January 2006, the editors, Mikael Torfason and Jónas Kristjánsson, resigned from their post.

It was there that he was first exposed to Marxist political literature, including the official newspaper of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, Iskra, which he read as part of an underground political circle. =Political career= Nikolai Muralov Early in 1902, Muralov traveled to Moscow, where he was arrested by the Tsarist political police for the first time. He was held for three months before being released. Muralov joined another underground Marxist circle at Serpukhov, Moscow Oblast, later that same year and became involved in the zemstvo movement. He took a job as an assistant agronomist in the nearby town of Podolsk in 1903, joining the Bolshevik Party at this time. In the fall of 1905, Muralov made his way to Moscow, where he took an active part in the 1905 Revolution. He remained in the city until the rebellion's suppression by the military in January 1906, participating further in the revolutionary movement in the Don region and at Taganrog, where he came to be regarded as a party specialist in agricultural affairs. He was arrested at Taganrog for a second time later that same year and was imprisoned at Nikolaev for a protracted period. After his release, Muralov returned briefly to Moscow before taking a job in the Tula district as an estate manager in 1907. There he helped open a tearoom, disguised as a unit of the Temperance Society, but in reality a cover for the underground political movement. Muralov was drafted into the military during World War I, serving in infantry and transport regiments until the outbreak of the February Revolution in 1917. After that time he became active as an organizer of the Bolshevik faction in the military, helping to establish the soldiers' section of the Moscow Soviet. During the October Revolution he was a member of the Moscow Revolutionary Military Council (RVS) and part of the revolutionary headquarters staff. He led a detachment to capture the Moscow radio station and to open the prisons, freeing political prisoners. He was a member of the RVS of the 3rd Army during the Russian Civil War. At the end of the civil war Muralov was named a member of the governing Collegium of the People's Commissariat of Agriculture. He also continued to serve as a district commander of the Red Army in the Moscow Military District and the North Caucus Military District. Muralov was one of a handful of close personal friends of Leon Trotsky during his Russian interlude.Jean-Jacques Marie, \\"Nikolay Ivanovich Muralov,\\" in Georges Haupt and Jean-Jacques Marie, Makers of the Russian Revolution: Biographies of Bolshevik Leaders. [1969] C.I.P. Ferdinand and D.M. Bellos, trans. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1974; pp. 173-175. He became a signatory to the dissident Declaration of the 46 in October 1923, which ushered in a period of oppositionist political activity. Muralov spoke in defense of the Left Opposition at the 15th Congress of the VKP(b) in December 1927, during which he was heckled mercilessly. Following the congress he was expelled from the VKP(b) and assigned to rural work in Siberia. Muralov was one of four signatories of a letter to the 16th Congress of the VKP(b) in 1930, a document which demanded free expression for all political oppositions. He continued to work in Siberian agriculture, but refused to denounce either his friend Trotsky or his political past, gaining repute as the last of the leading Bolsheviks to have rejected such measures. =Arrest and trial= Muralov was arrested by the Soviet secret police (OGPU) on April 17, 1936. He was named as one of eight unindicted co-conspirators in the so-called Kemerovo Trial of October 1936, a highly-publicized trial which asserted that Trotskyist saboteurs had caused an explosion at the Kemerovo Central Mine — a blast in which 12 miners had died and 14 others suffered serious injury.Vladimir Rogovin, 1937: Stalin's Year of Terror. Frederick S. Choate, trans. Oak Park, MI: Mehring Books, 1998; pp. 96-97. The Kemerovo mine explosion and trial, which had resulted in death sentences for all nine defendants, was made the basis for the second of three great public show trials of the Great Purge — the so-called \\"Trial of the Anti-Soviet Trotskyist Center.\\" This trial, held over an eight day period in January 1937, is best remembered for its lead defendants Iurii Piatakov and Karl Radek. Muralov was another of the leading defendants in this public spectacle. Muralov's abasement was complete during the proceeding. During his direct testimony answering the questions of prosecutor Andrey Vyshinsky, Muralov indicated that he had declined to provide the confession demanded by the secret police until December 5, 1936 — eight months after his arrest.\\"Evening Session, January 25: Examination of the Defendant Muralov,\\" Moscow News, Feb. 3-10, 1937, pp. 17-18. After this date, he signed on to an elaborate confession. He dutifully testified: > \\"The beginning of my downfall must be dated from the moment I signed the > first document against the Party. That was the declaration of the 46 of > 1923. With this my downfall began. Later I was drawn into the Trotskyite > organization and so on right up to my expulsion from the Party and exile to > West Siberia.\\" Muralov asserted:\\"For more than ten years I was a faithful soldier of Trotsky, the evil-doer of the working class, the fascist agent worthy of all our contempt, that enemy of the working class and the Soviet Union.\\" He confessed to have established a Siberian Trotskyist center in Novosibirsk and to have received in 1932 a letter from Trotsky's son, Leon Sedov, letters containing Trotsky's instruction written in invisible ink which \\"proposed to hasten the terrorist acts against Stalin, Voroshilov, Kaganovich, and Kirov.\\" Muralov claimed that he had coordinated the organization of small terrorist cells with several other defendants in the current trial, including Piatakov and Radek, and to have played a part in directly organizing an assassination attempt against Stalin's right hand man, V.M.Molotov in which a car in which he was traveling was to intentionally be driven and rolled at high speed into a ravine. In accord with the severity of the crimes to which he confessed,Secret police methods of torture and persuasion have been explored in vast detail in the memoir and scholarly literature. Muralov was sentenced to death. Following his death sentence, Muralov drafted an appeal for commutation of his sentence to the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party. He wrote: > \\"I am sixty years old. I want to devote the remainder of my life fully to > the good of constructing our great Motherland. I take the liberty of > beseeching the Central Executive Committee of the USSR to spare my > life.\\"quoted in Rogovin, 1937, p. 126. The appeal was to be unsuccessful. =Death and Legacy= Nikolay Ivanovich Muralov was executed on February 1, 1937. An official softening of the historical assessment of Muralov began even under the regime of Leonid Brezhnev. In 1966 the newspaper Sovetskaia Rossiia lauded the Old Bolshevik Muralov as \\"a courageous and stalwart Leninist, and illustrious statesman, and a solid Bolshevik.\\"Quoted in Jean-Jacques Marie, \\"Nikolay Ivanovich Muralov,\\" op. cit., p. 175. Muralov was formally accorded posthumous rehabilitation in April 1986.

Life Henri Thomas was born at Anglemont, Vosges, and grew up in the Alsace/Lorraine region of France. He moved to Paris to attend the prestigious Henri IV high school, working with the noted essayist Alain. However, his teaching and academic career faltered and he dedicated himself to writing full-time from 1935. He mixed with many influential intellectuals and writers in Paris in the 1930s and 1940s, most notably Gide and Paulhan. His first novel \\"The Coal Bucket\\" was published by Gallimard in 1940, as were the majority of his literary production (novels, short stories, journals, poems, essays, etc.) for the next forty odd years. In the ‘forties he did his military service, got married, worked on a number of literary reviews and separated from his wife. In 1945, Thomas took a job with the BBC in London and lived and worked there for about ten years. Also during this period he met the woman who would later become his second wife and their daughter was born while the couple was in London. In 1958, he was hired as a professor at Brandeis University in the United States, where he lived and worked for two years. After his return to France in 1960 he worked as a literary editor and translator at Gallimard and spent his time primarily in Paris and in Brittany, although after his second wife died in 1965, Thomas began to live mostly in Brittany. He moved to a rest home in Paris in 1991 after his health failed and died there in 1993.

Outlaw country legends Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson have been associated with the distinctive Texas Sound, while the late Oklahoma singer-songwriter Bob Childers is widely recognized as the Father of Oklahoma Red Dirt music.

Like those two, red dirt music grew from a specific place in Stillwater.

One of many bands representing Red Dirt music—as their name signifies—is the Red Dirt Rangers. The Rangers (John Cooper, Brad Piccolo and Ben Han) have been making music since the late 1980s and, along with Childers, were part of The Farm's earliest musical brotherhood, which also included Jimmy LaFave and Tom Skinner. These musicians and others jammed in the living room, on the front porch, in the garage (known as the Gypsy Cafe), and around campfires in the yard where \\"the sheer joy of creating music with friends transcended everything else.\\" Cooper said, \\"The Farm was as much an attitude as a physical structure. It allowed a setting where freedom rang and all things were possible. Out of this setting came the music.\\" The physical structure burned down in 2003. Definition Critics say that Red Dirt can best be likened to the indie genre of rock 'n' roll as there is no definitive sound that can be attributed to all the bands in the movement. Most Red Dirt artists would be classified by the music industry as Americana, folk, or alt-country, though the range of sounds in the Red Dirt spectrum goes beyond these genres. It has been described as a mix of folk, rock, country, bluegrass, blues, Western swing, and honky tonk, with even a few Mexican influences.

Some guys are more rock, some guys are more country, and there's everything in between,\\" Jackson said.

Trying to analyze it, you see that a lot of artists carry the same influences going back to the days of Bob Wills and Woody Guthrie (for the older artists and bands), and then you have new guys who have followed in stride with their peers by feeding off their influences.

In series three of the television series Downton Abbey, Lady Cora Grantham mentions Debrett's in jest when defending the choice of her late daughter, Sybil, to have her daughter baptised as Catholic. There was a storyline in Doonesbury where Zonker had a large cash windfall with which he planned to purchase a British peerage. To prepare for his new role, he had a friend quiz him from Debrett's, to great comic effect. In Brideshead Revisited by Evelyn Waugh, Sebastian says to Charles on defending his not letting Charles meet his family when they visit Brideshead the first time together, \\"You don't know what you've been saved. There are lots of us.

John Debrett John Debrett (8 January 1753 – 15 November 1822) was the London-born son of Jean Louys de Bret, a French cook of Huguenot extraction and his wife Rachel Panchaud. As a boy of thirteen, John Debrett was apprenticed to a Piccadilly bookseller and publisher, Robert Davis. He remained there until 1780, when he moved across Piccadilly to work for John Almon, bookseller and stationer. John Almon edited and published his first edition of The New Peerage in 1769, and went on to produce at least three further editions. By 1790 he had passed the editorship on to John Debrett who, in 1802, put his name to the two small volumes that made up The Correct Peerage of England, Scotland and Ireland. Despite twice being declared bankrupt, Debrett continued as a bookseller and editor of the Peerage; the last edition edited by him was the 15th edition, which was published in 1823. He was found dead at his lodgings on 15 November 1822, and was buried at St James's Church, Piccadilly. John Debrett married on 27 April 1787 in Piccadilly to Sophia Granger (1762–1833), daughter of Captain John Granger and Sophia Spencley. They had six children, none of whom followed their father into the book trade although Sophia did work with her husband and at one point ran the business herself.

TEFC enclosed motors usually cost more than open motors, but offer increased protection against weather, dirt, and moisture. TEFC motors are constructed with a small fan on the rear shaft of the motor, covered by a housing. This fan forces air over the motor frame fins, and cools the motor. The enclosure is \\"Totally Enclosed\\". This means that the motor is dust tight, and has a moderate water seal as well. TEFC motors are not secure against high pressure water nor submersible.

It is usually first diagnosed in childhood. Cause Pulmonic stenosis is usually due to isolated valvular obstruction (pulmonary valve stenosis), but it may be due to subvalvular or supravalvular obstruction, such as infundibular stenosis. It may occur in association with other congenital heart defects as part of more complicated syndromes (for example, tetralogy of Fallot). Pathophysiology When pulmonic stenosis (PS) is present, resistance to blood flow causes right ventricular hypertrophy. If right ventricular failure develops, right atrial pressure will increase, and this may result in a persistent opening of the foramen ovale, shunting of unoxygenated blood from the right atrium into the left atrium, and systemic cyanosis. If pulmonary stenosis is severe, congestive heart failure occurs, and systemic venous engorgement will be noted. An associated defect such as a patent ductus arteriosus partially compensates for the obstruction by shunting blood from the left ventricle to the aorta then back to the pulmonary artery (as a result of the higher pressure in the left ventricle) and back into the lungs. Treatment The treatment of choice is percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty and is done when a resting peak gradient is seen to be >60mm Hg or a mean >40mm Hg is observed.

A popular character in Russian literature (celebrated for his riding skills and courage), Dundić was honoured with the Order of the Red Banner.  Biography  = Great Soviet Encyclopedia = According to the Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1972 ed.), he was born into a peasant family, in Grabovac, Dalmatia (now Croatia) on April 13, 1896. Dundić was of Croatian extraction. Entry at academic.ru Entry at education.kulichki.net\\"Dundich, Toma\\", in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd edition, Moscow 1972, Volume 8, page 539, column 1605 His given name was Toma. At the age of 12 he went to South America, where he worked for 4 years as a shepherd in Argentina and Brazil. In 1914 he was recruited as a private in the Austro-Hungarian Army. During the First World War of 1914-1918 in May, 1916 Dundić was taken prisoner by Russian troops near Lutsk. He volunteered to join the First Division of Serbian Volunteer Corps in Russia (Сербский добровольческий корпус). From the middle of 1917, he was a member of the Red Guard (presumably in Odessa). In March, 1918, he headed a guerrilla squad in the region of Bakhmut that later joined the Morozov-Donetsk division, which retreated together with the army of K.E. Voroshilov towards Tsaritsyn in June 1918. He participated in the defence of Tsaritsyn as a member of an international battalion, then with cavalry brigades of Kryuchkovsky and Bulatkin. From 1919, he served in the Special Don Caucasus Division of Semyon Budyonny (later in the cavalry corps and the First Mounted Army). He was deputy regiment commander, special aide to Semyon Budyonny, commander of mounted division at the headquarters of the First Mounted Army. Dundić took part in numerous battles and he was wounded several times. The legendary courage of Dundić brought him ardent love and popularity among Budyonny's troops. From June 1919 he was the deputy commander of the 36th regiment of the 6th cavalry division. He was killed in battle near Rovno, Ukraine, and awarded the Order of the Red Banner.\\"Dundich, Toma\\", in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd edition, Moscow 1972, Volume 8, page 539, column 1605 = Other sources = According to Zelenin and Sumarokova in 1968, the alleged first biography on Dundić, written by B. V. Agatov in October 1920 (original does not exist), allegedly says that he was born in 1894, in Kruševac, then in the Kingdom of Serbia. Allegedly, his family were cattle breeders. After finishing secondary school, he left home and entered a mechanical school. He then lived in the Americas for two years. In 1912-1913, during the Balkan Wars, he was a weapons technician in the Serbian Army. He then served during the First World War, engaging the Austro-German troops, and for his valour shown during the battles on the Danube, he was promoted to second lieutenant. He was wounded twice, and was captured in 1916, the same year he escaped to Russia where he participated in the formation of the Serbian Volunteer Corps. After the February Revolution, he left the Serbian Corps and entered one of the Cossack regiments. After the October Revolution, he sided with the Soviet government and formed and headed an Odessa Red Guard detachment composed of Serb-internationalists. He fought against the Haidamak and cadet bands. He fought in Voronezh on the Don (in 1918), on the Tsaritsyn Front, and was wounded 16 times, then went to the Polish front. He died on July 8, 1920, at Rovno (now Ukraine). However, as Zelenin and Sumarokova declared, Agatov himself did not indicate the source of the accounts relating to Dundić's life prior to joining the First Cavalry, what makes his story quite unreliable in that segment. It might be a mixture of two or more different biographies, melted in one. E.g., if Dundić, as a \\"Serb\\" served in the Austrian army in World War I, he would be a national traitor.Comment by Zelenin and Sumarokova, in Prometei 1968 Legacy In 1958, a joint Yugoslav-Soviet film Aleksa Dundić was directed by Leonid Lukov (). A street in Lviv, Ukraine, was named after him: \\"Oleko Dundich Street\\". A street in Sankt Petersburg (Frunzensky District) was named after him as well (ул. Олеко Дундича). Annotations His given name was Toma Dundić, according to Great Soviet Encyclopedia, Moscow, 1972. \\"Aleksa\\" was his nickname, presumably derived from Spanish \\"Alejo\\" (presumably acquired in Argentina), later in Russian as \\"Олеко\\" (Oleko), and later in Croatian and Serbian as \\"Aleksa\\".

It was developed by Eric Rescorla and Allan M. Schiffman, and published in 1999 as RFC 2660. Web browsers typically use HTTP to communicate with web servers, sending and receiving information without encrypting it. For sensitive transactions, such as Internet e-commerce or online access to financial accounts, the browser and server must encrypt this information. HTTPS and S-HTTP were both defined in the mid-1990s to address this need. S-HTTP was used by Spyglass's web server, while Netscape and Microsoft supported HTTPS rather than S-HTTP, leading to HTTPS becoming the de facto standard mechanism for securing web communications. Comparison to HTTP over TLS S-HTTP encrypts only the served page data and submitted data like POST fields, leaving the initiation of the protocol unchanged. Because of this, S-HTTP could be used concurrently with HTTP (unsecured) on the same port, as the unencrypted header would determine whether the rest of the transmission is encrypted. In contrast, HTTP over TLS wraps the entire communication within Transport Layer Security (TLS; formerly SSL), so the encryption starts before any protocol data is sent. This creates a name-based virtual hosting \\"chicken and egg\\" issue with determining which DNS name was intended for the request. This means that HTTPS implementations without Server Name Indication (SNI) support require a separate IP per DNS name, and all HTTPS implementations require a separate port (usually 443 vs. HTTP's standard 80) for unambiguous use of encryption (treated in most browsers as a separate URI scheme, https://). As documented in RFC 2817, HTTP can also be secured by implementing HTTP/1.1 Upgrade headers and upgrading to TLS. Running HTTP over TLS negotiated in this way, does not have the implications of HTTPS with regards to name-based virtual hosting (no extra IPs, ports, or URI space), however, few implementations support this method. In S-HTTP, the desired URL is not transmitted in the cleartext headers, but left blank; another set of headers is present inside the encrypted payload. In HTTP over TLS, all headers are inside the encrypted payload, and the server application does not generally have the opportunity to gracefully recover from TLS fatal errors (including 'client certificate is untrusted' and 'client certificate is expired').

He was previously the Member of Parliament for Newton—North Delta from 2006 to 2011.  Early life  Born in Punjab, India, Dhaliwal emigrated from India in 1984 and became a Canadian citizen three years later. As a businessman, he co-founded a successful land surveying company and played an important role in the municipal politics of Surrey where he is said to have dominated the Surrey Electors Team membership list by signing up over 2,600 new party members. This represented over half the total number of members. However, in the November 1999 municipal elections, Dhaliwal lost his own bid for a seat on city council.  Federal politics  Dhaliwal was the federal Liberal candidate for the Newton-North Delta riding in 2004, but lost to Conservative Gurmant Grewal by just over 500 votes. Grewal decided to not seek re-election and, in 2006, Dhaliwal faced Conservative newcomer Phil Eidsvik. The NDP was also strong in the riding and 2004 candidate Nancy Clegg also ran again. Dhaliwal succeeded in winning the seat by exactly 1,000 votes. In the 2006 Liberal leadership campaign, Dhaliwal initially indicated support for Joe Volpe, but soon moved to support Michael Ignatieff. Dhaliwal was instrumental in building support for Ignatieff's campaign in the Sikh community. Dhaliwal played a key role in Ignatieff’s short-lived, but successful, second leadership campaign in 2008. In 2008, Dhaliwal wrote to a U.S. District Court judge on official House of Commons stationery in support of convicted international drug trafficker Ranjit Singh Cheema. On October 14, 2008, Dhaliwal was re-elected to Parliament by nearly 2,500 votes. Following the election, Dhaliwal was elected as the Chair of the Northern and Western Caucus of the Official Opposition, and served as the critic for the Asia Pacific Gateway and Western Economic Diversification Canada. Dhaliwal has served on several House of Commons Committees: International Trade; Transportation, Infrastructure and Communities; and Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics. The Ethics Committee attracted high profile attention when it investigated allegations surrounding Karlheinz Schreiber’s dealings with former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Dhaliwal lost his seat to Jinny Sims of the New Democratic Party in the 2011 federal election. On October 15, 2012, Dhaliwal was charged with six counts of tax evasion for failing to file returns for a company that he ran with his wife, Roni Dhaliwal. Two weeks later, the BC Liberal Party announced that Dhaliwal would be their candidate for Surrey-Panorama Ridge in the 2013 BC Election. The seat was held by Stephanie Cadieux, who was moving to Surrey- Cloverdale after incumbent MLA Kevin Falcon announced he was not seeking re- election. After a BC Liberal Party review of his candidacy, however, Dhaliwal withdrew from the election race. He and his wife later pleaded guilty to three and five counts of tax evasion, respectively, and they were ordered to pay a total of $8,000 in fines. In December 2014, Dhaliwal won the Liberal nomination in newly-formed riding of Surrey—Newton ahead of the 2015 election. He defeated NDP incumbent Jinny Sims and won the seat with 56 per cent of the vote.

Early life Weinberg was born on the Lower East Side of New York in 1930. His father, Yitzchak Mattisyahu Weinberg was a Slonimer Hasid, and a grandson of the first Slonimer Rebbe, Avrohom Weinberg.Rabbi Yitzchak Matisyahu Weinberg, came from a chassidic background – he was a Slonimer chassid, and a nephew and grandson of the Slonimer Rebbes His mother, Hinda, was a direct descendant of Jacob ben Jacob Moses of Lissa. Weinberg was the great-great-grandson of Avraham of Slonim. Weinberg studied at Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin in Brooklyn and Yeshivas Ner Yisroel in Baltimore where he received his rabbinic ordination. He completed his undergraduate studies at Johns Hopkins University and his post-graduate studies at Loyola Graduate School. His older brother, Yaakov Weinberg, later became head of Yeshivas Ner Yisroel.  Career  In 1953, Weinberg traveled to Israel to consult with the Chazon Ish regarding the response needed to counter the threat of assimilation in the Jewish world. However, the Chazon Ish died while Weinberg was en route to Israel. Weinberg was a salesman for his brother's company and in the course of his travels to many small cities in the United States he said he discovered Jews of all kinds who were distant from their heritage.The Rosh Yeshivah and the Shliach by Rabbi Avraham Berkowitz on Chabad.org = Aish HaTorah = In 1966, Weinberg decided to enter the field of Orthodox Judaism outreach, and he opened the first yeshiva in this style for Jewish men in Jerusalem. The school was short-lived, as were several other attempts, before he co-founded Yeshivas Shma Yisrael (later renamed Ohr Somayach) in 1970 with Nota Schiller, Mendel Weinbach and Yaakov Rosenberg . After a few years, Weinberg broke away from the partnership over a difference in educational philosophy. He believed that the times called for the call up of \\"kiruv soldiers\\" who would be given a few years of basic education training and then sent out to give introductory classes to other young Jews at risk of assimilation and intermarriage. Weinberg established Aish HaTorah with 5 students in a small apartment in Jerusalem's Old City in 1974.Harris, Ben. \\"Rabbi Noah Weinberg, founder of Aish HaTorah, dies.\\" JTA, February 6, 2009. In addition to its Jerusalem headquarters, Weinberg helped establish an Aish HaTorah branch in St. Louis, Missouri in 1979. The organization later grew to 30 branches worldwide. In 1985, Weinberg launched the Discovery Seminar, a multi-day seminar designed to introduce proofs of God's existence to audiences all over the world. The organization claims that the Discovery Seminar has been presented to over 100,000 people worldwide.Discovery: A Project of Aish International. That same year, Weinberg launched the Jerusalem Fellowships, which brought college age Jewish people to Israel. In 2001, Weinberg founded the Hasbara Fellowships program to bring university students to Israel for an intensive 2 week Israel activism training course. In recognition of Aish HaTorah, the Israeli government awarded Weinberg the last two building sites adjacent to the Western Wall. In 1996 Weinberg dedicated his newly designed yeshiva as the central location for Aish HaTorah's manpower and leadership training programs. Personal life Weinberg married Denah Goldman. They established their first home in the Mea Shearim neighborhood of Jerusalem, and shortly before the Six-Day War in 1967 they moved into a new apartment in the Kiryat Sanz neighborhood.

Cor triatriatum represents 0.1% of all congenital cardiac malformations and may be associated with other cardiac defects in as many as 50% of cases. The membrane may be complete or may contain one or more fenestrations of varying size. Cor triatrium sinistrum is more common. In this defect there is typically a proximal chamber that receives the pulmonic veins and a distal (true) chamber located more anteriorly where it empties into the mitral valve. The membrane that separates the atrium into two parts varies significantly in size and shape. It may appear similar to a diaphragm or be funnel-shaped, bandlike, entirely intact (imperforate) or contain one or more openings (fenestrations) ranging from small, restrictive-type to large and widely open. In the pediatric population, this anomaly may be associated with major congenital cardiac lesions such as tetralogy of Fallot, double outlet right ventricle, coarctation of the aorta, partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection, persistent left superior vena cava with unroofed coronary sinus, ventricular septal defect, atrioventricular septal (endocardial cushion) defect, and common atrioventricular canal. Rarely, asplenia or polysplenia has been reported in these patients. In the adult, cor triatriatum is frequently an isolated finding. Cause Cor triatriatum dextrum is extremely rare and results from the complete persistence of the right sinus valve of the embryonic heart. The membrane divides the right atrium into a proximal (upper) and a distal (lower) chamber. The upper chamber receives the venous blood from both vena cavae and the lower chamber is in contact with the tricuspid valve and the right atrial appendage. Mechanism The natural history of this defect depends on the size of the communicating orifice between the upper and lower atrial chambers. If the communicating orifice is small, the patient is critically ill and may succumb at a young age (usually during infancy) to congestive heart failure and pulmonary edema. If the connection is larger, patients may present in childhood or young adulthood with a clinical picture similar to that of mitral stenosis. Cor triatriatum may also be an incidental finding when it is nonobstructive. Diagnosis by ECHO, possibly followed by MRI. Treatment The disorder can be treated surgically by removing the membrane dividing the atrium. References Church WS. Congenital malformation of heart: abnormal septum in left auricle.

It offers programs from junior kindergarten through high school. It is located in the Meridian Hills neighborhood of Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. A merger of Tudor Hall School for Girls (founded in 1902) and the all-male Park School (founded in 1914) formed the present-day school in 1970. Park Tudor campus in the fall. Foster Hall was named for composer Stephen Foster. History Park Tudor is the product of a merger of two single-sex independent schools, Tudor Hall School for Girls and Park School. Tudor Hall School for Girls was established in 1902 by Fredonia Allen and James Cumming Smith. Allen named the school after her mother, Ann Tudor Allen. The school was originally located at 16th and Meridian streets in Indianapolis. It later moved to a two-building campus at 32nd and Meridian streets where it remained for several decades. In 1960, Tudor Hall moved to the Charles B. Sommers estate on Cold Spring Road, next to Park School. In addition to the day school program, it fostered a significant boarding program. After the 1970 merger with Park School, Tudor Hall was consolidated with Park School into the new College Avenue campus. Park School began in 1914 as The Brooks School for Boys. In 1920, seven Indianapolis businessmen purchased the school to save it from financial problems and renamed it Boys Preparatory School. The school was originally located at 16th Street and Central Avenue before moving to the former Carl Fisher estate on Cold Spring Road which now serves as a portion of Marian University. The name was changed to Park School in 1929 to reflect the park-like atmosphere of the Cold Spring campus. The school finally moved to the current Park Tudor campus at 7200 North College Avenue. Both Park School and Tudor Hall were founded to provide the same college preparatory education as was often found in the eastern states of the United States. The schools each earned a respected national reputation, often earning its graduates automatic admission to many of the country's top-tier colleges and universities. Because the two schools were often geographically located near each other, and as families also often sent their children to both schools, Park School and Tudor Hall developed a close association. Dances, dramatic performances, and other activities were often arranged jointly. During the mid-1960s, Tudor Hall began to eliminate its lower grades while Park School began to admit girls to its Lower School. The two schools then merged in 1970 to form Park-Tudor School at the College Avenue campus. The hyphen was removed from the name by 1981. The property had been donated by Eli Lilly and his brother Josiah K. Lilly Jr. It had previously served as a family retreat and apple orchard known as Lilly Orchard. Apple cider, apples, and other similar products are still sold at the campus each autumn. The campus plan and buildings were largely designed by Indianapolis architect H. Roll McLaughlin. The merged school initially planned to continue Tudor Hall's respected boarding school program. However, citing the diminished enrollment in its program as well as those across the country, the plan was dropped. The school's official crest borrows a crown, which formed Tudor's crest, and a tree on a shield from Park. Likewise, colors for the merged school became red and white. Park's colors had been red and black while Tudor used green and white. The yearbook's name, Chronicle, continued that of Tudor Hall's. The Park School newspaper, The Red and Black, was changed to The Apple Press. Major buildings on the campus include the historic Foster Hall (named after composer Stephen Foster by Foster enthusiast/collector Eli Lilly Jr.), Allen W. Clowes Commons dining hall (1967), Frederic M. Ayres Auditorium (1976), Jane Holton Upper School (1970), Middle School (1988), Lower School (1967), Hilbert Early Education Center (1997), Fine Arts Building (1976), Ruth Lilly Science Center (1989), and the gymnasium complex. Academics Park Tudor’s core curriculum includes studies in English, math, physical education and health, science, social studies, technology and world languages. Students are also offered studies in Spanish, French, Latin, Classical Greek, and Chinese. The Upper School curriculum challenges students with an offering of sixteen Advanced Placement courses and the unique Global Scholars program for highly motivated juniors and seniors. The Global Scholars program was developed by teacher Jan Guffin as a progression from the International Baccalaureate (IB) program, with which he previously had been involved at another school. Global Scholars challenges students in grades 11 and 12 with a Philosophies of Knowing course, independent research, self-assessments, 200 hours of community service and AP exams in five subjects. The culmination of the program is a presentation of a two-year research project with the help of a mentor (often a professional involved with the project topic). Athletics Park Tudor is a member of the Indiana Crossroads Conference. The school fields teams for the Upper School and Middle School in baseball, basketball, cheerleading, crew, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track & field, wrestling and volleyball. The 2010-11 varsity boys basketball team won the IHSAA Class 2A State Finals in March 2011. The team followed with another IHSAA Class 2A State Championship in 2012. On March 29, 2014, Park Tudor School's varsity basketball team won the IHSAA Class 2A State Finals again. The girls soccer team won the soccer program's first state championship in November 2019. Other team state championships include: girls tennis (6), boys tennis (7), ice hockey (7), baseball, girls lacrosse, and boys lacrosse. The Park Tudor boys lacrosse team recorded the only undefeated season in state history on its way to the 2001 state title.

In 1989 she earned a Master's degree in Studio Arts from New York University. She was the 2003 Texas State Artist of the Year. She now resides in Houston. Studio art Dixie Friend has produced art in many different media. Through the years she has produced sculptures, prints, drawings, and paintings. On several occasions she has combined two or more of these in one piece. For example, several of her paintings contain sculptural elements, especially those made before 2003. Paintings made since 2003 lack sculptural components and feature warped landscapes. Of her sculpture, the Chrysalides, haunting hollow fiberglass figures, are the most prominent, reappearing in several forms over the years. Public art In February 2002 Friend completed a commission at George Bush Intercontinental Airport. The installation, “Houston Bayou,” comprises a Byzantine glass mosaic mural on a -long serpentine wall, columns, and the terrazzo floor design. It was selected as one of the best public art installations in the United States by the national organization Americans for the Arts for its \\"Fresh Perspectives / Public Art Year in Review 2002\\". The installation also received \\"Craftsmanship Awards\\" from the Houston and the Regional Chapters of the Construction Specifications Institute in 2002.

If the policyholder were to die while the mortgage life insurance was in force, the policy would pay out a capital sum that will be just sufficient to repay the outstanding mortgage. Mortgage life insurance is supposed to protect the borrower's ability to repay the mortgage for the lifetime of the mortgage. This is in contrast to private mortgage insurance, which is meant to protect the lender against the risk of default on the part of the borrower. The Mechanics When the insurance commences, the value of the insurance coverage must equal the capital outstanding on the repayment mortgage and the policy’s termination date must be the same as the date scheduled for the final payment on the repayment mortgage. The insurance company then calculates the annual rate at which the insurance coverage should decrease in order to mirror the value of the capital outstanding on the repayment mortgage. Even if the client is behind on repayments, the insurance will normally adhere to its original schedule and will not keep up with the outstanding debt. Some mortgage life insurance policies will also pay out if the policyholder is diagnosed with a terminal illness from which the policyholder is expected to die within 12 months of diagnosis. Insurance companies sometimes add other features into their mortgage life insurance policies to reflect conditions in their country’s domestic insurance market and their domestic tax regulations. The Controversy Based on the mechanics of the product, mortgage life insurance is a financial product which paradoxically declines in value as the client-borrower pays more premium to the insurer. In many cases, traditional life insurance (whether term or permanent) can offer a better level of protection for considerably smaller premiums. The biggest advantage of traditional life insurance over mortgage life insurance is that the former maintains its face value throughout the lifetime of the policy, whereas the latter promises to pay out an amount equal to the client's outstanding mortgage debt at any point in time, which is inherently a decreasing sum. Hence, mortgage life insurance is extremely profitable for lenders and/or insurers and equally disadvantageous to borrowers. In addition, lending banks often incentivise borrowers to purchase mortgage life insurance in addition to their new mortgage by means that are on the verge of tied selling practices. Tied selling of a product of self or of an affiliated party, however, is illegal in most jurisdictions. In Canada, for example, this practice is explicitly forbidden by Section 459.1 of the Bank Act (1991).Section 459.1 of the Bank Act from the Department of Justice (Canada), retrieved on June 10, 2011. Finally, mortgage life insurance is not required by law. It is up to the client-borrower whether he or she will opt to protect his or her property investment by an insurance product or not. Similarly, the choice of insurer is completely unrestrained as well. Because of these suboptimal qualities of mortgage life insurance, the product has been subject to sharp criticism by financial experts and by the media across North America for over a decade.Mortgage insurance: Not always a sure thing from CBS Canada, retrieved on June 10, 2011.Does mortgage insurance make sense? from CNNMoney.com, retrieved on June 10, 2011. This has arguably led to fewer banks actively advertising this product in the recent years, although many still keep it in their portfolios. However, many critics fail to consider that in many cases where term life insurance is denied for health reasons, mortgage life insurance is still available (this does not guarantee that you are covered, but rather you're allowed to pay the premium of the insurance, the financial institution holds the right to deny the claim. This is due to \\"post- claim underwriting,\\" meaning they check to see if you qualify for the coverage when you make a claim. This will lead to a refund of premiums and no coverage). As such, mortgage life insurance can cover the biggest expense left by a deceased breadwinner - i.e. housing costs. Thus, it is simplistic to dismiss it out of hand as disadvantageous to borrowers. Other controversies towards this class of products also exist due to the manner leads are created for mortgage protection insurance. Many of these leads pretend to be your bank or lending institution to get you to contact them. They also never state the actual organization that they represent because they are just mortgage protection insurance lead vendors. Private mortgage insurance The term mortgage insurance may in some contexts refer to private mortgage insurance (PMI), also known as lenders mortgage insurance. Private mortgage insurance protects the lender instead of the borrower, although its premiums are payable by the borrower. This type of insurance is compulsory in certain jurisdictions for mortgages started with low down payments. In the United States, subject to Homeowners Protection Act of 1998,Private Mortgage Insurance from Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, retrieved on June 10, 2011. a borrower who provides less than 20% down payment up front may be required to pay for private mortgage insurance until the outstanding mortgage is less than 80% of the value of the property.

Truman (May 8, 1884 – December 26, 1972) was the 33rd president of the United States from 1945 to 1953, succeeding upon the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt after serving as the 34th vice president. He implemented the Marshall Plan to rebuild the economy of Western Europe, and established the Truman Doctrine and NATO. Truman grew up in Independence, Missouri, and during World War I was sent to France as a captain in the Field Artillery. Returning home, he opened a haberdashery in Kansas City, Missouri and was later elected as a Jackson County official in 1922. Truman was elected to the United States Senate from Missouri in 1934 and gained national prominence as chairman of the Truman Committee aimed at reducing waste and inefficiency in wartime contracts. Soon after succeeding to the presidency he authorized the first and only use of nuclear weapons in war. Truman's administration engaged in an internationalist foreign policy and renounced isolationism. He rallied his New Deal coalition during the 1948 presidential election and won a surprise victory that secured his own presidential term. After the onset of the Cold War, Truman oversaw the Berlin Airlift and Marshall Plan in 1948. When North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, he gained United Nations approval to intervene in what became known as the Korean War. On domestic issues, bills endorsed by Truman faced opposition from a conservative Congress, but his administration successfully guided the U.S. economy through the post-war economic challenges. In 1948, he submitted the first comprehensive civil rights legislation and issued Executive Order 9981 to start racial integration in the military and federal agencies. Corruption in the Truman administration became a central campaign issue in the 1952 presidential election. After Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower's electoral victory against Democrat Adlai Stevenson II, Truman went into a financially difficult retirement, marked by the founding of his presidential library and the publication of his memoirs. When he left office, Truman's presidency was criticized, though critical reassessment of his tenure has been favorable. Early life, family, and education Truman was born in Lamar, Missouri, on May 8, 1884, the oldest child of John Anderson Truman and Martha Ellen Young Truman. He was named for his maternal uncle, Harrison \\"Harry\\" Young. His middle name, \\"S\\", honors his grandfathers, Anderson Shipp Truman and Solomon Young. A brother, John Vivian, was born soon after Harry, followed by sister Mary Jane. Truman's ancestry is primarily English with some Scots-Irish, German, and French.. Truman at age 13 in 1897 John Truman was a farmer and livestock dealer. The family lived in Lamar until Harry was ten months old, when they moved to a farm near Harrisonville, Missouri. The family next moved to Belton, and in 1887 to his grandparents' farm in Grandview. When Truman was six, his parents moved to Independence, Missouri, so he could attend the Presbyterian Church Sunday School. He did not attend a traditional school until he was eight. While living in Independence, he served as a Shabbos goy for Jewish neighbors, doing tasks for them on Shabbat that their religion prevented them from doing on that day. Truman was interested in music, reading, and history, all encouraged by his mother, with whom he was very close. As president, he solicited political as well as personal advice from her. He rose at five every morning to practice the piano, which he studied more than twice a week until he was fifteen, becoming quite a skilled player. Truman worked as a page at the 1900 Democratic National Convention in Kansas City; his father had many friends who were active in the Democratic Party and helped young Harry to gain his first political position. After graduating from Independence High School in 1901, Truman enrolled in Spalding's Commercial College, a Kansas City business school. He studied bookkeeping, shorthand, and typing, but left after a year.  Working career  Truman made use of his business college experience to obtain a job as a timekeeper on the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway, sleeping in hobo camps near the rail lines. He then took on a series of clerical jobs, and was employed briefly in the mail room of The Kansas City Star. Truman and his brother Vivian later worked as clerks at the National Bank of Commerce in Kansas City. Truman's home in Independence, Missouri He returned to the Grandview farm in 1906, where he lived until entering the army in 1917. During this period, he courted Bess Wallace. He proposed in 1911, but she turned him down. Truman later said he intended to propose again, but he wanted to have a better income than that earned by a farmer. To that end, during his years on the farm and immediately after World War I, he became active in several business ventures, including a lead and zinc mine near Commerce, Oklahoma, a company that bought land and leased the oil drilling rights to prospectors, and speculation in Kansas City real estate. Truman occasionally derived some income from these enterprises, but none proved successful in the long term. Truman is the only president since William McKinley (elected in 1896) who did not earn a college degree. In addition to having briefly attended business college, from 1923 to 1925 he took night courses toward an LL.B. at the Kansas City Law School (now the University of Missouri–Kansas City School of Law), but dropped out after losing reelection as county judge. He was informed by attorneys in the Kansas City area that his education and experience were probably sufficient to receive a license to practice law. However, he did not pursue it, because he won election as presiding judge. While serving as president in 1947, Truman applied for a license to practice law. A friend who was an attorney began working out the arrangements, and informed Truman that his application had to be notarized. By the time Truman received this information he had changed his mind, so he never sought notarization. After rediscovery of Truman's application, in 1996 the Missouri Supreme Court issued Truman a posthumous honorary law license.  Military service  =National Guard= Because he lacked the funds for college, Truman considered attending the United States Military Academy at West Point, which had no tuition, but he was refused an appointment because of poor eyesight. He enlisted in the Missouri National Guard in 1905, and served until 1911 in the Kansas City-based Battery B, 2nd Missouri Field Artillery Regiment, in which he attained the rank of corporal. At his induction, his eyesight without glasses was an unacceptable 20/50 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left (past the standard for legal blindness). The second time he took the test, he passed by secretly memorizing the eye chart. He was described as 5 feet 10 inches tall, gray eyed, dark haired and of light complexion. ca. 1918 =World War I= When the United States entered World War I, Truman rejoined Battery B, successfully recruiting new soldiers for the expanding unit, for which he was elected as their first lieutenant. Before deployment to France, Truman was sent for training to Camp Doniphan, Fort Sill, near Lawton, Oklahoma when his regiment was federalized as the 129th Field Artillery. The regimental commander during its training was Robert M. Danford, who later served as the Army's Chief of Field Artillery. Truman later said he learned more practical, useful information from Danford in six weeks than from six months of formal Army instruction, and when Truman later served as an artillery instructor, he consciously patterned his approach on Danford's. Truman also ran the camp canteen with Edward Jacobson, a clothing store clerk he knew from Kansas City. Unlike most canteens funded by unit members, which usually lost money, the canteen operated by Truman and Jacobson turned a profit, returning each soldier's initial $2 investment and $10,000 in dividends in six months. At Fort Sill, Truman met Lieutenant James M. Pendergast, nephew of Tom Pendergast, a Kansas City political boss, a connection which had a profound influence on Truman's later life. In mid-1918, about one million soldiers of the American Expeditionary Forces were in France. Truman was promoted to captain effective April 23,Announcement of Harry S. Truman's Promotion to Captain, May 2, 1918 and in July became commander of the newly arrived Battery D, 129th Field Artillery, 35th Division.\\"Truman's Battery\\" Battery D was known for its discipline problems, and Truman was initially unpopular because of his efforts to restore order. Despite attempts by the men to intimidate him into quitting, Truman succeeded by making his corporals and sergeants accountable for discipline. He promised to back them up if they performed capably, and reduce them to private if they did not. In an event memorialized in battery lore as \\"The Battle of Who Run\\", his soldiers began to flee during a sudden night attack by the Germans in the Vosges Mountains; Truman succeeded at ordering his men to stay and fight, using profanity from his railroad days. The men were so surprised to hear Truman use such language that they immediately obeyed. Truman's unit joined in a massive prearranged assault barrage on September 26, 1918, at the opening of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. They advanced with difficulty over pitted terrain to follow the infantry, and set up an observation post west of Cheppy. On September 27, Truman saw through his binoculars an enemy artillery battery setting up across a river in a position allowing them to fire upon the neighboring 28th Division. Truman's orders limited him to targets facing the 35th Division, but he ignored this and patiently waited until the Germans had walked their horses well away from their guns, ensuring they could not relocate out of range of Truman's battery. He then ordered his men to open fire, and their attack destroyed the enemy battery. His actions were credited with saving the lives of 28th Division soldiers who otherwise would have come under fire from the Germans. Truman was given a dressing down by his regimental commander, Colonel Karl D. Klemm, who threatened to convene a court-martial, but Klemm never followed through, and Truman was not punished. In other action during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, Truman's battery provided support for George S. Patton's tank brigade, and fired some of the last shots of the war on November 11, 1918. Battery D did not lose any men while under Truman's command in France. To show their appreciation of his leadership, his men presented him with a large loving cup upon their return to the United States after the war. The war was a transformative experience in which Truman manifested his leadership qualities. He had entered the service in 1917 as a family farmer who had worked in clerical jobs that did not require the ability to motivate and direct others, but during the war he gained leadership experience and a record of success that greatly enhanced and supported his post-war political career in Missouri. Truman was brought up in the Presbyterian and Baptist churches, but avoided revivals and sometimes ridiculed revivalist preachers. He rarely spoke about religion, which to him, primarily meant ethical behavior along traditional Protestant lines. Most of the soldiers he commanded in the war were Catholics, and one of his close friends was the 129th Field Artillery's chaplain, Monsignor L. Curtis Tiernan. The two remained friends until Tiernan's death in 1960. Developing leadership and interpersonal skills that later made him a successful politician helped Truman get along with his Catholic soldiers, as he did with soldiers of other Christian denominations and the unit's Jewish members... = Officers' Reserve Corps = Truman was honorably discharged from the Army as a captain on May 6, 1919. In 1920 he was appointed a major in the Officers Reserve Corps. He became a lieutenant colonel in 1925 and a colonel in 1932. In the 1920s and 1930s he commanded 1st Battalion, 379th Field Artillery, 102d Infantry Division. After promotion to colonel, Truman advanced to command of the same regiment. After his election to the U.S. Senate, Truman was transferred to the General Assignments Group, a holding unit for less active officers, although he had not been consulted in advance.Army History: Truman, you're too old Truman protested his reassignment, which led to his resumption of regimental command. He remained an active reservist until the early 1940s. Truman volunteered for active military service during World War II, but was not accepted, partly because of age, and partly because President Franklin D. Roosevelt desired Senators and Congressman who belonged to the military reserves to support the war effort by remaining in Congress, or by ending their active duty service and resuming their Congressional seats. He was an inactive reservist from the early 1940s until retiring as a colonel in the then redesignated U.S. Army Reserve on January 20, 1953.Pullen, Twice the Citizen = Military awards and decorations = Truman was awarded a World War I Victory Medal with two battle clasps (for St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne) and a Defensive Sector Clasp. He was also the recipient of two Armed Forces Reserve Medals.  Politics  = Jackson County judge = Harry and Bess Truman on their wedding day, After his wartime service, Truman returned to Independence, where he married Bess Wallace on June 28, 1919. The couple had one child, Mary Margaret Truman. Shortly before the wedding, Truman and Jacobson opened a haberdashery together at 104 West 12th Street in downtown Kansas City. After brief initial success, the store went bankrupt during the recession of 1921. Truman did not pay off the last of the debts from that venture until 1935, when he did so with the aid of banker William T. Kemper, who worked behind the scenes to enable Truman's brother Vivian to buy Truman's $5,600 promissory note during the asset sale of a bank that had failed in the Great Depression. The note had risen and fallen in value as it was bought and sold, interest accumulated and Truman made payments, so by the time the last bank to hold it failed, it was worth nearly $9,000. Thanks to Kemper's efforts, Vivian Truman was able to buy it for $1,000. Jacobson and Truman remained close friends even after their store failed, and Jacobson's advice to Truman on Zionism later played a role in the U.S. Government's decision to recognize Israel. With the help of the Kansas City Democratic machine led by Tom Pendergast, Truman was elected in 1922 as County Court judge of Jackson County's eastern district—Jackson County's three-judge court included judges from the western district (Kansas City), the eastern district (the county outside Kansas City), and a presiding judge elected countywide. This was an administrative rather than a judicial court, similar to county commissioners in many other jurisdictions. Truman lost his 1924 reelection campaign in a Republican wave led by President Calvin Coolidge's landslide election to a full term. Two years selling automobile club memberships convinced him that a public service career was safer for a family man approaching middle age, and he planned a run for presiding judge in 1926. Truman won the job in 1926 with the support of the Pendergast machine, and he was re-elected in 1930. As presiding judge, Truman helped coordinate the Ten Year Plan, which transformed Jackson County and the Kansas City skyline with new public works projects, including an extensive series of roads and construction of a new Wight and Wight-designed County Court building. Also in 1926, he became president of the National Old Trails Road Association. He oversaw the dedication in the late 1920s of a series of Madonna of the Trail monuments honoring 12 pioneer women. In 1933, Truman was named Missouri's director for the Federal Re-Employment program (part of the Civil Works Administration) at the request of Postmaster General James Farley. This was payback to Pendergast for delivering the Kansas City vote to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. The appointment confirmed Pendergast's control over federal patronage jobs in Missouri and marked the zenith of his power. It also created a relationship between Truman and Roosevelt's aide Harry Hopkins and assured Truman's avid support for the New Deal. = U.S. Senator from Missouri = Drawer from the Senate desk used by Truman After serving as a county judge, Truman wanted to run for Governor or Congress, but Pendergast rejected these ideas. Truman then thought he might serve out his career in some well-paying county sinecure; circumstances changed when Pendergast reluctantly backed him as the machine's choice in the 1934 Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate from Missouri, after Pendergast's first four choices had declined to run. In the primary, Truman defeated Congressmen John J. Cochran and Jacob L. Milligan with the solid support of Jackson County, which was crucial to his candidacy. Also critical were the contacts he had made statewide in his capacity as a county official, member of the Masons, military reservist, and member of the American Legion. In the general election, Truman defeated incumbent Republican Roscoe C. Patterson by nearly 20 percentage points in a continuing wave of pro-New Deal Democrats elected following the Great Depression. Results of the 1934 U.S. Senate election in Missouri; Truman won the counties in blue Truman assumed office with a reputation as \\"the Senator from Pendergast\\". He referred patronage decisions to Pendergast, but maintained that he voted with his own conscience. He later defended the patronage decisions by saying that \\"by offering a little to the machine, [he] saved a lot\\". In his first term, Truman spoke out against corporate greed and the dangers of Wall Street speculators and other moneyed special interests attaining too much influence in national affairs. Though he served on the high-profile Appropriations and Interstate Commerce Committees, he was largely ignored by President Roosevelt and had trouble getting calls returned from the White House. During the U.S. Senate election in 1940, United States Attorney Maurice Milligan (former opponent Jacob Milligan's brother) and former governor Lloyd Stark both challenged Truman in the Democratic primary. Truman was politically weakened by Pendergast's imprisonment for income tax evasion the previous year; the senator had remained loyal, having claimed that Republican judges (not the Roosevelt administration) were responsible for the boss's downfall. St. Louis party leader Robert E. Hannegan's support of Truman proved crucial; he later brokered the deal that put Truman on the national ticket. In the end, Stark and Milligan split the anti-Pendergast vote in the Senate Democratic primary and Truman won by a total of 8,000 votes. In the November election, Truman defeated Republican Manvel H. Davis by 51–49 percent. As Senator, Truman opposed both Nazi Germany and Communist Russia. One week after Hitler invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, he said: Truman Committee In late 1940, Truman traveled to various military bases. The waste and profiteering he saw led him to use his chairmanship of the Committee on Military Affairs Subcommittee on War Mobilization to start investigations into abuses while the nation prepared for war. A new special committee was set up under Truman to conduct a formal investigation; the Roosevelt administration supported this plan rather than weather a more hostile probe by the House of Representatives. The main mission of the committee was to expose and fight waste and corruption in the gigantic government wartime contracts. Truman's initiative convinced Senate leaders of the necessity for the committee, which reflected his demands for honest and efficient administration and his distrust of big business and Wall Street. Truman managed the committee \\"with extraordinary skill\\" and usually achieved consensus, generating heavy media publicity that gave him a national reputation. Activities of the Truman Committee ranged from criticizing the \\"dollar-a-year men\\" hired by the government, many of whom proved ineffective, to investigating a shoddily built New Jersey housing project for war workers.. The committee reportedly saved as much as $15 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ), and its activities put Truman on the cover of Time magazine. According to the Senate's historical minutes, in leading the committee, \\"Truman erased his earlier public image as an errand- runner for Kansas City politicos\\", and \\"no senator ever gained greater political benefits from chairing a special investigating committee than did Missouri's Harry S. Truman.\\"  Vice Presidency (1945)  Roosevelt's advisors knew that Roosevelt might not live out a fourth term, and that his vice president would very likely become the next president. Henry Wallace had served as Roosevelt's vice president for four years and was popular among Democratic voters, but he was viewed as too far to the left and too friendly to labor for some of Roosevelt's advisers. The President and several of his confidantes wanted to replace Wallace with someone more acceptable to Democratic Party leaders. Outgoing Democratic National Committee chairman Frank C. Walker, incoming chairman Hannegan, party treasurer Edwin W. Pauley, Bronx party boss Ed Flynn, Chicago Mayor Edward Joseph Kelly, and lobbyist George E. Allen all wanted to keep Wallace off the ticket. Roosevelt told party leaders that he would accept either Truman or Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas. State and city party leaders strongly preferred Truman, and Roosevelt agreed. Truman did not campaign for the vice-presidential spot, though he welcomed the attention as evidence that he had become more than the \\"Senator from Pendergast\\". Truman's nomination was dubbed the \\"Second Missouri Compromise\\" and was well received. The Roosevelt–Truman ticket achieved a 432–99 electoral-vote victory in the election, defeating the Republican ticket of Governor Thomas E. Dewey of New York and running mate Governor John Bricker of Ohio. Truman was sworn in as vice president on January 20, 1945. Truman's brief vice-presidency was relatively uneventful. On April 10, 1945,Occasions When Vice Presidents Have Voted to Break Tie Votes in the Senate, Senate Historical Office, United States Senate, p. 7. Truman cast his only tie- breaking vote as president of the Senate, against a Robert A. Taft amendment that would have blocked the postwar delivery of Lend-Lease Act items contracted for during the war.Harold Foote Gosnell, Truman's Crises: A Political Biography of Harry S. Truman (Greenwood Press, 1980), p. 212: \\"On only one occasion did [Truman] break a tie, and this was when his negative vote defeated a Taft amendment to the Lend-Lease Act which would have prevented postwar delivery of lend-lease goods contracted for during the war.\\"Robert C. Byrd, Senate, 1789–1989, Vol. 1: Addresses on the History of the United States Senate (Government Printing Office, 1988), p. 534: \\"In his eighty-two days as vice president, he had the opportunity to vote only once-- on an amendment to limit the Lend-Lease extension bill. The vote was tied, and Truman voted no, which, in a sense, was unnecessary since the bill would have died even without his vote.\\" Roosevelt rarely contacted him, even to inform him of major decisions; the president and vice president met alone together only twice during their time in office. In one of his first acts as vice president, Truman created some controversy when he attended the disgraced Pendergast's funeral. He brushed aside the criticism, saying simply, \\"He was always my friend and I have always been his.\\" He had rarely discussed world affairs or domestic politics with Roosevelt; he was uninformed about major initiatives relating to the war and the top-secret Manhattan Project, which was about to test the world's first atomic bomb. In an event that generated negative publicity for Truman, he was photographed with actress Lauren Bacall sitting atop the piano at the National Press Club as he played for soldiers. Truman had been vice president for 82 days when President Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945. Truman, presiding over the Senate as usual, had just adjourned the session for the day and was preparing to have a drink in House Speaker Sam Rayburn's office when he received an urgent message to go immediately to the White House, where Eleanor Roosevelt told him that her husband had died after a massive cerebral hemorrhage. Truman asked her if there was anything he could do for her; she replied, \\"Is there anything we can do for you? For you are the one in trouble now!\\" He was sworn in as president at 7:09 pm in the West Wing of the White House, by Chief Justice Harlan F. Stone.Paul Ham, Hiroshima Nagasaki, p. 68  Presidency (1945–1953)  Truman surrounded himself with his old friends, and appointed several to high positions that seemed well beyond their competence, including his two secretaries of the treasury, Fred Vinson and John Snyder. His closest friend in the White House was his military aide Harry H. Vaughan, who was criticized for trading access to the White House for expensive gifts. Truman loved to spend as much time as possible playing poker, telling stories and sipping bourbon. Alonzo Hamby notes that: = First term (1945–1949) =  Assuming office and the atomic bomb  Joseph Stalin, Harry S. Truman, and Winston Churchill in Potsdam, July 1945 Shortly after taking the oath of office, Truman spoke to reporters: \\"Boys, if you ever pray, pray for me now. I don't know if you fellas ever had a load of hay fall on you, but when they told me what happened yesterday, I felt like the moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on me.\\" Upon assuming the presidency, Truman asked all the members of Roosevelt's cabinet to remain in place, and told them he was open to their advice. He emphasized a central principle of his administration: he would be the one making decisions, and they were to support him. Although Truman was told briefly on the afternoon of April 12 that the Allies had a new, highly destructive weapon, it was not until April 25 that Secretary of War Henry Stimson told him the details. Truman benefited from a honeymoon period after Roosevelt's death, and from the Allies' success in Europe, ending the war against Nazi Germany. Truman was pleased to issue the proclamation of V-E Day on May 8, 1945, his 61st birthday. In the wake of Allied victory, Truman journeyed to Europe for the Potsdam Conference. He was there when he learned the Trinity test—the first atomic bomb—on July 16 had been successful. He hinted to Joseph Stalin that the United States was about to use a new kind of weapon against the Japanese. Though this was the first time the Soviets had been officially given information about the atomic bomb, Stalin was already aware of the bomb project—having learned about it through atomic espionage long before Truman did. In August, the Japanese government refused surrender demands as specifically outlined in the Potsdam Declaration. With the invasion of Japan imminent, Truman approved the schedule for dropping the two available bombs. Truman always said attacking Japan with atomic bombs saved many lives on both sides; military estimates for the invasion of Japan were that it could take a year and result in 250,000 to 500,000 U.S. casualties. Hiroshima was bombed on August 6, and Nagasaki three days later, leaving 105,000 dead. The Soviet Union declared war on Japan on August 9 and invaded Manchuria. Japan agreed to surrender the following day. Truman announces Japan's surrender, August 14, 1945 Supporters of Truman's decision argue that, given the tenacious Japanese defense of the outlying islands, the bombings saved hundreds of thousands of lives of prisoners, civilians, and combatants on both sides that would have been lost in an invasion of Japan. Critics have argued that the use of nuclear weapons was unnecessary, given that conventional attacks or a demonstrative bombing of an uninhabited area would have forced Japan's surrender and therefore assert that the attack constituted a crime of war.. Truman defended his decision to use atomic bombs during the war: Truman continued to strongly defend himself in his memoirs in 1955–1956, stating many lives could have been lost had the United States invaded mainland Japan without the atomic bombs. In 1963, he stood by his decision, telling a journalist \\"it was done to save 125,000 youngsters on the U.S. side and 125,000 on the Japanese side from getting killed and that is what it did. It probably also saved a half million youngsters on both sides from being maimed for life.\\"  Strikes and economic upheaval  The end of World War II was followed by an uneasy transition from war to a peacetime economy. The costs of the war effort had been enormous, and Truman was intent on diminishing military services as quickly as possible to curtail the government's military expenditures. The effect of demobilization on the economy was unknown, proposals were met with skepticism and resistance, and fears existed that the nation would slide back into depression. In Roosevelt's final years, Congress began to reassert legislative power and Truman faced a congressional body where Republicans and conservative southern Democrats formed a powerful voting bloc. Dormant stressors during the war emerged as polarizing issues under Truman's administration. Strikes and labor-management conflicts destabilized major industries while severe housing and consumer good shortages added to public stress over inflation which peaked at six percent in a single month. Truman's response to the widespread dissatisfaction and protest of U.S. citizens was generally seen as ineffective. The cost of consumer goods increased rapidly due to the removal of depression-era limits on the prices of everyday items while producers of the remaining price-controlled commodities struggled due to the artificially low prices of their goods. In 1945 and 1946, farmers refused to sell grain for months even though it was desperately needed in the United States and to stave off starvation in Europe. Similarly, industrial laborers sought wage increases. In January 1946 a steel strike involving 800,000 laborers became the largest in the nation's history. It was followed by a coal strike in April and a rail strike in May; however, public opinion on labor action was mixed with one poll reporting a majority of the public in favor of a ban on strikes by public service workers and a year's moratorium on labor actions. Truman with Greek-American sponge divers in Florida, 1947 When a national rail strike threatened in May 1946, Truman seized the railroads in an attempt to contain the issue, but two key railway unions struck anyway. The entire national railroad system was shut down, immobilizing 24,000 freight trains and 175,000 passenger trains a day. For two days, public anger mounted and Truman himself drafted an irate message to Congress that called on veterans to form a lynch mob and destroy the union leaders: His staff was stunned, but top aide Clark Clifford revised the original draft and Truman delivered a toned down version of the speech to Congress. Truman called for a new law, where any railroad strikers would be drafted into the army. As he concluded his congressional address, he received a message that the strike had been settled on presidential terms; nevertheless, a few hours later, the House voted to draft the strikers. Taft killed the bill in the Senate. After the settlement of the railway strike, labor action continued as an undercurrent of Truman's presidency. The president's approval rating dropped from 82 percent in the polls in January 1946 to 52 percent by June. This dissatisfaction with the Truman administration's policies led to large Democratic losses in the 1946 midterm elections, and Republicans took control of Congress for the first time since 1930. The 80th Congress included Republican freshmen who would become prominent in U.S. politics in the years to come including Wisconsin Senator Joe McCarthy and California Congressman Richard Nixon. When Truman dropped to 32 percent in the polls, Democratic Arkansas Senator William Fulbright suggested that Truman resign; the president said he did not care what Senator \\"Halfbright\\" said. Truman cooperated closely with the Republican leaders on foreign policy, but fought them bitterly on domestic issues. The power of the labor unions was significantly curtailed by the Taft–Hartley Act which was enacted over Truman's veto. Truman twice vetoed bills to lower income tax rates in 1947. Although the initial vetoes were sustained, Congress overrode his veto of a tax cut bill in 1948. In one notable instance of bipartisanship, Congress passed the Presidential Succession Act of 1947, which replaced the secretary of state with the Speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate as successor to the president after the vice president. As he readied for the 1948 election, Truman made clear his identity as a Democrat in the New Deal tradition, advocating for national health insurance,. and repeal of the Taft–Hartley Act. He broke with the New Deal by initiating an aggressive civil rights program which he termed a moral priority. His economic and social vision constituted a broad legislative agenda that came to be called the \\"Fair Deal.\\" Truman's proposals were not well received by Congress, even with renewed Democratic majorities in Congress after 1948. The Solid South rejected civil rights as those states still enforced segregation. Only one of the major Fair Deal bills, the Housing Act of 1949, was ever enacted.. Many of the New Deal programs that persisted during Truman's presidency have since received minor improvements and extensions.  Marshall Plan, Cold War, and China  Truman's press secretary was his old friend Charles Griffith Ross. He had great integrity but, says Alonzo L. Hamby, as a senior White House aide he was, \\"A better newsman than news handler, he never established a policy of coordinating news releases throughout the executive branch, frequently bumbled details, never developed ... a strategy for marketing the president's image and failed to establish a strong press office.\\" As a Wilsonian internationalist, Truman supported Roosevelt's policy in favor of the creation of the United Nations and included Eleanor Roosevelt on the delegation to the UN's first General Assembly. With the Soviet Union expanding its sphere of influence through Eastern Europe, Truman and his foreign policy advisors took a hard line against the USSR. In this, he matched U.S. public opinion which quickly came to believe the Soviets were intent upon world domination. Although he had little personal expertise on foreign matters, Truman listened closely to his top advisors, especially George Marshall and Dean Acheson. The Republicans controlled Congress in 1947–1948, so he worked with their leaders, especially Senator Arthur H. Vandenburg, chairman of the powerful Foreign Relations Committee.James M. McCormick, and Eugene R. Wittkopf. \\"Bipartisanship, partisanship, and ideology in congressional-executive foreign policy relations, 1947–1988.\\" Journal of Politics 52.4 (1990): 1077–1100. He won bipartisan support for both the Truman Doctrine, which formalized a policy of Soviet containment, and the Marshall Plan, which aimed to help rebuild postwar Europe. To get Congress to spend the vast sums necessary to restart the moribund European economy, Truman used an ideological argument, arguing that communism flourishes in economically deprived areas. As part of the U.S. Cold War strategy, Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947 and reorganized military forces by merging the Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (later the Department of Defense) and creating the U.S. Air Force. The act also created the CIA and the National Security Council. In 1952, Truman secretly consolidated and empowered the cryptologic elements of the United States by creating the National Security Agency (NSA). Truman did not know what to do about China, where the Nationalists and Communists were fighting a large-scale civil war. The Nationalists had been major wartime allies and had large-scale popular support in the United States, along with a powerful lobby. General George Marshall spent most of 1946 in China trying to negotiate a compromise, but failed. He convinced Truman the Nationalists would never win on their own and a very large-scale U.S. intervention to stop the Communists would significantly weaken U.S. opposition to the Soviets in Europe. By 1949, the Communists under Mao Zedong had won the civil war, the United States had a new enemy in Asia, and Truman came under fire from conservatives for \\"losing\\" China.May, Ernest R. (2002) \\"1947–48: When Marshall Kept the U.S. out of War in China.\\" Journal of Military History 66#4: 1001–1010. online  Berlin airlift  On June 24, 1948, the Soviet Union blocked access to the three Western-held sectors of Berlin. The Allies had not negotiated a deal to guarantee supply of the sectors deep within the Soviet-occupied zone. The commander of the U.S. occupation zone in Germany, General Lucius D. Clay, proposed sending a large armored column across the Soviet zone to West Berlin with instructions to defend itself if it were stopped or attacked. Truman believed this would entail an unacceptable risk of war. He approved Ernest Bevin's plan to supply the blockaded city by air. On June 25, the Allies initiated the Berlin Airlift, a campaign to deliver food, coal and other supplies using military aircraft on a massive scale. Nothing like it had ever been attempted before, and no single nation had the capability, either logistically or materially, to accomplish it. The airlift worked; ground access was again granted on May 11, 1949. Nevertheless, the airlift continued for several months after that. The Berlin Airlift was one of Truman's great foreign policy successes; it significantly aided his election campaign in 1948.  Recognition of Israel  Truman in the Oval Office, receiving a Hanukkah Menorah from the prime minister of Israel, David Ben-Gurion (center). To the right is Abba Eban, ambassador of Israel to the United States Truman had long taken an interest in the history of the Middle East, and was sympathetic to Jews who sought to re- establish their ancient homeland in Mandatory Palestine. As a senator, he announced support for Zionism; in 1943 he called for a homeland for those Jews who survived the Nazi regime. However, State Department officials were reluctant to offend the Arabs, who were opposed to the establishment of a Jewish state in the large region long populated and dominated culturally by Arabs. Secretary of Defense James Forrestal warned Truman of the importance of Saudi Arabian oil in another war; Truman replied he would decide his policy on the basis of justice, not oil. U.S. diplomats with experience in the region were opposed, but Truman told them he had few Arabs among his constituents. Palestine was secondary to the goal of protecting the \\"Northern Tier\\" of Greece, Turkey, and Iran from communism, as promised by the Truman Doctrine. Weary of both the convoluted politics of the Middle East and pressure by Jewish leaders, Truman was undecided on his policy, and skeptical about how the Jewish \\"underdogs\\" would handle power.Baylis, Thomas. How Israel was Won: A Concise History of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, p. 55 (Lexington Books, Rowman and Littlefield, 1999).Holmes, David. The Faiths of the Postwar Presidents: From Truman to Obama, pp. 16–17. (U. Georgia Press, 2012). He later cited as decisive in his recognition of the Jewish state the advice of his former business partner, Eddie Jacobson, a non-religious Jew whom Truman absolutely trusted. Truman decided to recognize Israel over the objections of Secretary of State George Marshall, who feared it would hurt relations with the populous Arab states. Marshall believed the paramount threat to the United States was the Soviet Union and feared Arab oil would be lost to the United States in the event of war; he warned Truman the United States was \\"playing with fire with nothing to put it out\\". Truman recognized the State of Israel on May 14, 1948, eleven minutes after it declared itself a nation. Of his decision to recognize the Israeli state, Truman wrote in his memoirs: \\"Hitler had been murdering Jews right and left. I saw it, and I dream about it even to this day. The Jews needed some place where they could go. It is my attitude that the American government couldn't stand idly by while the victims [of] Hitler's madness are not allowed to build new lives.\\" = 1948 election = Dewey during a campaign tour in New York The 1948 presidential election is remembered for Truman's stunning come-from-behind victory. In the spring of 1948, Truman's public approval rating stood at 36 percent, and the president was nearly universally regarded as incapable of winning the general election. The \\"New Deal\\" operatives within the party—including FDR's son, James Roosevelt—tried to swing the Democratic nomination to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, a highly popular figure whose political views and party affiliation were totally unknown. Eisenhower emphatically refused to accept, and Truman outflanked opponents to his own nomination. At the 1948 Democratic National Convention, Truman attempted to unify the party with a vague civil rights plank in the party platform. His intention was to assuage the internal conflicts between the northern and southern wings of his party. Events overtook his efforts. A sharp address given by Mayor Hubert Humphrey of Minneapolis—as well as the local political interests of a number of urban bosses—convinced the convention to adopt a stronger civil rights plank, which Truman approved wholeheartedly. All of Alabama's delegates, and a portion of Mississippi's, walked out of the convention in protest. Unfazed, Truman delivered an aggressive acceptance speech attacking the 80th Congress, which Truman called the \\"Do Nothing Congress,\\" and promising to win the election and \\"make these Republicans like it.\\" Within two weeks of the 1948 convention Truman issued Executive Order 9981, racially integrating the U.S. Armed Services and Executive Order 9980 to integrate federal agencies. Truman took a considerable political risk in backing civil rights, and many seasoned Democrats were concerned the loss of Dixiecrat support might destroy the Democratic Party. South Carolina Governor Strom Thurmond, a segregationist, declared his candidacy for the presidency on a Dixiecrat ticket and led a full-scale revolt of Southern \\"states' rights\\" proponents. This rebellion on the right was matched by one on the left, led by Wallace on the Progressive Party ticket. Immediately after its first post-FDR convention, the Democratic Party seemed to be disintegrating. Victory in November seemed unlikely as the party was not simply split but divided three ways. For his running mate, Truman accepted Kentucky Senator Alben W. Barkley, though he really wanted Justice William O. Douglas, who turned down the nomination. Truman's political advisors described the political scene as \\"one unholy, confusing cacophony.\\" They told Truman to speak directly to the people, in a personal way. Campaign manager William J. Bray said Truman took this advice, and spoke personally and passionately, sometimes even setting aside his notes to talk to Americans \\"of everything that is in my heart and soul.\\" The campaign was a presidential odyssey. In a personal appeal to the nation, Truman crisscrossed the United States by train; his \\"whistle stop\\" speeches from the rear platform of the observation car, Ferdinand Magellan, came to represent his campaign. His combative appearances captured the popular imagination and drew huge crowds. Six stops in Michigan drew a combined half- million people; a full million turned out for a New York City ticker-tape parade. 1948 electoral vote results Truman was so widely expected to lose the 1948 election that the Chicago Tribune had printed papers with this erroneous headline when few returns were in. The large, mostly spontaneous gatherings at Truman's whistle-stop events were an important sign of a change in momentum in the campaign, but this shift went virtually unnoticed by the national press corps. It continued reporting Republican Thomas Dewey's apparent impending victory as a certainty. One reason for the press's inaccurate projection was that polls were conducted primarily by telephone, but many people, including much of Truman's populist base, did not yet own a telephone. This skewed the data to indicate a stronger support base for Dewey than existed. An unintended and undetected projection error may have contributed to the perception of Truman's bleak chances. The three major polling organizations stopped polling well before the November 2 election date—Roper in September, and Crossley and Gallup in October—thus failing to measure the period when Truman appears to have surged past Dewey. In the end, Truman held his progressive Midwestern base, won most of the Southern states despite the civil rights plank, and squeaked through with narrow victories in a few critical states, notably Ohio, California, and Illinois. The final tally showed the president had secured 303 electoral votes, Dewey 189, and Thurmond only 39. Henry Wallace got none. The defining image of the campaign came after Election Day, when an ecstatic Truman held aloft the erroneous front page of the Chicago Tribune with a huge headline proclaiming \\"Dewey Defeats Truman.\\" = Full elected term (1949–1953) = Truman's second inauguration was the first ever televised nationally.  Hydrogen bomb decision  The Soviet Union's atomic bomb project progressed much faster than had been expected, and they detonated their first bomb on August 29, 1949. Over the next several months there was an intense debate that split U.S. government, military, and scientific communities regarding whether to proceed with development of the far more powerful hydrogen bomb. The debate touched on matters from technical feasibility to strategic value to the morality of creating a massively destructive weapon. On January 31, 1950, Truman made the decision to go forward on the grounds that if the Soviets could make an H-bomb, the United States must do so as well and stay ahead in the nuclear arms race. The development achieved fruition with the first U.S. H-bomb test on October 31, 1952, which was officially announced by Truman on January 7, 1953.  Korean War  President Truman signing a proclamation declaring a national emergency and authorizing U.S. entry into the Korean War On June 25, 1950, the North Korean army under Kim Il-sung invaded South Korea, starting the Korean War. In the early weeks of the war, the North Koreans easily pushed back their southern counterparts. Truman called for a naval blockade of Korea, only to learn that due to budget cutbacks, the U.S. Navy could not enforce such a measure. Truman promptly urged the United Nations to intervene; it did, authorizing troops under the UN flag led by U.S. General Douglas MacArthur. Truman decided he did not need formal authorization from Congress, believing that most legislators supported his position; this would come back to haunt him later, when the stalemated conflict was dubbed \\"Mr. Truman's War\\" by legislators. However, on July 3, 1950, Truman did give Senate Majority Leader Scott W. Lucas a draft resolution titled \\"Joint Resolution Expressing Approval of the Action Taken in Korea\\". Lucas stated Congress supported the use of force, the formal resolution would pass but was unnecessary, and consensus in Congress was to acquiesce. Truman responded he did not want \\"to appear to be trying to get around Congress and use extra- Constitutional powers,\\" and added that it was \\"up to Congress whether such a resolution should be introduced.\\". By August 1950, U.S. troops pouring into South Korea under UN auspices were able to stabilize the situation. Responding to criticism over readiness, Truman fired his secretary of defense, Louis A. Johnson, replacing him with the retired General Marshall. With UN approval, Truman decided on a \\"rollback\\" policy—conquest of North Korea. UN forces led by General Douglas MacArthur led the counterattack, scoring a stunning surprise victory with an amphibious landing at the Battle of Inchon that nearly trapped the invaders. UN forces marched north, toward the Yalu River boundary with China, with the goal of reuniting Korea under UN auspices. However, China surprised the UN forces with a large-scale invasion in November. The UN forces were forced back to below the 38th parallel, then recovered. By early 1951 the war became a fierce stalemate at about the 38th parallel where it had begun. Truman rejected MacArthur's request to attack Chinese supply bases north of the Yalu, but MacArthur promoted his plan to Republican house leader Joseph Martin, who leaked it to the press. Truman was gravely concerned further escalation of the war might lead to open conflict with the Soviet Union, which was already supplying weapons and providing warplanes (with Korean markings and Soviet aircrew). Therefore, on April 11, 1951, Truman fired MacArthur from his commands. The dismissal of General Douglas MacArthur was among the least politically popular decisions in presidential history. Truman's approval ratings plummeted, and he faced calls for his impeachment from, among others, Senator Robert A. Taft. Fierce criticism from virtually all quarters accused Truman of refusing to shoulder the blame for a war gone sour and blaming his generals instead. Others, including Eleanor Roosevelt, supported and applauded Truman's decision. MacArthur meanwhile returned to the United States to a hero's welcome, and addressed a joint session of Congress, a speech the president called \\"a bunch of damn bullshit.\\" Truman and his generals considered the use of nuclear weapons against the Chinese army, but ultimately chose not to escalate the war to a nuclear level. The war remained a frustrating stalemate for two years, with over 30,000 Americans killed, until an armistice ended the fighting in 1953. In February 1952, Truman's approval mark stood at 22 percent according to Gallup polls, which is the all-time lowest approval mark for an active U.S. president, though it was matched by Richard Nixon in 1974.Presidential Job Approval for Richard Nixon at the American Presidency Project.  Worldwide defense  Truman and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru during Nehru's visit to the United States, October 1949 The escalation of the Cold War was highlighted by Truman's approval of NSC 68, a secret statement of foreign policy. It called for tripling the defense budget, and the globalization and militarization of containment policy whereby the United States and its NATO allies would respond militarily to actual Soviet expansion. The document was drafted by Paul Nitze, who consulted State and Defense officials, and was formally approved by President Truman as official national strategy after the war began in Korea. It called for partial mobilization of the U.S. economy to build armaments faster than the Soviets. The plan called for strengthening Europe, weakening the Soviet Union, and building up the United States both militarily and economically. Truman and Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi speaking at Washington National Airport, during ceremonies welcoming him to the United States Truman was a strong supporter of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which established a formal peacetime military alliance with Canada and democratic European nations not under Soviet control following World War II. The treaty establishing it was widely popular and easily passed the Senate in 1949; Truman appointed General Eisenhower as commander. NATO's goals were to contain Soviet expansion in Europe and to send a clear message to communist leaders that the world's democracies were willing and able to build new security structures in support of democratic ideals. The United States, Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Portugal, Iceland, and Canada were the original treaty signatories. The alliance resulted in the Soviets establishing a similar alliance, called the Warsaw Pact. General Marshall was Truman's principal adviser on foreign policy matters, influencing such decisions as the U.S. choice against offering direct military aid to Chiang Kai-shek and his nationalist Chinese forces in the Chinese Civil War against their communist opponents. Marshall's opinion was contrary to the counsel of almost all of Truman's other advisers—Marshall thought propping up Chiang's forces would drain U.S. resources necessary for Europe to deter the Soviets. When the communists took control of the mainland, establishing the People's Republic of China and driving the nationalists to Taiwan, Truman would have been willing to maintain some relationship between the United States and the new government but Mao was unwilling. Truman announced on January 5, 1950, that the United States would not engage in any dispute involving the Taiwan Strait, and that he would not intervene in the event of an attack by the PRC. On June 27, 1950, after the outbreak of fighting in Korea, Truman ordered the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent further conflict between the communist government on the China mainland and the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan. Truman usually worked well with his top staff—the exceptions were Israel in 1948 and Spain 1945–1950. Truman was a very strong opponent of Francisco Franco, the right- wing dictator of Spain. He withdrew the American ambassador (but diplomatic relations were not formally broken), kept Spain out of the UN, and rejected any Marshall Plan financial aid to Spain. However, as the Cold War escalated, support for Spain was strong in Congress, the Pentagon, the business community and other influential elements especially Catholics and cotton growers. Liberal opposition to Spain had faded after the Wallace element broke with the Democratic Party in 1948; the CIO became passive on the issue. As Secretary of State Acheson increased his pressure on Truman, the president, stood alone in his administration as his own top appointees wanted to normalize relations. When China entered the Korean War and pushed American forces back, the argument for allies became irresistible. Admitting he was \\"overruled and worn down,\\" Truman relented and sent an ambassador and made loans available.Mark S. Byrnes,\\"'Overruled and Worn Down': Truman Sends an Ambassador to Spain.\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly 29.2 (1999): 263–279.  Soviet espionage and McCarthyism  In August 1948, Whittaker Chambers, a former spy for the Soviets and a senior editor at Time magazine, testified before the House Un- American Activities Committee (HUAC). He said an underground communist network had worked inside the U.S. government during the 1930s, of which Chambers had been a member, along with Alger Hiss, until recently a senior State Department official. Chambers did not allege any spying during the Truman presidency. Although Hiss denied the allegations, he was convicted in January 1950 for perjury for denials under oath. The Soviet Union's success in exploding an atomic weapon in 1949 and the fall of the nationalist Chinese the same year led many Americans to conclude subversion by Soviet spies was responsible, and to demand that communists be rooted out from the government and other places of influence. However, Truman got himself into deeper trouble when he called the Hiss trial a \\"red herring\\". Wisconsin Senator McCarthy accused the State Department of harboring communists and rode the controversy to political fame, leading to the Second Red Scare, also known as McCarthyism. Charges that Soviet agents had infiltrated the government were believed by 78 percent of the people in 1946, and became a major campaign issue for Eisenhower in 1952. Truman was reluctant to take a more radical stance because he feared full disclosure of the extent of communist infiltration would reflect badly on the Democratic Party. In 1949, Truman described American communist leaders, whom his administration was prosecuting, as \\"traitors\\", but in 1950 he vetoed the McCarran Internal Security Act. It was passed over his veto. Truman would later state in private conversations with friends that his creation of a loyalty program had been a \\"terrible\\" mistake.  Blair House and assassination attempt  View of the interior shell of the White House during renovation in 1950 In 1948, Truman ordered an addition to the exterior of the White House: a second-floor balcony in the south portico, which came to be known as the Truman Balcony. The addition was unpopular. Some said it spoiled the appearance of the south facade, but it gave the First Family more living space. The Truman family moved into nearby Blair House during the renovations. As the newer West Wing, including the Oval Office, remained open, Truman walked to and from his work across the street each morning and afternoon. On November 1, 1950, Puerto Rican nationalists Griselio Torresola and Oscar Collazo attempted to assassinate Truman at Blair House. On the street outside the residence, Torresola mortally wounded a White House policeman, Leslie Coffelt. Before he died, the officer shot and killed Torresola. Collazo was wounded and stopped before he entered the house. He was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death in 1952. Truman commuted his sentence to life in prison. To try to settle the question of Puerto Rican independence, Truman allowed a plebiscite in Puerto Rico in 1952 to determine the status of its relationship to the United States. Nearly 82 percent of the people voted in favor of a new constitution for the Estado Libre Asociado, a continued 'associated free state.'.  Steel and coal strikes  In response to a labor/management impasse arising from bitter disagreements over wage and price controls, Truman instructed his Secretary of Commerce, Charles W. Sawyer, to take control of a number of the nation's steel mills in April 1952. Truman cited his authority as Commander in Chief and the need to maintain an uninterrupted supply of steel for munitions for the war in Korea. The Supreme Court found Truman's actions unconstitutional, however, and reversed the order in a major separation-of-powers decision, Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer (1952). The 6–3 decision, which held that Truman's assertion of authority was too vague and was not rooted in any legislative action by Congress, was delivered by a Court composed entirely of Justices appointed by either Truman or Roosevelt. The high court's reversal of Truman's order was one of the notable defeats of his presidency.  Scandals and controversies  Truman in an official portrait In 1950, the Senate, led by Estes Kefauver, investigated numerous charges of corruption among senior administration officials, some of whom received fur coats and deep freezers in exchange for favors. A large number of employees of the Internal Revenue Bureau (today the IRS) were accepting bribes; 166 employees either resigned or were fired in 1950, with many soon facing indictment. When Attorney General J. Howard McGrath fired the special prosecutor in early 1952 for being too zealous, Truman fired McGrath. Truman submitted a reorganization plan to reform the IRB; Congress passed it, but the corruption was a major issue in the 1952 presidential election. On December 6, 1950, Washington Post music critic Paul Hume wrote a critical review of a concert by the president's daughter Margaret Truman: Truman wrote a scathing response: Truman was criticized by many for the letter. However, he pointed out that he wrote it as a loving father and not as the president. In 1951, William M. Boyle, Truman's longtime friend and chairman of the Democratic National Committee, was forced to resign after being charged with financial corruption.Eleonora W. Schoenebaum, ed. Political Profiles: The Truman Years (1978) pp. 48–49. = Civil rights = A 1947 report by the Truman administration titled To Secure These Rights presented a detailed ten-point agenda of civil rights reforms. Speaking about this report, international developments have to be taken into account, for with the UN Charter being passed in 1945, the question whether international human rights law could be applicable also on an inner-land basis became crucial in the United States. Though the report acknowledged such a path was not free from controversy in the 1940s United States, it nevertheless raised the possibility for the UN-Charter to be used as a legal tool to combat racial discrimination in the United States. In February 1948, the president submitted a civil rights agenda to Congress that proposed creating several federal offices devoted to issues such as voting rights and fair employment practices. This provoked a storm of criticism from southern Democrats in the runup to the national nominating convention, but Truman refused to compromise, saying: \\"My forebears were Confederates ... but my very stomach turned over when I had learned that Negro soldiers, just back from overseas, were being dumped out of Army trucks in Mississippi and beaten.\\" Tales of the abuse, violence, and persecution suffered by many African-American veterans upon their return from World War II infuriated Truman, and were a major factor in his decision to issue Executive Order 9981, in July 1948, requiring equal opportunity in the armed forces. In the early 1950s after several years of planning, recommendations and revisions between Truman, the Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity and the various branches of the military, the services became racially integrated. Executive Order 9980, also in 1948, made it illegal to discriminate against persons applying for civil service positions based on race. A third, in 1951, established the Committee on Government Contract Compliance (CGCC). This committee ensured defense contractors did not discriminate because of race. In 1950 he vetoed the McCarran Internal Security Act. It was passed over his veto. = Administration and cabinet = = International trips = Truman made five international trips during his presidency. = 1952 election = President Truman; Alabama Senator John J. Sparkman, vice presidential nominee; and Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson, presidential nominee, in the Oval Office, 1952 In 1951, the United States ratified the 22nd Amendment, making a president ineligible for election to a third term or for election to a second full term after serving more than two remaining years of a term of a previously elected president. The latter clause did not apply to Truman's situation in 1952 because of a grandfather clause excluding the amendment's application to the incumbent president. President Truman conferring with labor leader Walter Reuther about economic policy in the Oval Office, 1952 Therefore, he seriously considered running for another term in 1952, and left his name on the ballot in the New Hampshire primary. However all his close advisors, pointing to his age, his failing abilities, and his poor showing in the polls, talked him out of it.Alonzo L. Hamby. Man of the People: A Life of Harry S. Truman (1995), pp. 602–605. At the time of the 1952 New Hampshire primary, no candidate had won Truman's backing. His first choice, Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson, had declined to run; Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson had also turned Truman down, Vice President Barkley was considered too old, and Truman distrusted and disliked Senator Kefauver, who had made a name for himself by his investigations of the Truman administration scandals. Truman had hoped to recruit General Eisenhower as a Democratic candidate, but found him more interested in seeking the Republican nomination. Accordingly, Truman let his name be entered in the New Hampshire primary by supporters. The highly unpopular Truman was handily defeated by Kefauver; 18 days later the president formally announced he would not seek a second full term. Truman was eventually able to persuade Stevenson to run, and the governor gained the nomination at the 1952 Democratic National Convention. Eisenhower gained the Republican nomination, with Senator Nixon as his running mate, and campaigned against what he denounced as Truman's failures: \\"Korea, communism and corruption\\". He pledged to clean up the \\"mess in Washington,\\" and promised to \\"go to Korea.\\" Eisenhower defeated Stevenson decisively in the general election, ending 20 years of Democratic presidents. While Truman and Eisenhower had previously been on good terms, Truman felt annoyed Eisenhower did not denounce Joseph McCarthy during the campaign. Similarly, Eisenhower was outraged when Truman accused the former general of disregarding \\"sinister forces ... Anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism, and anti-foreignism\\" within the Republican Party.  Post- presidency  =Financial problems= Medicare Bill on , by President Lyndon B. Johnson Upon leaving the presidency, Truman returned to Independence, Missouri, to live at the Wallace home he and Bess had shared for years with her mother. He taught occasional courses at universities, including Yale, where he was a Chubb Fellow visiting lecturer in 1958.Robert H. Ferrell, Farewell to the Chief: Former Presidents in American Public Life, 1991, page 52 In 1962, Truman was a visiting lecturer at Canisius College.U.S. Government Printing Office, Congressional Record, Volume 108, Part 4, 1962, page 5168. As a former president, Truman decided that he did not wish to be on any corporate payroll, believing that taking advantage of such financial opportunities would diminish the integrity of the nation's highest office. He also turned down numerous offers for commercial endorsements. Since his earlier business ventures had proved unsuccessful, he had no personal savings. As a result, he faced financial challenges. Once Truman left the White House, his only income was his old army pension: $112.56 per month (). Former members of Congress and the federal courts received a federal retirement package; President Truman himself ensured that former servants of the executive branch of government received similar support. In 1953, however, there was no such benefit package for former presidents, and he received no pension for his Senate service. Truman had taken out a personal loan from a Washington bank shortly before leaving office. He then found a potentially lucrative book deal for his memoirs. The writing was a struggle for Truman and he went through a dozen collaborators during the project, not all of whom served him well, but he remained heavily involved in the end result. For the memoirs, Truman received a flat payment of $670,000, and had to pay two-thirds of that in tax; he calculated he got $37,000 after he paid his assistants. However, the memoirs were a commercial and critical success. They were published in two volumes: Memoirs by Harry S. Truman: Year of Decisions (1955) and Memoirs by Harry S. Truman: Years of Trial and Hope (1956). The former president told House Majority Leader John McCormack in 1957, \\"Had it not been for the fact that I was able to sell some property that my brother, sister, and I inherited from our mother, I would practically be on relief, but with the sale of that property I am not financially embarrassed.\\" The following year, Congress passed the Former Presidents Act, offering a $25,000 yearly pension to each former president, and it is likely that Truman's financial status played a role in the law's enactment. The only other living former president at the time, Herbert Hoover, also took the pension, even though he did not need the money; reportedly, he did so to avoid embarrassing Truman. =Truman Library= Truman's predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, had organized his own presidential library, but legislation to enable future presidents to do something similar had not been enacted. Truman worked to garner private donations to build a presidential library, which he donated to the federal government to maintain and operate—a practice adopted by his successors. He testified before Congress to have money appropriated to have presidential papers copied and organized, and was proud of the bill's passage in 1957. Max Skidmore, in his book on the life of former presidents, noted that Truman was a well-read man, especially in history. Skidmore added that the presidential papers legislation and the founding of his library \\"was the culmination of his interest in history. Together they constitute an enormous contribution to the United States—one of the greatest of any former president.\\" =Politics= Truman supported Adlai Stevenson's second bid for the White House in 1956, although he had initially favored Democratic Governor W. Averell Harriman of New York. He continued to campaign for Democratic senatorial candidates for many years. In 1960 Truman gave a public statement announcing he would not attend the Democratic Convention that year, citing concerns about the way that the supporters of John F. Kennedy had gained control of the nominating process, and called on Kennedy to forgo the nomination for that year.President Truman, , Press Conference / July 2nd, 1960. Kennedy responded with a press conference where he bluntly rebuked Truman's advice.Senator John F. Kennedy, , Press Conference / July 4th, 1960. In late 1963, when Lyndon B. Johnson had just become president, Truman wrote a letter to the Washington Post calling for the CIA's responsibilities to be scaled back significantly: \\"For some time I have been disturbed by the way the CIA has been diverted from its original assignment. It has become an operational and at times a policy-making arm of the government. This has led to trouble and may have compounded our difficulties in several explosive areas.\\"Limit CIA Role To Intelligence by Harry S Truman, The Washington Post, December 22, 1963 Upon turning 80 in 1964, Truman was feted in Washington, and addressed the Senate, availing himself of a new rule that allowed former presidents to be granted privilege of the floor. =Medicare= After a fall in his home in late 1964, his physical condition declined. In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Medicare bill at the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum and gave the first two Medicare cards to Truman and his wife Bess to honor the former president's fight for government health care while in office.  Death  Wreath by Truman's casket, December 27, 1972 On December 5, 1972, Truman was admitted to Kansas City's Research Hospital and Medical Center with pneumonia. He developed multiple organ failure, fell into a coma, and died at 7:50 a.m. on December 26, at the age of 88. Bess Truman opted for a simple private service at the library rather than a state funeral in Washington. A week after the funeral, foreign dignitaries and Washington officials attended a memorial service at Washington National Cathedral. Bess died in 1982 and is buried next to Harry at the Harry S. Truman Library and Museum in Independence, Missouri.  Tributes and legacy  Biographer Robert Donovan has tried to capture Truman's personality: = Legacy = Truman poses in 1959 at the recreation of the Truman Oval Office at the Truman Library in 1959, with the famous \\"The Buck Stops Here\\" sign on his desk. (The reverse of the sign says, \\"I'm From Missouri\\".) Attendees to meetings where Truman would have to make a major decision would sometimes see the president looking at the sign. Citing continuing divisions within the Democratic Party, the ongoing Cold War, and the boom and bust cycle, journalist Samuel Lubell in 1952 stated: \\"After seven years of Truman's hectic, even furious, activity the nation seemed to be about on the same general spot as when he first came to office ... Nowhere in the whole Truman record can one point to a single, decisive break-through ... All his skills and energies—and he was among our hardest-working Presidents—were directed to standing still.\\" When he left office in 1953, Truman was one of the most unpopular chief executives in history. His job approval rating of 22% in the Gallup Poll of February 1952 was lower than Richard Nixon's 24% in August 1974, the month Nixon resigned, but matched by Nixon's all-time low in January 1974. Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum in Independence, Missouri U.S. public feeling towards Truman grew steadily warmer with the passing years; as early as 1962, a poll of 75 historians conducted by Arthur M. Schlesinger Sr. ranked Truman among the \\"near great\\" presidents. The period following his death consolidated a partial rehabilitation of his legacy among both historians and members of the public. Truman died when the nation was consumed with crises in Vietnam and Watergate, and his death brought a new wave of attention to his political career. In the early and mid-1970s, Truman captured the popular imagination much as he had in 1948, this time emerging as a kind of political folk hero, a president who was thought to exemplify an integrity and accountability which many observers felt was lacking in the Nixon White House. This public reassessment of Truman was aided by the popularity of a book of reminiscences Truman had recounted to journalist Merle Miller beginning in 1961, with the agreement that they would not be published until after Truman's death. Truman has had his latter-day critics as well. After a review of information available to Truman about the presence of espionage activities in the U.S. government, Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan concluded that Truman was \\"almost wilfully obtuse\\" concerning the danger of U.S. communism. In 2010, historian Alonzo Hamby concluded that \\"Harry Truman remains a controversial president.\\" However, since leaving office, Truman has fared well in polls ranking the presidents. He has never been listed lower than ninth, and was ranked fifth in a C-SPAN poll in 2009. The Dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 caused Truman advocates to claim vindication for his decisions in the postwar period. According to Truman biographer Robert Dallek, \\"His contribution to victory in the cold war without a devastating nuclear conflict elevated him to the stature of a great or near- great president.\\" The 1992 publication of David McCullough's favorable biography of Truman further cemented the view of Truman as a highly regarded chief executive. According to historian Donald R. McCoy in his book on the Truman presidency: = Sites and honors = Stamp issued in 1973, following Truman's death. Truman has been honored on five U.S. postage stamps, issued between 1973 and 1999. In 1953, Truman received the Solomon Bublick Award of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 1956, Truman traveled to Europe with his wife. In England, he met with Churchill and received an honorary Doctor of Civil Law degree from Oxford University. Across Britain he was hailed; London's Daily Telegraph characterized Truman as the \\"Living and kicking symbol of everything that everybody likes best about the United States.\\" In 1959, he was given a 50-year award by the Masons, recognizing his longstanding involvement: he was initiated on February 9, 1909, into the Belton Masonic Lodge in Missouri. In 1911, he helped establish the Grandview Lodge, and he served as its first Worshipful Master. In September 1940, during his Senate re-election campaign, Truman was elected Grand Master of the Missouri Grand Lodge of Freemasonry; Truman said later that the Masonic election assured his victory in the general election. In 1945, he was made a 33° Sovereign Grand Inspector General and an Honorary Member of the supreme council at the Supreme Council A.A.S.R. Southern Jurisdiction Headquarters in Washington D.C. He was also a member of the Shriners and the Royal Order of Jesters, two affiliated bodies of Masonry. Truman was also a member of Sons of the American Revolution (SAR) and the Sons of Confederate Veterans. Two of his relatives were Confederate soldiers. In 1975, the Truman Scholarship was created as a federal program to honor U.S. college students who exemplified dedication to public service and leadership in public policy. In 2004, the President Harry S. Truman Fellowship in National Security Science and Engineering was created as a distinguished postdoctoral three-year appointment at Sandia National Laboratories. In 2001, the University of Missouri established the Harry S. Truman School of Public Affairs to advance the study and practice of governance. The University of Missouri's Missouri Tigers athletic programs have an official mascot named Truman the Tiger. On July 1, 1996, Northeast Missouri State University became Truman State University—to mark its transformation from a teachers' college to a highly selective liberal arts university and to honor the only Missourian to become president. A member institution of the City Colleges of Chicago, Harry S Truman College in Chicago, Illinois, is named in his honor for his dedication to public colleges and universities. In 2000, the headquarters for the State Department, built in the 1930s but never officially named, was dedicated as the Harry S Truman Building. Despite Truman's attempt to curtail the naval carrier arm, which led to the 1949 Revolt of the Admirals, an aircraft carrier, , was named for him in February 1996. The 129th Field Artillery Regiment is designated \\"Truman's Own\\" in recognition of Truman's service as commander of its D Battery during World War I. In 1984, Truman was posthumously awarded the United States Congressional Gold Medal. In 1991, he was inducted into the Hall of Famous Missourians, and a bronze bust depicting him is on permanent display in the rotunda of the Missouri State Capitol. Other sites associated with Truman include: * Harry S. Truman National Historic Site includes the Wallace House at 219 N.

It is an old town on the bank of the Brahmaputra river, with historical significance. In 1883, the town was first constituted as a Municipal Board under the British regime. It is situated about west from Dispur, the state capital of Assam. The town is also an important commercial centre and had a busy river port particularly for jute. Dhubri is called the \\"Land of Rivers\\" as it is covered three sides by Brahmaputra and Gadadhar rivers.  History  Gurdwara Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Sahib at Dhubri Gurdwara Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Sahib Complex Chilarai Statue at Dhubri The word 'Dhuburi' comes from a legendary lady named Netai-Dhubuni. Legends say that Netai-Dhubuni was a laundress who used to wash clothes of the Gods and Goddesses in a small ghat in Dhubri. The story is connected with Behula- Lakhindar. Lakhinar was the son of Chand Sadagar and Behula was Lakhindar's spouse. The word Dhubri is believed to have originated from the word 'Dhubuni' (a lady who washes clothes). According to Bodo-Kacharis, the word is of Bodo origin and derived from Dubra, a kind of grass. The story of lady Netai- Dhubuni is widely accepted for the naming history of Dhubri. Adjacent to this Netai-Dhubuni ghat, there is the Gurdwara Sri Tegh Bahadur Sahib stands. This place is famous for the Sikh Gurdwara Gurdwara Damdama Sahib or Thara Sahib which was constructed in memory of visit of First Sikh Guru Nanak Dev and later it was followed by visit of Ninth guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur and the Gurdwara is named as Gurdwara Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Sahib. Hence, it has great importance for Sikh community. Until 1874, Dhubri was mostly a part of Bengal kings. In 1874, the British Government created a new province named Assam Valley Province and incorporated Goalpara district area comprising three civil subdivisions Dhubri, Goalpara and Kokrajhar with the new Assam Province. In 1879, the district headquarters was shifted from Goalpara to Dhubri city. The district of Dhubri is again subdivided in three districts namely Dhubri, Goalpara and Kokrajhar. The City of Dhubri falls under the jurisdiction of the district of Dhubri whose headquarters is at city Dhubri. The present Dhubri District is one of the three Civil Sub-divisions of erst-while Goalpara district, established in 1876 during British regime. In 1879 the District headquarters was shifted from Goalpara to Dhubri. In the year 1983 Goalpara district was divided into four separate districts and Dhubri is one of those. Covering an area of 2,838 km2. including forests, riverines, hills etc. the district has become the most densely populated district in India with a density of 584 persons per km2.(As per 2001 census). Dhubri District has been visited by many historical personalities like Guru Nanaka, Srimanta Sankardeva, Guru Teg Bahadur, Swami Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Gopinath Bordoloi and others. Dhubri town also was very famous for the Match Factory (WIMCO), though it has shut down due to circumstances but still people who had witnessed the same still remembering the beauty of the factory its staff quarters and their modern art of living.

This sanctuary has been named as \\"Chakrashila Wildlife Sanctuary\\". This is the youngest sanctuary of the North East India having an area of . Chakrasila is unique because of the presence of golden langur (Presbytis geei) which is found nowhere else except along the Assam and Bhutan border. Besides, the virgin forest of Chakrasila Wildlife Sanctuary is endowed with rare specimens of trees, shrubs, medicinal plants, mammals, reptiles and exquisite birds and insects. Geographical location of the Chakrasila Wildlife Sanctuary is in the latitude 26° 15' to 26° 26' N and longitude 90° 15' to 90 ° 20' E. It is in the District of Dhubri, the western most region of Assam. It is 68 km from the District headquarters Dhubri and 219 km from the Borjhar Airport of Guwahati City. There are several small springs for quenching the thirst of the wild animals of this hilly forest. But the two major perennial springs in the sanctuary are howhowi Jhora and Bamuni Jhora, which flow over the rocks, sparkling and spattering throughout the year, adding to the scenic beauty of the sanctuary. Climatic conditions of Chakrasila Wildlife Sanctuary is like that of temperate zone with dry winter and hot summer followed by heavy rains. Annual rainfall is between 200 and 400 cm. Soil is azonal, forestlike and hilly. temperature throughout the year generally varies between 8 °C to 30 °C. The diverse ecosystems of Chakrasila present a model habitat diversity and support various mammalian species like tiger, leopard, golden langur, leopard cat, gaur, mongoose, porcupine, pangolin, flying squirrel, civet cat, etc. Along with all these prolific gifts of the nature Chakrasila has a wide variety of avifauna. The two internationally recognized wetlands namely Dhir and Deeplai has not been yet taken inside the declared boundary of the sanctuary. But they are very a part of the Chakrasila eco-system. It is expected that in due course they will be included within the sanctuary.

This anomalous pulmonary venous return can be either partial (PAPVR) or total (TAPVR). The syndrome associated with PAPVR is more commonly known as Scimitar syndrome after the curvilinear pattern created on a chest radiograph by the pulmonary veins that drain to the inferior vena cava. This radiographic density often has the shape of a scimitar, a type of curved sword. The syndrome was first described by Catherine Neill in 1960. Presentation The anomalous venous return forms a curved shadow on chest x-ray such that it resembles a scimitar. This is called the Scimitar Sign. Associated abnormalities include right lung hypoplasia with associated dextroposition of the heart, pulmonary artery hypoplasia and pulmonary sequestration. Incidence is around 1 per 100,000 births.M.Hasan, A.Varshney. A case of scimitar syndrome: anesthetic considerations regarding non cardiac surgery. Pediatric Anesthesia and Critical Care Journal 2016;4(2):89-90 doi:10.14587/paccj.2016.18 . Diagnosis Chest x-ray of a five-year-old girl with Scimitar syndrome. The heart (blue outline) is shifted into the right half of the chest, and the anomalous pulmonary venous return (red) has a shape reminiscent of a Scimitar. The diagnosis is made by transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography, angiography, and more recently by CT angiography or MR Angiography. Treatment Surgical correction should be considered in the presence of significant left to right shunting (Qp:Qs ≥ 2:1) and pulmonary hypertension. This involves creation of an inter-atrial baffle to redirect the pulmonary venous return into the left atrium. Alternatively, the anomalous vein can be re-implanted directly into the left atrium.

Russell was laid down on 20 December 1937 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Newport News, Virginia; launched on 8 December 1938; sponsored by Mrs. Charles H. Marshall, granddaughter of Rear Admiral Russell; and commissioned on 3 November 1939, Lieutenant Commander J. C. Pollock in command. Service history Commissioned two months after the outbreak of World War II in Europe, Russell cruised in the western Atlantic and in the Caribbean on neutrality patrol until the bombing of Pearl Harbor. File:Original_plaque_from_USS_Russell_DD_414.jpgPlaque from USS Russell DD 414 =World War II= 1942 Russell was ordered to the Pacific, and she transited the Panama Canal and proceeded to San Diego, where on 6 January 1942, she sailed west, screening reinforcements to Samoa. By the time of her arrival, 20 January, the Japanese had moved into British Malaya, Borneo, the Celebes and Gilbert Islandss, and the Bismarck Archipelago. Within the week, Rabaul fell and the Japanese continued on to New Ireland and the Solomons while further west they extended their occupation of the Netherlands East Indies. On 25 January, Russell sailed north with Task Force 17 (TF 17), screened as her planes raided Makin, Mili, and Jaluit on 1 February, then set a course for Pearl Harbor. In midmonth, the force sailed again. Diverted from its original destination, Wake Island, it covered forces establishing an airbase on Canton Island, important on the Hawaii-Samoa-Fiji route to Australia and less than 1,000 miles (1,600 km) from Makin. Raids on Rabaul and Gasmata were next ordered to cover a movement of troops to New Caledonia, but on 8 March the Japanese landed at Salamaua and Lae in New Guinea and Port Moresby was threatened. The force, again joined by the force, steamed into the Gulf of Papua, where on 10 March, planes were sent over the Owen Stanley Range to bomb the newly established Japanese bases on the Huon Gulf. Through April, Russell continued to screen the Yorktown force, operating primarily in the ANZAC area. Detached on 3 May to screen during fueling operations with TF 11, she rejoined TF 17 early on 5 May and resumed screening duties for the force's heavier units. On 7 May in the Coral Sea, she engaged enemy planes closing the formation to threaten Yorktown and Lexington and to support Japanese forces in an assault on Port Moresby. Lexington hit and heavily damaged, but still in action, continued to recover and launch planes. Three hours later, however, she reported a serious explosion. A second followed. Her fires were no longer under control. She soon commenced abandoning ship. Russell joined her screen, circled the crippled ship as rescue ships evacuated personnel, and with the completion of that work, departed the scene of the Battle of the Coral Sea. Retiring to Tonga, Russell debarked 170 survivors from Lexington and sailed for Pearl Harbor. Arriving on 27 May, she headed out again on 30 May, this time toward Midway Island. On 4 June, TFs 16 and 17 again met the enemy in an air duel, through which Russell steamed in the screen of Yorktown. In the afternoon, enemy torpedo planes broke through the screen and scored successfully on the carrier. The patched-up survivor of the Battle of the Coral Sea was abandoned. Russell took on 492 of her crew and aviation personnel. The next day she transferred 27 to to assist in salvage operations on the carrier, but Japanese torpedoes (from ) negated the effort and Yorktown and were lost. On 10 June, Russell covered the transferral of replacements from to and , and on 13 June, she returned to Pearl Harbor. Engaged in training exercises for the next 2 months, Russell again sortied with TF 17 on 17 August, took station screening Hornet, and headed southwest. On the 29th, TF 17 joined TF 61, becoming Task Group 61.2 (TG 61.2). On the 31st, Saratoga took a torpedo and Russell conducted an unsuccessful submarine hunt, the first of many in the long and costly campaign for Guadalcanal. On 6 September, one of Hornets planes dropped an explosive off Russells starboard quarter to detonate a torpedo. Another submarine search commenced. At 1452, she established contact and dropped six 600-pound depth charges. At 1513, she sighted an oil slick 1 mile by one-half-mile, but contact was lost at 700 yards and never regained. Through the remainder of the year, and into the new, Russell continued to operate in support of the Guadalcanal campaign. On 25–26 October, she participated in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, during which she again joined in rescue operations for a sinking carrier, this time Hornet, from which she transferred the commander of TF 17, Rear Admiral George D. Murray and his staff to , seriously wounded personnel to , and other survivors to Nouméa where Russells superstructure, damaged during rescue work, was repaired. 1943 In December 1942 – January 1943, she screened convoys to Guadalcanal and Tulagi, then to Rennell. In February, she screened Enterprise, then in March, resumed convoy escort work, making one run to Australia and back by mid-April. On 1 May, the destroyer set a course for the west coast. At the end of July, after overhaul at Mare Island, she steamed north to join forces staging for the \\"invasion\\" of Kiska Island. Aleutian patrol duty followed, and with the arrival of autumn, she turned south to escort landing craft to Hawaii. In October, she continued on to Wellington, New Zealand; and, in early November, she escorted transports to the New Hebrides where she joined TF 53, then preparing to push into the Gilberts. Underway on 13 November with the Task Force, she arrived with the troop transports off Betio, Tarawa, on 20 November, then screened heavier units as they shelled the shore. Remaining in the area until 25 November, she provided gunfire support and screened the transports as they filled with Marine casualties. On 27 November, she joined TG 50.3 and, with TG 50.1, sailed for the Marshall Islands. On 4 December, carrier planes raided Kwajalein and Wotje, and on 9 December, the force returned to Pearl Harbor, whence Russell continued on to the west coast. 1944 On 13 January 1944, Russell, screening TG 53.5, departed the California coast. Training in the Hawaiian Islands followed. On the 22nd, the force headed west. On 30 January, Russell joined other destroyers and heavier units in shelling Wotje. On 31 January, she rejoined the main force off Kwajalein and, after initial screening duties, added her guns to the naval gunfire support line. On 2 February, she screened Carrier Division 22 (CarDiv 22) and on the 3rd, entered Kwajalein lagoon. Standing out 5 days later, she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 15 February and was directed on to Puget Sound for repairs. Repairs completed in March, Russell returned to Hawaii in early April, then escorted Willard Holbrook to New Guinea where she rejoined DesRon 2. Arriving at Finschhafen on 4 May, she reported to the commander of TF 76 at Sudest on 6 May and commenced 5 months of intensive and navigationally difficult escort work along the New Guinea coast. Assigned initially to escort LSTs resupplying Hollandia and Aitape, she joined TF 77 on 16 May and covered LCIs and ATs to the Wakde-Sarmi area. From 17–20 May, she stood off Wakde, marking the approach channel on the first day of the campaigns there and providing fire support and screening services on the others. On 20 May, she returned to Humboldt Bay and 5 days later sailed with LSTs for Biak to commence Operation \\"Horlick.\\" On 27 May, she shelled Padaido Islands, patrolled between Pai and Padaidori Islands, blasted targets on Biak, and then got underway to return to Humboldt Bay. Into June, she continued to escort convoys to and provide cover for operations at Biak and Wakde. In mid-June, she participated in a bombardment of the Toem area, then resumed escort runs along the coast. In early July, Noemfoor, with its two Japanese airfields, became the target. At midmonth Russell gained a brief respite at Manus Island, then at the end of the month commenced Operation \\"Globetrotter\\", the capture of Sansapor. Through August, she continued operations in support of the campaign and, in mid-September, moved forward to the Molucca Islands to cover the occupation of Morotai, the last stepping stone on the southern route to the Philippines and on the eastern route to Borneo and the Netherlands East Indies. On 13 October, Russell sailed with TF 78 for the Philippines and on 20 October, as the troops of the Northern Attack Force landed south of Tacloban, patrolled off Alabat Point. On 21 October, she took up fire support duties to the north of the unloading area. Until 24 October, she remained in San Pedro Bay, resumed patrol in Leyte Gulf on 25 October, and on 26 October, got underway for New Guinea, where, in November–December, she escorted reinforcements to Leyte. On 28 December, Russell departed Aitape for the invasion of Luzon, and steamed into the Mindoro Strait on 5 January 1945. Two days later, she joined three other destroyers in forming an interceptor force 5 miles on the starboard of the San Fabian Attack Force to destroy any enemy ships attempting a sortie from Manila Bay against the convoy. At 2230, was detected and fired on. Hinoki exploded and sank within 20 minutes. Russell was ordered to pick up survivors from the Hinoki. Although several swimmers were seen in the water, they refused to be rescued. 1945 On 9 January, the force, having survived harassing attacks by planes, boats, and ships, arrived in Lingayen Gulf and Russell assumed screening duties off the transport area. For 9 days, she patrolled, illuminated, bombarded, and fought off kamikazes. From 18–23 January, she escorted damaged ships back to Leyte and, on 27 January, sailed north again. On 31 January, she arrived off Nasugbu Bay, covered YMSs (Motor Minesweepers) as they cleared approach channels, then fired on enemy emplacements on Nasugbu Point. Relieved in late afternoon, she returned to Lingayen Gulf, thence, on 2 February, to Leyte, New Guinea, and the Solomons. Russell arrived at Guadalcanal on 15 February, rejoined the 5th Fleet and prepared for Operation \\"Iceberg\\", the Okinawa offensive. On 1 April, she arrived off the assault beaches and commenced screening the Northern Transport area. From 3–5 April, she patrolled north of Ie Shima, then returned to the transport area to escort a convoy to Ulithi. Returning to the Hagushi beaches with reinforcements on 21 February, she shifted to Kerama Retto, whence she patrolled in carrier operating area \\"Rapier\\", south of Okinawa, into May. Detached from carrier screening duty on 27 May, she proceeded to the Hagushi anchorage and got underway the following day for the United States and a yard overhaul. Still undergoing overhaul at Seattle, Washington when the war ended, Russell was prepared for inactivation during September, and on 15 November, she was decommissioned. Thirteen days later she was struck from the Navy List and, in September 1947, she was sold for scrap to the National Metal and Steel Corporation, Terminal Island, Los Angeles. Awards Russell earned 16 battle stars during World War II, making her among the most decorated US ships of World War II.

She was the founder of the GAEA Women's Professional Wrestling organization (known simply as GAEA). She briefly competed as alter-ego Lady Zero in GAEA. Nagayo appears in the 2000 documentary Gaea Girls made for the BBC by Kim Longinotto and Jano Williams. Nagayo has been called \\"the most popular woman wrestler of all-time\\". Professional wrestling career =All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling (1980-1986)= Nagayo debuted on August 8, 1980 for All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling against Yukari Omori. She cried upon losing and was scolded by Tommy Aoyama, a member of the Queen's Angels, who was retiring that night. Through 1981, she only wrestled eight times due to the promotion having too many wrestlers. On January 4, 1983, Nagayo was matched against her future partner and one half of the future The Crush Gals, Lioness Asuka. They had a standout performance and got a good reaction, which lead to them becoming partners. The Crush Gal name was created from a combination of a nickname of Akira Maeda and a Japanese magazine called, \\"Gals\\". The team gained popularity after a losing effort on August 27, 1983 in a WWWA Tag Title match against Yukari Omori and Jumbo Hori. The teams wrestled again in January 1984 to a 60-minute draw. They then wrestled to another 60 minute draw against Jaguar Yokota and Devil Masami in June 1984 to a crowd of 5,000 fans. The team released their first music single on August 21, 1984, called \\"Bible of Fire\\", eventually selling over 100,000 copies. Nagayo claimed to have never sang in public prior to this single. On August 25, 1984, The Crush Gals finally defeated their rivals Omori and Hori, capturing the WWWA World Tag Team Championship. In 1985, the Crush Gals began their rivalry with Dump Matsumoto's heel stable, Gokuaku Domei (\\"Atrocious Alliance\\"). The feud drew consistent ratings over 12.0 for AJW's weekly television program on Fuji TV. Nagayo claimed she had to move frequently during this time due to large amounts of fans waiting outside her home. On February 25, 1985, Matsumoto and Crane Yu defeated The Crush Gals for the WWWA tag titles. In June 1985, Nagayo competed in the 1985 Japan Grand Prix, losing in the semi-finals to Matsumoto.

Notable alumni include Douglas Adams, John Cleese, Prince Edward, Tim Brooke-Taylor, Andy Hamilton and Graeme Garden. CULES is a non-profit society, and emphasises 'non-serious' theatre, comic pun-filled scripts, and including those who do not wish to become 'serious' actors.  History  = Early years = CULES was founded in 1958. In its heyday in the early 1960s, it was considered a drama society on par with the legendary Footlights. Performing revues and comic sketches, it could boast such future celebrities as John Cleese and Graeme Garden amongst its members (with Flanders and Swann as honorary presidents of the society). In the 1970s, the focus shifted to more music-hall shows, often performed in homes for the elderly. During this period, the likes of Andy Hamilton and Douglas Adams were members (the latter, having found Footlights \\"aloof and rather pleased with themselves\\", joined CULES insteadDouglas Adams website ). These were complemented by musicals and revues in the 1980s, with members such as Sandi Toksvig and Prince Edward. = Recent history = The society returned to comedy and pantomime in the 1990s and 2000s, interpreting stories such as Dick Whittington, Wind in the Willows and Snow White. After a brief lull in the early 2000s, when membership was down to just a handful of students, CULES was revived in 2002 after a successful pantomime of Little Red Riding Hood. Since then, there have been two parallel productions for each term. 2003 saw the introduction of an Easter term production of four short plays around a common theme (for example, in 2003, Shakespeare was parodied in CULES productions of Othello, Romeo and Juliet, The Tempest and Macbeth). The society has adapted Cinderella and The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe for pantomime, performed plays such as A Charming Little Murder Mystery and Diary of a Nobody. It has even created entirely new pantomime scripts (for example Once Upon a Time).CULES Archive. = Links with Oxford and other Light Entertainment Societies = As the society grew, it reestablished links with its sister society at Oxford University, the Oxford University Light Entertainment Society (OULES), which had been re-founded by a former CULES member several years previously. Every summer, the two societies had organised a joint production in the form of VOLES (the Various Other Light Entertainment Societies), which mostly performed for homes for the elderly in rural Britain. In addition to VOLES, the two societies organised an annual Varsity match (in the tradition of rivalry between the two universities). The two societies would perform a play jointly, with one performing the first act, the other the second, and the third being performed by a mixed cast, the winner being declared by a panel of judges, who would award points not only for acting, but also for improvisation, phony accents, and use of spurious words, amongst others. The first Varsity match, in 2003, was a tie (won by Oxford after a tiebreaking game of rock, paper, scissors), and the tradition has continued since. A very successful society has existed for over 6 years at Sheffield University, having been set up by former Oxford Student and OULES members. Their name is USLES – The University of Sheffield Light Entertainment Society.  Activities  Each term, the society performs one or more pieces of (usually comic) theatre, with emphasis on low budget and high creativity. Staples include pantomime, comic plays, revues, and skits, but in the past the society has also shot a short film and put on a music talent competition, amongst others. All are invariably realised on a minimal budget to maximise the donations to charity. CULES performances can be demanding, with difficult audiences (for instance, disabled children, or hospital patients...) and highly improvised facilities (such as a school gymnasium). The pantomimes performed are almost always written by members of the society, and include many parodies of popular songs (such songs by ABBA or Queen) with accompanying dance moves, while the comic plays may be original works or adaptations (such as the Jeeves and Wooster plays by P. G. Wodehouse, or a play by Oscar Wilde), see below), through making full use of the members' (sometimes unusual) possessions and creative talents. Elaborate costumes and props are often created at great effort, with little more than cloth, cardboard and string – often adding to the humour in a production. In Michaelmas and Lent terms, the productions are taken to special needs schools, homes for the elderly, homeless shelters, and hospital wards, for whose occupants these performances often represent a welcome departure from an otherwise monotonous daily routine. A final performance is organised for the students of the university. This final performance often entails script changes, usually through adding lewd or suggestive dialogue which would not have been appropriate for other audiences. In Easter term, the schedule is compressed into the final week, before May Week. The productions during Easter term tend to have much smaller casts and shorter running time to allow them to be rehearsed and performed in a week. In recent years a series of productions have been run in parallel, with a consistent theme (such as Greek myths or plays by Shakespeare). As usual, these plays are almost always written by members of the society, and often heavily lampoon their subject matter. The plays are dedicated to Emma Clements, a CULES member that was lost to cancer in 1996, and performed for a student audience in one of the college gardens of Cambridge.  Membership  All members of CULES are students or former students at Cambridge University, and membership is free. It is unique amongst Cambridge drama societies in that it seeks to include students who have an interest in drama (particularly non- serious drama) but may lack the necessary ability or free time to join one of the other drama societies (such as Footlights or the Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club). It also aims to give them experience with roles such as writer, director, producer, technician, choreographer and musical director to complement the acting. Several well-known former members of CULES (see above) went on to successful careers in the entertainment business.  Edinburgh Fringe  In 2003, CULES and OULES created the Two Shades of BlueTwoShades of Blue website theatre group to perform at the Edinburgh Fringe festival with their own version of The Three Musketeers. With performances to over three hundred audience members, the show was a success. A year later, Two Shades of Blue returned to the Fringe with their take on the Dracula story. Performing at the Bedlam Theatre, they improved on their success from the previous year, attaining audience figures well above average for both the venue and the festival as a whole.Review In 2005, Two Shades of Blue brought, for the first time, two shows to the Fringe, The Wind in the Willows and The Dalmatian of Faust. Both played to positive reviews.Review, edinburghguide.com The group returned to the Edinburgh Fringe in 2006 with a Science Fiction spoof, Paradox- Set Phasers to Pun! which smashed previous audience records. 2007 saw sell-out performances of \\"The Matrix: The Pantomime\\", and \\"Comedy and Cake: A teatime revue\\" at the Edinburgh Fringe. 2008 saw the group return with Back to the Future: The Pantomime and \\"Comedy and Cake\\". They also staged Back to the Future: The Pantomime in 2012. Charitable aims CULES contributes almost all the revenue from its student productions to charity. In recent years, it has succeeded in raising several hundred pounds a term to support such causes as The Samaritans, cancer support and children's hospices.CULES links References  External links  * Cambridge University Light Entertainment Society (CULES) * Oxford University Light Entertainment Society (OULES) * Two Shades of Blue * Portal for Light Entertainment societies Entertainment Category:Theatre in Cambridge Category:1958 establishments in England Category:Student organizations established in 1958 ","title":"Cambridge University Light Entertainment Society"},{"id":"3418390","text":"Eupseudosoma is a genus of moths in the family Erebidae.

Broadcast The first era of the programme came on 24 July 2000 when it was designed as a programme shown on BBC One and BBC Two in the summer and easter holidays. This format was repeated annually until the launch of the CBBC Channel in 2002. As a result, 1,040 episodes over two years were initially ordered. At that time, it was the BBC's biggest ever single in-house commission. On the CBBC Channel, it was a continuous, daily, hour-long format broadcast from 7:30am. Although, by the time the programme ended in March 2006, it was being broadcast twice daily in thirty-minute durations.

History National Metal and Steel was the final destination for many decommissioned United States Navy ships. In 1953 it was the first U.S. company to export scrap metal to postwar Japan. It provided for the demolition of many famed Pacific Electric Railway red cars and Los Angeles Railway yellow cars as those public transit systems were eliminated in the Greater Los Angeles Area. Also, a number of the very heavy coal-fired Southern Pacific class AC-9 articulated locomotives were demolished here. For operational reasons, they had been usable mainly only in New Mexico and Texas, and were very rarely operated elsewhere on the SP system due to clearance considerations. Operations on Terminal Island ceased on 1 January 1986 when the company lost that facility to a harbor expansion project. National Metal and Steel maintained headquarters in the nearby city of Carson.

Traditionally, a factory outlet was a store attached to a factory or warehouse, sometimes allowing customers to watch the production process such as in the original L.L. Bean store. In modern usage, outlet stores are typically manufacturer- branded stores such as Gap or Bon Worth grouped together in outlet malls. The invention of the factory outlet store is often credited to Harold Alfond, founder of the Dexter Shoe Company.  History  Merrimack Premium Outlets in New Hampshire in 2012 Outlets first appeared in the eastern United States in the 1930s. Factory stores started to offer damaged or excess goods to employees at a low price. After some time, the audience expanded to include non-employees. In 1936, Anderson-Little (a men's clothing brand) opened an outlet store independent of its existing factories. Until the 1970s, the primary purpose of outlet stores was to dispose of excess or damaged goods. In 1974, Vanity Fair opened up the first multi-store outlet center in Reading, Pennsylvania. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, outlet malls grew rapidly in the United States. A typical outlet mall in the U.S. is opened with between 100,000 to 200,000 square feet (about 1 to 2 hectares) of retail space. This can gradually increase to 500,000 to 600,000 feet (around 5 hectares). The average outlet mall has an area of 216,000 square feet. In 2003, outlet malls in the U.S. generated $15 billion in revenue from 260 stores. The number of U.S. malls increased from 113 in 1988 to 276 in 1991 and to 325 in 1997 and 472 in 2013. Outlet malls are not an exclusively American phenomenon. In Canada, the Dixie Outlet Mall dates from the late 1980s, and was followed by Vaughan Mills in 1999, and Toronto Premium Outlets in 2013. In Europe, retailer BAA McArthurGlen has opened 13 malls with over 1,200 stores and 3 million square feet (about 30 hectares) of retail space; describing itself as an \\"outlet village\\", Bicester Village, on the edge of the town of Bicester in Oxfordshire in England, is a regular stop for bus-tours of foreign tourists, especially from China. Stores have also been emerging in Japan since the mid to late 1990s. Difference between factory outlet and outlet store At factory outlets, the products sold are from one brand only. Manufacturers who sell only their own products at a reduced price run factory outlets. On the other hand, retailers run outlet stores, and various brands are sold there. Factory outlets have been around longer than outlet stores and were typically built next to the factories where the products were manufactured.

His opinions drew no controversy when originally published in the London newspaper The Evening Standard, but drew angry reactions from Christian communities when republished in the United States that July. Lennon's comments incited protests and threats, particularly throughout the Bible Belt in the Southern United States. Some radio stations stopped playing Beatles songs, records were publicly burned, press conferences were cancelled, and the Ku Klux Klan picketed concerts. The controversy coincided with the band's 1966 US tour and overshadowed press coverage of their newest album Revolver. Lennon apologised at a series of press conferences and explained that he was not comparing himself to Christ. The controversy exacerbated the band's unhappiness with touring, which they never undertook again. Lennon also refrained from touring in his solo career. In 1980, he was murdered by Mark David Chapman, a born-again Christian who was motivated partly by Lennon's remarks on religion and \\"more popular than Jesus\\" quote. Background  In March 1966, London's Evening Standard ran a weekly series titled \\"How Does a Beatle Live?\\" that featured John Lennon, Ringo Starr, George Harrison and Paul McCartney. The articles were written by Maureen Cleave, who knew the group well and had interviewed them regularly since the start of Beatlemania in the United Kingdom. She had described them three years earlier as \\"the darlings of Merseyside\\", and in February 1964 had accompanied them on their first visit to the United States. She chose to interview the band members individually for the lifestyle series, rather than as a group. Cleave carried out the interview with Lennon in February at his home, Kenwood, in Weybridge. Her article portrayed him as restless and searching for meaning in his life; he discussed his interest in Indian music and said he gleaned most of his knowledge from reading books. Among Lennon's many possessions, Cleave found a full-sized crucifix, a gorilla costume, a medieval suit of armour and a well-organised library with works by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Jonathan Swift, Oscar Wilde, George Orwell and Aldous Huxley. Another book, Hugh J. Schonfield's The Passover Plot, had influenced Lennon's ideas about Christianity, although Cleave did not refer to it in the article. She mentioned that Lennon was \\"reading extensively about religion\\", and quoted him as saying: Cleave's interview with Lennon was published in The Evening Standard on 4 March under the secondary heading \\"On a hill in Surrey ... A young man, famous, loaded, and waiting for something\\". The article provoked no controversy in the UK. Church attendance there was in decline and Christian churches were attempting to transform their image, to make themselves more \\"relevant to modern times\\". According to author Jonathan Gould: \\"The satire comedians had had a field day with the increasingly desperate attempts of the Church to make itself seem more relevant ('Don't call me vicar, call me Dick ...').\\" In 1963, Bishop of Woolwich John A.T. Robinson published Honest to God urging the nation to reject traditional church teachings on morality and the concept of God as an \\"old man in the sky\\", and instead embrace a universal ethic of love. Bryan R. Wilson's 1966 text Religion in Secular Society explained that increasing secularisation led to British churches being abandoned. However, traditional Christian faith was still strong and widespread in the United States at that time. The theme of religion's irrelevance in American society had nevertheless been featured in a cover article titled \\"Is God Dead?\\" in Time magazine, in an issue dated 8 April 1966. Both McCartney and Harrison had been baptised in the Roman Catholic Church, but neither of them followed Christianity. In his interview with Cleave, Harrison was also outspoken about organised religion, as well as the Vietnam War and authority figures in general, whether \\"religious or secular\\". He said: \\"If Christianity's as good as they say it is, it should stand up to a bit of discussion.\\" According to author Steve Turner, the British satirical magazine Private Eye responded to Lennon's comments by featuring a cover by cartoonist Gerald Scarfe that showed him \\"dressed in heavenly robes and playing a cross-shaped guitar with a halo made out of a vinyl LP\\". Response in the US Newsweek made reference to Lennon's \\"more popular than Jesus\\" comments in an issue published in March, and the interview had appeared in Detroit magazine in May. On 3 July, Cleave's four Beatles interviews were published together in a five-page article in The New York Times Magazine, titled \\"Old Beatles – A Study in Paradox\\". None of these provoked a strong reaction. =Datebook= The September 1966 \\"Shout-Out\\" issue of Datebook magazine that sparked the controversy Beatles press officer Tony Barrow offered the four interviews to Datebook, an American teen magazine. He believed that the pieces were important to show fans that the Beatles were progressing beyond simple pop music and producing more intellectually challenging work. Datebook was a liberal magazine that addressed subjects such as interracial dating and legalisation of marijuana, so it seemed an appropriate publication for the interviews. Managing editor Danny Fields played a role in shining a spotlight on Lennon's comments. Datebook published the Lennon and McCartney interviews on 29 July, in its September \\"Shout-Out\\" issue dedicated to controversial youth-orientated themes including recreational drugs, sex, long hair and the Vietnam War. Art Unger, the magazine's editor, put a quote from Lennon's interview on the cover: \\"I don't know which will go first – rock 'n' roll or Christianity!\\" In author Robert Rodriguez's description, the editor had chosen Lennon's \\"most damning comment\\" for maximum effect; placed above it on the cover was a quote from McCartney regarding America: \\"It's a lousy country where anyone black is a dirty nigger!\\" Only McCartney's image was featured on the front cover, as Unger expected that his statement would spark the most controversy. The same Lennon quote appeared as the headline above the feature article. Beside the text, Unger included a photo of Lennon on a yacht, gazing across the ocean with his hand shielding his eyes, accompanied by the caption: \\"John Lennon sights controversy and sets sail directly towards it. That's the way he likes to live!\\" =Escalation and radio bans= In late July, Unger sent copies of the interviews to radio stations in the American South. WAQY disc jockey Tommy Charles in Birmingham, Alabama heard about Lennon's remarks from his co- presenter Doug Layton and said, \\"That does it for me. I am not going to play the Beatles any more.\\" During their 29 July breakfast show, Charles and Layton asked for listeners' views on Lennon's comment, and the response was overwhelmingly negative. The pair set about destroying Beatles vinyl LPs on- air. Charles later stated, \\"We just felt it was so absurd and sacrilegious that something ought to be done to show them that they can't get away with this sort of thing.\\" United Press International bureau manager Al Benn heard the WAQY show and filed a news report in New York City, culminating in a major story in The New York Times on 5 August. Sales of Datebook, which had never been a leading title in the youth magazine market beforehand, reached a million copies. Lennon's remarks were deemed blasphemous by some right-wing religious groups. More than 30 radio stations, including some in New York and Boston, followed WAQY's lead by refusing to play the Beatles' music. WAQY hired a tree-grinding machine and invited listeners to deliver their Beatles merchandise for destruction. KCBN in Reno, Nevada broadcast hourly editorials condemning the Beatles and announced a public bonfire for 6 August where the band's albums would be burned. Several Southern stations organised demonstrations with bonfires, drawing crowds of teenagers to publicly burn their Beatles records, effigies of the band, and other memorabilia. Photos of teenagers eagerly participating in the bonfires were widely distributed throughout the US, and the controversy received blanket media coverage through television reports. The furore came to be known as the \\"'More popular than Jesus' controversy\\" or the \\"Jesus controversy\\". It followed soon after the negative reaction from American disc jockeys and retailers to the \\"butcher\\" sleeve photo used on the Beatles' US-only LP Yesterday and Today. Withdrawn and replaced within days of release in June, this LP cover showed the band members dressed as butchers and covered in dismembered plastic dolls and pieces of raw meat. For some conservatives in the American South, according to Rodriguez, Lennon's comments on Christ now allowed them an opportunity to act on their grievances against the Beatles – namely, their long hair and championing of African-American musicians. =Pre-tour press conferences= According to Unger, Brian Epstein was initially unperturbed about the reaction from the Birmingham disc jockeys, telling him: \\"Arthur, if they burn Beatles records, they've got to buy them first.\\" Within days, however, Epstein became so concerned by the furore that he considered cancelling the group's upcoming US tour, fearing that they would be seriously harmed in some way. He flew to New York on 4 August and held a press conference the following day in which he claimed that Datebook had taken Lennon's words out of context, and expressed regret on behalf of the group that \\"people with certain religious beliefs should have been offended in any way\\". Epstein's efforts had little effect, as the controversy quickly spread beyond the United States. In Mexico City, there were demonstrations against the Beatles, and a number of countries banned the Beatles' music on national radio stations, including South Africa and Spain. The Vatican issued a denouncement of Lennon's comments, saying that \\"Some subjects must not be dealt with profanely, not even in the world of beatniks.\\" This international disapproval was reflected in the share price of the Beatles' Northern Songs publishing company, which dropped by the equivalent of 28 cents on the London Stock Exchange. In response to the furore in the US, a Melody Maker editorial stated that the \\"fantastically unreasoned reaction\\" supported Lennon's statement regarding Christ's disciples being \\"thick and ordinary\\". Daily Express columnist Robert Pitman wrote, \\"It seems a nerve for Americans to hold up shocked hands, when week in, week out, America is exporting to us [in Britain] a subculture that makes the Beatles seem like four stern old churchwardens.\\" The reaction was also criticised within the US; a Kentucky radio station announced that it would give the Beatles music airplay to show its \\"contempt for hypocrisy personified\\", and the Jesuit magazine America wrote that \\"Lennon was simply stating what many a Christian educator would readily admit.\\" Jim Stagg of the Chicago station WCFL in August 1966 The Beatles left London on 11 August for their US tour. Lennon's wife Cynthia said that he was nervous and upset because he had made people angry simply by expressing his opinion. The Beatles held a press conference in Barrow's suite at the Astor Tower Hotel in Chicago. Lennon did not want to apologise but was advised by Epstein and Barrow that he should. Lennon was also distressed that he had potentially endangered the lives of his bandmates by speaking his mind. While preparing to meet the reporters, he broke down in tears in front of Epstein and Barrow. To present a more conservative image for the cameras, the Beatles eschewed their London fashions for dark suits, plain shirts, and neckties. At the press conference, Lennon said: \\"I suppose if I had said television was more popular than Jesus, I would have got away with it. I'm sorry I opened my mouth. I'm not anti-God, anti-Christ, or anti- religion. I was not knocking it. I was not saying we are greater or better.\\" He stressed that he had been remarking on how other people viewed and popularised the Beatles. He described his own view of God by quoting the Bishop of Woolwich, \\"not as an old man in the sky. I believe that what people call God is something in all of us.\\" He was adamant that he was not comparing himself with Christ, but attempting to explain the decline of Christianity in the UK. \\"If you want me to apologise,\\" he concluded, \\"if that will make you happy, then OK, I'm sorry.\\" Journalists gave a sympathetic response and told Lennon that people in the Bible Belt were \\"quite notorious for their Christian attitude\\". Placated by Lennon's gesture, Tommy Charles cancelled WAQY's Beatles bonfire, which had been planned for 19 August, when the Beatles were due to perform in the South. The Vatican's newspaper L'Osservatore Romano announced that the apology was sufficient, while a New York Times editorial similarly stated that the matter was over, but added, \\"The wonder is that such an articulate young man could have expressed himself imprecisely in the first place.\\" In a private meeting with Unger, Epstein asked him to surrender his press pass for the tour, saying that it had been a \\"bad idea\\" for Unger to publish the interviews, and to avoid accusations that Datebook and the Beatles' management had orchestrated the controversy as a publicity stunt. Epstein assured him that there would be better publishing opportunities for the magazine if he \\"voluntarily\\" withdrew from the tour. Unger refused and, in his account, received Lennon's full support when he later discussed the meeting with him. =US tour incidents= An audience member set off a firework on stage during the Beatles' performance at Mid-South Coliseum in Memphis on 19 August. The tour was initially marred by protests and disturbances, and an undercurrent of tension. On 13 August, when the band played in Detroit, images were published of members of the South Carolina Ku Klux Klan \\"crucifying\\" a Beatles record on a large wooden cross, which they then ceremoniously burned. That night, the Texas radio station KLUE held a large Beatles bonfire, only for a lightning bolt to strike its transmission tower the following day and send the station temporarily off-air. The Beatles received telephone threats, and the Ku Klux Klan picketed their concerts in Washington, DC and Memphis, Tennessee. The latter was the tour's only stop in the Deep South and was expected to be a flashpoint for the controversy. Two concerts took place there at the Mid-South Coliseum on 19 August, although the city council had voted to cancel them rather than have \\"municipal facilities be used as a forum to ridicule anyone's religion\\", adding that \\"the Beatles are not welcome in Memphis\\". An ITN news team sent from London to cover the controversy for the program Reporting '66 held interviews with Charles and with teenagers in Birmingham, many of whom were critical of the Beatles. ITN reporter Richard Lindley also interviewed Robert Shelton, the Ku Klux Klan's Imperial Wizard, who condemned the band for supporting civil rights and said they were communists. Coinciding with the band's visit to Memphis, local preacher Jimmy Stroad held a Christian rally to \\"give the youth of the mid- South an opportunity to show Jesus Christ is more popular than the Beatles\\". Outside the Coliseum, a young Klansman told a TV reporter that the Klan were a \\"terror organization\\" and would use their \\"ways and means\\" to stop the Beatles performing. During the evening show, an audience member threw a firecracker onto the stage, leading the band to believe that they were the target of gunfire. At press conferences later in the tour, Lennon attempted to avoid the subject of his \\"Jesus\\" comments, reasoning that no further discussion was necessary. Rather than shying away from controversy, however, the Beatles became increasingly vocal about topical issues such as the Vietnam War. In Toronto on 17 August, Lennon expressed his approval of Americans who evaded the draft by crossing the border into Canada. At their New York press conference on 22 August, the Beatles shocked reporters by emphatically condemning the Vietnam War as \\"wrong\\". The Beatles hated the tour, partly due to the controversy and adverse reaction to Lennon's comments, and they were unhappy about Epstein continuing to organise live performances that were increasingly at odds with their studio work. The controversy had also overshadowed the American release of their 1966 album Revolver, which the band considered to be their best and most mature musical work yet. Following the tour, Harrison contemplated leaving the group, but he decided to remain on the condition that the Beatles would focus solely on studio recording. They took a break and reconvened in November 1966 to begin recording Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which was a major success when released in June 1967. Legacy In 1993, Michael Medved wrote in The Sunday Times that \\"today, comments like Lennon's could never cause controversy; a contemptuous attitude to religion is all but expected from all mainstream pop performers.\\" In 1997, Noel Gallagher claimed that his band Oasis was \\"bigger than God\\", but reaction was minimal. Writing for Mojo magazine in 2002, David Fricke credited Cleave's Lennon interview and the \\"More popular than Jesus\\" controversy as marking the start of modern music journalism. He said that it was \\"no coincidence\\" that Paul Williams, a seventeen-year-old Swarthmore College student, launched America's first serious rock publication, Crawdaddy!, in 1966, given the Beatles' influence and Lennon's \\"sense of mission\\" as a spokesman for youth culture. Lennon's comments continued to be the subject of scrutiny in right- wing religious literature, particularly in the writing of David Noebel, a longstanding critic of the Beatles' influence on American youth. According to a 1987 article by Mark Sullivan in the journal Popular Music, a photo from WAYX's Beatles bonfire in Waycross, Georgia, which shows a child presenting the Meet the Beatles! LP for burning, became \\"Probably the most famous photograph of the entire anti-rock movement\\". In 2012, Nathan Smith of the Houston Press compared several aspects of popular media and concluded that Jesus was more popular than the Beatles. In 2015, Philippine Star contributor Edgar O. Cruz said that Lennon's statement proved to be at least half-wrong, reporting that \\"rock 'n roll is dead but Christianity expanded with Catholicism experiencing exceptional growth through Pope Francis' lead\\". According to Steve Turner, the episode became \\"so much a part of history\\" that the words \\"More popular than Jesus\\" are synonymous with the 1966 controversy. =Lennon's life and career= Lennon with wife Yoko Ono during their 1969 Bed-Ins for Peace in Amsterdam Former Beatles press officer Derek Taylor referred to the controversy in a late 1966 article for the Los Angeles Times West: \\"I'm seriously worried about someone with a rifle. After all, there's no Kennedy anymore; but you can always shoot John Lennon.\\" Lennon repeated his opinion that the Beatles were more influential on young people than Christ during a trip to Canada in 1969, adding that some ministers had agreed with him. He called the American protestors \\"fascist Christians\\", saying that he was \\"very big on Christ\\" and \\"I've always fancied him. He was right.\\" In 1978, he said that, if he had not made the \\"more popular\\" comment, \\"I might still be up there with all the other performing fleas! God bless America. Thank you, Jesus.\\" In May 1968, Lennon announced at a meeting held at the Beatles' Apple Corps headquarters that he was the living reincarnation of Christ. The meeting was adjourned for lunch and Lennon never mentioned the subject again. In May 1969, the band released \\"The Ballad of John and Yoko\\" as a single, with Lennon singing the lines, \\"Christ, you know it ain't easy, you know how hard it can be / The way things are going, they're gonna crucify me.\\" Lennon called himself \\"one of Christ's biggest fans\\" during a BBC interview at the time. He also talked about the Church of England, his vision of heaven, and unhappiness over being unable to marry Yoko Ono in church as a divorcee. In December 1969, Lennon was asked whether he would play the part of Jesus in Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's new musical Jesus Christ Superstar. Lennon had no interest in the part, although he said that he would have been interested if Ono could play the part of Mary Magdalene. In his 1970 song \\"God\\", Lennon sang that he did not believe in Jesus, the Bible, Buddha, the Gita, nor the Beatles. Critics of Lennon's lyrics have focused on the line \\"imagine there's no heaven\\" from his 1971 song \\"Imagine\\". Lennon was murdered on 8 December 1980 by Mark David Chapman, who had become a Christian in 1970 and was incensed by Lennon's \\"more popular than Jesus\\" remark, calling it blasphemy. Chapman stated that he was further enraged by the songs \\"God\\" and \\"Imagine\\", and altered the latter's lyric to \\"imagine John Lennon dead\\". =Vatican response= In 2008, the Vatican's L'Osservatore Romano published an article marking the 40th anniversary of the Beatles' self-titled album (also known as the \\"White Album\\") which included comments on the \\"more popular than Jesus\\" remark. Part of the response read: \\"The remark ... which triggered deep indignation, mainly in the United States, after many years sounds only like a 'boast' by a young working-class Englishman faced with unexpected success, after growing up in the legend of Elvis and rock and roll.\\" Starr responded: \\"Didn't the Vatican say we were possibly Satanic, and they've still forgiven us? I think the Vatican's got more to talk about than the Beatles.\\" See also *Religion in the United Kingdom *Religion in the United States *Religious views of the Beatles Notes References Citations Sources        * External links * Lennon's full \\"How Does a Beatle Live?\\" interview at Rock's Backpages Category:History of the Beatles More popular than Jesus Category:Christianity in popular culture controversies Category:Censorship in the arts Category:1966 in music Category:1966 controversies Category:1966 in Christianity Category:Criticism of Christianity Category:Obscenity controversies in music Category:English phrases Category:Words and phrases introduced in 1966 Category:Quotations from music ","title":"More popular than Jesus"},{"id":"3418469","text":"The collection of hymns called Sohila is repeated at bedtime by Sikhs.

However, by the start of the first session in November 1902 there were ten postulants. The arrival of the additional personnel fueled support for the construction of a new building that could serve as both a dormitory and classroom. However, in June 1903, a fire destroyed St Stanislaus College and with it the hopes for the new building. The Brothers could afford to make only patchwork repairs and they had to assume the roles of blacksmiths and carpenters in order to repair damaged farm equipment and property. They also had to instigate cost-cutting measures, one of which involved the heating of the various buildings. Coal was used to heat only the main building, while stoves in the other buildings were fueled by railroad ties. The novices had to transport and handsaw the ties during their leisure time. The greatest asset to the novitiate was the farm. The community could afford only things such as meat, bread, coffee and sugar. The rest had to be grown. The novices and postulants worked on the farm both in their free time and on scheduled work rotations. A common recreational activity of the residents was fishing on nearby Woodburn Pond. =Education of novices= The arrival of sixteen novices from France caused overcrowding. Due to the community's budget constraints, they were forced to improve on their facilities in piecemeal fashion. The first true expansion of the novitiate occurred in 1907 when the main house was renovated. It was determined that a new chapel was needed in order to handle the number of inhabitants. A new building would have been too expensive and so it was decided to add a new wing. Three years later, the main house underwent another refurbishment. The top floor was refitted as a dormitory, while dining and recreation rooms were added to the lower level. Outside, the carriage house that held the novices was moved and a small cottage was placed adjacent to the main building. Not all the changes were strictly practical. The community was concerned about the appearance of the grounds and after the addition of the new wing in 1907, a marble statue of Saint Joseph, weighing , was installed in front of the building. =The community expands= During the early 1920s, various fund-raising events provided the necessary capital to begin construction of a proper chapel. This was formally opened in 1922. At the dedication ceremony, the Bishop of Trenton, Thomas J. Walsh, asked the Brothers to take control of the Cathedral High School in Trenton. In 1924 construction of what is now known as O'Neil Hall was completed. The building, designed by the same architect who had created the chapel, provided recreation rooms, kitchens and dining rooms, science labs, several classrooms and a large dormitory. In 1951, a proposal was made to move the novitiate to Blairstown but failed due to lack of funding. Ten years later, the novitiate moved to Belvidere. This resolved the problem of overcrowding and enabled the separation of the novitiate from the postulant programs, as had been originally envisaged by the Province. =Founding of the high school= With the newfound space, the Brothers decided to establish a high school and in the fall of 1961 admitted 150 ninth grade students. A high school grew out of the old postulant program, which had existed for some time. The building was constructed on the land occupied by Brother Fabian's vineyard that had been planted about sixty years before. The building was completed in 1963 at a cost of US$1 million. The school soon developed high academic standards. The class of 1965 had two national merit scholarship semi-finalists, the first of many students in this category.

The case for Smith stated that he was fired due to age discrimination and over claims that he was involved in tuition payments for student-athletes, of which he denies involvement.

He served under the second Wu emperor, Sun Liang. Life Sun Jun was a great-grandson of Sun Jing, an uncle of Wu's founding emperor Sun Quan. Late in Sun Quan's reign, he became a trusted personal assistant of Sun Quan's, and he was said to have been, in conjunction with Sun Quan's daughter Sun Luban, involved in falsely accusing the crown prince Sun He, leading to Sun He's deposal in 250. At his and Sun Luban's recommendation, Sun Quan created his youngest son Sun Liang as his successor. Again at Sun Jun's recommendation, Sun Quan named Zhuge Ke regent for Sun Liang in 251, and after his death in 252, Sun Jun became a key assistant to Zhuge. In 253, after Zhuge Ke had suffered a major military defeat to Wu's rival state, Cao Wei, and subsequently refused to admit fault but instead tried to wipe out all dissent, Sun Jun assassinated him and took over as regent. There was initial anticipation that he might be willing to share power with other key officials, but he instead consolidated power into his own hands. He was not known for his accomplishments during his regency, and he was severe in his punishments. As a result, there were several conspiracies against his life during his regency, including one in 254 led by Sun Ying (孫英), the Marquis of Wu, the son of Sun Quan's eldest son Sun Deng, and one in 255, which Sun Luban (with whom Sun Jun might have had an affair) falsely accused her sister Sun Luyu of being the leader of, and Sun Jun had Sun Luyu executed. In 256, at the urging of Wen Qin, a Wei general who had surrendered to Wu after a rebellion of his and Guanqiu Jian's failed, Sun Jun considered launching a major attack against Wei, but as he was about to do so, he grew ill. He transferred his powers to his cousin Sun Chen and then died. Sun Chen succeeded him. In 258, after Sun Chen had deposed Sun Liang and had in turn been executed by the succeeding emperor Sun Xiu, Sun Jun's casket was disinterred and reduced in size, as a sign of imperial disapproval; both Sun Jun and Sun Chen were posthumously banished from the royal family and renamed Gu Jun (故峻) and Gu Chen (故綝) respectively.(休耻与峻、綝同族。特除其属籍，称之曰故峻、故綝云。) Sanguozhi vol. 64.

Pellegrino (born 1953) is an American writer, the author of several books related to science and archaeology, including Return to Sodom and Gomorrah, Ghosts of the Titanic, Unearthing Atlantis, and Ghosts of Vesuvius. Pellegrino falsely claimed to have earned a PhD, and errors in his book The Last Train from Hiroshima (2010) prompted its publisher to withdraw it within a few months of publication. Early life During the mid-1970s, Pellegrino earned bachelor's and master's degrees at Long Island University. Controversies =Ghosts of the Titantic= In a scathing review of Ghosts of the Titantic (2000) in The New York Times, Michael Parfit wrote: \\"If Charles Pellegrino weren't so shamelessly self-promoting, it might be O.K. to let this book drift into oblivion past the icebergs that it ought to hit. But he quotes himself in epigraphs, invents friendships with famous people and claims scientific authority for a work that flouts most principles of scientific scholarship. He shouldn't get away with it.\\" Parfit's final paragraph begins: \\"Pellegrino has an agile mind, which has carried him through books on Atlantis, Sodom and Gomorrah and the lunar module. What's sad about all this is that if he hadn't claimed authority that isn't his, had checked his facts more carefully and had more honestly labeled his reconstructions and speculations as imaginative, the book might have had promise.\\" =Last Train from Hiroshima= In January 2010, Henry Holt published Pellegrino's Last Train from Hiroshima, a look at the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima from the vantage of survivors. The New York Times initially praised the book as \\"sober and authoritative\\" and as a \\"firm and compelling synthesis of earlier memoirs and archival material\\". Nevertheless, a month later the New York Times questioned claims made in Pellegrino's book: Veterans of the 509th Operations Group, the Air Force unit which dropped the atomic bombs, issued a detailed list of substantive problems with many of the book's claims about the bomb and the Air Force personnel involved. The New York Times added, \\"Facing a national outcry and the Corliss family’s evidence, the author, Charles Pellegrino, now concedes that he was probably duped. . . . [H]e said he would rewrite sections of the book for paperback and foreign editions.\\" Despite Pellegrino's claim in The New York Times that he had been \\"duped\\" by Fuoco, further investigation revealed that Pellegrino had repeatedly mentioned one of the book's most disputed claims (a supposedly fatal accident at Tinian Island on 4 August 1945) before Mr. Fuoco had allegedly confided it for him. Doubts also arose about the existence of two westerners allegedly present in Hiroshima at the time of the bombing. On 1 March 2010, Henry Holt announced it had halted publication of Last Train from Hiroshima. Pellegrino subsequently revised the text to remove some of the disputed content. The book was retitled \\"To Hell and Back\\" and released by a different publisher in 2015. =Doctoral degree= Pellegrino claimed to have received a PhD in 1982 from Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand. Victoria University denied that claim. Pellegrino responded that the university had \\"stripped him of his Ph.D. because of a disagreement over evolutionary theory\\". The New Zealand Herald reported that Pellegrino claimed his credentials had been restored by 1997. The university investigated the matter, and in 2010, The New York Times reported: Works The Jesus Family Tomb: The Discovery, the Investigation, and the Evidence That Could Change History (2007) (co-authored with Simcha Jacobovici) was a companion book to the Discovery Channel documentary on the same subject created in part by film director James Cameron.

The line links the town of Lugano with Ponte Tresa, and is long. It is built to metre gauge ( gauge), and is electrified on the overhead system at 1200 volts DC. It is operated by the Ferrovie Luganesi company.This article incorporates information from the revision as of March 2, 2009 of the equivalent article on the German Wikipedia. The FLP opened in 1912 and is the last working line of an interconnected network including two other suburban lines, the Lugano–Tesserete railway and the Lugano–Cadro–Dino railway, and the urban tramways of Lugano. There are proposals to extend the line back into some of the areas formerly covered by this network. The FLP is a member of the Arcobaleno tariff network and operates as line S60 of the Rete celere del Canton Ticino. Trains run every 15 minutes on weekdays and every 30 minutes on weekends.  History  Share of the Società Ferrovie Luganesi, issued 18. April 1911 The first proposal for a railway between Lugano and Ponte Tresa dates back to 1877, when a standard gauge line was proposed with the expectation it would be extended to Varese in Italy. However nothing was done until 1910, when the Ferrovie Luganesi company was founded to construct a narrow gauge electric railway between the two towns. The line opened in 1912, and had a rolling stock comprising three motor cars, three passenger trailers and six freight cars. At Lugano station, a link track connected to the adjacent Lugano–Tesserete railway, allowing transfer of rolling stock. In 1949 and 1964, new routings were introduced in Ponte Tresa and east of Bioggio respectively. In 1968, three new articulated electric trains were introduced, but these were transferred to the Società Subalpina Imprese Ferroviarie in 1978, when they were replaced by five new twin-car trains. In the same year a regular interval timetable, with trains every 20 minutes, was introduced. In 1979, Magliaso station was rebuilt in collaboration with the PTT. Between 1990 and 1992, Agno station and Lugano FLP station were both renovated and expanded. In 2001, a new Bioggio Molinazzo station was constructed. In 2002, five new low floor centre carriages were acquired, and used to expand the 1978 twin-car units into three car units. Between 2004 and 2007, significant upgrading work was undertaken in order to allow the introduction of 15 minute interval service. This included the doubling of the track in the Magliaso and Bioggio areas, and expanding Magliaso station and Cappella-Agnuzzo station.  Operation  One of the three original motor cars, still in service in 1978. One of the current Be4/12 sets with low floor centre car. Note the 'smile'. The FLP platforms at Lugano. To the left is one of the Be4/8 units kept in reserve. Ponte Tresa station and sidings, with car park above. The line is long and links Lugano station, also served by the Gotthard line, and Ponte Tresa station. Trains run every 15 minutes on weekdays and every 30 minutes on weekends, with a running time of 25 minutes. In normal service, trains pass in the stations of Cappella-Agnuzzo, Serocca and Magliaso. Other stations served are Sorengo, Sorengo Laghetto, Bioggio Molinazzo, Bioggio, Agno, Magliaso Paese and Caslano. Most services are provided by five Be4/12 sets, numbered 21-25 and made up of the 1978-built twin-car sets strengthened with a 2002-built low-floor intermediate car. The line also possesses two 1979-built Be4/8 twin-car sets, number 41-42 and purchased second hand from Ferrovie Autolinee Regionali Ticinesi, which are kept in reserve. A Tm2/2 diesel locomotive is used for works duties. Cars are painted in an orange and cream colour scheme, with a distinctive stylised smile on the front. The line is built to metre gauge ( gauge), and is electrified on the overhead system at 1200 volts DC. The workshops are adjacent to Agno station, but trains are stabled at both termini. There is also a permanent way siding at Bioggio Molinazzo station.

The Goalpariya is the most commonly spoken dialect of Assamese in the town. Places to visit The notable places to visit in and around Goalpara are: *Shyamrai Sattra : Shyamrai Sattra, the center of Vaishnavite culture of Srimanta Sankardeva, was established in Goalpara about 366 years ago. In the preliminary stages, the Sattra was managed by two brothers named Late Raghu Medhi and Late Kush Medhi. Subsequently, the people of Goalpara assembled there and decided to permanently establish the Sattra. They approached the Meshpara Estate Zamindar, who in turn, allotted 8 bighas of land in the center of the town for the establishment of the Sattra. Since then, the Sattra has continuously observed all formalities and aspects of Vaishnav culture. Regular 'Nam Prasanga', etc. are held in coordination with the observance of the yearly religious festivals. 'Thiyo Naam / Paal Naam Competition' is organised every year and groups come from all over Assam come to participate. One of the most important aspects of the Sattra is that the Sattra authority has preserved the 'Asthi' of Srimanta Sankardeva, which is exhibited in the Sattra campus during Sankar Jayanti period i.e., in the month of Sukla Dasami (during September–October). *Sree Chaitanya Gaudiya Math : It was established at Goalpara in 1969 in order to protect, preserve and expand Sri Krishna Chaitanya culture in the area on a donated plot of land in the center of the town. Regular 'Puja Sangkirtan', etc. are held in the Math in addition to the observance of the religious festivals, as per the Sri Chaitanya Calendar. A large number of devotees from different parts of Assam visit the Math regularly. During important annual festivals, devotees from different parts of the country, including foreigners, visit the Math. *Pir Majhar : The 'Majhar' (tomb) of Hazarat Sayed Abul Kasem Kharasani is situated at the heart of Goalpara. The Muslim graveyard grew around the \\"MAJHAR\\". Every year, 'Uros- Mubarak' is observed here which marks the anniversary of the death of the Pir which is attended by thousands of people from across different religions. The saint Sayed Abul Kasem was a resident of Kherasan and he was born at a place called Fatima Killa. He had set off on a spiritual journey to India and eventually reached Rangpur, which is now in Bangladesh. He used to visit Goalpara frequently to spread his spiritual teachings. *Hulukanda Pahar : It is a hill located on the bank of the Brahmaputra. *Sri Surya Pahar : Sri Surya Pahar, located about 12 km southeast of Goalpara town and about 136 km northwest of Guwahati, is a significant but relatively unknown archaeological site in Assam, India. The site is centered on the hills (Pahar) of Sri Surya, which is profusely filled up with Shiva Lingas Lingam. The popular belief is that 99,999 Shiva Lingas were engraved here by Vyasa in order to build up a second Kashi (where there were 100,000 Shiva Lingas), and once it was one of the holiest pilgrimage sites in the region. The site has the distinction of possessing valuable cultural remains of three important religions of India, i.e. Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism. *Paglatek Shiv Mandir : This is a renowned Shiva Temple situated at Barbhita, near Pancharatna, about 7 km from Goalpara Town. Many devotes visit this temple during the 'Mela'. *Nandeswar Devalaya : Nandeswar Devalaya is one of the oldest devalayas (Shiva Temple) established on the top of Nandeswar hill which stands by the side of river Dudhnoi. There is reason to believe that the temple was established in the 10th or 11th century AD. Shivaratri, Durga Puja and Dol jatra festivals are celebrated in the temple. *Tukreswari :Tukreswari Temple is also a famous religious spot located by the side of National Highways 37 at Tukura about 15 KM from Goalpara Town. As per religious faith a portion of (TUKURA) the Goddess Sati fell in this place and therefore the temple is known as Tukreswari. Two temples are there at the top of Tukreswari hill, one is a Shiva Temple and the other is known as JOYA- VIJOYA Temple.

Aerotrims were used in gyms during the 1980s, but are currently out of production outside of professional applications. A handful of machines are still in circulation, largely used for entertainment at fairs and events and as science fiction showpieces in movies and television. Several companies around the world have picked up the idea and produced their own version with slight changes. One of the originals, made in Korea, can be found in Slovenia at Aerotrim Ekopool Celje. History Mrs. Angie Dittrich as trainer in one of the first Aerotrims. The earliest patents for gimballed devices built to carry humans date to 1907 (Patent #846925Patent #846925). There were several attempts to make similar machines over the next 80 years by various inventors. Several of them, such as the 1907 and the 1920 version, are rectangular in shape. However, the first patent application for a round-frame human gimbal set was made in July 1964 (Patent #3141669Patent #3141669). The Aerotrim, as it is known today, was originally conceived of in the early eighties by Helmut Suchy, an Austrian inventor, as a therapy for his ailing spine (Patent #4799667Patent #Patent #4799667). Friends suggested its potential for use in gyms and hospitals. Suchy built the first prototype in his garage, attached to the walls, but it lacked general safety precautions and a decent foot attachment mechanism, and only people of a certain height could ride it. After signing a profit sharing agreement, Mr. Suchy, after unsuccessfully applying for a patent in Austria, transferred the rights to German entrepreneur Hermann Dittrich, whose import-export company Contactos Trading, GmbH, at great cost, applied internationally for a patent. Mr. Dittrich also chose the name Aerotrim over Suchy’s original 3D-Fun. To make the device safer, he added handles, overhead hand protectors made of Plexiglas, and the height-adjustable foot mechanism that allowed even children (of a minimum height) to use the machine. As a result, it passed even the German Technischer Überwachungsverein (TÜV) safety inspections. Contactos then looked worldwide for manufacturers. Aerotrims began production in Germany, Korea, Taiwan and the United States, where negotiations began to form a company named “Gyrotec” with the renowned US ski manufacturer Hart Ski Company and other investors. Contactos personally launched its own ad campaign, first in Germany, then expanding globally over the next few years. The idea Contrary to the initial appearance, the Aerotrim is not a close-your-eyes-and- hold-on machine and does not cause dizziness or nausea if it is controlled by the rider themselves. Like a dumbbell or bicycle, human strength is required to direct the motions by shifting the rider's body. During a forward or backward spin, command of the machine becomes limited, but it is still possible to flip out of a spinning loop and translate the momentum from forward motion to a sideways, backwards, horizontal or vertical spin. It is the only stationary exercise machine known to have the ability to move into any direction by counterbalance alone. It is this control, or \\"wheeling\\", that requires every muscle in the body to be used evenly, even those not usually targeted by weight training or general cardiovascular exercise.Human Gyroscopes In addition, according to Randy Huntington, a personal athletic coach, \\"One major advantage that the 'superstar' possesses is a highly evolved spatial consciousness and kinesthetic response mechanism. The Aerotrim is an excellent choice for athletes seeking to safely develop these often overlooked attributes.\\" Dr John White, of the London, England Institute of Higher Education stated \\"It's not a gimmick, it's a very serious and important way of training... it's been particularly useful in blind people and also people with severe physical handicaps. It builds confidence, it allows them to work out in a totally new way, one they haven't experienced before.\\" Anthony Amado of the U.S. Olympic Wrestling Team said \\"The Aerotrim has been beneficial in my training for the national team trials.\\" The spinning motion gives a feeling of weightlessness and it is this feeling that can cause a healthy addiction. Douglas Raymond, a physical therapist stated \\"There is no question that the Aerotrim improves balance, coordination and spatial awareness in neurological disorders. The clinician is able to move the patients through all the planes either passively or actively.\\" Regular users, colloquially known as Wheelers or Aeronauts, began to devise and name moves and routines, sometimes in synchrony with two or more machines. Going to Hollywood As soon as it hit television in Germany the Aerotrim was often featured and used as a prop in movies, television series, commercials and even as a prize in game shows. On American television, it had been presented as a prop in several commercials, followed by sci-fi themed shows and movies, including Fortress, Gattaca, The Lawnmower Man (where it is called cyclosphere; however, it has been argued by purists that the machine featured here was only influenced by the Aerotrim) and more recently aboard Star Trek: Enterprise.See Enterprise episode \\"Vanishing Point\\", Season 2, Episode 10. Commander Tucker can be seen using an Aerotrim in the gymnasium. Influence on the 80s Its large size and appearance made it an instant crowd pleaser, drawing masses in all its public appearances. It was readily featured in the general media, often in feature stories and cover pages, which is why it enjoyed a worldwide exposure. Its size and retail price made it unreachable for most private owners and it was only large gyms, hospitals and even freestyle-ski resorts that acquired it, often several at once. If a giant leap from gym equipment to toy, it was a small step to space. It did not take long for the aeronautical community to see its value for equilibrium and weightlessness exercise. An entire fleet was acquired by Lufthansa, another by the Korean air force and several were used by the German space agency for astronaut training.http://www.weltderwunder.de/wdw/RaumfahrtWelt/SpaceCamp/SpaceCamp2005/2_Mission/index.html?ID=nav_r_f civilian training programsDie Pannen mit der Raumfaehre schrecken Astronauten nicht ab – Bonner Rundschau, Dienstag, 23. Oktober 1990 Most European astronauts that have gone to MIR used the Aerotrim for preparation. Soon the myth emerged that the Aerotrim was originally developed to prepare astronauts for weightlessness.Euroviva - Aerotrim - Spacetrainer - Vermietung This however is obviously inaccurate. To this day ESA uses the machine for its official training programs,ESA - Human Spaceflight and Exploration - Business - Get ready for the space experience as well as part of its public training programs.ISS Full Scale Training  Space  mydays GmbH Variations Several variations of the original were produced, some by Contactos, some by cloners. These include a children’s version (MiniAerotrim), wheelchair versions suitable for use by paraplegics or quadriplegics, as well as motorized versions. Its primary role in sci-fi movies, besides futuristic astronaut- trainer, was as a virtual environment simulator.Futuristic But it was not until the mid-nineties that it actually was used as such. Adding VR goggles and a joystick it could be used to play a few games, but since its motion is controlled by the user, its application for VE simulation was limited. This was changed when a motorized version was introduced, which basically interlocked the Aerotrim and user in a VE. Designed as an entertainment device, this version supported VEs in a head mounted display, 3-D binaural sound spacing and up to two joysticks, with either head tracking or user tracking based on the position of the gimbals. Clone wars Just a year after the launch, the first clones appeared and Contactos, owning worldwide patents by then, saw itself involved in its inaugural patent battle.http://epatras.economie.fgov.be/rechNo.jsp?num=211200&ts;=off&l;=enhttp://patentados.com/invento/aparato- para-ejercicios-fisicos.2.html But the clones kept on coming in the US, Italy, Korea, France, and other countries, trying to avoid the patents by changing the foothold and even the shape (some companies produced square and even decagon shaped clonesSpace Flyer) as well as the firm hip support which alone made the Aerotrim a controllable device. Over the following years international lawyers were hired to handle the various court cases. Contactos basically won all of them, but the legal fees soon outweighed the company’s income from this project and Contactos had to keep on financing it through other business activities. In a final desperate move to save a sinking ship, Contactos passed on rights to an Irish company named Lifeway Ltd.http://www.idaireland.com/ But even this movement could not save it from doom. Soon they too had to cease production. Nearly exactly ten years after its birth, the last true Aerotrim was produced in late 1990 and the patent rights were lost due to lack of interest in keeping them alive.Continuing patent application References * \\"Give Your Wallet a Workout\\".

Despite marrying, their union was in contravention of the Royal Marriages Act 1772 and as such was considered legally void. Consequently, she could not be styled either as the Duchess of Sussex nor a Princess. She was created Duchess of Inverness, in her own right, by Queen Victoria, on 10 April 1840. Early life Cecilia's exact date of birth is not known, although it is around 1789. Her father was Arthur Gore, 2nd Earl of Arran; her mother, Elizabeth née Underwood. She was styled Lady Cecilia Gore at birth, the courtesy title of a daughter of an earl. Marriages Lady Cecilia's first marriage was to Sir George Buggin, in May 1815. The marriage produced no children and Sir George died on 12 April 1825. She later married Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, the sixth son of George III, at Great Cumberland Place, London, on 2 May 1831. The Duke of Sussex had already married Lady Augusta Murray in 1793, but that marriage was annulled in 1794 as it contravened the Royal Marriages Act 1772, which required that all members of the British Royal Family seek permission of the sovereign before marriage. However the Duke of Sussex's second marriage also contravened the Act, making it also legally void. Duchess of Inverness As the marriage was not considered lawful, Lady Cecilia could not take the style and title Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex. Instead she assumed the name \\"Underwood\\", her mother's maiden name, by Royal Licence and was known as Lady Cecilia Underwood. The couple resided at the Duke's apartments in Kensington Palace. However, Lady Cecilia was not accepted as a full member of the British Royal Family. Royal protocol restricted Lady Cecilia from being present at any functions attended by other members of the Royal Family, as she was unable to take a seat beside her husband due to her lower rank. To compensate for this, in 1840 Queen Victoria created her Duchess of Inverness, in her own right, with remainder to the heirs male of her body lawfully begotten. This recognised her husband's subsidiary title of Earl of Inverness. Death The Duke of Sussex died in April 1843 at Kensington Palace and was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. The Duchess of Inverness continued to reside at Kensington Palace until her death thirty years later in August 1873. She was buried next to her second husband. Portrayals Lady Cecilia is portrayed briefly in the 2016 ITV series Victoria, Episode 6 \\"The Queen's Husband\\" by Daisy Goodwin, creator of the series and its main writer. The portion of this episode relative to Lady Cecilia is thus described: \\"Victoria curries favour with her uncle the Duke of Sussex, who is unable to present his wife at court because their morganatic marriage was in violation of the Royal Marriages Act 1772. Although his wife was the daughter of an earl, she was not a member of the royal family.

The name comes from the seven Celtic nations, including Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Brittany, Cornwall, the Isle of Man, and Galicia. The band tours extensively and has played in many diverse venues, from small bars to concert halls. They were previously known as Clan Na Gael, but lost that name due to a trademark dispute. At just that time, they got a huge sponsor, allowing them expanded notoriety.  Band history  Seven Nations started to form in Middleburg High, located in Florida. They would joke around about forming a band in the halls. Eventually they did and named it Seven Nations. Seven Nations got its start in New York City in 1993 as the part-time project of then-bartender McLeod, under the name Clan Na Gael. Lead singer Kirk McLeod states that late 1993 \\"was the first time we added bagpipes to the show,\\" and therefore the origin of the band as it is today. During summers, when McLeod was a child, his parents sent him to a Scottish music camp to learn traditional bagpipe technique. Eventually, McLeod assembled a band from friends in Florida and recruits from Canada to play his songs. The band's original members were Kirk McLeod (vocals, keyboard, guitars and Great Highland Bagpipes), Neil Anderson (vocals, highland and Uilleann bagpipes, Scottish smallpipes, tin whistles and mandolin), Jim Struble (vocals, acoustic and bass guitars) and Nick Watson (vocals, drums and percussion). The band changed its name in 1997 because a Nevada based folk music group was already operating under the same name. Watson left the band in 1997 and was replaced by Ashton Geoghagan. Anderson left the band in 1998, and in 1999 Dan Stacey (fiddle, Canadian step dancing) and Scott Long (highland bagpipes) joined Seven Nations's lineup. Geoghagan left in August 2001 to pursue other interests; he is currently a Paramedic/Captain with Jacksonville Fire Rescue. Geoghagan was replaced by Angelo Christian Miceli in 2001 and remains the drummer today. Watson and Anderson currently play together with former The Bolshoi frontman Trevor Tanner in a new Celtic rock group called Rathkeltair which has done extensive touring up and down the east Coast of the US. Dan Stacey left in December 2007 to pursue a solo career and was replaced by Victor Gagnon. Scott Long left the band shortly after to pursue a career opportunity and was replaced by multi instrumentalist Will MacMorran. In 2005, the original members of Clan Na Gael reunited to produce an album where, in addition to tracks from earlier albums Rain and Thunder, Old Ground and Big Dog, there are six new tracks and two completely original songs recorded in December, 2004. \\"Clan Na Gael: 10 Years On\\".They also played four shows live in New York, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina. The band's current line-up includes Kirk McLeod, Jim \\"Struby\\" Struble, Angelo Christian Miceli (drums), Jon Pilatzke (fiddle), and Brad Green (bagpipes.) The band regularly tours across the US, has appeared on ESPN, CNN World Beat, PBS and CBS, and has sold over 140,000 albums since 1996, without signing to a major label . The band's most successful release to date was And Now It's Come to This, released on Razor & Tie Records in 2002. The album's mainstream rock sound was considered to be a drastic change from the band's traditional style. A recent album, Thanks for Waiting, returns to the acoustic style and does not feature an electric guitar. The band also released a Celtic Rock Tribute to the Cure. Seven Nations latest release is Tales From The Eighth Nation (2014).http://sevennations.com/album/174420/tales-from-the-eighth-nation Kirk McLeod's latest project is KIR (2016), a \\"new original endeavor from Kirk McLeod combining Gaelic, mouth music and cantaracht with popular music in a way that has never been done before.\\" http://sevennations.com/music The band is currently based in Orlando, Florida.  Media  The band has been in the media numerous times, most notably during the Dewar's Scotch campaign ads, which featured a print campaign in over 20 major magazines, as well as use of the Dewar's tour bus during late 1999 to 2002. Also in the media was use of the song \\"Big Yellow Bus\\" off their 2002 album And Now It's Come to This in an episode of a CBS drama, but the episode never aired. PBS also did a feature titled \\"An Evening with Seven Nations\\", which was aired sometime in the late 1990s and is available on VHS. In the early 2000s, ESPN approached them to create the theme for their Extreme Sports show, which airs internationally. Perhaps the most successful media exposure, short of the Dewar's Campaign, was during the XIX Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, Utah where they played in the Torch Lighting Ceremony.

A coinduced topology or final topology makes the given (coinducing) collection of functions continuous to this topological space.  Definition  = The case of just one function = Let X_0, X_1 be sets, f:X_0\\\\to X_1. If \\\\tau_0 is a topology on X_0, then the topology coinduced on X_1 by f is \\\\\\\\{U_1\\\\subseteq X_1  f^{-1}(U_1)\\\\in\\\\tau_0\\\\\\\\}. If \\\\tau_1 is a topology on X_1, then the topology induced on X_0 by f is \\\\\\\\{f^{-1}(U_1)  U_1\\\\in\\\\tau_1\\\\\\\\}. The easy way to remember the definitions above is to notice that finding an inverse image is used in both. This is because inverse image preserves union and intersection. Finding a direct image does not preserve intersection in general. Here is an example where this becomes a hurdle. Consider a set X_0=\\\\\\\\{-2, -1, 1, 2\\\\\\\\} with a topology \\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\{-2, -1\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{1, 2\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\}, a set X_1=\\\\\\\\{-1, 0, 1\\\\\\\\} and a function f:X_0\\\\to X_1 such that f(-2)=-1, f(-1)=0, f(1)=0, f(2)=1. A set of subsets \\\\tau_1=\\\\\\\\{f(U_0)U_0\\\\in\\\\tau_0\\\\\\\\} is not a topology, because \\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\{-1, 0\\\\\\\\}, \\\\\\\\{0, 1\\\\\\\\}\\\\\\\\} \\\\subseteq \\\\tau_1 but \\\\\\\\{-1, 0\\\\\\\\} \\\\cap \\\\\\\\{0, 1\\\\\\\\} otin \\\\tau_1. There are equivalent definitions below. The topology \\\\tau_1 coinduced on X_1 by f is the finest topology such that f is continuous (X_0, \\\\tau_0) \\\\to (X_1, \\\\tau_1). This is a particular case of the final topology on X_1. The topology \\\\tau_0 induced on X_0 by f is the coarsest topology such that f is continuous (X_0, \\\\tau_0) \\\\to (X_1, \\\\tau_1). This is a particular case of the initial topology on X_0. = General case = Given a set X and an indexed family (Yi)i∈I of topological spaces with functions :f_i: X \\\\to Y_i, the topology \\\\tau on X induced by these functions is the coarsest topology on X such that each :f_i: (X,\\\\tau) \\\\to Y_i is continuous. Explicitly, the induced topology is the collection of open sets generated by all sets of the form f_i^{-1}(U), where U is an open set in Y_i for some i ∈ I, under finite intersections and arbitrary unions. The sets f_i^{-1}(U) are often called cylinder sets. If I contains exactly one element, all the open sets of (X,\\\\tau) are cylinder sets.  Examples  * The quotient topology is the topology coinduced by the quotient map. * The product topology is the topology induced by the projections \\\\text{proj}_j : X \\\\to X_j. * If f:X_0\\\\to X is an inclusion map, then f induces on X_0 the subspace topology. * The weak topology is that induced by the dual on a topological vector space.

He was instrumental in organising the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabhandak Committee and guiding the Sikhs during the partition of India, which he strongly opposed. He later led their demand for a Sikh-majority state in Punjab, India. His daughter, the Indian journalist and politician Rajinder Kaur, was killed by Punjab Police in Bathinda.RAJINDER KAUR, DR. (SHRIMATI). Rajya Sabha Council of States  Early life  Singh was born on 24 June 1885 to a Khatri family in Rawalpindi, Punjab Province in British India. Later he became a high school teacher upon his graduation from Khalsa College, Amritsar, in 1907. Singh's career in education was within the Sikh school system and the use of \\"Master\\" as a prefix to his name reflects this period.  Political career  Singh was ardent in his desire to promote and protect the cause of Sikhism. This often put him at odds with civil authorities and he was jailed on 14 occasions for civil disobedience between 1930–1966. Early examples of his support for civil disobedience came through his close involvement with the movement led by Mohandas K. Gandhi. He became a leader of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) political party, which was the major force in Sikh politics, and he was similarly involved with the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (Supreme Committee of Gurdwara Management), an apex body that dealt with the Sikh places of worship known as gurdwaras. = Partition of India = As with other Sikh organisations, Singh and his Shiromani Akali Dal condemned the Lahore Resolution and the movement to create Pakistan, viewing it as welcoming possible persecution; he thus strongly opposed the partition of India, saying that him and his party would fight \\"tooth and nail\\" against the concept of a Pakistan. = In independent India = Singh's most significant cause was the creation of a distinct Punjabi-speaking state. He believed that this would best protect the integrity of Sikh religious and political traditions. He began a hunger strike in 1961 at the Golden Temple in Amritsar, promising to continue it to his death unless the then Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to his demand for such a state. Nehru argued that India was a secular country and the creation of a state based on religious distinction was inappropriate. Nonetheless, Nehru did promise to consider the issue. Singh abandoned his fast after 48 days. Singh's fellow Sikhs turned against him, believing that he had capitulated, and they put him on trial in a court adjudged by pijaras. Singh pleaded guilty to the charges laid against him and found his reputation in tatters. The community felt he had abandoned his ideals and replaced him in the SAD. The linguistic division of the Indian state of Punjab eventually took place in 1966, with the Hindi-speaking areas redesignated as a part of the state of Haryana. Singh himself died in Chandigarh on 22 November 1967.

The sound of Jackson's Rhodes electric piano and flute accompaniments featured prominently in many of their compositions, most notably on \\"The Bottle\\" and \\"Your Daddy Loves You\\" from their first official collaboration Winter in America. Early life Jackson was born on October 11, 1952 to Clarence and Elsie Jackson, respectively a New York State parole officer and a librarian at the Ford Foundation. He spent the first two years of his life in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, later sharing a house in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn with his uncle Howard, wife Dorothy and young cousin Sidney until his parents separated by the time he was five. Unable to take on the responsibility of sharing mortgage payments alone, Elsie was forced to move to a one-bedroom apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn until she remarried in 1968. Jackson studied music in Fort Greene with his mother's childhood teacher, Hepzibah Ross (fondly called 'Aunt Heppie') with whom he took lessons for seven years. When Elsie was unable to continue payments for lessons, Aunt Heppie granted him a scholarship, simply stating that Jackson showed 'great promise.' His mother later married Alvin S.Lovell a General Practitioner from Bedford Stuyvesant who often donated his services to uninsured residents of the community. In 1968, their daughter and Brian's sister, Alison Lovell, was born. From 1965-1969 Jackson attended Brooklyn's Erasmus Hall High School, where he met other musicians and began to form bands on the outside while participating in school music programs. Career Jackson met Gil Scott-Heron while the two were attending Lincoln University (Pennsylvania).Wynn, Ron \\"[ Brian Jackson Biography]\\", Allmusic, retrieved 2010-02-06 They began a decade-long writing, producing, and recording partnership.

(2002) The Great Rock Discography, Canongate, , p. 912-3 with Ron Carter on bass. Other notable albums include Free Will (1972) and Winter in America (1974), which was the first to have Jackson receive co-billing, and which was later described by Barney Hoskyns in UNCUT as \\"a masterwork of ghetto melancholia and stark political gravitas\\".Hoskyns, Barney (2005) \\"Gil Scott-Heron/Brian Jackson: Winter in America (Charly)\\", UNCUT, July 2005 His biggest hit was with Scott-Heron, 1974's \\"The Bottle\\".

Jackson continued to be active in the 1980s and 1990s, working with Earth, Wind & Fire, Stevie Wonder, Will Downing and Gwen Guthrie. Jackson's first solo album, \\"Gotta Play\\" (released October 2000), included guest performances by Roy Ayers and Scott-Heron.

This comic technique may be found in Aristophanes, but the English playwrights Ben Jonson and George Chapman popularised the genre in the closing years of the sixteenth century. In the later half of the seventeenth century, it was combined with the comedy of manners in Restoration comedy. humours' or temperaments (Clockwise from top right; choleric; melancholic; sanguine; phlegmatic). In Jonson’s Every Man in His Humour (acted 1598), which made this type of play popular, all the words and acts of Kitely are controlled by an overpowering suspicion that his wife is unfaithful; George Downright, a country squire, must be \\"frank\\" above all things; the country gull in town determines his every decision by his desire to \\"catch on\\" to the manners of the city gallant. In his Induction to Every Man out of His Humour (1599) Jonson explains his character-formula thus: > Some one peculiar quality > Doth so possess a man, that it doth draw > All his affects, his spirits, and his powers, > In their confluctions, all to run one way. The comedy of humours owes something to earlier vernacular comedy but more to a desire to imitate the classical comedy of Plautus and Terence and to combat the vogue of romantic comedy, as developed by William Shakespeare. The satiric purpose of the comedy of humours and its realistic method lead to more serious character studies with Jonson’s 1610 play The Alchemist. The humours each had been associated with physical and mental characteristics; the result was a system that was quite subtle in its capacity for describing types of personality.

Karmanos is also the minority owner and alternate governor of the Carolina Hurricanes hockey franchise. He served as their principal owner from 1994 (when the Hurricanes were the Hartford Whalers) to 2018. He also owned the Plymouth Whalers junior hockey club from its establishment in 1990 until 2015, and was the majority owner of the Florida Everblades from 1998 to 2019. Early life The oldest of three children, Karmanos Jr. was born in Detroit, Michigan to Greek immigrant parents who owned a small restaurant in Detroit called \\"Pete's\\", where Karmanos waited tables during his high school years. In 1961, Karmanos graduated from Henry Ford High School and would go on to attend Wayne State University. While attending Wayne State University, Karmanos landed an entry-level job at Mechanical Mailing, helping run the company's newly installed IBM mainframe computer. Shortly thereafter, he would be promoted to senior systems analyst. In 1965, Karmanos took a job as a data processing manager at Giffels & Rosetti, a Detroit architectural firm. He would later become vice president of a Minneapolis-based firm, Technalysis, managing its Detroit office. Compuware Corporation In 1973, Karmanos and partners, Thomas Thewes and Allen Cutting, each contributed $3,000 in startup money to found software company Compuware Corporation, with the simple mission to \\"help people do productive things with computers.\\" In 1977, Compuware launched its flagship software product, Abend-AID, a mainframe productivity tool that helped businesses reduce the time and cost associated with running their IT operations. Along with File-AID, a file and data management tool released in 1981 and the company’s thousands of professional services employees, Abend-AID would be used by countless companies around the world across every industry to solve their Y2K issues by programmatically finding and fixing Y2K-related date issues in hundreds of millions of lines of mainframe computer code. With the rise of distributed computing systems and the Internet in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Compuware would expand its solution portfolio to help customers build, test, and manage business applications hosted in these new environments. The company would be known globally as a leading provider of software productivity tools for enterprise- level IT organizations, becoming the largest technology firm in Michigan and one of the largest software companies in the world. Compuware went public in December of 1992 at $22 per share under the ticker symbol “CPWR,” setting a then-record for a tech IPO by raising $207 million. Over the next 15 months, Compuware’s share price would rise to $47 and would reach $79.81 per share in 1999 during the boom of the Y2K era. At its height in the early 2000s, Compuware achieved annual revenues of greater than $2 billion with a market cap exceeding $15 billion. In 2003, Karmanos moved Compuware’s headquarters from Farmington Hills, Michigan to downtown Detroit on the long-vacant site of the former Kern Department store at One Campus Martius. Construction of the 1,088,000 square foot, $350 million high rise began in 2000 and concluded in 2003, with approximately 4,000 Compuware employees moving into the tech company’s new headquarters building the same year. A long-time supporter of Detroit, Karmanos was the first major business leader in the 2000s to move his company to the distressed city, proving a catalyst in enticing more businesses to move to Detroit and the revitalization that has followed in the downtown area as a result. Karmanos served as Compuware's CEO until June 20, 2011, when he became executive chairman. Karmanos retired from Compuware on March 31, 2013, but maintained a consultant role within the company. Compuware terminated his post-retirement consulting agreement, effective October 1, 2013. Karmanos subsequently sued Compuware for wrongful termination, and for improperly stripping him of vested stock options. In 2015, an arbitrator ruled that Compuware must pay $16.5 million to Karmanos, which represented the largest arbitration award for an employment case in Michigan history. The Michigan Court of Appeals subsequently upheld the arbitration award in 2016. MadDog Technology and MadDog Ventures Following his retirement from Compuware, Karmanos, along with several partners, launched Mad Dog Technology in 2014 and MadDog Ventures in 2017, acting as a venture operator and investor focused on companies that develop and market cloud-based business applications that disrupt existing industry models and help monetize underutilized information. Located in Birmingham, Michigan, MadDog Technology, through its venture arm affiliate, MadDog Ventures, provides both capital and operating expertise to help businesses grow and meet their full potential. The MadDog portfolio companies include Resolute Building Intelligence, a provider of building-performance analytics software, and Lenderful, an online lending platform. The firm also holds investments in other, non-MadDog portfolio technology companies. Karmanos is currently a General Partner and Fund Manager of MadDog Ventures. Hockey ventures Karmanos co-founded the Detroit Compuware Hockey organization in the late 1970s with Thewes. The organization has included all levels of hockey from recreational to youth AAA and junior A. The Ontario Hockey League awarded an expansion franchise on December 11, 1989, to be known as the Detroit Compuware Ambassadors. The team later became the Detroit Junior Red Wings, Detroit Whalers and then Plymouth Whalers following a relocation to nearby Plymouth. In 2015, Karmanos sold the Whalers to the owners of Flint's Perani Arena and Event Center, and the franchise was renamed Flint Firebirds. He also sold the Plymouth arena to USA Hockey. Karmanos, his Compuware partner Thewes, and former player Jim Rutherford purchased the Hartford Whalers in 1994. Following the 1996-97 season, the franchise was moved to Raleigh, North Carolina, and renamed the Carolina Hurricanes. Since their arrival in North Carolina, the Hurricanes have captured three division titles (1999, 2002 and 2006), two Eastern Conference championships (2002 and 2006) and the Stanley Cup in 2006, with Karmanos eagerly donning his skates, hoisting the Cup, and skating around with it briefly after the game seven win. For his day with the Stanley Cup, he brought it to Compuware headquarters in Detroit and allowed employees to get their photo taken individually with the Cup. Karmanos also sponsors youth hockey programs in Michigan. Under his backing, Karmanos' youth hockey teams have accumulated numerous state, national and international tournaments. On January 11, 2018, it was announced that he had sold controlling interest in the Hurricanes to Thomas Dundon, while retaining a minority interest. He sold the Florida Everblades in August 2019. Philanthropy An active philanthropist, Karmanos and his wife, Danialle Karmanos, established the Karmanos Center for Natural Birth at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan in 2015, which offers a supportive, home-like environment for expectant mothers looking for a safe, natural childbirth experience with leading training and research. Karmanos donated money to the Michigan Cancer Foundation, which was renamed the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute in 1995 in memory of his first wife, Barbara Ann Karmanos, who died of breast cancer in 1989. Since then, Karmanos, along with his wife, Danialle, has continued to actively support KCI, both personally and through corporate philanthropy. In addition to the Karmanos Center for Natural Birth and KCI, Karmanos and Danialle Karmanos also dedicate their efforts in philanthropic endeavors such as education and the arts. In 2017, they donated money in support of undergraduate student scholarships at the College for Creative Studies (CCS) in Detroit.. In 2014, Karmanos and his wife, Danialle, endowed, in perpetuity, a scholarship that will be given annually to a student from the Metro Detroit area to study for a semester at the American College of Greece in Athens. They are also founding donors of the Detroit Public Theatre. Other philanthropic endeavors include the Detroit Zoo, the Belle Isle Conservancy, Alzheimer's Association, Michigan Humane Society, Dutch Symphony Orchestra, Grace Centers of Hope, and many other worthy charities. Awards and honors In 2015, Karmanos was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in the Builder Category - defined as an individual who has contributed to the development of the game of hockey, moving the game forward. In addition to his selection to the Hockey Hall of Fame, Karmanos has collected a number of major awards during his career as a hockey builder, including the Lester Patrick Award (outstanding service to hockey in the U.S.) after the 1997-98 season, the Bill Long Award in 2010 for outstanding contributions to the OHL and the USA Hockey Distinguished Achievement Award in 2012. He is also a member of the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame and the United States Hockey Hall of Fame. Karmanos was honored by City Year Detroit with the Idealist in Action Award for 2013. In 2000, Karmanos received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Wayne State University. In recognition of Compuware’s stock-price leadership, Karmanos was awarded Mitchell and Company’s CEO 100 Award for 1998. Karmanos' initiative and business prowess were recognized in 1989 by the Institute of American Entrepreneurs, which named him Entrepreneur of the Year. Personal life Karmanos resides in Metro Detroit with his wife, Danialle, who authored the 2013 book, Pete Karmanos – A Life in Progress. The two were married in July 2005 and have four sons. Karmanos also has three sons with his first wife, Barbara Ann, as well as nine grandchildren.

The Manor of Bridlington had been confiscated by Henry VIII from the monks of Bridlington Priory during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, in 1537. In 1624 James I conferred the Manor on Sir J. Ramsey, recently created Earl of Holderness, \\"as a reward for the great services the earl had performed by delivering his majesty from the conspirators of the Gowries, and also for the better support of the high dignity to which he had been lately raised\\". On inheriting it, his son Sir George Ramsey of Coldstream sold it in 1633 for £3,260 to William Corbett and twelve other inhabitants of Bridlington, to administrate it on behalf of themselves and all the other tenants and freeholders of the Manor. A deed, bearing the date 6 May 1636, was drawn up declaring these citizens as Lords FeoffeesFeoffee is a Medieval word meaning freeholder. of the Manor of Bridlington, and empowering them to enrol twelve more Assistants. Rules to elect new Lords Feoffees and Assistants have been adhered to for over three hundred years, and they continue to fulfill their original charter by donating money (earned from rent from the many properties they continue to own in the old town centre) to worthwhile causes in Bridlington, for example the funding of the offshore D CLass D 557 RNLI lifeboat Lord Feoffees III at lifeboat station, and the awarding of bursaries and scholarships to students from Bridlington. The Feoffees were also directed to elect one of their number annually as chief Lord of the Manor, in whose name the courts should be called and the business of the town transacted. The election is still continued on the second day of February, and a manor court is held in the Town Hall in February and November.

The series ended after 92 episodes; the storyline of Barareh was not complete. It aired in Iran daily at 8:00 p.m. Tehran time on Channel 3. Rebroadcast outside of the country was daily on IRIB 1 and IRIB 2. The last show episode aired Thursday 1 December 2005. It was directed by Mehran Modiri. Description The show is set in the fictional village of Barareh in Iran of the 1930s, during the reign of Reza Shah Pahlavi, whose picture can be seen on the set. The village people have their own Persian dialect which humorously modifies the language. In addition to this, the Barareans also have certain customs and rituals which at times are comical, such as their method of eating chick peas—by slapping individual peas from palm into mouth. The village of Barareh is believed by many be a microcosm of Iran. The town is split along the lines of Upper and Lower Barareh, which allegedly mimics the difference between the classes in modern-day Iran. Events in the village, such as football (\\"darbid\\") matches, village council elections and marriage closely mirror today's Iran. The show stars Mehran Modiri, as Shir Farhad, the son of Lower Barareh's khan, or leader. He lives with his sister, Saharnaz; mother, Shadoneh; and father, Salar Khan. The show begins when a journalist, Kiyanoosh, from Tehran is arrested for writing an article criticizing the government, escapes capture, and then is bitten by a snake. Shir Farhad finds him collapsed and brings him to the village of Barareh, nurtures him to health, and gradually introduces him to the town and the other characters in the show, such as the families of Upper and Lower Barareh's Khans, as well as the flamboyant village poet, Bagoori, and village doctor. Later in the series, new characters such as the village gendarme and Upper Barareh's Khan's son and daughter, Keivoon and Leiloon, join the cast. Davooneh doesn't appear in this.

Early life Born into a large Brethren family in Enfield, England, Tipson began his working life, at the age of 14, as an architect's clerk and typist, but was called to missionary service in the early 1900s. Malaysia and Canton Tipson's first posting was to Penang and he sailed there from the UK in November 1908. In October 1909, he traveled to Canton (now Guangzhou) in China where he spent a year mastering the Cantonese dialect. This was to be a vital tool in his missionary work and he went on to acquire the Hokkien dialect. On his return from Canton (March 1911), Tipson married Agnes Millar in Penang and they settled in Kuala Lumpur. His missionary work involved preaching the Gospel, evangelism, and visiting lepers and prisoners. As with most missionaries, in those times, there was the ever-present danger of ill- health and death due to the heat and humidity of British Malaya. In August 1914, his youngest child, Teddie, then one, fell ill with gastro-enteritis and died. Teddie was namesake of Tipson's 15-year-old brother who had died some 20 years previously. By 1917, Tipson became seriously ill, and suffered a nervous breakdown, leaving immediately for Sydney, Australia, despite his wife being eight months pregnant. He could not return home to England due to the First World War and finally arrived back in England in December 1918. After a few years on furlough, Tipson returned to Kuala Lumpur in 1920 and resumed his missionary work. In 1928 he moved to Singapore to take up the post of Secretary to the British & Foreign Bible Society for Malaya. Nearing retirement, at the age of 58, Tipson was incarcerated in Changi Prison during the occupation of Singapore by the Japanese during much of the Second World War. To begin with, he occupied Cell 24, along with Shenton Thomas, the then Governor of Singapore. His ministry in Changi was remarkable in terms of his strength of character and his support for fellow prisoners. Tipson's obituary in the British Association of Malaysia, 1958, said: \\"There were some gifted preachers in the internment camp (Changi), but no one appealed to the men more than Ernest Tipson.\\" Tipson's survival, said his son, also Ernest, was probably due to his tremendous sense of humour and the good company and support of son-in-law David. Liberated in 1945, Ernest Senior traveled to India to be reunited with his wife and son. \\"He was as thin as a stick!\\" remembered Ernest Junior. \\"We fell into each other's arms.\\" After the war, Tipson resumed his work in Singapore briefly, but soon returned to England. He died in Cornwall during a preaching visit to a local Gospel hall. Publications Tipson's linguistic prowess, and later his acknowledged status as a gifted Chinese scholar, was extraordinary in the light of his humble education at a Board School back in England. His Pocket Dictionary of the Amoy Vernacular is still referenced during the compilation of modern Hokkien/English dictionaries. True to his faith and calling, Tipson is said to have ensured that every word in the Bible found its way into his dictionary. Another of his publications, a Complete Chinese Character Course, was based on lectures he gave in Changi Prison during World War II. *A Cantonese Syllabary- Index to Soothill’s Pocket Dictionary, incorporating all Cantonese colloquial characters and their meanings.

Peyote stitch may be worked with either an even or an odd number of beads per row. Both even and odd count peyote pieces can be woven as flat strips, in a flat round shape, or as a tube. Tubular peyote is used to make pouches or to decorate objects such as bottles or fan handles. Many cultures around the world have used peyote stitch in their beadwork. Examples of peyote stitch have been found in artifacts from Ancient Egypt, and the stitch has also been used in historic and contemporary Native American beadwork. The name \\"peyote stitch\\" derives from the use of this stitch to decorate objects used in peyote ceremonies by members of the Native American Church. The name \\"gourd stitch\\" similarly derives from the use of the stitch in decorating gourd containers. Variations on Peyote stitch A variation of the peyote stitch is often referred to as the fast peyote stitch as its use resembles peyote, but it can be done in less time. Much like the first two rows of a peyote stitch project, the speed stitch requires two rows be strung then worked in. It can only be done with an even number of beads but is easily done in either flat or tubular peyote. Peyote Stitch can be done in the round, on the diagonal, flat or tubular. A versatile stitch which is a favourite of many beaders. A new form of peyote stitch has been created by Gerlinde Linz. This is called Peyote with a twist, not bead crochet. Often abbreviated to PWAT, although Linz prefers Peytwist. This form of diagonal peyote, when worked up into a chain can form the look of a crochet rope. The Cellini spiral was originated by seed bead masters Virginia Blakelock and Carol Perenoud who developed the tubular variation and named it after Benvenuto Cellini, a 16th-century Italian sculptor known for his Rococo architectural columns. Eventually, the flat version emerged, and both techniques are equally beautiful.

The is situated northwest of the Brown County Reforestation Camp, , which together cover and have over a half million visitors each year. The NEW Zoo does not receive local or regional tax support for its annual operating budget.  History  The area where the zoo is located was covered with pine and oak forests when European settlers began arriving in the 1800s. Intensive lumbering soon cleared most of the land and residents began planting crops. Once the forests were gone, there were no leaves or logs left to decompose and replenish the sandy soil and the soil was no longer able to produce crops. In the late 1800s, Brown County acquired the area that makes up the Reforestation Camp. In 1948, sparks from a passing train set fire to of county land and destroyed what was left of the forest. This prompted the County Board to build an open prison camp and plant trees, hence the name Brown County Reforestation Camp. Beginning in 1950, Harry Barth, the first camp superintendent, and his wife directed inmates in planting 250,000 white pine, Norway pine, Jack pine, cedar, and spruce seedlings. This continued for several years until the sandy wasteland was once again green forest. During the 1950s, the reforestation camp became part of the county park system. Ponds were dug for fire protection and recreation and fish were stocked. Hiking and ski trails were established. By 1952, bear, deer, and timber-wolves were exhibited at the park and the zoo was established. In 1985, the county board decided to cease providing funds for capital improvements at the zoo. Since then, all new animal exhibits and major improvements have been financed by the NEW Zoological Society, a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization, and by private donations. The most recent addition to the zoo, the Adventure Park, includes dual \\"racing\\" zip lines, an aerial adventure course, and a climbing tower. The park was built to appear minimally invasive and naturally appealing. For example, the historic fire tower, built in 1955, is now the starting point for the dual \\"racing\\" zip lines.  Exhibits  Many types of native plants and animals can be found at the zoo, which features more than 92 exhibits with more than 215 animals from around the world. = Penguin exhibit = Located near the main entrance of the zoo, the penguin exhibit is home to both the African penguin and the South African shelduck. In the spring of 2013, the Species Survival Plan allowed two of the zoo's penguins to breed and visitors could view the baby penguin later that fall. The exhibit has two observing areas, one of which is a bridge overlooking the entire enclosure, and the other allows visitors to watch the penguins swim underwater. = Japanese macaque exhibit = This exhibit is home to a troop of Japanese macaques. Since these animals are a part of the Species Survival Plan, infant macaques can be seen almost every year. = Education and Conservation Center = The education building houses reptiles, arachnids, amphibians, and one emperor scorpion. Species of reptiles include bearded dragon, red-tailed boa, ball python, blue-tongued skink, and European glass lizard. Two amphibian species are on display, the Amazon milky tree frog and the African bullfrog. There are two species of arachnids, the Chilean rose hair tarantula and the orange baboon tarantula. = Tortoise den = The tortoise den is home to a male and a female Aldabra tortoise, which are native exclusively to the Aldabra Atoll. The den has an outdoor enclosure and a tortoise shell-shaped den. = Wisconsin Trail = The Wisconsin Trail is home to many native species and a few from surrounding areas of the country, including the North American otter, the wild turkey, the American black bear, the red fox, the red wolf, the cougar, the helmeted guineafowl, the ruffed grouse, the chukar partridge, the ring-necked pheasant, the bobcat, the Canada lynx, the white-tailed deer, the American badger, the raccoon, and the porcupine. Although not native to the Western Hemisphere, the red panda is also found on the Wisconsin Trail. = Northern Trail = Located in the northeastern corner of the zoo, visitors can travel up to the Riley Building to view animals on the Northern Trail, including mammals such as the black- footed ferret, the cotton-top tamarin, and the moose, as well as birds such as the burrowing owl and the black-necked stilt. Two large tanks on the Northern trail contain northern pike, largemouth bass, and yellow perch. The Riley Building also houses two species of frogs, the green frog and the American bullfrog. = North American aviary = The North American Aviary houses birds that are found locally or in other areas of the United States. Three of the largest birds in the aviary are the American white pelican, bald eagle, and the turkey vulture. Ten species of duck live in the aviary, including the pintail, the common shoveler, the green-winged teal, the English call duck, the ring-necked duck, the canvasback, the redhead, Barrow's goldeneye, the hooded merganser, and the wood duck. = North American plains = On the eastern side of the zoo animals typically found in the Great Plains of the United States are contained in two enclosures. One enclosure contains the American bison, the pronghorn antelope, and the elk; the other contains black- tailed prairie dogs. The plains exhibit's pond has trumpeter swans. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources and the Trumpeter Swan Restoration Committee have collaborated with NEW Zoo since 1994 to take in the young trumpeter swans that are born at the zoo and release them into the wild after two years. = Australia = The Australia exhibit contains animals native to Australia, as well as a few from other parts of the world. Australian species include the kookaburra, cockatoo, emu, dusky lorikeet, and rainbow lorikeet. Other species include the blue duiker and snow leopard. = Africa = In this section of the zoo are the African lions, the wattled crane, the African pied crow, and the reticulated giraffe. The albino alligator, most commonly found in the Southern United States, is also housed in the Africa section. = Children's petting zoo = The children's petting zoo, located on the south side of the zoo, has domestic goats, sheep, red corn snakes, African leopard tortoises, llamas, alpacas, domestic chickens, koi fish, and fallow deer.  Adventure Park  In 2014, the NEW Zoo opened the Adventure Park to the public. Located adjacent to the zoo, the park consists of a zip line, rock climbing wall, and ropes course. Each course give participants to choose their own challenge based on their physical strength. The park was built with the surroundings in mind causing minimal changes to the landscape. = Dual Racing Zipline = Attached to the Reforestation Camp's historic fire tower, participants will travel down 1,000 feet of cable to a platform near the entrance of the zoo. Two cables are present to allow participants to race at speeds reaching up to 40 miles per hour. = Aerial Adventure Course = The ropes course consists of sixty different challenges that are distributed on three levels of increasing difficulty. Participants can choose how far they would like to progress through the course based on their experience. = Climbing Tower = The 40-foot rock wall consists of three different sides. Two of the sides are rock walls with different structures to challenge the participants and a cargo net can be found on the third side. Sustainable practices The NEW Zoo employs green practices to help reduce its environmental footprint. The goals of using sustainable practices are to significantly reduce the zoo's negative environmental impact, improve its ecological footprint, and become an environmentally sustainable zoo and green leader.

The line was built by the Società Anonima della Ferrovia Elettrica Bellinzona-Mesocco and later became part of the Rhaetian Railway. At last the section of the line between Castione-Arbedo, and Cama was operated by the Società Esercizio Ferroviario Turistico (SEFT) as a tourist railway known as the Ferrovia Mesolcinese. The Gotthard railway opened in 1882, providing a transport link to the communities of the valley of the Ticino River. In order to provide a link to the communities of the Val Mesolcina, the Bellinzona–Mesocco railway was opened in 1907. Although intended as a feeder line to the Gotthard railway, the Bellinzona terminus of the BM was located some from the main line station, and the main transfer point was Castione- Arbedo station further north. From the beginning, an extension over the San Bernardino Pass to Thusis was planned, in order to provide a rail connection to the Rhaetian Railway (RhB), but this was not constructed. In 1942 the line was merged into the RhB, but it was never connected to that railway's main network. In 1972, all passenger traffic ceased and the line between Bellinzona and Castione-Arbedo was closed, whilst freight traffic continued on the rest of the line. In 1978 the upper section of the line was damaged by a bad storm, and was never repaired. The remnant of the line between Castione-Arbedo and Cama continued carrying freight traffic until the closure of the factories on the line removed that traffic. In 2003, freight traffic ceased and the line was transferred to SEFT. The original line was long, and was electrified at 1500 V DC using overhead lines. It had 17 stops, a maximum gradient of 6% and a minimum radius of . The surviving tourist line was at last long. It was closed at end of 2013.

It is laid down in a unanimously adopted Council Regulation with the consent of the European Parliament. The financial framework sets the maximum amount of spendings in the EU budget each year for broad policy areas (\\"headings\\") and fixes an overall annual ceiling on payment and commitment appropriations.Financial Framework 2014 - 2020 Financial perspective for the 2007–2013 period On 15 December 2005, EU members agreed to fix the common budget to 1.045% of the European GDP. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair accepted to review the British rebate, negotiated by Margaret Thatcher in 1984. French President Jacques Chirac declared that this increase in budget will permit Europe to \\"finance common policies\\" such as the Common Agricultural Policy – which represents about 44% of the EU's spending – or the Research and Technological Development Policy. However, France's demand to lower the VAT in catering was refused. 2014-2020 Financial Framework The Multiannual Financial Framework for 2014 to 2020 set a ceiling for expenditure at 1% of European Gross National Income, a reduction from the prior framework.Technical adjustment of the financial framework for 2018 in line with movements in GNI (ESA 2010), COM(2017)0473, 15.9.2017. Per the European Council, €959.51 billion in commitments and €908.40 billion in payments for the given timeframe were allotted for expenditure.https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/eu- budgetary-system/multiannual-financial-framework/mff-2014-2020/ The EU's expenditure in this period was in six categories or \\"headings\\" with respective ceilings for spending. 1\\\\. Smart and inclusive growth a. Competitiveness for growth and jobs: the ceiling for this program, supporting research and innovation, investment in trans-European networks and development of small and medium-sized enterprises, was €125.61 billion, which exceeded the previous ceiling for 37%. b. Economic, social and territorial cohesion: with ceiling in amount of €324.94 billion for this subheading. The main goal was reduction of asymmetric levels of development of the EU's regions and expansion of the support of the Union's cohesion policy. 2\\\\. Sustainable growth, natural resources: the ceiling equals to €372.93 billion. Aimed covering environmental action, the common fisheries policy and the common agricultural policy (CAP). 3\\\\. Security and citizenship: the set limit in amount of €15.67 billion. Asylum and migration related actions were financed, as well as initiatives connected with internal security and external borders. 4\\\\. Global Europe: the spending limit of €58.70 billion. Mainly covered Union's activities on international level (humanitarian aid, development assistance). 5\\\\. Administration: with €61.63 billion limit on expenditure, which was decreased in amount of €2.5 billion in comparison with the previous MFF in order to consolidate public finances. 6\\\\. Compensations: ceiling in sum of €27 million was set to support Croatia in contributing less than gained benefits during the first year after its accession to the European Union. Below are the ‘special instruments’ used for the MFF of this period: Emergency aid reserve, with annual amount of €280 million, was used to deal with unpredictable events such as financing humanitarian aid, managing civilian crisis and conducting protection operations in non-EU countries. EU solidarity fund, with annual budgeted amount of not more than €500 million, was designed for the cases of major disasters in any of the member states or in countries negotiating with EU regarding accession. Flexibility instrument, with fixed annual amount of €471 million, was dedicated to clearly identified needs out of the scope of the MFF ceilings. European globalization adjustment fund, with mobilization up to €150 million annually, aiming to support workers, who became unemployed because of globalization, economic crisis, etc., in finding new opportunities of employment. Contingency margin equals to 0.03% of the EU's gross national income (approximately €4 billion) was intended to be used as last-resort instrument in reacting to unforeseen circumstances. Specific flexibility to tackle youth unemployment and strengthen research was giving an opportunity to spend an additional €2.543 billion on youth unemployment and research. In order to maintain the total annual ceilings and headings' allocation the same, the amount was fully balanced out within and/or between headings. The framework did receive a number of amendments and changes during its effective period following a midterm review.ibid Particularly, the budget was shifted towards cushioning labor impacts resulting from the migration crisis straining the budget at the time,ibid 2021 and Onwards Negotiations for the new financial framework for the years 2021 through 2027 remain underway following stalled talks in late February 2020,https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/eu-budgetary- system/multiannual-financial-framework/mff-negotiations/ prolonged further by shutdowns across EU nations provoked by the coronavirus pandemic.https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/articles/news/european- parliament-lockdown-over-coronavirus Negotiations currently center on modern and evolving issues and threats to European safety and stability, namely cyber-attacks, terrorism, disinformation, natural disasters, climate change, human rights violations, and gender inequality.https://eur- lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52018IP0075&from;=GA Debates related to the European Green Deal have also taken center stage, with considerable attention paid to the budget allocated for the project and the Just Transition Fund aimed at providing a speedy transition for more fossil fuel reliant regions.https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy- jobs/news/commission-warns-of-green-deal-failure-if-transition-fund-not-well- financed/ Belgium-based think tank Bruegel has noted that the hulking financial contributions necessary to finance the climate initiatives have remained a sticking point in debates,https://www.bruegel.org/2020/01/a-trillion-reasons-to-scrutinise-the- green-deal-investment-plan/ particularly for the German delegation.https://www.bruegel.org/2020/02/berlin-will-make-or-break-the- european-green-deal/ On 21 July 2020, the European Council agreed to the multiannual financial framework for 2021-2027.https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/meetings/european- council/2020/07/17-21/ References See also *Spending Review External links *Financial Framework 2014 - 2020 *Financial Framework 2007 - 2013 *The budget explained by the European Commission *Glossary provided by the European Commission *BBC News: how the money is spent Category:Politics of the European Union de:Haushalt der Europäischen Union#Mehrjähriger Finanzrahmen ","title":"Multiannual Financial Framework"},{"id":"3418798","title":"PC²"},{"id":"3418807","text":"The Brown County Reforestation Camp is an area of almost located in Brown County, Wisconsin.

The fraternity is focused on the ideals of democracy, service, and brotherhood. History Phi Mu Delta was originally derived from the National Federation of Commons Clubs (NFCC), which was formed at Wesleyan University in 1899. Clarence Dexter Pierce, one of the fraternity's founders, petitioned the NFCC to form a Greek letter fraternity at the 1918 NFCC meeting. Four colleges initially agreed to join the organization, the University of Vermont, the University of New Hampshire, the University of Connecticut and Union College. Union College's Commons Club members later decided against joining, so there were only three founding chapters. The fraternity expanded slowly during the 1920s, merging or expanding to seven additional chapters by 1930. Expansion of the Fraternity was slowed during the great depression. Phi Mu Delta merged with another fraternity, Delta Alpha Pi in 1934-1935, gaining three chapters, all of which closed shortly afterward. In 1936 one of the founding chapters, the University of Vermont, also closed. By the end of World War II, the Connecticut chapter had also closed. After the war, the fraternity expanded more rapidly, coinciding with a general increase in fraternity enrollment. This trend petered out by the late 1960s, and by the late 1970s the organization was making plans to shut down. A reorganization effort centered on the State College, Pennsylvania chapter, stabilized the fraternity, and prompted a resurgence in growth. It was at this time that the University of Vermont was recolonized. In the early 1980s, the organization rewrote its constitution. During the 1980s, the fraternity only gained one chapter (California University of Pennsylvania). Since then the fraternity has expanded steadily. In 2006, the fraternity established an Executive Director position. In 2015, the National Office was moved to Westmont, New Jersey.

While studying in England, he assassinated William Hutt Curzon Wyllie, a British official. Early life Madan Lal Dhingra was born on 18 September 1883 in Amritsar, India, in an educated and affluent Hindu Arora family. His father, Dr. Geeta Mal Dhingra, was a civil surgeon, and Madan Lal was one of seven children (six sons and one daughter). All six sons, including Dhingra, studied abroad. Dhingra studied at Amritsar in MB Intermediate College until 1900. He then went to Lahore to study at the Government College University. Here, he was influenced by the incipient nationalist movement, which at that time was about seeking Home Rule rather than independence. Dhingra was especially troubled by the poverty of India. He studied the literature concerning the causes of Indian poverty and famines extensively, and felt that the key issues in seeking solutions to these problems lay in Swaraj (self-government) and Swadeshi. He found that the industrial and finance policies of the colonial government was designed to suppress local industry and favour the purchase of British imports, of which he felt was a major reason for the lack of economic development in India. Dhingra embraced with particular fervour the Swadeshi movement, which was about encouraging Indian industry and entrepreneurship while boycotting British (and other foreign) goods. In 1904, as a student in the Master of Arts program, Dhingra led a student protest against the principal's order to have the college blazer made of cloth imported from Britain. He was expelled from the college for this. His father, who held a high, well-paying position in government service and had a poor opinion of agitationists, told him to apologise to the college management, not to participate in such activities again, and prevent (or revoke) the expulsion. Dhingra refused, and chose not even to go home to discuss matters with his father, but to take a job and live as per his own wishes. Thus, following his expulsion, Dhingra took a job as a clerk at Kalka at the foot of the Shimla hills, in a firm that ran a Tanga carriage service to transport British families to Shimla for the summer months. After being dismissed for insubordination, he worked as a factory laborer. Here, he attempted to organise a union, but was sacked for making the effort. He moved to Bombay and worked there for some time, again at low-level jobs. By now, his family was seriously worried about him, and his elder brother, Dr. Bihari Lal, compelled him to go to Britain to continue his higher education. Dhingra finally agreed, and in 1906, he departed for Britain to enroll at University College, London, to study mechanical engineering. His elder brother paid for his expenses. With Savarkar Dhingra arrived in London a year after the foundation of Shyamaji Krishnavarma's India House in 1905. This organization was a meeting place for Indian revolutionaries located in Highgate. Dhingra came into contact with noted Indian independence and political activists Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and Shyamji Krishna Varma, who were impressed by his perseverance and intense patriotism which turned his focus to the independence movement. Savarkar believed in revolution by any means and inspired Dhingra's admiration in the cult of assassination. Later, Dhingra became distant from India House and was known to frequent a shooting range on Tottenham Court Road. He joined, and had a membership in, a secretive society, the Abhinav Bharat Mandal founded by Savarkar and his brother Ganesh. During this period, Savarkar, Dhingra, and other student activists were outraged by the 1905 Partition of Bengal. Dhingra was disowned for his political activities by his father Gitta Mall, who was the Chief Medical Officer in Amritsar, who went so far as to publish his decision in newspaper advertisements. Curzon Wyllie's assassination Several weeks before assassinating Curzon Wyllie, Dhingra had tried to kill George Curzon, Viceroy of India. He had also planned to assassinate the ex-Governor of Bengal, Bampfylde Fuller, but was late for a meeting the two were to attend could not carry out his plan. Dhingra then decided to kill Curzon Wyllie. Curzon Wylie had joined the British Army in 1866 and the Indian Political Department in 1879. He had earned distinction in a number of locations including Central India and above all in Rajputana where he rose to the highest rank in the Service. In 1901 he was selected to be Political Aide-de-Camp to the Secretary of State for India. He was also the head of the Secret Police and had been trying to obtain information about Savarkar and his fellow revolutionaries. Curzon Wyllie was said to have been a close friend of Dhingra's father. On the evening of 1 July 1909, Dhingra, along with a large number of Indians and Englishmen had gathered to attend the annual 'At Home' function hosted by the Indian National Association at the Imperial Institute.EJ Beck, Open University, Retrieved 27 July 2015 When Sir Curzon Wyllie, political aide-de- camp to the Secretary of State for India, was leaving the hall with his wife, Dhingra fired five shots right at his face, four of which hit their target. Cawas Lalcaca (or Lalkaka), a Parsee doctor who tried to save Sir Curzon, died of Dhingra's sixth and seventh bullets, which he fired because Lalcaca had come between them. Dhingra's suicide attempt failed and he was overpowered. He was arrested immediately by the police. =Trial= Dhingra was tried in the Old Bailey on 23 July. He represented himself during his trial but did not recognize the legitimacy of the court. He stated that his assassination was done in the name of Indian independence and that his actions were motivated by patriotism. He also stated that he had not intended to kill Cawas Lalcaca. He was sentenced to death. After the judge announced his verdict, Dhingra is said to have stated: \\"I am proud to have the honour of laying down my life for my country. But remember, we shall have our time in the days to come\\". Madan Lal Dhingra was hanged on 17 August 1909 at Pentonville Prison. He also made a further statement, which is rarely mentioned. =Statement of Dhingra before Pronouncement of Verdict= > \\"I do not want to say anything in defence of myself, but simply to prove the > justice of my deed.

I don't care. I am proud to have the honour of laying down my life for the cause of my motherland.\\" =Reactions= Guy Aldred, the printer of The Indian Sociologist, was sentenced to twelve months hard labor. The August issue of The Indian Sociologist had carried a story sympathetic to Dhingra. Dhingra's actions also inspired some of the Irish, who were fighting to establish an independent Ireland. Political activist Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi condemned Dhingra's actions. Speaking on the matter, he said: After Dhingra went to the gallows, The Times of London wrote an editorial (24 July 1909) titled \\"Conviction of Dhingra\\". The editorial said, \\"The nonchalance displayed by the assassin was of a character which is happily unusual in such trials in this country. He asked no questions. He maintained a defiance of studied indifference. He walked smiling from the Dock.\\" Although the response to the assassination in Britain was one of outrage, admiration for Dhingra's act was privately expressed by David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill, who is reported to have called Dhingra's statement \\"[t]he Finest ever made in the name of Patriotism\\". Last words from gallows The following are said to be Madan Lal Dhingra's last words, just before he died at the gallows: > I believe that a nation held down by foreign bayonets is in a perpetual > state of war. Since open battle is rendered impossible to a disarmed race, I > attacked by surprise. Since guns were denied to me I drew forth my pistol > and fired. Poor in wealth and intellect, a son like myself has nothing else > to offer to the mother but his own blood. And so I have sacrificed the same > on her altar. The only lesson required in India at present is to learn how > to die, and the only way to teach it is by dying ourselves. My only prayer > to God is that I may be re-born of the same mother and I may re-die in the > same sacred cause till the cause is successful. Vande Mataram! (\\"I praise > thee mother!\\") Remembrance Madan Lal Dhingra on a 1992 stamp of India. After his execution, Dhingra's body was denied Hindu rites and buried by the British authorities. His family having disowned him, the authorities refused to turn over the body to Savarkar. Dhingra's coffin was accidentally found while authorities searched for the remains of Shaheed Udham Singh, and repatriated to India on 12 December 1976. His remains are kept in one of the main squares, which has been named after him, in the city of Akola in Maharashtra. Dhingra is widely remembered in India today, and was an inspiration at the time for revolutionaries such as Bhagat Singh and Chandrasekhar Azad. There was a demand from some groups that his ancestral home be converted into a museum. However, his descendants refuse to acknowledge his legacy and refused to participate in events organised to honour his death in August 2015. The family sold his ancestral house and refused an offer to purchase it made by BJP leader Laxmi Kanta Chawla who intended to turn it into a museum.

In inner sphere electron transfer, a ligand bridges the two metal redox centers during the electron transfer event. Inner sphere reactions are inhibited by large ligands, which prevent the formation of the crucial bridged intermediate. Thus, IS ET is rare in biological systems, where redox sites are often shielded by bulky proteins. Inner sphere ET is usually used to describe reactions involving transition metal complexes and most of this article is written from this perspective. However, redox centers can consist of organic groups rather than metal centers. The bridging ligand could be virtually any entity that can convey electrons. Typically, such a ligand has more than one lone electron pair, such that it can serve as an electron donor to both the reductant and the oxidant. Common bridging ligands include the halides and the pseudohalides such as hydroxide and thiocyanate. More complex bridging ligands are also well known including oxalate, malonate, and pyrazine. Prior to ET, the bridged complex must form, and such processes are often highly reversible. Electron transfer occurs through the bridge once it is established. In some cases, the stable bridged structure may exist in the ground state; in other cases, the bridged structure may be a transiently-formed intermediate, or else as a transition state during the reaction. The alternative to inner sphere electron transfer is outer sphere electron transfer. In any transition metal redox process, the mechanism can be assumed to be outer sphere unless the conditions of the inner sphere are met. Inner sphere electron transfer is generally enthalpically more favorable than outer sphere electron transfer due to a larger degree of interaction between the metal centers involved, however, inner sphere electron transfer is usually entropically less favorable since the two sites involved must become more ordered (come together via a bridge) than in outer sphere electron transfer. Taube's experiment The discoverer of the inner sphere mechanism was Henry Taube, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1983 for his pioneering studies. A particularly historic finding is summarized in the abstract of the seminal publication. > \\"When Co(NH3)5Cl++ is reduced by Cr++ in M [meaning 1 M] HClO4, 1 Cl− > appears attached to Cr for each Cr(III) which is formed or Co(III) reduced. > When the reaction is carried on in a medium containing radioactive Cl, the > mixing of the Cl− attached to Cr(III) with that in solution is less than > 0.5%. This experiment shows that transfer of Cl to the reducing agent from > the oxidizing agent is direct…\\" The paper and the excerpt above can be described with the following equation: :[CoCl(NH3)5]2+ \\\\+ [Cr(H2O)6]2+ → [Co(NH3)5(H2O)]2+ \\\\+ [CrCl(H2O)5]2+ The point of interest is that the chloride that was originally bonded to the cobalt, the oxidant, becomes bonded to chromium, which in its +3 oxidation state, forms kinetically inert bonds to its ligands. This observation implies the intermediacy of the bimetallic complex [Co(NH3)5(μ-Cl)Cr(H2O)5]4+, wherein \\"μ-Cl\\" indicates that the chloride bridges between the Cr and Co atoms, serving as a ligand for both. This chloride serves as a conduit for electron flow from Cr(II) to Co(III), forming Cr(III) and Co(II). The Creutz–Taube ion right In the preceding example, the occurrence of the chloride bridge is inferred from the product analysis, but it was not observed. One complex that serves as a model for the bridged intermediate is the Creutz–Taube complex, [(NH3)5RuNC4H4NRu(NH3)5]5+. This species is named after Carol Creutz, who prepared the ion during her PhD studies with Henry Taube. The bridging ligand is the heterocycle pyrazine, 1,4-C4H4N2. In the Creutz–Taube ion, the average oxidation state of ruthenium is +2.5. Spectroscopic studies, however, show that the two ruthenium centers are equivalent, which indicates the ease with which the electron hole communicates between the two metals. The significance of the Creutz–Taube ion is its simplicity, which facilitates theoretical analysis, and its high symmetry, which ensures a high degree of delocalization. Many more complex mixed valence species are known both as molecules and polymeric materials. Mixed valence compounds Mixed valence compounds contain an element which is present in more than one oxidation state. Well-known mixed valence compounds include the Creutz–Taube complex, Prussian blue and molybdenum blue. Many solids are mixed-valency including indium chalcogenides. Mixed valency is required for organic metals to exhibit electrical conductivity. As the extinction coefficient decreases, the coupling constant decreases, influencing the angle to increase. Mixed-valence compounds are subdivided into three groups, according to the Robin–Day classification: *Class I, where the valences are trapped—localized on a single site—such as Pb3O4 and antimony tetroxide. There are distinct sites with different specific valences in the complex that cannot easily interconvert. *Class II, which are intermediate in character. There is some localization of distinct valences, but there is a low activation energy for their interconversion. Some thermal activation is required to induce electron transfer from one site to another via the bridge. These species exhibit an intense Intervalence charge transfer (IT or IVCT) band, a broad intense absorption in the infrared or visible part of the spectrum, and also exhibit magnetic exchange coupling at low temperatures. The degree of interaction between the metal sites can be estimated from the absorption profile of the IVCT band and the spacing between the sites. This type of complex is common when metals are in different ligand fields. For example, Prussian blue is an iron(II,III)–cyanide complex in which there is an iron(II) atom surrounded by six carbon atoms of six cyanide ligands bridged to an iron(III) atom by their nitrogen ends. In the Turnbull's blue preparation, an iron(II) solution is mixed with an iron(III) cyanide (c-linked) complex. An electron-transfer reaction occurs via the cyanide ligands to give iron(III) associated with an iron(II)-cyanide complex. biferrocenium cation is classified as type II mixed valence complex. *Class III, wherein mixed valence is not distinguishable by spectroscopic methods as the valence is completely delocalized. The Creutz–Taube complex is an example of this class of complexes. These species also exhibit an IT band. Each site exhibits an intermediate oxidation state, which can be half-integer in value. This class is possible when the ligand environment is similar or identical for each of the two metal sites in the complex. The bridging ligand needs to be very good at electron transfer, be highly conjugated, and be easily reduced. Organic mixed valence compounds are also known.

Robert Seymour The Yule goat is a Scandinavian and Northern European Yule and Christmas symbol and tradition. Its origin may be Germanic pagan and has existed in many variants during Scandinavian history. Modern representations of the Yule goat are typically made of straw.Cf. Rossel & Elbrönd-Bek (1996:xiv). History The Yule goat's origins go back to ancient Pagan festivals. While a popular theory is that the celebration of the goat is connected to worship of the Norse god Thor, who rode the sky in a chariot drawn by two goats, Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr, it goes back to common Indo-European beliefs. The last sheaf of grain bundled in the harvest was credited with magical properties as the spirit of the harvest and saved for the Yule celebrations, called among other things Yule goat (Julbocken).Schager, Karin. Julbocken i folktro och jultradition (Yule goat in Folklore and Christmas tradition), Rabén & Sjögren, 1989. This connects to ancient proto-Slavic beliefs where the Koliada (Yule) festival honors the god of the fertile sun and the harvest. This god, Devac (also known as Dazbog or Dažbog), was represented by a white goat, Kropej, Monika. Supernatural Beings From Slovenian Myth and Folktales, Scientific Research Centre of the Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts, 2012. consequently the Koliada festivals always had a person dressed as a goat, often demanding offerings in the form of presents. Zguta, Russell. \\"Russian Minstrels\\", University of Pennsylvania Press, 1978. A man-sized goat figure is known from 11th-century remembrances of Childermas, where it was led by a man dressed as Saint Nicholas, symbolizing his control over the Devil. Other traditions are possibly related to the sheaf of corn called the Yule goat. In Sweden, people regarded the Yule goat as an invisible spirit that would appear some time before Christmas to make sure that the Yule preparations were done right. Objects made out of straw or roughly-hewn wood could also be called the Yule goat, and in older Scandinavian society a popular Christmas prank was to place this Yule goat in a neighbour's house without them noticing; the family successfully pranked had to get rid of it in the same way. The function of the Yule goat has differed throughout the ages. In a Scandinavian custom similar to the English tradition of wassailing, held at either Christmas or Epiphany, young men in costumes would walk between houses singing songs, enacting plays and performing pranks. This tradition is known from the 17th century and still continue in certain areas. The group of Christmas characters would often include the Yule goat, a rowdy and sometimes scary creature demanding gifts.The Museum of Nordic History - Julbocksmask (Yule goat Mask) Att gå med stjärnan (To Walk with the Star) (The Museum of Nordic History) A 19th century Christmas card God Jul by Jenny Nyström. During the 19th century the Yule goat's role all over Scandinavia shifted towards becoming the giver of Christmas gifts, with one of the men in the family dressing up as the Yule goat.Cf. Reade (1914:71). In this, there might be a relation to Santa Claus and the Yule goat's origin in the medieval celebrations of Saint Nicholas. The goat was then replaced by the jultomte (Father Christmas/Santa Claus) or julenisse during the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, although he is still called the Joulupukki (Yule goat) in Finland, and the tradition of the man-sized goat disappeared. The modern Yule goat A Swedish Gävle goat (Gävlebocken). The Yule goat in Nordic countries today is best known as a Christmas ornament. This modern version of the Yule goat figure is a decorative goat made out of straw and bound with red ribbons, a popular Christmas ornament often found under or on the Christmas tree. Large versions of this ornament are frequently erected in towns and cities around Christmas time - a tradition started with the Gävle goat in the 1960s.  Julebukking  Julebukking is a Scandinavian Christmas tradition. Julebukk (Dictionary of American Regional English) Retrieved 14 November 2012 Between Christmas and New Year's Day, people wearing masks and costumes (Julebukkers) go door to door, where neighbors receiving them attempt to identify who is under the disguise. In one version of Julebukking, people go from door to door singing Christmas songs. After they have sung, they are usually awarded with candy. Another tradition requires that at least one person from the visited household join the band of Julebukkers and continue to the next household.Jul (Store norske leksikon) Retrieved 14 November 2012 In certain aspects, the custom resembled the modern-day tradition of Halloween trick-or-treating.
