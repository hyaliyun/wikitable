The barricade fences constructed from bamboo prevent excessive drifting of the sand and thus preserve the dune area. A local landmark in Dunedin, New Zealand ‚Äî the St. Clair Beach posts are the remains of a series of sandbreaks, originally linked by boards to catch the blown sand. A sand fence or sandbreak, is a barrier used to force windblown, drifting sand to accumulate in a desired place, much like a snow fence. Sand fences are employed to control erosion, help sand dune stabilization, keep sand off roadways, and to recruit new material in desert areas. Sand fences are also commonly employed following storm events in order to aid in the dune recovery process, particularly in developed areas where dunes are critical for protection of property. A typical construction is to attach a perforated plastic sheet to stakes at regular intervals, similar to construction site fencing or temporary sports field fencing. Another is a cedar or other lightweight wood strip and wire fence, also attached to metal stakes. A permanent sand fence is generally of larger wooden poles set deeply into the ground with large wooden planks running horizontally across them. The drifting and settling of sand behind and in front of such a fence occurs because the wind speed on both the downwind and windward sides is less than that on the far windward side, allowing light materials such as sand to settle. Campbell, E. (March 1975). Snowdrift Structures. Avalanche Protection in Switzerland (pp. 103-116). Fort Collins CO: General Technical Report RM-9, USDA-Forest Service.

Today, the larger part of this population is concentrated in Northern Thrace, but much is spread across the whole of Bulgaria and the diaspora. Until the beginning of the twentieth century the Thracian Bulgarians lived also in the whole of Thrace, then part of the Ottoman Empire. After the persecutions during the Preobrazhenie Uprising and the ethnic cleansing, caused to the Bulgarian population in Eastern Thrace after the Second Balkan War, these people were expelled from the area. After World War I, Bulgaria was required to cede Western Thrace to Greece. A whole population of Bulgarians in Western Thrace was expelled into Bulgaria-controlled Northern Thrace. This was followed by a further population exchange between Bulgaria and Greece (under the Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine), which radically changed the demographics of the region toward increased ethnic homogenization within the territories each respective country ultimately was awarded. At this period the Bulgarian Communist Party was compelled by Comintern to accept the formation of a new Thracian nation on the base of this people in order to include them in a new separate Thracian state, as a part of a future Balkan Communist Federation.V, Joseph. The Communist Party of Bulgaria; Origins and Development, 1883-1936. Columbia University Press. p. 126.

He played as a central defender. Playing careerEarly career= Bodley was born in Hayes, in the London Borough of Hillingdon. He began his football career as an apprentice with Chelsea, and turned professional in 1985. He played eight times for the first team in all competitions before leaving for Northampton Town for a fee of ¬£50,000 in January 1989. He played 20 league games for the club before moving into non- league football with Barnet, who paid ¬£15,000 for his services in October 1989. =Barnet, Southend United and loans= Bodley contributed to Barnet's Conference title in 1991, and to their run to the third round proper of that year's FA Cup, scoring twice in their 3‚Äì1 defeat of Heybridge Swifts in the fourth qualifying round. In the 1992‚Äì93 season, Bodley was one of 11 Barnet players awarded free transfers by the Football League because the club had not paid their wages. He joined Southend United in July 1993, linking up with former Barnet manager Barry Fry who had joined the club not long before. In three seasons with Southend he played 79 games in all competitions, and spent two months on loan at Gillingham, whose supporters made a ¬£2,500 donation to the club in an attempt to fund the player's stay for a third month: a fruitless gesture, as the player joined Birmingham City five days later, also on loan, as cover for injuries and suspensions among the defence. =Peterborough United, St Albans City and Dagenham & Redbridge= In July 1996, Peterborough United manager Barry Fry, who had worked with Bodley at Barnet, Southend and Birmingham, paid his former club ¬£75,000 for his services. Bodley took part in the club's record league win, against his former club Barnet in Division Three in September 1998: Peterborough won 9‚Äì1, and Bodley's own goal meant they actually scored all ten. Bodley played more than 100 games in all competitions, and was appointed club captain, before he and teammate Derek Payne were allowed to leave Peterborough on a free transfer for Isthmian League Premier Division club St Albans City, strengthening their squad prior to the FA Trophy semi-final. Bodley played six league games for the club and took part in both legs of the Trophy semi-final, which St Albans lost 4‚Äì3 on aggregate. In the 1999 close season he became manager Garry Hill's first signing for Dagenham & Redbridge, soon to be followed by Payne. Awarded the captaincy, Bodley led his players to the Isthmian League title, and with it promotion to the Conference National; they lost only five games all season, and finished the campaign with ten successive victories. =Canvey Island= At the end of the season he signed for Canvey Island, and contributed to their reaching the second round of the FA Cup in his first season. Doubtful for the first-round match at home to Port Vale because of a groin injury, Bodley declared himself fit, played 90 minutes in the tie which ended 4‚Äì4 draw, and played 120 minutes in the replay as Canvey won 2‚Äì1 after extra time to set themselves up a local derby with Southend United. Bodley, one of eight former Southend players on Canvey's books, would miss it through suspension, though the club enquired whether the game might be moved to the Friday to allow him to take part; as the venue was already booked that night for a carol concert, the match was played as scheduled, and Canvey lost 2‚Äì1. That same season, Bodley played as Canvey won the FA Trophy, defeating Forest Green Rovers 1‚Äì0 at Villa Park to become the first side from below the Conference to win the Trophy for 20 years. Postponements because of cup success and bad weather caused fixture congestion at the end of the 2001‚Äì02 season, leaving Bodley facing a schedule of seven games in nine days combined with having to get up at 4:30am for work as a postman. Bodley underwent a knee operation in November 2001 which kept him out for several weeks, then in March 2002 he damaged a tendon which put an end to his season and effectively meant his retirement. Personal life When Bodley left professional football he worked as a postman. He is married with daughters.

In 1653 he was a soldier in Oliver Cromwell's life- guards, and a \\"great preacher\\" of the anabaptists, but his views were republican, and he took part in the plots of 1655‚Äì6. Committed to the Fleet Prison in 1657, he successfully petitioned Richard Cromwell for release in 1658. In 1660 Sir Edward Hyde found him anxious to serve the king, likely to be useful among the sectaries, and surprisingly well acquainted with recent royalist negotiations. He was elected Member of Parliament for Winchelsea in the Convention Parliament.History of Parliament Online- Howard, WIlliam In 1674 he was discovered in secret correspondence with Holland, spent several months in the Tower of London and was set free only upon making a full confession. Succeeding his brother Thomas Howard, 2nd Baron Howard of Escrick as Lord Howard in 1678, he sat on the lords' committees which credited Titus Oates's information, and furthered the trial of his kinsman, William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford. In 1681 he was again sent to the Tower on the false charge made by Edward Fitzharris, of writing the True Englishman. Algernon Sidney's influence procured his release (February 1682). From then he was part of the \\"country party\\" (early Whig) opposition. He was arrested on the first rumours of the Rye House plot, and turned informer at the trial of William Russell, Lord Russell (July 1683). He gave accounts of meetings at John Hampden's and Russell's houses, which mainly led to Russell's conviction. His evidence similarly ruined Sidney, although Henry Booth, 1st Earl of Warrington, was fortunate in being tried by his fellow peers, who did not believe Howard's charges against him. He himself was pardoned, and died in obscurity at York in April 1694. By his wife Frances, daughter of Sir James Bridgman, and niece of Sir Orlando Bridgman, he had six children, including Charles, fourth baron, on whose death in 1715 the title became extinct. He was one of the most detested and despised men of his age: John Evelyn called him \\"that monster of a man\\".

Originally conceived and constructed under the auspices of Robert Moses, the twin tunnels have been superseded by the Trans-Manhattan Expressway in Washington Heights, which itself runs through a cut with high-rise apartments built over it in places. In the 1950s, the Trans-Manhattan Expressway (I-95) was constructed as a high-speed interstate bypass of the tunnels, and by 1962, the two tunnels were out of commission. Both Tunnels are now are being used by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey as storage space.  History  The tunnels were built to carry traffic between the east side of Upper Manhattan and the George Washington Bridge (which opened in 1931) on the west side. Originally, only the 178th Street Tunnel existed, being constructed in 1940 and serving both directions. Construction began on the 179th Street Tunnel in March 1949 and was completed over two years later. At that time, the 178th Street Tunnel was reconfigured to serve eastbound traffic only, while the 179th served the westbound. The two tunnels had a similar display, with a stone arch for portals and \\"Whitestone\\" light posts. After the end of World War II, New York public works baron Robert Moses started work on a bypass in Manhattan of the Washington Heights area to serve the George Washington Bridge. The traffic for the George Washington Bridge began to overwhelm the twin two-lane tunnels. In addition, the ventilation system was inadequate, and needed replacing. The plans for the Trans-Manhattan Expressway were conceived in 1955 and seven years later, the new expressway opened to traffic. Following the closures, the entranceway of the 178th Street tunnel was used as a secondary emergency equipment garage for the George Washington Bridge but later removed. The two tunnels are currently being used as storage space. Although the two tunnels were closed, there were proposals to use them again for vehicular traffic. A study was completed, in which the tunnels would be rehabilitated and reused temporarily for traffic diverted from a reconstruction of the Trans-Manhattan Expressway and the Alexander Hamilton Bridge. The rehabilitation never happened and the tunnels continue to be used as storage.

For a short period in 1659, he was Speaker of the House of Commons. He served in the 1660 Convention Parliament that agreed the Restoration settlement, but other than a brief period in 1688, retired from active politics in 1661. A devout Presbyterian, and supporter of Sabbatarianism, like his older brother Francis Bampfield, he published a number of religious works. He died in October 1693. Biography Thomas Bampfield was the eighth son of John Bampfield of Poltimore and his wife Elizabeth, members of the Devon gentry. Like most of their contemporaries, he and his brothers supported Parliament during the 1638 to 1651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms, although there is no record of his military service. His elder brother Sir John Bampfylde, MP for Penryn until his death in 1650, was one of those excluded by Pride's Purge in December 1648. Another, Francis Bampfield (1615-1683), was a Seventh Day Baptist, who spent nine years in prison for his religious convictions. Career Bampfield attended Exeter College, Oxford, followed by legal training at Middle Temple in 1642; the First English Civil War meant he did not qualify as a lawyer until 1649. In 1654, he was appointed Recorder of Exeter; an important legal position, it led to his election as Member of Parliament for Exeter in the First Protectorate Parliament. It is not clear whether he attended; like many others, he refused to accept Oliver Cromwell's insistence all MPs 'recognise' constitutional limits set out in the Instrument of Government. In 1656, he was re-elected to the Second Protectorate Parliament, and was an active participant; in the Third, he acted as Speaker from 14 April 1659 until it was dissolved on 22 April. He backed the restoration of MPs excluded in 1648, and sat in the Convention Parliament that invited Charles II to resume the throne. St Stephen's, Exeter However, his opposition to the restoration of Episcopacy in the Church of England, and support for regulations prohibiting drunkenness and profanity were out of step with the public mood. He lost his position as Recorder in October 1660, and did not stand again for election as an MP. His brother Francis, a former Royalist and Prebendary of Exeter Cathedral, rejected his conservative religious beliefs, and became an advocate of Saturday Sabbatarianism. Evicted from his living after the 1662 Act of Uniformity, he spent the next nine years in Dorchester gaol. By 1667 Thomas was converted to Sabbatarianism by Francis, who set up a Seventh Day Baptist community in prison. Removed as a JP in 1665, Thomas regained some of his former positions in 1688, as the Catholic James II tried to build support among Nonconformists. However, he relinquished them after the 1688 Glorious Revolution. In his last years, he published several works on Sabbatarianism, which elicited responses from mathematician and theologian John Wallis, as well as Baptist minister Isaac Marlow. He died on 8 October 1693, and was buried at St Stephen's, Exeter. Published works * \\"An Enquiry Whether the Lord Jesus Christ made the World, and be Jehovah, and gave the Moral Law?

Although great tits achieve a change in song frequency by switching song types, in other urban birds the change in frequency might be related to the Lombard effect. For instance, in humans, the Lombard effect results in speakers adjusting frequency The Lombard effect or Lombard reflex is the involuntary tendency of speakers to increase their vocal effort when speaking in loud noise to enhance the audibility of their voice. This change includes not only loudness but also other acoustic features such as pitch, rate, and duration of syllables. This compensation effect maintains the auditory signal-to-noise ratio of the speaker's spoken words. The effect links to the needs of effective communication, as there is a reduced effect when words are repeated or lists are read where communication intelligibility is not important. Since the effect is involuntary it is used as a means to detect malingering in those simulating hearing loss. Research on birds and monkeys find that the effect also occurs in the vocalizations of animals. The effect was discovered in 1909 by √âtienne Lombard, a French otolaryngologist. Lombard speech Listeners hear a speech recorded with background noise better than they hear a speech which has been recorded in quiet with masking noise applied afterwards. This is because changes between normal and Lombard speech include: * increase in phonetic fundamental frequencies * shift in energy from low frequency bands to middle or high bands * increase in sound intensity * increase in vowel duration * spectral tilting * shift in formant center frequencies for F1 (mainly) and F2 * the duration of content words are prolonged to a greater degree in noise than function words * great lung volumes are used, * it is accompanied by larger facial movements, though these do not aid as much as sound changes These changes cannot be controlled by instructing a person to speak as they would in silence, though people can learn control with feedback. The Lombard effect also occurs following laryngectomy when people following speech therapy talk with esophageal speech. Mechanisms The intelligibility of an individual's own vocalization can be adjusted with audio-vocal reflexes using their own hearing (private loop), or it can be adjusted indirectly in terms of how well listeners can hear the vocalization (public loop). Both processes are involved in the Lombard effect. =Private loop= A speaker can regulate their vocalizations, particularly their amplitude relative to background noise, with reflexive auditory feedback. Such auditory feedback is known to maintain the production of vocalization since deafness affects the vocal acoustics of both humans and songbirds Changing the auditory feedback also changes vocalization in human speech or bird song. Neural circuits have been found in the brainstem that enable such reflex adjustment. =Public loop= A speaker can regulate their vocalizations at higher cognitive level in terms of observing its consequences on their audience's ability to hear it. In this auditory self-monitoring adjusts vocalizations in terms of learnt associations of what features of their vocalization, when made in noise, create effective and efficient communication. The Lombard effect has been found to be greatest upon those words that are important to the listener to understand a speaker suggesting such cognitive effects are important. =Development= Both private and public loop processes exist in children. There is a development shift however from the Lombard effect being linked to acoustic self-monitoring in young children to the adjustment of vocalizations to aid its intelligibility for others in adults. =Neurology= The Lombard effect depends upon audio-vocal neurons in the periolivary region of the superior olivary complex and the adjacent pontine reticular formation. It has been suggested that the Lombard effect might also involve the higher cortical areas that control these lower brainstem areas. Choral singing Choral singers experience reduced feedback due to the sound of other singers upon their own voice. This results in a tendency for people in choruses to sing at a louder level if it is not controlled by a conductor. Trained soloists can control this effect but it has been suggested that after a concert they might speak more loudly in noisy surroundings, such as after-concert parties. The Lombard effect also occurs to those playing instruments such as the guitar. Animal vocalization Noise has been found to affect the vocalizations of animals that vocalize against a background of human noise pollution. Experimentally, the Lombard effect has also been found in the vocalization of: * Budgerigars * Canaries * Cats * Chickens * Common marmosets * Cottontop tamarins * Japanese quail * Nightingales * Rhesus macaques * Squirrel monkey. * Zebra finches * Beluga whales * Pale spear-nosed bats * T√∫ngara frogs See also * Acoustic ecology * Bird vocalization * Human voice * Intelligibility (communication) * Noise health effects * Noise pollution * Occlusion effect * Whale song References Category:Phonetics Category:Human voice Category:Animal communication Category:Human communication Category:Noise pollution ","title":"Lombard effect"},{"id":"22872789","text":"Hinckley Airport is a privately owned, public-use airport located three nautical miles (6 km) west of the central business district of Hinckley, a village in DeKalb County, Illinois, United States.

The mill was dismantled c1860, and the body was moved to the grounds of the medieval hall known as Houghton Park Farm, now The Old Hall. The Mill was part of the complex of outbuildings, which later became Alder Carr Farm. The mill had Patent sails, which were transferred to a tower mill at Kersey when the mill was dismantled.

Reactionary modernism is a term first coined by Jeffrey Herf in his 1984 book, Reactionary Modernism: Technology, Culture and Politics in Weimar and the Third Reich, to describe the mixture of \\"great enthusiasm for modern technology with a rejection of the Enlightenment and the values and institutions of liberal democracy\\" which was characteristic of the German Conservative Revolutionary movement and Nazism.The Totalitarian Present: Why the West Consistently Underplays the Power of Bad Ideas, Jeffrey Herf, The American Interest In turn, this ideology of reactionary modernism was closely linked to the original, positive view of the Sonderweg, which saw Germany as the great Central European power neither of the West nor of the East. Herf's application of the term to describe fascism has been widely echoed by other scholars.Mark Neocleous, Fascism, University of Minnesota Press, 1997, p. 60. Herf had used the term to denote a trend in intellectual thought during the era, what German novelist Thomas Mann had described as \\"a highly technological romanticism\\" during the interwar years. Herf used the term in reference to a wide range of German cultural figures, including Ernst J√ºnger, Oswald Spengler, Carl Schmitt, and Hans Freyer. Reception of the concept Historian Nicolas Guilhot has broadened the scope of reactionary modernism, applying the term to trends in Weimar Republic industry, medicine (eugenics), mass politics, and social engineering. Reactionary modernism can be seen in the fascist concept of the New Man, as well as in art movements of Weimar culture that emphasized rationalism and embraced Futurism and the New Objectivity. Many Weimar period artists rejected the Futurists' fetishization of machinery and violence, for example the proponents of German Expressionism. Despite this, the return to order became a dominant theme in German culture and in that of other European countries. Reactionary modernism in interwar Europe Since Herf created the neologism, it has gained mainstream currency with historians in discussing the paradoxical European enthusiasm for paternalistic authoritarianism and volkish nationalism on the one hand, and new technological and political concepts on the other hand, all under totalitarian regimes. Reactionary modernism has been explored as a theme in the interwar literature and broader political culture of Great Britain. It has been examined in the context of other European countries during the interwar period, including Romania, Greece,Antoniou, Yiannis, Michalis Assimakopoulos, and Konstantinos Chatzis. \\"The National Identity of Inter‚Äêwar Greek Engineers: Elitism, Rationalization, Technocracy, and Reactionary Modernism.\\" History and Technology 23.3 (2007): 241-261. Sweden, and Spain.Geoffrey Jensen, Irrational Triumph: Cultural Despair, Military Nationalism, and the Ideological Origins of Franco's Spain (Reno: University of Nevada Press, 2001), 4. It has even been examined in the context of fascism in Japan. Other historians acknowledge the term's recognition of an influential trend in European philosophical, cultural and political thought during the period when fascism was on the rise. Reactionary modernism in the present day Herf now applies the term to claim similarity to the governments of Iran under the Ayatollahs, the government of Iraq under Saddam Hussein, and extremist Islamist groups such as Al Qaeda. Other scholars, including Paul Berman, have also applied Herf's term to radical Islamism.Power and the idealists, or, The passion of Joschka Fischer and its aftermath, Paul Berman, Soft Skull Press, 2005, p. 168.Fascism, Mark Neocleous, University of Minnesota Press, 1997, p. 2.New World Empire: Civil Islam, Terrorism, and the Making of Neoglobalism, William H. Thornton, Rowman & Littlefield, 2005, p. 74.Radical Islam: Medieval Theology and Modern Politics, Emmanuel Sivan, Yale University Press, 1990, p. 81. Cultural critic Richard Barbrook argues that members of the digerati, who adhere to the Californian Ideology, embrace a form of reactionary modernism which combines economic growth with social stratification. Critiques of reactionary modernism Thomas Rohkr√§mer criticized the concept of reactionary modernism, arguing \\"It is simply not strange or 'paradoxical to reject the Enlightenment and embrace technology at the same time', but a common practice in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Germany as well as in many other countries. Instrumental reason and technology are available for an endless number of different purposes, many of which are not humane or enlightened\\".Rohk√§mer, Thomas, \\"Antimodernism, Reactionary Modernism and National Socialism. Technocratic Tendencies in Germany, 1890-1945\\", accessed 28/12/2016, p. 49 Support for this view also came from Roger Griffin, who argued \\"[F]ascism as an ideology and movement can be seen as proposing a radical alternative to liberal and socialist visions of what form modernity ideally should take. It represents an uncompromising rejection both of thorough-going liberalism and extreme 'modernism', whose logical culmination it sees as relativism, anomie, subjectivism, and the loss of definitive meaning and 'eternal' values. It is an attempt to re-anchor modern human beings within that highly modern phenomenon, the totalitarian state (a term used positively by Fascism) through consciously manipulated historical, national and racist myth (all deeply modern ideological constructs)\\".Griffin, Roger, \\"Modernity under the New Order: The Fascist Project for Managing the Future\\", published by Thamesman Publications, Oxford Brookes School of Business imprint, 1994, accessed 28/12/2016, p. 10-11 Raphel Costra argues that fascism is a modernist movement, as its desire for revolutionary and total projects to remake society could only have emerged in the early 20th century when society and culture were permeated with modernist meta-narratives of cultural renewal. Fascism, in the words of historian Modris Eksteins, \\"was a desire to create mankind anew.\\"Costa, Raphael. From Dictatorship to Democracy in Twentieth-Century Portugal. Palgrave Macmillan, 2016, pp.34-35 David Roberts, in his 2016 book Fascist Interactions, argues that \\"by now it is widely held that fascism was not some revolt against modernity but the quest for an alternative modernity.\\"Roberts, David D.

He was Speaker briefly in 1659. Chute was the son of Chaloner Chute of the Middle Temple. He was admitted to Middle Temple and was called to the bar. He developed a great reputation at the bar and was defence lawyer in several high-profile cases including Sir Edward Herbert (the king's attorney-general), Archbishop Laud, the eleven members of the House of Commons charged by Fairfax and his army as delinquents, and James Duke of Hamilton. In 1653 he bought The Vyne, the Tudor palace which is located near Sherborne St John on the outskirts of Basingstoke in Hampshire. He demolished much of the northern part of the decaying building and employed the architect John Webb, a pupil of Inigo Jones, to add the portico to the north front in the 1650s, the first of its kind on an English country house. The Vyne Memorial to Chaloner Chute in the chapel of The Vyne in Hampshire Chute was elected Member of Parliament for Middlesex in the Second Protectorate Parliament in 1656 (but was prevented from taking his seat). He was elected MP for Middlesex again to the Third Protectorate Parliament in 1659 and became its first Speaker. However he had to stand down because of ill health and died in April. Chute married Anne Place, widow of William Place of Dorking, Surrey and daughter of Sir John Scory of Wormesley, Herefordshire. He was succeeded by his only surviving son Chaloner.

It establishes and monitors the expenses scheme for Members of the House of Commons, and is responsible for paying their salaries and expenses. Following revisions to the Parliamentary Standards Act in April 2010 (via the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010), IPSA was also given responsibility for setting the level of MPs' salaries. Role IPSA is responsible for: setting the level of and paying MPs‚Äô annual salaries; paying the salaries of MPs' staff; drawing up, reviewing, and administering an MPs‚Äô allowances scheme; providing MPs with publicly available information relating to taxation issues; and determining the procedures for investigations and complaints relating to MPs. Upon its formation IPSA took over some of the functions previously undertaken by the House of Commons Fees Office, as well as some of the staff who previously carried out these functions. Consultation IPSA is required by statute to consult with certain bodies when setting the expenses scheme. In addition to consulting with this group, IPSA invited the public to respond to the consultation. The consultation was open from 4 January until 11 February 2010. In June 2010 IPSA launched three further consultations, on amendments to the expenses scheme; proposals on publication; and on the compliance officer's processes. Report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life Sir Christopher Kelly, the Chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, published a report on 4 November 2009 looking at MPs' expenses. His report had no formal powers, but provided recommendations to IPSA, and was used to inform the final allowances scheme prepared by IPSA. Publication of first expenses scheme IPSA published their first expenses scheme on 29 March 2010. It had a largely positive reaction from MPs, the media, and the general public, although there was some criticism of the continued ability of MPs to employ one family member. MPs' salaries Before the formation of IPSA, MPs were able to determine their own salaries and expenses. After the 2009 parliamentary expenses scandal, this role was taken from politicians and given to IPSA. In July 2015, IPSA announced that MPs' salaries would be increased from ¬£67,000 to ¬£74,000. They stated this \\"one-off adjustment\\" was needed to correct disparities between MPs and the rest of the public sector in terms of pay and pensions which they felt was the result of successive governments' reluctance to tackle the contentious issue. IPSA also commented that further pay rises would be linked to the average earnings in the public sector. Then Prime Minister David Cameron publicly criticized the move, saying \\"I don‚Äôt think this was the right decision\\", having previously criticized such a move as \\"simply unacceptable\\", given the rest of public sector pay had been capped for the duration of the parliament. Cameron, however, defended MPs accepting the rise, assuring them \\"the right thing to do is to be paid the rate for the job\\". The 10% pay rise was controversial as the rest of the public sector pay had been capped at 1% per year. Some MPs stated that they would not accept the pay rise but instead transfer it to charities. IPSA announced further pay rises of 1.3% and 1.4% to MPs' salaries in line with average earnings within the public sector as determined by the Office for National Statistics in 2016 and 2017 respectively. In March 2017, IPSA had to apologise to MPs after accidentally publishing information about MPs' staff and their salaries on the internet. Criticism IPSA has been criticised publicly by many MPs, including David Cameron, who, in 2010, told IPSA to \\"...get a grip on what they are doing and do it fast.\\". Criticism has been largely centred on the perceived high running costs of IPSA, inability of MPs to get through on the IPSA helpline, emails and letters going largely unanswered, and the length of time taken to reimburse expenses.

Approximately 4,500 students attend the college. The Seevic campus name was originally an acronym for South East Essex Sixth (VI) Form College. The Thundersley campus opened in September 1972. The Palmer's Campus in Grays can trace its history back to 1706. The Seevic Campus offers adult education courses for learners of any age. Both campuses offer a special needs department for anyone with a learning disability. The Palmer's campus opened its special needs department in September 2018, following the success of the Seevic Campus one which has been running for several years and has over 94 students in the department. In 2018 Seevic merged with Palmer's College as part of a government initiative. From September 2018 the colleges were renamed USP College with a new logo. It was announced in March 2019 that USP had purchased local apprenticeship provider ITEC Learning Technologies which would increase the number of apprenticeship training options USP could offer. Merging In 2017 it was announced that Palmer's College and Seevic College would merge to make one college, over the year running up to September 2018, both colleges underwent extensive changes. In June 2018 the college was officially renamed USP College. The new name included a new logo and a new look to both campuses. The new college would continue to offer a mixture of Further Education, Adult Education and Higher Education courses. Seevic College  Seevic entrance SEEVIC College was a Sixth Form college located in Thundersley, Essex. It offered a variety of GCSE's, A-Levels and Higher Education courses (in association with The University of Hertfordshire, Writtle University College and The Docklands Academy). This is now the SEEVIC campus of USP College. =History= The name was originally an acronym for South East Essex Sixth (VI) Form College. The College in Thundersley opened in September 1972 and was designed to support 12 partner schools across Castle Point and Rochford districts. During the 1990s the college expanded into the former temporary home of Castle Point Borough Council in a building called the White House, the Training for the Millennium Centre on Canvey and a small centre at the former Park School site in Rayleigh. During the noughties they had planned to expand by knocking both the main site and the White House down and rebuilding. In 2017 OFSTED rated SEEVIC as requires improvement however it came third in the national results for GCSE in Maths. The college offers courses such as performing arts, science, health and social care. Approximately 2,500 students attend the college. New Campus Basildon In 2008 SEEVIC opened a new centre at the Icon in Basildon, named New Campus Basildon in partnership with Prospects College and South East Essex College as part of a government initiative to increase FE provision in the town. In 2011 a second campus was opened at Church Walk, but after the merger of Thurrock and Basildon College with South East Essex College in 2010, the ICON building was closed. New Campus Basildon as an FE centre was closed and it became a Studio school in 2013, with SEEVIC as its main sponsor. SEEVIC withdrew from sponsoring the studio school in 2016 and it closed in 2017. =Location= The Seevic Campus is located on Kiln Road (A13) Thundersley, Benfleet, Essex, England. =Notable alumni= * Ashley Banjo * Jordan Banjo * Emma Blackery *Bobby Lockwood *Andrew Zisserman FRS *Joseph Mackenzie.

It offers a wide range of courses including A-levels, BTECs and Secretarial. It is now one of two campuses of USP College. =History= Palmer's was first opened in 1706 when the merchant William Palmer founded a charity school for \\"ten poore children\\" of the parish of Grays Essex, endowing it with valuable property in the town and Lombard Street in the City of London. Initially located in a small building inside the churchyard the school evolved into a boys' school. However, in response to the changing educational landscape initiated by the 1870 Education Act, the trustees of Palmer's charity re- launched the school on a new site on the hill above the town in 1874. To this a girls' school was added in 1876.Herbert Brooks, William Palmer and his School. Being an account of the founder of Palmer's Charity at Grays Thurrock, Essex (Colchester, 1928). The schools were grammar schools for both boys and girls, and William Strang, 1st Baron Strang, perhaps Palmer's most distinguished alumnus, recalled it in 1905 as 'a modest establishment, modest that is in size and in material equipment, but not at all modest in the opinion which it held of itself'.Lord Strang, 'Fifty Years Ago', in J. R. Hayston (ed.), 250 Years on. To commemorate the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the trust deed by which William Palmer endowed in 1706 a school in Grays Thurrock (1956), p. 59. See also Strang's autobiography, Home and abroad (1956) The boys' school which admitted both day pupils and boarders until 1970, achieved the status of a public school in 1931‚Äì46. In 1972, as part of the reorganisation of education in Essex, the boys' and girls' schools amalgamated, together with Aveley Technical High School, to constitute a sixth form college. During the mid-1970s, the boys' and Aveley schools relocated to the College's present site (until then occupied by the Girls' School alone). The College was supported by the William Palmer College Education Trust, the direct successor of the trustees William Palmer appointed to administer his charity. Artifacts from the schools' past can be seen in the College library. A 2007 inspection by Ofsted concluded: \\"Palmer's is an outstanding college.\\" Student achievement and the standard of work were good and success rates overall 'well above national averages for learners from all backgrounds'. The College was also praised for its retention rates and value-added scores. In 2013 a subsequent report rated the college as \\"Requires Improvement\\" because few students studying academic courses were achieving high grades, there were no consistent standards of teaching, learning and assessment, and the college's leadership had failed to maintain the high standards reached in 2007, with many of the implemented measures, particularly regarding the performance management of teachers, being ineffective. 2008 saw a record number of students applying to the College with over 2000 students enrolling. The College was equipped with modern teaching facilities set in landscaped grounds. Both students and the general public had access to a newly refurbished sports and fitness centre (including gym), Palmer's hosts a variety of events for children from local schools on its playing fields. The Student Executive were the \\"voice of the students\\" within the college; they were responsible for organising various college events. The Student Executive of 2007‚Äì2008 raised ¬£4,000 for Little Havens Children's Hospice while the Student Executive of 2008/9 raised ¬£3,000 for Cancer Research UK as well as hosting various social events and fundraising days over the course of the year. The school had a good record of students attaining places on the prestigious Prime Minister's Global Fellowship programme. The school achieved its first two students in the inaugural year of the programme, 2008. In 2009 it had another successful applicant.British Council website \\"Fellows\\" accessed 10 November 2009. In 2006 Palmer's College celebrated its 300th anniversary. =Location= The college is situated on Chadwell Road (B149) next to the A1089 just north of the A126 junction (Marshfoot Interchange).https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/39601 It is close to the boundary between Little Thurrock (to the west) and Chadwell St Mary.

At the 2016 census, the urban area of Mannum had a population of 2,398. Mannum is the seat of the Mid Murray Council, and is situated in the state electoral district of Hammond and the federal Division of Barker. History The Aboriginal inhabitants and traditional owners of the vicinity now called Mannum were the Nganguruku (Nganguruga), part of the larger Ngayawung community.archives.samuseum.sa.gov.au/tindaletribes/nganguruku.html In 1830 the Sturt expedition passed through the area by boat. No Europeans visited again until 25 January 1838 when the expedition of Dr George Imlay and John Hill, on horseback from Adelaide, became the first to reach the Murray overland within South Australia.Register, 23 June 1838, p. 3. They noted that the thriving Indigenous population were very keen fisherfolk. The first European settlement in the area was in 1840. The first ship (a side-wheel paddle steamer) built on the Murray River was launched at Mannum by William Randell in 1852. A shipbuilding industry continued in Mannum until into the 20th century. William Randell is memorialised by the preservation of the rectangular boiler from the paddle wheeler Mary Ann in the town's recreation park. His dry dock held the Marion, an 1897 built paddle wheeler; managed by the National Trust of South Australia as a museum. The Marion left active service in 1950 and spent until 1963 as a boarding house.Larkins & Parish 1982, p.186 The Marion was recommissioned in 1994 and currently operates as a daytrip and overnight cruising vessel along the Murray. A number of other manufacturing industries were established in the town, and some continue; although not as large as they once were. The largest heavy manufacturing company was David Shearer (later Horwood-Bagshaw) who made farm equipment. Mannum apparently has the distinction of having lost more men per head of population in both World Wars than any other town in South Australia. There is a song, called Year of the Drum, written by Wendy Joseph which describes the tragic effects of the World Wars on several generations of the people of Mannum and the use of music to entice young men to war. The song references Mannum, Shearers, Riverboats and the Murray River.http://mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=82992 Heritage listings Mannum has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Anna Street: David Shearer's Dwelling and Observatory * Cliff Street: Bleak House * Noa No Road: Noa No Landing * Randell Street: William Randell's Dry Dock * 51-53 Randell Street: Shearer's Agricultural Implement Factory Site and Stamp Press Relics * off Western Boundary Road: Reedy Creek Railway Bridge Modern Development Mannum's significance as a river port declined with the railways reaching Morgan in 1878 and Murray Bridge in 1886. The largest ship operating on the Murray is the PS Murray Princess, a passenger stern-wheel paddle boat based at Mannum offering weekly cruises. The restored historic paddle steamer PS Marion is also based at Mannum and cruises several times a year. Before restoration, it was a static display in a drydock for many years. Mannum is also a base for houseboats available for hire. Because of its position on the Murray River; in 1954 the Mannum‚ÄìAdelaide pipeline was built to help provide Adelaide with a reliable water supply. Today, Mannum is a busy township and a popular tourist destination, particularly during the summer months. The population of Mannum and the surrounding area grows to about 10,000 when semi-residents (shack owners) and tourists are taken into consideration. The town has three hotels, a Foodland and IGA supermarket and many specialty shops. Media Mannum was home to the regional newspaper, the Mannum and District Recorder (2 June 1955 ‚Äì 16 June 1960), which was then continued as the Murray Plains Recorder (13 January 1961 - 24 September 1964). It was then merged into The Leader which is still published in Angaston. In the years around World War 1, another publication, the Mannum Mercury and Farmer's Journal (30 March 1912 - 2 March 1917), was also printed. It was then absorbed into The Mount Barker Courier and Onkaparinga and Gumeracha Advertiser. Later, the phrase \\"Mannum Mercury\\" was revived as the Mannum news page of the Murray Valley Standard. Sports and Recreation The town has an Australian Football team competing in the River Murray Football League; nicknamed the Roos. The Mannum Rowing Club was founded in 1910.http://www.mannumrowingclub.websyte.com.au/site.cfm?/mannumrowingclub/1/ The club is located on River Lane on the banks of the Murray in Mannum. The club hosts the annual Mannum Regatta and the Arnold Cup.http://www.rowinghistory-aus.info/club-histories/adelaide/10-1.php Mannum hosts a number of other sports during the year, most notably netball in the winter months (the netball club is also nicknamed the Roos), and cricket and tennis in the summer months. The local Community Complex hosts many various indoor sports, including basketball, squash, various martial arts and it contains a gym and other workout rooms. In the summer months, particularly over the January holidays, water sports are extremely popular (mainly water skiing and wakeboarding), where both residents and tourists bring their own water craft to use on the river.

He is the first British ESA astronaut, the second astronaut to bear a flag of the United Kingdom patch (the first was Helen Sharman, who visited Mir as part of Project Juno in 1991), the sixth person born in the United Kingdom to go on board the International Space Station (the first was NASA astronaut Michael Foale in 2003) and the seventh UK-born person in space. He began the ESA's intensive astronaut basic training course in September 2009 and graduated on 22 November 2010. Early life Peake was born in Chichester, West Sussex, on 7 April 1972. He studied at the Chichester High School for Boys, leaving in 1990 to attend the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. CareerMilitary and aeronautical= Upon graduation from Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, Peake received a short-service commission as a second lieutenant in the Army Air Corps on 8 August 1992. He served as a platoon commander with the Royal Green Jackets, and was promoted to lieutenant on 8 August 1994. On 9 July 1997, he transferred to a regular commission, receiving a promotion to captain on 20 August. Peake became a qualified helicopter pilot in 1994 and a qualified helicopter instructor in 1998, graduating from CFS(H) at the Defence Helicopter Flying School at RAF Shawbury in Shropshire. Promoted to major on 31 July 2004, he graduated from the Empire Test Pilots School in Wiltshire the following year, and was awarded the Westland's Trophy for best rotary wing student. He then served on Rotary Wing Test and Evaluation Squadron (RWTES) at MOD Boscombe Down completing trials on Apache helicopters. Peake completed a BSc (Hons) in Flight Dynamics and Evaluation at the University of Portsmouth the following year. Peake left the army in 2009 after 17 years of service and over 3,000 flying hours to his credit, becoming a test pilot with AgustaWestland. In ESA Peake on the NEEMO 16 mission Peake beat over 8,000 other applicants for one of the six places on the ESA's new astronaut training programme. The selection process included taking academic tests, fitness assessments and several interviews. Peake moved to Cologne with his family for the ESA training. Peake was the first British or UK-born person to fly into space without a private contract (as did Helen Sharman, Mark Shuttleworth, and Richard Garriott) and/or foreign citizenship (held by astronauts Michael Foale, Gregory H. Johnson, Piers Sellers, Nicholas Patrick, Shuttleworth, and Garriott). As part of his extensive astronaut training in 2011, Peake and five other astronauts joined an international mission, living in and exploring cave systems in Sardinia. This ESA CAVES mission enabled them to study how humans react to living in extreme conditions with complete isolation from the outside world. This expedition gave the team an idea of what they could expect and how they would cope in the confined space of the ISS. On 16 April 2012, NASA announced that Peake would serve as an aquanaut aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory during the NEEMO 16 undersea exploration mission, scheduled to begin on 11 June 2012 and last twelve days. The NEEMO 16 crew successfully \\"splashed down\\" at 11:05 am on 11 June. On the morning of 12 June, Peake and his crewmates officially became aquanauts, having spent over 24 hours underwater. The crew safely returned to the surface on 22 June. During Expedition 44 Peake served as a backup astronaut for Soyuz TMA-17M spaceflight. =Expedition 46/47= Peake prior to his launch to the ISS Peake was launched to the space station (ISS), on 15 December 2015, for Expeditions 46 and 47. He launched successfully at 11:03 GMT from Baikonur Cosmodrome on board Soyuz TMA-19M. The official website dedicated to his mission is principia.org.uk. During launch, as per tradition, each cosmonaut was allowed three songs to be played to them. Tim chose Queen's \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\", U2's \\"Beautiful Day\\" and Coldplay's \\"A Sky Full of Stars\\". Peake working in the Columbus module During docking, the Kurs docking navigation system failed, and a manual docking was performed by Yuri Malenchenko who was alongside Peake and Tim Kopra. This delayed docking with the ISS by 10 minutes. The Soyuz finally docked with the ISS at 17:33 GMT. Peake received messages of support from the Queen and Elton John, after the successful docking. His first meal at the ISS was a bacon sandwich and a cup of tea. Peake celebrating 100 days in space with Expedition 47 Commander Tim Kopra A new year's message by Peake was broadcast by the BBC to celebrate 2016. Peake supported a spacewalk by two American astronauts on 21 December 2015. He participated in the first spacewalk outside the ISS by a British astronaut on 15 January 2016. The purpose of the spacewalk was to replace a faulty sequential shunt unit on the station's solar arrays. Peake pictured during his first career EVA In February 2016, Peake presented Adele with a Global Success award at the Brit Awards in London. On 24 April 2016, Peake ran the 2016 London Marathon from the ISS treadmill. Peake became the first man to run the marathon from space and the second person to run a marathon from space, after Sunita Williams, who ran the 2007 Boston Marathon from the ISS. Peake was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to space research and scientific education. At a special meeting of the Chichester City Council on 17 February 2016, it was agreed unanimously to confer the Freedom of the City upon Peake with the appropriate ceremony after his return later in 2016. Peake being carried to a medical tent shortly after the landing of Soyuz TMA-19M On 18 June 2016, Peake returned to earth from the ISS aboard the descent module of the Soyuz spacecraft that had taken him to the space station in December 2015. The spacecraft landed on the Kazakh steppe in Kazakhstan almost south west of the major city of Karaganda, landing at 09.15 UTC. Peake had completed approximately 3000 orbits of the Earth and had covered a distance of 125 million kilometres (78 million miles).UK astronaut Tim Peake returns to Earth International Space Station partnership and the Nobel Peace Prize At the UK National Student Space Conference in early 2014, Peake expressed his support for the initiative to award the International Space Station partnership the Nobel Peace Prize. \\"I was delighted to read about the International Space Station and the discussions about it being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize because ‚Ä¶ it has been one of the most incredible international partnerships...[The ISS] really has brought many nations together through difficult times, and continues to do so.\\" Peake noted that with increasing constraints on space programs around the world, collaborative initiatives such as ISS will be necessary for future endeavours. \\"I think [the ISS] really has to be the model for future space exploration because with budgets becoming more and more constrained, then, really one nation is not going to have the capability to expand exploration out into the solar system, to Mars and beyond. We are going to have to work together on projects.\\" Personal life Peake is married to Rebecca, with whom he has two sons, and enjoys climbing, caving, cross-country running and triathlon. When he was younger Peake was a Cub Scout and is now an ambassador for the Scout Association in the UK.

In January 2013, Gon√ßalves was appointed to his first job abroad, at Mozambique's Clube Ferrovi√°rio de Nampula. Two years later, having taken the club to runners-up in the Mo√ßambola, he signed a new contract. He left at the end of his deal in November 2015, rejecting another club in the African country due to his desire to manage back home again. Gon√ßalves headed back to Mozambique in June 2017, taking the helm at reigning champions Clube Ferrovi√°rio da Beira. That year, they became the first club from their nation to reach the quarter-finals of the CAF Champions League, losing on the away goals rule to USM Alger. In December 2018, the board decided to keep him for another season, after losing the cup final to CD Costa do Sol.

The windmill is located at Thelnetham, Suffolk, England. It was built in the early nineteenth century to grind wheat into flour. Thelnetham windmill worked by wind power until 1924, latterly on two sails, after which it became derelict. In 1979, a group of enthusiasts purchased Thelnetham windmill for restoration. Numerous volunteers helped to restore the mill to full working order over an eight-year period. The mill is open to the public, and flour ground at the mill can be bought at the site. The mill is a small four storey tower mill with Patent sails and winded by a fantail. It drives two pairs of millstones, with a third pair driven by an auxiliary engine. History The earliest record of a windmill in Thelnetham was a post mill which was shown of Joseph Hodgkinson's map of Suffolk of 1778. In 1818, the post mill was moved to Sandy Lane, Diss, Norfolk The post mill was replaced by a tower mill, which was built by millwright George Bloomfield for William Button in 1819. The mill was set to work on Christmas Day 1819. In 1832, the mill was modernised by the fitting of a cast-iron windshaft, Patent sails and a fantail. The new windshaft was fitted on 16 July 1832. It was made by J Aickman, the King's Lynn millwright, and weighs 1¬æ tons (1,780 kg). A new stock was fitted in September 1836. William Button died on 11 February 1837. The mill passed jointly to his widow Rebecca and their son Richard. Richard Button worked the mill until 1860, at which date it was conveyed to his sons Richard and William, who sold it to Richard Peverett from Kenninghall, Norfolk in 1862. The mill was worked by Stephen Peverett, Richard's son. He inherited the mill on the death of his father in 1875 and leased it to Henry Bryant in 1879. In 1884, the mill was sold by auction, and Henry Bryant purchased the freehold. Bryant rebuilt the floors of the mill. From 1892, a portable steam engine was used as auxiliary power, driving an extra pair of millstones on the ground floor. This was replaced in 1914 by a Hornsby oil engine. Bryant ran the mill until 1920 when he sold it to Alphonso Vincent, a retired millwright from Garboldisham, Norfolk. The Hornsby engine was sold in the early 1920s. The mill was tailwinded c1920, and as a result one pair of sails was removed. Vincent carried out some repairs to the mill and ran it until he retired in 1924. One of the remaining two sails was wrecked in 1926 when the mill was again tailwinded.If the wind is blowing from the opposite direction to that which the mill it is facing, the mill is tailwinded. In this situation a fantail will not be able to turn the mill into wind. On the death of Alphonso Vincent in 1932, his son George inherited the property. He lived at the site in an old lorry until his death in 1973. The mill passed to his daughter, who sold it in 1974 to Mr and Mrs Humphries, who intended to convert it into a house. They later changed their minds and offered it for sale for restoration. In 1976, the cap of the mill was blown to pieces in a gale. Thelnetham windmill was purchased by five members of the Suffolk Mills Group in November 1979, and plans for restoration were made. The consortium consisted of Mark Barnard, Charles Dolman, Peter Dolman, David Pearce and Chris Seago. The derelict mill and an acre of land cost ¬£6,000. The cake made to celebrate the bicentenary of Thelnetham Windmill.In 2013, the mill was gifted to the Suffolk Building Preservation Trust, which also owns Pakenham Watermill. On 14 July 2019, the bicentenary of the windmill was celebrated. The Locomobile lorry that George Vincent had lived in, now restored to its original army condition, was present. Also in 2019, the mill was used as a polling station during the Eurpoean Parliament election in May, and in the General Election in December. The usual venue, Thelnetham Village Hall being unavailable due to it undergoing a major refurbishment. Restoration The derelict mill before restoration began The mill was restored over a period of six years. Much of the work was carried out by enthusiasts who used working holidays to repair the mill. =1979‚Äì1980= The consortium took possession of the mill in November 1979. The first priority was to make the mill as weathertight as possible. Polythene sheets were spread on the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water penetration of the structure. The mill was surveyed and recorded. In spring 1980, the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure. Scaffolding was erected to allow the fanstage to be dismantled, and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame. A two-week work-in was held at the end of July and beginning of August 1980. Thirty-three volunteers worked on the mill over the work-in. Two new main floor beams for the dust floor were made from baulks of pitch pine which had previously been in a maltings at Bury St Edmunds. On 3 August 1980, the windshaft and remaining sail fragments were removed by a mobile crane, followed by the cap frame and the cast-iron curb sections. New oak joists were laid on the dust floor and temporary boarding laid to provide a working platform for repairs to the top of the mill tower. The bin floor was removed, apart from one oak main beam which was repairable. A replacement main beam was made from pitch pine, and the oak beam was repaired. New oak joists were fitted, along with some salvaged from the original floor which were fit to be reused. One of these had previously been a whip from a Common sail. Some of the joists were made from pitch pine from the Eastbridge Windpump, which, following its collapse on 19 February 1977, had been re-erected at the Museum of East Anglian Life, Stowmarket. The sack hoist was dismantled to enable its repair, brickwork was repaired, and new lintels were made for some of the windows. A tarpaulin was secured over the mill tower to keep the weather out over winter. The floorboards on the bin floor were replaced and one of the two pairs of millstones was removed. The work was financed by grants of ¬£500 from the Council for the Preservation of Rural Essex,In recognition of the work carried out by the Suffolk Mills Group between 1974 and 1978 on Ramsey Windmill, Essex ¬£250 from St Edmundsbury Borough Council, ¬£200 from the Scarfe Trust, and ¬£200 from the Suffolk Mills Group. Other donations and income amounted to ¬£65, with the balance of expenditure being met jointly by the five owners. The \\"work-in\\" was reported in both local and national media, including BBC Look East, Bury Free Press,Bury Free Press, 9 May 1980 Eastern Daily Press, East Anglian Daily Times, Daily Telegraph, and Radio Orwell. =1981= In the 1981 season two separate work-ins were held, the first from 25 July to 2 August and the second from 22 August to 30 August. A total of 37 volunteers participated over the two weeks. The millstones were removed from the stone floor, which was then repaired. One of the main beams was found to have been attacked by Death Watch beetles, and over a third of the elm beam was replaced with oak. The six supports for the hurst frame were repaired one at a time, as they bore the whole of the weight of the machinery above. One post required replacement. It had rotted and the floor had sunk by causing the second main floor beam to fracture. When this work had been completed, the stone floor was removed, including the second main floor beam, which was removed in one piece so that the most suitable route to install its replacement could be assessed. The new main beam for the stone floor was installed and the ground floor was concreted. The stone floor was reconstructed, reusing the old stone bearers and those joists that were fit for reuse. Other joists were made new from oak or pitch pine. New floorboards were laid in the dust floor, the thick elm boards being double-grooved with a metal tongue between them. Those on the bin floor are of a similar configuration. The top four courses of brickwork of the mill tower were removed and work began on rebuilding them, aided by a trammel attached to the upright shaft. During the second work-in, the remainder of the stone floor was boarded, again using double-grooved boards with a metal tongue between them. The window on the dust floor was rebuilt and the reconstruction of the top four courses of brickwork continued. The top two courses were rebuilt with red engineering bricks. The dust floor window had a reinforced concrete lintel cast as the tower was weak at this point and had distorted. The windshaft, the curb segments and fantail gearing were given two coats of red lead paint. A new finial for the cap was made from a piece of oak long by diameter. A start was made on removing the old pointing on the brickwork and repointing with gauged mortar. After the work-in had finished, the boarding of the stone floor was completed and the mill thoroughly cleaned in preparation for an open day which was held in late autumn. The work done in 1981 cost ¬£3,250. Donations received were ¬£2,000 from Rank Xerox, ¬£1,704 from the Historic Buildings Council and ¬£130 from St Edmundsbury Borough Council. Other donations and income received amounted to ¬£70. The project received further coverage in local media, the Eastern Daily Press, and South Norfolk News. =1982= The 1982 work-ins took place from 24 July to 1 August and 21 August to 29 August. The work planned included the completion of the brickwork at the top of the tower, installation of the Elm curb, a start on the construction of the new cap, installing machinery and making and fitting various doors and windows. The cap frame was constructed, incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be reused. The cap frame was completed in autumn 1982. It had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the windshaft into position. =1983= Work in the early part of 1983 was mainly confined to smaller jobs such as casting various brasses and overhaul of the various parts of the fantail drivetrain and mechanism for controlling the Patent sails. The mill was generally made as safe as possible inside in preparation for scheduled visits, including one from the Wind and Watermill Section of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. Other work included the overhaul of the final drive to the stones, including dismantling the stone nut and replacement of three cogs in beech. When the weather improved, work commenced outside. The cap circle was mostly constructed before the first work-in commenced. The work-ins took place over two separate weeks in July and August, with 35 people participating. During the first work-in, the fantail posts and braces were fitted. The oak cap ribs, which had been prefabricated offsite were fitted and the finial was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting. Intermediate noggings of oak were fitted and the finial was pulled into position using a windlass. The cap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate ribs and noggings. The rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time. Between the two work-ins, the rear dormer was completed and the fitting of noggings to the cap frame completed. This enabled a start to be made on boarding the cap on the Monday of the second work-in. The boards for the cap are ¬Ω inch (13 mm) thick and wide at the petticoat, tapering towards the top. A new neck bearing was installed under the windshaft, not without difficulty and much machining before it would fit. When the boarding of the cap was completed, the cover strips were fitted over the joints. The petticoat was drawn into position using a rope and windlass, and the galvanised steel reinforcing band screwed into position, producing a sturdy structure. The striking rod was fitted through the windshaft and the axle for the fantail fitted in position on top of the fantail posts. At the top of the mill tower, the curb was prepared to accept the cap, and the cast iron curb track plates bolted into position. Repointing of the brickwork of the tower continued, with nearly half of it completed at the end of the second work-in. After the work-ins had ended, work continued on finishing the cap which was scheduled for lift-on in October. The weather hampered the work initially, but the application of a modern microporous paint, designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain waterproof, was completed in time for the lift-on. A mini work-in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted, with 17 people participating over the weekend. Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill. The tarpaulin was removed and the trammel dismantled. The 5-ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983, watched by a crowd of some 70 people. The fitting of the cap was toasted with beer from Adnams Brewery, Southwold. Restoration work in 1983 cost ¬£1,408. Grants were received from the Association of Independent Museums, Blo' Norton Women's Institute, Ipswich Historical Transport Society, the National Association for Gifted Children, Mr D. Porter and the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. Further income came from the sale of guide books and a drawing of the mill by Wilf Foreman. =1984= Four work-ins were held during 1984. The first two were by apprentices from Eastern Electricity Board. Thelnetham Windmill was chosen at the project to benefit from the Young Person's Development Project for that year. Pakenham Watermill had previously benefited from the project, and its owners, the Suffolk Preservation Trust, had suggested that Thelnetham Windmill would be a good candidate for the scheme. Two separate parties spent a week each at the mill. A mains electricity supply was provided. An underground cable was laid with assistance from British Telecom who were trialling a thrust borer which had been developed at their research facility at Martlesham Heath. The thrust borer laid of ducting through which the mains cable was pulled into position. The mill was then supplied with lights and sockets on each floor. Other work undertaken by the apprentices involved repairing some frost damage to the foundation brickwork, digging a drainage trench around the mill and moving the auxiliary engine into position. A concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture, leading to rising damp. A French drain was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem. A Ruston & Hornsby 4YHR diesel engine had been purchased in 1981 and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base with the aid of a mobile crane. After fitting it was then painted. Some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary. Off-site, the new brake wheel and fantail were made. The original brake wheel was too rotten to repair, and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in 1819. The original brake wheel was diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their optimum speed. When the mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill, as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails. The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter. The brake wheel was also rebuilt, with a cast iron segment ring fitted in place of the original cogs, resulting in a wheel in diameter. The opinion of professional millwrights was sought, and it was decided that a scaled-up version of the original brake wheel would be made, but retaining the cast iron teeth segments. The remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill. The original iron segments were all broken, so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat-treated malleable cast iron. When the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for reassembly. The fantail was made. Some of the small gears were replaced. The stocks were made from pitch pine and the blades from Douglas fir. Work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows, with only one window still needing attention when the first work-in began. New beech cogs were fitted to the crown wheel, which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft. The stocks and sails were made during the two work-ins held in July and August, a total of 41 people attending over the two weeks. A second-hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill, but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use. Thus two new stocks were required instead of one. Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds, leaving two options. Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber, or laminated stocks. Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required. Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds. A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years. Thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made. The long stocks were made from Douglas fir. All timber had been pressure treated with preservative and well seasoned. It was estimated that a laminated stock would be up to 20% stronger than a similar stock of solid timber. The timber used was thick and nine laminations were required at the centre, where the stock passes through the poll end of the windshaft. Careful attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces of timber. Both stocks were made during the work-in, with one of them being trimmed and finished ready for use. The stocks were the first laminated stocks made by amateurs. The four sails were made. The originals being slightly different pairs. Those on the inner stock having bays of pitch and those on the outer stock having bays of pitch. It was decided that the new sails would be identical, at the larger pitch. Four long whips were cut from a baulk of pitch pine obtained from a demolished maltings at Bury St Edmunds. The whips are square at their inner end. Sail bars and uplongs were made from modern pitch pine, selected for quality. The mortices for the sail bars were cut. That at the heel of the sail being at 27¬∞ and that at the tip being 15¬∞, decreasing by 1¬Ω¬∞ at each sail bar. Three of the four sails had been completed at the end of the work in. The fantail and associated gearing was fitted to the mill. At the end of the second work-in, the cap could be turned by means of the hand crank. The fantail itself, with the blades painted red, white and blue was installed shortly afterwards. The clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft. It was found that the wallower was eccentric on the upright shaft by ¬Ω inch (13 mm). When this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1/16 th of an inch (less than 1 mm) of true. The clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year. Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors, cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork. The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at the end of the second work-in. The stock, with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock. The process was repeated for the second pair of sails. The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work-in. Work later in the year included the finishing of the fourth sail, balancing the fantail and sorting out teething troubles with the fantail gearing. The brake and brake lever were made and installed and shutter cranks for the sails were cast. Restoration work in 1984 cost ¬£2,918. Grants received were ¬£1,209 from English Heritage, ¬£500 from St Edmundsbury Borough Council, Other donations amounted to ¬£52. Income from open days at the mill came to ¬£151. A boost to the funds was ¬£2,000 from Hervey Benham. This money had been allocated to allow the moving of a derelict post mill buck to Thelnetham. In the end, the removal was not proceeded with, and Mr Benham allowed the donation to remain with the Thelnetham Mill Preservation Trust. The project received further support in local media, including the East Anglian Daily Times, one of the work-ins being featured on Anglia Television's About Anglia programme. =1985‚Äì87= Work planned for 1985 included the replacement of the dust floor window and completion of the stocks and sails. The external walls of the mill were tarred and internal walls plastered. Two work-ins were held, from 20 July to 28 July and 17 August to 26 August. Further work over the next two years saw the restoration completed in 1987. =Restoration team= The restoration of Thelnetham Windmill was made possible by the efforts of 135 individuals and 61 organisations. This was achieved by the donation of labour, plant, materials or grants of money, or by giving discounts for materials purchased or providing publicity for the project. Description The restored mill, May 1989 Terms explained in the Mill machinery article are in italics ;As built in 1819 A four-storey tower mill with Common sails carried on a wooden windshaft, driving two pairs of overdrift millstones. Brake wheel diameter. Winding was by hand. ;As restored The four-storey tower is built of brick, and stands from ground level to the curb. The walls are thick at ground level. The mill is described from the top down. The pepperpot cap sits on top of the tower, giving the mill an overall height of to the finial. It houses the cast-iron windshaft and diameter wooden brake wheel internally. Externally the four double Patent sails span . They are wide and can develop . The eight bladed fantail keeps the mill turned into wind. The top floor of the mill is the dust floor. It could be used for storage of grain and gives internal access to the cap. The cast-iron wallower, which is driven by the brake wheel is carried at the top of the upright shaft, in the centre of the mill. The bin floor is where the grain is stored before being ground into flour. The sack hoist mechanism is housed on this floor, driven from the wooden crown wheel on the floor below by belt. The stone floor is where the two pairs of underdrift French Burr millstones are located. The stones are and diameter. The wooden crown wheel is located towards the ceiling. This drives the sack hoist on the bin floor. Other machinery on this floor are an oat crusher and a flour dresser. The ground floor of the mill is the meal floor. It is where the freshly ground flour is delivered for bagging up. The wooden great spur wheel, located at the bottom of the extended upright shaft and stone nuts are located on this floor. The great spur wheel has been converted from compass arm construction to clasp arm construction. A third pair of diameter French Burr millstones is located on a hurst frame, driven by the auxiliary engine via a fast and loose pulley.

These animals are marine gastropod molluscs in the family Flabellinidae. Taxonomic history The genus Flabellina was established by John Edward Gray in 1833 with the type species Flabellina affinis and characterised by the cerata being arranged on peduncles and the rhinophores being annulate. Many species were added by subsequent authors. In 1981 the genus Coryphella was merged under the older name Flabellina as despite a large range of morphological characters in the 64 species of Flabellinidae and Coryphellidae known at that time, no clear distinction could be found to separate the species into the two genera.Gosliner T.M., Griffiths R.J.

In 2017 an integrative study of the 71 species then considered to be included in Flabellina redistributed the species into seven families and 26 genera.Korshunova, T.; Martynov, A.; Bakken, T.; Evertsen, J.; Fletcher, K.; Mudianta, W.; Saito, H.; Lundin, K.; Schr√∂dl, M.; Picton, B.

Formation After Goa's accession into the Indian union in 1961, Goa became a union territory with its own legislature. Elections to the state assembly were scheduled to be held in 1963. There were calls from many sections in Goa and the neighbouring state of Maharashtra to merger the tiny state into Maharashtra. This demand was spearheaded by the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party. Sensing that the merger would mean the gradual disappearing of Goa's distinct identity and culture, four parties merged to form the United Goans Party in September 1963. The four parties were the Partido Indiano, Goan National Union, United Front Goans and Goancho Paksh. Its first president was Dr. Jack de Sequeira. The United Goans Party was formed by merging Goencho Pokx of Jack Sequeira, the Partido Indiano of Alvaro de Loyola Furtado, the Goa National union of J M Desouza and United Fronts of Goans and Democratic Party who shared a common goal, that of separate identity for Goa, and which was against the merger of Goa with Maharashtra.http://www.navhindtimes.in/in-memory-of-jack-de-sequeira-on- his-100th-birth-anniversary/ The think tank for the United Goans Party came from its second in command, Dr. Loyola Furtado, who many consider as the brains behind the United Goans Party. The main support base for the UGP came from the Catholics of Goa and upper-caste Hindus. Although it was predominantly Christian it did not exclude other groups and also put up Hindu and Muslim candidates. Performance in Elections In the first elections held in 1963, the MGP secured 16 from a total of 30. UGP put up candidates in 24 constituencies and secured 12 and formed the opposition. Two seats, one from Daman and Diu each went to independent candidates. De Sequeira became the leader of the Opposition. Its main manifesto item was \\"Separate Statehood in and outside the Assembly of the Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu and in Parliament\\". Among its key promises were the setting up of a University, industrialization, land reforms and the recognition of Konkani as the regional language. The Church supported the Catholic-dominated UGP against the Communist-led Frente Popular. Role in the Goa Opinion Poll Following MGPs victory in the first election, the MGP demanded that Goa be merged into Maharashtra. The MGP wanted that the issue should be voted in the Goa legislature, as was the norm in a representative democracy. The UGP was of the opinion that such an important decision should not be left to them MLAs but should be put before the people of Goa to decide. If the merger was to be voted in the Goa legislature, it was a foregone conclusion that the MGP with its majority would push through the merger. The UGP MLAs visited New Delhi several times to convince them to hold a referendum in Goa. First they met Jawaharlal Nehru; and after his death, met Lal Bahadur Shastri to press for a referendum. However Shastri died in 1966 in Tashkent and this decision was now left to the new Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The UGP delegation met her and submitted a memorandum that such a monumental decision affecting the future of the State could not be left to legislators alone, but should be put before the people to decide. Finally the central government agreed to hold a referendum in Goa. The UGP demanded that all people from Goa, regardless of where they were staying in India, should be allowed to vote. Those staying outside Goa could vote by postal ballot. However this request was denied. They also demanded that all deputationinsts from Maharashtra should not be allowed to vote and that the Bandodkar ministry should resign to conduct a free and fair poll. The centre conceded the demand for Bandodkar's resignation. The opinion poll was held on 16 January 1967. A total of 3,17,633 votes were polled. The merger was defeated by 34,021 votes. First Split A section of UGP MLAs were unhappy with the very idea of an Opinion Poll. A splinter group of four MLAs headed by Dr. Alvaro De Loyala Furtado came to be known as United Goans (Furtado Group). The main body of the party was known as United Goans (Sequeira Group). The U.G.(F) received recognition from the Election Commission and used The Rising Sun as its symbol. The Furtado Group received the support from Goa Organised Alliance and fielded eight candidates in the next election. The Sequeira Group used The Hand as a symbol. The symbol was associated with St. Francis Xavier. It contested all thirty seats this time, claiming primary responsibility for the Opinion Poll and its verdict and promised a separate Konkani State of Goa. Second Split In 1977, Erasmo de Sequeira joined hands with the Bharatiya Lok Dal, headed by Charan Singh. He did this without consulting his party members. The party members were enraged, causing the UGP(Sequeira group) to split into two groups: UGP (Sequeria Group) and UGP (Naik Group). He lost the next parliamentary election to Eduardo Faleiro of UGP-N in March 1977. In the next Assembly elections, UGP-S managed to win just three seats as compared to UGP-N, which won 10 seats. Decline The UGP had never won an election. It split, first in 1967 and the second time in 1977. Its decline (1977‚Äì1989) corresponded with the rise of the Congress, a national party which did not win any seat in the first elections. Finally it merged with the Congress. Revival in 2016 In 2016 December, former Minister Babush Monteserrate revived United Goans Party.

The Opera House is a wood frame building built in 1873, attached roughly to the adjoining brick Gem Theater, a 1937 masonry cinema. The Opera House was used as a community meeting house, dance hall and theater. The theater was built by Aleck Brown in September 1873 and featured a performance of Pygmalion and Galatea for its opening night, with a cast of professional actors from San Francisco. The Opera House was purchased in 1891 by Alexander S. Thompson of Pioche. Thompson renovated the floor and enlarged the stage. After Thompson's death in 1905 his sons Charles and Frank took over, remodeling in 1907. The Opera House screened its first silent movie in 1915. In 1935 the Opera House was renamed the Gem Theater after Frank Thompson took over sole management, but in 1937 he built a new Gem Theater next door expressly for movies. The Opera House declined from that point. The two story rectangular building shows elements of the Greek Revival style with its shallow front gable/pediment. It originally featured a one-story porch across the width of the facade with a balustrade above, removed but now restored. The front is covered with clapboards while the side and rear are sheathed in board and batten siding. The structure is framed with heavy timber in a post-and-beam arrangement. The ground floor housed commercial space and dressing rooms. The main hall is on the second floor, entered by steep stairs from the street. A shed-roofed addition to the rear is built into the hillside and houses the stage at the second floor level. The Opera House was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It is one of three 19th century theaters remaining in Nevada.

The wills of the 4th and 5th Earls of Egmont were not proven until 1857, after the death of the family solicitor Sir Edward Tierney, by Tierney's son-in-law Sir William Darell. The 6th Earl contested the 5th Earl's will in 1863, on the grounds that Tierney had taken advantage of the 5th Earl's drunkenness to provide a misleading valuation of the estates which influenced the drafting of the will. The 6th Earl ultimately settled out of court with Darell, paying ¬£125,000 for the return of the family estates in Churchtown, County Cork; Tierney and his heirs had realized an estimated ¬£300,000 for their stewardship. Family and parting assets Lord Egmont married Jane, daughter of John Hornby, in 1819. They had no children. Lady Egmont died in October 1870.

Hurricane Georges began as a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa during mid-September 1998. Tracking westward, the wave spawned an area of low pressure two days later, which quickly strengthened into a tropical depression. On September 16, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Georges, and to Hurricane Georges the next day. Over the next few days, an eye developed and deep Atmospheric convection persisted around it. Strong outflow and warm sea surface temperatures allowed the storm to intensify as it tracked towards the west- northwest. The storm reached its peak intensity on September 20 with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h), just below Category 5 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and a barometric pressure of 937 mbar (hPa; 27.68 inHg). Over the following five days, the hurricane tracked through the Greater Antilles, making five landfalls, four as a Category 3 hurricane and one as a Category 1. Shortly after entering the Caribbean, the Georges weakened slightly; however, shortly before crossing Puerto Rico, the storm re-attained major hurricane status. After weakening slightly once more, the storm rapidly organized near the Dominican Republic. A well-defined eye formed and outflow re-established, allowing the storm to reach an intensity of 120 mph (195 km/h) just prior to landfall. During its passage of Hispaniola the circulation was severely disrupted, but Georges maintained hurricane-intensity. On September 23, the storm made landfall in southeastern Cuba as a minimal hurricane. By September 25, Georges entered the Gulf of Mexico and intensified into a Category 2 hurricane. The storm re-organized over the gulf, with the eye fully reforming and deep convection persisting around the center of circulation. By September 27, Georges reached an intensity of 110 mph (175 km/h). Several hours prior to landfall the next day, the hurricane weakened slightly and tracked inland near Biloxi, Mississippi with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). Upon landfall, the hurricane's forward motion slowed, executing a brief clockwise loop before maintaining an eastward drift. Gradually weakening, the hurricane was only a tropical depression by the afternoon of September 29\\\\. Two days later, Georges fully dissipated near the Atlantic coast of Florida. Formation and intensification alt=Satellite image of tropical storm. The circulation is disorganized, and a clear center is not present. Late on September 13, 1998, a tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa. The following day the system featured a large area of organized deep convection and the dvorak technique was initiated. By September 15, ships within the vicinity of the wave reported that a surface circulation had developed and by 1200 UTC, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that a tropical depression, the seventh of the season, while situated about 345 miles (555 kilometres) south-southwest of the Cape Verde Islands. The depression tracked roughly due west in response to a mid-level ridge, building westward, to the north of the cyclone. Throughout the day, banding features developed around the system and deep convection consolidated around the center of circulation. Roughly 24 hours after being declared a depression, the NHC upgraded the system to a tropical storm and gave it the name Georges. For the following ten days, Georges maintained a general west-northwest track for ten days due to a persistent mid to upper- level tropospheric ridge. Gradual intensification took place as the system developed strong outflow and warm sea surface temperatures aided in fueling further development. Easterly wind shear caused disruption of the storms' outflow; however, the center, previously surrounded by two deep areas of convection, was situated underneath one area of thunderstorm activity. By the late morning hours of September 17, an eyewall developed within the circulation, indicating that Georges was nearing hurricane-status. Peak intensity and Lesser Antilles Later on September 17, a banding-eye feature appeared on satellite imagery, leading the NHC to upgrade Georges into a hurricane at 1800 UTC that day. The next day, an anticyclone began to develop over the hurricane, enhancing the storms' outflow. Several hours later, Georges attained Category 2 status as sustained winds around the eye increased to 100 mph (155 km/h). Ahead of the storm, the NHC reported that there were no factors inhibiting further intensification and anticipated Georges to strengthen into a Category 4 hurricane before reaching the Lesser Antilles. A concentric eyewall began to develop late on September 18, briefly stalling the strengthening of the storm. This resulted from an eyewall replacement cycle that led to the formation of a larger eye. alt=Multicolored satellite image of hurricane, with a clear eye at its center. On September 19 and 20, Georges underwent a period of rapid intensification, in which winds increased by 45 mph (85 km/h) in a 24-hour span. At the end of this phase, Georges attained its peak intensity with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 937 mbar (hPa; 27.68 inHg), just below Category 5 status. At the time of peak intensity, a Hurricane Hunter mission into the storm recorded flight- level winds up to 168 mph (270 km/h) while dropsondes measured surface winds up to 175 mph (280 km/h). One of the readings from a dropsonde, that was disregarded, recorded winds of 191 mph (307 km/h) in the lower-levels of the eyewall. This reading was disregarded by the hurricane hunters as it seemed too high and not representative of the actual intensity of Georges. The Hurricane Hunters also noted a large increase in the radius of tropical storm- force winds, prompting the issuance of tropical storm warnings in the Lesser Antilles. Around the time of peak intensity, the eye of Georges was roughly 35 mi (55 km) in diameter. Shortly after attaining peak intensity on September 20, Georges began to weaken, as upper-level vertical wind shear caused the eye to become cloud-filled and was no longer visible on satellite imagery. Convection associated with the storm also became less symmetric in nature. In spite of these factors, Georges remained a major hurricane through September 21. Continued weakening took place as the shear restricted a portion of the hurricane's outflow. At 0430 UTC on September 21, Georges made its initial landfall on Antigua with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h). Several hours later, the storm passed directly over St. Kitts. Shortly after passing over the island, the storm weakened to Category 2 status and winds decreased to 110 mph (175 km/h). Caribbean islands alt=Hurricane moving through the Caribbean. Its well-defined center is situated near the coast of the Dominican Republic. As the storm approached Puerto Rico late on September 21, the wind shear began to relent, allowing Georges to re-organize; however, its outflow was unable to fully redevelop due to its proximity to land. Around 2200 UTC, the storm reattained Category 3 intensity and made landfall in Puerto Rico with winds of 115 mph (185 km/h) before weakening again. Hours later, the storm entered the Mona Passage and began to once again reorganize. As Georges approached the Dominican Republic, it unexpectedly developed a well-defined eye and began to intensify, attaining winds of 120 mph (195 km/h); satellite imagery suggested that Georges re-attained Category 4 intensity. It made landfall on the Dominican Republic at 1230 UTC on September 22 as a Category 3 hurricane. Hispaniola's mountainous terrain was a large factor in the expected weakening of the storm; however, by six hours after landfall, the storm's eye maintained its structure, outflow remained strong, and banding features were still organized. By September 23, however, the center became ill-defined and Hurricane Hunters were unable to fly into the storm until it moved back over water. The hurricane's core was severely disrupted by the mountains of Hispaniola. Although Georges was exceptionally disorganized, it retained minimal hurricane intensity throughout its passage of the island. alt=Hurricane over the Florida Keys. The storm contains a prominent eye feature, with well-defined rainbands. Later on September 23, the storm entered the Windward Passage, maintaining a broad circulation with well-defined banding and an eye-like feature. Little change occurred during the day; the storm made its fifth landfall near Guantanamo Bay, Cuba with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). The storm began to take a more northwesterly track in response to a mid- to upper-level high pressure area to the northeast and a mid- to upper- level low over the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Throughout its passage across Cuba, Georges maintained a well-defined outflow pattern despite having an ill- defined center. By September 24, the storm moved over water north of Cuba, and the eyewall quickly began to redevelop. Gulf of Mexico and dissipation As the hurricane neared the Florida Keys on September 25, its eye reformed and became more pronounced on satellite imagery. The reorganization led to an increase in intensity, and at about 1530 UTC, Georges made landfall near Key West with winds of 105 mph (160 km/h). The hurricane's forward motion shifted to west-northwest, and forecast models indicated that Georges would re-attain Category 3 status before making landfall along the northern Gulf Coast. The slow motion of the storm led to an erratic track, mainly caused by westward wobbles of the eye. Vertical wind shear was estimated at up to 35 mph (55 km/h), restricting outflow within the hurricane and confining the most intense convection to the eastern side of the circulation. alt=Hurricane making landfall on the United States. Part of the storm is still over open waters Between September 26 and 27, the storm continued to slow while turning northwestward. Its wind field became asymmetric during the afternoon of September 26, with hurricane-force winds present only in the eastern side. Later in the day, winds around the center increased to 110 mph (175 km/h), just short of major hurricane status. The possibility of rapid intensification at the time was low. The central barometric pressure continued to decrease through September 28, bottoming out at 961 mbar (hPa; 28.39 inHg). By that time, the storm had become visible on New Orleans, Louisiana, radar imagery, which depicted an incomplete eyewall. The storm continued to slow as it neared its final landfall, and winds around the eyewall slightly decreased. Around 1130 UTC, Georges made landfall near Biloxi, Mississippi with winds of 105 mph (160 km/h). Several hours after moving ashore, Georges weakened to Category 1 status and became quasi-stationary. The storm's slow movement led to extreme amounts of rainfall throughout the southeastern United States, peaking at in Munson, Florida. By September 29, Georges had weakened to a tropical storm and completed a small clockwise loop over southern Mississippi. Subsequently, the storm began tracking west-northwestward at a faster pace. Around 1200 UTC, Georges weakened to a tropical depression, and the NHC issued their final advisory on the system. At this time, the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (HPC) initiated public advisories. The depression maintained a well- defined circulation as it tracked close to the Gulf of Mexico; however, the center of circulation remained inland. Large quantities of tropical moisture fed the storm, allowing it to produce torrential rainfall. By September 30, the low-level circulation began to detach from the upper-level circulation. The HPC issued their final advisory on the depression early on October 1 as it neared the Atlantic Ocean, and it fully dissipated several hours later.

The team consisted of Jay Lethal and Consequences Creed. The team name was a portmanteau of the ring names of Lethal and Creed. HistoryTotal Nonstop Action Wrestling (2008-2010)=Formation (2008) Jay Lethal and Consequences Creed were both wrestling in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA)'s X Division in the summer of 2008. They began teaming with each other, during that same time. They first teamed on August 7, 2008 edition of Impact!, defeating the Motor City Machineguns (Chris Sabin and Alex Shelley). TNA Front Line; World Tag Team Champions (2009) Slammiversary. The two did not properly team, until November 2008, when a heroic group called The TNA Front Line was formed to oppose Main Event Mafia, a villainous group. Lethal and Creed joined Front Line and became a permanent tag team. The team was initially known simply by their ring names. At Final Resolution in December 2008, Lethal won one of the Feast or Fired briefcases in the Feast or Fired match. The briefcase contained a TNA World Tag Team Championship shot. On January 8, 2009 episode of Impact!, Lethal cashed in his title shot, by teaming with his tag team partner, Creed. They were booked to defeat the champions Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm) for the TNA Tag Team Titles; this episode however taped on December 16, 2008. At Genesis, they lost the titles back to Beer Money in a 3-Way Dance, also involving Matt Morgan and Abyss. During this time, Motor City Machineguns left Frontline, beginning a feud between with the newly renamed \\"Lethal Consequences\\" and Machineguns. On February 5 episode of Impact!, Lethal Consequences had a match with Machineguns. During Creed's entrance, he was attacked by Beer Money, causing him to be replaced by Eric Young, with whom Lethal won the match. At Against All Odds, Beer Money defeated Lethal Consequences to retain the TNA World Tag Team Championship, due to Creed's shoulder injury. Feud with Suicide and Dissolution (2009-2010) Suicide in an X Division King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary. In March 2009, Lethal Consequences and Machineguns continued their rivalry, as they exchanged victories in tag matches. They would also battle for the latter team's one half, Alex Shelley's TNA X Division Championship, which would be won by Suicide. Suicide successfully retained the X Division Title against both teams in an Ultimate X match at Destination X, an Xscape match at Lockdown and a King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary. For the rest of the year through early 2010, Lethal and Creed became tag team and X-division jobbers, losing to teams like the Motor City Machine Guns and X-division matches involving many competitors.

It runs southeast from near to Parker's Piece, at the junction with Gonville Place, East Road, and Parkside. It crosses the main railway line (on a bridge closed to motor traffic other than buses) and links to the city's ring road (the A1134). It passes through the wards of Petersfield and Romsey, which are divided by the railway line. It is a busy, largely pedestrianised street containing many independent businesses, churches, a Hindu temple and Cambridge Central Mosque. Near the northwestern end to the south in Mortimer Road off Mill Road is Hughes Hall. Behind Hughes Hall is Fenner's, the cricket ground of the University of Cambridge, which has hosted first-class cricket since 1848. To the north is Anglia Ruskin University, formerly Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology (CCAT). History Mill Road was originally a quiet country lane leading to the southeast out of the city of Cambridge, named after the windmill that stood at what is now the corner of Covent Garden. The coming of the railways in the mid-19th century brought about a rapid development of the eastern part of the city after the University of Cambridge repeatedly blocked attempts to build a more central station. The population of the Mill Road area was listed as 252 in 1801, 6,651 in 1831, 11,848 in 1861 and 25,091 in 1891.Ronald D. Gray, Derek Stubbings, Cambridge street-names: their origins and associations. Cambridge University Press, 2000. , . Petersfield and Romsey Town, the areas of Mill Road to either side of the railway bridge, developed in markedly different ways. Petersfield, to the west of the railway, was originally developed by Gonville and Caius and Corpus Christi colleges (a fact reflected in the naming of the area's streets after college fellows). In 1838 the Cambridge Union Workhouse was opened, a building subsequently to become the Mill Road Maternity Hospital and finally a sheltered housing scheme.Mill Road, Maternity Hospital , Cambridge University Hospitals. Romsey Town, east of the railway, started to be developed after the inclosure acts of the middle 19th century. Expansion of the railway network drove the building of housing for railway workers and the majority of the houses were built in the ten years after 1885.Alan Brigham and Colin Wiles, Bringing it all back home . CIH, 2006. Historically Petersfield has always been thought of by local residents as being on the 'Gown' side of the town and gown divide, with many of the residents having been employed by the University. Romsey, on the other hand, remained predominantly working class with a socialist tradition in its local politics, becoming known locally as 'Red Romsey' or 'Little Russia'.

Known for her English/Yoruba lyrics, Weird MC - also known as Shola Idowu and The Rappatainer - is one of Africa's most popular female rappers, and one of the few Nigerian female artists associated with Afrobeat.Weird MC Early life Ogun-native Idowu was born in the United Kingdom to conservative parents who did not encourage her to go into showbusiness. She had her secondary school education in Maryland Comprehensive Secondary School, Lagos Nigeria, where she made friends with four other girls with whom she formed the hip-hop group Weirdos. Despite their popularity on the campus circuit, they failed to land a record deal, and soon disbanded, and Idowu gained admission into Ogun State University to study Law, but left after a year to focus on her music career, soon gaining a qualification in Music Technology; prior to this she had aspired to become a basketball player, but as the Nigerian Sports Commission did not fully support women in this field, Idowu moved back to England with the intention of emigrating to America to pursure her dream. Music career1990-1996: Early career= Influenced by Fela Kuti, Miriam Makeba, Queen Latifah and Jimi Hendrix, Idowu competed in various rap battles including Club 291 contest, similar to America's Apollo, in which she came third. She toured the UK with DJ P Tee Money in the later half of 1990 and throughout 1991. In 1992 after working with music producer Kevin Best for two months, Idowu released the single \\"I Wanna Make You Jack/Let's Get Wet\\", which received positive reviews from music critics and reached number one in the Choice FM charts. By now, Idowu had begun to use the name by which she is now known - Weird MC, which was coined from the name of her former group. =1997: Simply Weird= In 1996, Idowu returned to her homeland where she released the album Simply Weird - a blend of American-style hip hop and Afrobeat - and featured the self-produced video-single \\"Allen Avenue\\", making her the first Nigerian artist to release a song via that medium. Although Simply Weird has been described as the first ever full-length rap album, this milestone had been reached nearly a decade earlier by Nigerian/American band Sound on Sound with the album From Africa From Scratch, and Pidgin rap duo Junior and Pretty were also a household name in the early nineties. Despite the popularity of \\"Allen Avenue\\", Simply Weird failed to sell an impressive number of copies; critics agreed that it was ahead of its time. However, Idowu was honoured with several awards, including the very first AMEN award for Best Hip Hop Album. =2006:After the Storm= In 2006, Idowu released her second album, After Da Storm. Hip hop was now recognised as a major form of music in Nigeria, and the Don Jazzy and JJC-produced single \\"Ijoya\\" was a massive success, earning her an AMEN award for Most Pop Song, and a Channel O Music Video Award for Best Special Effect. Other work Apart from being a solo artiste, Idowu has collaborated with other artistes including Femi Kuti and close friend Kween, and in 2010 she was the last woman remaining in the celebrity version of reality show Gulder Ultimate Search.Kween, Africanbestmovies.com In various interviews she has spoken of how she was discriminated against by her male counterparts in Nigeria's hip- hop industry, and has criticised its females rappers for not persevering in order to earn their place in the music industry.

The island is in the Pacific Ocean near the port of Callao and measures .INEI, Compendio Estadistica 2007, page 24‚Äì25. Sovereignty rights San Lorenzo Island was incorporated in 1899 as territory of the Constitutional Province of Callao by decree of President Andr√©s Avelino C√°ceres Dorregaray. The island was seized by the coup d'√©tat government of Legu√≠a y Salcedo and subsequently adoled out to navy sequestration in 1926. Under the unique status that Callao holds as Peru's only constitutionally formed province/region and without a change of status quo tilted in favor of a republic under civilian control, resolution of conflict over de facto vs de jure land use of San Lorenzo Island remains for global opinion and Peru's Supreme Court to resolve. Access , San Lorenzo is not open to the public. It is a restricted zone controlled by the Marina de Guerra del Per√∫; in rare cases, specialized professionals (archaeologists, naturalists, etc.) may apply for and receive extraordinary permission to land on the island. Civilian vessels are required to maintain a distance of at least from the shore of the island. Geography Only eight kilometers long and two kilometers wide, San Lorenzo is the largest island in Peru. Its lack of fresh water has precluded urbanisation, although there are many projects to do so, including a bridge to connect the District of La Punta in nearby Callao with the island. Nearby is the small island of El Front√≥n, which is separated by a channel 800 m wide, called El Boqueron, and Palomino Islands, known for its populations of sea lions. Its maximum height is the Cerro La Mina at 396 m above sea level. History San Lorenzo has some archeological interest and includes artifacts of Incan and pre-Incan origin. It was used during the Battle of Callao as a burial place; its current under-use by the Peruvian Navy has led, in the first decades of the twenty- first century, to a new de facto status as an unlisted marine bioreserve, being the home to many creatures, notably scallops, seabirds, and sea lions. The island never had permanent human occupation due to lack of freshwater sources. It was constantly visited by people of ancient Peru who used it as a cemetery. In fact in the mythology of ancient Peru central coast marine islands were related to the afterlife. The island was an important part in various stages of colonial Peruvian history, and for strengthening the independence of Peru and the Spanish-South American. During colonial times, stones that were used to build various buildings like the old Presidio of Callao and the Royal Fortress Felipe were extracted from the quarries. It was also, eventually, home base for several English and Dutch pirates, as Francis Drake and Jacques l'Hermite, who raided Callao. The latter died of plague along with some of his men and was buried on the island. In 1866, in republican times, the Spanish Armada retreated to San Lorenzo after their defeat by Peruvian forces in the Battle of Callao, on 2 May. There the Spanish repaired their ships and buried their dead before leaving the Peruvian coast. Charles Darwin explored the island in 1835 looking at the geology and nature. Subsequently, between 1906 and 1907, Max Uhle made the first excavations at the southern tip of the island, finding metal objects and mummies in a pre- Hispanic cemetery in the Caleta de la Cruz, that corresponds to the end of Intermediate and Late Horizon (AD 900 to 1.532). In 1912 President Guillermo Billinghurst raised the proposal of building a dyke across the sea to Callao, an initial study being conducted by Dutch engineer J. Kraus in 1914. In 1958, the proposal was raised again by the Danish firm Christian & Nielsen, who put together a project that involved the transfer to the island of the fishing port and the creation of a new commercial port. The project did not materialize because of financial problems, lack of potable water and the impact that would have been caused on the island's wildlife. In the first half of the 1990s, the naval base located on the island served as a temporary prison for the recently captured then leaders of the insurgent groups Shining Path and MRTA (Abimael Guzm√°n and V√≠ctor Polay, respectively), as maximum security prisons were built for them. In February 2010 the National Institute of Culture declared twenty existing archaeological monuments on the island \\"Cultural Patrimony of the Nation\\". Future development The future San Lorenzo is the subject of ongoing debate. With vast potential for development, a popular suggestion is to link San Lorenzo to the mainland by building a bridge to the nearby La Punta peninsula. This would allow development of the island as a tourist destination and as a megaport and airport similarly to Valpara√≠so. Opponents of this plan suggest that the Peruvian Navy should continue control of the island or that it becomes a fully protected nature reserve.

According to commission chairman Sergey Naryshkin, the tasks of the commission would not be to \\"re-write\\" or \\"politicise\\" history in the manner of countries like Latvia and Lithuania. Instead, the commission would analyse alleged falsifications of historical facts aimed at tarnishing Russia's international reputation, and advise the Russian president on the ways in which such alleged falsifications can be countered. It was foreseen that the commission would meet at least twice per year. The commission was staffed by then current and former State Duma members, such as Natalia Narochnitskaya, Sergey Markov and Konstantin Zatulin, and officials of Russia's armed forces and FSB, including General of the army Nikolay Makarov. Among the twenty-eight members were five professional historians: Andrey Artizov (the head of the Federal Archive Agency),Artizov biography at arhidelo.ru Alexander Chubaryan (the head of the Institute of World History of the Russian Academy of Sciences)Chubaryan biography at planetguide.info Natalia Narochnitskaya, Andrey Sakharov (before 2010 the head of the Institute of Russian History of the Russian Academy of Sciences) and Nikolai Svanidze. Reception In Russia = In an interview with the website Liberty.ru, historian Alexander Dyukov has said that \\"only those who falsify history need fear the work of the commission\\". Russian opposition politicians attacked the commission as effectively reintroducing state ideology for the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union, which is explicitly forbidden by the Constitution of Russia. According to former Duma deputy, Vladimir Ryzhkov of the Russian Republican Party, the Commission and new legislation criminalizing criticism of the Soviet Union allows the state to impose its own idea of political will and ideology and was also part of a continuing rehabilitation of Stalin and the former Soviet dictator's policies. Human rights activist and former lawmaker Lev Ponomaryov dubbed the decree openly totalitarian and claimed that it discredited President Medvedev as a lawyer. Mikhail Gorbachev has also expressed disapproval of Medvedev's decree. Some Russian media and individual opposition journalists also criticised the developments. The business daily Vedomosti noted the name of the commission leaves the way clear for the falsification of history in favor of Russia, establishing a \\"cult of victory\\"similar to the civil religions upon which authoritarian and totalitarian states have been built in the past. Journalist and author Yulia Latynina compared the Commission to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four: \\"The whole idea was copied from Orwell's 1984 and from the famous phrase about Russia as a country with unpredictable past.\\" According to the newspaper Vremya Novostei, the struggle over historical truth in Russia declared at the highest level has taken grotesque form as an article by historian Sergey Kovalyov published on the official website of the Russian Ministry of Defence blamed Poland for starting World War II. Kovalyov's article has since been removed from the Ministry's website mil.ru, but the text is still available via Google's cached HTML version: (as of 8 June 2009). Historian Roy Medvedev criticized the commission for the numbers of professional historians there; he counted three members as historians out of actual five, stating \\"even they are not recognized among professionals.\\" = Outside Russia = The legislation received criticism in many countries, mainly former Warsaw Pact and former Soviet republics. The Baltic states argue about the recognition of the occupation, Ukraine disputes the famine in 1930s, and Poland argues the massacre in Katyn. Critics said the official view from Moscow glossed over Soviet-era crimes. In many countries the years of the Soviet Union are seen as hostile Soviet occupations. Some critics, like Heorhiy Kasyanov from the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, said the Kremlin was trying to whitewash Soviet history in order to justify its denial of human rights: \\"It's part of the Russian Federation's policy to create an ideological foundation for what is happening in Russia right now.\\" Historian and author Orlando Figes, a professor at the University of London, who views the new commission is part of a clampdown on historical scholarship, stated: \\"They're idiots if they think they can change the discussion of Soviet history internationally, but they can make it hard for Russian historians to teach and publish. It's like we're back to the old days.\\" Professor Steven Blank of the U.S. Army War College found the formation of the commission to be a further regress toward Soviet and Stalinist practices, glorifying Soviet empire and its crimes. The Economist found the commission and the law to be a demand \\"that other countries abandon complexity and fit their history into the Soviet straitjacket\\" and notes that although it was hard to explain Stalin's crimes convincingly during Soviet era, the same work for Russian propagandists is even harder.  Kremlin responses to critics  According to the Kremlin, the History Commission was needed as there were increasingly aggressive attempts to rewrite history to Russia's disadvantage. Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin lawmaker and member of the commission, said the new body wouldn't throw people in jail or blacklist historians whose analyses it disagrees with. Its priority, he said, was to challenge what he said were distorted interpretations of the Soviet Union's role in World War II. Nezavisimaya Gazeta published the responses of historian Natalya Narochnitskaya, who said: \\"they try to convince us that it was not we who won the Great Patriotic War, that it was Americans.\\" Regarding attempts at equating the Communism imposed on Eastern Europe with Nazism, she claimed that, \\"agrarian peoples: Czechs, Poles, Romanians, Hungarians left us with violins, professors, academicians, cinematographers, whereas Hitler planned for them fates of pig herders and janitors.\\" Dissolution of the Commission A presidential decree issued on 14 February 2012, invalidated all the prior legislation concerning the commission, thus dismantling it. Its former member historian Alexander Chubarian said that the commission had fulfilled its task leaving a certain legacy behind,–Æ–ª–∏—è –ö–∞–Ω—Ç–æ—Ä. –ë–µ–∑ —Ñ–∞–ª—å—Å–∏—Ñ–∏–∫–∞—Ü–∏–π . –ú–æ—Å–∫–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏–µ –Ω–æ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–∏, ‚Ññ 238, 19 –º–∞—Ä—Ç–∞ 2012 –≥. whereas the State Hermitage director Mikhail Piotrovsky and historian Viktor Pleshkov commented that it had been ineffective and useless.

Cambridgeshire"},{"id":"22873611","text":"Martin Legassick (1940-2016) was a South African historian and Marxist activist. He died on 1 March 2016 after a battle with cancer. He was one of the central figures in the \\"revisionist\\" school of South African historiography that, drawing on Marxism, revolutionised the study of the social formation of Apartheid by highlighting the importance of political economy, class contradictions and imperialism. He was also a key figure in the independent left in South Africa from the 1970s, and a critic, from the left, of many of the analytical and strategic positions taken by the African National Congress and the South African Communist Party, as well as their understanding of South African history. The author of numerous books, mainly on the history of colonialism and capitalism, he collected many of his key political writings in his 2007 book Towards Socialist Democracy. Early life Legassick was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. In 1947 he and his parents emigrated to South Africa. He attended the Diocesan College in Cape Town. In 1960 he became a Rhodes Scholar at Balliol College, Oxford. He later completed his PhD at the University of California. He then worked at universities in the United Kingdom and Tanzania, where he became active in the ANC and the South African Congress of Trade Unions (SACTU) in exile. Together with Giovanni Arrighi, John S. Saul and others he developed an influential politico-economic analysis focusing on the contradictions engendered by the proletarianisation and dispossession of the Southern African peasantry. According to Arrighi, \\"Martin Legassick and Harold Wolpe...maintained that South African Apartheid was primarily because the regime had to become more repressive of the African labour force because it was fully proletarianized, and could no longer subsidize capital accumulation as it had done in the past.\\" Student activism In the 1970s, Legassick became involved in the independent left. In 1979, together with Paula Ensor, Dave Hemson and Rob Petersen, he was suspended from the African National Congress for allegedly forming a faction. They were involved in the exiled African National Congress. They regarded their suspension as undemocratic and launched the Marxist Workers Tendency of the ANC. Legassick left academia in 1981 to become a full-time anti-apartheid activist, arguing for the transformation of the African National Congress into a revolutionary working class movement, and a socialist solution to South Africa's national and social questions. He was on the editorial committee of the MWT journal, Inqaba yaBasebenzi, and the MWT newspaper, Congress Militant. He was expelled by the ANC in 1985. Academia After the unbanning of the ANC in 1990 he was able to return home to Cape Town where he returned to academia. However, he continued to play a leading role in the MWT of the ANC and was active in working class struggles in the Western Cape. The Marxist Workers' Tendency was affiliated to the Committee for a Workers' International, an international organisation of Trotskyist parties and the newspaper, The Militant. Legassick was expelled from the ANC in 1985. Legassick later became a prominent activist working with the Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign in the 2000s, with Abahlali baseMjondolo,Siyanda ‚Äì Mpola ‚Äì Macassar Village: The War on the Poor Continues with the Mandela Park BackyardersHousing battles in post-Apartheid South Africa: The Case of Mandela Park, Khayelitsha and, more recently, in the Democratic Left Front. In 2007 he was involved in an exchange of open letters with the then National Minister of Housing in South Africa, Lindiwe Sisulu.Exchange of letters between Martin Legassick and Housing Minister Lindiwe Sisulu In May 2009 he was arrested while supporting the Macassar Village Land Occupation near Cape Town. A dominant and consistent theme in Legassick's political work is the building of \\"a mass workers' party\\". The Workers and Socialist Party is a South African political party from the MWT tradition, that takes Legassick's work as an important reference point.

Her daughter, Mrunalini Devi Puar was the Chancellor of The Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda. He also obtained post graduate degree in fine arts from Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda. He was the younger brother of Fatehsinghrao Gaekwad, who was the titular Maharaja of Baroda from 1951 to 1971. In the 26th amendment to the Constitution of India promulgated in 1971, the Government of India abolished all official symbols of princely India, including titles, privileges, and remuneration (privy purses).1\\\\. , \\"Through a constitutional amendment passed in 1971, Indira Gandhi stripped the princes of the titles, privy purses and regal privileges which her father's government had granted.\\" (p 278). 2. Quote: \\"The princes of India - their number and variety reflecting to a large extent the chaos that had come to the country with the break up of the Mughal empire - had lost real power in the British time. Through generations of idle servitude they had grown to specialize only in style. A bogus, extinguishable glamour: in 1947, with Independence, they had lost their state, and Mrs. Gandhi in 1971 had, without much public outcry, abolished their privy purses and titles.\\" (pp 37-38). 3.

Quote: \\"The third stage in the political evolution of the princes from rulers to citizens occurred in 1971, when the constitution ceased to recognize them as princes and their privy purses, titles, and special privileges were abolished.\\" (page 84). 5. Quote: \\"Her success at the polls emboldened Mrs. Gandhi to act decisively against the princes. Through 1971, the two sides tried and failed to find a settlement. The princes were willing to forgo their privy purses, but hoped at least to save their titles. But with her overwhelming majority in Parliament, the prime minister had no need to compromise. On 2 December she introduced a bill to amend the constitution and abolish all princely privileges. It was passed in the Lok Sabha by 381 votes to six, and in the Rajya Sabha by 167 votes to seven. In her own speech, the prime minister invited 'the princes to join the elite of the modern age, the elite which earns respect by its talent, energy and contribution to human progress, all of which can only be done when we work together as equals without regarding anybody as of special status.' \\" (page 441). 6.

In 1990 the church yard was flanked by a massive water oak tree that measured 20 feet in circumference. This church still stands and remained in good condition as of 2000. Worship services are held each week. The Baptist church, built in 1903, features a rose window that is also typical of the late Federal style. Several water oak trees, each 15 feet in circumference, once enfolded the church, but are no longer standing due to bad weather and storms. One of the oldest homes in Carpenter built during the 1800s is the home of William L. Lloyd, a pioneer settler who donated the land for the depot and became the first depot agent. By 1970, the local Illinois Central Railroad line had closed down; the Carpenter depot was dismantled in the 1970s. By 2000, most residents were descendants of the pioneering families. Carpenter was once home to eight general stores, a box factory, a blacksmith, two sawmills, and a drug store. The community was also served by a school and several churches.

He is a winner of the Sz√©chenyi Prize. Paul Erd≈ës's favorite \\"child\\", he discovered theorems at the age of 16. Since 2002, he has worked at the R√©nyi Institute of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences; earlier he was at the E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University, at the Departments of Mathematical Analysis, Computer Science.  Biography  He was born in Budapest, Hungary on December 9, 1947. His father was a chemist, his mother a mathematics teacher. He was a child prodigy. While still in elementary school, the educator R√≥zsa P√©ter, friend of his mother introduced him to Paul Erd≈ës, who invited him for lunch in a restaurant, and bombarded him with mathematical questions. P√≥sa finished the problems sooner than his soup, which impressed Erd≈ës, who himself had been a child prodigy, and who supported young talents with much care and competence. That is how P√≥sa‚Äôs first paper was born, co-authored with Erd≈ës (hence his Erd≈ës number is 1). He went to the first special mathematics class of the country at Fazekas Mih√°ly Secondary School from 1962 to 1966, where his classmates included Mikl√≥s Laczkovich, L√°szl√≥ Lov√°sz, J√≥zsef Pelik√°n, Zsolt Baranyai, Istv√°n Berkes, Katalin Vesztergombi, P√©ter Major. He won the first prize on the International Mathematical Olympiad in 1966 (Bulgaria) and second prize in 1965 (Germany). He started his Mathematics studies at ELTE University in 1966, and graduated in 1971. From 1971 to 1982 he worked at the Department of Mathematical Analysis at ELTE University, and he obtained a doctorate in 1983 with his dissertation about Hamiltonian circuits of random graphs. From 1984 to 2002 he worked at the Department of Computer Science at ELTE University, and since 2002 he has been a member of the R√©nyi Mathematical Institute. Despite his significant results in mathematical research, he stopped research and devoted himself fully to Mathematics Education. Erd≈ës, who preferred him among all his prot√©g√©s, expressed his regret that P√≥sa had stopped research with the typical Erd≈ës style phrase \\"P√≥sa is dead.\\" Mathematics education He started teaching mathematics very early. He tutored his secondary school classmates, and during his first year at university he started teaching extracurricular courses at his former secondary school. His students at that time included: L√°szl√≥ Babai, Gy√∂rgy Elekes, P√©ter Komj√°th, Imre Z. Ruzsa. At the beginning of the 1970s he got involved with the school reform movement called complex teaching of mathematics led by Tam√°s Varga. P√≥sa worked on the reform of secondary mathematics teaching, while he taught at Radn√≥ti Mikl√≥s Secondary School from 1976 to 1980. From 1982 to 1989 he was a member of the Research Group on Mathematics Education led by J√°nos Sur√°nyi. From 1982 to 1991 he had two experimental classes at E√∂tv√∂s J√≥zsef Secondary School. His teaching materials written at that time were tested in several classes, and based on these he and colleagues have written a textbook series for the four years of secondary school. Nevertheless, P√≥sa is best known for finding and teaching gifted students. Since 1988 he has been organizing his own week-end maths camps. There are several groups of 20-35 students, and each group has two or three camps a year. In a camp, students mostly work in groups of 2-4, but there are also plenary sessions where they discuss solutions, and sum up important thoughts. Students work on problems carefully built on each other. There are several topics running parallelly, and one topic spans several camps. The emphasis is on thinking, proving, and the connection between seemingly distant ideas. The camps are also an important scene of teacher training, as prospective teachers observe and help in the camps.  Mathematical research  * He gave sufficient conditions for the existence of Hamiltonian circuit. * He proved that a random graph on n vertices with cn log n edges almost surely contains a Hamiltonian circuit, thus affirming a conjecture of Erd≈ës and R√©nyi (also proved by A. D. Korshunov). The result was later improved by Koml√≥s and Szemer√©di. * With Erd≈ës he proved the Erd≈ës‚ÄìP√≥sa theorem.

Nam was born in Lynbrook, New York on March 25, 1926, and currently resides in Tallahassee, Florida. He was a Professor of Sociology for 31 years with one of his most important contributions being the Nam-Powers Index measuring occupational status. Education Charles Nam attended an Army Specialized Training Program at Harvard University in 1944, completed his Bachelor of Arts in Applied Statistics at New York University in 1950 and attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for both his Master‚Äôs degree in Sociology (1957) as well as his Ph.D (1959). Career Charles Nam began his professional career at the Census Bureau in 1950. For more than three years, he was employed in the International Population Statistics Section, assisting subject matter specialists in the social statistics field. Following his time at the US Bureau of the Census, Charles Nam work for the US Air Force Human Resource Research Institute as an assistant project director on demographic studies of officers and airmen, leaving this position to attend graduate school. While pursuing his masters and PhD he was a research assistant on various demographic research projects at the University of North Carolina Institute for Research in Social Science, returning to the Census (1957) prior to completing his doctorate in sociology (1960). At the US Bureau of the Census (1957‚Äì1964) Nam was chief of the Education Statistics Section (1957‚Äì1961), helping to plan the 1960 census, preparing Current Population reports, and helping to train foreign students in census techniques. Later (1962‚Äì1964), Nam was the Chief of the Education and Social Stratification Branch where he was responsible for education, stratification and other social data. During this time he also was the project director for a study matching death certificates to census records. Leaving the US Bureau of the Census in 1964, Nam began his 31-year academic career at Florida State University. During the course of his academic career, he chaired the Department of Sociology and founded the Population and Manpower Research Center (which later became the Center for the Study of Population and even later became the Center for Demography and Population Health). He directed the center for its first 14 years and was Associate Center Director again for the early 1990s. Nam is the author or co-author of more than a dozen books. He wrote Education of the American Population with John Folger in 1967, and The Socioeconomic Approach to Status Measurement with Mary Powers in 1983. He co-wrote two handbooks on immigration (International Handbook of Internal Migration with David F. Sly and William Serow in 1990 and Handbook of International Migration with William Serow, David Sly and Robert Weller in 1990). Living and Dying in the USA: Health, Behavioral and Social Forces of Adult Mortality (2002) was his last academic book written in English. Most recently, he published The Golden Door, an historical novel (2006). One of his most important contributions was his work on the Nam-Powers Index, which was developed in the 1950s and expanded upon by Nam and several colleagues (specifically Mary Powers, E. Walter Terrie and Monica Boyd) over the years (see Nam and Boyd 2004 for details). The Nam- Powers index was created to estimate the living conditions of a typical person in a particular occupation. This work was highlighted in several of Charles Nam‚Äôs publications and has been adopted by sociologists as one of the key measures of socioeconomic status (typically measured by education, income and occupation). Over the course of his academic career his research was funded by more than a dozen different agencies, totaling more than a million dollars in grant funding from agencies like the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the US Department of Education, and the National Science Foundation, among others. Charles Nam has also published extensively, with nearly two dozen articles in the demography and sociology of education, another near-dozen in social stratification, another 17 in general demography and more than two dozen focusing on mortality. These publications have been included in some of the most prestigious journals in his field: Demography, American Sociological Review, Social Forces, Population Research and Policy Review, Population and Environment, Social Biology, and Social Science & Medicine. One of his articles was highlighted in a commemorative issue of Social Biology as one of their thirty most frequently cited articles in the journal‚Äôs history (Sex Predetermination: Its Impact on Fertility, with Gerald Markle). Beyond publishing and conducting funded research, Nam also had major editorial roles at Sociology of Education, Demography, Population and Environment, Journal of the American Statistical Association, Population Research and Policy Review, and Social Biology. He was President of the Population Association of America (1979) and the Southern Sociological Society (1981‚Äì1982). He was founder and chair of the American Sociological Association‚Äôs Section on Sociology of Population (1976‚Äì1978). He was named a fellow of the American Statistical Association (1980), the American Association for the Advancement of Science (2001) and the Southern Demographic Association (2001) (where he was also named Honorary President in 2007 for having been a founding member who never accepted the Presidency).

His mother was Anna Maria, daughter of Julines Hering. He was educated at St John's College, Cambridge. In 1836 he assumed by Royal licence the additional and principal surname of Savile. Political career Scarbrough was returned to Parliament for Nottinghamshire in 1826, a seat he held until 1832, when the constituency was abolished. He then sat for Nottinghamshire North until 1835, when he succeeded his father in the earldom and entered the House of Lords. He also served as Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire from 1839 to 1856. Family memorial, St Helen's Saxby, Lincolnshire Lord Scarbrough never married. However, he had five natural children, four sons and one daughter. He bequeathed his large property at Rufford, Nottinghamshire, to his second son Captain Henry Lumley (d. 1881), and on his death they passed to the fourth son, Augustus William Lumley (1829-1887). On the latter's death they were inherited by Lord Scarbrough's eldest natural son by a woman of French origin, John Lumley-Savile, who assumed the surname of Savile only. He was a prominent diplomat and was created Baron Savile in 1888. Lord Scarbrough died in October 1856, aged 68, and was succeeded in the earldom by his first cousin once removed, Richard Lumley.

A multi- talented person, she was fluent in Latin, Spanish, and Italian, and an accomplished musician, needleworker and algorist. A member of a very prominent and wealthy mercantile family holding royal favour and civic office, her marriage united common interests within the Company of Merchant Taylors. Epitaph Elizabeth Lucar was born and died in London and is largely known from an inscription on her tomb in St Laurence Pountney church, London, written or commissioned by her husband Emanuel Lucar (1494‚Äì1574), a man held in high esteem among the Merchant Taylors. This was recorded by John Stow.J. Strype, A Survey of the Cities of London and Westminster (1720 edition, expanded from the 1598 Survey of London by John Stow), Book 2, Chapter 12 (Candlewick Ward, St Lawrence Poultney), p. 189.

Carvalho referred to an essay on the subject of calligraphy written by Elizabeth Lucar in 1525, at the age of 15, entitled Curious Calligraphy.D.N. Carvalho, Forty Centuries of Ink, or, A Chronological Narrative concerning Ink and its Backgrounds (Banks Law Publishing Co., New York 1904), pp. 106-07. This, he claimed, was the first English essay on that subject, and this claim has been repeated elsewhere. However the bibliographic or manuscript original of this supposed work Curious Calligraphy is not cited or apparent, and the term 'calligraphy' itself appears anachronistic for English usage of that date.Worldcat first offers 'calligraphy' in an original book title in Guillaume Le Gangneur and Simon de Vries, La caligraphie, ou, Belle √©criture de la lettre grecque (Paris, 1599); The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (3rd Edition, 1964 revision) dates its English usage from 1613. The word 'curious' carries the old sense of 'skilled' or 'careful'. Ballard, in his 1752 Memoir of Elizabeth Lucar, does not mention an essay but described her as 'a curious calligrapher'.Memoirs of Several Ladies, p. 36. It is possible that Carvalho, reading the line of her epitaph 'She wrought all Needle workes that women exercise', interpreted it to mean 'she wrote (of) all needle workes'. The duality of meaning of 'wrought' and 'wrote' has been recognized elsewhere, but in either sense, that line may only mean that she herself delineated the patterns which she afterwards rendered in needlework. The line 'Three manner hands could she write, them faire all' does however indicate that she could write beautifully in three different scripts.Consult: S. Frye, Pens and Needles: Women's Textualities in Early Modern England (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011), pp. 1-2.

Whiffling is a term used in ornithology to describe the behavior whereby a bird rapidly descends with a zig-zagging, side-slipping motion. Sometimes to whiffle, a bird flies briefly with its body turned upside down but with its neck and head twisted 180 degrees around in a normal position. The aerodynamics which usually give a bird lift during flying are thereby inverted and the bird briefly plummets toward the ground before this is quickly reversed and the bird adopts a normal flying orientation. This erratic motion resembles a falling leaf, and is used to avoid avian predators or may be used by geese (family Anatidae) to avoid a long, slow descent over an area where wildfowling is practised. The behavior is seen in several species including lesser yellowlegs (Tringa flavipes), the black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), the northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), geese (e.g. pink-footed goose (Anser brachyrhynchus)), three species of scoter (Melanitta), and other members of the family Anatidae.

History  Honeysuckle was established in 1992 as a public/private partnership between the Government of New South Wales, represented by the Honeysuckle Development Corporation, and private developers. The partnership was granted responsibility for the commercial and residential renewal of derelict industrial land along the Newcastle railway line and waterfront. Available land was divided into seven precincts: Carrington, Cottage Creek, Honeysuckle, Hunter Street, Linwood, Marina and Wickham. Each precinct was intended to develop its own character and commercial or residential property mix, and to advance to completion and market sale independent of each other. In 2003 the, Honeysuckle Development Corporation merged with the Government's Regional Land Development Corporation to form the Hunter Development Corporation.Honeysuckle - About HDC, 2005, accessed 20 May 2009, http://www.honeysuckle.net/pages/hdc/index.php Various private developers have contributed to Honeysuckle's mix of commercial and residential development.  Development  Lee Wharf, Honeysuckle Commercial development has occurred in all seven Honeysuckle precincts, but with its greatest focus in Cottage Creek. Local water authority Hunter Water, local legal firm Sparke Helmore, and international consultancy Price Waterhouse Coopers have established offices in Honeysuckle along Honeysuckle Drive. The Crowne Hotel occupies the Honeysuckle Precinct in the eastern extremity of Honeysuckle and the Ibis Hotel occupies the Hunter Street Precinct. A strip of restaurants and bars occupy the Honeysuckle Precinct, which has become known as The Boardwalk. The Marina Precinct incorporates a redeveloped Fish Co-Op, the Newcastle Cruising Yacht Club, two seafood restaurants, and a fish shop. The overall Honeysuckle development has also preserved a number of heritage- listed buildings along Newcastle Harbour, including the former railway work sheds which now house The Forum, the Newcastle Regional Museum and space for community activities. Multistorey residential apartments with ground floor retail and restaurant/cafe space are located in the Honeysuckle Precinct and medium density townhouses occupy the Linwood Precinct. These are largely aimed at middle income earners looking for an inner-city lifestyle. Honeysuckle however has committed $25 million to community housing, and through Newmacq Community Housing, people on low to medium incomes who meet the criteria of Affordable Rental Program can access some rental properties in Honeysuckle.  Criticism  The Honeysuckle development utilised a top-down, modernist, rational model based on similar urban renewal projects worldwide, such as New York's Battery Park City, London‚Äôs Canary Wharf, and Melbourne‚Äôs Docklands. The commonality between these developments is that they focused on physical planning around city centres where new buildings, markets, and hotels attempt to 'revitalise' the city.Krumholz, N (1999) 'Equitable approaches to local economic development,' Policy Studies Journal, 27, 1, pp. 83-97 Studies suggest this planning approach can focus on the technical expertise at the expense of public participation in the decision making process.Taylor, N, Urban Planning Theory Since 1945, London 1998 pp.75-91  References  Category:Newcastle, New South Wales Category:Urban renewal ","title":"Honeysuckle, Newcastle"},{"id":"22874491","title":"Michelle Fischbach"},{"id":"22874492","text":"Neendakara is a suburb of Kollam city in Kerala, India.

Members of the Institute are of different nationalities. They are persons that have particularly distinguished themselves through competence or activities in fields of specific interest to the Organisation. Institutions significantly contributing to the work of the Institute may also be admitted as members. Qualified persons and academic institutions, as also nations and international intergovernmental organisations contributing to the activities of the Institute, may be admitted as Associate members but may not vote.  Training and activities  The Institute provides an annual programme of training activities in International Humanitarian Law (IHL), Refugee Law and associated subjects. These activities are designed for a diverse, international and multicultural audience with participation welcomed from military personnel, government officials, diplomats, experts, representatives of non-governmental organisations and students from around the world. Our courses, often conducted in collaboration with interested international institutions and countries, are delivered in various languages (English, French, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Russian and Portuguese) either in Sanremo or in collaboration with partner institutions around the world. = Military courses on law of armed conflict (LOAC), international humanitarian law (IHL) and related subjects = To foster the development of knowledge in International Humanitarian Law, the Institute structures its training at three levels, which develop progressively and all emphasise the practical application of IHL: * IHL Foundation Courses: provide personnel with a practical introduction to the Law of Armed Conflict delivered from an operational military perspective; * Advanced Courses on IHL: an intensive course designed for experienced military/civilian legal advisers, military officers and those from Government or International Organisations with an in depth knowledge of IHL/LOAC; * Specialised IHL Courses: aimed at personnel who require an enhanced practical understanding of a specific area of IHL. Among these specific training programmes: Courses for Directors of Training Programmes in IHL; the Peace Support Operations Course; the Detention and Captured Persons Course; the Targeting Course; the Rules of Engagement Course; the Naval Operations and the Law Course. * IHL Workshops: designed to address the needs of the IHL practitioners who face the most difficult legal challenges in the field. These activities are usually of shorter duration with less formal training. The emphasis is on the exchange of views and experiences between participants and instructors in order to reach a deeper understanding of the subject and thus provide a cutting-edge perspective. At all levels of training, the Institute aims at complementing plenary presentations with interactive discussion, debate and exercises designed to strengthen each participant‚Äôs knowledge and facilitate the sharing of different national approaches and best practice. = International Refugee law, Statelessness, Internal Displacement and Migration law courses = Courses in these areas aim at filling the gaps in knowledge and skills of government and civil society officials engaged in work with people in need of protection. Through its training, capacity-building, and horizontal sharing of experiences, the Institute advocates for the safeguarding of rights in a way that complements and adds on the efforts of donors in the field of protection of refugees, IDPs, stateless persons and migrants. These training programmes strike a fine balance between theory and practice, allowing the audience to exchange experiences and ideas, and utilize the participants‚Äô existing skills to deal with complex legal issues in a pragmatic manner. These courses are delivered in close collaboration with UNHCR and other key partners such as the IOM, the Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons and the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. = International Disaster Law course = The course is jointly organized by the International Institute of Humanitarian Law in collaboration with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the International Disaster Law Project, the Italian Red Cross and the EU Jean Monnet Module on ‚ÄúInternational and European Disaster Law‚Äù Roma Tre University. The course on International Disaster Law offers participants a unique opportunity to analyse one of today‚Äôs most important legal challenges: the prevention and management of natural and man-made disasters. The programme seeks to offer a comprehensive overview of the main practical, diplomatic and military issues related to the legal aspects of disaster prevention and management activities. Topics will be covered using a plenary-based approach complemented by practical exercises designed to test participants‚Äô ability to find effective solutions through the application of relevant IDL provisions. = Organisation of conferences, workshops and round tables = These events are much appreciated by the international community as they offer an opportunity for periodic dialogue and debate on topics of international humanitarian law, human rights and other related issues. They encourage members of scientific, diplomatic, institutional and military circles from all over the world to meet informally to examine the more burning issues concerning the promotion of, respect for and development of international humanitarian law with an eye to the future. Almost forty years of meetings and intense academic activity addressing the main topics of humanitarian law, under the auspices of the Institute, have created what has universally become known as ‚Äúhumanitarian dialogue in the spirit of Sanremo‚Äù.  The Sanremo Round Table  The Sanremo Round Table on current issues of international humanitarian law represent the milestone of the activities of the International Institute of Humanitarian Law. It encourages members of scientific, diplomatic, institutional and military circles from all over the world to meet informally and to examine the more burning issues concerning the promotion of, respect for and development of international humanitarian law with an eye to the future. After almost 50 years, the Sanremo Round Table have tackled several crucial IHL topics at the top of the international agenda, including, in the last years, ‚ÄúDeprivation of Liberty and Armed Conflicts: Exploring Realities and Remedies‚Äù (2018), ‚ÄúThe Additional Protocols 40 Years Later: New Conflicts, New Actors, New Perspectives‚Äù (2017), ‚ÄúWeapons and International Rule of Law‚Äù (2016), ‚ÄúThe Distinction between International and Non-International Armed Conflicts‚Äù (2015), ‚ÄúConduct of Hostilities: the Practice, the Law and the Future‚Äù (2014), ‚ÄúRespecting IHL: Challenges and Responses‚Äù (2013), ‚ÄúPrivate, Military and Security Companies‚Äù (2012).  Research and publications  The Institute has become increasingly involved in research activities, study and analysis. It publishes texts, essays and monographs that aim to contribute to the awareness of issues relevant to international humanitarian law and its different aspects, refugee law and migration law. The \\"Sanremo Manual on International Law applicable to Armed Conflict at Sea\\", which was compiled between 1988 and 1994, still remains the most consulted manual at Naval Military Academies all over the world and an essential work of reference on a global scale. The San Remo Manual is currently being updated by international experts and practitioners. The \\"Sanremo Handbook on the Rules of Engagement (RoE)\\", published in November 2009, represents the only work of this type which sets out to explain in a practical way the complex procedures and methodology governing the development and implementation of Rules of Engagement. It has been translated into the 6 official languages of the United Nations as well as Bosnian, Hungarian and Thai. More recently the Institute supported the drafting of the \\"UNESCO Manual on the Protection of Cultural Property\\". The Manual, compiled by a team of internationally-renowned experts, serves as a practical guide to the implementation by military forces of the rules governing the protection of cultural property in the event of armed conflict. It combines a military- focused account of the international legal obligations of states and individuals with suggestions as to best practice at the different levels of command during the conducting of military operations by land, sea or air. The \\"Manual on the Law of Non-International Armed Conflict\\" which was published in March 2006, reflects the developments registered by humanitarian rules at a time where conflicts too often differ from classical warfare between States bound by the Hague Conventions and the Geneva Protocols. The \\"Handbook on Integrating Gender Perspectives into International Operations\\" ‚Äì the Sanremo Handbook on Gender ‚Äì was published on 2019 and represents the concrete contribution of the Sanremo Institute to the promotion of gender perspectives with regard to the protection of specific groups of vulnerable individuals in conflict areas. This Handbook, prepared by international civil and military experts convened in Sanremo by the Institute, provides a practical framework for gender mainstreaming in the training of the military, police officers and civilians who are involved in conflict scenarios. For over 20 years now, since 1998, the Institute has then continued to produce a series of publications dedicated to the proceedings of the Round Table on current issues of international humanitarian law. The last Sanremo Round Table, held in Sanremo from 4 to 6 September 2019, addressed the issue of ‚ÄúWhither the human in armed conflict? IHL implications of new technology in warfare‚Äù. Finally, every three months the Institute distributes and publishes on its official website a ‚ÄúNewsletter‚Äù, which describes its important initiatives and activities.

It was founded in 1877 during the rule of the Russian Empire. The factory is located on the left bank of Hrazdan river at the centre of Yerevan, occupying the area of the historic Erivan Fortress. History Nerses Tairyan was a well-known merchant and philanthropist. In 1877 he started industrial production of wine, and later brandy in 1887, at the territory of the former Erivan Fortress. Hovhannes Aivazovsky, who was a relative of Tairyan, helped him to build the factory. In 1899 Nerses Tairyan leased the factory to Nikolay Shustov, who purchased it a year later for 50,000 roubles. Having established his own business in Moscow in 1863, Shustov became one of the first producers of brandy in Russia. Already in the 1870s \\"Shustov and Sons\\" company managed to take into its hands 80% of brandy-wine-vodka-liqueur production in the Russian Empire. In 1901 Nikolay Shustov sent samples of brandy to an exhibition in Paris. The judges, venerable French tasters, unanimously granted Grand Prix to the unknown brandy-maker, but after they found out that he was not French and the brandy was sent from Armenia, they were so astonished, that made an exception for Nikolay Shustov and granted him the privilege to put the word \\"cognac\\" on his labels, instead of \\"brandy\\", as it should naturally be. Thus, Shustov became the first and only foreign wine-maker all throughout the history of brandy- producing, who was honoured with this privilege. Former Sardar palace. The building of the factory was built on the site of this palace In 1899 Shustov invited Kyrill Silchenko, who had just finished Nikitin's school of wine- making, to work at the factory. He worked at the factory devotedly and dedicated all his life to the development of production of wine and brandy. This is why Armenians called him \\"the great Ukrainian son of Armenian people\\". The current facilities of the Yerevan Ararat Brandy Factory were built in 1938 on the site of the former sardar palace of the Erivan Fortress.R. G. Ananikian.

With the help of old papers, museum exhibits, family archives, specialists and technologists of the factory assembled and classified the whole invaluable experience, accumulated throughout the period of plant's functioning, and, consequently, the lost and forgotten glorious name of Armenian Brandy was restored. The factory currently produces several types of Armenian famous brandies including \\"Noy\\" and \\"Araspel\\". \\"Noy\\" is a worldwide well known brandy especially in with its 25-year-old \\"Brandy Noy Tirakal\\".

When she was 18, she took an AFS exchange program to the US and attended Space Camp. Career She studied in Bolzano and Trento and graduated from the Technical University of Munich with a degree in Mechanical Engineering. She studied at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure de l'a√©ronautique et de l'espace in Toulouse, France, and at the Mendeleev Russian University of Chemistry and Technology in Moscow. She graduated in Aeronautics Sciences (University 'Federico II', Naples) at the Accademia Aeronautica in Pozzuoli, becoming one of the first women to be a lieutenant and fighter pilot in the Italian Air Force. She is the second Space Camp alumnus in orbit. As part of her training, she completed the Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot training. She has logged over 500 hours and has flown six types of military aircraft: SF-260, T-37, T-38, MB-339A, MB-339CD and AM-X. In ESA Cristoforetti was officially selected as an astronaut in 2009 by the European Space Agency, from a population of 8000 applicants. Samantha Cristoforetti attired in an EMU suit =Expedition 42/43= Samantha Cristoforetti in a special sleep bag that stops the person from drifting around in the micro-g environment of ISS. On 3 July 2012, the European Space Agency announced that Cristoforetti was set for a long-duration mission to the ISS in 2014. On 23 November 2014, Soyuz TMA-15M, carrying Cristoforetti and two other astronauts launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan. It successfully docked at the International Space Station roughly six hours later. Cristoforetti, along with her crew mates, returned safely from the ISS on 11 June 2015. She stayed 199 days in space and so became the holder of the record for the longest single mission for a woman. Previously, the NASA astronaut Sunita Williams held that record with 195 days after her Expedition 33 mission to the ISS. Cristoforetti's record was beaten on 5 June 2017 by Peggy Whitson during Expedition 52 and on 28 December 2019 by Christina Koch during Expedition 60. Cristoforetti's mission to the ISS was called Futura. During her stay she performed numerous scientific experiments simulating prolonged stay in space and Lunar and Mars orbit. She was the primary operator during the undocking of the ATV-5. In February 2015, she began the outreach program \\"Mission X: Train Like an Astronaut\\", where students 8‚Äì12 years old were challenged to get fit during a nine-week program, while Cristoforetti trained in space. Other outreach activities included learning how the Spirulina algae can be a source of food, while creating photosynthesis in a recycled air environment. Cristoforetti was slated for 1, up to possibly 3, space walks, however when part of her personal EVA equipment was lost due to the failed launch of the Orbital Cygnus Orb-3 mission in October 2014, those EVAs were scrapped.

He was Speaker of the English House of Commons during the Short Parliament. He supported the Royalist cause in the English Civil War.  Life  Glanville was the son of Sir John Glanville the elder, of Broad Hinton in Wiltshire. His father was a judge and Member of Parliament. Glanville was brought up as an attorney, but entered Lincoln's Inn and was called to the bar on 6 February 1610. He was Recorder of Plymouth from 1614.W R Williams Parliamentary History of the County of Gloucester He was elected Member of Parliament for Liskeard in 1614. In 1621 he was elected MP for Plymouth and was re-elected in 1624. He was secretary to the Lord Admiral of the Fleet during the Duke of Buckingham's assault on C√°diz in 1625, and managed several of the articles of his impeachment over the next three years. He was re- elected MP for Plymouth in 1625 and opposed the Crown in the 1620s, preparing a protest against the dissolution of Parliament in 1625. He was re-elected MP for Plymouth in 1626 and 1628, and sat until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. At some time he was proctor for the dean and chapter of Windsor. In January 1630, Glanville became a reader of his Inn. He became serjeant-at-law on 20 May 1637 and bencher of his Inn on 14 June 1637. He was Recorder of Bristol from 1638. In April 1640 he was elected MP for Bristol in the Short Parliament when he served Speaker. He spoke so strongly against ship money during his term as Speaker that the court party contrived to prevent him coming down to the House on the day the Short Parliament was dissolved. Nevertheless, he became King's Serjeant on 6 July 1640 and from then onwards he supported the King. In November 1640, he was re- elected MP for Bristol for the Long Parliament. He was knighted on 7 August 1641. He sat in the King's Parliament at Oxford and was awarded DCL from the University of Oxford on 31 January 1644.

He was also the central figure in a circle of 19th-century Bangor painters that included his daughter, Anna Eliza Hardy (1839‚Äì1934), sister Mary Ann Hardy, and pupils Isabel Graham Eaton, Walter Franklin Lansil and George Edward Dale.Diane Vatne and Pauline Kaiser, The Hardy Connection: Bangor Women Artists, 1830-1900 (Bangor Historical Society, 1992) Hardy was born in Pelham, New Hampshire but moved to Hampden, Maine, with his parents in 1811. He first studied painting in Boston under David Brown, and then in New York under Samuel F.B. Morse, who was also the inventor of the telegraph. By 1826 Hardy had moved to Bangor, then a booming lumber port, and stayed for the rest of his life, painting portraits of not only the local elite but Penobscot Indians, the black barber Abraham Hanson, and members of his own family.James B. Vickery, Jeremiah Pearson Hardy: Maine Portraitist (Waterville, Me.: Colby College Art Museum, 1966) Hardy's artistic style developed rapidly after his initial schooling. In the 1820s, he painted several elegant miniatures as well as masterful portraits of his parents and prominent citizens. He filled the walls of his Bangor studio with genre paintings, including studies of his family members painted by candlelight and firelight. By the 1830s, he was painting wealthy Bangor citizens, but needed to travel to other parts of the State to find work. His mature period from 1840-1856 is well documented in a ledger he kept of his artistic transactions. Many of the paintings listed still exist in the Bangor area, particularly in the collections of the Bangor Public Library, Bangor Historical Society, Isaac Farrar Mansion, Bangor Theological Seminary, University of Maine Museum of Art, and the University of Maine's Special Collections at the Fogler Library. By the 1850s, it is clear that the new medium of photography influenced his paintings, and in the 1859-60 Bangor City Directory, Hardy is listed as a portrait painter and photographer with his son Francis. Hardy returned to genre painting in the 1870s, and appears to have painted little in his old age, passing away at age 87 in 1888. Among his extant works are: *Mary Ann Hardy (1821, Collection of Boston Museum of Fine Arts) *Self-portrait (miniature, 1824, Collection of Bowdoin College) *Portrait of Abraham Hanson (1825, Collection of Addison Gallery, Andover, MA) *Sarah Polasses (c. 1828, Collection of Tarratine Club, Bangor, ME) *Lt.

He was tried and executed for high treason, on somewhat dubious evidence, in 1681. Stephen College, 19th century mezzotint. Life He was born about 1635, and worked at the trade of carpentry, hence his nickname \\"the Protestant joiner\\". College was a skilled joiner: evidence of his work still survives to this day, in the form of the wooden panelling that he made for the Stationers Hall in 1674.https://stationers.org/our-heritage/the-stationers- hall.html He became known as an anti-Catholic political speaker. He had been a Presbyterian until the Restoration of 1660 when he conformed to the Church of England. He made himself notorious by his declamations against the papists, by writing and singing political ballads, and by inventing a weapon for self- defence at close quarters, which he called 'the Protestant flail. ' He knew many persons of rank. Lord William Russell and Lady Berkeley showed him kindness, which inspired him with a desire to rise in the world. He was one of the bitterest opponents of Lord Stafford, and exulted over his condemnation and death. Among the writings attributed to him are coarse attacks on lawyers and Catholics. Among these are 'Truth brought to Light, or Murder will out;' 'Justice in Masquerade, or Scroggs upon Scroggs;' another beginning ' Since Justice Scroggs Pepys and Dean did bail;' 'The Pope's Advice and Benediction to his Judge and Jury in Eutopia;' 'The Wolf Justice ' (against Scroggs); 'A Caution,' and 'A Satyr' against James, Duke of York, the Duchess of Portsmouth, and Lord Chief Justice Scroggs, whom he hated for acquitting the royal physician, Sir George Wakeman, of the fabricated charge of attempting to assassinate the King by poison:s:College, Stephen (DNB00) Trial and execution  When Parliament moved to Oxford, in March 1681, College went there on horseback, ostentatiously displaying weapons and wearing defensive armour, speaking threateningly against King Charles II, and advocating resistance.Kenyon p.276 In June 1681, after the condemnation of Edward Fitzharris, College was arrested, carried before Secretary of State Leoline Jenkins on 29 June, and committed to the Tower. He was indicted at the Old Bailey on 8 July for seditious words and actions, but saved by the influence of Slingsby Bethel and Henry Cornish, sheriffs of whig sympathies. They packed a grand jury who returned a verdict of ignoramus, or ‚Äúwe do not know\\" (i.e. \\"we know of no reason why he should stand trial\\"). The government then brought another prosecution, in Oxford. Aaron Smith, a lawyer favoured by William Russell and others of the ‚Äúcountry party‚Äù or whig opposition, wished to defend College, something the understanding at the time of the adversarial system made problematic. Smith attempted through Henry Starkey to bribe the chief gaoler, Murrel, to obtain access to College. Failing, he gained admission by an order from Sir Robert Sawyer, the attorney-general, and gave papers to College. These papers on examination by the authorities were accounted seditious, or beyond the privileges of defensive counsel as then allowed by law. They were therefore seized. Only mutilated copies were given to the prisoner, after long discussion, when the trial began on 17 August 1681, before Lord Norreys, Lord-chief-justice North, and other judges. The prisoner claimed, as a freeman of London, that he should be tried there, but he was told that for offences committed at Oxford he could be tried at Oxford. He pleaded for restoration of his papers, which would have guided him how to challenge the jury, and how to conduct his defence. He kept arguing in a circle, and at last pleaded not guilty. Aaron Smith had next to submit to be browbeaten and to enter into recognisances for his appearance, while Henry Starkey was summoned for attempted bribery. The examination of witnesses lasted until midnight. Stephen Dugdale bore witness of treasonable talk, and that College avowed himself the author of various libels, the pretended 'Letter, intercepted, to Roger L'Estrange', and the ballad of 'The Raree Show,' to the tune of Rochester's 'I am a senseless thing, with a hey.' Other witnesses for the prosecution were Edward Turberville, Masters, Bryan Haynes, the two Macnamaras, and Sir William Jennings. But Shewin, Hickman, and Elizabeth Oliver tried to weaken the credit of Bryan Haynes, and Titus Oates violently assailed Turberville. Witnesses who had formerly been in league against the Catholics were now split. Dugdale, Turberville, and John 'Narrative Smith' swore positively to the guilt of College; Oates, Boldron, and others contradicted their testimony, and exposed the worthlessness of their personal character. At the trial of Lord Stafford, College had been the chief asserter of Dugdale's respectability; now he conducted his own defence by vigorously attacking him. Serjeant Jeffreys argued to the jury that to disbelieve the prosecution witnesses would cast doubt on the Popish Plot itself. He exploited in full the division between the informers, in particular dwelling on the fact that Oates, whom he detested, was not on oath. \\"Here is Dugdale's oath against Dr. Oates' swearing\\" he noted with amusementKenyon pp.276-7 (Oates falsely claimed to be a Doctor of Divinity, and endured much ridicule from Jeffreys as a result).Milne-Tyte p.76 At nearly two o'clock in the morning the jury retired, and in half an hour gave their verdict of guilty. The court then adjourned until ten o'clock, when sentence of death was pronounced against him. He was visited in prison by two of the university divines, Dr. Marshall and Dr. Hall, who declared him to be penitent. His family was admitted to see him, and attempts made to obtain a remission of the sentence, but the sole concession granted was that his quarters should be delivered to his friends. On 31 August he was taken in a cart to the place of execution, and made a long speech, chiefly to clear himself from the charge of being a papist. He was then hanged and quartered. His body was buried the next evening at St. Gregory's Church, by St. Paul's.

In 2001, he received a master's degree from the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure de l'a√©ronautique et de l'espace in Toulouse, France, majoring in space systems and space vehicle mechanics. He spent his final year before graduation at the √âcole Polytechnique de Montr√©al, Canada, as an exchange student on the Aeronautics and Space Master. Pesquet graduated from the Air France flight school in 2006. This led to an Airline Transport Pilot License-Instrument Rating (ATPL-IR). He speaks French, English, Spanish, Chinese, German and Russian, and is a member of the French Aeronautics and Astronautics Association (3AF), and of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA). Career NEEMO 18. From October 2001, Pesquet worked as a spacecraft dynamics engineer on remote sensing missions for GMV, S.A. in Madrid, Spain. Between 2002 and 2004, Pesquet worked at the French space agency, CNES, as a research engineer on space missions autonomy. He also carried out various studies on future European ground segment design and European space technology harmonization. From late 2002, he was a representative of CNES at CCSDS, the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems, working on the topic of cross-support between international space agencies. A private pilot, he was selected in 2004 for Air France's flight training programme. He went on to become a commercial pilot for the French airline, where he started flying the Airbus A320 in 2006. He has logged more than 2000 hours flying time on various commercial airliners, and has qualified as a type-rating flight instructor on the A320, and as a Crew Resource Management instructor. In 2018, Pesquet gained his Airbus A310 type rating and is qualified as a Novespace Zero-G aircraft pilot. ESA career Pesquet was selected as a European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut in May 2009. He joined ESA in September 2009 and successfully completed Astronaut Basic Training in November 2010. Pesquet is the youngest member of the European Astronaut Corps, and the last of the ESA astronaut class of 2009 to arrive in space. On 10 June 2014, NASA announced that Pesquet would serve as an aquanaut aboard the Aquarius underwater laboratory during the NEEMO 18 undersea exploration mission, which began on 21 July 2014 and lasted nine days. He has also taken part in ESA's CAVES underground course in 2011 and NASA's SEATEST II mission in 2013, furthering his experience in exploration. In 2014, Thomas was chosen by ESA for a six-month mission to the International Space Station starting in November 2016. Thomas was also the backup to ESA astronaut Andreas Mogensen who flew to the International Space Station on a 10-day flight in September 2015. =Expedition 50/51= Pesquet during EVA on January 13, 2017 Pesquet launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome onboard Soyuz MS-03 on November 17, 2016. He spent six months on the International Space Station as part of Expedition 50/51. Arriving at the ISS on November 19, 2016, he was the first French astronaut since L√©opold Eyharts helped install the Columbus European laboratory module during Expedition 16. His arrival marked the beginning of the European Proxima mission. Pesquet (Left) and fellow crew members Peggy Whitson (Right) and Oleg Novitsky The Proxima mission included 50 science experiments for ESA and CNES. The mission was named after Proxima Centauri, continuing the French astronauts' tradition of naming the missions after stars and constellations. The X inside the logo symbolizes that Pesquet is the tenth French astronaut as well as the unknown. The Proxima mission name was chosen in a competition, with the winning name given by 13-year-old Samuel Planas from Toulouse, France. The mission logo was designed by Thomas Pesquet and Karen Oldenburg. Pesquet performed his first EVA with astronaut Shane Kimbrough on January 13, 2017. During the EVA, they prepared the infrastructure to replace the ISS batteries. The EVA lasted for 5 hours and 58 minutes. Pesquet holding a photo of ESA colleague Tim Peake holding a photo of fellow ESA astronauts On March 23, 2017, Pesquet performed his second career EVA with Shane Kimbrough. The main objective was to prepare the Pressurized Mating Adapter-3 (PMA-3) for installation of the second International Docking Adapter (IDA), which will accommodate future commercial crew vehicle dockings. The PMA-3 provides the pressurized interface between the station modules and the docking adapter. Expedition 50 Commander Kimbrough and Pesquet disconnected cables and electrical connections on PMA-3 to prepare for its robotic move on March 26, 2017. PMA-3 will be moved from the port side of the Tranquility module to the space-facing side of the Harmony module, where it will become home for the docking adapter, which will be delivered on a future flight of a SpaceX Dragon cargo ship. The spacewalkers also installed on the starboard zero truss (ITS) a new computer relay box equipped with advanced software for the adapter. The two spacewalkers lubricated the latching end effector on the Canadarm2 robotic arm, inspected a radiator valve suspected of a small ammonia leak and replaced cameras on the Japanese segment of the outpost. Radiators are used to shed excess heat that builds up through normal space station operation. The EVA lasted for 6 hours and 34 minutes. On June 2, 2017, MS-03 undocked from the ISS, carrying Pesquet and Novitskiy back to Earth, concluding a 196-day mission in space. Peggy Whitson remained on the ISS and returned on Soyuz MS-04. MS-03 touched down just over 3 hours after undocking, concluding Pesquet's first spaceflight. Pesquet has spent 196 days, 17 hours and 49 minutes in space. =Expedition 64/65= On 11 March 2020 ESA announced in a blog post that Pesquet would return to the ISS in the second half of 2021 for a second six-month stay, in which he would become the first European astronaut to launch on board an American Commercial Crew Vehicle. He was scheduled to travel to the Johnson Space Center in Texas to begin training for his flight by the end of March 2020, although in mid-March 2020 he stated on his Instagram story that due to the COVID-19 pandemic he would delay his trip to Houston. He arrived in Houston, alongside German ESA astronaut Matthias Maurer and Roscosmos cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov, Sergey Kud- Sverchkov, Oleg Novitsky and Pyotr Dubrov on 12 May 2020. On 29 April 2020, ESA announced a competition to name Thomas's mission, the winner will be announced in summer 2020 and will receive a signed mission patch flown to the ISS by Pesquet. On July 28, 2020, Pesquet was officially assigned to the SpaceX Crew-2 mission, which is scheduled to launch in late February 2021. He will reach the International Space Station alongside NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough, who will command the Crew Dragon, Megan McArthur, who will act as pilot, and JAXA astronaut Akihiko Hoshide. Once onboard the station, they will join ISS Expedition 64. A few hours before the announcement, Pesquet revealed his second mission name as Alpha, after Alpha Centauri, the nearest star system to the Sun, following the French mission naming tradition.

He was Speaker of the English House of Commons in 1626. Early life Finch was born on 15 December 1580 at The Moat, his father's house near Canterbury. He was the fifth of seven sons of Sir Moyle Finch, 1st Baronet (‚Äì1614) and the former Elizabeth Heneage (1556‚Äì1634).George E. Cokayne Complete Baronetage, Vol. 1 (1900) Among his siblings were Theophilus, Thomas and Francis Finch. His sister Anne was a noted writer who married Sir William Twysden and his sister Catherine married Sir John Wentworth, 1st Baronet of Gosfield. He was the second to be named after his maternal grandfather, and godparent, Sir Thomas Heneage, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Vice-Chamberlain of the Household. His paternal grandfather was Sir Thomas Finch, the prominent military commander. After his father's death in 1614, his mother, Lady Finch, was elevated to the peerage in her own right as Viscountess Winchilsea in 1623 and was further honoured when she was made Countess of Winchilsea in 1628. His mother died in 1634 and was succeeded by his elder brother Thomas, who had already succeeded their eldest brother Theophilus in the baronetcy. He matriculated into Trinity College, Cambridge in about 1592, along with his elder brother Thomas, and was awarded B.A. in 1596. Career He was admitted at Inner Temple in 1597 and called to the bar in 1606. In December 1607, Finch was elected a Member of Parliament for Rye in a by-election following the death of sitting Member, Thomas Hamon. His return was secured by his brother- in-law (Sir William Twysden), who used his influence to obtain a letter of recommendation from Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton. Parliament was in recess, however, so Finch was unable to take his seat until February 1610. He was not returned to Parliament and in 1614 was replaced by Edward Hendon. After he left Parliament, Finch entered the service of Prince Charles. Through Charles, Finch was nominated by the duchy of Cornwall for a parliamentary seat at Helston in December 1620. William Noy obtained the seat, however, the duchy found him an alternative place as MP for West Looe. A few weeks after Parliament began in 1621, Finch also succeeded as Recorder of London following the death of Robert Shute. He held this post until his death in 1631. Between 1621 and 1624 Parliaments, Finch's legal career prospered. After serving as summer reader at the Inner Temple in 1622, he was knighted and made a serjeant. He was knighted on 22 June 1623 and became sergeant-at-law. As Recorder of London, he enjoyed an almost automatic right to represent the City and was not dependent upon the duchy of Cornwall for a seat in Parliament. Therefore, he was elected for City of London in 1624, serving until the formal dissolution of Parliament. After Charles I became King, he was re-elected MP for the City of London in 1625 and in 1626 and was chosen to serve as Speaker of the House for his last term in 1626. Personal life Finch was twice married. Finch was first married to Frances Bell (d. 1627) sometime after 1607. Frances was a daughter of Sir Edmond Bell of Beaupre Hall, Norfolk. Together, they were the parents of three sons and one daughter, including: * Heneage Finch, 1st Earl of Nottingham (1620‚Äì1682), who married Elizabeth Harvey, a niece of Dr. William Harvey. * Francis Finch (1623‚Äì1679), who married the widowed Elizabeth Parkhurst, daughter of Sir Robert Parkhurst. * Elizabeth Finch (b. 1625), who married Edward Maddison (1594‚Äì1672), a son of Sir Ralph Maddison. * John Finch (b. 1627) On 16 April 1629, Sir Heneage was married to Elizabeth (n√©e Cradock) Bennett (d. 1661). Elizabeth, a daughter of William Cradock, was the widow of Richard Bennett (d. 1628), a wealthy London merchant. Together, Lady Finch and Sir Heneage were the parents of several children, including: * Frances Finch (b. 1630), who married Sir Clifford Clifton MP. * Anne Finch (1631‚Äì1679), a philosopher in the tradition of the Cambridge Platonists and an influence on Leibniz who married Edward Conway, Viscount Conway (later 1st Earl of Conway). After a lengthy illness, Sir Heneage died on 5 December 1631, at the age of 51, and was buried at Ravenstone, Buckinghamshire. His widow died in 1661.

It was released on June 29, 2009 in the UK and on July 7, 2009 in the US as the second single from the band's 2009 album Merriweather Post Pavilion, by Domino Records. The song was originally known as \\"Bearhug.\\" The single features three new remixes of the song by D√¢m-Funk, Leon Day, and Zomby, and is available as a 12\\" vinyl single and as a digital download. Background The original name of the song was \\"Bearhug\\" and featured different lyrics and higher pitched- vocals. In a 2009 interview with French magazine VoxPop, David Portner said, \\"The melody of this song came suddenly, while we were rehearsing at my house. It‚Äôs so simple and we immediately loved it. I tried to find an additional melody, much more dark and weird, but nobody liked it! In general, I write the most ‚Äòcomplex‚Äô songs in Animal Collective, with structures A / B / C / D / E‚Ä¶ but I wanted to keep the almost naive simplicity of this song.\\" Merriweather Post Pavilion featured more vocals than most of Animal Collective's other albums, and as a result the band had trouble finding ground with their producer and amongst themselves about how the vocals were to be mixed. \\"Summertime Clothes\\" was where most of the band had trouble agreeing with one another about the mix. Brian Weitz stated in an interview with Sound to Sound, \\"Pretty early on in the mixing we realised we were gonna have to find the middle ground, so we would do three mixes, where the vocals would be where we wanted them to be, then one louder where Ben wanted them to be and then one even lower than where we wanted them to be, just in case we changed our mind. It was very, very rare that we went with the loud vocal version. ‚ÄòSummertime Clothes‚Äô is the biggest example of where we disagreed. Even after we finished the record we were still thinking maybe the vocals are too loud on that song. And Ben felt the opposite way.\\" Music video A screenshot from the music video showing one of the clothed figures dancing next to one of the women in giant bubbles. A music video was released for the song on June 12, 2009, Stylecaster: Animal Collective Release Music Video for \\"Summertime Clothes\\" directed by Dan Perez, who also worked on the \\"Who Could Win a Rabbit\\" video and the band's film ODDSAC.Summertime Clothes Video The video shows a group of people in large, glowing bubbles resembling embryonic sacs with giant red legs and buttocks dancing in rhythmic movements and patterns, while figures wearing mismatched colored clothing dance erratically, with flashing colored lights illuminating them. They all dance around a glowing ice sculpture of a young boy and girl, which is slowly melting. Occasionally, a screaming white face is seen flashing among the erratic dancing. The video prominently features the Brooklyn-based FLEX dance crew. Critical reception The single received critical acclaim. Melissa Locker of TIME said, \\"Animal Collective‚Äôs anthem to summer shows the band at it‚Äôs [sic] idiosyncratic best. The sing-along melody is filled with catchy hooks and a driving beat that screams sunny day.\\" Mike Deane of Pop Matters said the song \\"manages to hit a perfect balance of pure pop bliss mixed with wonky and interesting electro instrumentation, and it even maintains a few weirder, more classic Animal Collective bits, like the ending repetition of ‚Äújust you‚Äù and the midway slow down that immediately joins the pulsing syncopation.\\" He also stated that if Animal Collective \\"can make more hits like ‚ÄúSummertime Clothes‚Äù I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever listen to another band. That‚Äôs right: It‚Äôs that good.\\" Sarah Smith of FasterLouder says that Summertime Clothes is \\"one of Animal Collective‚Äôs finest musical moments.\\" Bart Blasengame of Paste said the single is \\"a robo-tripping love song where‚Äîover a bouncing low end and weird harpsichord crescendos‚ÄîTare and Panda Bear‚Äôs harmonies sound absolutely Shins-esque.\\" NME said that the song is a \\"sun-stroked piece of bio-mechanical mongrel pop with a Neu!-ish rhythm and the feel of Grandaddy in its spacey winsomeness: you could analyse it for hours.\\" Will Hermes of Rolling Stone stated \\"Summertime Clothes is a swirling pastoral with dance-music thrust.\\" In popular culture *\\"Summertime Clothes\\" is featured in the soundtrack to the video game Skate 3. *Animal Collective performed the song live prior to its release on the Late Show with David Letterman on May 7, 2009.

BiographyFamily= She was the fourth daughter of Adam Joseph Schott (1794‚Äì1864), the youngest of five children of Bernhard Schott, the founder of German music publisher (B. Schott's S√∂hne). After establishing several international branches for the firm, Adam left to pursue a musical career, performing in New York during 1830/1. He then became bandmaster of the 79th Regiment, serving in Quebec and Toronto, before a period with the 79th in Britain and then Gibraltar. He left the 79th there to become bandmaster of Grenadier Guards 1844‚Äì1856. Adam died in India (Kirkee, 1864), as bandmaster of Royal Artillery there. Helen's eldest sister, Rosa Schott (n√©e Rosa Antoinette Schott; born Toronto 1834, was on the London stage, at the Theatre Royal, Haymarket for much of 1854‚Äì6. She performed there with actor Robert Edwin Villiers (1830‚Äì1904), whom she married in 1856. Villiers then began a long spell in music hall, as a manager/licensee and then owner/developer. Amongst his halls were the Margate Assembly Rooms, the Canterbury Music Hall (see below), the South London and the Pavilion (still standing at Piccadilly Circus). Rosa died in Torquay 1918. She and Villiers were estranged from around 1871 and it appears that a relationship between Villiers and Ernstone may have been a factor. Helen's younger sister, Angie Schott (n√©e Angelika Francesca Schott; born London circa 1846), was also an actress, active in the US in the 1870s. Sometime in the 1870s or 1880s, Angie married Henry S. Truax (died 1917 in Saratoga Springs, New York, with no known living relatives). What became of Angie is unknown. =Career= Ernstone began her professional career in provincial theatres, playing the role of Geraldine in Buckstone's The Green Bushes at The Canterbury Music Hall, Lambeth in 1867. She made her London debut in 1868 at Covent Garden as Katherine in Katherine and Petruchio. In 1869, she played in Charles Smith Cheltnam's (1823‚Äì1912) Edendale at the opening of the Charing Cross Theatre. The Times wrote: \\"Among the novices are Miss Ernstone, from Manchester, a young lady of prepossessing appearance, who plays Ada Vandaleur... with much force\\".The Times, 24 June 1869, p. 6 For the next ten years she appeared on the West End stage in juvenile leads.

Additionally, the agency identifies deficiencies and recommends improvements for accomplishing peacetime and wartime missions. It also evaluates Air Force activities, personnel, and policies, and provides legal and compliance oversight of all Air Force-level Field Operating Agencies and Direct Reporting Units. Organization The AFIA consists of four directorates. Process Integration Directorate conducts assessments focused on improving processes to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of the Air Force. The Inspection and Oversight Directorate schedules, coordinates, and executes Compliance Inspections, Nuclear Surety Inspection Oversight assessments, and conducts Compliance Inspections of all Field Operating Agencies and Direct Reporting Units. The Medical Operations Directorate performs Health Services Inspections of all Air Force active duty, Reserve, and Guard medical units worldwide in partnership with acknowledged expert civilian accrediting agencies. The Mission Support Directorate provides administrative and logistical support for AFIA. History The AFIA traces its history back to 1927 with the establishment of the Inspection Division under the Chief of the Army Air Corps. The division performed technical inspections in support of flight safety objectives. By the end of World War II, this function was aligned under the Office of the Air Inspector. In 1948, after the Air Force became a separate service, the Air Force chief of staff designated the Office of the Inspector General to oversee all inspection and safety functions. In the 1950s, all activities were consolidated at Norton Air Force Base, California, in the 1002d Inspector General Group commanded by the Deputy Inspector General for Inspection and Safety. On 31 December 1971, the Air Force Inspection and Safety Center was activated, replacing the 1002d IG Group. In August 1991, the center was divided into the Air Force Inspection Agency and the Air Force Safety Agency (now the Air Force Safety Center). The Air Force Inspection Agency and the Safety Center moved to Kirtland Air Force Base, New Mexico, in July 1993, due to the closure of Norton Air Force Base.

Special honours In 2007 Parmitano was awarded the Medaglia d'Argento al Valore Aeronautico (Silver Medal of Aeronautic Valor) by the President of the Italian Republic after safely landing his AMX in an emergency due to a bird strike.Conferimento di onorificenza al Valore aeronautico (GU n.67 del 21-3-2007). Retrieved 18 June 2018 . Asteroid 37627 Lucaparmitano is named after him. Career  Parmitano performing his first EVA Parmitano is a Colonel in the Italian Air Force and an Astronaut of the European Space Agency. He has logged more than 2000 hours flying time, is qualified on more than 20 types of military aircraft (both fixed-wing and rotary-wing) and has flown over 40 types of aircraft. Following completion of undergraduate pilot training in 2001, Parmitano flew the AMX aircraft with the 13th Squadron, 32nd Wing in Amendola, Italy, from 2001 to 2007. During that time, he obtained all the qualifications on that aircraft, including Combat Ready, Four Ship Leader, and Mission Commander/Package Leader. Within the 13th Squadron, he served as Chief of Training Section and Commander of the 76th Flight. He was also the 32nd Wing Electronic Warfare Officer (EWO). In 2007, he was selected by the Italian Air Force to become a test pilot and qualified as Experimental Test Pilot at EPNER, the French test pilot school in Istres. In ESA In May 2009, Parmitano was selected as an ESA astronaut as part of the 2009 class. In July 2015, Parmitano became an aquanaut when he served as commander of the NEEMO 20 crew. =Expedition 36/37 = In February 2011, he was assigned as a flight engineer to Expedition 36/37 (a long-duration mission to the International Space Station), which launched aboard Soyuz TMA-09M on 28 May 2013 and arrived at the ISS on 29 May. His mission is called Volare, which means \\"to fly\\" in ItalianESA Soyuz TMA-09M, Volare mission, Multimedia Gallery, 2013. and is reminiscent of a very famous song by the Italian singer Domenico Modugno. In May 2013 Parmitano partnered with his 15-year-old mentee Abigail Harrison to have her serve as his Earth liaison during his mission on Expedition 36 and Expedition 37. Harrison shared Parmitano's experience of living in space on the International Space Station with her online community on social media and her blog, where she is known as \\"Astronaut Abby\\". Parmitano (left), pictured with Expedition 36 crew member Chris Cassidy On 9 July 2013, he became the first Italian to take part in a spacewalk as he and Chris Cassidy conducted an EVA out of the ISS' quest airlock to install power cables, retrieve material research samples (MISSE-8) and accomplish a number of maintenance tasks. During the EVA, Parmitano also got to ride on the ISS' Mobile Servicing System for the installation of a couple of radiator grapple bars previously flown up on SpaceX' CRS-2 mission. The EVA was part of preparations for the new Russian multipurpose module planned to replace the Pirs docking compartment by the end of 2013. In 2013, AOL's BermanBraun listed his space selfie taken during this spacewalk as one of the 50 best space photos of the year. His second EVA on July 16, 2013 was terminated after only 1 hour and 32 minutes, when the helmet of his Extravehicular Mobility Unit suit started filling with water. Water in his helmet posed the danger of drowning and made his return to the airlock even more difficult, as orbital sunset had occurred just before he started to return. Engineers found that contamination had clogged one of the suit's filters, causing water from the suit's cooling system to back up. On 15 January 2016, astronaut Timothy Kopra experienced a water leak in the same spacesuit. Parmitano returned to Earth on 11 November 2013 aboard Soyuz TMA-09M. =Expedition 60/61 = Canadarm2 robotic arm, carries the new thermal pump system for AMS In May 2018 ESA announced that Parmitano would return to the space station on board the Soyuz MS-13 mission, to serve as Flight Engineer on Expedition 60 and Commander on Expedition 61. Parmitano launched on 20 July 2019 and arrived at the International Space Station on the same day. He became the first DJ in space on 13 August 2019, when he played a set of electronic music from the ISS for a music festival audience in Ibiza.https://www.space.com/first-dj-in-space-astronaut-luca-parmitano.html On 15 November he ventured outside the ISS for the first time since his ill-fated spacewalk in 2013, on the first of at least four spacewalks to repair the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer.https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2019/11/nasa-esa- challenging-ams-repair-spacewalks/ Parmitano conducted the spacewalks to repair AMS together with NASA astronaut Andrew Morgan. Both were assisted by NASA astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir who operate the Canadarm2 robotic arm from inside the Station. The spacewalks were described as the \\"most challenging since Hubble repairs\\". It was the first time astronauts cut and reconnect cooling lines in orbit. The repair of AMS was completed after four spacewalks. In the last spacewalk Parmitano found a leak in one of AMS's cooling lines. The leak was fixed during the spacewalk. Expedition 61 ended with the landing of Soyuz MS-13 on 6 February 2020. Aboard were Parmitano, Aleksandr Skvortsov and Christina Koch.

He was part of the International Space Station Expedition 40 and 41 from May to November 2014. Gerst returned to space on June 6, 2018, as part of Expedition 56/57. He was the Commander of the International Space Station. He returned to Earth on December 20, 2018.http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Human_Spaceflight/Astronauts/An_astronaut_returns_to_Earth Since the end of his second mission, he holds the record for most time in space of any active ESA astronaut (362 days), succeeding Italian astronaut Paolo Nespoli, and German ESA astronaut Thomas Reiter, who formally held the record for the longest time in space for any active or retired ESA astronaut. Education and research Gerst graduated from the Technical High School in √ñhringen, Germany, in 1995. While in high school, he volunteered as a scout leader, firefighter, and water rescue lifeguard. Gerst studied at the University of Karlsruhe (now Karlsruhe Institute of Technology), Germany, where he received a degree in geophysics with distinction. From 1998 to 2003 Gerst participated in several international scientific collaborations and field experiments, including some in remote locations such as Antarctica. From 2001 to 2003, Gerst studied for a master's degree in earth sciences at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand. While researching his master's thesis, he developed volcano monitoring techniques that might improve forecasts of volcanic eruptions. His results were published in Science Magazine. Gerst worked as a researcher at the Institute of Geophysics between 2004 and 2009, and received his doctorate in natural sciences from the University of Hamburg in 2010, with a dissertation on geophysics and volcanic eruption dynamics. In 2007 Gerst received the Bernd Rendel award for outstanding research from the German Research Foundation (DFG).. He has published several papers, including one in Nature. In ESA Gerst was selected as an astronaut in 2009 by the European Space Agency. =Expedition 40/41= He visited space as part of the Expedition 40/41 International Space Station crew from May to November 2014. On 7 October 2014, Gerst performed his first extravehicular activity (EVA) with Reid Wiseman. The astronauts moved a failed cooling pump from temporary to long-term storage on the station's truss. They also installed a new relay system that will provide backup power options to the mobile transporter, which moves the large robotic arm around the out outside of the space station. The duration of the EVA was 6 hours and 13 minutes. Gerst pictured during his first EVA On 10 November 2014, he landed on Earth in the same Soyuz TMA-13M spacecraft that flew him to the International Space Station on 28 May along with Russian commander Maxim Suraev and NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman. Gerst's six-month mission to the ISS was named \\"Blue Dot\\". The mission's name is reminiscent of Carl Sagan's description of Earth as a Pale Blue Dot as seen on a photograph taken by NASA's Voyager mission. The mission experiments included experiments in physical science, biology, human physiology, radiation research, and technology demonstrations. Educational outreach included educational videos as part of the \\"flying classroom\\" and set of experiments performed in microgravity. =Expedition 56/57= Gerst's mission logo.

Rivada Networks was founded on July 6, 2004 and its current CEO and chairman is Irish businessman Declan Ganley. Rivada Networks is financially backed by Peter Thiel. An October 20, 2020 CNN report said that the White House had allegedly increased pressure to fast track a contract to lease the Department of Defense's underutilized spectrum in a public private partnership between the DoD and Rivada Networks, to use DoD's mid-band spectrum to eventually share 5G airwaves with wireless providers. Karl Rove, who is a paid lobbyist for Rivada, and Newt Gingrich have been lobbying since early 2019 for the DoD/Rivada deal which CNN says, would be \\"premium real estate for the booming and lucrative 5G market.\\" Rivada says that is \\"not interested in a nationalized 5G network.\\" Background  The name Rivada is derived from the acronym, \\"Radio Interoperable Voice and Data Applications.\\" Rivada Networks is part of a joint venture with Port Graham Development Corporation called Rivada Port Graham Solutions. In April 2012, Rivada Port Graham Solutions was one of 30 prime contractors awarded a contract on the US Secret Service's $3 billion Tactical Communications (TACCOM) contract for the US Department of Homeland Security. Contractors received contracts in one or multiple technical categories, and each indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract has a 2-year base and three 1-year options. Some of the technical categories on the contract include portable/mobile radios, control/base stations, software, upgrades, repeaters, routers, comparator systems, engineering, design, installations, maintenance, frequency managers, spectrum managers and test equipment. In May 2016 it was disclosed that Rivada Networks had partnered with Harris Corporation, Ericsson, Nokia, Intel Security, Fujitsu Network Communications, and Black & Veatch to form Rivada Mercury. Rivada Mercury unsuccessfully bid to build a nationwide LTE network in the 700 MHz spectrum licensed to FirstNet. Rivada Networks 5G business model In November 2018, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman, Ajit Pai, announced the first spectrum auction for 5G services as part of a multi-year \\"aggressive spectrum strategy\\" to \\"facilitate America's superiority in 5G.\\" 5G‚Äîthe \\"next generation of cellular technology\\"‚Äîwill increase internet speed allowing, for example, users to \\"stream HD videos on your mobile network\\", and doctors to \\"perform remote surgery. In his February 19, 2019 Fox News article, \\"America in race against China‚Äîand the clock‚Äîto control future of tech\\", Newt Gingrich, called for a public-private partnership where private capital would facilitate a \\"wireless moonshot\\" by taking advantage of a \\"shared spectrum available for a carrier-neutral, wholesale-only, nationwide 5G network\\" to \\"show the world that Chinese wireless dominance is not inevitable\\". In early spring 2019, Karl Rove, a Rivada Networks investor, had been actively lobbying Senate Armed Services Committee members and Senator John Cornyn‚Äîco-author of the Secure 5G and Beyond Act, to promote Rivada Networks' 5G business model which involved leasing the Pentagon's mid-band spectrum, according to a May 2019, The New Yorker by Sue Halpern. Halpern described how, the Department of Defense's spectrum which spans the United States, is often unused‚Äîit is set aside for \\"classified, unclassified, and emergency communications.\\" and that Brad Parscale and Gingrich were making a similar case about \\"underutilized spectrum\\". In April 2019, Washington, D.C.-based Jonathan Lee, whose work as an attorney involves FCC matters, questioned why \\"lifelong 'free market' defenders\\" like Newt Gingrich and Karl Rove were embracing a DoD/Rivada partnership. An October 20, 2020 CNN report said that Mark Meadows‚Äîacting on behalf of President Donald Trump‚Äîhas increased pressure to fast track a non-competitive lucrative contract Rivada to lease 350 megahertz of the Department of Defense's mid-band spectrum, which CNN's says, would be \\"premium real estate for the booming and lucrative 5G market.\\" Rivada has repeatedly said that is \\"not interested in a nationalized 5G network.\\"  See also  * Rivada Port Graham Solutions References Category:Defense companies of the United States ","title":"Rivada Networks"},{"id":"22874971","text":"Rutana is a town in Burundi.

Set in Norway and Iceland during the Viking period, it depicts the stirring but bleak existence of Dark Age Europeans at a time of insecurity and constant threat from raiders. The story follows a young woman called Ran from the time she loses her mother in a wolf attack, and a subsequent attempt to kill her as a human sacrifice, to her escape with a blind harper, Toki, to a new life in Iceland. Even there however the threat of sudden violence hangs over small and isolated farming communities. The book does not dwell on bloodshed but is honest about the hardship, unpredictability and cruelty of the period, showing even sympathetic central characters as not immune to painful death. Moral choices are also at times difficult. The book was noted as one of the ten best \\"romance\\" novels for young adults in 2000.

A unit of real estate or immovable property is limited by a legal boundary (sometimes also referred to as a property line or a lot line). The boundary (in Latin: limes) may appear as a discontinuation in the terrain: a ditch, a bank, a hedge, a wall, or similar, but essentially, a legal boundary is a conceptual entity, a social construct, adjunct to the likewise abstract entity of property rights. A cadastral map displays how boundaries subdivide land into units of ownership. However, the relations between society, owner, and land in any culture or jurisdiction is conceived of in terms more complex than a tessellation. Therefore, the society concerned has to specify the rules and means by which the boundary concept is materialized and located on the ground.Turk, Andrew (2007) Representations of Tribal Boundaries of Australian Indigenous Peoples and the Implications for Geographic Information Systems. pp 232 - 244 in Dyson, et al, 2007. A 'Western' version of the operationalization might be a legally specified procedure, performed by a chartered surveyor, supported by statements from neighbors and pertinent documents, and resulting in official recording in the cadastre as well as boundary markings in the field. Alternatively, indigenous people represent boundaries through ephemeral performances, such as song and dance, and, when in more permanent form, e.g. paintings or carvings, in artistic or metaphorical manner.Muecke, S., Benterrak, K., & Roe P.

It declares that the public may utilize the space inside the private property by a revocable license, to prevent it to become a prescriptive easement. Legal boundaries are usually established by a professional surveyor using a transit and or modern Global Positioning System (GPS) technology. The coordinates of the property line are often described on a drawing called a \\"plot plan\\" or \\"plat\\" by indicating the length of the boundary along a specific compass bearing in relation to a verifiable \\"point of beginning\\".

From 1861 till his sudden death in 1870 he was professor in the Jewish high school at Frankfurt.

He further maintained that the origin of the Indo-Germanic language is to be sought not in Asia but in central (Germany). He was a convinced opponent of rationalism in religion. Bibliography Lazarus Geiger's chief work was Ursprung und Entwickelung der menschlichen Sprache und Vernunft (vol. i., Stuttgart, 1868), the principal results of which appeared in a more popular form as Der Ursprung der Sprache (Stuttgart, 1869 and 1878). The second volume of the former was published in an incomplete form (1872, 2nd ed. 1899) after his death by his brother Alfred Geiger.

This empire was ruled by kings and emerged in the mid-7th century and probably ended with the Battle of the Boarn in 734 when the Frisians were defeated by the Frankish Empire. It lay mainly in what is now the Netherlands and ‚Äì according to some 19th century authors ‚Äì extended from the Zwin near Bruges in Belgium to the Weser in Germany. The center of power was the city of Utrecht. In medieval writings, the region is designated by the Latin term Frisia. There is a dispute among historians about the extent of this realm; There is no documentary evidence for the existence of a permanent central authority. Possibly Frisia consisted of multiple petty kingdoms, which transformed in time of war to a unit to resist invading powers, and then headed by an elected leader, the primus inter pares. It is possible that Redbad established an administrative unit. Among the Frisians at that time there was no feudal system.  Pre-Migration Period  The ancient Frisii were living in the low- lying region between the Zuiderzee and the River Ems. In the Germanic pre- Migration Period (i.e., before c. AD 300) the Frisii and the related Chauci, Saxons, and Angles inhabited the Continental European coast from the Zuyder Zee to south Jutland., Dark Age Naval Power. Haywood uses the term 'North German' to distinguish them from the 'Rhine Germans' (the Caninnefates, Batavians, and \\"Frankish\\" tribes). All of these peoples shared a common material culture, and so cannot be defined archaeologically., Dark Age Naval Power. Haywood cites Todd's The Northern Barbarians 100 BC-AD 300 (1987) for this conclusion. What little is known of these early Frisii and their kings is provided by a few Roman accounts about two Frisian kings visiting Rome in the 1st century: Malorix and Verritus. It has been postulated that by AD 400 the Frisii abandoned the land and disappeared from archeological records. However, recent excavations in the dunes of Kennemerland show clear evidence of a continuous habituation. Migration Period  Frisia suffered marine transgressions that made the land largely uninhabitable during the 3rd to 5th centuries. Whatever population may have remained dropped dramatically. In the 6th century, Frisia received an influx of new settlers, mostly Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, who would come to be known as \\"Frisians\\" even though they were not necessarily descended from the ancient Frisii. A legendary king of the Migration Period is Finn, associated with the Battle of Finnsburg. In the story, the young Danish prince Hn√¶f, was staying as an invited guest of the Frisian king Finn. For reasons unknown, a battle broke out between the two parties, probably started by the Frisian side,, \\"in the most generally accepted reconstruction the first assault is from the part of the Frisians in a treacherous onslaught which excites the Danish strenuous defence\\". The term Frisian side avoids imputing specific responsibility to either Finn, Frisians, Jutes, or others. and Hn√¶f was killed. Hn√¶f's retainer Hengest took command, and the sides engaged in a peace treaty; but Hengest and the Danes later avenged Hn√¶f's death and slaughtered the Frisians. An early historical king is Audulf, who minted coins dated to the first third of the 7th century.K.P.H. Faber, Audulfus, een Friese Koning, in Frysl√¢n, Nieuwsblad voor geschiedenis en cultuur, no.4, 4e jaargang, December 1998. The Frisians consisted of tribes with loose bonds, centered on war bands but without great power. In the second half of the 7th century the Frisian kingship reached its maximum geographic development with its center of power in Dorestad. Social classes The earliest Frisian records name four social classes, the (nobiles in Latin documents) and , who together made up the \\"Free Frisians\\" who might bring suit at court, and the laten or liten with the slaves, who were absorbed into the laten during the Early Middle Ages, as slavery was not so much formally abolished, as evaporated. The laten were tenants of lands they did not own and might be tied to it in the manner of serfs, but in later times might buy their freedom. History of wars The exact title of the Frisian rulers depends on the source. Frankish sources tend to call them dukes; other sources often call them kings. Only three Frisian rulers are named in contemporary written sources. =Aldgisl= Under the rule of the king Aldgisl, the Frisians came in conflict with the Frankish mayor of the palace Ebroin, over the old Roman border fortifications. Aldgisl could keep the Franks at a distance with his army. In 678 he welcomed the English bishop Wilfrid, who, like him, was not a friend of the Franks. While Wilfrid was at Aldegisel's court, Ebroin, offered Aldegisel a bushel of gold coins in return for Wilfrid, alive or dead. Aldegisel himself is said to have torn up and burned the letter from the Frankish mayor in front of the ambassadors and his household. It has been surmised by some that Aldegisel's kindness to Wilfrid was a mode of defiance of Frankish domination. During his stay, Wilfrid attempted to convert the Frisians, who were still pagan at that time. Wilfrid's biographer says that most of the nobles converted,Levison England and the Continent pp. 50‚Äì51 but the success was short-lived. = Radbod = Frisian sceattas c.710‚Äì735 Great fibula of Wijnaldum from the 7th century, found in 1953 In 680, Aldgisl died and was succeeded by his son Radbod, king of the Frisians. While Aldgisl, had welcomed Christianity into his realm, Radbod attempted to extirpate the religion and free the Frisians from subjugation to the Merovingian kingdom of the Franks. In 689, however, Radbod was defeated by Pepin of Herstal in the battle of Dorestad and compelled to cede Frisia Citerior (Nearer Frisia, from the Scheldt to the Vlie) to the Franks. The battle of Dorestad took place around 690 by the capital city of the Frisians close to the Rhine. The Franks were victorious in the battle under the Austrasian mayor of the palace, Pepin of Herstal. Dorestad and Utrecht fell into the hands of Pepin, this gave the Franks control of important trade routes on the Rhine to the North Sea. Following this defeat, Radbod retreated to the island of Heligoland. Willibrord, a student of Wilfred's, was sent to Christianise the pagan Frisians at the request of Pepin, who had nominal suzerainty over the region. On 21 November 695 Pope Sergius I gave him a pallium and consecrated him as bishop of the Frisians.Mershman, Francis. \\"St. Willibrord.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 5 Mar. 2014 He returned to Frisia to preach and establish churches, among them a monastery at Utrecht, where he built his cathedral. Willibrord is counted the first Bishop of Utrecht. It is presumed that the influence of the Franks now reached from south of the Oude Rijn to the coast, but this is not entirely clear because the influence of the Frisians over the central river area was not entirely lost. In any case there was a Catholic Church mission to pagan Frisia with a monastery and episcopal see in Utrecht from 695, founded for Willibrord,it Liber Pontificalis (Corpus XXXVI 1, side 168) en Beda Venerabilis (Corpus XLVI9, page 218) and a marriage was arranged between Grimoald the Younger the oldest son of Pepin, and Thiadsvind, the daughter of Redbad, in 711. After Pepin died, in 714, Radbod took advantage of the battle for succession in Francia and regained southern Frisia. He made a treaty with the Neustrasian mayor of the palace, Ragenfrid. In 716, the king of the Franks, Chilperic II, and Ragenfrid, the mayor of the palace of Neustria, invaded Austrasia to impose their will on the competing factions there: those of Theudoald and Plectrude, Pepin's heir and widow respectively, and those of Martel himself, newly escaped from Plectrude's Cologne prison and acclaimed mayor of the palace of Austrasia. Simultaneously Radbod, King of Frisia invaded Austrasia, forcing Saint Willibrord and his monks to flee, and allied with the king and the Neustrians. Outside of Cologne, held by Plectrude, an ill-prepared Charles Martel was defeated by Radbod, and forced to flee to the mountains of the Eifel. Cologne fell after a short siege to Chilperic, the Frisians and the Neustrians.Kurth, Godefroid. \\"Charles Martel.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 20 Jul. 2014 Once in the mountains of the Eifel, Charles began to rally his supporters, and in short order was ready to do battle. Many Austrasians, under attack by Neustrians, Frisians, and Saxons in the northeast likely rallied behind Martel because he was the only surviving adult male of the Pippinnid family.Costambeys, Marios, Innes, Matthew, and MacLean, Simon. The Carolingian World, Cambridge University Press, 2011 His forces then attacked the army of Chilperic II and his allies at the Battle of Ambl√®ve near Amel as they returned triumphantly from Cologne.. Martel used a feigned retreat, falling on his foes as they rested at midday, and feigning falling back to draw them fully out of a defensive position, where he defeated them, devastating the Frisian army. Willibrord was then joined by Boniface, an Anglo-Saxon bishop. They spent a year together attempting to convert the Frisians to christianity, but their efforts were frustrated when Radbod retook possession of Frisia, burning churches and killing many missionaries.RKK.nl retrieved 23 June 2014 Willibrord and Boniface were forced to flee to the protection of Charles Martel. The Frisian army returned to the north with a large war loot. Radbod made plans to invade Francia for the second time and mobilised a large army, but before he could do this he died of an illness in 719. It is not certain who the successor of Redbad was. It is believed that there were troubles with the succession, because the Frankish opponent Charles Martel could easily invade Frisia and subjugate the land. The resistance was so weak that Charles Martel not only annexed Frisia Citerior (\\"nearer\\" Frisia south of the Rhine), but he also crossed the Rhine and annexed \\"farther\\" Frisia, to the banks of the river Vlie. Now protected by the Franks, Willibrord returned to Frisia. = Poppo = There was a rebellion against Frankish rule in the region of Westergo in 733, which Charles put down. The inhabitants gave hostages, converted to Christianity and recognised Frankish overlordship, but after Charles left they were punished by their fellow Frisians. The next year, the Frisians rebelled again, this time under Bubo's leadership. Charles gathered a large fleet and army and prepared a naval invasion. Initial landings on Westergo and OostergoThese regions were described as islands (insulae) in contemporary accounts. encountered no resistance, since Charles's aim was to bring Bubo to heel. This time no punitive measures were taken against the Frisians. Charles and Bubo's armies met on the banks of the river Boorne, perhaps at Oldeboorne, one of the Frisians' chief commercial centers at the time. The Franks appear to have coveted the trade that passed through there and through Domburg and Dorestad. The Frisians commanded by King Bubo used boats to land their army and surprise the Franks. However the Franks had constructed a fortified encampment once on shore and the Frisian army was defeated. Bubo was killed in combat and his army was pushed back to Eastergoa. The death of Bubo marked an important phase in the destruction of Frisian paganism. Charles ordered pagan shrines and sanctuaries to be destroyed and carried back to Francia \\"a great mass of spoils\\" (magna spolia et praeda). The Frisian army was pushed back to Eastergoa. The next year the Battle of the Boarn took place. Charles ferried an army across the Almere with a fleet that enabled him to sail up to De Boarn. The Frisians were defeated in the ensuing battle, and their king Poppo was killed. The victors began plundering and burning heathen sanctuaries. Charles Martel returned with much loot, and broke the power of the Frisian kings for good. The Franks annexed the Frisian lands between the Vlie and the Lauwers. In 752/753 Boniface wrote a letter to Pope Stephen II, in which it is said that Willibrord destroyed the Frisian pagan sanctuaries and temples. C.J.C. Broer and M.W.J. de Bruijn, Bonifatius en de Utrechtse kerk, in: C. Dekker and E.S.C. Erkelens-Buttinger (1997), De kerk en de Nederlanden, page 63, Verloren, In the Life written by Alcuin are two texts about Willibrord and pagan places of worship. In one he arrived with his companions in Walcheren in the Netherlands where he smashed a sculpture of the ancient religion. Alcuin, Vita Sancti Willibrordi, circa 795, chapter 14 (English translation) In the second text passage Willibord arrived on an island called Fositesland (possibly Heligoland) where a pagan god named Fosite was worshipped. Here he despoiled this god of its sanctity by using the god's sacred well for baptisms and the sacred cattle for food.Alcuin, chapter 10M. Mostert (1999), 754, Bonifatius Bij Dokkum Vermoord , Uitgeverij Verloren, page 23, Emboldened by the success of the Frankish subjugation of Frisia, Boniface returned in 754 to once again attempt to convert the Frisians. He baptized a great number and summoned a general meeting for confirmation at a place not far from Dokkum, between Franeker and Groningen. Instead of the converts he expected, a group of armed inhabitants appeared. The Frisian warriors were angry because he had destroyed their shrines and slew the archbishop, looting his chests and destroying his books. The Frisians consisted of loosely bonded tribes centered on war bands but without great power. In the second half of the 7th century the Frisian kingdom reached its maximum geographic development. After the Frankish conquest The Danish king Gudfred who in 810 let his fleet invade Frisia. 17th century engraving. In 772, the Frankish king Charlemagne attacked the Frisians east of the Lauwers with a large army. He defeated them in several battles and so brought an end to the Frisian independence, expanding the Frankish Empire further to the east, where the Saxon Wars would begin. The Saxon leader Widukind organized resistance to the Franks, in 782 the Frisians east of the Lauwers also joined the uprising. The uprising expanded to Frisian lands in the west that had been pacified earlier. This led to an en masse return to paganism by the population, marauders burned churches and the priests had to flee south. The Carolingians conquered the area east of the Lauwers in 785, when Charlemagne defeated Widukind. They laid Frisia under the rule of grewan, a title that has been loosely related to count in its early sense of \\"governor\\" rather than \\"feudal overlord\\". Charlemagne eventually crushed this revolt, but faced another uprising by the Frisians in 793 - driven by the conscription of Frisians into the Frankish army. Under the leadership of dukes Unno and Eilrad, the uprising arose east of the Lauwers and spread to other Frisian lands. This again led to a temporary return to paganism, and again priests had to flee. This uprising was also suppressed by the Franks. During this time Charlemagne imposed the Lex Frisionum, a penal code which stratified Frisia into Nobility, Freemen, Serfs and Slaves. In 810 the Danish king Gudfred let a fleet consisting of 200 ships invade Frisia, and claiming the territory as a part of his Danish kingdom. The Danish king though was shortly after the invasion killed by one of his own men, and his fleet withdrew to Denmark before it came to any clash with regular Frankish forces. Before 1101, sources talk about counts ruling over Frisia, west of the Vlie as Frisian counts. But in this year count Floris II is mentioned as Florentius comes de Hollant (Floris, Count of Holland). Holland is probably from the Old Dutch , literally \\"wood land\\", describing the district around Dordrecht, the nucleus of the County of Holland.http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Holland The counts generally kept to this single title until 1291, when Floris V, Count of Holland decided to call himself Count of Holland and Zeeland, lord of Friesland. This title was also used after Holland was united with Hainault, Bavaria-Straubing, and the Duchy of Burgundy. The titles eventually lost their importance, and the last count, Philip II of Spain, only mentioned them halfway through his long list of titles.

Idaho State Capitol, Boise Carnegie Library, Boise (defunct) St. John's Cathedral, Boise University of Idaho Administration Building, Moscow He was associated with partnerships John E. Tourtellotte & Company and Tourtellotte & Hummel, based in Boise. Works by these firms were covered in a 1982 study and many of the buildings were immediately or later listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Early years Tourtellotte was born in East Thompson, Connecticut, to a well-respected French Huguenot family. His father, Charles W. Tourtellotte, was a prosperous farmer and grist-mill owner. At age 17, he enrolled as an apprentice to the architectural firm of Cutting & Bishop, based in Webster, Massachusetts, where he studied architectural drawing for two years. During this time, he supervised roof construction for the Butler Insane Asylum in Providence, Rhode Island, and the Anne & Hope factory in Lonsdale, which was then the largest factory in the United States. Following his apprenticeship, Tourtellotte traveled westward, working on construction projects in Chicago, Kansas City, Albuquerque, and Pueblo, Colorado, before arriving in Boise in 1890, months after Idaho achieved statehood. Idaho and Oregon His architectural and construction business thrived in Boise, and by 1894, Tourtellotte devoted his business entirely to architecture. In 1903, he formed a partnership with German immigrant Charles Hummel (1857‚Äì1939), a university- trained architect who had previously worked for Tourtellotte's architecture and construction business.History of Idaho. French, Hiriam T. The Lewis Publishing Company, 1914. Though the firm's headquarters were moved to Portland in 1913, the Boise office was retained. The partnership was dissolved in 1922, and Tourtellotte then partnered with one of Charles Hummel's sons, fellow architect Frank K. Hummel (1892‚Äì1961). The two shared a Portland office from 1922 until Tourtellotte's retirement in 1930, and Frank Hummel worked there until its closure around 1934, when he returned to Boise. *Tourtellote continued to work as he designed a proposed Portland City Hall in 1933 with architect Truman E. Phillips as well as a completed project, Linn County Courthouse in Albany, OR, which was in the building stages at the time of his death, also with Mr. PHillips, according to \\"Architect and Engineer\\", Vols. 136-139, page 55.

He and his wife Della (1869‚Äì1946) are buried in Idaho at Morris Hill Cemetery in Boise. Tourtellotte was known for combining architectural motifs from disparate styles and eras, and the domed Idaho State Capitol is celebrated for its use of natural light. To celebrate the opening of the state capitol, Tourtellotte wrote an essay where he compared the architectural styles of various eras to the state of spiritual and moral development of civilization evident during those times, with the use of illumination and light signifying the increasing spiritual enlightenment of humanity.

The state capitol underwent an extensive restoration which was completed in 2010.http://idahoptv.org/productions/specials/capitoloflight/ Tourtellotte also designed the replacement Administration Building at the University of Idaho in Moscow. Construction of the Tudor Gothic-style structure began in 1907 and the main building was completed in 1909; its wings in 1912 and 1916. Based on the Hampton Court Palace in England, the UI Administration Building is a campus icon and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, at age 69.University of Idaho - special collections - UI buildings - A - accessed 2010-03-23 Tourtellotte fraternal affiliations were with the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, the Freemasons, and the Kiwanis.

She served during the American War of Independence, and during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. During the war with America, Centurion saw action in a number of engagements and supported British forces in the Caribbean and the North American coasts. Spending the period of peace either serving as a flagship in the Caribbean or laid up or under refit in British dockyards, she was recommissioned in time to see action in the wars with France, particularly in the East Indies. Her most important action came in the Battle of Vizagapatam in 1804, in which she fought against the French squadron of Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois that consisted of a 74-gun ship, and two frigates. Despite sustaining severe damage, she continued fighting, and survived the assault by the considerably heavier forces. Returning to Britain shortly afterwards, she was refitted and transferred to Halifax, where she served as a hospital and receiving ship for the rest of her career. She sank at her moorings there in 1824, and was raised the following year and broken up, ending 50 years of Royal Navy service. Construction Centurion was ordered on 25 December 1770 and laid down in May 1771 at the yards of Barnard & Turner, of Harwich. She was launched on 22 May 1774 and had been completed by 9 September 1775. She cost a total of ¬£20,537.17.9d, including masts and rigging, with a further ¬£4,205.16.10d spent on fitting her out for sea. Centurion was commissioned in July 1775 under her first commander, Captain Richard Braithwaite. American War of Independence Under Braithwaite, Centurion sailed to North America in late 1775, and was present at the occupation of Rhode Island in December of the following year. Centurion was part of Richard Howe's fleet at its encounter with the comte d'Estaing on 11 August 1778, after which she briefly became Howe's flagship between 14 and 15 August. By November, she was in the West Indies with William Hotham's forces, where she supported the landings on St. Lucia on 14 and 15 December. Remaining in the Leeward Islands throughout 1779, Centurion took part in the Battle of Martinique on 17 April 1780, followed by periods of action in the indecisive clashes that took place on 15 and 19 May. Centurion, then returned to Britain and was paid off in September 1780. After a period spent being repaired and refitted at Portsmouth, she returned to North America in July 1781 under the command of Captain Samuel Clayton. On 22 January 1783, she came upon a battle between the frigate and the 36-gun French frigate Sibylle off the Chesapeake, prompting Sybille surrender. At the end of the American War of Independence Centurion returned home, where she was paid off in October 1783 and fitted to be laid up in ordinary at Sheerness. Inter-war period After a year spent laid up, Centurion began a Great Repair at Woolwich in December 1784, which was completed in December 1787. She returned to active service in February 1789, as the flagship of Rear-Admiral Philip Affleck, with William Otway as her captain. Otway sailed her to Jamaica in May 1789, returning to Britain in August 1792, where she underwent another repair and refit, this time at Chatham. She was recommissioned during this work, in November 1792, under Captain Samuel Osborn. With the dockyard completed by January 1793 she sailed to the Leeward Islands in February. French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars After some time spent on the Leeward islands, Centurion sailed to the East Indies in November 1793 and was present at the Action of 5 May 1794. On 22 October the following year, she and fought an action with the 44-gun French frigates Prudente and Cyb√®le, plus the 22-gun Jean-Bart and 14-gun Coureur off Mauritius. She went on to take part in the capture of Ceylon in July and August 1795, and of Amboyna and Baada in February 1796. Captain John Sprat Rainier took command in April 1797, remaining initially in the East Indies, but shifting to the Red Sea in 1799 and 1800. The British had received information that the French had transferred warship frames to Suez to build some warships for the Red Sea. Centurion sailed to Mocha, where she met up with and sailed with her to Suez. During 1799 William Hugh Dobbie, first lieutenant of Centurion, surveyed the Jeddah and Crossire (also spelled \\"Cossir\\" and \\"Kossir\\") roads, the harbour at the Jaffatine islands, and several other anchorages. His efforts would prove of use to a later British expedition under Sir David Baird and Rear-Admiral Blanket. Centurion returned to Batavia in August 1800. She came under the command of Captain James Lind, in an acting capacity, in 1804. On 23 August 1800, Centurion, with Sybille, Daedalus, and Braave captured or destroyed several Dutch vessels at Batavia Roads. One vessel, a Dutch brig, the Royal Navy took into service as Admiral Rainier. =Battle of Vizagapatam= By September 1804, Admiral Peter Rainier, the commander of the fleet Centurion was attached to, had become concerned about the presence of a French squadron in the area under Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois which was raiding British shipping. He therefore substituted the small frigate HMS Wilhelmina with the Centurion as a convoy escort for a small convoy of two East Indiamen, the Barnaby and the Princess Charlotte. The convoy was anchored at Vizagapatam early on 15 September when Linois's squadron approached the harbour. The Centurions commander, James Lind was ashore, leaving Lieutenant James Robert Phillips in command. Phillips sighted the approaching ships and, suspecting them to be French, opened fire. Linois continued to approach, causing one of the East Indiamen to run ashore, where she was wrecked, while Lind hurried to return to his ship. The three main French ships, the 74-gun Marengo and the frigates S√©millante and Atalante, continued to approach under fire from Centurion and the shore batteries protecting the harbour. When the French frigates came within , Phillips opened fire on Atalante as S√©millante attempted to reach the other side of the British ship and surround her. Linois did not want to risk the Marengo when there might be uncharted shoals about, and so he fired from a longer range. After several hours of fighting Centurion had suffered severe damage. She had been severely holed, with her rigging wrecked and her anchor cable shot through, which caused her to slowly drift away from the shore, out of control. The French took the opportunity to capture the remaining East Indiaman and withdraw from the harbour. The Centurion lost one man killed and nine wounded. The French suffered slightly heavier losses, Marengo losing two men killed and an officer wounded and Atalante three killed and five wounded. S√©millante, which had not been closely engaged in the battle, suffered no casualties. Damage to the French ships was severe, and Linois was forced to abandon further operations. Both nations claimed the encounter as a victory, the French for the capture of the East Indiaman and the British for the survival of Centurion in the face of overwhelming French numerical superiority. Retirement from active service Centurion did not remain much longer in the East Indies, being sent home in November as needing an extensive repairs, due at least in part to the damage inflicted by an infestation of white ants. The letter sent back with her from the commanding officer of her station declared that he was sending her home as she \\"will require an expensive repair if detained any longer in this Country; in her present state she may be converted by the Navy Board to some useful inferior establishment, as I know of no other mean of effectively getting rid of the White Ants onboard her, who have at times discovered themselves by serious depredations aloft\\". Centurion was duly fitted at Chatham for service as a hospital ship, and sailed to Halifax in 1808 under the command of Lieutenant Edward Webb. She became a receiving ship and stores depot there under Captain George Monke, followed by a return to being a hospital ship in 1809.

The Manchester Guardian ended its report on the performance: \\"In our unwilling acceptance of her farewell, we must now rest satisfied with the memory of the peerless beauty of her merry-hearted acting... like the music of a bewitching melody piercing the stillness of the night, and ending just when the ear longed for the next note.\\"\\"Miss Kate Terry's Farewell Benefit\\",The Manchester Guardian, 5 October 1867, p. 7 =Later years= After her farewell performances, she left the stage to marry the wealthy haberdasher and silk merchant Arthur James Lewis (of the firm Lewis & Allenby).Auerbach, p. 70Morley, p. 25 The couple had four daughters, the eldest of whom was also named Kate (the mother of Gielgud). The youngest, Mabel Terry-Lewis, became an actress.\\"Lewis, Mabel Terry\\", Who's Who (1907), Vol. 59, pp. 1055‚Äì56 Terry made two later appearances on stage: first in 1898, in Stuart Ogilvie's The Master, with John Hare and her daughter Mabel, and in June 1906 she played Ursula in a scene from Much Ado About Nothing at the gala stage celebration of her sister Ellen's jubilee. Terry and her husband lived in considerable style in Moray Lodge in Kensington, London, where he hosted the Moray Minstrels, until Lewis lost all his money. After that, in Gielgud's words, \\"my grandmother lived very simply and rather resentfully in an ugly little house in West Cromwell Road, and she had no grand clothes and did not give parties any more. She played bridge and had paying guests. This was a sad ending to her career but she never grumbled or groused. She must have hated being out of the picture, even though many people still recognized her and paid court to her.\\" Terry died in London, aged 79.

Bundala harbors 197 species of birds, the highlight being the greater flamingo, which migrate in large flocks. Bundala was designated a wildlife sanctuary in 1969 and redesignated to a national park on 4 January 1993. In 1991 Bundala became the first wetland to be declared as a Ramsar site in Sri Lanka. In 2005 the national park was designated as a biosphere reserve by UNESCO, the fourth biosphere reserve in Sri Lanka. The national park is situated southeast of Colombo. History The area was declared a wildlife sanctuary on 5 December 1969, and was upgraded to a national park on 4 January 1993 with land area of . However the park was regazetted in 2004 and the original park was reduced to . In 1991, Bundala became the first site in Sri Lanka to be designated a Ramsar wetland. In 2005, Bundala was declared a Man and Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO. In January 2006, an area adjacent to Bundala covering an area of was declared as the Wilmanna Sanctuary. Physical features The area mainly underlain with hornblende- biotite gneiss of the eastern Vijayan series. The low country dry zone climate prevails in the area. The area has an average relative humidity of 80%. The national park contains five shallow, brackish lagoons with salt pans in three. They are Bundala lagoon of , Embilikala Lagoon of , Malala Lagoon of , Koholankala lagoon of , and Mahalewaya of . The Koholankala and Mahalewaya are almost totally developed for salt production. The climatic conditions are tropical monsoonal, with a mean annual temperature of . Annual rainfall ranges from , with dry period persists from May to September.The elevation of the park ranges from sea level to . The park was affected by 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Due to protection from sand dunes the park received very little damage. Flora The ecological areas of the national park contain seven terrestrial habitat types and six wetland types. The dry thorny shrubs and herbs being the most abundant plant life. A total of 383 plant species belonging to 90 families have been recorded from the park. \\"The Phytoplankton in all the lagoons is dominated by blue-green algae\\" including species such as Macrocystis, Nostoc, Oscillatoria. Hydrilla is in abundance in Malala- Ambilikala Lagoons. Water hyacinth, water lilies, and Typha angustifolia reed beds are found in the marshes and streams. The vegetation mainly consists of Acacia scrubs including Dichrostachys cinerea, Randia dumetorum, Ziziphus sp., Gymnosporia emarginata, Carissa spinarum, Capparis zeylanica and Cassia spp. The trees of the forest are Bauhinia racemosa, Salvadora persica, Drypetes sepiaria, Manilkara hexandra (Palu in Sinhalese), and less common Chloroxylon swietenia, Azadirachta indica, and Feronia limonia. Halophyte plants thrive in the national park's environmental conditions. Salicornia brachiata and Halosarcia indica are examples of salt-tolerant plants. In the small degraded patch of mangrove found at the Bundala lagoon area, Lumnitzera racemosa trees are widespread. The strip of Palu tree Manilkara hexandra forest on the sand- dunes east of Bundala village is a unique type of forest in Sri Lanka. Fauna The greater flamingo is the highlight of migrants The Bundala National Park has been identified as an outstanding Important Bird Area in the South Indian and Sri Lankan wetlands. 324 species of vertebrates have been recorded in the national park, which include 32 species of fish, 15 species of amphibians, 48 species of reptiles, 197 species of birds and 32 species of mammals. 52 species of butterflies are among the invertebrates. The wetland habitats in Bundala harbours about 100 species of water birds, half of them being migrant birds. Of 197 avifaunal species 58 are migratory species. National Bird Ringing Programme (NBRP) was launched in Bundala by in collaboration of Department of Wildlife Conservation and Field Ornithology Group of Sri Lanka in 2005. The greater flamingo Phoenicopterus roseus which visits in large flocks of over 1,000 individuals, from Rann of Kutch of India is being the highlight. Waterfowl (lesser whistling duck Dendrocygna javanica, garganey Anas querquedula), cormorants (little cormorant Phalacrocorax niger, Indian cormorant P. fuscicollis), large water birds (grey heron Ardea cinerea, black-headed ibis Threskiornis melanocephalus, Eurasian spoonbill Platalea leucorodia, Asian openbill Anastomus oscitans, painted stork Mycteria leucocephala), medium-sized waders (Tringa spp.), and small waders (Charadrius spp.) are the other avifaunal species which are present in large flocks. Black-necked stork Ephippiorhynchus asiaticus, lesser adjutant Leptoptilos javanicus and Eurasian coot Fulica atra are rare birds inhabit in the national park. A few Asian elephants (Elephas maximus) still inhabit the forests of Bundala. Other mammals seen in the park are toque macaque Macaca sinica, common langur Presbytis entellus, jackal Canis aureus, leopard Panthera pardus, fishing cat Felis viverrinus, rusty-spotted cat Felis rubiginosa, mongoose Herpestes spp., wild boar Sus scrofa, mouse deer Tragulus meminna, Indian muntjac Muntiacus muntjak, spotted deer Cervus axis, sambar C. Unicolor, black-naped hare Lepus nigricollis, Indian pangolin Manis crassicaudata, and porcupine Hystrix indica. Bundala harbors various forms of fishes including salt water dispersants Anguilla bicolor, marine forms Ambassis gymnocephalus, brackish water forms Chanos chanos and freshwater forms Channa striata. Bundala's herpetofauna includes two endemic species, a toad and a snake, Bufo atukoralei and Xenochrophis asperrimus. Among reptiles are mugger crocodile Crocodylus palustris, estuarine crocodile Crocodylus porosus, common monitor Varanus bengalensis, star tortoise Geochelone elegans, python Python molurus, rat snake Pytas mucosus, endemic flying snake Chrysopelea taprobana, cat snakes Boiga spp. and whip snakes Dryophis spp. The adjacent seashore of Bundala is a breeding ground for all five species of globally endangered sea turtles that migrate to Sri Lanka. Threats and conservation The water quality in the lagoons has changed by the drainage of excess water from irrigation systems,Piyankarage S. C., A. P. Mallawatantri, Y. Matsuno, and K. A. S. Pathiratne. 2004. Human impacts and the status of water quality in the Bundala RAMSAR wetland lagoon system in southern Sri Lanka. Wetlands Ecology and Management 12(5): 473‚Äì482. and release of sludge from the saltern into Bundala lagoon. The habitats of the wading birds and wildlife in the shrub forest and dunes is threatened as a result of the spread of two invasive alien plants Prosopis juliflora and Opuntia dillenii around the tidal plains in Malala-Ambilikala Lagoons and the sand dunes and nearby scrub forests. The spread of Prosopis juliflora is made easy by uncontrolled livestock herds. The seeds of the Opuntia cactuses (called Kathu Potak in Sinhala) are spread by macaque monkeys, and perhaps other animals and birds, that eat the fruits. It is also spread by people cutting down the cactus but leaving the cuttings, which then re-sprout. No biological control measures have been carried out with the moth Cactoblastis cactorum so far. Manual removal of the cactuses will be impossible as the area where they have spread over is vast.Lalith Gunasekera, Invasive Plants: A guide to the identification of the most invasive plants of Sri Lanka, Colombo 2009, pp. 114‚Äì115.

Colombo : IUCN Sri Lanka, 2002. Conservation projects launched include a turtle conservation project, and an invasive alien plants eradication program aimed at the removal of Prosopis juliflora and Opuntia dillenii. The proposed conservation measures are re- demarcation of the park's boundary and widen the boundary to include the northern scrubland, resettle families inhabiting within the park, a programme to control spread of invasive alien plants, create irrigation structures to stop the flow of irrigation water and management of livestock grazing.

John Pollard may have been the Pollard who, without Christian name, is mentioned as entering the Middle Temple on 3 June 1515; but it may also be that this entry is that of his relative Lewis Pollard, son of Sir Hugh Pollard and grandson of Sir Lewis Pollard (c. 1465 ‚Äì 1526), Justice of the Common Pleas. John was appointed Autumn Reader of the Middle Temple in 1535, and became serjeant-at-law in 1547. In 1529 and 1536 he was elected Member of Parliament for Plymouth. After 1545 he received, perhaps through the influence of a relative, Richard Pollard, who had taken part in the suppression of the monasteries, a grant of the manor of Nuneham Courtney, where he subsequently lived. He was relieved by patent of 21 October 1550 from his office of serjeant-at-law, in order to become vice-president of the council for the Welsh marches. He was elected member for Oxfordshire in the parliaments of 1553 and 1554, and for Chippenham, Wiltshire in that of 1555.

Urban Upstart is set in the fictional British town of Scarthorpe, a particularly grim town with high crime and unemployment rates. The protagonist begins in their house at three o'clock in the morning, with the objective of escaping from Scarthorpe. Gameplay Trying to leave the protagonist's house Urban Upstart is a text adventure in which the player types actions in verb-noun format. The upper half of the screen displays an illustration of the current location. Typing in expletives results in the protagonist being arrested on obscenity charges and sent to a gaol. Unlike Richard Shepherd Software's previous adventure, Invincible Island, Urban Upstart did not come supplied with a separate \\"help program\\". This was intended to take the pressure off the company with regards to giving hints, but only caused customer confusion. With Urban Upstart, Shepherd instead supplied help sheets to customers who wrote in asking for information. Reception Urban Upstart received mixed criticism. Computer and Video Games found the scenario to be original, but was frustrated with the implementation. Some obvious nouns were not recognized (for example, \\"SHOP\\" outside a chip shop) and the illustrations took too long to draw, with no option of turning them off. The maze-like hospital and gaol locations were also seen as frustrating. Your Spectrum highlighted the game's graphics and recommended it as a good, entertaining adventure. CRASH magazine awarded 64%, finding the story to be a nice change from the usual fantasy setting, highlighting a large vocabulary and detailed (but slow) graphics. In contrast, Micro Adventurer found the vocabulary to be limited, with some occasionally confusing graphics, but recommended the game to those who can appreciate bleak humour. Sinclair User awarded 8 out of 10, finding the portrayal of Scarthorpe to be inventive and convincing. Despite mixed reviews, Urban Upstart consistently sold well and is considered to be a fondly remembered adventure.

The district contains more than 100 significant buildings, including the Church San Germ√°n de Auxerre and the Convento de Porta Coeli. History Spanish colonists established La Villa de San Germ√°n de Auxerre, also known as Nueva Salamanca, in the early years of the 16th century. The town of San Germ√°n grew out of the settlement formally established in 1573, and it is this original urban core, transformed by rapid growth from the 1830s to the 1940s, that comprises the San Germ√°n Historic District. The district includes numerous homes, among these the noted Victorian-style Juan Ortiz Perichi House on Luna Street, which architect Jorge Rigau once called \\"one of the best developed spatial sequences in residential architecture in Puerto Rico.\\" Many notable Puerto Ricans came from the San Germ√°n Historic District; among them was Lola Rodr√≠guez de Ti√≥, the well-known poet and pro-independence leader who wrote the lyrics to the revolutionary version of Puerto Rico's national anthem \\"La Borinque√±a\\". In late summer 1898, under the command of General Theodore Schwan, the United States Cavalry traveled through Luna Street, during the Spanish-American War, and Puerto Ricans welcomed the Americans in this district and in nearby Mayag√ºez, with flowers- believing in the promise of prosperity that would come under American rule. Despite wanting to spend the night in San Germ√°n, the Americans decided to continue moving on, to battle the Spanish.

The mining town was located on the west side of Bristol Mountain, northwest of Pioche, Nevada. The first mining claims were staked in 1870. The district was organized the next year when the settlement of National City grew around the National Mine. In 1872 a furnace was built to treat silver-lead ore from the Bristol Mine, to the east. In 1878 a richer deposit was found, resulting in the construction of a stamp mill. The settlement was renamed Bristol City the same year. The stamp mill expanded in 1880 and a smelter was built, while stone ovens were built to provide charcoal for the smelter. The town's wells provided water to the mines. By 1890 a new smelter was built to treat copper ore, and the town's population reached 400. Activity declined after 1893. A leach-recovery plant built in 1900 operated for two years, recovering copper. In 1913 an aerial tramway was built to Jackrabbit, Nevada, to the northeast, where ore could be loaded on the Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad. Mining activity continued intermittently, sharply declining after 1918. The town was briefly renamed Tempest after the Tempest Mine in 1922, returning to Bristol in 1929. The post office continued until 1950. The townsite was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972.

It only measures approximately in diameter and was named after the town of Zumba in Ecuador. The name was adopted by IAU's Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature in 2006.  Description  THEMIS day-time image of Zumba Zumba has a depth of about 620 meters, and its rim rises about 200 meters above the surrounding lava-filled plains of Daedalia Planum. Zumba is approximately 25% deeper than the average Martian crater of this size, this fact suggests it is a very fresh crater. Since Zumba is so young, it is a perfect example of a simple crater. On Mars, a simple crater is generally less than 6‚Äì9 km in diameter with a conical-bowl shape, little wall collapse, and it lacks a well-developed central feature, like a central peak. Zumba is of special interest to scientists, because it possesses interesting features that are typically buried or eroded away in other older Martian craters, and even within the freshest terrestrial craters, including Meteor crater in Arizona. These preserved and newly recognized features observed at the scale of HiRISE may reveal new aspects of the impact process. MRO's CTX A pitted deposit giving Zumba the appearance that it has a relatively flat floor despite the pits is especially interesting. These crater-fill deposits are typically composed of lightly to highly damaged rock fragments and impact melts that were made by the high temperatures of the impact event. The pits in the crater-fill deposits have not been observed within lunar or terrestrial craters. They are unique to crater-fill deposits in only the freshest and best-preserved Martian craters. These pits may result from the interactions of hot crater-fill deposits with water and water-ice that may have been present in the subsurface prior to impact. It is not well understood whether these pits form explosively (similar to terrestrial volcanic pits/craters formed from the interaction of hot lava with wet sediments/deposits), or by collapse from the drainage of impact melts or volatiles. Since the pitted deposits occur only in the freshest and well- preserved craters suggests that they are likely related to the impact process.http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_003608_1510Boyce, J. et al. 2012.

As of early 2016, a total of 32 cases had been reported in the medical literature. Despite its rarity, TS is believed to be underdiagnosed, and the growing population of patients on immunosuppressive drug regimens suggests its incidence may rise. TS has been described as an emerging infectious disease. Symptoms and signs The disease is characterized by flesh-colored to erythematous (reddened) papules occurring in the central region of the face and sometimes elsewhere on the body, often accompanied by protrusive \\"spicules\\" or spines made of keratin and by alopecia of affected skin, typically the eyebrows and sometimes the eyelashes or scalp hairs. Pruritus (itching) has been described in about a third of reported cases. Facial papules are generally 1- to 3-mm in size. The condition is considered to be benign, but can be disfiguring; the spines are often prominent, and in later stages the affected facial skin thickens noticeably. Causes TS has been reported almost exclusively in immunocompromised patients, primarily organ transplant recipients on regimens of immunosuppressive drugs, and also in patients with hematolymphoid malignancies. As of 2016 there were no case reports in the literature describing cases of TS in patients with HIV-AIDS. There is compelling evidence that trichodysplasia spinulosa is caused by a polyomavirus called trichodysplasia spinulosa polyomavirus (TSPyV) or Human polyomavirus 8. There is evidence that exposure to the virus is common among healthy adults; estimates of seroprevalence (that is, prevalence of detectable antibodies against viral proteins) in immunocompetent adults range from 70 to 80% in different sample populations. TSPyV infects the skin, but viral DNA is rarely detectable there in asymptomatic individuals even if they possess antibodies to the virus indicating exposure. It is not known whether TS represents new primary infection or opportunistic reactivation of a latent infection. Mechanism The hyperproliferation of keratinocyte inner root sheath cells in which large aggregates of viral particles can be found suggests that TSPyV actively replicates in these cells. This is thought to underlie the clinical manifestations of TS. However, the precise mechanism is not well characterized. There is limited evidence implicating the large tumor antigen as responsible for inducing cellular proliferation through pathways involving phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRB). Diagnosis Overview of histological findings in trichodysplasia spinulosa. Top row (A1-A3) shows healthy control; bottom row (B1-B3) shows TS skin. Low-magnification-power overview (A1, B1); high-power representative examples of epidermis showing thickening of the skin (acanthosis) in TS (A2, B2); high-power representative examples of hair follicles showing enlarged and dysmorphic appearance in TS (A3, B3). Inset in B3 shows characteristic eosinophilic protein granules, probably trichohyalin (arrowheads). H&E; stain. Scale bars are 100Œºm. TS can be diagnosed based on clinical observations, but is usually confirmed by histopathology of a lesional biopsy or a plucked spicule. Characteristic histological findings include enlarged and abnormally organized hair follicles and hyperproliferation of inner root sheath cells containing large eosinophilic trichohyalin granules. Antibodies against major capsid protein VP1, the major component of the viral capsid, can be used to confirm the presence of viral particles in cell nuclei. Electron microscopy can also be used to detect viral particles. Quantification of viral load can be performed using quantitative PCR, as affected skin demonstrates much higher viral loads compared to unaffected skin or to asymptomatic individuals who test positive for viral DNA. Differential diagnosis includes other visually similar conditions affecting the hair follicles, many of which appear as drug side effects. A proposed classification system lists TS as one of a group of cutaneous conditions with similar manifestations and distinct etiologies, collectively called the digitate keratoses. Although confirmed TS is rare, the condition is thought to be underdiagnosed. Treatment There have been too few cases of TS reported for a standard treatment to be established. In some cases, improvement in immune function has been noted to produce spontaneous improvement in TS symptoms. This pattern is consistent with the behavior of other viral diseases found in immunocompromised patients, most relevantly with the nephropathy associated in kidney transplant recipients with the polyomavirus BK virus. Antiviral drugs such as valganciclovir and cidofovir have shown benefit in treating this disorder in case reports. Outcomes TS is considered to be a benign dysplasia, although it can be disfiguring and is sometimes itchy. It is not known whether TS lesions have the potential to develop into cancer; while this outcome has never been reported, some polyomaviruses are oncogenic. The natural history of untreated TS is not known and no long-term studies of its progress have been performed. Improvement in immune function has been reported to resolve symptoms in some individual cases. Treatment with antiviral drugs has also been reported to improve symptoms, but only as long as treatment continues. History TS was first described in a 1995 case report as \\"ciclosporin-induced folliculodystrophy\\", thought at the time to be an adverse effect of ciclosporin treatment. A subsequent report in 1999, which introduced the term \\"trichodysplasia spinulosa\\", used electron microscopy to identify the presence of virus particles in affected cells consistent with what were at the time known as papovaviruses. (The group has since been divided into the papillomavirus and polyomavirus families.) In 2010, researchers used rolling circle amplification to recover viral DNA from TS lesions and thus discovered a novel polyomavirus, trichodysplasia spinulosa polyomavirus (TSPyV). There is compelling evidence that TSPyV is the direct causative agent of TS.

Fuller responded December 2017: \\"On the night of the coup attempt in Turkey last year I happened to have been addressing a group of 100 people or so right here in the town in western Canada where I have been living for the past 15 years.\\" \\"I have not set foot in Turkey in the last five years.\\" An unnamed U.S. official who was cited in a news report responded, \\"The notion that current or former employees of the United States Government were involved in the failed coup is absurd.\\" =Islamic State= A 2014 interview with Fuller quotes him as follows: \\"I think the United States is one of the key creators of [ISIS]. The United States did not plan the formation of ISIS, but its destructive interventions in the Middle East and the war in Iraq were the basic causes of the birth of ISIS.

The land today is in private ownership, and little remains above ground. However, the Pennoyer Centre in Pulham St Mary holds an extensive archive of photographs and memorabilia relating to the Air Station. History Pulham was one of the main British airship stations, with more than 3,000 men on the base at the end of the First World War. Initially it was used for airships that operated patrols over the North Sea (such as the Coastal and SS types) until their areas were taken over by seaplanes. The R34 landed at RNAS Pulham to complete the first two-way flown crossing of the Atlantic in July 1919. left After the loss of the R101 in 1930 and the end of British airships the station was moved on to a care and maintenance basis only. In its heyday Pulham had its own hydrogen plant, one small and two large airship sheds (one was later moved to Cardington base in 1930, the other was scrapped in 1948) and a permanent mooring mast. During World War II, Pulham Air Station was used as an aircraft salvage yard. The RAF used Pulham for storage and Maintenance Unit work until closure in 1958.

Biography Born in Esperanza, Santa Fe (Argentina) of Swiss and German ancestry, is a self-taught artist (painter, illustrator, stage designer) and music journalist, related from his mother side to writer Eduardo Gudi√±o Kieffer (1935‚Äì2002), also a native of Esperanza, the first formally organized of the agricultural colonies in Argentina, formed by 200 families of immigrants from Switzerland, Germany, France and Luxembourg who arrived in Santa Fe in 1856. [1] He spent his childhood in is hometown Esperanza in the Argentinian countryside (the Pampas) and in the Atlantic Coast in Mar del Plata moving with his family to Buenos Aires in 1973.

As a result, many were chosen as cover illustrations for the Florida Philharmonic Orchestra Playbills, along with the New World Symphony 1995-96 Season Program Book, the Florida Grand Opera 1998-99 Season Program and Poster and other local music organizations as Seraphic Fire, Mainly Mozart Festival and as CD covers in recordings of, among others, composer Henryk Gorecki, Astor Piazzolla, Ildebrando Pizzetti [4] and the Grammy Award Da Pacem with works by Arvo P√§rt [3] Since 1988 Spreng writes about Classical music for magazines, newspapers and his blog Miami Clasica. His career writing about music began as foreign correspondent for Cl√°sica Magazine, Argentina. He is a member of the Music Critics Association of North America and as music journalist he interviewed, among others personalities in that field, composer Luciano Berio, conductors Donald Runnicles, Nicholas McGegan, James Judd, Pablo Heras-Casado, Ram√≥n Tebar and Michael Tilson Thomas; director Harold Prince, singers Dawn Upshaw, Montserrat Caball√©, Renata Scotto, Thomas Hampson, Barbara Hendricks, Evelyn Lear, Thomas Stewart (bass-baritone), Anne Sofie von Otter, Luca Pisaroni, Christine Brewer, Bernarda Fink and Deborah Voigt; pianist Evgeny Kissin, Javier Perianes, Jean-Yves Thibaudet; cellists David Finckel, Sol Gabetta and Amit Peled, violinists Joshua Bell, Gil Shaham, Pinchas Zukerman and the Emerson String Quartet.[7] Critic Assessments * Lilia Fontana, art critic and director of the Miami Dade College Kendall Campus Art Gallery wrote in the catalog to his exhibition in Coral Gables, 2002: He is a minimalist at heart, but he combines the feeling of isolation from an Edward Hopper painting with the Color Field technique of a Mark Rothko. The result is a mixture of components creating an original Spreng. He has formed a bridge between the psychological and the physical. In his previous work he partnered a solitary figure within a vast seascape. A single swimmer floating alone in the water, created a sense of isolation, whereas the autonomous swimmer had no boundaries, possibly a romanticized longing by the artist to set his own body free. This figure, though small in its surroundings, seemed to have had domain of its environment ‚Äì able to float away on a whim devoid of any imparities. Within his newer work, the swimmer is transferred into an arbor, and it is juxtaposed within a panoramic landscape somewhat agoraphobic. Much of the landscapes are inspired from Las Pampas in Argentina, but its aesthetics is exclusively American with European roots. The work references the Romantic landscape. Each piece has a painted line around the composition, creating a self-contained frame within a frame. Spreng creates for the viewer the illusion of looking through a window and witnessing his phantasmic world. They are simple arrangements, where trees become biomorphic forms enclosed in a Rothkoesque background. Layer upon layer of textured passages richly create his surface. His compositions generate stillness and a delicate balance of forms accentuating a harmonious interaction. Spreng's personal aesthetic and individual style is unmistakable. He has recontextualized Las Pampas into an oniric American formation.[4] * Dr. Carol Damian, director of the Frost Art Museum at the Florida International University, Miami wrote: Sebastian Spreng's paintings demonstrate the essence of simplicity, visual abstractions of form and color; however, upon close examination it is quite evident that technically they are anything but simple. As Sebastian Spreng searches for the means to create haunting accolades to the memory of time and place, his paintings have become more luminous. On the brink of total abstraction, they are saturated with a pervasive ambience that glows with mystery. They allow the viewer moments of introspection and a glimpse into the past.[5] * Art critic Ricardo Pau-Llosa wrote in 1991: Among the many artists who live in south Florida few have contemplated its environment with passion and freshness of Sebastian Spreng, a painter born in Buenos Aires in 1956. Spreng came to Miami with an impressive list of triumphs but it was not until he reached Florida that he found the central theme of his work: man's presence between the faces of the planet-land and sea.... Spreng articulates the paradox of human Being-although man alone is agent and consciousness, he is but one of life's beings. All landscape seeks its destiny in reflection, seeks to become the indispensable verb in an idea or an attitude towards life. In the paintings of Spreng the chimera of landfall which we call Florida has accomplished a part of his destiny[6] * Art critic Janet Batet wrote in reference to his Liederkreis in 2009: As if the differences between one proposal and the other were not sufficient, Spreng delves into another element that is not found in painting: time. While music occurs throughout time, painting is subjected to a set time, one that is static and frozen on the canvas. It is not for nothing that painting is associated with timelessness and transcendence. Nevertheless, Spreng subverts this limitation by creating in the pictorial space a feeling of cycle or evolution, achieved thanks to the influence of the ever-changing horizon. The exhibition is impregnated by a clear romantic spirit that is dominated by musical borrowings, a predilection for open scenes, and the subjective nature of the images. It compels the viewer to search for elements unnoticed during its first reading; elements lost or distant, or barely suggested by a horizon always acting with unifying purpose, as it represents both the cohesive element and the driver of change. * Art critic Elisa Turner wrote in ARTnews magazine (September 2011 issue) about his Salad Bar exhibition: \\"Gazing at the lyrical juxtapositions of imagery in 'Salad Bar' recalls the experience of reading a passage of stream- of-consciousness prose....With a sure sense of color and scale, Spreng navigates the gap between the minute and the majestic.\\" Selected bibliography *Alvarez Bravo, Armando. \\"Los viajes del sue√±o\\", El Nuevo Herald, Miami, 5/25/03 *Alvarez Bravo, Armando. \\"Las reverberaciones de Sebastian Spreng\\", El Nuevo Herald, Miami, 12/19/99 *Alvarez Bravo, Armando. \\"Los necesarios oasis\\", El Nuevo Herald, Miami, 16/11/97 *Alvarez Bravo, Armando.

The area is of particular historical and naturalistic interest. Today the island belongs to the Province of Perugia and is actually known as a Scientific-Didactic Park, that takes part of Trasimeno Regional Park. The island is a part of Castiglione del Lago.  History  The island was visited by Etruscans and by Romans. In the Middle Ages the inhabitants submitted to Perugia. In that period some churches and the castle were erected to protect and defend the little village. We know, that the monks of Benedictine and Domanican orders were present on the island. Since 1841 the island became private property and was used as a hunting area. In 1973 the Province of Perugia acquired Polvese Island.  Monuments  Among the most important monuments of the island are church of Saint Giuliano and Saint Secondo, the Olivetans‚Äô Monastery and the Medieval Castle. The garden of Aquatic Plants was realized in 1959 by the architect Pietro Porcinai.  Landscape  In the northern part a huge oak woodland covers the island with many plant varieties which are typical for the mediterranean area, as holm and ash tree. In the lower wood we find guelder rose, laurel, ilex and privet. The southern area is covered by a huge olive grove with centuries old olive trees. The humid area is characterized by an extended reed thicket that grows along from the east to the south. Ornamental plants and trees are present all along the meadows while rosemary hedges and pomegranate characterize the paths and the inner part of the island. The natural environs lodge a rich fauna of invertebrates, especially insects. Among the vertebrates we find the fox, the marten, the hare, the nutria and a great choice of birds, especially the ones, that live in humid climates such as coots, ducks and herons.  Activities  The island offers today an example of management according to sustainable criteria. The activities offered by the Environmental Experience Center on the island concern didactic and environmental tourism. Guided tours of different duration offer an interaction with the habitat that surrounds you.

The church of San Miniato al Monte is dedicated to him. According to legend, he was an Armenian king or prince serving in the Roman Army ‚Äì or making a penitential pilgrimage to Rome ‚Äì who had decided to become a hermit near Florence. He was denounced as a Christian and in 250 AD brought before Emperor Decius, who was persecuting Christians. Miniato refused to sacrifice to the Roman gods, and was put through numerous torments ‚Äì he was thrown into a furnace, was lapidated, and was thrown to a lion or a panther at an amphitheater ‚Äì from which he emerged unharmed. Finally, he was beheaded near the present Piazza della Signoria, but his legend states that he picked up his own head. Miniato then crossed the Arno and returned to his hermitage on the hill known as Mons Florentinus (Monte di Firenze). Veneration Minias‚Äô relics rest in a crypt in the church dedicated to him, begun by Alibrando (Hildebrand), Bishop of Florence, in 1013 and endowed by Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor. The historicity of the saint is uncertain. It is possible that there was a saint with this name who was martyred near the Arno. He may simply have been a soldier who was executed for spreading Christianity in the army. His cult may also have arisen from the fact that a relic from a location in the East, such as Egypt, was brought to the church that would be known as San Miniato.

Part of the Swan Collection, bequest of great-granddaughter Miss Elizabeth Howard Bartol (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) Portrait of General Henry Jackson by Gilbert Stuart, c. 1805 Hepzibah Swan n√©e Clarke (died August 14, 1825) was an American socialite of Boston, Massachusetts. She was a wealthy and well connected heiress who was among the most cosmopolitan, intelligent, and erudite of ladies in Federal Boston. Madame Swan was said to be charismatic, not least because of her wealth but also in good measure because of her effusive personal charm. Lifelong friends included revolutionary war heroes Henry Knox, Henry Jackson, Charles Bulfinch, Sarah Wentworth Apthorp Morton, and Harrison Otis. Mrs. Swan's house and garden, Tremont Street, Boston, 1800 Life In 1776 she married Scotland-born James Swan,Dictionary of American biography. and in the course of the marriage had four children: Hepzibah, Christiana, Sarah and James. With her close friend Sarah Wentworth Aprthorp Morton, they founded the Sans Souci Club in Boston, which revelled without regret. Her estranged husband, James Swan, who lived out his adult life in splendour in a Paris debtors' prison, also sat for his portrait that was painted by Gilbert Stuart. She was to commission a portrait of her longtime companion, General Henry Jackson (1747‚Äì1809) who is also buried in the family lot at Forest Hills Cemetery. But while this sophisticated and charming doyenne of Boston society was said to have enjoyed the rapt attention of many, she was also said to be a pendant to no one man in particular, neither in her long and eventful life nor in her soignee portrait. Swan commissioned several portraits from painter Gilbert Stuart, including one of her husband, and those of her friends Henry Knox and Henry Jackson, and others. Her own portrait was also painted by Stuart, and is now in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Hepzibah and James Swan were both pro French; Mrs. Swan in particular was a devout Francophile all her life. During the war they entertained French naval officers stationed at Newport who brought their ships to Boston for repair, refitting and supplies. On his return to Boston James built a grand countryseat on Dudley Street in Dorchester not far from Royal Governor Shirley's mansion. Swan had purchased the land in 1781 when he was adjutant general of the Commonwealth. It was a 60-acre estate with a house near the road that the State of Massachusetts had confiscated from Loyalist Nathaniel Hatch. Hatch and 1000 other Tories had fled with the British army to Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1776. Planned in large part in the French style by Mrs. Swan, she consulted with another prot√©g√© and close friend, the architect Charles Bulfinch, who is given attribution for the design of the most remarkable house of its time in the region. The mansion was set on a high earth berm facing east across Dorchester Bay. Completed in 1796, its signature architectural feature was a two-story circular drawing room 32 feet in circumference with a domed ceiling. The bow was pulled out from two traditional Federal style wings and surrounded by a colonnade. Everyone called it the Round House and Mrs. Swan filled it with French furnishings; much of it appropriated by the republican French government from royal palaces and sold to Swan's import company. Several pieces are now in the collections of the Sargent House Museum, Gloucester, MA and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/armchair-57589 Mrs. Swan bought out two of the original investors in the largest and most far reaching real estate venture in postwar Boston when she became the only female member of the four person Mount Vernon Proprietors that acquired the John Singleton Copley pasture in 1796. It was subdivided into townhouse lots that became very valuable when the State House opened in 1798. Mrs. Swan built three houses on the land for her daughters at 13, 15 + 17 Chestnut Street (built in 1805 and 1807) and her own townhouse at 16 Chestnut Street in 1817. Jackson assessed the property and handled all financial transactions on all four homes, each designed by Charles Bulfinch, who seemed now to be among the members of her salon. In 1791, no doubt at the urging of Mrs. Swan, Jackson and others helped pass legislation which repealed the 1750 law against theater performances. Roxbury state senator William Heath was probably helpful. Jackson was trustee of the Boston Theatre ‚Äì Boston's first ‚Äì designed by Charles Bulfinch, at the corner of Federal and Franklin streets, that opened in 1793. Jackson managed the household affairs as well. He was very close to the daughters. He organized and managed the marriage of oldest daughter Hepzibah to Dr. John Clarke Howard, grandson of John Clarke in 1800 and in 1802 the wedding of Sarah Swan to William Sullivan son of James Sullivan. Mrs. Swan disapproved of her middle daughter's fianc√© John Turner Sargent (his brothers were Daniel Sargent, Henry Sargent and Lucius Manlius Sargent, first cousin of Judith Sargent Murray, nephew of Paul Dudley Sargent). Yet despite that Christiana ‚Äì obviously as strong willed as her mother ‚Äì married him anyway, in 1806, and Mrs. Swan built them a townhouse on Chestnut Street. (John and Christiana named their second son Henry Jackson Sargent) Her son James Keadie Swan married Caroline Knox, the daughter of Henry Knox, in 1808. At the time of the wedding Mrs. Swan commissioned Gilbert Stuart to paint a portrait of her son and also of herself. Hepzibah Swan had Henry Jackson interred in a tomb she built in her back garden. The tomb was raised on an earth berm surrounded by a hedge of lilacs and surmounted by an obelisk of blue marble probably quarried and made in Italy. On it was carved \\"Henry Jackson. Soldier, Patriot, Friend\\".Boston Globe July 7, 1893 A lane of lilacs led from the house to the tomb that Mrs. Swan often visited and pointed out to guests. One of them was the Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette in June 1825, on his triumphal visit to Boston for the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Bunker Hill. He visited Mrs. Swan on his way to Quincy to see John Adams. The Marquis and Mrs. Swan talked in French for over an hour and no doubt Mrs. Swan walked him out to look at the tomb of Revolutionary War General Henry Jackson. Hepzibah Swan died two months later, probably of cholera, on August 14, 1825. She was buried in General Jackson's tomb.She joined her son-in-law John Turner Sargent. When he died in 1813, she had him buried in the Jackson tomb The house and grounds were left to Christiana Sargent who lived there until her death in 1867 at the age of 89. Her home on Chestnut Street is a site on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail. References Further reading  * Allen Chamberlain.

Exceptional fossils have has been found in the Messel Pit of Germany. Macrocranion species are often described as forest-floor predators, about the size of small squirrels but with longer limbs. The genus is represented at the Messel Pit site by two species, M. tupaidon and M. tenerum. Restoration of M. tenerum M. tupaiodon had woolly fur with no spikes. Although possibly an omnivore, fossil remains indicate the specimen had eaten fish near the time of its death. This small animal was approximately fifteen cm in length, with long back legs capable of considerable speed. The fossil of M. tenerum is five cm long. The species also had long legs for rapid movement, but its fur included a spiky protection. The long legs, however, indicate the animal couldn't have effectively rolled up for defense. Fossilized stomach remains show that M. tenerum's diet included ants, so it may have been an insectivore. The oldest species are M. vandebroeki from the Paleocene-Eocene transition of Northern Europe and M. junnei from the Wasatchian (Early Eocene) of Wyoming.

He attended a private junior high school in Tokyo, Nihon University Dai-ni Junior High, and met Wakabayashi there when they were 8th graders. Wakabayashi, a trouble-making kid sitting just behind Kasuga, played with him, sneakily cutting his hair from behind without telling him. In spite of Wakabayashi's misbehavior, Kasusga's first impression on Wakabayashi was that he was a \\"cute boy\\", and they got along. They also attended the same high school, Nihon University Dai- ni High School and joined the American Football Club. Kasuga was chosen as a member of the Kanto's all-star American Football Team as a defensive end. However, a penny-pincher, Kasuga did not want to buy outdoor shoes for astro turf that players were suggested to wear for the all-star game, and improperly wearing indoor shoes, was replaced soon after the game had started.Oshareism (Nippon Broadcasting), 1/25/2009 After his high school years, Wakabayashi invited Kasuga to be his manzai partner. However, Kasuga decided to attend Nihon University instead. He spent his university years by taking part-time jobs such as a sales clerk position at Seibu Dome. He mentioned that one day a Glay concert was held there while he was working, and he was very moved after ten years when he was invited to Glay vocalist Teru's birthday party as his favorite aspiring comedian.Kasuga's blog \\"Kasuga\\" Attending mass communication seminars, Kasuga initially planned to be a TV producer while Wakabayashi kept inviting Kasuga to start a comedy career.Ame-talk (TV Asahi), 5/14/2009 Finally Kasuga accepted his offer, and they formed a comedy duo, \\"Nice Middle\\", in 2000.  Dark days to M-1 Grand Prix 2008  Although they happily jumped into a comedy career, they stayed unsuccessful for several years. One day, six years since their debut, a TV play writer called Wakabayashi in person and told him \\"Kasuga has no talent as a tsukkomi. If you want to play a boke, you'd better look for another partner.\\" Wakabayashi, then the boke of the duo, relayed the comment to the then tsukkomi Kasuga, but he initially thought Wakabashi was just joking around and did not believe him at all.Ame- talk (TV Asahi), 5/14/2009 They eventually swapped their roles, went through a trial-and-error process, and finally they made the first appearance on terrestrial TV on New Year's Day of 2008. On December 21, 2008, the two made it all the way into the final round of the M-1 Grand Prix of the year from the consolation match. During the first session in the final, they were temporarily in the top position above the other eight duos, but eventually ended up 2nd behind Non Style.  Rise to popularity  Shaving his sideburns (a hair style called a \\"techno-cut\\"), wearing his hair parted \\"80/20\\" (80% of the hair is combed to the right and the rest to the left) and a pink sweater vest, Kasuga, a unique arrogant character, has been broadly accepted by audiences since the M-1 Grand Prix. In October 2009, Kasuga was chosen with Wakabayashi as a new regular member for \\"Waratte Iitomo\\", the nation's most popular afternoon TV show, and a radio personality for \\"All Night Nippon\\", one of the longest-running radio programs in Japan.  Character on stage  Kasuga walks heavily and slowly with his proud 101 cm chest expanding toward the center of the stage. At the opening, he drops a bossy comment to female audiences such as \\"Would you like to deliver Kasuga's baby?\\" In manzai, he tries to shoot tsukkomi and each time it turns out to be terribly off-the-line boke. Also, he interrupts Wakabayashi's talks with delayed responses and frequent gags. In manzai and talk, he responds back saying \\"Oui\\" (\\"Yes\\"). Holding up his index finger, he yells \\"Toos!\\" meaning \\"Hey!\\" or \\"I did it!\\" Some of his other recurring gags include \\"Onigawara\\", \\"Apa\\" and the \\"Kasu\\" dance.  Penny pincher  His stingy life style has been introduced in many variety shows. He says that he wants to save as much money as possible to buy a single-family home in the future.  Personal life  He is described as reserved, polite and modest, contrary to his character on TV. Wakabayashi has said he has never heard Kasuga speaking bad about others. Mikio Date, a member of owarai duo Sandwichman has also said Kasuga had neither spoken ill of others nor agreed with other comedians' bad comments on others at their joint live rehearsals.Sandwichiman's Radio Yarasero (Kari) (FM Izumi), 5/5/2009 His father has been very supportive of his career, making original DVDs of Kasuga to distribute to the family's neighbors, and frequently giving him advice by e-mail.All Night Nippon R (Nippon Broadcasting), 2/28/2009 Though initially against his comedy career, his mother is also supportive, distributing to neighbors the Playboy magazine when one of the issues carried an article on Kasuga.Utaban (Tokyo Broadcasting System), 5/24/2009 According to Kasuga, all of his family members are big-boned. His mother used to be a softball player. Kasuga had a fanatical female fan called \\"Ochimusha\\" (stray samurai) when he was a football player in high school.Ame-talk (TV Asahi), 5/14/2009 From the age of 20, he had a girlfriend (called \\"Dogu\\" (clay doll) by Wakabayashi) for five years. When he dated her, his friends called him \\"Moai\\" due to his big head, and named the two \\"the mysterious couple.\\" She later said on the TV program \\"London Hearts\\" that he was gentle, but she separated from him because she did not like his indecisiveness.London Hearts (TV Asahi), 4/28/2009 On the show, unexpectedly meeting her at a bar, he got very nervous and passed her once but looked back at her repeatedly. (He just looked like he was \\"spinning around.\\")London Hearts (TV Asahi), 4/28/2009 On his birthday, February 9, 2009, he was photographed by a paparazzo during the night while he was dating a 30-year-old woman who, according to Wakabayashi, resembles the \\"Hippo of Isodin.\\" (One of Japanese confectionery/pharmaceutical company Meiji Seika's anime characters. See the \\"External Links\\" section below). Kasuga later said that he was going to make her his girlfriend, but after the photo's publication, he was unsuccessful in reaching her.All Night Nippon R (Nippon Broadcasting), 2/28/2009 In April, 2019, Kasuga proposed to his girlfriend of 11 years \\"Kumi-san\\" on the television variety Monitoring.

Padmasri Dr. Nataraja Ramakrishna was the person who revived this art form recently. The dance The Perini siva Thandavam is a dance form usually performed by males. It is called 'Dance of Warriors'.

The dance form, Perini, reached its pinnacle during the rule of the 'Kakatiyas' who established their dynasty at Warangal and ruled for almost two centuries. The Perini Thandavam, Telangana It is believed that this dance form invokes 'Prerana' (inspiration) and is dedicated to supreme dancer, Lord Siva. One can find evidence of this dance in the sculptures near Garbha Gudi (Sanctum Sanctorum) of the Ramappa Temple at Warangal. Perini is a vigorous dance done to the resounding beats of drums. Dancers drive themselves to a state of mental abstraction where they feel the power of Siva in their body. While dancing they invoke Siva to come into him and dance through him. The Perini Thandavam is indeed believed to be the most invigorating and intoxicating male dance form. Perini dance form almost disappeared after the decline of the Kakatiya dynasty but Padmasri Dr. Nataraja Ramakrishna brought renaissance in Perini dance, which was on verge of extinction.

An opening batsman for much of his career, and occasional bowler in his final seasons, Harris played in West Indian first class cricket, as well as facing the MCC team, England and Australia during his career. He played 27 matches, scoring nearly 1,400 runs at 29.04, including a century, and taking 15 wickets at 19.46. He then went on to play lower-level cricket for St. Kitts until 1976, and helped create the first cricket academy in the Leeward Islands. CareerLeeward Islands= Harris played his first match for Leeward Islands on 5 July 1958, against Jamaica at Melbourne Park, in Kingston, Jamaica. Opening the batting, he made 69 and 14, but did not bowl as Jamaica took an innings victory. Harris did not play again that season, however his efforts in this once match were enough for him to reach fourth place in the first-class averages, behind Gary Sobers. Harris did not get a second chance in first- class cricket until 25 February 1960, when he was selected to play against the touring MCC side at the Antigua Recreation Ground. In this match, he batted at three, scoring 16 and 89*. His bowling, two overs for 15 runs, was however expensive, and centuries from MCC players Colin Cowdrey, Raman Subba Row and Ted Dexter put paid to any hope of a result as the match ended in a draw. Harris waited over another year before playing in a combined Leeward and Windward Islands team against British Guiana on 6 October 1961, in Georgetown. Harris continued his success at the top of the order, scoring 54 in the first innings. He took a catch to dismiss Clyde Walcott, however he did not bowl once again, and made only one in the third innings as his team collapsed to 84 all out and an innings defeat. Sporadic appearances continued, Harris' next appearance coming on 21 April 1962, against a touring Indian team - once again for the combined Leeward and Windward Islands team. Harris played weakly in both innings, falling for six and 12 as India took victory by 137 runs. It was then three more years before Harris played in a first-class match. On 12 March 1965, the touring Australian side faced the Leeward Islands in Basseterre. Batting at three, Harris made only nine as Australia reduced the home side to 178 all our, and then hit 417 runs. Leeward Islands were routed for 208 in the second innings, however Harris enjoyed success, scoring the second highest total of his team's innings, 44. He then faced the Windward Islands later that year on 25 November at Roseau, where he scored 62. The following year, on 27 January, he scored 41 and 52 against Jamaica, and on 9 February was dismissed for one but took two catches in a rain-interrupted match against Barbados. Matches against British Guiana and Trinidad and Tobago followed through 1966, yielding scores of 61, 13, zero and 39 from the top order. 1965/66 was Harris' most eventful season thus far in his career, and he ended it with 276 runs from five matches at 34.50. 1967 saw three more matches for Leeward Islands against Barbados, Jamaica and the Windward Islands. In the first match, on 9 February, Harris faced Barbados in Warner Park, Basseterre, and scored 18 and 10. He also bowled two deliveries before Barbados declared for 406. Against Jamaica he scored 91 - then a career best - and 15, and against Windward Islands on 27 March at Sturge Park, in the now abandoned Plymouth, Montserrat, where he scored 33. He then faced the MCC for a second time on 15 February 1968, also in Plymouth. He hit 48 and 18 in a match largely dominated by a knock of 165 from Geoffrey Boycott. With his efforts in the 1968 season, he broke the Leeward Islands' batting record. On 17 January 1969, he scored zero and 30 against Barbados, and on 12 February scored 17 and 12, and took once wicket for 14 runs against Guyana. Harris then played four successive matches in early 1970, the first against Windward Islands on 16 January at Warner Park. This was followed by matches against Barbados on 13 February; Trinidad and Tobago on 6 March; and Jamaica on 14 March. The season overall netted Harris 207 runs at 20.70, with one half-century of 72, from the five matches. 1971, his final year in first-class cricket, began with a match against the Windward Islands on 14 January at Warner Park. Harris, batting at five, scored his maiden - and only - century. His knock of 105 took Leeward to 315 all out, having bowled Windward Islands over for 122. Three catches by Harris off the bowling of Jeffers Warrington helped restrict Windward Islands to 153 all out in their second innings, giving Leeward Islands victory by an innings and 40 runs. Harris could not carry this form over, however. Scores of six and four saw Barbados home by nine wickets on 22 January, and 35, 23 and the wicket of West Indian international Bryan Davis could not prevent an innings defeat to Trinidad and Tobago on 27 January. This season was, however, his most successful with the ball taking career best figures of 12 wickets at 15.41.\`This included a productive spell of four wickets at the cost of three runs. 3 February 1971, saw Harris face Guyana in Roseau. He scored 12 and 60, and took two catches, seeing his team to victory by 50 runs and 12 points in the Shell Shield. India toured the West Indies in 1971, and faced Leeward Islands on 25 February, with Harris scoring 18 and 24 as the home team fell to a heavy nine wicket defeat at Warner Park. Harris' final match against Jamaica, on 27 March, saw his side defeated by an innings and 82 at the hands of Jamaica. Harris himself took 1/25 from eight overs during Jamaica's first innings, and scored 18 and zero. His final season held six matches - the most of his career - and saw him hit 305 runs - again a personal best - at 30.50. =St. Kitts= Basseterre, looking north, the setting for Harris' Cricket Academy. Harris continued to be involved in cricket outside of the first-class arena by playing for St. Kitts - who he had joined in 1970 - until the end of the 1976 cricket season. He had played two matches for St. Kitts in 1970, scoring 24 against Montserrat at Warner Park on 10 July, and five and 54 against Nevis in the semi-final and final of the Hesketh Bell Shield. Harris played two further matches against the same sides in 1971, including a 103-knock against Monsterrat on 27 June, and scores of 11 and 29 against Nevis in July. Two matches of the same competition in 1974 saw scores of 28, 82, and two. He faced Monsterrat again in 1976, scoring 46 and 10 on 19 June, and then scored three against Nevis in his final match, on 2 July 1976. Following his career as a player, Harris worked in conjunction with Carib Brewery to create the Carib Brewery-Len Harris Cricket Academy, named in his honour, at Warner Park. It was the first Academy of its kind in the Leeward Islands. In 2003, Keith Arthurton, former West Indies Test and ODI player, took over the positions of coach and manager there from Ingleton Liburd, who went on to be the Leeward Islands' Cricket Development Officer for the West Indies Cricket Board. The Chairman, Charles Wilkin, said of the Academy: \\"The Academy has been generally successful, producing over half of the current St Kitts team, we have players who made it into West Indies Under-19 team, and into the Leewards team. We have a crop of promising young cricketers, and more to come.\\" Playing style Harris was a successful opening batsman for Leeward Islands during his career. Preferring the on-side, but also successful with the off drive, Harris averaged 73 in opening partnerships with Oscar Williams. In 1998, Viv Richards referred to Harris one of \\"the greats of the Leeward Islands\\" in his A Spirit of Dominance.Richards, p. 63. West Indian journalist Timothy Alfred referred to Harris as a batsman \\"of tremendous talent\\" who \\"unfortunately was not able to secure a place on the then power pack West Indies team.\\" The Academy continues to play club cricket in St. Kitts against Newton, Cayon, Sandy Point, St. Paul's and the local police force team.

He was a Member of the European Parliament for Hungary in the 2009‚Äì2014 session. He was the leader of the Movement for a Modern Hungary, which he founded in April 2013, and sat in the European Conservatives and Reformists group in the European Parliament. The Bokros package was named after him. Financial career Bokros was born in Budapest. He graduated from and holds a Ph.D. from the Budapest University of Economics. He successfully applied for the scholarship of University of Panama in 1976, where he learned to speak fluent Spanish. He wrote his dissertation on the industrialization, integration and common market developments in Central America. He was director of the State Property Agency of Hungary between 1990‚Äì1991. He was chairman and chief executive officer at the Budapest Bank between 1991‚Äì1995. He is a full professor (Department of Public Policy) and former chief operating officer of the Central European University. Bokros was the Minister of Finance between 1995‚Äì1996 in the government of Gyula Horn. He is best known for the so-called \\"Bokros package\\"; a string of austerity measures implemented during his term as Finance Minister. He resigned from his position in February 1996. He was replaced by P√©ter Medgyessy. Between 1997 and 2000, Lajos Bokros was Director for Private Sector and Finance at the World Bank. There, together with Stjn Claessens, Simeon Djankov, and Gerhard Pohl he worked on enterprise restructuring in Georgia, Moldova, and Romania. As director, Lajos Bokros also led the assistance in restructuring the Russian banking sector after the 1997-1998 banking crisis. Political career Supported by the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), Bokros was elected to the European Parliament in the 2009 election and sat in the European Conservatives and Reformists Group. He was a full member of the Committee on Budgets and a substitute member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Bokros' nomination indicated a change of political position from conservative to liberal ideology. As a result, several prominent members left the party, including P√©ter Olajos, K√°lm√°n Katona and former Prime Minister P√©ter Boross.Boross P√©ter szak√≠tott a D√°vid vezette MDF-fel, Heti Vil√°ggazdas√°g, 18 June 2009 With MP Andr√°s Cs√°ky's quit, the Hungarian Democratic Forum's parliamentary group defunct according to the house rules in March 2009.Le√©p√≠t az MDF, Index.hu, 19 March 2009 He was the MDF's candidate for the position of Prime Minister of Hungary on the 2010 Hungarian parliamentary election.

The game is not a sequel to the previous game Aliens versus Predator 2, but a reboot based on the Alien vs. Predator franchise, a combination of the characters and creatures of the Alien franchise and the Predator franchise. Gameplay There are three campaigns in the game, one for each race/faction (the Colonial Marines, the Aliens, and the Predators), that, while separate in terms of individual plot and gameplay, form one overarching storyline. Following the storyline of the campaign modes comes the multiplayer aspect of the game. In this Multiplayer section of the game, players face off in various game types in various ways. =Marine= The Colonial Marine campaign is far closer to that of a standard first-person shooter. Marines carry a wide arsenal including pulse rifles, flamethrowers, and auto-tracking smartguns. To help navigate the surroundings, marines are equipped with shoulder-mounted lamps, surveying flares to briefly illuminate darkened areas, and motion trackers, capable of providing info on hostile positioning as they move. =Predator= As in the films, the Predator prefers to stalk its prey from the safety of treetops and the gameplay reflects this, the player leaping from branch to branch automatically with the help of a \\"focus jumping\\" game mechanic. The Predator has different vision modes, the most recognizable from the films being a thermal imaging scanner, but the player also has different vision modes for spotting Aliens (only accessible from a special mask the player picks up in-game) and viewing the world normally. For example, the Heat Vision mode allows the player to see Marines very clearly, while it renders Aliens nearly invisible; the Alien vision works in reverse, making aliens appear clearly and Marines nearly invisible. Regular vision allows one to see the environment and other Predators better than the former two visions, making battles between two or all three species a tactical juggle to prioritize enemies based on their threat to the player. The Predator's gameplay is more based on stealth and tactics than the average first-person shooter. The player has to be aware of Aliens, which have the ability to see through a Predator's cloaking device, that may climb up a tree and attack from below as well as taking care not to reveal themselves to marines too early as the marines‚Äô weaponry and numbers are more than a match for the Predator. For long-range weaponry, the Predator can use a shoulder- mounted plasma cannon in addition to a glaive-like disc and a combi stick (or throwing spear). For close-range combat, the Predator has four retractable wristblades on its arms. The wrist blades allow for the Predator to perform a \\"trophy kill\\", a nod to the movies in which the Predators take trophies, usually skulls, from their defeated enemies to show their prowess in the hunt. OXM labeled the trophy kill mechanic as \\"spectacularly violent\\" and it has been partially censored to avoid an Adults Only rating in the United States as it was \\"several measures more graphic\\" than any other recent games. There are several animations, one of which is a \\"terrified\\" marine dragged into the center of the screen by his or her throat, which the Predator then snaps effortlessly with the accompanying sound of \\"someone biting into raw celery\\". The neck broken, the Predator cuts the marine's head, a \\"sizeable portion\\" of the spinal cord following. Even after this, the marine is still alive for a short period of time, \\"gasping his last, with nothing but bloodied, glistening vertebral column beneath his chin.\\" A screenshot showing a player being attacked by a group of Aliens Jason Kingsley, the CEO of Rebellion, defended the brutality of the trophy-kill system, stating \\"This is obviously a game based on adult-rated movies, and we want to make sure it‚Äôs very clearly an adult-rated game. It's an issue for me; some computer games are for kids‚Äì we're not making a computer game here for anyone other than adults. That's very clear and within that context, I think the violence is part of the character and the world‚Äì so we're talking about a fantasy world here and fantasy creatures and we're talking about trying to build up a mythos. I remember the first time I saw it, one of the particular Predator kills, everyone went 'Oooh'. But it's what the Predator does in the movies.\\" The Predator campaign explains how their species considers the war tactics of the human Marines juvenile. A quote from the intro states: \\"We are old, my brother. Our race is few and scattered. Our ancestry lost to myth. The humans are still children, creatures of desire and hubris, with no comprehension of the long hunt. Still, they make good sport. They have discovered a trophy long locked away. They must not be allowed to find the crucible that spawned our most respected prey. If they succeed, all life will succumb to the crawling dark...\\". =Alien= Aliens fight in close-quarters combat with their claws and tails, getting as close as possible to their prey as quickly as possible. Aliens have the ability to climb walls and jump from distances without much effort and can blend in with shadows, using darkness to their advantage. Within limited ranges, aliens can seek out prey through walls. These senses also allow Aliens to clearly observe cloaked Predators. In the single-player campaign, players have the opportunity to harvest \\"hosts\\". By pinning the host, nearby facehuggers are able to locate and latch on to them, thereby propagating the Hive. Throughout the game, the player also has the opportunity to perform \\"stealth kills\\". Music This was Mark Rutherford's first video game score. It was 70 minutes of live orchestral score recorded in Slovakia with the Istropolis Philharmonic Orchestra. To create a unique and original sound for the Predator and the Alien he made his own percussion kits constructed from bits of metal and various tools which were then scraped and hit with nails, sticks, brushes, and mallets. PlotMarine= As a Marine, the game starts out above the planet, with two Marine squads on separate ships, one of which is identified as the USS Marlow. When the Predators' ship comes out of cloak and destroys the Marlow, Major Van Zandt directs the surviving shuttle to land. The player Marine, dubbed \\"Rookie\\", is knocked out during the drop, and regains consciousness in the heart of the chaos itself. At Corporal Tequila's direction, Rookie is sent into several parts of the wrecked human colony with the purpose of getting systems back online and locating any surviving Marines, especially Major Van Zandt. However, the Major is discovered cocooned; forcing Rookie to shoot him. Moving further into the newly established hive within the refinery, Rookie encounters an Alien queen and kills her in an explosion with some help from Tequila. Traversing the swamp, Rookie is contacted by Tequila on board a dropship coming to pick him up, but the ship comes under fire from a Predator and crashes before the rescue can be made. The now-stranded Rookie receives assistance from the colony's administrative android, Katya. Following Katya's instruction, Rookie is able to locate other survivors throughout the ruins and fights and kills a Predator before finally rescuing Tequila in the Alien hive; but not before she was implanted with a chestburster. Tequila asks the Rookie to shoot her, but Katya informs him that she can extract the alien via surgery. Weyland finds out about this during the procedure and cuts off the power. Rookie is forced to put Tequila into a stasis capsule to prevent the alien from \\"bursting\\" and killing her. With their dropship and the Marlow destroyed, Katya tells Rookie that Weyland has a datapad that can contact his personal dropship and get them off the planet. Rookie goes below the facility to confront Weyland, where he discovers he was also an android, before defeating it and successfully calling \\"Weyland's\\" dropship; getting himself, Tequila, and Katya off world. They are then seen in cryo-sleep while the pilot uploads the datapad's contents to an older-looking Weyland; who appears delighted to learn that a \\"live specimen\\" was secured and the coordinates to the Xenomorph homeworld was discovered. =Alien= As an Alien, the game begins in a laboratory, where two humans are being kept as prisoners. As they awake, Chestbursters erupt from their bodies; killing them. As scientists enter the room to collect the specimens, they find \\"Specimen 6\\" missing. The missing chestburster then emerges from the second victim's mouth, forcing head scientist Dr. Groves to gas the room; killing the other scientists and subduing the chestburster. However, Mr. Weyland prevents the creature's death, as he's impressed with its cunning, and tells Groves to transfer it to a special program; giving it the codename '6'. Days later, 6 is fully grown. During an observation of its abilities, Weyland opens the door to the ancient ruins built by the Predators' ancestors. In response, the structure emits an electromagnetic pulse that disables the local human colony's systems, including 6's restraints; allowing it to escape and release the other captive Xenomorphs and Matriarch. Once free, the Aliens retreat to the nearby refinery, where they establish a hive and go dormant until the Colonial Marines arrive. From there, 6 and the other Xenomorphs slaughter or harvest any humans they encounter before facing off with a group of Predators. 6 weakens the Elite leading them to be harvested and later give rise to a Predalien (seen in the Predator campaign). While returning to the Hive, 6 sees a debilitating vision of the Matriarch being killed in an explosion and goes into a hibernation state. It's found by combat androids led by Weyland, who takes pity on it and brings it back with him. Once on board the human's ship, 6 slaughters the crew and molts into a Praetorian; implying it'll eventually become the new queen. =Predator= As a Predator, the game starts in the jungles of an alien world, where a Youngblood proves himself worthy of being called an \\"Elite\\". Once the trials are complete, the young Predator, \\"Dark\\", is dispatched with a group in order to investigate a distress call sent by a youngblood hunting party on another planet (BG 386). On the planet, Dark locates the Youngbloods and sets their bracers to self-destruct before making trophies of the Marines for desecrating their sacred hunting grounds. Along the way, he obtains several new weapons to assist him, such as a smart disc and the combi-stick. While in the ruins, he finds the mask of an ancient and legendary Predator. Replacing his own with this mask, it plays back holographic images of the Predators' first victory over the Aliens. It is at this point that Dark is instructed to find the ancient Predator's wrist bracer. The Elite battles his way through a Weyland-Yutani research lab overrun with Xenomorphs and combat androids to acquire the bracer before venturing down to the Predators' pyramid to activate its self-destruct function. During the countdown, it battles and kills a Predalien (born from the Elite Predator in the Alien campaign) before narrowly escaping the resulting explosion. After escaping the temple, Dark returns to the Predator ship and his ancient mask gives him data revealing the Aliens' homeworld. Development In December 2008, a Kotaku article stated that Sega had announced that an Aliens vs. Predator video game was being developed. This meant that Sega's other then-upcoming game, Aliens: Colonial Marines, would be pushed back so Aliens vs. Predator could be released first. It was later confirmed that Lance Henriksen was involved as one of the characters of the game; he plays Karl Bishop Weyland. =Australian controversy= An early build of the game was submitted for review to the OFLC, but was denied classification in Australia in 2009 and effectively banned for sale altogether. Sega announced that there would not be a re-cut version released in Australia, and that it would appeal the decision. The game's refusal of classification again brought up the issue of a need for an R18+ rating in games, a move supported by many members of the public and government members. On December 18, 2009, Sega won the appeal on the classification of the game in Australia. \\"It is with great pleasure that we announce the success of our appeal,\\" says Darren Macbeth, managing director of Sega Australia. \\"We are particularly proud that the game will be released in its original entirety, with no content altered or removed whatsoever. Australian gamers applaud the Classification Review Board on making a decision that clearly considers the context of the game, and is in line with the modern expectations of reasonable Australians.\\" The Board noted that \\"the violence depicted in the game can be accommodated within the MA 15+ category as the violent scenes are not prolonged and are interspersed with longer non-violent sequences. The violence is fantastical in nature and justified by the context of the game, set in a futuristic science-fiction world, inhabited by aliens and predators. This context serves to lessen its impact. The more contentious violence is randomly generated and is not dependent on the player selection of specific moves.\\" Downloadable content Two additional map packs have been released for purchase via Steam, PlayStation Network and the Xbox Live Marketplace entitled Swarm and Bughunt. The Swarm Map Pack and Bughunt Map Pack were respectively released on March 19 and July 9, 2010. Both downloads provide new multiplayer maps and survivor maps. ReceptionCritical reception= Aliens vs. Predator received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Official Xbox Magazine UK praised the game for its \\"superb atmosphere\\" and \\"unique multiplayer\\", but criticized the odd melee system and how the marines could knock back an alien, relieving some of the atmosphere. The most scathing review came from 1UP, who found the multiplayer hard to recommend over the prior game in the series, Aliens versus Predator 2, describing it as \\"ultimately thin and awkward\\". GameZone's Dakota Grabowski said: \\"If the recent films on the Aliens vs. Predator franchise haven‚Äôt been painful enough to sit through, then perhaps video gamers worldwide are ready to stomach Sega and Rebellion‚Äôs pitiful offering. Delivering poor results and half-baked ideas, it‚Äôs my regret to call Aliens vs. Predator the year‚Äôs most disappointing title thus far.\\" 411Mania gave the PlayStation 3 version a score of 7.9 out of 10 and called it \\"a solid game with its fair share of problems. For fans of the franchise, you‚Äôll be able to look over the blemishes and find a game that you‚Äôll be playing for months.

Revolutionary War Hare was a regimental company captain in Butler's Rangers, a British provincial regiment composed of Loyalists, during the American Revolutionary war. Hare participated in the Wyoming Valley massacre of July 1778 and the Cherry Valley massacre in November of the same year.

They are located close to God's Window and the highest waterfall in South Africa's Mpumalanga province, Lisbon Falls. Whilst less than a tenth of the heigh of South Africa's tallest waterfall, the Tugela Falls, they are nonetheless extremely beautiful. Berlin Falls, which forms part of the Blyde River Canyon on the Panorama route, is one of several waterfalls that can be found in the Sabie region ‚Äì the others being Horseshoe Falls, Lone Creek Falls, Bridal Veil Falls, Mac-Mac Falls, and the highest waterfall in Mpumalanga, Lisbon Falls, which is a staggering 90m high. The Berlin Falls cascade from the centre of a sheer cliff that stands roughly 80m tall. The shape of the falls is likened to a giant candle. A narrow, natural channel at the top of the falls creates the ‚Äòwick‚Äô of the candle, and as the water drops from this point, it fans out creating the rest of the candle before emptying out into the pool below. Berlin Falls gets its name from miners who ventured to South Africa from Europe during the gold rush, and named each waterfall in the region after their home towns, or places from their home countries. Visitors to the Berlin Falls can explore the area by foot, enjoy a picnic around the waterfall, and even take a dip in the pool at the base of the waterfall. Be sure to look out for the Blyde River Protea which is endemic to this area. Birding enthusiasts will also enjoy the numerous bird species which can be found in this region of the Mpumalanga escarpment. Binoculars and bird identification books are highly recommended. The falls are on the Sabine River and fall , dumping into a circular basin flanked by red cliffs. The falls have the shape of a candle, with the first short drop the wick, and the remaining, broader drop being the candle body.  Etymology  The falls were named by German miners during the gold rush, who named locations after towns and places in their home country. Berlin Falls was named for the capital of Germany.

It is currently used as a district office by state senator Sue Serino.  Description and history  Built before the Revolutionary War, it is one of only two remaining Dutch Colonial stone houses in Hyde Park. It is a five-by-two-bay one-story building with a slate-covered gambrel roof pierced by two brick chimneys at the gable ends. It is sided in uncoursed fieldstone, with clapboard on the gable ends. Two small frame wings project from the north and east (rear). An arched doorway on the south leads to the cellar. The main entrance has a flat-roofed wooden portico. John Bergh inherited the lands from his father Christian in the years before the Revolution, along with his brother-in-law Martin Dop. Both of them built houses on them sometime between 1771 and 1780, as they appear on a map of the Albany Post Road (later to become Route 9 through Hyde Park) drawn by Robert Erskine, Surveyor-General of the Continental Army, in the last years of his life, between 1778 and 1780. In 1788 Bergh sold a hundred acres (40 ha) to Jacobus Stoutenburgh II. His daughter Margaret, in turn, eventually inherited the property. It remained in use as a house throughout the 19th century and into much of the 20th. It was still a residence when it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, the first property in Hyde Park listed on the Register in its own right.The Home of Franklin D.

Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Parratt played quarterback for the Shelby Blues, Lorain Pros, Massillon Tigers, Massillon All-Stars, Franklin Athletic Club of Cleveland, Akron Indians and the Cleveland Tigers between 1905 and 1916. Parratt threw the first legal forward pass in professional football history while playing for the Massillon Tigers on October 25, 1906. College career Parratt played college football at Case School of Applied Science, now known as Case Western Reserve University. During his time at Case, he became a 3-time All-Ohio college star. However, in 1905, he risked his amateur standing by playing professional ball on Sundays for the Shelby Blues. To hide his identity from the media and school officials, Parratt played under the name \\"Jimmy Murphy\\" and used a nose guard to conceal his face. However just weeks after his first game for Shelby, the Cleveland newspapers revealed that \\"Murphy\\" was really Peggy Parratt, in disguise. Soon afterwards Parratt was called in for questioning by the chairman of the Case University Athletic Board, Professor Arthur S. Wright. During the interview, Parratt openly admitted to breaking the amateur code. He was then barred from all further intercollegiate play at Case. At this time, Parratt was also a star basketball and baseball player for Case and was removed from those teams as well. By admitting openly to playing for Shelby, Parratt thus became the first college football star to be disciplined by his school for moonlighting as a professional football player. Several other college players had secretly played professional football, but they always denied the charges when questioned. However Case still awarded Peggy his varsity letter, citing his invaluable leadership on and off the field during the major part of the 1905 football season. He also made All-Ohio Honors for 1905 and was allowed to coach the college's baseball team, after being stripped of captaincy due to the scandal. After graduating from Case in 1906, Parratt was offered the head football coaching job at Marietta College, however he turned it down to continue his professional playing career. In 1909, however, Peggy was an assistant football coach at Case, while he was also playing for the Shelby Blues. Professional careerMassillon Tigers= After losing his amateur status, Parratt played football for the Lorain Pros for the remainder of the 1905 season. In 1906, Peggy was signed by the Massillon Tigers, in part because of his mastery of the forward pass. He immediately earned the role of starting quarterback. The first forward pass in a professional football game may have been thrown by Parratt on October 25, 1906 to Dan \\"Bullet\\" Riley in a victory over a combined Benwood-Moundsville team, according to Robert W. Peterson in his book Pigskin The Early Years of Pro Football. Parratt though did not receive initial recognition for the pass since Eddie Wood of the Canton Bulldogs and Latrobe Athletic Association was erroneously credited for catching the first forward pass in pro football by Harry March in his book Pro Football: Its Ups and Downs. During the second game of the 1906 Ohio League championship, which would later result in a betting scandal on November 24, 1906, Wood reportedly caught a couple of the new forward passes. March somehow stated that those catches in a championship game, at the end of the season, were very first catches in professional football. It was later discovered that Parratt threw an earlier recorded pass to Bullet Riley on October 25, for professional football's first forward pass. A second recorded pass was thrown to Clark Schrontz two days later.* During the Tigers season-ending series with the Canton Bulldogs, to determine the Ohio League champions, Parratt caught two interceptions while the Tigers won the series second, and deciding game. However rumors of a betting fix tainted the championship and turned the public off to pro football in Ohio for the next several years. Many of the top players of the day left Ohio when the scandal broke. This left only the local sandlotters to pick up the pieces and try to patch together a respectable season for 1907. Since Parratt was not a part of the scandal, he continued to play for Massillon, now renamed the \\"Massillon All-Stars\\" for 1907, however he soon learned that he could make more money playing with the Franklin Athletic Club, which was untouched by the fallout over the betting scandal the year before. =Franklin Athletic Club= During his year with the Franklin A.C., Parratt played in only a few games. He spent the majority of his time, officiating professional football games in the Cleveland-area. =Shelby Blues= Sometime before the 1908 season, Parratt returned to the Shelby Blues, the place where he made his professional debut in 1905. He became the owner of the franchise by helping to organize and financially back the team. He also became a player-coach for the Blues and helped the team recruit players. In his first year with the Blues, the team defeated all of their rivals and finished in a tie with the Akron Indians for state honors. However, in 1909, the Indians defeated the Blues 13-9 and claimed the championship. For the 1910 season, Parratt decided to recruit heavily to put together a contender in Shelby. As a result, Peggy signed several well-known Ohio college graduates and combined them with the best local veteran players he could find. The plan worked and Shelby upset the Indians twice, 16-6 and 8-5, and the Blues claimed the 1910 Ohio title. 1911 Ohio League title forfeit Parratt used the same plan for the upcoming 1911 season and once again Shelby defeated Akron twice, 6-0 and 3-0. The 1911 title game was then to be between the Blues and the revived Canton Bulldogs, then referred to as the Canton Professionals. The Blues won the game when Canton forfeited the title game to Shelby, after a heated dispute over an offside ruling. According to reports, Parratt was willing to compromise with Canton over the official's call, however Canton captain Harry Turner was so upset that he called his team off the field and refused to continue the game. Immediately after the game, Turner vowed to give up football because of the call. However Turner wanted so badly to beat Parratt that he returned to play for Canton for the next three years. =Akron Indians= Before the 1912 season, Parratt left Shelby for Akron. He took the move realizing that he could make more money in the larger football market that Akron could provide. When he arrived in Akron, his first move was to change the team name from the \\"Akron\\" Indians to \\"Parratt's\\" Indians. With Peggy as player, coach, and owner-manager, the Indians split their series with Shelby and twice defeated Canton, 14-7 and 19-7. However, they were defeated by the unheard of Elyria Athletics, who then took the Ohio championship. The Athletics were mostly former Blues players who formed a team in Elyria after Parratt left for Akron. The following season, Peggy brought most of Elyria's 1912 championship team to Akron, and adding them to his roster. The Indians then beat Shelby and Elyria. They also managed to tie the rapidly improving Canton Pros. During Indians championship game against Shelby, the Blues loaded their team with a collection of famous players from big Eastern schools and supported each member with a payroll of $700 for just that one game. However, the game was cancelled due to snowstorm. A week later when the Blues returned to Akron, the Indians were prepared with newly recruited talent that was viewed as even superior to that of Shelbys. The Indians won the game 20-0 and brought the Ohio title back to Akron. The death of Harry Turner For his 1914 recruiting efforts, Parratt signed the usual big names players, which consisted of a lineup that changed from week to week, with just enough stars on hand to guarantee a win. However, in 1914, he also employed several former Notre Dame stars, including the legendary Knute Rockne, Howard \\"Horse\\" Edwards, \\"Deke\\" Jones, and Joe Collins. As well as several Ohio collegiate stars like Ed Kagy, Dwight Wertz, Homer Davidson, Dutch Powell, Frank Nesser and Ralph \\"Fat\\" Waldsmith. By late season, the entire left side of his Akron Indian line was from Notre Dame. The team dominated the Ohio League for the season, however they managed to lose to Canton 6-0 on November 15, 1914. That game was memorable not because of Canton's win, but because Harry Turner, who had fostered a need to beat Parratt at football, died when his spine broke during a tackle on Akron's fullback, Joe Collins. Turner's death marked the first fatal accident involving a major professional football team in Ohio. According to Canton manager Jack Cusack, Turner on his deathbed whispered, \\"I know I must go, but I'm satisfied, for we beat Peggy Parratt!\\" A week later Akron defeated a mourning Canton team 21-0 to claim the 1914 title. =Cleveland Tigers= To avoid an Akron title in 1915 the owners of the Massillon Tigers raided Parratt's Akron roster and took away many of his star players.* Canton manager, Jack Cusack, also picked up some former Akron players and signed Jim Thorpe to his renamed Canton Bulldogs team. By the end of the season, Parratt's team was made up mostly of Akron sandlotters. After the disastrous 1915 season, Parratt returned to Cleveland, where he took some of his former Akron players and a few ex-collegians into a respectable team which he named the Cleveland Tigers. The 1916 Tigers compiled a winning record despite falling to the Bulldogs and splitting a two-game series with the Columbus Panhandles. Parratt played his last professional football game on October 22, 1916, as his Tigers lost to Columbus 9-6. Formation of the NFL After his retirement from football, Parratt's name was always brought up when anyone tried to establish a concrete football league. Peggy was not part of the 1920 meetings set-up by Ralph Hay which saw the birth of the National Football League. He did reappear on the football scene on August 1, 1925, in Chicago, representing Cleveland Tigers owner Samuel Deutsch. A few months later on February 6, 1926, Parratt was appointed to two of the NFL's most important committees. The first committee consisted of a seven-member panel that was charged with redrafting the NFL constitution and by-laws. The second committee was a three-man committee to meet with the Intercollegiate Committee of Athletics (ICA) in New York City. The other two members of this panel were George Halas and Dr. Harry March. Bridge player After his football-playing days, he achieved some notability at tournaments in the later days of auction and the early days of contract bridge.

He perjured himself on numerous occasions, giving false testimony which led to the conviction and execution of numerous innocent men, notably the Catholic nobleman Lord Stafford, the Jesuit Provincial Thomas Whitbread, and the prominent barrister Richard Langhorne. Life Lords Aston of Forfar, Dugdale's employers. Dugdale's early life is obscure, but he was probably a native of Staffordshire, and is said to have belonged to a family of minor gentry, although little seems to be known about his parents. The favourable impression he made on the authorities during the Plot indicates that he was well educated and of good social standing. He became a Roman Catholic convert in 1657 or 1658 (being at that date about eighteen years of age). About the same time he met Francis Evers (or Eure), a leading Jesuit, in Staffordshire: Evers later figured in his fabricated story as one of the masterminds of the Popish Plot. In 1677 Dugdale was steward to the wealthy Catholic nobleman Walter Aston, 2nd Lord Aston of Forfar, at his principal residence Tixall, Staffordshire, where he cheated the workmen of their wages. In July or August, according to Dugdale, letters arrived at Tixall connected with the Popish Plot, in which the Jesuits and several Catholic lords were said to be deeply implicated. Dugdale claimed that meetings between the conspirators at Tixall followed in August and September 1678, and that the murder of Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey was discussed. By September Dugdale found himself about to be dismissed for embezzlement (he had stolen money to cover his gambling debts) and general misconduct by Walter Aston, 3rd Lord Aston of Forfar, who had just succeeded to his father's title. Dugdale turned on his employer, who in the prevailing public mood was extremely vulnerable to false charges of treason, as the Aston family were not only open Roman Catholics but the effective leaders of the Staffordshire Catholic community. The elder Lord Aston had been accused of recusancy in 1675, though the charges against him were quickly dropped. Popish Plot Dugdale gave evidence before the justices of the peace, who issued warrants for the apprehension of George Hobson and George North. Although he professed to have broken open letters from Paris to Evers and others, he had little but hearsay evidence, and pretended to have destroyed the most dangerous documents on the eve of his departure. His evidence was further weakened by the inability of the authorities to find Francis Evers, who remained free throughout the Plot. He gave evidence against the \\"five popish lords\\" (Lord Stafford, Earl of Powis, Lord Arundell of Wardour, Lord Belasyse and Lord Petre) in October 1678. On 24 December 1678 he swore an information before two magistrates, Thomas Lane and J. Vernon in Staffordshire. His initial reception by the Government was extremely favourable : he was \\"a man of sense and temper\\", intelligent, educated and well-spoken, in marked contrast to the disreputable earlier informers like Titus Oates. His testimony, in the early stages, was so plausible that even Charles II, who had previously been a complete sceptic on the subject, \\"began to think there was somewhat in the Plot\\";Kenyon, J.P. The Popish Plot Phoenix Press reissue 2000 p.158 while Chief Justice William Scroggs found him entirely convincing, as did many others, for \\"somewhat in his air disposed people to believe him\\". By the time his unsavoury past came to light he had done a great deal of harm. Despite his deep sense of grievance against Lord Aston he seemed at first rather hesitant about actually accusing him of complicity in the Plot, but eventually did so: Aston was accordingly sent to the Tower of London.Kenyon p.162 Francis Barlow. Dugdale charged John Tasborough and Mrs. Ann Price with soliciting him to sign a paper of recantation of his evidence, and offering him a ¬£1,000 reward for it. In February 1679 these persons were tried and convicted at the king's bench; Price had been Dugdale's fellow-servant and sweetheart at Tixall. Afterwards Dugdale led a shifty, vagabond life, giving evidence and writing pamphlets, at first associating chiefly with William Bedloe, Oates, and Edward Turberville, but eventually turning against Stephen College and confronting Oates. The Plot Trials At the trial of the five Jesuits (Thomas Whitebread, William Barrow alias Harcourt, John Fenwick, John Gavan, and Anthony Turner, from 13 June 1679) Dugdale charged two of them with consulting to bring about the assassination of Charles II. He charged Whitebread with writing a letter providing for the entertainment of 'good stout fellows,' namely the four Irish 'ruffians' who were reported to be have been hired for the regicide. Next day, 14 June, at the trial of the barrister Richard Langhorn, Dugdale was a chief witness for the prosecution. All six men were found guilty and executed, although they were spared the usual horrors of a traitor's death: the King (who was convinced of their innocence) as an act of clemency ordered that they not be hung drawn and quartered, but allowed to hang until they were dead. At the trial of Sir George Wakeman, from 18 July, Dugdale gave evidence against the accused ; but he was already falling into discredit (his claim that all Protestants in England were to be massacred if the Plot succeeded was too much even for Lord Chief Justice Scroggs to swallow) and an acquittal followed. He swore, on the second day of Lord Stafford's trial, 1 December 1680, that the accused had been present at the \\"consults\\" at Tixall in September 1678, and also at Abnett's house in Stafford, where there had been talk about slaying the king, and that on the 20th or 21st Stafford offered him ¬£500 to commit the crime. The prolonged dispute at the trial was chiefly concerning dates. But it came to light that Dugdale had tried to bribe other persons to give false evidence against Stafford and other persons. Nonetheless the evidence of Dugdale, Oates and Turberville was sufficient to secure the conviction and death of Stafford, who was beheaded on 29 December 1680. As the public gradually became more sceptical about the reality of the plot, Lord Aston, who had accidentally launched Dugdale's career as an informer by dismissing him, was able to gain his freedom on bail. Aston never returned to prison, and never stood trial.Kenyon p.256 After the Plot Dugdale was understood to be willing to appear as a witness against the Whig leader Shaftesbury, who had undoubtedly used the Plot for his own political ends, and was seen by the King as his principal opponent. As a first step in bringing down Shaftesbury, Dugdale gave evidence against his fellow informer Stephen College at the Old Bailey, when a verdict of Ignoramus (i.e. we find no case against the accused) was returned by the grand jury, 8 July 1681. At the later trial at Oxford of College (the Crown having simply ignored the grand jury's finding that he had no case to answer), Dugdale swore against him, but came into direct conflict with his old associates like Titus Oates. In October Dugdale vainly complained to the council of Dr. Richard Lower, who stated that he had treated him for an infamous disease, Dugdale having sworn at College's trial that his previous illness had been caused solely by the Catholics having tried to poison him. Lower and the apothecary proved the case, and the council dismissed the false witness \\"not to trouble them any more\\". Dugdale then caused a Captain Clinton to be apprehended, 28 December 1681, for defaming him, but the council set Clinton at liberty on bail. Death Dugdale died a day or two before 26 March 1683. cites Luttrell, i. 253.

Since its independence, Uruguay had been ravaged by intermittent struggles between the Colorado and Blanco factions, each attempting to seize and maintain power in turn. The Colorado leader Venancio Flores launched the Liberating Crusade in 1863, an insurrection aimed at toppling Bernardo Berro, who presided over a Colorado‚ÄìBlanco coalition (fusionist) government. Flores was aided by Argentina, whose president Bartolom√© Mitre provided him with supplies, Argentine volunteers and river transport for troops. The fusionism movement collapsed as the Colorados abandoned the coalition to join Flores' ranks. The Uruguayan Civil War quickly escalated, developing into a crisis of international scope that destabilized the entire region. Even before the Colorado rebellion, the Blancos within fusionism had sought an alliance with Paraguayan dictator Francisco Solano L√≥pez. Berro's now purely Blanco government also received support from Argentine federalists, who opposed Mitre and his Unitarians. The situation deteriorated as the Empire of Brazil was drawn into the conflict. Almost one fifth of the Uruguayan population were considered Brazilian. Some joined Flores' rebellion, spurred by discontent with Blanco government policies that they regarded as harmful to their interests. Brazil eventually decided to intervene in the Uruguayan affair to reestablish the security of its southern frontiers and its regional ascendancy. In April 1864, Brazil sent Minister Plenipotentiary Jos√© Ant√¥nio Saraiva to negotiate with Atanasio Aguirre, who had succeeded Berro in Uruguay. Saraiva made an initial attempt to settle the dispute between Blancos and Colorados. Faced with Aguirre's intransigence regarding Flores' demands, the Brazilian diplomat abandoned the effort and sided with the Colorados. On 10 August 1864, after a Brazilian ultimatum was refused, Saraiva declared that Brazil's military would begin exacting reprisals. Brazil declined to acknowledge a formal state of war, and for most of its duration, the Uruguayan‚ÄìBrazilian armed conflict was an undeclared war. In a combined offensive against Blanco strongholds, the Brazilian‚ÄìColorado troops advanced through Uruguayan territory, taking one town after another. Eventually the Blancos were left isolated in Montevideo, the national capital. Faced with certain defeat, the Blanco government capitulated on 20 February 1865. The short-lived war would have been regarded as an outstanding success for Brazilian and Argentine interests, had Paraguayan intervention in support of the Blancos (with attacks upon Brazilian and Argentine provinces) not led to the long and costly Paraguayan War. Uruguayan Civil WarBlanco‚ÄìColorado strife= Platine region in 1864. The shaded areas are disputed territories. The Oriental Republic of Uruguay in South America had been, since its independence in 1828, troubled by strife between the Blanco Party and the Colorado Party. They were not political parties in the modern sense, but factions that engaged in internecine rebellion whenever the other dominated the government. The nation was deeply divided into Colorado and Blanco camps. These partisan groups formed in the 1830s and arose out of patron‚Äìclient relationships fostered by local caudillos in the cities and countryside. Rather than a unity based upon common nationalistic sentiments, each had differing aims and loyalties informed by their respective, insular political frameworks. Uruguay had a very low population density and a weak government. Ordinary citizens were compelled by circumstances to seek the protection of local caudillos‚Äîlandlords who were either Colorados or Blancos and who used their workers, mostly gaucho horsemen, as private armies. The civil wars between the two factions were brutal. Harsh tactics produced ever-increasing alienation between the groups, and included seizure of land, confiscation of livestock and executions. The antagonism caused by atrocities, along with family loyalties and political ties, made reconciliation unthinkable. European immigrants, who came in great numbers during the latter half of the nineteenth century, were drawn into one party or the other; both parties had liberal and conservative wings, so the social and political views of newcomers could be reconciled with either. The feuding blocs impeded development of a broadly supported central national administration. =Liberating Crusade of 1863= Gaucho horsemen were used as militiamen by caudillos of the Platine region In the latter half of the 1850s, leading members of the Colorados and Blancos attempted a reconciliation. With the approval of many from both parties efforts were made to implement \\"fusionist\\" policies, which began to show results in cooperation in government and military spheres. The attempt at healing the schism was dealt a setback in 1858 when reactionaries in the Colorado Party rejected the scheme. The revolt was put down by Gabriel Pereira, a former Colorado and Uruguayan president under the fusionist government. The rebellious leaders were executed at Paso de Quinteros along the R√≠o Negro, sparking renewed conflict. The Colorados suspected fusionism of promoting Blanco aims to their own detriment and called for the \\"martyrs of Quinteros\\" to be avenged. With the internal weaknesses of fusionism now exposed, the Colorados moved to oust its supporters from the government. Their leader, Brigadier General Venancio Flores, a caudillo and an early proponent of fusionism, found himself without sufficient military resources to mount a sustained revolt and resorted to asking for intervention by Argentina. Argentina was a fragmented nation (since the 1852 downfall of Argentine dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas), with the Argentine Confederation and the State of Buenos Aires each vying for supremacy.See: * ; * ; * . Flores approached the Buenos Aires Minister of War, Bartolom√© Mitre, agreeing to throw the support of the Colorados behind Buenos Aires in exchange for subsequent Argentine assistance in their fight against the fusionist government in Montevideo (the Uruguayan capital). Flores and his Colorado units served Buenos Aires with fierce determination. They played a decisive role in the Battle of Pav√≥n on 17 September 1861, in which the Confederation was defeated and all Argentina was reunited under the government in Buenos Aires. In fulfillment of his commitment, Mitre arranged for the Colorado militia, Argentine volunteer units and supplies to be carried aboard Argentine vessels to Uruguay in May and June 1863. Ships of the Argentine navy kept Uruguayan gunships away from the operation. Back on his native soil, Flores called for the ouster of the constitutional government, by that time headed by Bernardo Berro. Flores accused the Montevideo government of Blanco sympathies and framed his \\"Liberating Crusade\\" (as he called his rebellion) in the familiar terms of a Colorado vs. Blanco struggle. Colorados from rural areas joined defectors from the military in responding to his call.See: * ; * ; * ; * . International crisisParaguayan‚ÄìBlanco ties= Buenos Aires, capital of Argentina, 1864 Although the Colorados had defected to the Flores insurgency, the national guard continued to support the fusionist government. Blanco partisans filled its depleted ranks. They also replaced army officers who had deserted to Flores. The Blancos received aid from several Argentine Federalists who joined their cause. As in Uruguay, Argentina had long been a battleground of rival parties, and Bartolom√© Mitre's victory at Pav√≥n in 1861 had signaled the triumph of his Unitarian Party over the Federal Party led by Justo Jos√© de Urquiza. Mitre denied any involvement in the Flores rebellion, even though his complicity was widely known and taken for granted.See: * ; * ; * . Relations between Argentina and Uruguay worsened, and both nations came close to declaring war on each other, although neither could afford a direct military conflict. Argentina had only recently emerged from a long civil war, and was still struggling to suppress a Federalist rebellion in its western province of La Rioja. Uruguay was too weak militarily to engage in a fight unaided. Since 1862, the Blancos had made repeated overtures to Paraguay, governed by dictator Carlos Antonio L√≥pez, in an attempt to forge an alliance that might advance both their interests in the Platine region. Upon the death of L√≥pez, his son, Francisco Solano L√≥pez, succeeded him as Paraguayan dictator. Unlike the elder L√≥pez, who strove to avoid encumbering alliances, Solano greeted the Blancos' proposal with enthusiasm. He believed Argentina was working towards the annexation of both Uruguay and Paraguay, with the goal of recreating the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata, the former Spanish colony that once encompassed the territories of all three nations. Solano L√≥pez had, as far back as 1855, expressed this concern, commenting to the Uruguayan Andr√©s Lamas that \\"the idea of reconstructing [the old viceroyalty] is in the soul of the Argentines; and as a result, it isn't just Paraguay that needs to stand guard: your country, the Oriental Republic [of Uruguay], needs to get along with my own in order to prepare for any eventualities.\\" In late 1863, Solano L√≥pez was mobilizing his army and was in talks with Urquiza, the leader of the dissident Argentine Federalists, to convince him to join the proposed Paraguayan‚ÄìUruguayan alliance. =Brazil and the civil war= Rio de Janeiro, capital of the Empire of Brazil, c. 1865 The developments in Uruguay were closely watched by the Empire of Brazil, which had vital interests in the R√≠o de la Plata Basin. After Rosas fell in 1852, Brazil became the dominant regional power. Its foreign policy included the covert underwriting of opposition parties in Uruguay and Argentina, preventing strong governments that might threaten Brazil's strategic position in the area. Brazilian banking and commercial firms also had ventures in the area, furthering ties within the region. In Uruguay, the bank run by Irineu Evangelista de Sousa (Baron and later Viscount of Mau√°) became so heavily involved in commercial enterprises that the economy depended on this source of continued capital flow. About 18 percent (40,000) of the Uruguayan population (220,000) spoke Portuguese and regarded themselves as Brazilian rather than Uruguayan. Many within Flores' ranks were Brazilians, some hailing from the nearby Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul. Life along the frontier between Rio Grande do Sul and Uruguay was often chaotic, with hostilities erupting between partisans of various cattle barons, cattle-rustling and random killings. Large landowners on both sides of the border had long been antagonistic toward Berro's policies.See: * ; * ; * ; * . The Uruguayan president attempted to tax the cattle coming from Rio Grande do Sul and to impose curbs on the use of Brazilian slaves within Uruguayan territory; slavery had been outlawed years before in Uruguay.See: * ; * ; * ; * . Among the Brazilian land barons were David Canabarro and Ant√¥nio de Sousa Neto, both allies of Flores and former separatist rebels during the Ragamuffin War that had ravaged Rio Grande do Sul from 1835 until 1845. Canabarro, a frontier military commander, misled Brazil's government by denying that Brazilians were crossing the border to join Flores. Sousa Neto went to the Brazilian capital to request immediate government intervention in Uruguay, claiming that Brazilians were being murdered and their ranches robbed.See: * ; * ; * . The \\"fact that Uruguayan citizens had just as valid claims against Brazil as Brazilians had against Uruguay was ignored\\", said historian Philip Raine. Although Sousa Neto had ties with the governing political party, his claims, including that he could amass a force of 40,000 to invade Uruguay, were not taken seriously by all. The Uruguayan crisis arrived at a difficult moment for Brazil, which was on the verge of a full- blown war with the British Empire for unrelated reasons. Brazil's government decided to intervene in Uruguay, fearful of showing any weakness in the face of an impending conflict with Britain, and believing that it would be better for the central government to take the lead rather than allow the Brazilian ranchers on the frontier to decide the course of events.See: * ; * ; * . Early engagementsBrazilian ultimatum= steam frigate Amazonas served as part of the Brazilian naval fleet during the war. On 1 March 1864, Berro's term of office ended. The ongoing civil war prevented elections; therefore Atanasio Aguirre, president of the Uruguayan senate and a member of the Amapolas (the radical wing of the Blanco Party) replaced Berro, on an interim basis. In April, Jos√© Ant√¥nio Saraiva was appointed minister plenipotentiary by the Brazilian government and charged with quickly reaching an accord that would settle Brazil's claims and ensure the safety of Brazilian citizens. His focus soon shifted from satisfying Brazil's terms to a more immediate goal of hammering out a deal between the antagonists in the civil war, with the expectation that only a more stable regime would be able to reach a settlement with Brazil. The government in Montevideo was at first reluctant to consider Saraiva's proposals. With backing from Paraguay, it saw little advantage in negotiating a close to the civil war or in seeking to comply with Brazil's demands. The main factor, as historian Jeffrey D. Needell summarized, was that the \\"Uruguayan president had been unwilling to resolve these, particularly because the Brazilians whose grievances were at issue were allies of Venancio Flores, a client of the Argentines, and a man who was seeking his overthrow.\\" A mutual enmity between Brazil and its Hispanic- American neighbors compounded the difficulties, the result of a long-standing distrust and rivalry between Spain and Portugal that had been carried over to their former American colonies. Brazil and Uruguay exhibited loathing for one another; as Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham put it: \\"the Brazilians holding the Uruguayans as bloodthirsty savages, and the Uruguayans returning their contempt for the unwarlike ways of the Brazilians, whom they called monkeys, and looked down upon, for their mixed blood.\\" Eventually, in July 1864, Saraiva's persistent diplomacy moved the Uruguayan government to agree to mediated talks including Edward Thornton (the British resident minister in Buenos Aires), Argentine foreign minister Rufino de Elizalde and Saraiva himself.See: * ; * ; * . Initially, the negotiations seemed promising, but soon bogged down. On 4 August, convinced that the government in Montevideo was unwilling to work toward a settlement, a frustrated Saraiva delivered an ultimatum, which the Uruguayans rebuffed. On 10 August, Saraiva informed Aguirre that the Brazilian military commanders would receive orders to begin retaliation, marking the beginning of the war.See: * ; * ; * . =Alliance with rebel Colorados= The Uruguayan steamship Villa del Salto after it ran aground and was set on fire by its crew Under the orders of Vice-Admiral Joaquim Marques Lisboa (Baron of Tamandar√©), a Brazilian fleet was stationed in Uruguayan territorial waters. The naval force comprised twelve steamships: one frigate, six corvettes and five gunboats. On 11 August 1864, Tamandar√©, as the commander-in-chief of Brazilian naval and land forces in the war, received orders from Saraiva to begin retaliatory operations. Brazilian warships were deployed to the Uruguayan towns of Salto, Paysand√∫ and Maldonado, ostensibly to \\"protect Brazilian subjects\\", while Uruguay's only warships, the small steamers Villa del Salto and General Artigas, were to be neutralized. When Tamandar√© demanded these steamships remain at their docks, only the crew of General Artigas complied.See: * ; * ; * ; * . Tamandar√© created a naval command assigned to Captain of Sea and War Francisco Pereira Pinto (later Baron of Ivinhema). Consisting of two corvettes and one gunboat, the division was sent to patrol the Uruguay River, a tributary of the R√≠o de la Plata and part of the Platine region. On 24 August, Pereira Pinto sighted the Villa del Salto, which was conveying troops to fight the Colorados. The Villa del Salto ignored warning shots and a demand to surrender; after a desperate run from the Brazilian warships, it escaped to Argentine waters.See: * ; * ; * ; * . This first skirmish of the war prompted the Uruguayan government to sever all diplomatic ties with Brazil on 30 August. On 7 September, Pereira Pinto again encountered the Villa del Salto sailing from Salto to Paysand√∫. The two Brazilian corvettes attacked the Uruguayan ship as it again tried to escape to Argentina. The battle ended when the Villa del Salto ran aground near Paysand√∫, where its crew set it on fire to prevent it falling into Brazilian hands.See: * ; * ; * . Meanwhile, the General Artigas had been sold to prevent its capture by the Brazilians. To Flores, Brazil's military operations against the Blanco government represented a priceless opportunity, since he had been unable to achieve any lasting results during the rebellion. He entered talks with Saraiva, winning the Brazilian government over, after promising to settle their claims refused by the Blanco government. The Brazilian plenipotentiary minister gave instructions to Tamandar√© to form a joint offensive with the Colorado leader and overthrow the Blancos. On 20 October, after a swift exchange of letters, Flores and the Brazilian vice-admiral formed a secret alliance.See: * ; * ; * ; * . Colorado‚ÄìBrazil joint offensiveSieges of Uruguayan towns= Civilians departing Paysand√∫ during the siege, 1864 The Brazilian naval fleet in Uruguay was supposed to work in conjunction with a Brazilian land force. But months passed, and the \\"Army of the South\\" (called the \\"Division of Observation\\" until the ultimatum) stationed in Pira√≠ Grande (in Rio Grande do Sul) was still not ready to cross into Uruguayan territory. Its main objectives were to occupy the Uruguayan towns of Paysand√∫, Salto and Melo; once taken, they were to be handed over to Flores and his Colorados.See: * ; * ; * . On 12 October, a brigade led by Brigadier Jos√© Lu√≠s Mena Barreto detached from the main army. Two days later, near the Brazilian town of Jaguar√£o, the force invaded Uruguay's Cerro Largo Department. After skirmishes failed to halt their march, the Blancos abandoned Melo, and the brigade entered this capital of Cerro Largo unopposed, on 16 October. After handing over control of Melo to the Uruguayan Colorados, the Brazilians withdrew on 24 October, to rejoin their Army of the South.See: * ; * ; * ; * ; * . The next Brazilian target was Salto. Pereira Pinto sent two gunboats under First Lieutenant Joaquim Jos√© Pinto to blockade the town. On 24 November, Flores arrived with his troops and began the siege. Colonel Jos√© Palomeque, commander of the Uruguayan garrison, surrendered almost without firing a shot, on the afternoon of 28 November.See: * ; * ; * ; * ; * . Flores' army captured and incorporated four artillery pieces and 250 men; 300 Colorados and 150 Brazilians were left behind to occupy Salto. Paysand√∫, the last Brazilian target, was already under blockade by Pereira Pinto. Tamandar√©, who had been in Buenos Aires until this point, took charge of the blockade on 3 December. It was enforced by one corvette and four gunboats. Paysand√∫ was garrisoned by 1,274 men and 15 cannons, under the command of Colonel Leandro G√≥mez.See: * ; * ; * . Flores, who had come from Salto, headed a force of 3,000 men, mostly cavalry. He invested Paysand√∫, deploying 800 infantrymen, 7 cannons (3 of which were rifled), and detachments of an additional 660 Brazilians.See: * ; * ; * . G√≥mez declined the offer to surrender. From 6 December until 8 December, the Brazilians and Colorados made attempts to storm the town, advancing through the streets, but were unable to take it.See: * ; * ; * . Tamandar√© and Flores opted to wait for the arrival of the Army of the South. Meanwhile, Aguirre had sent General Juan S√°a with 3,000 men and four cannons to relieve the besieged town, forcing the Brazilians and Colorados to briefly lift the siege while dealing with this new threat. S√°a abandoned his advance before encountering the enemy force, and fled north of the R√≠o Negro.See: * ; * ; * ; * . =Army of the South in Paysand√∫= Brazilian navy and army troops during the siege of Paysand√∫, 1865 Rather than the show of force that had been intended by the Brazilian government, the war revealed the Empire's lack of military readiness. The Army of the South, stationed in Pira√≠ Grande, was commanded by Field Marshal Jo√£o Prop√≠cio Mena Barreto (later Baron of S√£o Gabriel) with two divisions. The 1st Division, under Brigadier Manuel Lu√≠s Os√≥rio (later Marquis of Erval), was formed by regular army units. The 2nd Division, under Brigadier Jos√© Lu√≠s Mena Barreto (who had since returned from his attack on Melo), was composed entirely of national guardsmen. Altogether, it numbered only 5,711 men‚Äîall (except some officers) native to Rio Grande do Sul. The army was poorly equipped for siege operations: it brought along no engineers (who could direct the construction of trenches); it was under- equipped, lacking even hatchets (necessary to cut fences, break through doors and scale walls); and its 12 cannons (a mix of La Hitte and Paixhans) were of small calibers ill-suited to attacking fortifications. On 1 December, almost four months after Saraiva presented the ultimatum, the Army of the South invaded Uruguay. Its troops were accompanied by a semi-independent militia unit, consisting of no more than 1,300 Brazilian gaucho cavalrymen, under the former Ragamuffin Ant√¥nio de Sousa Neto.See: * ; * ; * . The 7,011-strong force (with 200 supply carts) marched through Uruguayan territory unopposed, heading toward Paysand√∫ in the southwest. The disorganized and undisciplined bands of gauchos, who formed the armies of both Blancos and Colorados, were no match for the Brazilian troops. The Uruguayan gauchos \\"had combat experience but no training and were poorly armed save for the usual muskets, boleadoras, and fac√≥n knives\\", remarked historian Thomas L. Whigham. \\"Fire arms he [the Uruguayan gaucho] rarely possessed\\", said Cunninghame Graham, \\"or if by chance he owned a pair of long brass-mounted pistols or a flintlock blunderbuss, they were in general out of order and unserviceable. Upon the other hand, a little training made him a formidable adversary with the sabre and the lance.\\" Field Marshal Jo√£o Prop√≠cio Mena Barreto reached Paysand√∫ on 29 December with two infantry brigades and one artillery regiment under Lieutenant Colonel √âmile Louis Mallet (later Baron of Itapevi). The Army of the South's cavalry established its camp a few kilometers away. Meanwhile, G√≥mez beheaded forty Colorados and fifteen Brazilian prisoners and \\"hung their still-dripping heads above his trenches in full view of their compatriots.\\" On 31 December, the Brazilians and Colorados recommenced their attack and overran the city's defenses, after a bitter struggle, on 2 January 1865. The Brazilians captured G√≥mez and handed him over to the Colorados. Colonel Gregorio \\"Goyo\\" Su√°rez shot G√≥mez and three of his officers. According to Whigham, \\"Su√°rez's actions were not really unexpected, as several members of his immediate family had fallen victim to G√≥mez's wrath against the Colorados.\\" Blanco capitulationFurther operations= The route taken by the Army of the South during the war On 12 November 1864, before the siege of Paysand√∫, the Paraguayan dictator Solano L√≥pez seized the Brazilian steamer Marqu√™s de Olinda, beginning the Paraguayan War. While the Army of the South crossed Uruguay heading toward Paysand√∫, Brazil's government sent Jos√© Maria da Silva Paranhos (later Viscount of Rio Branco) to replace Saraiva. He arrived in the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires on 2 December and a few days later sought a formal alliance with Mitre against the Blancos. The Argentine president refused, insisting that neither he nor his government had any role in Flores' rebellion, and that Argentina would remain neutral. On 26 December, the Paraguayans invaded the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso, laying waste to towns and the countryside. As the situation deteriorated, the Brazilian government mobilized army units from other regions of the Empire. On 1 January 1865, one brigade (composed of two infantry battalions and one artillery battalion) with 1,700 men from the Brazilian province of Rio de Janeiro disembarked and occupied the Uruguayan town of Fray Bentos.See: * ; * ; * . Paranhos, along with Tamandar√©, met Flores in Fray Bentos and decided to launch a combined attack against Montevideo. It was apparent that the Paraguayans would take too long to reach Uruguay and no help would come from Urquiza and his Argentine Federalists. Increasingly isolated, Aguirre hoped that the foreign powers could intervene, but when, on 11 January, he asked the diplomatic corps in Montevideo whether they would provide military assistance to him and his government, none responded positively. Jo√£o Prop√≠cio Mena Barreto sailed from Fray Bentos on 14 January with the Brazilian infantry, bound for a landing near the mouth of the Santa Luc√≠a River near Montevideo. On the way, he occupied the Uruguayan town of Colonia del Sacramento, garrisoning it with 50 soldiers. The cavalry and artillery were placed under Os√≥rio and went overland. They met Jo√£o Prop√≠cio Mena Barreto and the infantry at their landing place. From there, the reunited Army of the South marched on Montevideo. On 31 January, Brazil and the Colorados besieged the Uruguayan capital. In the meantime, on 19 January, Paranhos attempted to clarify the nature of the Brazilian operations against the Blancos. He issued notes to the foreign diplomatic corps in Buenos Aires declaring that a state of war existed between Brazil and Uruguay. Until then, there had been no formal declaration of war, and the Empire's military operations in Uruguay since August 1864 had been mere \\"reprisals\\"‚Äîthe vague term used by Brazilian diplomacy since the ultimatum.See: * ; * ; * ; * . =Armistice= Montevideo, capital of Uruguay, 1865 In an attempt to divert the attention of Brazil from the siege of the capital, the Blanco government ordered the \\"Vanguard Army of the Republic of Uruguay\\", composed of 1,500 men under General Basilio Mu√±oz, to invade Brazilian soil. On 27 January 1865, Mu√±oz crossed the border and exchanged fire with 500 cavalrymen from Brazil's National Guard units. The Brazilians retreated to the town of Jaguar√£o, where they were joined by 90 infantrymen also from the National Guard, and hurriedly constructed trenches. There were also two small steamers and one other large vessel, each equipped with one artillery piece, to protect Jaguar√£o. The Blanco army attacked the town in the Battle of Jaguar√£o, but were repelled. Mu√±oz established a brief siege and asked Colonel Manuel Pereira Vargas (the commander of the Brazilian garrison) to surrender, but to no effect. In the early hours of 28 January, Mu√±oz retreated with his men toward Uruguay, ransacking property and taking all the slaves they could find. On 2 February, Tamandar√© declared to foreign diplomats that Montevideo was under siege and blockade.See: * ; * ; * . The Uruguayan capital was defended by between 3,500 and 4,000 armed men with little to no combat experience and 40 artillery pieces of various calibers. On 16 February, the Army of the South was further reinforced by 1,228 men from the 8th Battalion of Ca√ßadores (Sharpshooters) arriving from the Brazilian province of Bahia, raising its numbers to 8,116. Sousa Neto and his gauchos had detached from the main force weeks before to pursue Mu√±oz and his army. British and French nationals were evacuated to Buenos Aires. The \\"general exodus of foreigners that followed caused those who remained in Montevideo to feel terror for the first time. All agreed that a full-scale assault against the city could not be postponed.\\" However, neither Paranhos nor his government were willing to risk the destruction of Montevideo and face the inevitable outcry from other nations that would follow it. On 15 February, Aguirre's term of office expired.See: * ; * ; * . Against the wishes of the Amapolas, the moderate Tom√°s Villalba was elected by the Senate to replace Aguirre. French, Italian and Spanish troops landed in Montevideo at Villalba's request to dissuade the radical Blancos from attempting a coup to retake power.See: * ; * ; * . Villalba entered into talks with Flores and Paranhos. With the Italian resident minister Raffaele Ulisse Barbolani serving as intermediary, an agreement was reached. Flores and Manuel Herrera y Obes (representing Villalba's government) signed a peace accord on 20 February at the Villa de la Uni√≥n. A general amnesty was granted to both Blancos and Colorados, and Villalba handed over the presidency to Flores on an interim basis until elections could be held.See: * ; * ; * ; * . Aftermath Brazilian troops in Rio Grande do Sul heading toward the front, 1865 In early March, Flores assembled a cabinet composed entirely of Colorados, among them a brother of the Blanco Leandro G√≥mez. The new Uruguayan president purged government departments of employees with Fusionist or Blanco associations. All Blanco officers and enlisted men were eliminated from the army and replaced by those Colorado and Brazilian loyalists who had remained with Flores throughout the conflict. Public commemorations glorified the Colorados, and a monument dedicated to the \\"Martyrs of Quinteros\\" was erected. The costs of the Liberating Crusade are unknown. Flores' losses amounted to around 450 dead and wounded; there are no estimates of the number of civilians who died of famine and disease, nor is it known how much damage was sustained by the national economy. The effects of the Uruguayan War have received little attention from historians, who have been drawn to focus on the dramatic devastation suffered by Paraguay in the subsequent Paraguayan War. News of the war's end was brought by Pereira Pinto and met with joy in Rio de Janeiro. Brazilian Emperor Dom Pedro II found himself waylaid by a crowd of thousands in the streets amid acclamations. But public opinion quickly changed for the worse, when newspapers began running stories painting the accord of 20 February as harmful to Brazilian interests, for which the cabinet was blamed. The newly raised Viscount of Tamandar√© and Mena Barreto (now Baron of S√£o Gabriel) had supported the peace accord. Tamandar√© changed his mind soon afterward and played along with the allegations. Paranhos (a member of the opposition party) was used as a scapegoat by the Emperor and the government, and was recalled in disgrace to the imperial capital. Subsequent events show the accusation was unfounded. Not only had Paranhos managed to settle all Brazilian claims, but by avoiding the death of thousands, he gained a willing and grateful Uruguayan ally, not a dubious and resentful one‚Äîwho provided Brazil an important base of operations during the war with Paraguay that followed.See: * ; * ; * . Victory brought mixed results for Brazil and Argentina. As the Brazilian government had expected, the conflict was a short-lived and relatively easy affair that led to the installation of a friendly government in Uruguay. The official estimates included 549 battlefield casualties (109 dead, 439 wounded and 1 missing) from the navy and army and an unknown number who died from disease. Historian Jos√© Bernardino Bormann put the total at 616 (204 dead, 411 wounded and 1 missing). The war would have been deemed an outstanding success for Brazil, had it not been for its terrible consequences. Instead of demonstrating strength, Brazil revealed military weakness that an emboldened Paraguay sought to exploit. From the Argentine viewpoint, most of Bartolom√© Mitre's expectations were frustrated by the war's outcome. He had succeeded in bringing to power his friend and ally, but the minimal risk and cost to Argentina he had envisioned at the outset proved to be illusory. The resulting attack by Paraguay on Brazilian and Argentine provinces sparked the long and devastating Paraguayan War.

Composition  The album was described as \\"what a pop album should sound like\\" and \\"the most essential pop album of 2009\\" by AbsolutePunk. AllMusic compared the trio to Queen and the Electric Light Orchestra. It was said \\"it used previous Format tricks like using bright horns and sophisticated harmonies\\". Release On April 20, 2009, it was revealed that fans could download \\"At Least I'm Not as Sad (As I Used to Be)\\" for free upon signing up with the band's mailing list. In addition, it was mentioned that the band's debut album would be released in August. Between late April and early June, the band supported Manchester Orchestra on their headlining tour of the US. On May 19, Aim and Ignite was announced for release in August. In addition, the album's track listing was revealed. In August, the band went on a tour of the US with Hellogoodbye, Limbeck and My Favorite Highway. Aim and Ignite was released on August 25 through Nettwerk. Two of the bonus tracks are re-imagined versions of songs on the CD, and two are remixes. The title of the album comes from a line of the lyrics on the track \\"Light a Roman Candle with Me\\".  Reception  Aim and Ignite was released to positive reviews. AbsolutePunk.net's Drew Beringer praised the album, calling it \\"what a pop album should sound like\\" and \\"the most essential pop album of 2009\\". AllMusic called the album \\"progressive, but in the best possible way\\" and admired Ruess's lyrics for \\"investigating the larger truths of life...with a witty approach that keeps the songs bubbling merrily along on a positive note\\". Dave de Sylvia of Sputnikmusic wrote, \\"Aim and Ignite isn‚Äôt the most consistent pop album around,\\" but he ultimately commended the album as \\"a superbly mixed and arranged album made by musicians who clearly understand the limits and potential of pop music\\". Estella Hung of PopMatters was less impressed with the album, praising songs \\"Be Calm\\" and \\"The Gambler\\", but criticizing the lyrics and production of the album's early tracks. Hung concluded that while Aim and Ignite is \\"pretty original to say the least\\", it \\"fails to live up to the Format's last outing\\". Popdose's Ken Shane called the album \\"an interesting and unusual listen\\". Shane applauded the album's songwriting and said \\"many of the songs are really good\\", but he objected to the \\"cute\\" production, desiring to hear the band \\"in a more stripped-down form. He ended his review with: \\"I have a similar problem with Dr. Dog, a band that was recommended to me by a number of people. I think much of their recorded work is too fussed over, but when I saw them live and their sound was more stripped down out of necessity, emphasizing their powerful songwriting, I thought they were wonderful.

Limmer (born January 24, 1955) is a Minnesota politician and member of the Minnesota Senate. A member of the Republican Party of Minnesota, he represents the 34th District, which includes portions of Hennepin County in the northwestern Twin Cities metropolitan area. Limmer previously served in the Minnesota House of Representatives, and in 1998 he sought the Republican endorsement for Minnesota Secretary of State, losing to Mary Kiffmeyer. He was the author of the 2012 Minnesota constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. Early life, education, and career Limmer attended North Hennepin Community College, where he received an A.A., and St. Cloud State University, where he received a B.A. in criminal justice studies. He worked as a corrections officer before serving in the legislature. Limmer is a former member of the Hennepin County Corrections Advisory Commission and the Crystal Human Rights Commission. He now works as a real estate agent.. Minnesota Legislature Before being elected to the Minnesota Senate, Limmer was a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, first elected in 1988 in the old House District 48A, and reelected in 1990, 1992 and 1994. After the 1992 redistricting, the area became House District 33B. Limmer was first elected to the Senate in a February 1995 special election held after Senator Patrick McGowan resigned upon being elected Hennepin County Sheriff. Limmer has been continuously reelected since, running unopposed in 2010. He served as an assistant minority leader from 2005 to 2006. His special legislative concerns include criminal justice, public education, safe school legislation, economic development, and tax reform. On April 27, 2011, Limmer introduced a bill to propose a referendum on an amendment to the Minnesota Constitution banning same-sex marriage. The bill passed, and Minnesota voters rejected the amendment in the 2012 general election by six percentage points. Also in 2012 voters rejected Republicans' attempt to require government-issued identification to vote, siding with amendment opponents who argued that Voter ID would disproportionately suppress votes of immigrants, the elderly, disabled people and communities of color, and elected a Democratic majority in both the House and Senate, throwing Republicans out after only two years in the majority in both chambers‚Äîa result considered to be electoral backlash to Republican overreach. In the following legislative session DFL Senator Scott Dibble and DFL Representative Karen Clark introduced bills to legalize same- sex marriage in Minnesota. The Minnesota House of Representatives voted 75‚Äì59 in favor of legalization.http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/votes/votes.asp?ls_year=88&billnum;=HF1054&session;_number=0&year;=2013&id;=533 A few days later, after debate on the Senate floor, the body also voted for legalization, 37‚Äì30. On May 14, 2013, in front of a crowd of 7,000 people on the Capitol Mall in St. Paul, Governor Mark Dayton signed Dibble's and Clark's marriage equality bill into law, making Minnesota the 12th state to legalize gay marriage. Limmer opposes universal background checks for gun purchases. As chair of the Senate Judiciary's public safety committee, he has refused to allow any hearings on gun safety.

It was the only game to be created by NMK for the Neo Geo platform. Set in a futuristic sci-fi setting, players assume the role from either of the three playable characters in an attempt to overthrow an army of enemies led by the on-board supercomputer at the automated Yggdrasil space station and seize full control of it once again. Although it was initially only launched for the Neo Geo MVS (arcade), Zed Blade was later re-released by HAMSTER Corporation through download services for various consoles in 2017. Conversions for both Neo Geo AES (home) and Neo Geo CD were planned and even previewed but neither received an official release to the public. Zed Blade has garnered mixed critical reception since its original release in arcades from reviewers who felt mixed towards several aspects of the game such as the colorful but generic visuals, unremarkable weapons system, short length and low difficulty, although most praise was given to the music and some critics noted it to be its main highlight.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot featuring Roc Carrier, the first boss of the game. Zed Blade is a horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up game similar to Gradius III and Last Resort, where players assume the role from either of the three playable characters (master sergeant Uncle Beard, sergeant Ms. Charlotte and corporal Swift Arnold) with their respective space fighter crafts through eight stages that take place on a futuristic sci-fi setting across the Solar System in a last-ditch effort to stop the invasion against humanity on Earth led by Yggdrasil's on-board supercomputer with his army of enemies and regain full control of the unit once more as the main objective. In addition to the single-player mode, the game also features a two-player cooperative multiplayer mode. If a memory card is present, the player is allowed to save their progress and resume into the last stage the game saved at. A noteworthy gameplay aspect of the title is that prior to starting, players can arrange the weapon system of their picked ship in the character selection screen, of which have their speed setting already pre-determined, by choosing between three options for frontal shots, missiles and rear shots, all of which are fired by pressing the A button and controlling the ship is performed with the joystick. In addition to the three main weapons, players are also equipped with set number of bombs depending on the ship chosen at the beginning that are fired by pressing the B button, while its firepower can be increased by collecting a hyper bomb upgrade capable of dealing maximum damage against enemies and bosses, the latter of which are fought at the end of each stage in order to progress further through the game. Some of the enemies carry power-up items, which appear as colored orbs and alters between the three main weapons after a certain time period passes that can be picked to increase the firepower of either frontal shots, missiles or rear shots. Enemies will also carry extra bomb stocks and hyper bomb upgrades as well. Items will bounce back after reaching the right edge of the screen, however if they are not picked up after this occurs, items will be gone permanently once they have reached the left edge of the screen including 1UP icons, which are spawned after reaching a determined score threshold. Another noteworthy aspect of the title is the scoring system, which allow players to obtain additional points for shooting solid objects from the stages, as well as indestructible parts of large enemies and bosses. Getting hit by enemy fire or colliding against solid stage obstacles will result in losing a live, as well as a penalty of decreasing the ship's weapons to one level and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the player insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing.  Synopsis  Zed Blade takes place in a futuristic sci-fi setting where mankind has managed to expand into the stars and travel to every planet in the Solar System. A large project to establish a space frontier was started with the development of an automated space station named Yggdrasil, which is controlled by a state-of-the-art supercomputer, however the crew of the Yggdrasil began to refuse in responding any of the incoming communications from Earth months after its deployment, with Yggdrasil suddenly launching attacks against Earth through usage of a large fleet of highly developed space fighters, robots and war machines that leads to the enactment of \\"Operation Ragnarok\\", where three of the best space fighter pilots from Earth must restore order by seizing control of Yggdrasil and halting the invasion.  Development and release  Zed Blade served as the only title created by NMK for Neo Geo and was initially only launched for the arcades by SNK on September 13, 1994. Its soundtrack was done by composer Manabu Namiki. A Neo Geo AES version was announced and completed but never released. A Neo Geo CD version was also announced and even showcased for playing to the attendees at SNK's booth during the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in 1995 but like the AES version, it was never released. The game has since received a re-release in 2017 on various digital distribution platforms such as the Nintendo eShop, PlayStation Network and Xbox Live as part of the ACA Neo Geo series by HAMSTER Corporation.  Reception  Zed Blade received mixed reception from critics since its initial release. Captain Squideo of GamePro praised the frenetic action, cooperative play, controls, weapons system, visuals and sound design. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly felt mixed in regards to the title, with some praising and others criticizing both the visuals and sound design, as well as its short length and low difficulty level. AllGame's Kyle Knight regarded the game for being unremarkable in terms of its weapons system, although he praised the graphics, music, gameplay and replay value. In a retrospective review, Dave Frear from Nintendo Life praised the colorful graphics and music but criticized the amount of slowdown when too many objects are present on-screen. Martin Gaksch of German magazine MAN!AC gave an overall mixed review of the game.

In the film, Cusack plays a Buffalo, New York cop who has been chasing a serial kidnapper who abducts young women.  Plot  In Buffalo, New York, a man named Carl picks up a woman he thinks is a prostitute and takes her to his home. When he spots that she is transsexual, he angrily murders her, cuts up the body, and places the pieces in a freezer. Meanwhile, Mike Fletcher, a detective, becomes obsessed with the case, which is under threat of being shut down due to its inactivity. A troubled Thanksgiving holiday dinner reveals that he has been ignoring his family, including his rebellious daughter, Abby. Following an argument with her mother, Abby sneaks out of the house to be with her boyfriend Tad. At the diner where he works, Tad breaks up with her, and Abby runs outside. Tad sees her talk to a person in a car; when he next looks, she has disappeared. Carl kidnaps Abby and chains her up in his basement, where he keeps two other young women prisoner, Brittany and Lauren, who suffer from Stockholm syndrome. Mike and his partner, Kelsey Walker, immediately investigate Abby's disappearance. Although he initially denies any knowledge of Abby's disappearance, Tad shows up at the police station the next day and identifies Darrell, a former suspect and Carl's co-conspirator, who he saw at the diner. Mike and Kelsey interrogate Darrell, but Mike physically assaults him and is taken off the case. Mike breaks into Darrell's house and finds a list of pharmaceuticals that Darrell has supplied to Carl, before Kelsey shows up to back him up. He takes the list to the hospital and has a brief conversation with Carl, who works as a cook there. Darrell's boss tells Mike that Darrell has not shown up for work and the list of drugs is written by a non-professional. Mike calls the company on the back of the list in the hope of finding him, but they are too busy to immediately respond. That night, a snow storm shuts down the airport and forces Darrell to stay in town. Mike and Kelsey track Darrell to a hotel but find Darrell dead and circumstantial evidence planted by Carl pointing to him as the kidnapper. Mike receives a call from the company, which turns out to be a catering company. He pieces that together with details of Carl's description by a would-be victim and realizes that Carl is the killer. He and Kelsey make their way to Carl's house as Kelsey reports it over the phone. Meanwhile, Abby, who had framed Brittany for breaking Carl's rules, convinces him that Brittany was just celebrating the fact she is pregnant, and Abby takes Brittany's place for a special dinner he had planned; she uses this opportunity to stab him with a corkscrew. Carl throws her back into the basement, where a pregnant Lauren's water has broken. Due to her immobility, she asks Abby to help cut the baby out. Mike and Kelsey arrive at the house and find plenty of evidence, including a nursery with several babies in it. They hear noises from below, and, searching for the basement, Mike briefly talks to Abby over the house intercom. Abby tells him that Carl keeps the basement door key around his neck. Mike confronts and shoots Carl, but Kelsey picks up Carl's discarded shotgun and shoots Mike, revealing that she was with Carl the entire time (as she was Carl's first victim); her infertility left them unable to have children, so he set up the operation to kidnap prostitutes and force them to have children. Carl dies, but before Kelsey kills Mike, he reveals that Abby is pregnant. Kelsey frees Abby and takes Lauren's just-born baby, assuring them that they're safe. The police find Carl's nursery, which is now empty. Weeks later, Kelsey, using a new name, is shown to have moved to another city with the missing babies. She leaves a phone message to Abby in which she congratulates Abby on her expectant motherhood, which Abby later listens to, including the sound of a baby crying in the background.

He was the third and youngest son of Duke Bolko I of Opole by his wife Agnes, probably daughter of Margrave Otto III of Brandenburg. He was the second and last member of the Piast dynasty who bore this name (the first was a son of W≈Çadys≈Çaw II the Exile). Life After his father's death in 1313 Albert and his older brother Bolko II inherited Opole, but because both are minors at that time, the regency was held by their oldest brother Boles≈Çaw the Elder until 1323, when they assumed the full government over his domains; however, soon after Albert and Bolko II decided to make the formal division of their domains: Bolko II retain the main city of Opole and Albert took Strzelce. About his internal and foreign politics there are little notices. In 1327, he became a vassal of the Bohemian crown; but, for unknown reasons, he didn't paid homage to King John of Luxembourg with the other Silesian Dukes in Opawa. In 1326, he granted urban Privileges to the capital of his Duchy, Strzelce. He also supported financially the Cistercian monastery of Jemielnica, who was founded by his father. It's unknown the exact date of his death. The last notice of Albert as a living person was around 1366, although some historians assumed that he died by between 1370‚Äì1375. He was buried in the monastery of Jemielnica, where his portrait is shown there until today. Marriage and issue In 1347, Albert married with Agnes (d. 27 May 1371), daughter of Count Burchard I of Hardegg, Burgrave of Magdeburg. They had one daughter: #Elisabeth (b. ca. 1348 ‚Äì d. by 17 April 1361), married bef. 1 December 1359 to W≈Çadys≈Çaw the White, Duke of Gniewkowo.

When the institution makes the Student Award, it appoints the recipient as its representative to bear its standard before the world.\\" The Award consists of a copper medallion, an engraved certificate, and the biography of Algernon Sydney Sullivan. Recipients were chosen yearly from the graduation class of each institution, which also had the privilege of honoring one non-student conspicuously helpful to and associated with the institution in its effort to encourage and preserve a high standard of character. The award was first given by the New York Southern Society in honor of prominent New York lawyer, Algernon Sydney Sullivan, at Peabody College in Nashville, now part of Vanderbilt University. That success led to the establishment of the Award in other institutions, and for the disposition of the fund provided for that purpose. By 1934, the Algernon Sydney Sullivan Award was being presented to deserving individuals at thirteen colleges throughout the South. In 1936, the Algernon Sydney Sullivan Foundation began distributing scholarships at four of those institutions. Notable recipients *Cynthia Bathurst, animal rights activist *Hester A.

The game sets itself apart from other multiplayer tower defense games since up to 8 players all play on the same board. In addition more than 40 different maps are playable making the maze and board size not fixed. Gameplay Like other tower defense games, players try to destroy the enemies (called creeps) walking past their towers, however, in GauntNet there are creeps for each team. Players receive money for killing creeps and for their creeps not reaching the exit. Thus players try to kill other players creeps as well to get extra money. If a players creeps get to their exit, they lose a life. Once losing all their lives, a player is removed from the board along with all their towers. Play continues until all players have died or the last wave is destroyed. The winner is then the player with the most points. Like other tower defense games, upgrading towers is very important to play well. In addition, players are constantly competing to build mazes with their towers that benefit them and hurt other players. Thus, players often sell and rearrange towers to compete with their opponents.

It was last branch line to be built by the North Staffordshire Railway. Intended to route traffic to Trentham Gardens, the branch was authorised in 1907 and opened on 1 April 1910. It left the main line at Trentham Junction where there was a platform connected by a short path to , although Trentham Junction itself never appeared as a separate station in the timetable. Abortive extension By the time of its opening, local traffic was already being carried by road. As a result, the only intermediate station, Hanford Road Halt, was closed after just three years. However, the original plan was to extend the line to Pool Dam, Newcastle-under-Lyme, to form a four mile long route around the growing suburbs. In preparation for this a steel bridge was constructed in September 1914 over London Road (now part of the A34) just beyond Trentham Park, but the extension was halted by World War I. It remained as a bridge to nowhere until 1940, when it was dismantled for scrap for the World War II effort. World War II During the war, the branch was at its busiest due to the Bank of England having temporarily relocated its clearing house to Trentham Hall. Numerous unpublicised passenger trains ran to serve it, along with a daily freight working.

Ancient Greek sources note Orpheus' Thracian origins.Fritz Graf and Sarah Iles Johnston, Ritual Texts for the Afterlife: Orpheus and the Bacchic Gold Tablets (Routledge, 2007), p. 167, while taking note of depictions in Greek art, particularly vase painting, that show Orpheus attired as a Greek, often in contrast to those in Thracian dress around him. The major stories about him are centered on his ability to charm all living things and even stones with his music (the usual scene in Orpheus mosaics), his attempt to retrieve his wife Eurydice from the underworld, and his death at the hands of the maenads of Dionysus who tired of his mourning for his late wife Eurydice. As an archetype of the inspired singer, Orpheus is one of the most significant figures in the reception of classical mythology in Western culture, portrayed or alluded to in countless forms of art and popular culture including poetry, film, opera, music, and painting.Geoffrey Miles, Classical Mythology in English Literature: A Critical Anthology (Routledge, 1999), p. 54ff. For the Greeks, Orpheus was a founder and prophet of the so-called \\"Orphic\\" mysteries.Pausanias, Description of Greece, Corinth, 2.30.2 He was credited with the composition of the Orphic Hymns and the Orphic Argonautica. Shrines containing purported relics of Orpheus were regarded as oracles. Etymology Several etymologies for the name Orpheus have been proposed. A probable suggestion is that it is derived from a hypothetical PIE root 'orphan, servant, slave' and ultimately the verb root 'to change allegiance, status, ownership.'Cf. \\"·ΩàœÅœÜŒ±ŒΩœåœÇ\\" in: Etymological Dictionary of Greek, ed.

Classical Mythology in English Literature: A Critical Anthology, London: Routledge, 1999, p. 57. Background It was believed by Aristotle that Orpheus never existed, but to all other ancient writers he was a real person, though living in remote antiquity. Most of them believed that he lived several generations before Homer. The earliest literary reference to Orpheus is a two-word fragment of the 6th century BC lyric poet Ibycus: ('Orpheus famous-of-name'). He is not mentioned in Homer or Hesiod.Ibycus, Fragments 17 (Diehl); M. Owen Lee, Virgil as Orpheus: A Study of the Georgics State University of New York Press, Albany (1996), p. 3. Most ancient sources accept his historical existence; Aristotle is an exception.Kathleen Freeman, Ancilla to the Pre-Socratic Philosophers, Harvard University Press (1948), p. 1. Pindar calls Orpheus 'the father of songs'Pindar, Pythian Odes, 4.4.315 and identifies him as a son of the Thracian king OeagrusPindar fragment 126.9. and the Muse Calliope.Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheke 1.3.2, Argonautica 1.23, and the Orphic Hymn 24.12. Attic red-figure bell-krater (c. 440 BC) Greeks of the Classical age venerated Orpheus as the greatest of all poets and musicians; it was said that while Hermes had invented the lyre, Orpheus had perfected it. Poets such as Simonides of Ceos said that Orpheus' music and singing could charm the birds, fish and wild beasts, coax the trees and rocks into dance,Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheke 1.3.2; Euripides, Iphigeneia at Aulis, 1212 and The Bacchae, 562; Ovid, Metamorphoses 11: \\"with his songs, Orpheus, the bard of Thrace, allured the trees, the savage animals, and even the insensate rocks, to follow him>\\" and divert the course of rivers. Orpheus was one of the handful of Greek heroesOthers to brave the nekyia were Odysseus, Theseus and Heracles; Perseus also overcame Medusa in a chthonic setting. to visit the Underworld and return; his music and song even had power over Hades. The earliest known reference to this descent to the underworld is the painting by Polygnotus (5th century BC) described by Pausanias (2nd century AD), where no mention is made of Eurydice. Euripides and Plato both refer to the story of his descent to recover his wife, but do not mention her name; a contemporary relief (about 400 BC) shows Orpheus and his wife with Hermes. The elegiac poet Hermesianax called her Agriope; and the first mention of her name in literature is in the Lament for Bion (1st century BC) Some sources credit Orpheus with further gifts to mankind: medicine, which is more usually under the auspices of Asclepius (Aesculapius) or Apollo; writing,A single literary epitaph, attributed to the sophist Alcidamas, credits Orpheus with the invention of writing. See Ivan Mortimer Linforth, \\"Two Notes on the Legend of Orpheus\\", Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association 62, (1931):5‚Äì17). which is usually credited to Cadmus; and agriculture, where Orpheus assumes the Eleusinian role of Triptolemus as giver of Demeter's knowledge to mankind. Orpheus was an augur and seer; he practiced magical arts and astrology, founded cults to Apollo and DionysusApollodorus (Pseudo Apollodorus), Library and Epitome, 1.3.2. \\"Orpheus also invented the mysteries of Dionysus, and having been torn in pieces by the Maenads he is buried in Pieria.\\" and prescribed the mystery rites preserved in Orphic texts. Pindar and Apollonius of RhodesApollonius, Argonautica, passim. place Orpheus as the harpist and companion of Jason and the Argonauts. Orpheus had a brother named Linus, who went to Thebes and became a Theban.Apollodorus, Library and Epitome, 2.4.9, This Linus was a brother of Orpheus; he came to Thebes and became a Theban. He is claimed by Aristophanes and Horace to have taught cannibals to subsist on fruit, and to have made lions and tigers obedient to him. Horace believed, however, that Orpheus had only introduced order and civilization to savages. Strabo (64 BC ‚Äì c. AD 24) presents Orpheus as a mortal, who lived and died in a village close to Olympus.Strabo, Geography, Book 7, Chapter 7: \\"At the base of Olympus is a city Dium. And it has a village near by, Pimpleia. Here lived Orpheus, the Ciconian, it is said ‚Äî a wizard who at first collected money from his music, together with his soothsaying and his celebration of the orgies connected with the mystic initiatory rites, but soon afterwards thought himself worthy of still greater things and procured for himself a throng of followers and power. Some, of course, received him willingly, but others, since they suspected a plot and violence, combined against him and killed him. And near here, also, is Leibethra.\\" \\"Some, of course, received him willingly, but others, since they suspected a plot and violence, combined against him and killed him.\\" He made money as a musician and \\"wizard\\" ‚Äì Strabo uses (),Gregory Nagy, Archaic Period (Greek Literature, Volume 2), , p. 46. also used by Sophocles in Oedipus Tyrannus to characterize Tiresias as a trickster with an excessive desire for possessions. () most often meant charlatanIndex in Eustathii commentarios in Homeri Iliadem et Odysseam by Matthaeus Devarius, p. 8. and always had a negative connotation. Pausanias writes of an unnamed Egyptian who considered Orpheus a (), i. e., magician.Pausanias, The Description of Greece, 6.20.18: \\"A man of Egypt said that Pelops received something from Amphion the Theban and buried it where is what they call Taraxippus, adding that it was the buried thing which frightened the mares of Oenomaus, as well as those of every charioteer since. This Egyptian thought that Amphion and the Thracian Orpheus were clever magicians, and that it was through their enchantments that the beasts came to Orpheus, and the stones came to Amphion for the building of the wall. The most probable of the stories in my opinion makes Taraxippus a surname of Horse Poseidon.\\" \\"Orpheus...is repeatedly referred to by Euripides, in whom we find the first allusion to the connection of Orpheus with Dionysus and the infernal regions: he speaks of him as related to the Muses (Rhesus 944, 946); mentions the power of his song over rocks, trees, and wild beasts (Medea 543, Iphigenia in Aulis 1211, Bacchae 561, and a jocular allusion in Cyclops 646); refers to his charming the infernal powers (Alcestis 357); connects him with Bacchanalian orgies (Hippolytus 953); ascribes to him the origin of sacred mysteries (Rhesus 943), and places the scene of his activity among the forests of Olympus (Bacchae 561.)\\" \\"Euripides [also] brought Orpheus into his play Hypsipyle, which dealt with the Lemnian episode of the Argonautic voyage; Orpheus there acts as coxswain, and later as guardian in Thrace of Jason‚Äôs children by Hypsipyle.\\" \\"He is mentioned once only, but in an important passage, by Aristophanes (Frogs 1032), who enumerates, as the oldest poets, Orpheus, Musaeus, Hesiod, and Homer, and makes Orpheus the teacher of religious initiations and of abstinence from murder...\\" \\"Plato (Apology, Protagoras),...frequently refers to Orpheus, his followers, and his works. He calls him the son of Oeagrus (Symposium), mentions him as a musician and inventor (Ion and Laws bk 3.), refers to the miraculous power of his lyre (Protagoras), and gives a singular version of the story of his descent into Hades: the gods, he says, imposed upon the poet, by showing him only a phantasm of his lost wife, because he had not the courage to die, like Alcestis, but contrived to enter Hades alive, and, as a further punishment for his cowardice, he met his death at the hands of women (Symposium.)\\" \\"Earlier than the literary references is a sculptured representation of Orpheus with the ship Argo, found at Delphi, said to be of the sixth century B.C.\\" [c.a. 560 BCE]  Writings  On the writings of Orpheus, Freeman, in the 1946 edition of The Pre- Socratic Philosophers pp. 4‚Äì8, writes: \\"In the fifth and fourth centuries BC, there existed a collection of hexametric poems known as Orphic, which were the accepted authority of those who followed the Orphic way of life, and were by them attributed to Orpheus himself. Plato several times quotes lines from this collection; he refers in the Republic to a ‚Äòmass of books of Musaeus and Orpheus‚Äô, and in the Laws to the hymns of Thamyris and Orpheus, while in the Ion he groups Orpheus with Musaeus and Homer as the source of inspiration of epic poets and elocutionists. Euripides in the Hippolytus makes Theseus speak of the ‚Äòturgid outpourings of many treatises‚Äô, which have led his son to follow Orpheus and adopt the Bacchic religion. Alexis, the fourth century comic poet, depicting Linus offering a choice of books to Heracles, mentions ‚ÄòOrpheus, Hesiod, tragedies, Choerilus, Homer, Epicharmus‚Äô. Aristotle did not believe that the poems were by Orpheus; he speaks of the ‚Äòso-called Orphic epic‚Äô, and Philoponus (seventh century AD) commenting on this expression, says that in the De Philosophia (now lost) Aristotle directly stated his opinion that the poems were not by Orpheus. Philoponus adds his own view that the doctrines were put into epic verse by Onomacritus. Aristotle when quoting the Orphic cosmological doctrines attributes them to ‚Äòthe theologoi‚Äô ‚Äòthe ancient poets‚Äô, ‚Äòthose who first theorized about the gods ‚Äô. Nothing is known of any ancient Orphic writings except a reference in the Alcestis of Euripides to certain ‚ÄòThracian tablets‚Äô which ‚Äòthe voice of Orpheus had inscribed‚Äô with pharmaceutical lore. The Scholiast, commenting on the passage, says that there exist on Mt. Haemus certain writings of Orpheus on tablets. There is also a reference, not mentioning Orpheus by name, in the pseudo-Platonic Axiochus, where it is said that the fate of the soul in Hades is described on certain bronze tablets which two seers had brought to Delos from the land of the Hyperboreans. This is the only evidence for any ancient Orphic writings. Aelian (second century AD) gave the chief reason against believing in them: at the time when Orpheus is said to have lived, the Thracians knew nothing about writing. It came therefore to be believed that Orpheus taught, but left no writings, and that the epic poetry attributed to him was written in the sixth century BC by Onomacritus. Onomacritus was banished from Athens by Hipparchus for inserting something of his own into an oracle of Musaeus when entrusted with the editing of his poems. It may have been Aristotle who first suggested, in the lost De Philosophia, that Onomacritus also wrote the so-called Orphic epic poems. By the time when the Orphic writings began to be freely quoted by Christian and Neo-Platonist writers, the theory of the authorship of Onomacritus was accepted by many. It is believed, however, that the Orphic literature current in the time of the Neo-Platonists (third century AD), and quoted by them as the authority for Orphic doctrines, was a collection of writings of different periods and varying outlook, something like that of the Bible. The earliest of these were composed in the sixth century by Onomacritus from genuine Orphic tradition; the latest which have survived, namely the Voyage of the Argonauts, and the Hymns to various deities, cannot have been put together in their present form until the beginning of the Christian era, and are probably to be dated some time between the second and fourth centuries AD The Neo-Platonists quote the Orphic poems in their defence against Christianity, because Plato used poems which he believed to be Orphic. It is believed that in the collection of writings which they used there were several versions, each of which gave a slightly different account of the origin of the universe, of gods and men, and perhaps of the correct way of life, with the rewards and punishments attached thereto. Three principal versions are recognized by modern scholars; all three are mentioned by the Neo-Platonist Damascius (fifth-sixth centuries AD). These are: # Rhapsodiae, epic lays, said by Damascius to give the usual Orphic theology. These are mentioned also in Suidas‚Äô list, as ‚Äòsacred discourses in twenty-four lays‚Äô, though he attributes this work to Theognetus the Thessalian (unknown) or Cercops the Pythagorean. This is now referred to as the Rhapsodic Theogony. It is the version usually quoted by ancient authorities, but was not the one used by Plato, and is therefore some-times thought to have been composed after he wrote; this question cannot at present be decided. # An Orphic Theogony given by Aristotle‚Äôs pupil Eudemus. # An Orphic Theogony ‚Äòaccording to Hieronymus and Hellanicus‚Äô. Other versions were: a Theogony put into the mouth of Orpheus by Apollonius Rhodius in his Argonautica an Orphic Theogony quoted by Alexander of Aphrodisias; and a Theogony in Clement of Rome, not specified as Orphic, but belonging to the same school of thought. A long list of Orphic works is given in Suidas (tenth century AD); but most of these are there attributed to other authors. They are: # Triagmoi, attributed to the tragic poet Ion, in which there was said to be a chapter called Sacred Vestments, or Cosmic Invocations. The title Triagmoi apparently referred to ‚Äòthe Orphic tripod of three elements, earth, water, fire‚Äô, referred to by Ausonius and Galen; the latter said that this doctrine was given by Onomacritus in his Orphic poems. # The Sacred Discourses, already discussed, usually identified with the Rhapsodiae. # Oracles and Rites, attributed to Onomacritus. # Aids to Salvation, ascribed to Timocles of Syracuse or Persinus of Miletus; both the work and these writers are otherwise unknown. # Mixing-bowls, ascribed to Zopyrus of Heracleia; and The Robe and The Net, also ascribed to Zopyrus, or to Brontinus the Pythagorean. The Net referred to is the net of the body, so called in Orphic literature. To Brontinus was also ascribed a Physica, otherwise unknown. # Enthronement of the Mother, and Bacchic Rites, ascribed to Nicias of Elea, of whom nothing else is known. ‚ÄòEnthronement‚Äô was part of the rite of initiation practised by the Corybantes, the worshippers of Rhea or Cybele; the person to be initiated was seated on a high chair, and the celebrants danced round him in a ring. The title therefore apparently means ‚Äòthe enthronement-ceremonies as practised by the worshippers of the Great Mother‚Äô. Connected, perhaps identical with, this was a treatise on Corybantic Rites, quoted by the late Orphic poem Argonautica. # A Descent into Hades, ascribed to Herodicus of Perinthus, or to Cercops the Pythagorean, or to the unknown Prodicus of Samos. # Other treatises were: an Astronomy or Astrology, otherwise unknown; Sacrificial Rites, doubtless giving rules for bloodless sacrifices; Divination by means of sand, Divination by means of eggs; on Temple-building (otherwise unknown); On the girding on of Sacred Robes; and On Stones, said to contain a chapter on the carving of precious stones entitled The Eighty Stones; a version of this work, of late date, survives. It treats of the properties of stones, precious and ordinary, and their uses in divination. The Orphic Hymns are also mentioned in Suidas‚Äô list, and a Theogony in 1200 verses, perhaps one of those versions which differed from the Rhapsodiae. There was also an Orphic Word-book, doubtless a glossary of the special terms used in the cult, some of which were strange because of their allegorical usage, others because of their antiquity; this also was said to have been in verse. Such was the list of works finally classed as Orphic writings, though it was known in early times that many of them were the works of Pythagoreans and other writers. Herodotus said of the so-called ‚ÄòOrphic and Bacchic rites‚Äô that they were actually ‚ÄòEgyptian and Pythagorean‚Äô; and Ion of Chios said that Pythagoras himself attributed some of his writings to Orpheus. Others, as has been said, regarded the earliest epics as the work of Onomacritus. The original Hymns were thought to have been composed by Orpheus, and written down, with emendations, by Musaeus. There were also other writers named Orpheus: to one, of Croton, said to be a contemporary and associate of Peisistratus, were attributed two epic poems: an Argonautica, and The Twelve- year Cycle (probably astrological); to another, Orpheus of Camarina, an epic Descent into Hades. These namesakes are probably inventions.\\" MythologyEarly life= Important sites in the life and travels of Orpheus According to ApollodorusSon of Oeagrus or Apollo and Calliope: Apollodorus 1.3.1. and a fragment of Pindar,Pindar, frag. 126, line 9, noted in Ker√©nyi 1959: 280. Orpheus' father was Oeagrus, a Thracian king, or, according to another version of the story, the god Apollo. His mother was (1) the muse Calliope, (2) her sister Polymnia,Scholia on Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica 1.23 with Asclepiades as the authority (3) a daughter of Pierus,In Pausanias, Graeciae Descriptio 9.30.4, the author claimed that \\"...

Strabo mentions that he lived in Pimpleia. According to the epic poem Argonautica, Pimpleia was the location of Oeagrus' and Calliope's wedding.The Argonautica, book I (ll. 23‚Äì34), \\"First then let us name Orpheus whom once Calliope bare, it is said, wedded to Thracian Oeagrus, near the Pimpleian height.\\" While living with his mother and her eight beautiful sisters in Parnassus, he met Apollo, who was courting the laughing muse Thalia. Apollo, as the god of music, gave Orpheus a golden lyre and taught him to play it.Hoopes And Evslin, The Greek Gods, , , 1995, p. 77: \\"His father was a Thracian king; his mother the muse Calliope. For a while he lived on Parnassus with his mother and his eight beautiful aunts and there met Apollo who was courting the laughing muse Thalia. Apollo was taken with Orpheus, gave him his little golden lyre and taught him to play. And his mother taught him to make verses for singing.\\" Orpheus' mother taught him to make verses for singing. He is also said to have studied in Egypt.Diodorus Siculus, 4.25.2‚Äì4. Orpheus is said to have established the worship of Hecate in Aegina.Pausanias, Description of Greece, Corinth, 2.30.1 [2]: \\"Of the gods, the Aeginetans worship most Hecate, in whose honor every year they celebrate mystic rites which, they say, Orpheus the Thracian established among them. Within the enclosure is a temple; its wooden image is the work of Myron, and it has one face and one body. It was Alcamenes, in my opinion, who first made three images of Hecate attached to one another, a figure called by the Athenians Epipurgidia (on the Tower); it stands beside the temple of the Wingless Victory.\\" In Laconia Orpheus is said to have brought the worship of Demeter ChthoniaPausanias, Description of Greece, Laconia, 3.14.1,[5]: \\"[‚Ä¶] but the wooden image of Thetis is guarded in secret. The cult of Demeter Chthonia (of the Lower World) the Lacedaemonians say was handed on to them by Orpheus, but in my opinion it was because of the sanctuary in Hermione that the Lacedaemonians also began to worship Demeter Chthonia. The Spartans have also a sanctuary of Serapis, the newest sanctuary in the city, and one of Zeus surnamed Olympian.\\" and that of the (; 'Saviour Maidens').Pausanias, Description of Greece, Laconia, 3.13.1: \\"Opposite the Olympian Aphrodite the Lacedaemonians have a temple of the Saviour Maid. Some say that it was made by Orpheus the Thracian, others by Abairis when he had come from the Hyperboreans.\\" Also in Taygetos a wooden image of Orpheus was said to have been kept by Pelasgians in the sanctuary of the Eleusinian Demeter.Pausanias, Description of Greece, Laconia, 3.20.1,[5]: \\"Between Taletum and Euoras is a place they name Therae, where they say Leto from the Peaks of Taygetus [‚Ä¶] is a sanctuary of Demeter surnamed Eleusinian. Here according to the Lacedaemonian story Heracles was hidden by Asclepius while he was being healed of a wound. In the sanctuary is a wooden image of Orpheus, a work, they say, of Pelasgians.\\" According to Diodorus Siculus, Musaeus of Athens was the son of Orpheus.Diodorus Siculus, 4.25.1-2. =Travelling as an Argonaut= The Argonautica () is a Greek epic poem written by Apollonius Rhodius in the 3rd century BC. Orpheus took part in this adventure and used his skills to aid his companions. Chiron told Jason that without the aid of Orpheus, the Argonauts would never be able to pass the Sirens‚Äîthe same Sirens encountered by Odysseus in Homer's epic poem the Odyssey. The Sirens lived on three small, rocky islands called Sirenum scopuli and sang beautiful songs that enticed sailors to come to them, which resulted in the crashing of their ships into the islands. When Orpheus heard their voices, he drew his lyre and played music that was louder and more beautiful, drowning out the Sirens' bewitching songs. According to 3rd century BC Hellenistic elegiac poet Phanocles, Orpheus loved the young Argonaut Calais, \\"the son of Boreas, with all his heart, and went often in shaded groves still singing of his desire, nor was his heart at rest. But always, sleepless cares wasted his spirits as he looked at fresh Calais.\\" =Death of Eurydice= Orpheus with the lyre and surrounded by beasts (Byzantine & Christian Museum, Athens) The most famous story in which Orpheus figures is that of his wife Eurydice (sometimes referred to as Euridice and also known as Argiope). While walking among her people, the Cicones, in tall grass at her wedding, Eurydice was set upon by a satyr. In her efforts to escape the satyr, Eurydice fell into a nest of vipers and suffered a fatal bite on her heel. Her body was discovered by Orpheus who, overcome with grief, played such sad and mournful songs that all the nymphs and gods wept. On their advice, Orpheus traveled to the underworld. His music softened the hearts of Hades and Persephone, who agreed to allow Eurydice to return with him to earth on one condition: he should walk in front of her and not look back until they both had reached the upper world. He set off with Eurydice following, and, in his doubt, as soon as he reached the upper world, he turned to look at her, forgetting that both needed to be in the upper world, and she vanished for the second time, but now forever. The story in this form belongs to the time of Virgil, who first introduces the name of Aristaeus (by the time of Virgil's Georgics, the myth has Aristaeus chasing Eurydice when she was bitten by a serpent) and the tragic outcome.M. Owen Lee, Virgil as Orpheus: A Study of the Georgics, State University of New York Press, Albany (1996), p. 9. Other ancient writers, however, speak of Orpheus' visit to the underworld in a more negative light; according to Phaedrus in Plato's Symposium,Symposium 179d. the infernal gods only \\"presented an apparition\\" of Eurydice to him. In fact, Plato's representation of Orpheus is that of a coward, as instead of choosing to die in order to be with the one he loved, he instead mocked the gods by trying to go to Hades to bring her back alive. Since his love was not \\"true\\"‚Äîhe did not want to die for love‚Äîhe was actually punished by the gods, first by giving him only the apparition of his former wife in the underworld, and then by being killed by women. In Ovid's account, however, Eurydice's death by a snake bite is incurred while she was dancing with naiads on her wedding day. Virgil wrote in his poem that Dryads wept from Epirus and Hebrus up to the land of the Getae (north east Danube valley) and even describes him wandering into Hyperborea and Tanais (ancient Greek city in the Don river delta) due to his grief. The story of Eurydice may actually be a late addition to the Orpheus myths. In particular, the name Eurudike (\\"she whose justice extends widely\\") recalls cult-titles attached to Persephone. According to the theories of poet Robert Graves, the myth may have been derived from another Orpheus legend, in which he travels to Tartarus and charms the goddess Hecate.Robert Graves, The Greek Myths, Penguin Books Ltd., London (1955), Volume 1, Chapter 28, \\"Orpheus\\", p. 115. The myth theme of not looking back, an essential precaution in Jason's raising of chthonic Brimo Hekate under Medea's guidance,Apollonius of Rhodes, Argonautica, book III: \\"Let no footfall or barking of dogs cause you to turn around, lest you ruin everything\\", Medea warns Jason; after the dread rite, \\"The son of Aison was seized by fear, but even so he did not turn round...\\" (Richard Hunter, translator). is reflected in the Biblical story of Lot's wife when escaping from Sodom. More directly, the story of Orpheus is similar to the ancient Greek tales of Persephone captured by Hades and similar stories of Adonis captive in the underworld. However, the developed form of the Orpheus myth was entwined with the Orphic mystery cults and, later in Rome, with the development of Mithraism and the cult of Sol Invictus. =Death= Thracian Girl Carrying the Head of Orpheus on His Lyre (1865) by Gustave Moreau The Death of Orpheus, detail from a silver 263x263px According to a Late Antique summary of Aeschylus' lost play Bassarids, Orpheus, towards the end of his life, disdained the worship of all gods except the sun, whom he called Apollo. One early morning he went to the oracle of Dionysus at Mount PangaionOrpheus and Greek Religion by William Keith Guthrie and L. Alderlink, , p. 32 to salute his god at dawn, but was ripped to shreds by Thracian Maenads for not honoring his previous patron (Dionysus) and buried in Pieria.Wilson, N., Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece, Routledge, 2013, , p. 702: \\"His grave and cult belong not to Thrace but to Pierian Macedonia, northeast of Mount Olympus, a region that the Thracians had once inhabited Here his death is analogous with that of Pentheus, who was also torn to pieces by Maenads; and it has been speculated that the Orphic mystery cult regarded Orpheus as a parallel figure to or even an incarnation of Dionysus.Classical Mythology, p. 279, Mark P. O. Morford, Robert J. Lenardon. Both made similar journeys into Hades, and Dionysus Zagreus suffered an identical death.Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, volume 88, p. 211 Pausanias writes that Orpheus was buried in Dion and that he met his death there.Pausanias, Description of Greece, Boeotia, 9.30.1. The Macedonians who dwell in the district below Mount Pieria and the city of Dium say that it was here that Orpheus met his end at the hands of the women. Going from Dium along the road to the mountain, and advancing twenty stades, you come to a pillar on the right surmounted by a stone urn, which according to the natives contains the bones of Orpheus. He writes that the river Helicon sank underground when the women that killed Orpheus tried to wash off their blood-stained hands in its waters.Pausanias, Description of Greece, Boeotia, 9.30.1. There is also a river called Helicon. After a course of seventy-five stades the stream hereupon disappears under the earth. After a gap of about twenty-two stades the water rises again, and under the name of Baphyra instead of Helicon flows into the sea as a navigable river. The people of Dium say that at first this river flowed on land throughout its course. But, they go on to say, the women who killed Orpheus wished to wash off in it the blood-stains, and thereat the river sank underground, so as not to lend its waters to cleanse manslaughter Other legends claim that Orpheus became a follower of Dionysus and spread his cult across the land. In this version of the legend, it is said that Orpheus was torn to shreds by the women of Thrace for his inattention. Ovid recounts that Orpheus ... Feeling spurned by Orpheus for taking only male lovers (eromenoi), the Ciconian women, followers of Dionysus, \\"by the Ciconian women.\\" first threw sticks and stones at him as he played, but his music was so beautiful even the rocks and branches refused to hit him. Enraged, the women tore him to pieces during the frenzy of their Bacchic orgies. Book XI. In Albrecht D√ºrer's drawing of Orpheus' death, based on an original, now lost, by Andrea Mantegna, a ribbon high in the tree above him is lettered Orfeus der erst puseran (\\"Orpheus, the first pederast\\"). D√ºrer His head and lyre, still singing mournful songs, floated down the River Hebrus into the sea, after which the winds and waves carried them to the island of Lesbos,Carlos Parada \\"His head fell into the sea and was cast by the waves upon the island of Lesbos where the Lesbians buried it, and for having done this the Lesbians have the reputation of being skilled in music.\\" at the city of Methymna; there, the inhabitants buried his head and a shrine was built in his honour near Antissa;Recently a cave was identified as the oracle of Orpheus nearby the modern village of Antissa; see Harissis H. V. et al. \\"The Spelios of Antissa; The oracle of Orpheus in Lesvos\\" Archaiologia kai Technes 2002; 83:68‚Äì73 (article in Greek with English abstract) there his oracle prophesied, until it was silenced by Apollo.Flavius Philostratus, Life of Apollonius of Tyana, In addition to the people of Lesbos, Greeks from Ionia and Aetolia consulted the oracle, and his reputation spread as far as Babylon. Cave of Orpheus' oracle in Antissa, Lesbos Orpheus' lyre was carried to heaven by the Muses, and was placed among the stars. The Muses also gathered up the fragments of his body and buried them at LeibethraThe Writing of Orpheus: Greek Myth in Cultural Context by Marcele Detienne, , p. 161 below Mount Olympus, where the nightingales sang over his grave. After the river Sys floodedPausanias, Description of Greece, Boeotia, 9.30.1 [11] Immediately when night came the god sent heavy rain, and the river Sys (Boar), one of the torrents about Olympus, on this occasion threw down the walls of Libethra, overturning sanctuaries of gods and houses of men, and drowning the inhabitants and all the animals in the city. When Libethra was now a city of ruin, the Macedonians in Dium, according to my friend of Larisa, carried the bones of Orpheus to their own country. Leibethra, the Macedonians took his bones to Dion. Orpheus' soul returned to the underworld, to the fields of the Blessed, where he was reunited at last with his beloved Eurydice. Another legend places his tomb at Dion, near Pydna in Macedon. In another version of the myth, Orpheus travels to Aornum in Thesprotia, Epirus to an old oracle for the dead. In the end Orpheus commits suicide from his grief unable to find Eurydice.Others have said that his wife died before him, and that for her sake he came to Aornum in Thesprotis, where of old was an oracle of the dead. He thought, they say, that the soul of Eurydice followed him, but turning round he lost her, and committed suicide for grief. The Thracians say that such nightingales as nest on the grave of Orpheus sing more sweetly and louder than others.Pausanias, Description of Greece, Boeotia, 9.30.1. \\"Others said that he was the victim of a thunderbolt.\\" Orphic poems and rites Nymphs Finding the Head of Orpheus (1900) by John William Waterhouse A number of Greek religious poems in hexameters were attributed to Orpheus, as they were to similar miracle-working figures, like Bakis, Musaeus, Abaris, Aristeas, Epimenides, and the Sibyl. Of this vast literature, only two works survived whole: the Orphic Hymns, a set of 87 poems, possibly composed at some point in the second or third century, and the epic poem Argonautica, composed somewhere between the fourth and sixth centuries. Earlier Orphic literature, which may date back as far as the sixth century BC, survives only in papyrus fragments or in quotations. Some of the earliest fragments may have been composed by Onomacritus.Freeman, Kathleen. Ancilla to the Pre-Socratic Philosophers, Harvard University Press (1948), p. 1. Nymphs Listening to the Songs of Orpheus (1853) by Charles Jalabert In addition to serving as a storehouse of mythological data along the lines of Hesiod's Theogony, Orphic poetry was recited in mystery-rites and purification rituals. Plato in particular tells of a class of vagrant beggar-priests who would go about offering purifications to the rich, a clatter of books by Orpheus and Musaeus in tow.Plato. The Republic 364c‚Äìd. Those who were especially devoted to these rituals and poems often practiced vegetarianism and abstention from sex, and refrained from eating eggs and beans ‚Äî which came to be known as the Orphikos bios, or \\"Orphic way of life\\".Moore, p. 56: \\"the use of eggs and beans was forbidden, for these articles were associated with the worship of the dead\\". The Derveni papyrus, found in Derveni, Macedonia (Greece) in 1962, contains a philosophical treatise that is an allegorical commentary on an Orphic poem in hexameters, a theogony concerning the birth of the gods, produced in the circle of the philosopher Anaxagoras, written in the second half of the fifth century BC. Fragments of the poem are quoted making it \\"the most important new piece of evidence about Greek philosophy and religion to come to light since the Renaissance\\". The papyrus dates to around 340 BC, during the reign of Philip II of Macedon, making it Europe's oldest surviving manuscript. The historian William Mitford wrote in 1784 that the very earliest form of a higher and more cohesive ancient Greek religion was manifest in the Orphic poems.Mitford, p. 89: \\"But the very early inhabitants of Greece had a religion far less degenerated from original purity. To this curious and interesting fact, abundant testimonies remain. They occur in those poems, of uncertain origin and uncertain date, but unquestionably of great antiquity, which are called the poems of Orpheus or rather the Orphic poems [Note: Particularly in the Hymn to Jupiter, quoted by Aristotle in the seventh chapter of his Treatise on the World]; and they are found scattered among the writings of the philosophers and historians.\\" The idea of a religion \\"degenerated from original purity\\" expressed an Enlightenment idealisation of an assumed primitive state that is one connotation of \\"primitivism\\" in the history of ideas. W. K. C. Guthrie wrote that Orpheus was the founder of mystery religions and the first to reveal to men the meanings of the initiation rites.Guthrie, pp. 17‚Äì18. \\"As founder of mystery-religions, Orpheus was first to reveal to men the meaning of the rites of initiation (teletai). We read of this in both Plato and Aristophanes (Aristophanes, Frogs, 1032; Plato, Republic, 364e, a passage which suggests that literary authority was made to take the responsibility for the rites)\\". Guthrie goes on to write about \\"This less worthy but certainly popular side of Orphism is represented for us again by the charms or incantations of Orpheus which we may also read of as early as the fifth century. Our authority is Euripides. We have already noticed the 'charm on the Thracian tablets' in the Alcestis and in Cyclops one of the lazy and frightened Satyrs, unwilling to help Odysseus in the task of driving the burning stake into the single eye of the giant, exclaims: 'But I know a spell of Orpheus, a fine one, which will make the brand step up of its own accord to burn this one-eyed son of Earth' (Euripides, Cyclops 646 = Kern, test. 83).\\" Post-Classical interpretationsClassical music= The Orpheus motif has permeated Western culture and has been used as a theme in all art forms. Early examples include the Breton lai Sir Orfeo from the early 13th century and musical interpretations like Jacapo Peri's Euridice (1600, though titled with his wife's name, the libretto is based entirely upon books X and XI of Ovid's Metamorphoses and therefore Orpheus' viewpoint is predominant). Subsequent operatic interpretations include Claudio Monteverdi's L'Orfeo (1607), Luigi Rossi's L'Orfeo (1647), Marc-Antoine Charpentier's La descente d'Orph√©e aux enfers H 488, 1686 (he wrote also a cantata, Orph√©e descendant aux enfers H 471, 1683), Christoph Willibald Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice (1762), Joseph Haydn's last opera L'anima del filosofo, ossia Orfeo ed Euridice (1791), Franz Liszt's symphonic poem Orpheus (1854), Igor Stravinsky's ballet Orpheus (1948) and two operas by Harrison Birtwistle: The Mask of Orpheus (1973‚Äì1984) and The Corridor (2009). The Bulgarian Rousse State Opera commissioned and performed Orpheus: A Masque by John Robertson (2015).Rousse State Opera. \\"–°–≤–µ—Ç–æ–≤–Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–µ–º–∏–µ—Ä–∞ –Ω–∞ –æ–ø–µ—Ä–∞—Ç–∞ ‚Äû–û—Ä—Ñ–µ–π‚Äù –æ—Ç –∫–∞–Ω–∞–¥—Å–∫–∏—è –∫–æ–º–ø–æ–∑–∏—Ç–æ—Ä –î–∂–æ–Ω –†–æ–±—ä—Ä—Ç—Å—ä–Ω –≤ –ú–§ ‚Äû–°—Ü–µ–Ω–∞ –∫—Ä–∞–π —Ä–µ–∫–∞—Ç–∞‚Äù-–†—É—Å–µ\\" (\\"World Premiere of the opera \\"Orpheus\\" by Canadian composer John Robertson\\"). Retrieved 22 February 2016 . =Literature= Rainer Maria Rilke's Sonnets to Orpheus (1922) are based on the Orpheus myth. Poul Anderson's Hugo Award-winning novelette \\"Goat Song\\", published in 1972, is a retelling of the story of Orpheus in a science fiction setting. Some feminist interpretations of the myth give Eurydice greater weight. Margaret Atwood's Orpheus and Eurydice Cycle (1976‚Äì86) deals with the myth, and gives Eurydice a more prominent voice. Sarah Ruhl's Eurydice likewise presents the story of Orpheus' descent to the underworld from Eurydice's perspective. Ruhl removes Orpheus from the center of the story by pairing their romantic love with the paternal love of Eurydice's dead father. David Almond's 2014 novel, A Song for Ella Grey, was inspired by the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, and won the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize in 2015.https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/nov/19/david- almond-wins-guardian-childrens-fiction-prize The 2014 novel Orfeo by Richard Powers is based on Orpheus. Dino Buzzati adapted the Orpheus motif in his graphic novel Poem Strip (1969). Neil Gaiman depicts his version of Orpheus in The Sandman comics series (1989‚Äì2015). Gaiman's Orpheus is the son of Oneiros (the Dream Lord Morpheus) and the muse Calliope.Gaiman, Neil. The Sandman #50. The poet Gabriele Tinti has composed a series of poems inspired by the myth of Orpheus, read by Robert Davi at the J. Paul Getty Museumhttps://soundcloud.com/the-getty/robertdavi-orpheus =Film and stage= Death of Orpheus by Mexican artist Antonio Garc√≠a Vega Vinicius de Moraes' play Orfeu da Concei√ß√£o (1956), later adapted by Marcel Camus in the 1959 film Black Orpheus, tells the story in the modern context of a favela in Rio de Janeiro during Carnaval. Jean Cocteau's Orphic Trilogy ‚Äì The Blood of a Poet (1930), Orpheus (1950) and Testament of Orpheus (1959) ‚Äì was filmed over thirty years, and is based in many ways on the story. Philip Glass adapted the second film into the chamber opera Orph√©e (1991), part of an homage triptych to Cocteau. Nikos Nikolaidis' 1975 film Evrydiki BA 2O37 is an innovative perspective on the classic Greek tragedy of Orpheus and Eurydice. Ana√Øs Mitchell's 2010 folk opera musical Hadestown retells the tragedy of Orpheus and Eurydice with a soundtrack inspired by American blues and jazz, portraying Hades as the brutal work-boss of an underground mining city. Mitchell, together with director Rachel Chavkin, later adapted her album into a multiple Tony award winning stage musical. =Popular Music= Australian band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds released their critically acclaimed double album Abbatoir Blues / the Lyre of Orpheus in 2004 =Reception= Because of the pervasiveness of the Orpheus myth, many interpretations are in conversation with previous interpretations as well: Pina Bausch's dance-opera Orpheus und Euridike displays original choreography set to Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice. Baz Luhrmann, in DVD commentaries for his 2001 film Moulin Rouge!, characterizes the film as, in part, a tale of an Orphic hero (in this case a songwriter) who embarks upon a visit to the underworld (in this case the demi-monde around Paris' Montmartre) in search of his fortune and ultimately to attempt the rescue of his doomed love. The film adapts a widely known piece from Jacques Offenbach's comedic operetta Orph√©e aux enfers (Orpheus in the Underworld), identified with the once-popular can-can music hall dance. Offenbach's operatic work had itself parodied the classical tale of Orpheus' attempted rescue of Eurydice from Pluto (Hades). Gavin Bryars' music for √âdouard Lock's full length ballet Dido and Orfeo (2011) reworks music from the operas Dido and Aeneas (Purcell) and Orfeo ed Euridice (Gluck) for a small ensemble of saxophone, viola, cello and piano. In 2019, Sara Bareilles released her sixth studio album Amidst the Chaos which features a song titled \\"Orpheus\\".

It won a production contract, but this was transferred to the same company's monoplane equivalent, the Wellesley. Only one Type 253 was built. Development In April 1932 the Air Ministry awarded a contract to Vickers for a single prototype aircraft under Air Ministry specification G.4/31 for a Westland Wapiti replacement, a multi-role aircraft capable of carrying out level bombing, army co-operation, dive bombing, reconnaissance, casualty evacuation and torpedo bombing. Vickers' entrant to this competition was the Type 253, though often known by the specification as the Vickers G.4/31. The Ministry had also ordered prototypes of other designs and some manufacturers had offered private ventures (aircraft built with their own money). The Type 253 was in competition with the Handley Page HP.47. Fairey G.4/31, Westland PV.7, Armstrong Whitworth A.W.19, Blackburn B-7, Hawker P.V.4 and the Parnall G.4/31. The Ministry preferred an air-cooled engine, and Vickers' choice was the radial Bristol Pegasus. The Vickers Type 253 used a Pegasus IIM3 engine, enclosed by a drag-reducing Townend ring, to power a two-bay, unstaggered biplane, with a lower wing smaller in span and chord. Both wings were of constant chord, but the centre sections were mildly forward-swept and the lower centre section carried anhedral out to the inner interplane struts. Both sets of interplane struts leaned outwards, the outer ones more so. Both wings carried ailerons and the upper planes had leading edge slats. The wings joined the fuselage top and bottom with no gap, the pilot sitting just ahead of the leading edge in an open cockpit and the observer sitting well behind the trailing edge. A conventional tail carried balanced rudder and elevators. The split-axle fixed undercarriage was neatly mounted, the main legs fixed to the front spar under the inner interplane struts and braced rearwards to the wing roots. Construction was the common one of canvas over a metal frame, but the fuselage frame was quite novel. It was designed by Vickers' chief structural engineer, Barnes Wallis and was a step along the road to his geodetic frames, where the distinction between main and secondary members was largely lost. The Type 207 fuselage frame had four light-alloy longerons, each made in sections that were screwed together. These longerons were joined by a pair of oppositely handed helical channel members, forming a diagonal tubular mesh. Wing construction was less radical, and indeed less novel than that of the earlier Type 207, which had thick RAF34 section wings built of complex webbing informed by Wallis' earlier airship experience; the Type 253 reverted to the thinner RAF15 section and a more familiar two spar design. Mutt Summers took the Type 253 on its first flight on 16 August 1934 at Brooklands. It then went, after some modifications to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at Martlesham Heath for trials in the specification competition. In February 1935 the sole 253 flew with an uprated Pegasus IIIM3. The Type 253 won the competition and an order for 150 aircraft. However, on 19 June 1935, Summers flew the Type 246 monoplane that Vickers had built to the same specification as a private venture, which was to become the prototype Type 287 Wellesley. It was immediately apparent that the monoplane offered better performance and a greater payload, so the Type 253 order was cancelled and replaced with one for the Wellesley in September 1935.

Until 29 October 2009 it remained one of only two weekly papers in the United Kingdom that continued to have a front page consisting wholly of advertisements. On 22 October 2009 it was announced that the edition on 29 October 2009 would be the last broadsheet edition with adverts on the front cover. From 5 November 2009 the format was changed to a tabloid size, or compact as the then-editor described it, with news on page one and the adverts moved to page two. History There have been several newspapers covering the Craven area. The Craven Herald was first published in 1853, in Skipton, by Robert Tasker, a local printer. Originally a monthly publication, it ran until 1868 when Tasker became postmaster of Skipton and, as such, was debarred from publishing a newspaper. In 1865 the Craven Weekly Pioneer and General Advertiser for West Yorkshire and East Lancashire was launched. This was a paper of very liberal leanings being an enthusiastic supporter of William Ewart Gladstone. In response the local Conservatives bought Tasker's firm and in 1875 re-launched the Craven Herald. Both papers continued to publish separately and both underwent name changes at various times. The Craven Herald changed its name to the Craven Herald and Wensleydale Standard in 1868 before reverting to the Craven Herald in 1922. Meanwhile the Pioneer became the West Yorkshire Pioneer and East Lancashire News in 1884 and the West Yorkshire Pioneer in 1934. The two rivals merged in 1937 to form the Craven Herald & Pioneer. The Craven Herald was an early user of photographs in the paper. The first example, of a society wedding, appeared in 1905. In 1987, financial pressures forced the owners of the paper to sell to Westminster Press, the publishers of the Bradford Telegraph and Argus. Westminster Press itself was sold to Newsquest in 1996. Until 1995 the paper was printed in Skipton but after a Westminster Press decision to centralise printing, moved to Bradford, although the editorial and advertising offices remain in Skipton. In 2001 the paper broke with its tradition and suspended adverts on the front page for one edition to use a photograph to report the arrival of foot and mouth disease in Craven. While it remained a broadsheet publication, the front page remained resolutely advertising although in 2008 changes were made to preview the main news story in a 12 column inch (3 inches by 4 columns) box on the front page. Current status In the January ‚Äì December 2013 ABC audit, the average net circulation per issue was 11,498. By the January to December 2016 season, this had dropped to 9,377 average weekly circulation. The present editor is Andrew Hitchon. Styling itself The Voice of the Dales since 1853 it is now published every Thursday and carries some colour photographs on the inside. the cover price is ¬£1. From 5 November 2009 the paper is printed in a tabloid format with news on the front page and the adverts formerly carried on page one moved to page two.

During the Nanjing decade (1927‚Äì1937), China advanced in a number of industrial sectors, in particular those related to the military, in an effort to catch up with the west and prepare for war with Japan. The Second Sino-Japanese War (1937‚Äì1945) and the following Chinese civil war caused the retreat of the Republic of China and formation of the People's Republic of China.Sun Jian, pp. 616‚Äì18 yuan in Chinese), issued for the first time in 1914, became a dominant coin type of the Republic of China. A bill from 1930, early ROC The Republican era was a period of turmoil. From 1913 to 1927, China disintegrated into regional warlords, fighting for authority, causing misery and disrupting growth. After 1927, Chiang Kai-shek managed to reunify China. The Nanjing decade was a period of relative prosperity despite civil war and Japanese aggression. The government began to stabilize tax collection, establish a national budget, sponsor the construction of infrastructure such as communications and railroads, and draw up ambitious national plans, some of which were implemented after 1949. In 1937, the Japanese invaded and laid China to waste in eight years of war. The era also saw boycott of Japanese products. After 1945, the Chinese civil war further devastated China and led to the withdrawal of the Nationalist government to Taiwan in 1949. Yet the economist Gregory Chow summarizes recent scholarship when he concludes that \\"in spite of political instability, economic activities carried on and economic development took place between 1911 and 1937,\\" and in short, \\"modernization was taking place.\\" Up until 1937, he continues, China had a market economy which was \\"performing well\\", which explains why China was capable of returning to a market economy after economic reform started in 1978.Gregory C. Chow, China's Economic Transformation (2nd ed. 2007) excerpt and text search pp. 20‚Äì21. There have been two major competing interpretations (traditionalist vs revisionist) among scholars who have studied China's economy in the late Qing and Republican period. The traditionalists (mainly historians like Lloyd Eastman, Joseph Esherick and others) view China's economic performance from the early 19th to the middle 20th century as abysmal. They view the traditional economic and political system during the late Qing and Republican periods as being unable to respond to the pressures of the West and inhibiting economic growth. These scholars stress the turning point in 1949 when the PRC is founded as acting as allowing for the political and economic revolution required that led to fast economic growth. The revisionists (mainly economists like Thomas Rawski, Loren Brandt and others) view the traditional economy as mostly successful with slow but steady growth in GDP per capita after the late 19th century. These scholars focus on the continuity of between features of the traditional economy and the PRC economy with its rapid growth. They believe that the PRC built upon the favourable conditions that existed during the Republican and late Qing periods, which allowed for the fast economic growth of the period. Civil war, famine and turmoil in the early republic The early republic was marked by frequent wars and factional struggles. Following the presidency of Yuan Shikai to 1927, famine, war and change of government was the norm in Chinese politics, with provinces periodically declaring \\"independence\\". The collapse of central authority caused the economic contraction that was in place since Qing to speed up, and was only reversed when Chiang reunified China in 1927 and proclaimed himself its leader.Sun Jian, pp. 613‚Äì14 Development of domesticated industries Boat traffic and development along Suzhou Creek, Shanghai, around 1920 Chinese domestic industries developed rapidly after the downfall of the Qing dynasty, despite turmoil in Chinese politics. Development of these industries peaked during World War I, which saw a great increase in demand for Chinese goods, which benefitted China's industries. In addition, imports to China fell drastically after total war broke out in Europe. For example, China's textile industry had 482,192 needle machines in 1913, while by 1918 (the end of the war) that number had gone up to 647,570. The number increased even faster to 1,248,282 by 1921. In addition, bread factories went up from 57 to 131.Sun Jian, pp. 894‚Äì95 The May 4th movement, in which Chinese students called China's population to boycott foreign goods, also helped spur development. Foreign imports fell drastically from 1919‚Äì1921 and from 1925 to 1927.Sun Jian, p. 897 Chinese industries continue to develop in the 1930s with the advent of the Nanking decade in the 1930s, when Chiang Kai-shek unified most of the country and brought political stability. China's industries developed and grew from 1927 to 1931. Though badly hit by the Great Depression from 1931 to 1935 and Japan's occupation of Manchuria in 1931, industrial output recovered by 1936. By 1936, industrial output had recovered and surpassed its previous peak in 1931 prior to the Great Depression's effects on China. This is best shown by the trends in Chinese GDP. In 1932, China's GDP peaked at 28.8 billion, before falling to 21.3 billion by 1934 and recovering to 23.7 billion by 1935.Sun Jian, pp. 1059‚Äì71 The rural economy of the Republic of China The rural economy retained much of the characteristics of the Late Qing. While markets had been forming since the Song and Ming dynasties, Chinese agriculture by the Republic of China was almost completely geared towards producing cash crops for foreign consumption, and was thus subject to the say of the international markets. Key exports included glue, tea, silk, sugar cane, tobacco, cotton, corn and peanuts.Sun Jian, pp. 934‚Äì35 The rural economy was hit hard by the Great Depression of the 1930s, in which an overproduction of agricultural goods lead to massive falling prices for China as well as an increase in foreign imports (as agricultural goods produced in western countries were \\"dumped\\" in China). In 1931, imports of rice in China amounted to 21 million bushels compared with 12 million in 1928. Other goods saw even more staggering increases. In 1932, 15 million bushels of grain were imported compared with 900,000 in 1928.Sun Jian, p. 1088 This increased competition lead to a massive decline in Chinese agricultural prices (which were cheaper) and thus the income of rural farmers. In 1932, agricultural prices were 41 percent of 1921 levels.Sun Jian, p. 1089 Rural incomes had fallen to 57 percent of 1931 levels by 1934 in some areas. Foreign direct investment in the Republic of China Foreign direct investment in China soared during the Republic of China. Some 1.5 billion of investment was present in China by the beginning of the 20th century, with Russia, The United Kingdom and Germany being the largest investors. However, with the outbreak of World War I, investment from Germany and Russia stopped while England and Japan took a leading role. By 1930, foreign investment in China was more than 3.5 billion, with Japan leading (1.4 billion) and England at 1 billion. By 1948, however, the capital stock had halted with investment dropping to only 3 billion, with the US and Britain leading.Sun Jian, p. 1353 Currency of the Republic of China The currency of China was initially silver-backed, but the nationalist government seized control of private banks in the notorious banking coup of 1935 and replaced the currency with the Fabi, a fiat currency issued by the ROC. Particular effort was made by the ROC government to instill this currency as the monopoly currency of China, stamping out earlier Silver and gold-backed notes that had made up China's currency. Unfortunately, the ROC government used this privilege to issue currency en masse; a total of 1.4 billion Chinese yuan was issued in 1936, but by the end of the second Sino- Japanese war some 1.031 trillion in notes was issued.Sun Jian, pp. 1234‚Äì36 This trend worsened with the outbreak of the Chinese Civil war in 1946. By 1947, some 33.2 trillion of currency was issued as a result of massive budget deficits resulting from war (taxation revenue was just 0.25 billion, compared with 2500 billion in war expenses). By 1949, the total currency in circulation was 120 billion times more than in 1936.Sun Jian, p. 1317 The Chinese war economy (1937‚Äì1945) Coal mining at Fushun, Liaoning, c. 1940, operating under the control of the Japanese In 1937, Japan invaded China and the resulting warfare laid waste to China. Most of the prosperous east China coast was occupied by the Japanese, who carried out atrocities such as the Rape of Nanjing in 1937 and random massacres of whole villages. The Japanese carried out systematic bombing of Chinese cities, and the Nationalist armies followed a \\"scorched earth\\" policy of destroying the productive capacity of the areas they had to abandon to the Japanese. In one Japanese anti-guerilla sweep in 1942, the Japanese killed up to 200,000 civilians in a month. 2‚Äì3 million civilians died in a famine in Henan in 1942 and 1943. Overall the war is estimated to have killed between 20 and 25 million Chinese. It severely set back the development of the preceding decade.Sun Jian, pp. 615‚Äì16. Industry was severely hampered after the war by devastating conflict as well as the inflow of cheap American goods. By 1946, Chinese industries operated at 20% capacity and had 25% of the output of pre-war China.Sun Jian, p. 1319. The war brought about a massive increase in government control of industries. In 1936, government-owned industries were only 15% of GDP. However, the ROC government took control of many industries in order to fight the war. In 1938, the ROC established a commission for industries and mines to control and supervise firms, as well as instilling price controls. By 1942, 70% of the capital of Chinese industry were owned by the government.Sun Jian, pp. 1237‚Äì40. Hyperinflation, civil war and the relocation of the republic to Taiwan Following the war with Japan, Chiang acquired Taiwan from Japan and renewed his struggle with the communists. However, the corruption of the KMT, as well as hyperinflation as a result of trying to fight the civil war, resulted in mass unrest throughout the RepublicSun Jian, pp. 617‚Äì18 and sympathy for the communists. In addition, the communists' promise to redistribute land gained them support among the massive rural population. In 1949, the communists captured Beijing and later Nanjing as well. The People's Republic of China was proclaimed on 1 October 1949. The Republic of China relocated to Taiwan where Japan had laid an educational groundwork. Taiwan continued to prosper under the Republic of China government and came to be known as one of the Four Asian Tigers due to its \\"economic miracle\\", and later became one of the largest sources of investment in mainland China after the PRC economy began its rapid growth following Deng's reforms.Top 10 Origins of FDI US-China Business Council, February 2007 See also *Economic history of China (1949‚Äìpresent) *Economic history of China before 1912 *Economy of China *Economy of Hong Kong *Economy of Macau *Economy of Taiwan *Economy of the Han dynasty *Economy of the Ming dynasty *Economy of the Song dynasty ReferencesBibliography and further reading * Chow, Gregory C.

He was educated at the High School of Dundee and Edinburgh University where he graduated with MA and LL.B degrees. He received a distinction in law and was awarded the Forensic Prize as the most distinguished law graduate of his year. In 1901, he married Agnes Catherine (\\"Kate\\") Mackay from Midlothian. They had two sons and two daughters.Who was Who, OUP 2007 Career Anderson was called to the Scottish bar in 1889 and established a large practice as an advocate particularly in jury cases.The Times, 29 May 1936 p19 He was made an Advocate Depute in 1906The Times, 15 December 1910 p7 and took silk in 1908.Scottish Law Review and Sheriff Court Reports, Volume 24; William Hodge and Co., 1908 p307 From December 1911 to October 1913 he held the post of Solicitor General for Scotland.

Politics1906= Anderson was selected as Liberal candidate for North Ayrshire in December 1905The Times,26 December 1905 to contest the 1906 general election. He faced the sitting Unionist MP, Thomas Cochrane. At the previous general election in 1900, there had been a straight fight between Unionist and Liberal candidates but in 1906 Labour also stood a candidate, James Brown. This had the effect of splitting the anti-Unionist vote and Cochrane held his seat with a majority of 1,016 votes over Anderson.The Times, 29 January 1906 p10 =1910= Anderson fought in Ayrshire North again at the general election of January 1910.

In accordance with the constitutional arrangements of the day, he was obliged to resign as an MP and fight a by-election. The contest, which took place on 20 December 1911, was dominated by the government's legislation on National Insurance and the uncertainties this legislation would produce for individual electors, particularly those of small manufacturers and shopkeepers. Although there was no Labour candidate, Anderson was thought to have lost some support among working-class voters because of his opposition to Labour candidates in other recent elections.The Times, 20 December 1911 p10 Anderson's Unionist opponent was again Duncan Campbell. After another tight contest, Campbell recaptured the seat for the Tories by a majority of 271 votes.The Times, 22 December 1911 p6 After six years of Liberal government, the electors of North Ayrshire reverted to their more traditional allegiances, perhaps rebelling against the background of the rapid social changes being introduced by H H Asquith's reforming administration.The Times, 22 December 1911 p7 After the election, Anderson agreed to be re-adopted as prospective Liberal candidate for North Ayrshire, expressing a wish to contest the seat again.The Times, 23 January 1912 p7 However the seat disappeared in boundary changes for the 1918 general election and Anderson did not contest any of the successor seats. He did not stand for the House of Commons again. =Other appointments and honours= Anderson was sometime Deputy Lieutenant for the County of the City of Edinburgh.

The highest peak is above sea level. The 9,270 acre tract is owned by the Texas State University System and is open to the public and to academic researchers studying the area's natural resources. The area's shallow, stony soils support oak, juniper, mesquite, chaparral, various cacti, and grasses. The Richard K. Mellon Foundation, through the Conservation Fund, donated the Christmas Mountains to the State of Texas in 1991 for use as or inclusion in a nature park, wildlife refuge, recreational area or similarly designated use area. The land was put up for auction in 2007 by State Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson because the property was too difficult to maintain. Poaching and invasive species of plants were degrading the area and the state did not want to provide the money to maintain the vast tract. The gift deed required the Conservation Fund's approval before conveying the property to any party other than the federal or state parks agencies. Patterson, however, decided the provision was not enforceable. The winning bid was $652,000 ($70/acre), but the sale was canceled on September 18, 2007 after the state said a property map was inaccurate. The National Park Service offered to take the property and incorporate it into Big Bend National Park. Patterson blocked that option because hunting is not allowed in National Parks, and he desired to maintain hunting rights on the property. However, under intense public pressure, the sale of the land was delayed to give the Park Service time to make a bid. Eventually Patterson backed off his stance and indicated he might allow the transaction to proceed. Also, an amendment to the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009 lifted the prohibition on firearms in National Parks, which may further reduce barriers to the Christmas Mountains becoming part of the National Park System. In September 2011, the Texas General Land Office announced it was turning over control of the Christmas Mountains to the Texas State University System to conserve and use as an outdoor wilderness classroom and laboratory. Hunting is allowed in the Christmas Mountains.

It is located off Steamboat Landing Road Extension (South Carolina State Highway 10-768) close to Steamboat Creek about from Steam Boat Landing. It was named to the National Register of Historic Places on May 6, 1971. History William Seabrook was a Sea Island cotton planter and part-owner of the Edisto Island Ferry, which had a steamboat named the W. Seabrook. The house was built around 1810. His initials are on the ironwork of the front stairs. Tradition indicates that James Hoban, the architect of the White House, was the designer. William Seabrook died in about 1837. His widow lived in the house until 1854 or 1855. The house was purchased by J. Evans Eddings. At the end of the Civil War, the Sea Islands below Charleston were abandoned to the Union Army forces. The house was used for staff headquarters and provost. After the war ended, freed slaves temporarily took refuge in the house. Around 1875 it was sold. At some point, Judge Smith purchased the house. Later, the house was bought and restored by Donald D. Dodge. Architecture This house has been described as a classic plan for houses on Edisto. It is an Early Republic or Federal style, -story frame house on a raised basement. It has a gabled roof with dormers. It has a double portico with pediment with a semielliptical fanlight, columns, and arched entablature. Double stairways rise to the first floor portico. The main door has sidelights and a semielliptical fanlight. The windows on the main and second floors are nine over nine lights. The house originally had four rooms on the main floor divided by a central hall that extends to the smaller garden portico. Double stairways to the second floor go up a landing over the garden portico door. Additional pictures are available. A floor plan and photographs taken before its restoration are also available.

Roller burnishing is a surface finishing technique where hardened rollers cold work surface imperfections to reduce surface roughness. Roller burnishing differs from abrasive surface finishing techniques in that material is displaced rather than removed. The tooling typically consists of a hardened sphere or cylindrical roller. The tooling is pressed into the surface of the part while it is rotated (in some applications, the tools are rotated instead of the part). The burnishing tool rolls against the surface of the part at a constant speed, producing a very consistent finish across the part. A surface finish of less than Ra 0.1 ¬µm is achievable with roller burnishing. A side effect is that the outer surface of the part is work hardened. Roller burnishing is used in the production of some crankshafts. A dual roller (cylindrical) tool is moved into the thrust bearing journal of a crankshaft, while the crankshaft is spinning the tool is indexed (so each roller is perpendicular to the thrust surface while backing each other up) deforming the surfaces. So the diameters of each roller added together (compensated for elastic deformation) equals the finish dimension of the thrust bearing. In deep hole machining, a roller burnishing tool is often combined with skiving knives on the same tool. The skiving knives pass first, scraping the inside layer of metal, followed by the burnishing rollers, which cold work the tube to create a mirror surface finish. Skive-burnishing is often used in hydraulic cylinder applications. This process can happen on a deep hole drilling machine or a dedicated skiving machine.

Its official borders are R Street to the north, W-X Freeway to the south, I-5 to the west, and 12th Street to the east. Southside Park is part of the City of Sacramento's South Side Historic District. A large park with a natural pond sits at the center of the community. The park hosts several annual celebrations and the popular Sunday Farmers Market is held all year south of the park under the overpass at W-X Streets. HistoryNative inhabitants= The area was originally inhabited by the Valley Nisenan people for several thousand years. What is now Southside Park Lake was then a larger marshy pond that extended further south toward what is now Broadway and further north toward R Street. Nearby high ground would have been their preferred sites for their towns, which were scattered throughout. One of the largest ones, Sama, was a little south of here and was home to several hundred or perhaps over 1000 people. It was also their southernmost town; further south was Miwok land. The Nisenan were decimated (though not eliminated) by new diseases and hostility from the influx of outsiders in the 1800s. =Settlement= The area around what is now the park is a natural low spot (lowest in what is now the Central City) and was subject to seasonal flooding. As such, development in the growing City of Sacramento was at first confined to north of the R Street levee, and a sewage canal ran along 6th Street south of R starting in 1864. Later, construction of a levee at Y Street (now Broadway) made it possible to build south of R Street. So, the neighborhood began to be established around the turn of the 20th Century. Many residents worked at the nearby railyards, canneries, and lumber yards. The population included Portuguese, Japanese, Italians, Slavs, Africans, and others; non-whites were not allowed to live in certain other parts of the city until the late 1960s. In fact, the Fong Mansion across from the park's playground at 6th & U was built in 1936 by a Chinese diplomat who was not allowed to build where he originally wanted to in East Sacramento. =Southside Park= The park was created by the City about 100 years ago, at the urging of members of Southside Improvement Club, an organization of local residents that still exists and still meets monthly in the basement of St. Elizabeth's Church at 12th & S. The City bought the land in 1906, but the park took a number of years to build. The sewage canal was filled in. The lake was dredged to make it deeper and to provide fill to raise the rest of the park area to its current level. The city hired Rudolph A. Herold, George Randle, and John McClaren (who was the landscape architect for San Francisco's Golden Gate Park) to landscape the park.Dan Flynn (2002) Inside Guide to Sacramento, 3rd ed., Embarcadero Press The amphitheater was built in 1934 and was named after Robert Callahan, former Southside Improvement Club member and County Supervisor. He is buried in the Sacramento Historic City Cemetery (aka Old City Cemetery) on Broadway. The park has always been popular as both a day-to- day refuge for residents in the neighborhood and the entire city and for special events. \\"In 1939, California celebrated its centennial ... Sacramento held a three-month celebration in Southside Park called Roaring Camp. From May until August, the southern end of Southside Park became a California mining town. More than 50 structures constructed especially for Roaring Camp were built, many based loosely on actual buildings located in Sacramento or other California cities.\\" Bill Burg, (2007) Sacramento's Southside Park, Arcadia Publishing A few of the buildings were retained after Roaring Camp. One was used as a draftee induction center during World War II. For some time there were boats that could be rented for pleasure rides on the lake. For years the City held its Fourth of July celebrations in Southside Park, sending up fireworks from the island. Cesar Chavez' historic United Farm Workers march from Delano to Sacramento in 1966 came to Southside Park and Our Lady of Guadalupe Church across the street. Cinco de Mayo celebrations were an annual event at Southside Park during the 1970s and 1980s until they outgrew the park, moved elsewhere, and was redesignated \\"Festival de Familia\\". The park currently hosts the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement (LCLAA)'s annual Cesar Chavez Day march and rally, which is centered on the Amphitheater. The mural on the Amphitheater was painted by members of the Royal Chicano Air Force, a long-time Sacramento group of Chicano artists/activists. RCAF member Esteban Villa returned to sing at a neighborhood event in the Park last year. The Park originally extended all the way to X Street, but construction of the W-X Freeway in the 1960s severed both the park and the lake, reducing the size of the park by 40% and eliminating one of the lake's two islands. Construction of the freeway also caused severe disruption in the neighborhood and the park, and the area deteriorated for many years. The area around 4th & T became known as \\"Hooker Hollow\\" and the park became a haven for drug use and crime. Since the 1970s neighbors have been working to clean up the park and surrounding area and in recent years the city has invested in improvements such as the clubhouse, the playground, and the improved lake-shore landscaping and fence. Criminal activity is greatly reduced and the park is popular with families. The lake is precious habitat for wildlife including fish, birds, turtles, crayfish, and more. There are just over 300 trees in the Park, representing over forty species.

Established in 1974, it was formerly known as the Tata Energy Research Institute. As the scope of its activities widened, it was renamed The Energy and Resources Institute in 2003. History Bombay House the head office of Tata Group from where TERI started operations The origins of TERI lie in Mithapur, a remote town in Gujarat, where a TATA engineer, Darbari Seth, was concerned about the enormous quantities of energy his factory spent on desalination. He proposed the idea of a research institute to tackle the depletion of natural resources and energy scarcity. J. R. D. Tata, chairman of the TATA Group, liked the idea and accepted the proposal. TERI was set up with a modest corpus of 35 million rupees. On the invitation of the then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, TERI was registered in Delhi in 1974 as the Tata Energy Research Institute. Locations TERI initially began its operations in the Bombay House, Mumbai, headquarters of Tata.

A. Henty is an adventure novel set during the British military expedition under Lord Kitchener and the subsequent destruction of the Mahdi's followers during the Mahdist War (1881‚Äì1899). It was first published in 1902. Plot Gregory Hilliard Hartley is a young man, brother to the heir of an English estate. When he marries a young lady lower on the social ladder than his father wished, he is expelled from his father's house. He soon travels to Egypt, due to his knowledge of Arabic, and obtains employment with a merchant firm. When the Dervishes attack and destroy his employer's warehouse, he joins the army under Hicks Pasha as an interpreter. The expedition is destroyed, and no news is heard of Gregory. His wife lives in Cairo, uncertain of his fate. Years pass, and she brings up their young son, also named Gregory, and ensures that he is taught several native languages. When she dies, Gregory is left alone in the world, with a small bank account and a mysterious tin box only to be opened when he is certain of his father's death. Gregory obtains a position as interpreter in the expedition under Lord Kitchener which is advancing into the Soudan to attack the Dervish forces. He endures many hardships and dangers in the great campaign, and gains high distinction, while continuing his search for his father. Soon, a discovery leads him to a clue, and the tin box, once opened, reveals a surprising discovery about his true identity. Characters * Mr. Hartley: father of the main character * Mrs. Hartley: mother of the main character * Gregory Hilliard Hartley: main character * Zaki: servant and friend * Mahmud: commander of the Dervish forces * Lord Kitchener: commander of the British forces Major themes This is an example of a Victorian subgenre of adventure fiction that celebrated the British Empire and Imperial ideals. They were mostly aimed at schoolboys and were important in maintaining enthusiasm for the Empire. A common theme, shared by this book, is the threat to the Empire from a less civilised foe; in this case the self-proclaimed Mahdi, the prophesied redeemer of the Islamic world, and his followers, who had already inflicted severe defeats on British forces. The hero, Gregory Hartley, is raised by his mother in a manner appropriate for creating an English Gentleman according to the standards of the time. In text, this is because \\"we may go back to England some day, and I should not at all like you to be less strong than others.\\" This is mainly training for physical strength, by playing games and receiving fencing lessons, but also includes ensuring that his \\"manners were those of an Englishman\\", such as chivalry, wit, compassion and charity. He is described as having \\"much of the bearing and appearance of an English public school boy\\" but only \\"much\\" and not all of the bearing. Henty initially leaves open the possibility of Gregory becoming whole. Gregory lacks a proper public school education and so cannot normally be considered a genuine English gentleman. However, the fact that he is out in the Empire rather than the United Kingdom grants Gregory an exception to this rule. As was common at the time of writing, Henty stereotypes the races in the story along martial lines, with the English as a physical and moral benchmark. The Egyptian peasants are written as sturdy but agricultural and not warlike. The black Sudanese, however, are \\"splendid fellows ‚Äì they love fighting for fighting's sake. It is in their opinion the only worthy occupation for a man, and they have shown themselves worthy to fight for the side of our men.\\" Henty qualifies this praise, however, by infantilising the Sudanese and making clear that they require English leadership and discipline to be most effective. The Sudanese and the Mahdist Dervishes are the most courageous and therefore have higher status, in the story, than the Egyptians, who are not far behind when led by the English. The English themselves are seen as too advanced to be included on this scale. English moral superiority is established throughout the novel, such as when Gregory saves a woman from drowning and is captured as a result. The woman is revealed to be the wife of Gregory's captor, Mahmud, the Khalifa's son. Both Mahmud and, earlier, Gregory's Arab servant Zaki express surprise that Gregory would risk his life to save her. To Mahmud, Gregory explains English chivalry: \\"What I did, Emir, I believe any white officer who was a good swimmer would have done. No Englishman would see a woman drowning without making an effort to save her, if he had it in his power. As to the fact that she was not of the same race or religion, he would never give it a thought. It would be quite enough for him that she was a woman.\\" Development history The book was written in London and was based heavily on contemporary reports filed by newspaper correspondents. Literary significance and reception This book was a sequel to Henty's own A Dash for Khartoum in terms of setting. Henty rarely included women in his works and, when he did, they were usually present only in relation to the main character. Annie Hartley in this novel is one of Henty's examples of a strong-willed woman, who raises her only son after her husband dies in battle.

Founded in 1924, it represented the trend of French social Catholicism, while remaining a party embodying the ideology of centrism. The party's ideology was inspired by the popularism of Luigi Sturzo's Italian People's Party. The PDP was a co-founder in 1925 of the International Secretariat of Democratic Parties of Christian Inspiration (SIPDIC). The PDP had its roots in French Catholicism and various Christian movements inspired by Hugues Felicit√© Robert de Lamennais and later continued by Marc Sangnier's Le Sillon, the Young Republic League and the Popular Liberal Action (ALP), the party of republican Catholics founded in 1902 and dissolved in 1919. HistoryFoundation= The creation of the PDP has its premises in the context of the immediate post-war, the reintegration of Catholics in the nation by the wartime Union sacr√©e and the involvement of Catholics in power during the National Bloc (1919‚Äì1924). From the National Bloc, fourteen deputies founded the core of the PDP prior to the 1924 legislative election. Established by Congress on 15 and 16 November 1924, under the chairmanship of George Thibout and involving 200 delegates, the PDP supported the desire to achieve \\"a task in bringing reconciliation around the idea of Republicanism\\" by the definition of \\"new Republican faith\\" The Popular Democrats advocated that religion was not and should not be a line between right and left. However, the PDP oriented itself to the centre-right in direct competition to the Republican Federation, the party from which most of the PDP's members came from and where social Catholics concentrated since the demise of the ALP. =1932 - 1940= Faced to the governing left-wing Cartel des Gauches, the PDP ranked itself in the parliamentary opposition but stayed outside of the National Catholic Federation (FNC), founded by General √âdouard de Castelnau as a reaction to the perceived anti-clerical legislation passed by √âdouard Herriot's cabinet. The PDP supported the ministries of Raymond Poincar√©, seduced by his stabilizing of the economic situation, but hostile to the lack of social legislation. In addition, the PDP developed the popular theme of \\"party of the centre\\" or \\"Cartel of the Centres\\", which explained their support for the Ministry led Andr√© Tardieu (November 1929-February 1930). Despite its position, the PDP had little weight in the different governments formed between 1926 and 1932. Only Auguste Champetier de Ribes participated in various governments between 1928 and 1930. However, the PDP acquired increasing visibility both on the ground locally and by increasing its number of elected officials at all levels (local, departmental and national). Faced with the growing threat from the Popular Democrats, the Republican Federation virulently opposed the PDP via the popular voice of Henry K√©rillis who alleged that the PDP divided the \\"national right\\". Only Georges Pernot advocated collaboration between his party (the Federation) and the PDP. The PDP was moved to the right by the Stavisky Affair and during the 6 February 1934 crisis where the party supported the parliamentary right's arguments. In its later years, the PDP divided into broad left-wing and right- wing factions. =World War II and post-war= If the majority of the parliamentary party voted full powers to Marshal Philippe P√©tain on 10 July 1940, the PDP, however, provided the largest contingent of opponents against full powers within the right (Pierre de Chambrun, Auguste Champetier de Ribes, Paul Simon). While a number of Popular Democrats collaborated with the Vichy Regime, others, such as Georges Bidault joined the resistance. Following the war, a large majority of Popular Democrats joined the Christian democratic Popular Republican Movement, which had its roots in the resistance movement. Some members also joined the Rally of Republican Lefts. Ideology *The PDP was attached to the Republic and to political liberties. In this sense, the PDP adhered to the Christian democratic idea that one can be Republican and Catholic. However, the PDP opposed French la√Øcit√© and defended the liberty of confessional education. *The PDP opposed both economic liberalism and socialism, and aimed to achieve democracy in the economic and social organization by the gradual reform and collaboration between the various elements of production (mixed by unions and employee representatives in particular). Advocating state intervention in the economy, the PDP wanted to achieve social justice through the application of a Catholic social program (8-hour work day, paid leave, social insurance, family allowances). *On the institutional level, the PDP advocated administrative, social and economic decentralization. The party also supported a more powerful executive, while upholding the legislative power by imposing rules that allow for government stability. The PDP supported proportional representation, women's suffrage and the family vote (the head of the family would have a number of votes proportional to the size of his family (wives and children) in addition to his own in elections). *In foreign policy, the PDP supported the League of Nations. It supported the Franco-German rapprochement after World War I.

Plot In a rundown Paris dwelling, an angry Hagolin accuses mistress Eponine of seeing a man named Larnier behind his back. In a party at a stately home, meanwhile, prosperous attorney Lamerciere's guests include his longtime mistress, Florence, and his young law partner, Claude. Eponine wants to murder Hagolin and attempts to, but fails. Larnier intervenes on her behalf, but merely wanted to gag Hagolin with a scarf before Eponine strangles the man with it. The body is dismembered and dumped, then Eponine is placed under arrest. Claude, who is secretly Florence's lover, feels he deserves credit for much of Lamerciere's courtroom success. He leaps at the opportunity when Eponine asks him to defend her. Lamerciere caustically remarks that Claude and Florence could do to him exactly what the accused woman and lover Larnier did to their victim Hagolin. In court, Lamerciere manages to persuade Claude to let him make the closing argument. He paints such a lurid picture of Eponine's crime that it gets her convicted. His gaze at Florence makes it clear that he knows she has been unfaithful.

He was re-elected in 2006 and 2010. He served as an assistant minority leader from 2005 to 2006 and 2008 to 2010. Prior to being elected to the Senate, Gerlach was a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, being first elected in 1998 in the old House District 36A, and re-elected in 2000 and 2002. After the 2002 redistricting, the area was known as House District 37A. Gerlach served as assistant majority leader and Majority Whip in the Senate from January through December 2011.New Senate majority leader? In crisis, Republicans turn to Senjem again He chairs the Senate Commerce and Consumer Protection Committee, and is also a member of the Senate's Capital Investment, Environment and Natural Resources, and Rules and Administration committees. His special legislative concerns included tax relief, less government spending, education reform, and public safety. Gerlach supports \\"right-to-work\\" legislation in Minnesota. In March 2012, he used his bulk-mail business to send mail to several fellow Senators constituents to pressure them to support the measure. Democrats in the Minnesota Senate considered filing an ethics complaint against Gerlach. Senator Tom Bakk said Gerlach \\"[seemed] to be benefiting by the action of the caucus in a way the general public is not.\\" Ortman called Gerlach's decision to use his business to mail against other Senators \\"shocking\\" and \\"very troublesome and should be troubling to all Minnesotans.\\" Days after news broke that he used his bulk-mail business to mail against other Senators, Gerlach announced that he would not seek re-election to the Minnesota Senate. On May 19, 2012, Gerlach announced he would be running for the Dakota County Board of Commissioners in 2012. Gerlach's involvement in the termination of a former employee of the Minnesota Senate, Michael Brodkorb, has come under scrutiny due to a pending lawsuit by Brodkorb. Gerlach and an aide in his Senate office, Aaron Cocking, were listed in initial paperwork regarding Brodkorb's planned lawsuit over his termination from the Minnesota Senate. On May 25, 2012, the Minnesota Senate released legal bills showing they had spent $46,150 in the first 3 months of 2012 to prepare a defense to Brodkorb's suit. On June 19, 2012, the Minnesota Senate announced additional legal bills in the amount of $38,533, bringing the total legal costs incurred by the Minnesota Senate due to the termination of Brodkorb to almost $85,000 since the end of the May 2012. Community involvement Long active in his local community, he is a member of Apple Valley American Legion Post 1776, where he serves as the Post Chairmen of the boys state youth in government program. He has been a member of the Civil Air Patrol for forty years. As a teenager, he earned the General Carl A. Spaatz Award, of which only 2000 members have earned since its inception in 1964. He is still a member of the Civil Air Patrol, and three local Chamber of Commerce. He has also served on the Dakota County Human Services Advisory Committee and as a board member of the Apple Valley Optimist Club ‚Äì a service organization dedicated to fostering a wide range of youth programs. As his son has grown, Chris Gerlach has become active in the Westview Elementary Cub Scout Pack 205. His family attends Berean Baptist Church in Burnsville. Personal As the youngest of six children to Don and Marlene Gerlach, he was amongst the first to arrive in the Lebanon Township ‚Äì soon to become the City of Apple Valley. His late father had long ago retired from the civil service with the St. Paul Army Corps of Engineers and his mother has now retired after a 45-year career as a registered nurse. He attended Westview Elementary School, Valley Middle School and graduated from Apple Valley High School in 1983. Chris Gerlach was introduced to public service and the military early on as a Civil Air Patrol Cadet at age 13, ultimately earning top leadership awards and rank within the cadet program. This set him on a course to the University of St. Thomas in Saint Paul, where he received a BA in political science. Before graduation, however, he was fortunate to land an internship with U.S. Senator Rudy Boschwitz. This experience over ten months spent in St. Paul and Washington D.C. furthered his interest in public policy and public service. Chris Gerlach then joined the United States Air Force, and was a lieutenant and intercontinental ballistic missile crew commander at Ellsworth Air Force Base. He later earned his M.B.A. at the University of South Dakota in Vermillion, South Dakota. By the early 1990s, the Cold War was over and the world was changing. He was promoted to the rank of Captain and was working as a crew commander deactivating the weapon systems he had once worked to maintain on constant alert status. In 1993, he made the decision to return to civilian life and move back to Apple Valley with the desire to get back involved in politics as a way to make a difference in people's lives. He and his wife, Shelli, live in Apple Valley, and have two children.http://www.votesmart.org/bio.php?can_id=20283 He owns and operates a direct marketing and bulk mail processing business in Eagan.

He helped make federal funds available for construction, in order to promote the use of fieldstone, following the Hudson Valley's Dutch Colonial architectural heritage. In 1993 the school building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was closed and no longer used as an elementary school as of June 2012. The historic building now houses part of the district Universal Pre-K program, Pupil Services Offices, and the Technical Services Department. History Roosevelt had a longtime interest in the region's stone Dutch buildings, owing to his own heritage. In 1927 he had made sure that the new Hyde Park library, which his family had donated money for, was built of fieldstone. Later, as president, he chose a demolished colonial house as the model for Hyde Park's new post office, after successfully pushing for similar post offices in neighboring Poughkeepsie and Rhinebeck. In 1938 he met privately with members of the Hyde Park school board and other local officials at his family home in town. He had closely followed their need for an elementary school, and proposed to them that the Public Works Administration (PWA) make federal money available to Hyde Park for the construction of three schools (now Violet Avenue Elementary School and the first Franklin D. Roosevelt High School, now Haviland Middle School) that would centralize the smaller local districts into one large one. The PWA eventually picked up 45% of the construction costs. The president insisted on the use of fieldstone for the elementary school despite heavy lobbying for brick from the local bricklayer's union, believing that institutional architecture in the Hudson Valley should reflect a continuity with its traditional styles and construction methods. He personally approved architect Ross Sluyter's design before construction began, and spoke at the dedication ceremony for all three schools when they opened in 1940. At that time the school consisted of its current central block, a single-story seven- bay rectangle in a randomly coursed ashlar pattern with a slate-shingled gable roof pierced by two brick chimneys. It stood in the middle of a lot. Smaller wings project from all sides save the west, still the building's main entrance. It opens to a classic Colonial Revival center-hall plan, with much of the original finishes remaining. In 1957, it was necessary to expand the building as the baby boom generation began to hit school age. A flat-roofed brick classroom wing was built on the southwest corner, with a two-story gym wing extending from its north. The auditorium/gymnasium was converted into the cafeteria, ending a need for students living nearby to eat at home due to crowding. The original cafeteria is now the school's main special education classroom. In 1963 these additions were completed. Another wing was added in 1990 for county BOCES (Board of Cooperative Educational Services) use Closing Due to declining student enrollment in the district, it was closed at the end of the 2011-2012 school year. Former students now attend North Park Elementary or Ralph R. Smith Elementary Schools. The school is used for administrative offices, a district operated pre-kindergarten class, and is rented to community groups.

He reigned during a period of great upheaval in the Sasanian Empire. He became patriarch at the end of a disastrous war between Rome and Persia, which weakened both powers. Two years later the Moslem Arabs began a career of conquest in which they overthrew the Sassanian empire and occupied the eastern provinces of the Roman empire. Isho øyahb lived through this momentous period, and is said to have met both the Roman emperor Heraclius and the second Moslem caliph  øUmar ibn al-Khattab. The Syriac name Isho øyahb means 'Jesus has given', and is spelled variously in English. Alternative spellings include Yeshuyab and Ishu-yahb. Isho øyahb II is commonly known as Isho øyahb of Gdala, to distinguish him from two near-contemporary Nestorian patriarchs, Isho øyahb I of Arzun (582‚Äì95) and Isho øyahb III of Adiabene (649‚Äì59).  Sources  Isho øyahb's patriarchate, the Arab conquest of Iraq and Isho øyahb's dealings with the Moslem leaders are described in considerable detail in the Chronicle of Seert.Chronicle of Seert (ed. Scher), ii. 234‚Äì305 Briefer accounts are given in the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (thirteenth-century), and the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth-century),  øAmr (fourteenth-century) and Sliba (fourteenth-century). Life Isho øyahb was a native of the village of Gdala in the district of Beth  øArbaye between Nisibis and Mosul.Chronicle of Seert (ed. Scher), ii. 234 Isho øyahb studied at the School of Nisibis when it was under the presidency of the controversial theologian Hnana, who searched for common theological ground between the Nestorianism of the Church of the East and the Chalcedonian doctrines held in the Roman empire. He was one of the 300 students who left the college when Hnana was expelled. After a long vacancy in the patriarchate, he was elected patriarch of the Church of the East in 628. In 630 Isho øyahb led a delegation of Persian clerics to Aleppo to discuss with the Roman emperor Heraclius the possibility of a reconciliation between the Roman and Persian Churches. Although little is known of the content of Isho øyahb‚Äôs discussions with Heraclius, he evidently persuaded the emperor that, despite its traditional reverence for the teachings of Theodore of Mopsuestia, the doctrinal position of the Church of the East was orthodox. He was asked for his views on monoenergism, the doctrine of the single energy recently espoused by the patriarchate of Constantinople, and responded with a confession of faith which was accepted by the Roman bishops. Two masses were then celebrated, one conducted by Isho øyahb according to the rite used by the Church of the East, in which both Heraclius and his bishops received the eucharist from his hands, and one according to the Chalcedonian rite. In his mass Isho øyahb omitted the customary references to the 'three doctors' Diodorus, Theodore and Nestorius, hoping that the Romans would avoid any mention of Cyril of Alexandria in theirs; but his conciliatory gesture was not reciprocated by the Romans. On his return to Persia Isho øyahb was accused by the bishop Bar Sawma of Susa of making damaging concessions to the Romans.Wilmshurst, The Martyred Church, 69 Isho øyahb II was patriarch during the Arab conquest of Iraq, and according to later Nestorian tradition approached the Moslem leaders to win guarantees for the treatment of Christians in the Sassanian empire. The Chronicle of Seert, probably written in the ninth century, records two approaches to the Moslems, one by Isho øyahb's emissaries to Muhammad's successor Abu Bakr (632‚Äì4), and a second by Isho øyahb himself to the caliph  øUmar ibn al-Khattab (634‚Äì44).  øUmar is said to have granted the Church of the East a charter of protection.Chronicle of Seert (ed. Scher), ii. 298‚Äì304 The authenticity of these supposed approaches is very doubtful, and modern authorities are inclined to reject them.Robinson, Empire and Elites, 1‚Äì32; Wilmshurst, The Martyred Church, 102‚Äì3 Seleucia-Ctesiphon, the capital of the Sasanian empire and the seat of the Nestorian patriarchs at this period, fell to Sa ød b. Abi Waqqas in the spring of 637. Sa ød carried off its gates, symbolising the rulership of central Iraq, to Kufa, and for the rest of his reign Isho øyahb resided at Karka d'Beth Slokh (modern Kirkuk) in Beth Garmai. In 645 Isho øyahb journeyed to Nisibis to settle a dispute between the city's Nestorian Christians and their metropolitan Quriaqos. He died at Karkh Guddan and was buried there.Chronicle of Seert (ed. Scher), ii. 304‚Äì5 = Literary achievement = Isho øyahb II is included in the list of Syriac authors compiled by the fourteenth-century Nestorian writer  øAbdisho ø of Nisibis. According to  øAbdisho ø, his principal writings were a commentary on the Psalms and a number of letters, histories, and homilies. A hymn of his has survived in a Nestorian psalter (MS BM Add. 14675). = Nestorian mission to China, 635 = The first recorded Christian mission to China arrived in the Chinese capital Chang'an in 635, during Isho øyahb's reign. The mission, whose history was recorded on the famous Nestorian Stele, erected in Chang'an in 781, was led by a Nestorian monk with the Chinese name A-lo-pen. It is possible, but by no means certain, that Isho øyahb was behind this initiative. See also * List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East NotesReferences * Abbeloos, J. B., and Lamy, T.

History Roamer Competence La Grande Chronograph, Equipped with the unique Dubois D√©praz 2025 chronograph module Roamer was founded in Solothurn, Switzerland, in 1888 by Fritz Meyer. At first, Meyer and employees concentrated on manufacturing cylinder escapements,. Within only 7 years (in 1895), the company grows to 60 employees and produces complete watches. In the same year the company develops its first own calibre and names it number 38 to commemorate the 38th birthday of the company‚Äôs founder. In 1905 Meyer joined with fellow watchmaker Johann Studeli to form the partnership Meyer and Studeli (MST). In the same year Meyer won a Bronze medal at the Liege World Fair. The partnership continued to develop new calibres and enter them into more World Fairs, winning Silver Medals at the Milan Fair in 1906 and Brussels Fair in 1910. The earliest identified watch is an unmarked lady's pocket watch containing an MST 41 cylinder escapement that has London silver hallmarks for 1908. In 1917 they purchased fellow Solothurn watchmaker L Tieche Gammeter (LTG). LTG had previously registered the brand \\"Roamer\\" in 1908. In 1918 the partnership incorporated into the company Meyer & Studeli SA. By 1923, production grew to one million units. The jeweled lever-escapement watches were sold under the brand 'Roamer'. Cylinder, and later pin-lever, watches were sold under the brands Medana and Meda. In 1932 the company started its own dial production line. In 1945, a representative office opened in New York City and in 1952 Meyer and Studeli officially changed its name to Roamer Watch Co. SA. In 1955, Roamer patented the Anfibio watertight watchcase, which proved to be a commercial success. The company launched its first quartz movement in 1972. In 2003, Roamer returned to manufacturing mechanical watches. In 2013, its 125 year anniversary, Roamer launched a limited new edition of the Stingray Chrono Diver watch.

For his dissertation, he explored how an indigenous peasant community responded to globalization. Since that time much of his work has focused on migration, economic development and identity. He received his doctorate in 1994 and is currently a professor at Ohio State University in the department of anthropology and a member of steering committee for the Initiative in Population Research.  Research  Since the late 1980s, Cohen has worked in Oaxaca's central valleys region, specifically in the community of Santa Ana del Valle. This research is documented in his book, Cooperation and Community, published in 1999 by the University of Texas Press. In 2004 he published the Culture of Migration, also with the University of Texas Press. This book documents a long-term study of migration in 13 villages, all located in Oaxaca's central valleys. The book argues that a \\"culture of migration\\" defines movement and frames migration as one of the many strategic moves Oaxacans participate in to organize their lives. Cohen notes the importance of domestic migration, the rise of international and transnational movers and the role that remittances play in the lives of Oaxaquenos in their home communities. He has also worked on Dominican migration to the United States where he was part of an interdisciplinary investigation of why Dominicans are traveling to Reading, Pennsylvania. He conducts collaborative and comparative research with Ibrahim Sirkeci on Kurdish and Mexican immigration issues. In 2007 he began an analysis of the impact of political and civil unrest in Oaxaca on migration patterns and compared Oaxacan and Chiapaneco migration patterns.

A British squadron, comprising one light cruiser and four destroyers on a routine patrol, encountered the German 7th Half Flotilla of torpedo boats which was en route to the British coast to lay mines. The British forces attacked and the outgunned German force attempted to flee and then fought a desperate and ineffective action against the British force, which sank all four German boats. The battle resulted in the loss of the German torpedo boat squadron and prevented the mining of busy shipping lanes, such as the mouth of the River Thames. The British had few casualties and little damage to their vessels. The battle influenced the tactics and deployments of the remaining German torpedo boat flotillas in the North Sea area, as the loss shook the faith of their commanders in the effectiveness of the force. Background After the opening naval Battle of Heligoland Bight, the German High Seas Fleet was ordered to avoid confrontations with larger opposing forces, to avoid costly and demoralising reverses. Apart from occasional German raids and forays by German light forces, the North Sea was dominated by the Royal Navy which regularly patrolled the area. On 16 October 1914, information about activity by German light forces in the Heligoland Bight became more definite and the 1st Division of the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla (Harwich Force), consisting of the new light cruiser (Captain Cecil Fox) and four destroyers, , , and was sent to investigate. At 13:50 on 17 October, while steaming northwards, about to the south-west of the island of Texel, the 1st Division encountered a squadron of German torpedo boats, comprising the remaining vessels of the 7th Half Flotilla (Korvettenkapit√§n Georg Thiele in ) , , about ahead. The German ships were sailing abreast, about apart, on a bearing slightly to the east of the 1st Division. The German ships made no hostile move against the British and made no attempt flee; the British assuming that they had mistaken the ships for friendly vessels. The German flotilla was part of the Emden Patrol and had been sent out of the Ems River, to mine the southern coast of Britain including the mouth of the Thames but had been intercepted before reaching its objective. alt=A German Torpedo boat cruising at sea with smoke billowing from a stack amidships. The British squadron out-gunned the German 7th Half Flotilla. HMS Undaunted‚Äîan Arethusa- class light cruiser‚Äîwas armed with two BL 6 inch Mk XII naval guns and seven QF 4 inch Mk V naval guns, in single mounts (most without gun shields) and eight torpedo tubes. Undaunted was experimentally armed with a pair of 2-pounder anti-aircraft guns, something most of her class lacked and at best speed could make . The four Laforey-class destroyers were armed with four torpedo tubes in two twin mounts, three 4-inch guns and a 2-pounder gun. The destroyers were slightly faster than the cruiser and could make about at full power. The German vessels were inferior to the British in other areas, the 7th Half Flotilla was composed of ageing 1898 class boats and had been completed in 1904. The German boats were nearly equal in speed to the British at . Each of the German vessels was armed with three guns, that were of shorter range and throw-weight than the British guns. The biggest danger to the British squadron was the five torpedoes carried by each German boat. Battle Island of Texel Upon closer approach, the German vessels realised the nearby vessels were British and scattered, while Undaunted‚Äîwhich was closer to the Germans than the destroyers‚Äîopened fire on the nearest torpedo boat. This German vessel managed to dodge the fire from Undaunted by changing course but lost speed and the British force caught up. To protect Undaunted from torpedo attack and to destroy the Germans as quickly as possible, Fox ordered the squadron to divide. Lance and Lennox chased S115 and S119 as Legion and Loyal pursued S117 and S118. Fire from Legion, Loyal and Undaunted damaged S118 so badly that its bridge was blown off the deck, sinking her at 15:17. Lance and Lennox engaged S115, disabling her steering gear and causing the German vessel to circle. Lennoxs fire was so effective that the bridge of S115 was also destroyed but the German torpedo-boat did not strike her colours. alt=Four German torpedo boats under fire from British ships off of the Dutch island of Texel. The two central boats in the German flotilla, S117 and the flotilla leader S119, tried to hit Undaunted with torpedoes but Undaunted outmanoeuvred the German boats and remained unscathed. When Legion and Loyal had finished off S118, they came to Undaunteds aid and engaged the two attackers. Legion attacked S117, which fired its last three torpedoes and continued to engage with gunfire. Legion pulverised S117, damaging her steering mechanism which forced her to circle before she was sunk at 15:30. At the same time, Lance and Lennox had damaged S115 to the point where only one of the destroyers was needed. Lance joined Loyal in bombarding S119 with lyddite shells. S119 managed to fire a torpedo at Lance and hit the destroyer amidships but the torpedo failed to detonate. S119 was sunk at 15:35 by gunfire from Lance and Loyal, taking the German flotilla commander down with it. S115 stayed afloat despite constant attacks from Lennox, which sent a boarding party, who found a wreck with only one German on board who happily surrendered. Thirty members of the crew were eventually rescued from the sea by the British vessels. The action ended at 16:30, with gunfire from Undaunted finishing off the abandoned hulk of S115. AftermathAnalysis= alt=The German Seventh Half Flotilla cruising at sea consisting of five torpedo boats one of which did not take part in the Battle off Texel The battle was seen as a great boost of morale for the British as two days previous, they had lost the cruiser to a U-boat. The effect on British morale is reflected in its inclusion in the 1915 novel The Boy Allies Under Two Flags, written by Robert L. Drake. The hospital ship , which had been sent out to rescue survivors from the sunken boats, was seized by the British for violating the Hague Convention rules on the use of hospital ships. The loss of a squadron of German torpedo boats led to a drastic change in tactics in the English Channel and along the coast of Flanders. There were fewer sorties into the Channel and the torpedo boat force was relegated to coastal patrol and rescuing aircrew. The British received a bonus on 30 November, when a trawler pulled up the sealed chest thrown off S119 by Captain Thiele. The chest contained a codebook used by the German light forces stationed on the coast, allowing the British to read German wireless communication for long afterwards. =Casualties= Despite the odds, no German vessel struck her colours and the flotilla fought to the end. The four ships of the German Seventh Half Flotilla were sunk by Harwich Force and over two hundred sailors were killed, including the commanding officer. Thirty-one German sailors were rescued and taken prisoner; a captured officer died of wounds soon after. Two more German sailors were later rescued by a neutral vessel. Only four British sailors were wounded and three of their destroyers were lightly damaged. Legion had one shell hit and one man was wounded by machine-gun fire. Loyal was hit twice and had three or four men wounded. Lance had superficial machine-gun damage and the other vessels were unscathed.

The business was incorporated in 1957 as Bedding Discount Center; in 1975 the chain was renamed to Sleepy's. In 1977, Sleepy's opened its eighth store and relocated its corporate offices and warehouse to a space in New Hyde Park. In 1986, it relocated its headquarters and distribution center to a building in Port Washington, NY. In 1993 Sleepy's acquired Kleinsleep and in 1996 Mattress Discounters in New York and New Jersey. In 1994, the 75th store opened and the corporate headquarters and distribution center moved to Bethpage, NY in a building that was expanded in 1995 to . David Acker, Harry's son, became the president of Sleepy's in 2001. In 2002, Sleepy's built a new warehouse in Robbinsville, New Jersey. Mattress Firm sleep chains locations in Connecticut and Massachusetts were acquired in 2003, and in 2007 Sleepy's acquired the Rockaway Bedding chain adding 200 stores. In the summer of 2009 Sleepy's moved its headquarters and New York distribution facility to a newly constructed 500,000-square-foot (46,000 m2) building in Hicksville, New York.

Business operations A Sleepy's store in Brooklyn, New York, opened in 1975 Sleepy's carried mattress brands including Sealy, Serta, Simmons, Beautyrest, Posturepedic, Tempur-Pedic, King Koil, and Stearns & Foster. Like other major retailers, Sleepy's carried mattress lines that were unique to the seller, so there was no way to compare prices with their competitors. Sleepy's stores were located primarily in the Northeastern, Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest, including Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Indiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Virginia, Vermont, and West Virginia.

The complexity and globally outsourced nature of today‚Äôs supply chains combined with the practice of optimization techniques such as lean and just-in-time manufacturing in order to improve efficiency has increased supply chain vulnerabilities to even minor supply disruptions. While these models have allowed companies to reduce overall costs and expand quickly into new markets, they also expose the company to the risk of a supplier suddenly going bankrupt, closing operations, data breach or being acquired. Among the several types of supply disruptions, most severe are those that have a relatively low probability of occurrence with a very high severity of impact when they do occur. While such risks cannot be eliminated, however, its severity can be reduced. Objectives To overcome these challenges, companies mitigate supply chain interruptions and reduce risk with strategies and tactics that address supplier-centric risk at multiple stages in the relationship: * On boarding: Bringing suppliers into the operation with registration that includes: ** A centralized supplier registration portal ** Integration of third party performance, financial data and predictive indicators into the supplier profile * Monitoring for stability beyond financial data, including: ** Criminal and terrorists (i.e. Office of Foreign Assets Control) ties and operational performance ** Visibility into potential disruptions caused by geopolitical threats, acts of nature, etc. * Cultivating strategic supplier relationships for the long-term: ** Leverage supplier scorecards for continuous improvement ** Establish and use benchmarks for measuring supplier performance ** Creating a system for collaboration and supplier development * Establish control across the extended enterprise: ** Create integrated supplier networks ** Extend performance management benchmarks to second and third tier suppliers  Supplier risk in recession and recovery  In 2008-2009, manufacturers experienced the startling speed at which suppliers can move from stability to shutting down operations. The devastating impact of a crucial supplier failure has moved risk management from add-on service to mission-critical. With a new focus on risk management, manufacturers have seen value whether the economy is stagnant or thriving. With a transparent, accessible and comprehensive set of supplier information, manufacturers have been able to monitor suppliers for behavioral changes which contribute to overall stability, including: * Changes in the supplier‚Äôs management team * EPA violations * OSHA incidents * Quality issues * Noticeable lags in response time to inquiries * OFAC violations Changes in any of these conditions can be defined as parameters for raising an alert. For example, a financially stable supplier may in fact be about to lose it CEO to retirement ‚Äì which may cause issues within the management team. Early visibility into that change gives the manufacturer time to ensure it doesn‚Äôt negatively affect customers. Based on the criticality of the supplier and the nature of the alert received, the manufacturer can then choose to take necessary action, such as calling or visiting the supplier, increasing monitoring, or moving towards terminating the relationship with the supplier and finding a replacement.  Benefits  Reducing supplier risk can: * Give insight to manufacturers to create defensive and offensive strategies that turn risk into a competitive advantage. * Help determine whether or not it is beneficial for a company to conduct a customer intervention and know in advance what the potential outcomes might be for an intervention. * Improve competitive position in the market. * Lower supplier costs. * Position manufacturers to better address customer needs by addressing supplier vulnerabilities before they become apparent. * Prevent loss of customer's trust due to data exposure or systems being hacked.

The project was originated by Mathieu Desnoyers with an initial release in 2005. Its predecessor is the Linux Trace Toolkit. LTTng uses the Tracepoint instrumentation of the Linux kernel, as well as various other information sources such as kprobes, and the Perf performance monitoring counters. Designed for minimal performance impact and having a near-zero impact when not tracing, it is useful for debugging a wide range of bugs that are otherwise extremely challenging. Features The challenging problems traceable with LTTng include, for example, performance problems on parallel systems and on real-time systems. Custom instrumentation is easy to add. Structure LTTng consists of kernel modules (for Linux kernel tracing) and dynamically linked libraries (for application and library tracing). It is controlled by a session daemon, which receives commands from a command line interface, lttng. The Babeltrace project allows translating traces into a human-readable log, and provides a trace reading library, libbabeltrace. Deployment LTTng is available as a set of packages.lttng download LTTng has at least basic support for all Linux-supported architectures (see the LTTng-modules README file for more details) as well as support for FreeBSD. Major users include Google, IBM, Autodesk, Siemens, Nokia, Sony and Ericsson. It is included in Wind River Workbench, Mentor Graphics Mentor Embedded Linux, ELinOS embedded Linux, MontaVista Mobilinux 5.0, STLinux and SUSE Linux Enterprise Real-Time Linux distributions. Once collected, multiple solutions exist to process and visualize LTTng trace data (kernel and userspace) such as the open-source LTTV viewer, Eclipse Trace CompassTrace Compass or commercial tools such as Mentor Graphics' Sourcery Analyzer and Percepio Tracealyzer.Percepio Tracealyzer LTTng-modules, LTTng-UST, LTTng-tools and Babeltrace are actively developed by an open community.

To date, the foundation has raised tens of thousands of dollars for brain cancer research. Origin The plan to establish the foundation came about in January 2008, after three friends who had recently graduated from the University of Southern California decided to create the foundation as a means of helping combat GBM. The cofounders of the foundation are George Kohan, Isaac Meier, and Samuel Zidovetzki. At the time, Isaac's father had recently been diagnosed with GBM, which served as the impetus for the establishment of the foundation. Fundraising events The foundation has hosted multiple fundraising events throughout the United States, including notable events in New York and California. One of the foundation's first major fundraising events, \\"Bowling for Brains\\", was hosted in April 2009 at the Lucky Strike Lanes in Manhattan, New York. This event served as the first substantial opportunity for the foundation to make its existence and goals known to the general public. The success of this event ensured its recurrence on an annual basis for years to come. Another notable fundraising event took place on September 3, 2009 at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles, California, where 'Russian Romantics with the Los Angeles Philharmonic' was the performance for the evening. Smaller, more frequent, events include biweekly visits to the University of Southern California's University Park campus. At these events, representatives of the foundation hand out brochures, flyers, and other materials which highlight the foundation's activities and future goals, and recruit students and professors to help achieve these goals. Associations The foundation works closely with several physicians and physician scientists, including Dr. Thomas C. Chen from the University of Southern California. Dr. Chen specializes in neuro-oncology, treating a wide range of brain and spinal cord tumors. His laboratory emphasizes translating new research findings into clinical trials, with efforts at developing novel therapies aimed at targeting tumor cells specifically for destruction, with minimal damage to normal cells.

By 1970 the DGI had managed to train hundreds of Sandinista guerrilla leaders and had a strong influence over the organization. In 1969 the DGI had financed and organized an operation to free the jailed Sandinista leader Carlos Fonseca from his prison in Costa Rica. Fonseca was re-captured shortly after the jail break, but after a plane carrying executives from the United Fruit Company was hijacked by the FSLN, he was again freed and allowed to travel to Cuba. DGI chief Manuel \\"Redbeard\\" Pi√±eiro commented that \\"of all the countries in Latin America, the most active work being carried out by us is in Nicaragua.\\" After the successful ouster of the right-wing Somoza dictatorship, DGI involvement in the new Sandinista government expanded rapidly. An early indication of the central role that the DGI would play in the Cuban-Nicaraguan relationship was a meeting in Havana on July 27, 1979, at which diplomatic ties between the two countries were re- established after more than 25 years. Juli√°n L√≥pez D√≠az, a prominent DGI agent, was named Cuban Ambassador to Nicaragua. Cuban military and DGI advisors, initially brought in during the Sandinista insurgency, would swell to over 2,500 and operated with all levels of the new Nicaraguan government. While the Cubans would like to have helped more in the development of Nicaragua towards socialism, it was difficult to counter the United States' power and influence in the rest of Central America and the assistance they gave to the Contras. Following the more overt US invasion of Grenada, countries previously looking for support from Cuba saw that the United States government was likely to take violent action to punish this. Post- revolution The early years of the Nicaraguan Revolution were strongly influenced by Cuba. The Sandinista leaders acknowledged that the FSLN owed a great debt to the communist island. The relationship was made possible because of Cuba's commitment to the strategy of revolutionary guerrilla warfare. Once the Sandinistas assumed power, Cuba gave Nicaragua military advice, as well as aid in education, health care, vocational training and industry building for the impoverished Nicaraguan economy. In return, Nicaragua provided Cuba with grains and other foodstuffs. Once the Sandinistas assumed power, Cuba began sending aid, and it became an essential component of Nicaraguan development strategy. Cuban aid was more beneficial than most countries' because it came in the form of grants and unconditional loans. (Roberto Perez, 1987) During the Somoza period, Nicaragua had been nearly 90% dependent on the US for assistance. In 1980, Cuban-Nicaraguan aid relations became formalized with the formation of the Mixed Commission for Scientific, Economic and Technical Cooperation. This commission is represented on the Cuban side by the State of Committee for Economic Cooperation and on the Nicaraguan side by the Ministry of Economic Cooperation. New aid agreements were negotiated every year within the framework of the commission. In this context the commission provides a vehicle for Nicaragua to present its various needs and for Cuba to evaluate which ones they can fulfill.Prevost, p 126 From 1979 to 1987, the commission oversaw approximately 300 million dollars (US) in aid to Nicaragua, which according to Prevost does not include military aid or the cost of schooling Nicaraguans in Cuba.

The species lives mainly in the intertidal zone, and is native to the Northeast Pacific from Southern California to Mexico, but has since been introduced to many other countries. Adults are herbivorous and consume algae but juveniles are carnivorous and consume moulting females. They reproduce in sponges but do not feed near them. Reproduction Their reproductive strategy is of interest, as both males and females are unusual among animals. Males are polymorphic and exist in 3 forms, Œ±, Œ≤, and Œ≥ of different sizes. Of the three, Œ± males are the largest and most dominant; they mate with multiple females in a harem. The Œ≤ males mimic the females and therefore manage to mate with some of the females in an Œ± male's harem. The Œ≥ form is much smaller and mimics the juvenile form, also allowing it to escape detection. Relatively speaking, the Œ≥ males invest the most energy in their testes, followed by the Œ≤ males and the Œ± males. Other species in which alternative reproductive strategies caused by a genetic polymorphism occur are the swordtail (Xiphophorus nigrensis), the tree lizard (Urosaurus ornatus), the ruff (Philomachus pugnax) and the side-blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana). The Œ± males guard a spongocoel into which females (as many as 19) enter to mate. Females brood their offspring internally within a brood pouch and use their bodies to provide nutrition to their developing young before they are released. Females only reproduce once, with larger females producing more eggs. Shortly before females become fertile, they can be cannibalistic. They then undergo a sexual moult, losing their mouthparts in the process. The eggs are fertilised inside the female, though how the sperm enter the female is unclear since the sperm of this, and other related species, are apparently immotile. The length of gestation depends on the temperature of the water ‚Äì the cooler the water, the longer it takes. The female provides nutrition directly, her internal organs and muscles degrading throughout the gestation. This gives the juveniles a headstart, before they begin feeding on intertidal algae. The females die shortly after juveniles are released. Introductions Paracerceis sculpta is thought to have been spread around the world by ships involved in international trade. The sponges they reproduce in grow on the hulls of ships and this allows Paracerceis sculpta to be transported easily. There is also a high potential for them to be spread through ballast water. Through these mechanisms Paracerceis sculpta has spread to Australia, Brazil, the Atlantic coast of Europe, Hawaii, Hong Kong, the Mediterranean and Japan. The wide range of water temperatures in its native range is thought to contribute to its ability to be spread by shipping.

Prehistory: Socialist Republicanism  The USR was founded on 3 November 1935 as a fusion of three small parties situated between the Marxist-socialist SFIO and the Radical PRRRS. It represented the consolidation into one single party of a particular political current that had been present in France since the 1890s: Socialist Republicanism. In late nineteenth-century France, formal political parties structured were virtually non-existent, except as informal parliamentary caucuses. Instead, each locality had its own socialist and/or republican club or committee, loosely grouped into federations. From 1900 these loose associations began to build a more formal structure, starting with the progressive centre-left Radical- Socialist Party (PRRRS, founded 1901) and the unified socialist party (SFIO), founded 1905). This forced left-wing republicans to decide whether to enter one or the other party. Many declined, rejecting the parliamentary-party discipline required: those right-wing Radicals who refused now labelled themselves the 'Independent Radicals' and sat in parliament in the very loose Radical Left group; from 1907, those right-wing socialists and left-wing Radicals who rejected strict party discipline called themselves 'Independent Socialists' and sat in parliament under the banner of 'Socialist Republicans', between the SFIO and PRRRS. The Socialist Republicans were highly diverse in their particular opinions, precisely as they did not possess a structured mass party but instead were a collection of independents and small local parties. However, they shared a belief in social reformism that connected them to the right wing of the SFIO, and a belief in the absolute legitimacy of parliamentary sovereignty, which connected them to the Radical-Socialists. As such, they often acted as a bridge between these two larger left-wing parties. Several of France's leading socialist and republican figures of the early 20th century originally belonged to this current: Jean Jaur√®s (who went on to become the chief figure of the French socialist Party); Ren√© Viviani and Aristide Briand (both heads of government around the time of the first world war); Alexandre Millerand (head of state after the war). Some socialist- republicans, such as Jaur√®s, ended up drifting to Marxism; others, like Millerand, to a Jacobin-inspired right-wing nationalism: it was never a coherent body of thought, but a catch-all grouping for all those who did not exactly fit into the orthodox Socialist Party or the Radical-Socialist Party. Between 1907 and 1935, socialist-republicans formed several loose parliamentary parties. They were periodically joined by splinters from the orthodox Socialist Party's right-wing. * 1907 to 1911: the Independent Socialist Party, which in 1911 became the PSR; * 1911 to 1935: the main Socialist Republican Party (PSR); * 1919 to 1926: the Socialist Party of France, a splinter of the SFIO's reformist right-wing, which eventually merged into the PSR; * 1928 to 1935: a new party named the Socialist Party of France, which splintered from the PSR; * 1933 to 1935: the 'Jean Jaur√®s' French Socialist Party, another splinter of the SFIO's reformist right-wing.  Component Parties of the Socialist Republican Union  * The Republican- Socialist Party (PRS) This was a parliamentary group formed in 1911 (and revived in 1923 after a brief disappearance) by non-Marxist socialists who declined to join the SFIO and who wished to remain close to the Radicals. It provided a political home to independents elected to parliament who for doctrinal, organisational or personal reasons could not or would not sit among the SFIO or the PRRRS. Consequently it was quite a diffuse organisation borrowing elements from both adjacent parties: some of its members were social-democrats close to the reformist right wing of the SFIO, and others were republicans who overlapped with the left-wing of the Radical-Socialists (and in some cases originally came from this party, as was the case for the Socialist Republican Party's own leader Maurice Viollette) . The party had provided several the major figures of the French republican left, including former premiers Aristide Briand and R√©n√© Viviani.Billard, 1996. *The French Socialist Party. This had originated as a splinter of the SFIO's reformist right-wing in 1919, which briefly merged with the Socialist Republican Party (1926-28) before disagreements over coalition partners prompted it to be revived as a semi-independent parliamentary grouping attached to the PSR). Its main figures were Maxence Bibi√© and Anatole de Monzie. The boundary between this party and the PRS was fluid, and many independents were simply elected as 'Socialist Republicans' and decided for themselves which of the two groups to sit with in parliament. *The Socialist Party of France, labelled the 'Jean Jaur√®s' Socialist Party by its members and the Neo-Socialists by others. This was founded in December 1933 by the veteran socialist leader Pierre Renaudel. The SFIO had a strict policy of non-participation as a minority coalition partner in any government dominated by the bourgeois republican left; Renaudel's faction of thirty reformist socialists sought to enter government, and had been expelled from the SFIO for recurrently supporting centre-left republican cabinets, setting up a dissident social-democratic party to the right of the SFIO and left of the Socialist Republicans.Ruhlmann, 1989.  History  These splinters meant that by 1935 the French Chamber of Deputies contained a diffuse array of about sixty parliamentarians situated between the SFIO and the PRRS, broadly sharing a tradition of non-Marxist reformist socialism and Radical republicanism. After Renaudel's death in the spring of 1935 the PSDF leader Marcel D√©at opened negotiations with the two Socialist Republican parties to coordinate the three groups' activities in parliament. This led first to their establishing an 'inter-group' (combined parliamentary party) in the summer of 1935, and subsequently to the creation of a formal political party in November 1935. The USR was joined by other left-wing independents who were not members of the three original groups, including the dissident socialist Ludovic Frossard and the dissident republican Eug√®ne Frot. In the elections of 1936 the USR aspired to act as a midpoint between traditional Radicalism and orthodox Marxian socialism, expecting that the political crisis since 1933 had weakened voters' satisfaction with the traditional left parties: the Socialists for their rigid refusal to enter a reformist government that could mitigate the effects of the Great Depression; the Radical-Socialists for their ostensible lack of principle for having switched from an alliance with the Socialists to one with the conservatives midway through the legislature. The USR hoped that by offering French voters a synthesis of both main parties, a centre-left republican party committed to a systematic programme of economic state intervention, it could offer a major political alternative. However the formation of the Popular Front made this offer redundant. The SFIO now accepted participation in a coalition government dedicated to socio-economic reforms, while the PRRRS had now publicly positioned itself as a party of anti-fascism and thereby pledged to remain faithful to the electoral alliance of the left. The USR thus failed to achieve the electoral breakthrough it had anticipated. Before the election its merged parliamentary party had contained 47 deputies; after, it had been reduced to a mere 27, fewer than the PSR and PSF had achieved on their own in 1932. The Neo-Socialist wing of the party was the hardest hit - their most prominent figure, Marcel D√©at, lost his seat - and the successful USR deputies were drawn largely from the Socialist Republican wings. The USR participated in the subsequent Popular Front governments of L√©on Blum and Camille Chautemps (1936 to 1938), as well as in the centrist republican governments of √âdouard Daladier and Paul Reynaud (1938 to 1940). SIx of its members held cabinet rank during this period: Paul-Boncour, Frossard, de Monzie, Ramadier, Ramette, Patenotre and Pomaret. The USR was effectively killed by World War II, and its last congress was held in May 1939. Its members took divergent paths during the war: some, like Paul-Boncour, refused to vote plenary powers to Marshal P√©tain, while others actively collaborated with the Vichy Regime and Nazi occupiers, notably D√©at whose National Rally aspired to act as the single party for the collaborationist regime. As a result of these divisions the party was not resurrected after the Liberation: most of its members opted to enter either the SFIO or the new umbrella party of liberal progressives, the Rally of the Republican Left.Bergounioux, 1978.

It was Lowell's sixth book. Notable poems from the collection include \\"Beyond the Alps'\\" (a revised version of the poem that originally appeared in Lowell's book Life Studies), \\"Water,\\" \\"The Old Flame,\\" \\"The Public Garden\\" and the title poem, which is one of Lowell's best- known poems. Style and subject The poems from For the Union Dead built upon the more personal, looser style that Lowell had established in Life Studies. For instance, some of the poems are written in free verse or with a loose meter, and some contain irregular rhymes or no rhymes at all. However, although many of the poems in this volume are personal, their subject matter is different from Life Studies since there aren't any poems that focus on the subject of Lowell's mental illness. Instead, the more personal poems here focus on Lowell's close family relationships, centering on individuals like his daughter (\\"Child's Song\\"), his cousin Harriet Winslow (\\"Soft Wood\\"), his father (\\"Middle Age\\"), and his ex-wife (\\"The Old Flame\\"). However, since these poems don't involve taboo subject matter, they aren't notably \\"confessional\\" (as some of the poems in Life Studies were). The closest that Lowell comes to addressing his mental illness is in the poem \\"Eye and Tooth\\" when, in the final line, he writes, \\"I am tired. Everyone's tired of my turmoil.\\"Lowell, Robert. \\"Eye and Tooth.\\" For the Union Dead. Farrar, Straus, & Giroux, 1964. 22. Other notable subjects in these poems include Lowell's childhood (\\"Those Before Us\\" and \\"The Neo-Classical Urn\\"), and he also writes a number of poems about famous historical figures like Caligula (in \\"Caligula\\") and Jonathan Edwards (in \\"Jonathan Edwards in Western Massachusetts\\")--so multiple subjects of world history are explored in this book (although historical subjects would later become the main focus of his book History, published a few years later). In comparison with Life Studies, Lowell stated, \\"For the Union Dead is more mixed [with different kinds of poems] and the poems are separate entities. I'm after invention rather than memory, and I'd like to achieve some music and elegance and splendor, but not in any programmatic sense. Some of the poems may be close to symbolism.\\"Kunitz, Stanley. \\"Talk with Robert Lowell. The New York Times. 4 October 1964. \\"For the Union Dead\\" (poem) Memorial to Robert Gould Shaw and the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment in Boston that figures prominently in Lowell's poem \\"For the Union Dead\\" Lowell originally wrote the poem \\"For the Union Dead\\" for the Boston Arts Festival in 1960 where he first read it in public.http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/lowell/uniondead.htm The title refers to the 1928 poem \\"Ode to the Confederate Dead\\", by Lowell's former teacher and mentor Allen Tate. At the 1960 festival, Lowell said, \\"Writing is neither transport nor a technique. My own owes everything to a few of our poets who have tried to write directly about what mattered to them, and yet to keep faith with their calling's tricky, specialized, unpopular possibilities for good workmanship. When I finished Life Studies, I was left hanging on a question mark. I don't know whether it is a deathrope or a lifeline.\\"Stanley Kunitz's NY Times Article on Lowell The setting of \\"For the Union Dead\\" is the Boston Common, near the well-known Robert Gould Shaw Memorial by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. In the poem, Lowell's visit to the park, which is being excavated to provide an underground car park, conjures up a series of associations. First, watching the construction of the garage beneath the Common makes him think about his childhood and how Boston had changed; in particular, the South Boston Aquarium, that he'd visited as a child, had been demolished a few years before, in 1954.Website on South Boston Aquarium This leads him to think about the Robert Gould Shaw Memorial and the history associated with the memorial, specifically, the story of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw and the all-black 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry that he led during the Civil War. Finally, Lowell thinks of the then-controversial Civil Rights Movement and the images of the integration of black and white school- children that Lowell had recently seen on television. The final lines of the poem, which read, \\"The Aquarium is gone. Everywhere,/ giant finned cars nose forward like fish;/ a savage servility/ slides by on grease\\" are particularly well known for their rather dark description of the large American cars that were popular at the time, evoking a corrupted consumer society without heroism. \\"The Public Garden\\" The Public Garden in Boston is the setting for the poem \\"The Public Garden.\\" \\"The Public Garden\\" is a revised version of the poem \\"David and Bathsheba in the Public Garden\\" which was originally published in Lowell's third book The Mills of the Kavanaughs. In the version in For the Union Dead, Lowell completely removed from the poem any mention of the Biblical characters of David and Bathsheba who were central to the earlier version. During Lowell's 1963 public reading at the Guggenheim, prior to the publication of For the Union Dead, he explained that many of his readers expressed confusion over the presence of the Biblical characters being located in a modern park in Boston, and according to Lowell, the characters made the poem \\"impenetrable.\\" The revised version of the poem was both shorter and more personal with Lowell (or the poem's narrator) and his lover taking the place of David and Bathsheba.Lowell, Robert and John Berryman. Guggenheim Poetry Reading. New York: Academy of American Poets Archive, 1963. 88 minutes. Response The public reception of For the Union Dead was generally positive. In the New York Times book review, G. S. Fraser wrote that, \\"the book seems to me the most powerful and direct volume of poems [Lowell] has yet published.\\"Fraser, G.S. \\"Amid the Horror, A Song of Praise.\\" The New York Times. 4 Oct. 1964. And the Time magazine book review stated, \\"Lowell is the poet par excellence of the particular. . .

It was a single-engined two-seat low-wing monoplane; only one was built. Development The DH. 81 Swallow Moth was a low-wing cantilever monoplane. This arrangement and its plywood- covered fuselage and closely cowled 80 hp (60 kW) inline Gipsy IV engine gave it a very clean aerodynamic look. The wings carried ailerons that were horn- balanced at the wingtips and the empennage was of characteristic de Havilland form, with a balanced rudder. There was separate tandem seating for two, initially open, but later enclosed with a one-piece hinged cabin top. With this enclosure the aircraft was called the DH.81A and the top speed increased by 12 mph (19 km/h). The main undercarriage was simple, the legs reaching to mid-fuselage in front of the leading edge of the wing, with bracing struts fore and aft to the keel; the later Leopard Moth used a similar arrangement. A small tailskid completed the undercarriage. The Swallow Moth was first flown at Stag Lane Aerodrome by Geoffrey de Havilland on 21 August 1931. Some alteration to the fin followed and the flight testing continued until February 1932. During this time the class B marking E-7 was allocated, but the Swallow Moth never reached the civil register. Its design influenced later de Havilland aircraft, particularly the 1938 Moth Minor.

The battle was the result of an Allied plan to capture the city of Ancona in Italy in order to gain possession of a seaport closer to the fighting so that they could shorten their lines of communication. The Polish 2nd Corps was tasked with capture of the city on 16 June 1944, accomplishing the task a month later on 18 July 1944. Background The Allied advance north meant that the logistics line was in need of a port closer to the front lines than the ports of Pescara and Anzio.Zbigniew Wawer, Zdobycie Bolonii, p.4 As such, two new targets were designated: Ancona on the Adriatic coast, and Livorno on the Tyrrhenian Sea. On 16 June, Polish II Corps under Lieutenant-General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders‚Äîwhich had been taken into British Eighth Army, commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir Oliver Leese, reserve after its efforts in the Battle of Monte Cassino‚Äîwas brought forward once more to relieve British V Corps and tasked with the capture of Ancona. On 17 June, Anders was given command of the Adriatic sector of the Italian theatre. Battle Battle of Ancona (17‚Äì18 July 1944) The first obstacle to cross was the Chienti river. Polish troops reached it on 21 June, and heavy fighting lasted in that region until 30 June. The main offensive on Ancona began on 17 July. Polish armored troops took Monte della Crescia and outflanked German troops defending Ancona. Next, Polish troops secured Casenuove, and neighbouring British and Canadian troops took Montecchio and Croce di San Vincenzo. By the evening of 17 July, Polish troops were near Agugliano, and the following morning they took Offagna. Later that day, Polish troops took Chiaravalle, and armored troops reached the sea, cutting the German defenders of Ancona from the north-west. The Germans were falling back towards the sea, and Polish troops encountered little resistance entering Ancona at 14:30 on 18 July. Aftermath Taking Ancona was the only independent operation of the Polish II Corps. Afterward, the Corps took part in the breaking of the Gothic Line and the Allied spring 1945 offensive which resulted in the surrender of the Axis forces in Italy.

Arch. Mag. lvi. 342-58. http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1386-1421/member/beauchamp- sir-walter-1430 Upon his return to England, Beauchamp is believed to have rendered some service to Henry IV prior to his coronation on 23 October 1399 because only ten days after he received a grant of as much as ¬£40 a year for life or until he was provided with lands to that value. The later of which was granted in August 1400 when he and his bride assumed ownership for the term of their lives the duchy of Lancaster manors of Easterton and Berwick St. James in Wiltshire.Ibid. Royal service Following his acquisition of the duchy of Lancaster manors, Beauchamp was serving as an esquire of the royal household. It is likely that he fought for the king at Shrewsbury in 1403 and campaigned in the north against Archbishop Scrope and the earl of Northumberland in 1405. In 1415 he served as a king's knight in the royal army in France, as part of the retinue of Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester. Career in politics He was appointed High Sheriff of Wiltshire for 1403 and 1407. On his return from France after the Battle of Agincourt he entered parliament in 1416 as Knight of the Shire for Wiltshire and on 16 March 1415/6 was chosen speaker of the House of Commons. However, Sir Walter did not hold the office long, as parliament was dissolved in the same year. In 1417 he served in France again and was at Rouen after its capture in 1419. He remained in Normandy for two years, on his return becoming treasurer of the royal household, treasurer at war and one of the executors of Henry V's will in June 1421. Shortly afterwards he passed into the service of Queen Catherine as steward of her household. He was also selected as one of the commoners to assist in the protection of the young Henry VI. He was employed as counsel by his relative, Richard Beauchamp, earl of Warwick, to argue his claim of precedency before the House of Commons. This quarrel between the Earl of Warwick and John Mowbray, earl marshal, which took up much of the time of the session of 1425, was terminated by the restoration of the forfeited dukedom of Norfolk to Mowbray. In 1429 he was made Master of the Horse. Later life and family Walter Beauchamp, a younger brother of Sir William Beauchamp (d 1421) of Powick, Worcs.

Since December 1985 it has occupied its 6th location, in a former printing works located at 637 South Dearborn Street in the Printer's Row neighborhood. Now also called Grace Place, the historic 3-story redbrick late 19th century Arts and Crafts building is a contributing property in the South Dearborn Street-Printing House Row North Historic District. Grace Place is also listed in the City of Chicago's Chicago Landmarks Historic Resources Survey. Robert, Phillipe, Adaptations: New Uses for Old Buildings, translated from the French by Murray Wyllie, New York: Princeton Architectural Press, 1989, pp. 36-39, Grace Place Episcopal Church, 5 photos and 3 plans, History In 1851, parishioners from Chicago's oldest Episcopal congregation, then about a decade old, Trinity Episcopal Church helped found Grace Episcopal Church in the developing downtown district, which is now known as the Chicago Loop. The first building, a wooden structure, was at Dearborn and Madison Streets, and its first rector, Rev. Cornelius F. Swope, served until 1854. In 1859, the Rev. Clinton Locke became rector, and mostly served in a building at Wabash Avenue and East 8th Street and later at Wabash between 14th and 15th Street, while its parent Trinity Church moved to Jackson street between Michigan Avenue and Wabash by 1860. The Great Chicago Fire in 1871 destroyed both churches, as well as much of the city. That third Grace Church building burned down in 1915, so the congregation rebuilt the partially damaged parish house nearby, and used it for a decade. In 1929, the congregation moved to a new building at 1450 South Indiana Avenue, near St. Luke's Hospital, with which some were associated. The congregation returned to the Loop when it dedicated its fifth building, at 33 West Jackson in 1966. It has been at its current location, in the former Printer's Row district, since 1985. Grace Episcopal Church remains an active parish in the Episcopal Diocese of Chicago. Its current rector is the Rev. Amity Carrubba. Colonel John Mason Loomis was a devout Episcopalian and active in Chicago's Grace Episcopal Church and a big contributor. Architecture Under the supervision of architects Laurence Booth/Paul Hansen and Associates (Booth Hansen), the building's first floor was converted into space for church social functions as well as a center for community meetings, while all of the second floor and most of the third floor were combined into worship space for the church. Booth Hansen carefully avoided the temptation to convert the building's interior into the then popular loft spaces and designed the two- story high worship space so as to minimize the intrusion of the massive wooden support posts into the raised circular sanctuary area. The remainder of the third floor was designed for offices. In 1989 Booth Hansen received the Chicago AIA chapter's 10 year award in interior architecture for Grace Place.

It is the largest tool find from that era in Europe.  History  During the Viking Age, the area where M√§stermyr mire is located used to be a lake. The mire was drained in 1902‚Äì10. In October 1936, the chest was found by farmer Hugo Kraft in a field owned by Emil Norrby in Snoder, Sproge near Hemse. It was found in an area that was plowed for the first time. The chest is on display in the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm.  Find  M√§stermyr chest Back and side of the chest Most of the find had been placed in the chest, but there were also objects around it such as three bronze cauldrons, three bells and a fire-grid of iron. A chain, made up of 26 figure-of-eight shaped links, was wrapped around it. It served both as an extra lock and handle since the chest was too heavy for the original handle. The chest and the other items had probably been placed in a boat which capsized and sank in the lake. Another theory is that the chest was temporarily hidden at the water's edge. The chest contained Viking-era blacksmithing and woodworking tools. It also contained several products of such work, including elements of several locks. The chest and its contents provide a valuable insight into technology during the Viking Age. The chest, long, wide and high, was made of oak with iron hinges and lock. It was intact despite the rough encounter with the plow. It was rectangular with a slightly curved lid and flat bottom. The bottom was joined to the ends via a mortise and through tenon. Pegs were used to attach the sides to the bottom and end pieces. The ends and sides were trapezoidal and slightly angled. A lock wrought from iron was attached to the front side of the chest. Given the wide range of tools and objects in varying styles in the find, and the lack of coins or other chronological markers, it has been impossible to determine an exact date for the chest. The wider term \\"Viking Age\\" around 1000, is used for dating it.  Contents of the chest  The chest contained over 200 tools and blacksmith works or works in progress, making it the largest Viking tool find in Europe. The tools resemble early Roman tools, now on display in museums in Germany, among those the Saalburg. Technological influences spread throughout Europe with the expansion of the Roman empire. The ensuing trade carried ideas and craftsmanship further to regions far from Rome. The contents of the chest indicate that it belonged to a travelling craftsman who made repairs and produced new items. The tools show that he was a smith and a carpenter, and had some knowledge of locks, coppersmithing and coopering. Among the items were three padlocks of a design inspired by Roman locks and of the same kind that were found at excavations in Birka. = Contents = The chest The fire-grid Some of the tools and objects in the chest:  Present-day replicas  Being one of the most complete collections of Viking tools in good condition, the chest and its contents is being replicated by enthusiasts all over the world. The tools and the chest are being made using the same techniques as the originals.  References  External links  *Toolbox from M√§stermyr The Swedish History Museum.

Roger Hunt (died c. 1455) was an English MP and Speaker of the House of Commons. Life He was of obscure origins, but acquired the manor of Molesworth in Huntingdonshire and acquired a circle of influential friends such as Sir John Tiptoft and John Mowbray, the future Duke of Norfolk. About 1402, he leased a London house, perhaps while training as a lawyer at Lincoln's Inn, and became royal attorney for the common pleas, under Tiptoft's patronage, from 1408 to 1410. In 1407, he was returned as knight of the shire for Huntingdonshire, the first of eighteen times he was elected to parliament, being returned on every occasion except one (December 1421) between then and 1433. On three occasions (1414, 1416, and 1420) he chose to represent Bedfordshire, where he had interests at Chawston, instead of Huntingdonshire. He was elected Speaker of the House in 1420 and again in 1433. Following his parliamentary career he was appointed High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire for 1433 and 1434.

The MVS was formed on 1 April 1994, a day after the Royal Naval Auxiliary Service was disbanded. The RNXS operated small ships such as fleet tenders and inshore minesweepers and ran Naval Control of Shipping centres ashore but was disbanded following the end of the Cold War. While many of the best aspects of RNXS operating procedures and traditions survive in the MVS, it is emphatically a civilian, but uniformed, charity whose vessels fly a defaced Red Ensign. However constructive links with the Royal Navy continue at many levels, including University RN Units. There are many ex-RN members in the MVS, and more are always welcome. Over the years MVS volunteers have achieved much. Among the many occasions when they made a difference was during the MSC Napoli salvage when the MVS played a significant role ashore and afloat and was commended by the then SOSREP, Robin Middleton. More recently the MVS had a supporting role during the 2012 Summer Olympics. Its London Units were involved in an extended deployment as part of the Environment Agency's security operation for the Olympic Rowing and Kayak Sprint events held at Eton Dorney Lake. The City of London Unit's Nelson 45 launch, Londinium 1 and three RIBs were based at Boveney Lock on the Non-tidal Thames for two weeks. The MVS craft had the privilege of being invited to take part in celebratory processions for Team GB's many gold medal winners down the river, from the Olympic Venue to Team GB's riverside hotel. The MVS also assisted Weymouth Harbour Authority during the Olympics. Poole Unit's ex-Customs launch Avocet, and RIBS from Portsmouth, Christchurch, Bournemouth, Weymouth and Portland Units worked to the Weymouth Harbour Master's instructions, patrolling the port's busy anchorages and approaches. The MVS's national training vessel East Sussex 1 sailed to Weymouth to act as a floating hotel and control centre for the crews of the other craft. The MVS's work supporting the Olympics was one of the major factors that led to it receiving the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Volunteering Award 2012. Maritime Volunteer Services recognised at St. James Palace The Maritime Volunteer Service has around 400 members in 27 units around the United Kingdom. Most units meet weekly for training, which is put into practice afloat using a range of craft including RIBs, launches, dories, and the national training vessel East Sussex 1. The MVS maintains strong links with local authorities, harbour boards and other maritime organisations. In 2014 the MVS marked its 20th Anniversary at an official dinner in Portsmouth, where the guest of honour was Vice-Admiral Sir Alan Massey KCB, CBE, RN Chief Executive of the MCA. MCA Chief Executive guest of honour at MVS 20th Anniversary Dinner Recognition On 7 May 1997, the then Armed Forces Minister, Dr John Reid, announced during a visit to the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth that the Royal Navy would give formal recognition to the Maritime Volunteer Service. In his remarks, he said that the Royal Navy's recognition is a tribute to the important role that the MVS play in the education and training of young people in nautical skills. Formal Recognition, publications.parliament.uk In January 2016 the First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Philip Jones KCB ADC issued a new Defence Instruction and Notice again recognising the MVS. The Defaced Ensign The MVS Defaced Ensign On 2 September 1998, a Warrant was issued giving permission for the MVS to wear a Red Ensign bearing the Service's \\"V\\" and \\"Anchor\\" logo and naval crown. The logo was designed by Commander Bruce Nicholls OBE RN, and this is only the thirty-fifth designed Red Ensign approved for use worldwide. Of that total six are flown by UK public institutions such as Trinity House, the RNLI and the Scout Association, six by dependent territories and five by Commonwealth countries and provinces. The remainder have been granted to privileged yacht clubs around the world. The MVS Ensign accurately reflects the Service's aims in promoting maritime skills amongst local communities in ports and harbours around Britain's coast. http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb~mvs.html Aims & Objectives The MVS objects are: To advance the education and training of the members of the charity and the general public in all aspects of maritime and communication skills and knowledge.

Life The son and heir of Sir Edmund Oldhall of Narford, Bodney, and East Dereham, Norfolk, by Alice, daughter of Geoffrey de Fransham of the same county, he was born about 1390. As an esquire in the retinue of Thomas Beaufort, 1st Earl of Dorset, he was present at the siege of Rouen in 1418‚Äì19. He also served under Thomas Montacute, 4th Earl of Salisbury in the expedition for the relief of Crevant, July 1423, and won his spurs at the battle of Verneuil on 17 August 1424. About this date he was made seneschal of Normandy. In the subsequent invasion of Maine and Anjou he further distinguished himself, and was appointed constable of Montsoreau and governor of St. Laurent des Mortiers. In the summer of 1426 Oldhall was employed in Flanders on a mission to Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy concerning Jacqueline, Duchess of Gloucester, then a prisoner in the duke's hands. In October 1428 he was detached by the council of Normandy to strengthen the garrison of Argentan, then in danger of falling by treachery into the hands of Jean II, Duke of Alen√ßon. He was present at the great council held at Westminster, 24 April‚Äì8 May 1434, on the conduct of the war in France, and also at the council of 24 February 1438‚Äì9. In 1440 he was chamberlain to Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, and a member of his council, and the following year was made feoffee to his use and that of his duchess Cecilia of certain royal manors. In the struggle for the retention of Normandy he commanded the castle of La Fert√© Bernard, which fell into the hands of the French on 16 August 1449. Oldhall was with the Duke of York in Wales in September 1450; was returned to parliament for Hertfordshire on 15 October of the same year, and on 9 November following was chosen Speaker of the House of Commons. Indicted in 1452 for complicity in the insurrection of Jack Cade and the subsequent rebellion of the Duke of York, he was found guilty, outlawed, and attainted on 22 June. He took sanctuary in the chapel royal of St. Martins-le-Grand, where he remained in custody of the king's valet until after the First Battle of St Albans on 22 May 1455, but obtained his release and the reversal of his outlawry and attainder on 9 July. He was again attainted in November 1459 as a fautor and abettor of the recent Yorkist insurrection; but on the accession of Edward IV of England the attainder was treated as null and void. He died in London in November 1460, and was buried in St Michael Paternoster Royal. Besides his Norfolk estates Oldhall held (by purchase) the manors of Eastwich and Hunsdon, Hertfordshire. On the latter estate he built, at the cost of seven thousand marks, a castellated brick mansion. It remained in the Crown, notwithstanding the avoidance of his second attainder, and was converted by Henry VIII into a royal residence. In 1558 it was granted by Elizabeth I to Sir Henry Cary. It was later transformed into the existing Hunsdon House. Family Oldhall married Margaret, daughter of William Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby de Eresby, who was buried in the church of the Grey Friars, London. By her he had issue an only daughter Mary, whose husband, Walter Gorges of Wraxall, Somerset (ancestor of Sir Ferdinando Gorges), succeeded to Oldhall's Norfolk estates, and died in September 1466. Edmund Oldhall, Bishop of Meath (died 1459) was his brother.

Life James was the son of Sir James Strangeways of Whorlton, Yorkshire appointed Chief Justice of North Wales. In London he was a King's Serjeant and then a justice of the common pleas in 1426Plea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas; National Archives; CP 40/717; Year 1440; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/AALT1/H6/CP40no717/bCP40no717dorses/IMG_1902.htm; 4th entry as defendant against John Fastolf, knight by his wife Joan, daughter of Nicholas Orrell. He was appointed High Sheriff of Yorkshire in 1446, 1453, and 1469 and was returned for the county to the parliaments of 1449 and 1460 and 1461‚Äì2. A Yorkist, he fought at the 1st battle of St Albans in 1455, Blore Heath in 1459, and Wakefield in 1460. His career was informative during that year, at the start of which in March the Lancastrians confirmed his post as High Sheriff of the North Riding. His previous conduct might have hinted at other allegiances for in 1459 the king appointed a northern embassy to Scotland, but Strangeways refused to travel. That summer Edward, Earl of March, headed a Yorkist invasion force that marched into the Midlands. On 30 July 1460 they decisively defeated the King's army. But by that time the administration had already removed Strangeways from his post. The parliament of October 1460 was almost wholly Yorkist. Strangeways was returned for Yorkshire with his brother-in-law, the other 'knight of the shire', Sir Thomas Montford. Reappointed as a JP of the North Riding, he rode with the Yorkist nobles into southern Yorkshire to arrest and imprison the Lancastrian knights there. Strangeways made extensive use of an arbitrary piece of law Scandalum magnatum widely abused by the Yorkist regime. It enabled the arrest for just cause for uttering alleged falsehoods, and artisans who breached patent laws in manufacture. Its application was generalised by court officials. When Somerset's army defeated and killed the duke of York at Wakefield at the end of the year the earl of March was not present. It is likely Strangeways was captured but released by Edward when he was reported as killed at the Towton on 10 May 1461. He was immediately reinstated as JP for West Riding with his son as JP for North Riding. He was charged by the charismatic soldier-king to find and imprison leading Lancastrian rebels. Dr John Morton and Sir John Conyers were leading members of Henry VI's affinity. Morton was a former Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and a senior court official. Conyers‚Äô wife was a co-heiress to the Darcy fortune into which Strangeways had married. This was taxation by stealth, later known as Morton's Fork, one of Edward's cunning dynastic devices. The Commission of Oyer et Terminer was a State Trial that aimed at the truth about bringing lawless opponents of the regime to book through summary procedures. King Edward thanked his faithful retainer after his great victories of 1461 when the Yorkist army marched into London to announce a new reign. Edward was generous to his friends, but wrathful to those who were disloyal. Strangeways' fealty was rewarded with Speaker of the House of Commons in the first parliament of Edward IV which met in November 1461.Official Return of Members of Parliament, I, 340, 356, App.XXIV.; J.S. Roskell, Parliaments and Politics in Late Medieval England, II, 279. For the first time in English history the speaker addressed the king, immediately after his presentation and allowance, in a long speech reviewing the state of affairs and recapitulating the history of the civil war. The parliament transacted hardly any business other than numerous acts of attainder against Lancastrians. It was prorogued to 6 May 1462 and then dissolved. Strangeways, who was paid 200 marks for being a 'diligent' Speaker, then served on various commissions for the defence of the kingdom and suppression of rebellions. He also sat regularly on the commissions of the peace for the North and West Ridings of Yorkshire. With the death of the Earl of Salisbury, Strangeways drew closer to the Neville faction and Warwick the Kingmaker from 1463 onwards. He remained a northerner at heart in the fastness of Yorkshire dominated by the Neville family and its castles.J.S. Roskell, The Speakers in the Commons and House of Parliament, 1376-1523, MUP, 1965, p.271. He held the powerful position of Chief Justice of Durham Palatinate in the Yorkist interest until the Readeption. Sir James‚Äô second marriage was to Elizabeth Eure. An ancient Norman family, de Eure could trace their lineage through the Plantagenets, securing Strangeways immortality among the noble elites.

He was a prominent lawyer and a trusted councillor of King Henry VIII, and was elected Speaker of the House of Commons in 1515. Family Neville was the fifth son of George Neville, 4th Baron Bergavenny (1436‚Äì1492), by his first wife, Margaret Fenn (d. 28 September 1485), the daughter and heir of Hugh Fenne. Career Mereworth church, where Sir Thomas Neville is buried Although there is no formal record of his legal education, Neville was a member of Gray's Inn, and by 1514 had begun to oversee the legal process by which tenants in chief of the Crown sued out their liveries to obtain possession of their estates. In 1529 he was appointed to supervise the suing out of all liveries involving lands in England, Wales and Calais. Between the years 1516 and 1527 he was also in frequent attendance at meetings of King Henry VIII's council, and was active in both Star Chamber and the Court of Requests. It is said that by 1522, of the Masters of Requests only he and Sir Thomas More had access to the King. Details of Neville's early Parliamentary career are unclear, although it is likely he represented a constituency in Kent. On 8 February 1515, he was chosen Speaker of the House of Commons, and knighted by Henry VIII in the presence of both houses, 'a mark of distinction thought to be without precedent'. After his term as Speaker, he appears to have left Parliament, but continued to serve at court, where he had livery in Henry VIII's household in 1519. He was a signatory to at least two treaties, and was present at both the Field of Cloth of Gold and Henry VIII's meeting with Emperor Charles V. He is recorded as having received a New Year's gift from the King in 1533, and was among the courtiers present when Anne of Cleves was welcomed at Dover. In 1521 his eldest brother, George Neville, 5th Baron Bergavenny, was disgraced, and was compelled to sell his principal manor of Birling in Kent to the Crown. In 1538 another of his brothers, Sir Edward Neville, was executed. However the misfortunes which befell his brothers appear to have had no effect on Neville's own career. In 1535, he was involved in unsuccessful negotiations to marry his only child, Margaret, to Gregory Cromwell, the son of Henry VIII's chief minister, Thomas Cromwell. Thomas Cromwell is said to have chosen Margaret's eventual husband, Sir Robert Southwell. Although he did not acquire extensive lands, Neville was wealthy enough to lend money to other courtiers, including the King's brother-in-law, Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and Henry Percy, 5th Earl of Northumberland. Neville made his will on 23 May 1542, appointing as executors his cousin, Sir Thomas Willoughby, Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and Sir John Baker. He died six days later, and was buried in Mereworth church in Kent, where he is commemorated by a memorial brass. Marriages and issue Neville married firstly Katherine (n√©e Dacre), widow of George, 8th Baron FitzHugh (d. 28 January 1513), and daughter of Humphrey Dacre, 1st Baron Dacre of Gilsland and Mabel Parr, the daughter of Sir Thomas Parr (d. 24 November 1464),; . by whom he had an only child, Margaret Neville, who on 1 May 1536 married Sir Robert Southwell.

Humphrey was educated at Gray's Inn, where he was elected Lent Reader in 1517. He had been on the commission of the peace both for Essex and Suffolk since 1509 at least. Career Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk was a cousin of the Wingfields, Humphrey being one of his trustees. and probably through his influence Wingfield was introduced at court. In 1515 he was appointed chamberlain to Suffolk's wife Mary Tudor, Queen of France, and was apparently resident in her house. On 28 May 1517 he was nominated upon the royal commission for inquiring into illegal inclosures in Suffolk. He appears to have acted in 1518, together with his eldest brother, Sir John Wingfield, as a financial agent between the government and the Duke of Suffolk. On 6 November 1520 Wingfield was chosen High Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk, and on 14 November was appointed a commissioner of gaol delivery for Essex. In 1523 and 1524 he was a commissioner of subsidy for Suffolk and for the town of Ipswich and also MP for Ipswich, his main seat being at Brantham nearby. On 26 June 1525 he was appointed a commissioner of assize for Suffolk, On 5 February 1526 he was a legal member of the king's council. He was in favour with Thomas Wolsey, and he took an active part in the establishment of the \\"Cardinal's College\\" at Ipswich in September 1528. On 11 June 1529 he was nominated by Wolsey one of a commission of twenty-one lawyers presided over by John Taylor to hear cases in chancery, and on the following 3 November he was returned to parliament for Great Yarmouth. In 1530 the fall of Wolsey brought with it the forfeiture of his college at Ipswich, and Wingfield was consulted as counsel, with a view to securing the exemption of the college from the penalties of Wolsey's praemunire. On the other hand, he was nominated by the crown on 14 July 1530 a commissioner to inquire into Wolsey's possessions in Suffolk. In this capacity he, sitting with three other commissioners at Woodbridge, Suffolk, returned a verdict on 19 September that the college and its lands were forfeited to the king. He was at the same time high steward of St. Mary Mettingham, another Suffolk college, and under-steward in Suffolk of the estates of St. Osyth, Essex. On 9 February 1533 the commons presented Wingfield to the king as their speaker. According to Eustace Chapuys, the king knighted him on this occasion. He is styled 'Sir' in a petition of this year, and frequently afterwards; but according to the list in Walter Metcalfe's Book of Knights he was not dubbed before 1537. During his speakership were passed the acts severing the church of England from the Roman obedience and affirming the royal supremacy; Wingfield supported Henry's policy. Parliament was dissolved on 4 April 1536. On the outbreak of the Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536 Wingfield was one of the Suffolk gentry upon whom the government relied for aid. He justified Thomas Cromwell's opinion of him by opposing the incitements of the friars and other disaffected ecclesiastics. He was nominated in 1536 a commissioner for the valuation of the lands and goods of religious houses in Norfolk and Suffolk. For these services he was rewarded by a grant in tail male, dated 29 June 1537, of the manors of Netherhall and Overhall in Dedham, Essex, and all the lands in Dedham belonging to the suppressed nunnery of Campsey, Suffolk, also of the manor of Crepinghall in Stutton, Suffolk, and all lands there belonging to the late priory of Colne Comitis (Earls Colne) in Essex. According to a letter written by him to Cromwell soon after this grant he had then lost half his estate by his wife's death. On 4 July 1538 he was nominated upon a special commission of oyer and terminer for treasons in six of the eastern counties. He was also commissioned to survey the defensive points of the coast when in 1539 there were apprehensions of an invasion. He was among the knights appointed to receive Anne of Cleves in January 1540. After the conviction of Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter he received a grant of a lease of his lands in Lalford Says, Ardelegh, Colchester, and Mile- End, in Essex and Suffolk. He was again returned to Parliament as the Member for Great Yarmouth in 1542. Wingfield died on 23 October 1545. Family Wingfield married between 1502 and 1512 Anne, daughter and heiress of Sir John Wiseman of Essex, and widow of Gregory Adgore, Edgore, or Edgar, serjeant-at- law. His son and heir, Robert, married Bridget, daughter of Sir Thomas Pargeter, knt., alderman and lord mayor of London in 1530. His daughter Anne married Sir Alexander Newton.
