It is known both as a busy urban highway in Greenville, South Carolina and a scenic back-road in Western North Carolina. Route description In South Carolina, US 276 only runs in Greenville County, for a total of ; beginning at the I-385/I-185 junction in Mauldin. The US Highway then runs north to the City of Greenville, then to Travelers Rest, and then Marietta before climbing into North Carolina. A two- mile portion of US 276 between Greenville and Travelers Rest is an expressway complete with shoulders, exits, a grass median, and a speed limit of 55 miles per hour. In Travelers Rest, a Downtown Revitalization Plan has reduced US 276 from four lanes down to two; added trees, on-street parking, a new park, and other improvements. After Marietta, US 276 climbs about to Caesars Head State Park in the Blue Ridge Mountains, from the North Carolina border. At the border, the US Highway crosses the Eastern Continental Divide at above sea level. In North Carolina, US 276 traverses through Transylvania and Haywood counties, for a total of . Between the towns of Brevard and Waynesville in North Carolina, US 276 travels through the Pisgah National Forest and is a route heavily traveled by recreationalists. The road follows the Davidson River and a tributary upstream before climbing the Pisgah Ridge and crossing the Blue Ridge Parkway at its top, then descending by the Pigeon River and the Shining Rock Wilderness. Many trailheads used for hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding lie along US 276 in this area and roads connecting to it. Drivers will also find roadside campgrounds, picnic areas, waterfalls, and two museums ‚Äî the Pisgah Center for Wildlife Education and the Cradle of Forestry in America ‚Äî along the road or within a short distance of it. North of Waynesville, US 276 continues through Lake Junaluska, where it joins US 19 to Maggie Valley, then runs north to I-40 at Cove Creek. US 276 is signed east- west in South Carolina and north-south in North Carolina; which is why it is listed as having an eastern and northern terminus. US 276 overlaps with the Forest Heritage Scenic Byway, which is a North Carolina Scenic Byway, National Forest Scenic Byway and National Scenic Byway, that traverses between Pisgah Forest and Woodrow. History Northbound US 276, in Brevard US 276 was established in 1932, traversing from Laurens, South Carolina to Brevard, North Carolina; it replaced US 76 between Laurens to Greenville, overlapped with US 25 to Travelers Rest, replaced SC 284/NC 284 to Brevard. Around 1939, US 276 was extended north from Brevard, via Pisgah Forest along the old Pisgah Motor Road, to Waynesville, ending at Main Street. In the 1940s, US 276 was changed to its current routing around the downtown area of Greenville, which established US 276 Business by 1948; the business route would be later replaced by I-85 Business by 1968-70. In 1957 or 1958, US 276 was moved onto new freeway south of Mauldin to just south of Fountain Inn; its old route was replaced by SC 417 between Mauldin-Simpsonville and SC 14 to Fountain Inn. Between 1959-61, US 276's realignment onto new freeway was complete with a connection with I-26 in Clinton, the remainder of its former route to Laurens was replaced by SC 14. Also around 1959, US 276 was extended north again to Lake Junaluska, North Carolina, replacing another section of NC 284. By 1968, a widened 4-lane road was completed between Dellwood and Cove Creek, completing a temporary connection between two completed sections of I-40. This section became the final extension north of US 276, replacing the last remaining section NC 284; temporary I-40 lasted till 1974 (when the section between exits 20-27 was completed). Around 1985, the Mauldin-Clinton freeway was renumbered to I-385; truncating US 276 to its current eastern terminus in Mauldin. =North Carolina Highway 284= NC 284 was a former state highway in the Mountains Region of the state of North Carolina. Its routing through the Great Smoky Mountains was demoted to Old NC 284 (Cove Creek Road) and today remains primitive road; it is thus unpaved and is maintained by the National Park Service. The rest of the old route, which lies to the south, was replaced segment by segment by U.S. Highway 276 from 1939 to 1968, when the last section from Maggie Valley north to the newly constructed Interstate 40 in Cove Creek was replaced by the U.S. highway.

The station is the penultimate one on the High Barnet branch of the Northern line, between Woodside Park and High Barnet stations, in . It was first built in 1872. It is on the north side of Totteridge Lane (A5109), to the east of the Dollis Brook (the traditional boundary between Totteridge and Whetstone) so narrowly in the latter.Google Maps - Totteridge and Whetstone Tube Station History The Totteridge & Whetstone station was planned by the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway (EH&LR;) and was originally opened as Whetstone and Totteridge on 1 April 1872 by the Great Northern Railway (which had taken over the EH&LR;).Clive's Underground Line Guides - Northern Line, Dates The station was on a branch of a line whose main part ran from Finsbury Park to Edgware via Highgate. After the 1921 Railways Act created the Big Four railway companies the line was, from 1923, part of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The section of the High Barnet branch north of East Finchley was incorporated into the London Underground network through the \\"Northern Heights\\" project which began in the late 1930s. Totteridge and Whetstone station was first served by Northern line trains on 14 April 1940 and, after a period where the station was serviced by both operators, LNER services ended in 1941. British Rail (the successor to the LNER) freight trains continued to serve the station's goods yard until 1 October 1962, when it was closed. Station facilities The station retains much of its original Victorian architectural character today.Railfanning London's Railways - Northern line The station is not wheelchair accessible owing to flights of stairs to the two platforms. The station has in the 21st century undergone subtle changes to enable the policy of no ticket offices, chiefly: *an automatic double-wide access, disabled and buggy-friendly barrier *A help desk instead of the ticket office. The station is not often manned but is during peak hours. The station has a passenger hall, four gates, two toilets (a female toilet on the southbound platform and a male toilet on the northbound platform), payphones, a car park and waiting rooms.Totteridge & Whetstone Underground Station Services and connections Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 3‚Äì6 minutes between 6:04 and midnight in both directions.

Within the historic boundaries of Monmouthshire, it became an early centre of the Industrial Revolution in Wales. The historic Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond, Virginia, United States was named in honour of the town. The relevant wards (Tredegar Central and West, Sirhowy and Georgetown) collectively listed the town's population as 15,103 in the UK 2011 census. History =Origin of the name= The original Tredegar is in Coedcernyw by Newport, and is nowadays more usually known in English as (in order to avoid confusion) Tredegar House (or Tredegar Park). Older forms of the name show it to be Tredegyr (this form is found in 1550) (by the modern Welsh period generally this final \\"y\\" would have become \\"e\\". In south-eastern Welsh, or Gwentian, which is the variety of Welsh spoken historically in Tredegar, this would have in turn become \\"a\\", as with Gwentian \\"Merchar\\" (Wednesday), standard Welsh \\"Mercher\\", from older Welsh \\"Merchyr\\"). In 1800 Samuel Homfray, who had married into the Morgan of Tredegar family, formed a company to produce iron which was named the Tredegar Iron Company ‚Äì the land where he extracted and treated the ore belonged to his father-in-law and was a part of the Tredegar Estate. The company's buildings appeared on an 1832 Ordnance Survey map as Tredegar Iron Works. Tredegyr is \\"farmstead of Tegyr\\" (tre, a form of tref = farmstead) + soft mutation (t > d) + Tegyr. A Brythonic form *Tecorix (fair king) might be supposed, as such a form would have resulted in Welsh \\"Tegyr\\" following normal processes in the development of Welsh from Brythonic. There is a similar name in Denbighshire ‚Äì Botegyr, meaning \\"Tegyr‚Äôs dwelling\\", < Bod Degyr < (bod = dwelling) + (soft mutation t > d) + (Tegyr). The local form of the name was in fact Tredecar (with ‚Äúc‚Äù [k] instead of ‚Äúg‚Äù). This feature, typical of Gwentian, is known as ‚Äúprovection‚Äù (calediad in Welsh) and involves the devoicing of stops. In this way ‚Äúb > p‚Äù, ‚Äúd > t‚Äù and ‚Äúg > c‚Äù. The form is to be found in the title of the folk song ‚ÄúAr Ben Waun Tredecar‚Äù (\\"At the Top of Waun Tredegar\\" (i.e. Tredegar Mountain) by the group Yr Hwntws. There was also a shortened form Decar ‚Äì the loss of a pre-tonic syllable is not unusual in Welsh and a number of place-names show this feature. Examples in spoken Welsh are ceffyle > ffyle (horses), afale > fale (apples), ysgubor > sgubor (barn), ystafell > stafell (room), eisteddfod > steddfod. Folk etymology The origin of the name Tredegar has been said to be \\"tref y deg erw\\" or \\"tre'r deg erw\\" (\\"(the) farm (of) the thirty acres\\"). \\"Tref\\" is an older form of \\"tre\\"; \\"y\\" is the definite article after a consonant, and \\"'r\\" is the definite article after a vowel. Deg erw is Welsh for \\"ten acres\\", literally \\"ten acre\\". In Welsh place names the linking definite article is often dropped, hence pairs such as \\"Glan-y-m√¥r, Glan-m√¥r\\" (the sea's edge) or \\"Cae'r Maen, Cae Maen\\" (the field of the standing stone). Thus \\"tref deg erw\\" would not be an impossible name morphologically, though it would not be within the usual pattern of Welsh place names (tref + a defined acreage does not occur). Another explanation sometimes found is that the origin of the name is \\"tri deg erw\\" i.e. thirty acres, by way of an altered form of tri-deg-ar. \\"Tri-deg\\" (three tens, literally \\"three ten\\") is thirty, but as a numeral it is a recent innovation in Welsh, since \\"deg-ar-hugain\\" (ten on twenty) is the traditional numeral. In both of the above interpretations (\\"ten-acre-farm\\", or \\"thirty acres\\") it is supposed that \\"erw\\" has been reduced to \\"er\\" through the loss of the final vowel \\"w\\", and the resulting final syllable \\"er\\" has become final \\"ar\\". This would be consistent with features of Gwentian Welsh. Some south-eastern field names show this reduction ‚Äì for example, Dwyar, a field name in Penderyn (dwy erw = two acres (literally \\"two acre\\") > dwyer > dwyar). So \\"tre deg erw\\" is plausible morphologically, but is not the origin of the name \\"Tredegar\\". In the second case, \\"tri-deg\\" would hardly change to \\"tre-deg\\" and so \\"tri deg erw\\" could not have resulted in \\"Tredegar\\". In addition, neither in the case of \\"ten acres\\" nor in that of \\"thirty acres\\" is there any indication of what land area is being referred to. =Pre-industrialisation= Tredegar grew as a developed town thanks to the natural resources it had within the Sirhowy Valley, namely: *Iron ore *Coal with which to produce coke *Power, from the fast-flowing Sirhowy River *Wood, which could be cut for buildings and pit props, and burnt for fuel Hence by the start of the 1700s, the upper Sirhowy Valley was a natural well-wooded valley, consisting of a few farms and the occasional small iron works where iron ore and coal naturally had occurred together. =Industrialisation= The first recorded iron works in the Sirhowy Valley was Pont Gwaith Yr Hearn, developed by two Bretons and worked by men from Penydarren, Merthyr Tydfil. The Sirhowy Iron Works was erected in 1750 by Mr Kettle of Shropshire. In 1778 Kettle sold this ironworks to Thomas Atkinson and William Barrow, who came to the area from London.\\"A look at Old Tredegar in photographs\\" Volume 1 Philip Prosser Old Bakehouse Publications 1990 They developed it as the first coal fired furnace, so men were employed to dig coal at Bryn Bach and Nantybwch, the first small scale coal mining operation in the area. The furnace and hence the business failed in 1794. =Tredegar Ironworks= In 1797, Samuel Homfray, with partners Richard Fothergill and the Matthew Monkhouse built a new furnace, leasing the land from the Tredegar Estate in Newport.B. Gardner's History of Tredegar and other information This created the new Sirhowy Ironworks, that were in 1800 to become the Tredegar Iron Company, named in honour of the Tredegar Estate at Tredegar House and Tredegar Park in Newport in the south of the county. In 1891, the company ceased production of iron, but continued to develop coal mines and produce coal. The former Tredegar Ironworks were effectively abandoned, with Whiteheads taking over the southern section of the site from 1907. In 1931, they also closed down their operations, moving everything to their Newport works. TICC continued to develop coal mines and work pits, until it was nationalised in 1946, becoming part of the National Coal Board. = Tredegar Circle = Samuel Homfray, an iron master who managed to obtain a large parcel of land in and around Tredegar, is to thank for Tredegar Circle and the wide streets running out from it. He showed a great concern about the state of the current streets and how narrow they were, deciding that his new town would have wide streets running out from a central place. Tredegar Circle was first known as 'The Square', but as buildings and shops developed around it people within Tredegar began to refer to it as 'The Circle'. The town clock which stands in the middle of Tredegar Circle was once where the town stocks resided, with there being records of people being put into the stocks to be punished for petty misdemeanours. People being punished within the stocks would have their legs trapped in the stocks, being kept outside for hours in all weather conditions. Prostitution was rife within Tredegar Circle, almost having a reputation of being a 'red light district' in the earlier days. Tredegar Circle was also seen as being an important 'shopping centre', many local tradespeople would go there to set up stalls and sell their wears to the people within Tredegar before the town clock was erected. Horses and carts loaded with goods would clatter around Tredegar Circle, with almost every type of produce being available to buy within Tredegar Circle. Tredegar Circle is also known for the pubs that occupy it, although there have been many that have closed down over the years such as the Greyhound Inn and the Freemasons, both once very popular with local workers. There have been many reported arrests within Tredegar Circle, in both present and earlier days, due to drunken and disorderly behaviour. Riots The town is known for its three major riots. In 1868 there were the election riots, which took place after the locals' favourite candidate, Colonel Clifford, was not elected. Secondly in 1882 there was a major anti-Irish riot in Tredegar. There had been a large Irish community in Tredegar since the 1850s, and for a while there had been tensions. Reports from the time vary, however where they all concur includes the fact the riot began with stone throwing and quickly escalated with Irishmen's homes being destroyed and furniture burned in the streets. The Irish were run out of Tredegar and some were beaten. Troops from Newport and Cardiff had to be called in to quell the violence Thirdly, there were the anti-Jewish riots of 1911, which some called a pogrom, when Jewish shops were ransacked and the army had to be brought in.BBC News, 19 August 2011: History debate over anti-Semitism in 1911 Tredegar riot Though Jewish businesses and property were attacked, nobody was killed in this riot. Foundation Samuel Homfray and his partners needed accommodation for their workers, and so needed to develop a suitable town. The land on the eastside of the Sirhowy river was owned by Lt.Col. Sir Charles Gould Morgan who granted a lease in 1799 to build Tredegar Ironworks Company. In 1800, Homfray married Sir Charles daughter Jane, and hence improved his lease terms. The west bank of the river was owned by Lord Tredegar, and hence in the short term remained undeveloped. Homfray was a hard task master. He sold franchises to business people who wanted to operate within his town, from which he would take a percentage. He paid his workers in his own private coinage, so that they could not easily spend their wages outside the town. However, the opportunity to work created a boom town, which with a parish population of 1,132 in 1801 had boomed to 34,685 by 1881, in part boosted by the laying of the stretch of horse drawn track to Newport in 1805. But all of this development came at a price. Adrian Vaughn, in his 1985 book \\"Grub, Water & Relief,\\" mentions that in 1832 John Gooch took a managerial post in the Tredegar iron works: There were several cholera epidemics in the town in the 19th century, and a dedicated cholera burial ground was established at Cefn Golau. Governance =Links with the Labour Party= Tredegar has strong links with prominent Labour MPs and the history of the Labour Party and the Labour Movement in Britain as a whole. It was the birthplace of Aneurin Bevan, who was responsible for the introduction of the British National Health Service (NHS), and who in the 1920s was involved in the management of Tredegar General Hospital. Neil Kinnock, leader of the Labour Party from 1983 to 1992, was born in Tredegar in 1942 and lived there for most of his early life, attending the town's Georgetown Infants and Junior Schools between 1947 and 1953.The Georgetown Schools (1877‚Äì1989) Clarice Brown Starling Press, Newport 1989 His predecessor as leader, Michael Foot, was Labour MP for the local constituency ‚Äî Ebbw Vale ‚Äî during his time as party leader. As part of the once safe Labour constituency of Blaenau Gwent, Tredegar was for a period represented by the independent left-wing politician Dai Davies until the general election of 2010, when it reverted to Labour. Architecture =Bedwellty House= Bedwellty House is a Grade II listed house and gardens. Originally a \\"low thatched-roof cottage\\", the old house was renovated in 1809. The present Bedwellty House was built in 1818 as a home for Samuel Homfray, whose Iron and Coal Works were the main local employers for much of the 19th century. The surrounding Victorian garden and park, designed originally as a Dutch garden around which one could walk or ride without being confronted by gate, fence or outside features, contains the Long Shelter, also a Grade II listed structure built for the Chartist Movement. =Town Clock= One of Tredegar's main attributes is the Town Clock, dominating the southern part of the town centre. The clock was made by JB Joyce & Co of Whitchurch, Shropshire and was the idea of Mrs. R. P. Davies, the wife of the Tredegar Ironworks manager, who had decided that she wanted to present a \\"lofty illuminated clock\\", and it was she who decided that it would be erected in the Circle.Old Tredegar Volume One W.Scandlett > \\"The clock tower is seventy-two feet high. The foundation is of masonry, on > which is surmounted the cast-iron base which has four arms from each corner > to a distance of sixty feet at a depth of five feet and six inches (152 mm) > below ground level.

Culture and leisure Tredegar is 'The Home of Champions' namely the world- famous Tredegar Town Band. The band is currently ranked number 2 in the brass band world rankings above top brass banding names such as Brighouse & Rastrick, Grimethorpe Colliery & Black Dyke. The musical origins of the band can be traced back to 1849 when a local brass band from the Welsh Valley town was reported to have led a procession to celebrate the opening of a new mill for the Tredegar Iron and Coal Company. However, a formal organisation was not constituted until 1876. Threatened with extinction, local citizens met to pledge financial support ‚Äì a decision that has subsequently seen Tredegar Town Band proudly represent their community throughout the brass banding world for 137 years. History shows that early contesting victories were sporadic, with recently unearthed archives revealing that the band competed both locally and nationally at lower section level with occasional successes up to the start of the Second World War. Many of these came under the baton of Eli Shaw, the first of many remarkable conductors to have directed the band to victory in the past century or more. Tredegar enjoyed increasing contesting success after the Second World War, under the direction of first, Cornelius Buckley, followed later by John Childs. This resulted in the Second Section Champion Band of Great Britain title in 1973, the band's first Champion Band of Wales title in 1974 and victory at the Grand Shield in 1976. Firmly established in the top echelon of brass banding ever since, Tredegar Town Band has been Champion Band of Wales a further eight times. Welsh Regional Champion on eleven occasions, as well as securing multiple Pontins, Welsh National Eisteddfod, Welsh Open, Yeovil, BBC Radio Wales and Wychavon titles. In addition, the band was twice runners-up at the National Championships of Great Britain, in 1993, and 2003, as well as the British Open in 1996, and claimed a podium finish at the European Brass Band Championships in 1991. The latest contesting renaissance came with the appointment of Ian Porthouse as Musical Director in 2008, immediately regaining the Welsh Area title and subsequently achieving increasingly impressive domestic and national contesting results. 2010 was truly historic, with the band claiming no less than seven major domestic and national titles, culminating with the unique double feat of winning the Grand Shield and the British Open Championship in the same year. 2013 has seen the band add to this success by proudly reclaiming the British Open Championship title after producing a truly memorable performance of Stephen Roberts' ‚ÄòArabian Nights - Fantasy on Rimsky Korsakov‚Äôs Scheherazade for Brass Band‚Äô. Soprano player Ian Roberts won the Brian Evans Memorial Trophy, with Solo Euphonium Daniel Thomas claiming the Geoffrey Whitham Award. The Stanley Wainwright ‚ÄòBest Soloist‚Äô Trophy went to the band's Principal Cornet Dewi Griffiths. In the opinion of respected brass band adjudicator David Read the band's contest performance ranked close to the legendary 1985 Black Dyke National win on 'Cloudcatcher Fells'. Tredegar Orpheus Male voice choir celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2009. Originally in Tredegar there were two choirs, a glee party and a small chapel choir. In 1909, these united under the baton of Mr John Davy Evans, and thus became known as 'The Tredegar Orpheus Male Voice Choir', the name Orpheus coming from the Greek god of music. Tredegar is home to rugby union teams Tredegar Rugby Football ClubTredegar Rugby Football Club who play in the Swalec League Division Two East and Tredegar Ironsides Rugby Football Club. The club was formed in 1946. There is also the nearby Tredegar and Rhymney Golf Club. Tredegar is home to Bryn Bach Park, a country park. Home of the Blaenau Gwent film Academy which gives young people (7-18) opportunity to learn how to produce films and build up confidence, which has gone to produce both multi award-winning films Life of a Plastic Cup and Stationary Bike based on the short story by Stephen King.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-49906926 Local schools * Two dame schools prior to 1828 * The Town School opened in 1837 * Earl Street mixed Junior & Infants Schools in 1876 * Georgetown schools in 1877.

By 1805, a joint venture between the Tredegar Iron Company and the Monmouthshire Canal resulted in the early development of what became the Merthyr, Tredegar and Abergavenny Railway, connecting Tredegar to Newport Docks through of tramway. Originally powered by horses, in 1829 Chief Engineer Thomas Ellis was authorised to purchase a steam locomotive from the Stephenson Company. Built at Tredegar Works and made its maiden trip on 17 December 1829. In 1865 the railway was extended north to Nantybwch to meet the LNWR. The railway declined with the industrial works, and Tredegar railway station closed with the Beeching Axe in 1963. The closest railway stations now are in Ebbw Vale, Rhymney and Abergavenny. The proposed South Wales Metro includes a station in Tredegar, using the line closed by the Beeching Axe. For much of the 20th Century Tredegar was served by two bus companies: Red&White; Services Ltd (based Chepstow) and Hill's of Tredegar (local family-owned business). Red&White; had a large depot in the town and built a brand new Bus Station (in front of the depot building) which was opened 30 January 1959 by then local MP Aneurin Bevan. Carreg Bica Isaf In October 2013 local farmer Paul Morris was given a 10-month jail term, suspended for two years, for allowing 4,700 individual loads of waste to be illegally dumped on the land from March 2006, and making made ¬£283,000 in the process. Morris had allowed more than 87,000 tonnes of controlled waste to be dumped in a disused reservoir on his farm in Hilltop, over a four-year period. Commenting on the case, Gareth O‚ÄôShea, of Natural Resources Wales, said: \\"We hope the outcome of this case will send out a positive message to those in the waste industry, that Natural Resources Wales will not tolerate those who seek to profit by breaking the law, harming local communities or damaging the environment.\\" Filming location Tredegar has been used for numerous TV and film locations, including The District Nurse starring Nerys Hughes. In 1982, a televised version of the A.J. Cronin novel, The Citadel, was filmed in Tredegar, starring Ben Cross. The series was based partly on Cronin's experiences as a doctor in the town, where he had worked for the Tredegar Medical Aid Society in the early 1920s. This society contributed the model which established the British National Health Service.How the Medical Aid Society started..., Tredegar Development Trust, accessed 17 May 2010 Aneurin Bevan who launched the Health Service in 1948 said \\"\\"All I am doing is extending to the entire population of Britain the benefits we had in Tredegar for a generation or more. We are going to 'Tredegarise' you\\"A Labour Delivery, 60 Years of the NHS, accessed May 2010 Just north of Tredegar lies the Trefil region. Trefil found new fame in 2005 when it was used as a location for the alien Vogon homeworld in the film of Douglas Adams's book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. In 2011 the Trefil Region was once again used as a filming location for a major Hollywood production when parts of a sequel to Clash of the Titans was filmed there. On 13 May 2008 the car crash scene for short film Cow filmed on the Tredegar bypass. 'Cow' was produced by Gwent Police and Tredegar Comprehensive School to highlight the dangers of texting while driving.Gwent Police The movie was made available online and received widespread attention, featuring on TV news programs, in newspapers and internet forums worldwide. On 25 January 2010 the independent movie A Bit of Tom Jones? premiered at Leicester Square, London.

Appeals from the Western District of North Carolina are taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).

History  The United States District Court for the District of North Carolina was established on June 4, 1790, by .Asbury Dickens, A Synoptical Index to the Laws and Treaties of the United States of America (1852), p. 389.U.S. District Courts of North Carolina, Legislative history, Federal Judicial Center. On June 9, 1794, it was subdivided into three districts by , but on March 3, 1797, the three districts were abolished and the single District restored by , until April 29, 1802, when the state was again subdivided into three different districts by . In both instances, these districts, unlike those with geographic designations that existed in other states, were titled by the names of the cities in which the courts sat. After the first division, they were styled the District of Edenton, the District of New Bern, and the District of Wilmington; after the second division, they were styled the District of Albemarle, the District of Cape Fear, and the District of Pamptico. However, in both instances, only one judge was authorized to serve all three districts, causing them to effectively operate as a single district. The latter combination was occasionally referred to by the cumbersome title of the United States District Court for the Albemarle, Cape Fear & Pamptico Districts of North Carolina. On June 4, 1872, North Carolina was re-divided into two Districts, Eastern and Western, by . The presiding judge of the District of North Carolina, George Washington Brooks, was then reassigned to preside over only the Eastern District, allowing President Ulysses S. Grant to appoint Robert P. Dick to be the first judge of the Western District of North Carolina.

The earliest viola sonatas are difficult to date for a number of reasons: *in the Baroque era, there were many works written for the viola da gamba, including sonatas (the most famous being Johann Sebastian Bach's three, now most often played on the cello) *in the Classical era and early Romantic, there were few works written with viola specifically in mind as solo instrument, and many of these, like those of the Stamitz family, may have been written for the viola d'amore, like most of their viola works‚Äîthough it is now customary to play them on the viola; it was more typical to publish a work or set, like George Onslow's opus 16 cello sonatas, or Johannes Brahms's opus 120 clarinet sonatas in the late 19th century, that specified the viola as an alternate. Two early exceptions were the viola sonatas of Felix Mendelssohn (1824, posthumously published around 1981) and the opus 1 sonata of the composer Ernst Naumann (1832‚Äì1910), published in 1854. * The viola returned to a solo role in the 20th century. Max Reger wrote three sonatas for either clarinet or viola at the beginning of the century. Paul Hindemith, himself a viola virtuoso, composed works several sonatas for viola solo, and others for viola and piano such as the Sonata for Viola and Piano, Op. 11 No. 4 in 1919. Rebecca Clarke composed the Sonata for viola and piano the same year. Bax's Viola Sonata, written (like Walton's concerto) for the great English viola player Lionel Tertis in 1923, is one of his most-played and oft-recorded chamber works. Mieczys≈Çaw Weinberg wrote four viola sonatas between 1971 and 1983. The Sonata for Viola and Piano, Op. 147, is the last composition by Dmitri Shostakovich, completed in July 1975 and dedicated to Fyodor Druzhinin.Donald Maurice, \\"Schostakovich's Swansong,\\" Journal of the American Viola Society 16, no. 1 (2000): 13.

He is perhaps the most influential living acoustic guitar player in bluegrass, progressive bluegrass, newgrass and flattop acoustic jazz. He was inducted into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame in 2013. Rice's music spans the range of acoustic from traditional bluegrass to jazz- influenced New Acoustic music to songwriter-oriented folk. Over the course of his career, he has played alongside J. D. Crowe and the New South, David Grisman (during the formation of \\"Dawg Music\\") and Jerry Garcia, led his own Tony Rice Unit, collaborated with Norman Blake, recorded with his brothers Wyatt, Ron, and Larry, and co-founded the Bluegrass Album Band. He has recorded with drums, piano, soprano sax, as well as with traditional bluegrass instrumentation. Early years Rice was born in Danville, Virginia but grew up in Los Angeles, California, where his father, Herb Rice, introduced him to bluegrass. Tony and his brothers learned the fundamentals of bluegrass and country music from L.A. musicians like the Kentucky Colonels, led by Roland and Clarence White. Clarence White in particular became a huge influence on Rice. Crossing paths with fellow enthusiasts like Ry Cooder, Herb Pedersen and Chris Hillman reinforced the strength of the music he had learned from his father. Groups RockyGrass 2005 In 1970, Rice had moved to Louisville, Kentucky where he played with the Bluegrass Alliance, and shortly thereafter, J.D. Crowe's New South. The New South was known as one of the best and most progressive bluegrass groups‚Äîeventually adding drums and electric instruments (to Rice's displeasure). When Ricky Skaggs joined them in 1974, however, the band recorded J. D. Crowe & the New South, an acoustic album that became Rounder Records' top-seller up to that time. At this point, the group consisted of Rice on guitar and lead vocals, Crowe on banjo and vocals, Jerry Douglas on Dobro, Skaggs on fiddle, mandolin, and tenor vocals, and Bobby Slone on bass and fiddle. Around this time, Rice met mandolinist David Grisman, who played with Red Allen during the 1960s and was now working on original material that blended jazz, bluegrass, and classical styles. Rice left the New South and moved to California to join Grisman's all-instrumental group. As part of the David Grisman Quintet, in order to broaden his expertise and make himself more marketable, Rice began studying chord theory, learned to read charts, and began to expand his playing beyond bluegrass. Renowned guitarist John Carlini came in to teach Rice music theory, and Carlini helped him learn the intricacies of jazz playing and musical improvisation, in general. The David Grisman Quintet's 1977 debut recording is considered a landmark of acoustic string band music. In 1980, Rice, Crowe, Bobby Hicks, Doyle Lawson and Todd Phillips formed the Bluegrass Album Band and recorded from 1980 to 1996. With the Tony Rice Unit, he pursued experimental \\"spacegrass\\" music on Mar West, Still Inside, and Backwaters. Members of the Unit included Jimmy Gaudreau (mandolin), Wyatt Rice (guitar), Ronnie Simpkins (bass), and Rickie Simpkins (fiddle). In the late 1980s Alison Krauss played regularly with the group in concert for about a year but never appeared on the albums. Alison Brown also guested with the group during that period.Tony Rice, remarks from the stage, unreleased recording of Tony Rice Unit with Alison Krauss, live in Santa Cruz, California, 1989 Collaborations In 1980, he recorded an album of bluegrass duets with Ricky Skaggs, called Skaggs & Rice. Two albums with traditional instrumentalist and songwriter Norman Blake garnered acclaim, as well as two Rice Brothers albums (1992 and 1994) that featured him teamed with his late elder brother, Larry, and younger brothers, Wyatt and Ronnie. Beginning in 1984, Rice collaborated on four albums by B√©la Fleck - Double Time (B√©la Fleck album) (1984), Drive (B√©la Fleck album) (1988), Tales from the Acoustic Planet (1995), and The Bluegrass Sessions: Tales from the Acoustic Planet, Vol. 2 (1999). He joined David Grisman and Jerry Garcia in 1993 to record The Pizza Tapes. In 1994 Rice and Grisman recorded Tone Poems, an original collection of material, where they used historical vintage mandolins and guitars, different for each track. In 1994, Rice joined Mark Johnson to record \\"Clawgrass Mark Johnson with the Rice Brothers and Friends\\" which featured Tony as well as his late brother Larry Rice and his other brothers Wyatt and Ronnie. In 1995, Rice recorded a duo album with John Carlini, who also played with the David Grisman Quintet. In 1997, Rice, his brother Larry, Chris Hillman (formerly of the Flying Burrito Brothers and the Byrds) and banjoist Herb Pedersen, founded the so-called \\"anti-supergroup\\" Rice, Rice, Hillman & Pedersen and produced three volumes of music between 1997 and 2001. In the 2000s and 2010s, He performed as a quartet with guitarist/singer-songwriter Peter Rowan, bassist Bryn Bright (later known as Bryn Davies, and mandolinist Billy Bright (replaced by Sharon Gilchrist. Solo career In 1979, Rice left Grisman's group to record Acoustics, a jazz-inspired album, and then Manzanita, a bluegrass and folk album. A similar combination was evident on Cold on the Shoulder, Native American, and Me & My Guitar, albums which combined bluegrass, jazzy guitar work, and the songwriting of Ian Tyson, Joni Mitchell, Phil Ochs, Tom Paxton, Bob Dylan, and Gordon Lightfoot. Rice's singing voice was a distinctive baritone. In 1994 he was diagnosed with a disorder known as muscle tension dysphonia and as a result was forced to stop singing in live performance. A 2014 diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis (\\"tennis elbow\\") made guitar playing painful and Rice's last performance playing guitar live was his induction into the International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame in 2013. In 2015, Rice was quoted as saying \\"I am not going to go back out into the public eye until I can be the musician that I was, where I left off or better. I have been blessed with a very devout audience all these years, and I am certainly not going to let anybody down.

The band was formed in 1994 and consisted of lead vocalist, guitarist and lyricist Lauren Laverne (b. Lauren Gofton), drummer Johnny X (real name Pete Gofton, Lauren's brother), lead guitarist and occasional lead vocalist Marie du Santiago (b. Anne Marie Nixon) and bass guitarist Emmy-Kate Montrose (b. Emma Jackson). The band's name comes from their favourite character in the 1970s film Grease. History By the time Catsuit City (1995) was released on Slampt, Kenickie declined an offer by Alan McGee to sign to Creation. The band opened the bill for the Ramones final UK appearance at the Brixton Academy on 3 February 1996. Following the release of Skillex (1996) on Fierce Panda, Kenickie signed to Saint Etienne's EMI subsidiary, EMIDisc. Kenickie registered in the UK Singles Chart, their highest position being No. 24 with the single \\"In Your Car\\", which opened Top of the Pops on the 10 January 1997 edition. Their debut album At The Club, peaked at No. 9 in the UK Albums Chart in May 1997. Kenickie also contributed a song to the Gary Numan tribute album Random, released in June that year. That summer, they were scheduled to play Glastonbury; their set was postponed, due to rain, but took place later on the scheduled day. After meeting them in New York, Courtney Love said: > They're a big bunch of sex, that band Kenickie. They're a big, raw-boned > bunch of fucking sex ‚Äî all three of them and the boy. I hope they get good. > I hope we're a good example to them, I hope this record's huge and then the > big labels will start sniffing around and then those big fucking raw-boned > sexy Newcastle (sic) girls will be huge and have Number Ones and there will > be an Amazon planet the way I want it. The band's second album, Get In appeared in 1998. It was well-received in the music press (NME generally praised the album\\"Make It Hot\\" - review of Get In by Kenickie, NME 1998 while Melody Maker rated it 8/10), but sold less well. Johnny X, who now referred to himself as Pete X, moved to guitar, with the live band augmented by Graham Christie (later of Data Panik) on drums and Dot Allen on keyboards. Kenickie disbanded on 15 October 1998 after a London Astoria gig, where Lauren closed the night by saying \\"We were Kenickie ... a bunch of fuckwits\\". After Kenickie Lauren Laverne released one solo EP, and sang on the 2000 Mint Royale single, \\"Don't Falter\\", which reached No. 15 in the UK chart. Laverne also was an uncredited vocalist on The Divine Comedy's 2004 single \\"Come Home Billy Bird\\" which reached No. 25 in the same chart. Since then she has presented various radio shows on radio station Xfm, most notably the breakfast show, before quitting in April 2007. She has also moved into television, originally as a guest on early episodes of music quiz Never Mind the Buzzcocks. She earned her own weekly spot on Channel 4 music show Planet Pop and became presenter, with Myleene Klass, of ITV music programme cd:uk in 2005, and hosted Channel 4's music show Transmission with Steve Jones in 2006 and 2007. She is currently lead host of BBC 2's The Culture Show and has her own daily radio show on BBC 6 Music, as well as occasionally deputising for holidaying presenters on BBC Radio 2. She co- hosted Channel 4 show, 10 O'Clock Live, with David Mitchell, Jimmy Carr and Charlie Brooker. In 2018, she became the host of BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. Du Santiago and Montrose went on to form a new band called Rosita, and released two singles before splitting up. Du Santiago - as Marie Nixon \\\\- is now a member of The Cornshed Sisters and former head of communications for the Northern region of the Arts Council. In Autumn 2012, she took up position as Chief Executive of the University of Sunderland Students' Union. Montrose completed a PhD in sociology in 2010 at Goldsmiths University. After some time as a research fellow in Urban Studies at the University of Glasgow, she returned to Goldsmiths in January 2015 as a lecturer in the Department of Sociology Johnny X went on to record under the name J Xaverre. He toured with Peter Brewis of Field Music's new project 'The Week That Was' and later played in Frankie & The Heartstrings. The band's one-time touring keyboard player Tony O'Neill (known in the band as Elvis Wesley) is now an author, living in the United States. Legacy Kenickie have been credited as having inspired a wave of mainstream female guitar bands that emerged in the wake of their split, including 21st Century Girls, Hepburn and Thunderbugs. At around the same time they also were a cited influence on a generation of female alternative bands, such as Chicks, Angelica, Cheetara (who covered Come Out 2Nite) and Vyvyan, many of them associated with the Club Rampage \\"Bratpop\\" scene.Teenage Rampage (Bratpop special cover feature), Melody Maker, 15 August 1998, pp. 20‚Äì22 Discography =Studio albums= *At the Club (1997) *Get In (1998) References External links * BBC radio1/johnpeel kenickie page * Kenickie Corner * Planet Kenickie * Kenickie Fried Chicken Category:English indie rock groups Category:British indie pop groups Category:English pop punk groups Category:Britpop groups Category:Musical groups from Sunderland Category:Fierce Panda Records artists Category:Warner Records artists ","title":"Kenickie"},{"id":"1137988","text":"Richard Sandoval (born 18 October 1960) is a retired American professional boxer and former Lineal and WBA Bantamweight Champion. Sandoval was a silver medalist at the 1979 Pan American Games in Puerto Rico and was a U.S. Olympian during his amateur career. He's also the younger brother of title contender Alberto Sandoval. Early life He was born in Pomona, California, a city famous in pugilistic circles as a hot-bed for young boxing prospects, including Shane Mosley. Sandoval's brother Alberto Sandoval was a popular bantamweight of the 1970s, who unsuccessfully challenged Carlos Zarate and Lupe Pintor for the world title. The young Sandoval met another future world champion, Alberto Davila, at Pomona boxing gyms. Eventually, they became friends, and they shared the burden of boxing's dangers later on in life. Amateur career He was a two-time National Golden Gloves Champion and from 1979‚Äì1980, Sandoval went on to win the National AAU Championship at Light Flyweight and then in the Flyweight division. Sanadoval qualified for the 1980 U.S. Olympic team but was unable to compete due to the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott. In 2007, he received one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the spurned athletes. Professional career Richie Sandoval made his professional boxing debut on 5 November 1980, beating Gerardo Pedroza in Las Vegas, Nevada by a knockout in two rounds. He won his first ten fights by knockout, including two over fringe contender Javier Barajas. For his eleventh fight, Sandoval met Harold Petty, a boxer still fighting professionally at the age of 42 who challenged twice for world titles. On 28 January 1982, he outpointed the undefeated Petty over ten rounds, going on to seven more wins that year, including another ten-round points victory over Petty. Sandoval had five wins in 1983, the year in which his friend Davila won the WBC Bantamweight title by knocking out Kiko Bejines, who died days later. This introduced Sandoval to the darker side of boxing as he saw how hard it was for Davila to recover. =WBA Bantamweight Championship= Sandoval's next fight was held on 15 March 1984. Despite his record of 22 victories without any losses, including fifteen knockouts, he was a virtual unknown to most boxing fans when he met the Lineal and WBA Bantamweight champion Jeff Chandler in Atlantic City. After dropping the champion in round eleven, Sandoval won by TKO in round fifteen to become a world champion in a major upset.http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Jeff_Chandler_vs._Richie_Sandovalhttps://twitter.com/BoxingHistory/status/982724397323595776 He followed this up with his first trip abroad as a professional boxer, to Monte Carlo on September 22. He outpointed the top ranked and well known Edgar Rom√°n over fifteen rounds on the undercard of Donald Curry's sixth-round knockout win over Nino LaRocca. He fought again on 15 December against Cardenio Ulloa, who was attempting to become the first Chilean world boxing champion in history. According to the report made by Ring En Espa√±ol, Ulloa caused Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to jump off his chair with excitement when he dropped Sandoval in the third round, but Sandoval recovered and retained the title with an eighth-round knockout. By then, however, Sandoval was facing weight problems and he could barely make the weight even for fights in the Featherweight division, two divisions above Bantamweight, and he was forced to fight all his fights in 1985 as a Featherweight instead. He scored three ten-round decisions that year and one in 1986, including wins over Frankie Duarte and Diego Avila. Last bout and title defence After not defending his title for a year and a half, he was forced by the WBA to defend his title or be stripped of it. He chose to defend it, despite his problems making the weight. On 3 March 1986, Sandoval defended his title against Gaby Canizales, as part of a super-undercard organized by promoter Bob Arum, which included the Hearns versus Shuler and Hagler versus Mugabi encounters. Sandoval reportedly had to lose around twelve pounds in three days in order to be able to fight that night, staying off any solid foods and surviving only on water. Weakened and feeling the side-effects of such a sudden drop-off in weight, Sandoval suffered four knockdowns, but he fought on until the fifth knockdown, which happened in round seven, after which the referee stopped the fight. He fell unconscious a few minutes after the fight, stopping breathing for an estimated three minutes. He was rushed to hospital by local on-site paramedics, but he remained in critical condition for the next few nights. He had life-saving brain surgery, but the inevitable consequence was that Sandoval was obliged to retire. His final record was 29 wins and one loss, 17 wins by knockout. =Retirement= Sandoval later went touring across the United States with Davila, as each had been through both sides of a tragic boxing bout. They went on television talk-shows and public appearances to explain to the general public how a boxer feels (in Davila's case) after an opponent has died, and how a boxer can be so close to death in an instant after a fight (in Sandoval's case), and then having to deal with the fact that he or she will never be able to box again. Sandoval and Davila remain friends.

Right field is the area of the outfield to the right of a person standing at home plate and facing towards the pitcher's mound. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the right fielder is assigned the number 9.  Position description  Right fielder Giancarlo Stanton of the New York Yankees, seen here during his tenure with the Miami Marlins, signed the richest contract in sports history in 2014. Outfielders must cover large distances, so speed, instincts and quickness to react to the ball are key. They must be able to catch fly balls above their head and on the run, as well as prevent balls hit down the right field foul line from getting past them. Being situated 250‚Äì300 feet from home plate, they must be able to throw the ball accurately over a long distance to be effective. Of all outfield positions, the right fielder often has the strongest arm, because they are the farthest from third base. As well as the requirements above, the right fielder backs up first base on all throws from the catcher and pitcher, when possible, and all bunted balls, since the catcher or the first baseman must be available for fielding the ball. The right fielder backs up second base on any ball thrown from the left side of the field, i.e. shortstop, third base, or foul line territory. The right fielder backs up first base when the first baseman is in a run down between 3rd base and home. The right fielder tends to be a stronger offensive player than defensive, as right-handed batters, which are more common than left-handed ones, tend to pull the ball to left field, especially in Little League. In addition, unlike at the professional level, where hitters have the ability to drive the ball into the outfield in all directions, most Little League batters are unable to hit the ball out of the infield with any regularity. For these reasons, right field has developed a reputation in Little League as being a position where less talented players can be \\"hidden\\" without damaging a team's defense in any significant way.

Today, the Salinan governments are now working toward federal tribal recognition from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Map of Salinan placenames, dialects, and tribelets There were two major divisions, the Miguelino in the south, on the upper course of the Salinas River (which flows south to north), and the Antoniano in the north, in the lower part of the Salinas Basin, corresponding to the two missions in the Salinas Valley (Mission San Antonio de Padua and Mission San Miguel Arc√°ngel). There were also a Playano group on the Pacific Coast in the vicinity of what is now San Simeon and Lucia. Before European contact, Salinans lived by hunting and gathering and, like most other California tribes, were organized in small groups with little centralized political structure. Etymology The Salinan people were named after the Salinas River by Robert Latham (needs documentation)(1856) and John Powell (1891). The people's own name for themselves is the \\"Te'po'ta'ahl\\" or \\"People of the Oaks,\\" according to current tribal leadership. C. Hart Merriam called these people the En-'ne-sen on advice from one informant; En-'ne-sen was the native word for the Salinan headquarters.Hester, p.504 Language The Salinan language, spoken until the 1950s is a language isolate. It may be a part of the Hokan language family. Sapir included it in a subfamily of Hokan, along with Chumash and Seri; this classification has found its way into more recent encyclopedias and presentations of language families, but serious supporting evidence has never been presented.Marlett 2008 Population Estimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. Alfred L. Kroeber put the 1770 population of the Salinan as 3,000.Kroeber, p.883 Sherburne F. Cook similarly estimated that there were at least 700 Salinans.Cook, p.187 The 2000 United States Census reported a total population of Salinan 681.

It was a large, carnivorous animal that lived in what is today China and Mongolia. Sarkastodon is known only from a skull and jawbones. Sarkastodon, like creodonts in general, was probably a hypercarnivore that preyed on large mammals in its range during the Late Eocene, such as brontotheres, chalicotheres, and rhinoceroses.

It is often a freelance profession. Screenwriters are responsible for researching the story, developing the narrative, writing the script, screenplay, dialogues and delivering it, in the required format, to development executives. Screenwriters therefore have great influence over the creative direction and emotional impact of the screenplay and, arguably, of the finished film. Screenwriters either pitch original ideas to producers, in the hope that they will be optioned or sold; or are commissioned by a producer to create a screenplay from a concept, true story, existing screen work or literary work, such as a novel, poem, play, comic book, or short story. Types The act of screenwriting takes many forms across the entertainment industry. Often, multiple writers work on the same script at different stages of development with different tasks. Over the course of a successful career, a screenwriter might be hired to write in a wide variety of roles. Some of the most common forms of screenwriting jobs include: =Spec script writing= Spec scripts are feature film or television show scripts written on speculation of sale, without the commission of a film studio, production company or TV network. The content is usually invented solely by the screenwriter, though spec screenplays can also be based on established works or real people and events. The spec script is a Hollywood sales tool. The vast majority of scripts written each year are spec scripts, but only a small percentage make it to the screen.The Great American Screenplay now fuels wannabe authors from seattlepi.nwsource.com A spec script is usually a wholly original work, but can also be an adaptation. In television writing, a spec script is a sample teleplay written to demonstrate the writer's knowledge of a show and ability to imitate its style and conventions. It is submitted to the show's producers in hopes of being hired to write future episodes of the show. Budding screenwriters attempting to break into the business generally begin by writing one or more spec scripts. Although writing spec scripts is part of any writer's career, the Writers Guild of America forbids members to write \\"on speculation\\". The distinction is that a \\"spec script\\" is written as a sample by the writer on his or her own; what is forbidden is writing a script for a specific producer without a contract. In addition to writing a script on speculation, it is generally not advised to write camera angles or other directional terminology, as these are likely to be ignored. A director may write up a shooting script himself or herself, a script that guides the team in what to do in order to carry out the director's vision of how the script should look. The director may ask the original writer to co-write it with him or her, or to rewrite a script that satisfies both the director and producer of the film/TV show. Spec writing is also unique in that the writer must pitch the idea to producers. In order to sell the script, it must have an excellent title, good writing, and a great logline. A logline is one sentence that lays out what the movie is about. A well written logline will convey the tone of the film, introduce the main character, and touch on the primary conflict. Usually the logline and title work in tandem to draw people in, and it is highly suggested to incorporate irony into them when possible. These things, along with nice, clean writing will hugely impact whether or not a producer picks up the spec script. = Commissioned screenplay = A commissioned screenplay is written by a hired writer. The concept is usually developed long before the screenwriter is brought on, and often has multiple writers work on it before the script is given a green light. The plot development is usually based on highly successful novels, plays, TV shows and even video games, and the rights to which have been legally acquired. =Feature assignment writing= Scripts written on assignment are screenplays created under contract with a studio, production company, or producer. These are the most common assignments sought after in screenwriting. A screenwriter can get an assignment either exclusively or from \\"open\\" assignments. A screenwriter can also be approached and offered an assignment. Assignment scripts are generally adaptations of an existing idea or property owned by the hiring company,Lydia Willen and Joan Willen, How to Sell your Screenplay, pg 242. Square One Publishers, 2001. but can also be original works based on a concept created by the writer or producer. =Rewriting and script doctoring= Most produced films are rewritten to some extent during the development process. Frequently, they are not rewritten by the original writer of the script.Skip Press, The Ultimate Writer's Guide to Hollywood, pg xiii. Barnes and Noble Books, 2004. Many established screenwriters, as well as new writers whose work shows promise but lacks marketability, make their living rewriting scripts. When a script's central premise or characters are good but the script is otherwise unusable, a different writer or team of writers is contracted to do an entirely new draft, often referred to as a \\"page one rewrite\\". When only small problems remain, such as bad dialogue or poor humor, a writer is hired to do a \\"polish\\" or \\"punch-up\\". Depending on the size of the new writer's contributions, screen credit may or may not be given. For instance, in the American film industry, credit to rewriters is given only if 50% or more of the script is substantially changed.credits policy from wga.org These standards can make it difficult to establish the identity and number of screenwriters who contributed to a film's creation. When established writers are called in to rewrite portions of a script late in the development process, they are commonly referred to as script doctors. Prominent script doctors include Christopher Keane, Steve Zaillian, William Goldman, Robert Towne, Mort Nathan, Quentin Tarantino and Peter Russell.Virginia Wright Wetman. \\"Success Has 1,000 Fathers (So Do Films)\\". The New York Times. May 28, 1995. Arts section, p.16. Many up-and-coming screenwriters work as ghost writers. =Television writing= A freelance television writer typically uses spec scripts or previous credits and reputation to obtain a contract to write one or more episodes for an existing television show. After an episode is submitted, rewriting or polishing may be required. A staff writer for a TV show generally works in-house, writing and rewriting episodes. Staff writers-- often given other titles, such as story editor or producer--work both as a group and individually on episode scripts to maintain the show's tone, style, characters, and plots.TV Writer.com from tvwriter.com Television show creators write the television pilot and bible of new television series. They are responsible for creating and managing all aspects of a show's characters, style, and plots. Frequently, a creator remains responsible for the show's day-to-day creative decisions throughout the series run as showrunner, head writer or story editor. Writing for daily series The process of writing for soap operas and telenovelas is different from that used by prime time shows, due in part to the need to produce new episodes five days a week for several months. In one example cited by Jane Espenson, screenwriting is a \\"sort of three-tiered system\\":08/13/2008: Soapy Scenes, from \\"Jane in Progress\\" a blog for aspiring screenwriters by Jane Espenson :a few top writers craft the overall story arcs. Mid-level writers work with them to turn those arcs into things that look a lot like traditional episode outlines, and an array of writers below that (who do not even have to be local to Los Angeles), take those outlines and quickly generate the dialogue while adhering slavishly to the outlines. Espenson notes that a recent trend has been to eliminate the role of the mid-level writer, relying on the senior writers to do rough outlines and giving the other writers a bit more freedom. Regardless, when the finished scripts are sent to the top writers, the latter do a final round of rewrites. Espenson also notes that a show that airs daily, with characters who have decades of history behind their voices, necessitates a writing staff without the distinctive voice that can sometimes be present in prime-time series. Writing for game shows Game shows feature live contestants, but still use a team of writers as part of a specific format.05/15/2010: Writers Guild of America, Reality & Game Show Writers This may involve the slate of questions and even specific phrasing or dialogue on the part of the host. Writers may not script the dialogue used by the contestants, but they work with the producers to create the actions, scenarios, and sequence of events that support the game show's concept. =Video game writing= With the continued development and increased complexity of video games, many opportunities are available to employ screenwriters in the field of video game design. Video game writers work closely with the other game designers to create characters, scenarios, and dialogue.Skip Press, The Ultimate Writer's Guide to Hollywood, pg207. Barnes and Noble Books, 2004. Theories on writing a screenplay Fundamentally, the screenplay is a unique literary form. It is like a musical score, in that it is intended to be interpreted on the basis of other artists' performance, rather than serving as a finished product for the enjoyment of its audience. For this reason, a screenplay is written using technical jargon and tight, spare prose when describing stage directions. Unlike a novel or short story, a screenplay focuses on describing the literal, visual aspects of the story, rather than on the internal thoughts of its characters. In screenwriting, the aim is to evoke those thoughts and emotions through subtext, action, and symbolism.Trottier, David: \\"The Screenwriter's Bible\\", pg4. Silman James, 1998. Several main screenwriting theories help writers approach the screenplay by systematizing the structure, goals and techniques of writing a script. The most common kinds of theories are structural. Screenwriter William Goldman is widely quoted as saying \\"Screenplays are structure\\". =Three-act structure= The three acts are: the setup (of the location and characters), the confrontation (with an obstacle), and the resolution (culminating in a climax and a d√©nouement). Usually, in a two-hour film, the first and third acts both typically last around 30 minutes, with the middle act lasting roughly an hour, but today many films start from the confrontation point and then goes to the setup act or they might even start at the last act and then go back to the start. In Writing Drama, French writer and director Yves Lavandier shows a slightly different approach.Excerpt on the three-act structure from Yves Lavandier's Writing Drama As do most theorists, he maintains that every human action, whether fictitious or real, contains three logical parts: before the action, during the action, and after the action. But since the climax is part of the action, Yves Lavandier maintains that the second act must include the climax, which makes for a much shorter third act than is found in most screenwriting theories. Besides the three-act structure, it is also common to use a four- or five-act structure in a screenplay, though certain screenplays may include as many as twenty separate acts. = The Hero's Journey = The hero's journey, also referred to as the monomyth, is an idea formulated by noted mythologist Joseph Campbell. The central concept of the monomyth is that a pattern can be seen in stories and myths across history. Campbell defined and explained that pattern in his book The Hero with a Thousand Faces (1949). Campbell's insight was that important myths from around the world, which have survived for thousands of years, all share a fundamental structure. This fundamental structure contains a number of stages, which include #a call to adventure, which the hero has to accept or decline, #a road of trials, on which the hero succeeds or fails, #achieving the goal (or \\"boon\\"), which often results in important self-knowledge, #a return to the ordinary world, which again the hero can succeed or fail, and #application of the boon, in which what the hero has gained can be used to improve the world. Later, screenwriter Christopher Vogler refined and expanded the hero's journey for the screenplay form in his book, The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers (1993). = Syd Field's Paradigm = In his book Screenplay Syd Field posited a new theory, which he called the Paradigm. Field noticed that in a 120-page screenplay, Act Two was notoriously boring, and was also twice the length of Acts One and Three. He also noticed that an important dramatic event usually occurred at the middle of the picture, which implied to him that the middle act was actually two acts in one. So the Three Act Structure is notated 1, 2a, 2b, 3, resulting in Aristotle's Three Acts divided into four pieces. Field also introduced the idea of Plot Points into screenwriting theory. Plot Points are important structural functions that happen in approximately the same place in most successful movies, like the verses and choruses in a popular song. In subsequent books, Field has added to his original list, and students of his like Viki King and Linda Seger have added to the list of Plot Points. Here is a current list of the major Plot Points that are congruent with Field's Paradigm: Opening Image: The first image in the screenplay should summarize the entire film, especially its tone. Often, writers go back and redo this as the last thing before submitting the script. Exposition: Provides some background information to the audience about the plot, characters' histories, setting, and theme. Inciting Incident: Also called the catalyst, this is the point in the story when the Protagonist encounters the problem that will change their life. This is when the detective is assigned the case, where Boy meets Girl, and where the Comic Hero gets fired from his cushy job, forcing him into comic circumstances. Plot Point 1: The last scene in Act One, Plot Point 1 is a surprising development that radically changes the Protagonist's life, and forces him to confront the Opponent. In Star Wars, this is when Luke's family is killed by the Empire. He has no home to go back to, so he joins the Rebels in opposing Darth Vader. Pinch 1: A reminder scene at about 3/8 the way through the script (halfway through Act 2a) that brings up the central conflict of the drama, reminding us of the overall conflict. For example, in Star Wars, Pinch 1 is the Stormtroopers attacking the Millennium Falcon in Mos Eisley, reminding us the Empire is after the stolen plans to the Death Star R2-D2 is carrying and Luke and Ben Kenobi are trying to get to the Rebel Alliance (the main conflict). Midpoint: An important scene in the middle of the script, often a reversal of fortune or revelation that changes the direction of the story. Field suggests that driving the story towards the Midpoint keeps the second act from sagging. Pinch 2: Another reminder scene about 5/8 through the script (halfway through Act 2b) that is somehow linked to Pinch 1 in reminding the audience about the central conflict. In Star Wars, Pinch 2 is the Stormtroopers attacking them as they rescue the Princess in the Death Star. Both scenes remind us of the Empire's opposition, and using the Stormtrooper attack motif unifies both Pinches. Plot Point 2: A dramatic reversal that ends Act 2 and begins Act 3, which is about confrontation and resolution. Sometimes Plot Point 2 is the moment when the Hero has had enough and is finally going to face the Opponent. Sometimes, like in Toy Story, it's the low-point for the Hero, and he must bounce back to overcome the odds in Act 3. Showdown: About midway through Act 3, the Protagonist will confront the Main Problem of the story and either overcome it, or come to a tragic end. Resolution: The issues of the story are resolved. Tag: An epilogue, tying up the loose ends of the story, giving the audience closure. This is also known as denouement. In general, films in recent decades have had longer denouements than films made in the 1970s or earlier. =The sequence approach= The sequence approach to screenwriting, sometimes known as \\"eight-sequence structure\\", is a system developed by Frank Daniel, while he was the head of the Graduate Screenwriting Program at USC. It is based in part on the fact that, in the early days of cinema, technical matters forced screenwriters to divide their stories into sequences, each the length of a reel (about ten minutes).Gulino, Paul Joseph: \\"Screenwriting: The Sequence Approach\\", pg3. Continuum, 2003. The sequence approach mimics that early style. The story is broken up into eight 10-15 minute sequences. The sequences serve as \\"mini- movies\\", each with their own compressed three-act structure. The first two sequences combine to form the film's first act. The next four create the film's second act. The final two sequences complete the resolution and d√©nouement of the story. Each sequence's resolution creates the situation which sets up the next sequence.  Screenplay Format  Most modern screenplays, at least in Hollywood and related screen cultures, are written in a style known as the Master Scene Format or Master Scene Script. The format is characterized by six elements, presented in the order in which they are most likely to be used in a script: # Scene Heading, or Slug # Action Lines, or Big Print # Character Name # Parentheticals # Dialogue # Transitions Scripts written in Master Scene Format are divided into scenes: \\"a unit of story that takes place at a specific location and time\\". Scene headings (or slugs) indicate the location the following scene is to take place in, whether it is interior or exterior, and the time-of-day it appears to be. Conventionally, they are capitalized, and may be underlined or bolded. In production drafts, scene headings are numbered. Next are action lines, which describe stage direction and are generally written in the present tense with a focus only on what can be seen or heard by the audience. Character names are in all caps, centered in the middle of the page, and indicate that a character is speaking the following dialogue. Characters who are speaking off-screen or in voice- over are indicated by the suffix (O.S.) and (V.O) respectively. Parentheticals provide stage direction for the dialogue that follows. Most often this is to indicate how dialogue should be performed (for example, angry) but can also include small stage directions (for example, picking up vase). Overuse of parentheticals is discouraged. Dialogue blocks are offset from the page's margin by 3.7\\" and are left-justified. Dialogue spoken by two characters at the same time is written side by side and is conventionally known as dual- dialogue. The final element is the scene transition and is used to indicate how the current scene should transition into the next. It is generally assumed that the transition will be a cut, and using \\"CUT TO:\\" will be redundant. Thus the element should be used sparingly to indicate a different kind of transition such as \\"DISSOLVE TO:\\". Screenwriting applications such as Final Draft (software), Celtx, Fade In (software), Slugline, Scrivener (software), and Highland, allow writers to easily format their script to adhere to the requirements of the master screen format. Dialogue and description =Imagery= Imagery can be used in many metaphoric ways. In The Talented Mr. Ripley, the title character talked of wanting to close the door on himself sometime, and then, in the end, he did. Pathetic fallacy is also frequently used; rain to express a character feeling depressed, sunny days promote a feeling of happiness and calm. Imagery can be used to sway the emotions of the audience and to clue them in to what is happening. Imagery is well defined in City of God. The opening image sequence sets the tone for the entire film. The film opens with the shimmer of a knife's blade on a sharpening stone. A drink is being prepared, The knife's blade shows again, juxtaposed is a shot of a chicken letting loose of its harness on its feet. All symbolising 'The One that got away'. The film is about life in the favelas in Rio - sprinkled with violence and games and ambition. =Dialogue= Since the advent of sound film, or \\"talkies\\", dialogue has taken a central place in much of mainstream cinema. In the cinematic arts, the audience understands the story only through what they see and hear: action, music, sound effects, and dialogue. For many screenwriters, the only way their audiences can hear the writer's words is through the characters' dialogue. This has led writers such as Diablo Cody, Joss Whedon, and Quentin Tarantino to become well known for their dialogue‚Äînot just their stories. Bollywood and other Indian film industries use separate dialogue writers in addition to the screenplay writers. =Plot= Plot, according to Aristotle's Poetics, refers to the sequence events connected by cause and effect in a story. A story is a series of events conveyed in chronological order. A plot is the same series of events deliberately arranged to maximize the story's dramatic, thematic, and emotional significance. E.M.Forster famously gives the example \\"The king died and then the queen died\\" is a story.\\" But \\"The king died and then the queen died of grief\\" is a plot. For Trey Parker and Matt Stone this is best summarized as a series of events connected by \\"therefore\\" and \\"but\\". Screenwriting education A number of American universities offer specialized Master of Fine Arts and undergraduate programs in screenwriting, including USC, DePaul University, American Film Institute, Loyola Marymount University, Chapman University, NYU, UCLA, Boston University and the University of the Arts. In Europe, the United Kingdom has an extensive range of MA and BA Screenwriting Courses including London College of Communication, Bournemouth University, Edinburgh University, and Goldsmiths College (University of London). Some schools offer non-degree screenwriting programs, such as the TheFilmSchool, The International Film and Television School Fast Track, and the UCLA Professional / Extension Programs in Screenwriting. New York Film Academy offers both degree and non-degree educational systems with campuses all around the world. Many screenwriters choose to pursue screenwriting independently with free online educational resources such as ScreenCraft, Keanewords, NoFilmSchool, the Draft Zero podcast, the Paper Team podcast, Write Along podcast, Film Daily, The Black List, John August and Craig Mazin's Scriptnotes podcast, and Julie Gray's Just Effing Entertain Me.  History  The first true screenplay is thought to be from George Melies' 1902 film A Trip to the Moon. The movie is silent, but the screenplay still contains specific descriptions and action lines that resemble a modern-day script. As time went on and films became longer and more complex, the need for a screenplay became more prominent in the industry. The introduction of movie theaters also impacted the development of screenplays, as audiences became more widespread and sophisticated, so the stories had to be as well. Once the first non-silent movie was released in 1927, screenwriting became a hugely important position within Hollywood. The \\"studio system\\" of the 1930s only heightened this importance, as studio heads wanted productivity. Thus, having the \\"blueprint\\" (continuity screenplay) of the film beforehand became extremely optimal. Around 1970, the \\"spec script\\" was first created, and changed the industry for writers forever. Now, screenwriting for television (teleplays) is considered as difficult and competitive as writing is for feature films. Portrayed in film Screenwriting has been the focus of a number of films: * Crashing Hollywood (1931)--A screenwriter collaborates on a gangster movie with a real-life gangster. When the film is released, the mob doesn't like how accurate the movie is. * Sunset Boulevard (1950)--Actor William Holden portrays a hack screenwriter forced to collaborate on a screenplay with a desperate, fading silent film star, played by Gloria Swanson. *In a Lonely Place (1950)--Humphrey Bogart is a washed up screenwriter who gets framed for murder. * Paris, When it Sizzles (1964)--William Holden plays a drunk screenwriter who has wasted months partying and has just two days to finish his script. He hires Audrey Hepburn to help. * Barton Fink (1991)--John Turturro plays a na√Øve New York playwright who comes to Hollywood with high hopes and great ambition. While there, he meets one of his writing idols, a celebrated novelist from the past who has become a drunken hack screenwriter (a character based on William Faulkner). * Mistress (1992)--In this comedy written by Barry Primus and J. F. Lawton, Robert Wuhl is a screenwriter/director who's got integrity, vision, and a serious script -- but no career. Martin Landau is a sleazy producer who introduces Wuhl to Robert De Niro, Danny Aiello and Eli Wallach - three guys willing to invest in the movie, but with one catch: each one wants his mistress to be the star. * The Player (1992)--In this satire of the Hollywood system, Tim Robbins plays a movie producer who thinks he's being blackmailed by a screenwriter whose script was rejected. * Adaptation (2002)--Nicolas Cage portrays real-life screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (as well as his fictional brother, Donald) as Kaufman struggles to adapt an esoteric book (Susan Orlean‚Äôs real-life nonfiction work The Orchid Thief ) into an action-filled Hollywood screenplay. * Dreams on Spec (2007)--The only documentary to follow aspiring screenwriters as they struggle to turn their scripts into movies, the film also features wisdom from established scribes like James L. Brooks, Nora Ephron, Carrie Fisher, and Gary Ross. * Seven Psychopaths (2012)--In this satire, written and directed by Martin McDonagh, Colin Farrell plays a screenwriter who is struggling to finish his screenplay Seven Psychopaths, but finds unlikely inspiration after his best friend steals a Shih Tzu owned by a vicious gangster. * Trumbo (2015)--Highly successful Hollywood screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, played in this biopic by Bryan Cranston, is targeted by the House Un-American Activities Committee for his socialist views, sent to federal prison for refusing to cooperate, and blacklisted from working in Hollywood, yet continues to write and subsequently wins two Academy Awards while using pseudonyms. Copyright protection =United States= In the United States, completed works may be copyrighted, but ideas and plots may not be. Any document written after 1978 in the U.S. is automatically copyrighted even without legal registration or notice. However, the Library of Congress will formally register a screenplay. U.S. Courts will not accept a lawsuit alleging that a defendant is infringing on the plaintiff's copyright in a work until the plaintiff registers the plaintiff's claim to those copyrights with the Copyright Office.17 USC 411 (United States Code, Title 17, Section 411) This means that a plaintiff's attempts to remedy an infringement will be delayed during the registration process.U.S. Copyright Office Circular 1 Additionally, in many infringement cases, the plaintiff will not be able recoup attorney fees or collect statutory damages for copyright infringement, unless the plaintiff registered before the infringement began.17 USC 412 For the purpose of establishing evidence that a screenwriter is the author of a particular screenplay (but not related to the legal copyrighting status of a work), the Writers Guild of America registers screenplays. However, since this service is one of record keeping and is not regulated by law, a variety of commercial and non-profit organizations exist for registering screenplays. Protection for teleplays, formats, as well as screenplays may be registered for instant proof-of-authorship by third-party assurance vendors. There is a line of precedent in several states (including California and New York) that allows for \\"idea submission\\" claims, based on the notion that submission of a screenplay‚Äîor even a mere pitch for one‚Äîto a studio under very particular sets of factual circumstances could potentially give rise to an implied contract to pay for the ideas embedded in that screenplay, even if an alleged derivative work does not actually infringe the screenplay author's copyright. The unfortunate side effect of such precedents (which were supposed to protect screenwriters) is that it is now that much harder to break into screenwriting. Naturally, motion picture and television production firms responded by categorically declining to read all unsolicited screenplays from unknown writers; accepting screenplays only through official channels like talent agents, managers, and attorneys; and forcing screenwriters to sign broad legal releases before their screenplays will be actually accepted, read, or considered. In turn, agents, managers, and attorneys have become extremely powerful gatekeepers on behalf of the major film studios and media networks. One symptom of how hard it is to break into screenwriting as a result of such case law is that in 2008, Universal Studios resisted construction of a bike path along the Los Angeles River next to its studio lot because it would worsen their existing problem with desperate amateur screenwriters throwing copies of their work over the studio wall.

Its projects include the The Lens, formerly known as Patent Lens, and the Biological Innovation for Open Society Initiative. Cambia derives its name from the Spanish verb cambiar, to change.https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cambiar History Cambia was established in 1992 by Richard Anthony Jefferson, a leading molecular biologist responsible for the invention of the GUS reporter system, with substantial early participation by Steven G Hughes, Kate J. Wilson, Andrzej Kilian, Chris A. Fields and Sujata Lakhani. Jefferson describes his vision to found a non-profit organisation in Innovations, to provide more efficient and effective tools to solve the problems of agriculture and society. In 1992, Cambia relocated to Canberra, Australia from The Netherlands, to oversee and troubleshoot the Rockefeller Foundation's rice biotechnology network in Asia. During this time, Jefferson, Wilson and the growing Cambia team visited hundreds of laboratories to help develop, improve, and apply biotechnology capabilities, particularly pertaining to rice. Cambia offered scientific courses and workshops, and increasing assistance in Intellectual Property management. Cambia's ethic was influenced by Jefferson's early years in enabling technology invention and distribution, but greatly refined through increasing awareness of socially and scientifically complex systems and using new thinking about biological evolution (including the Hologenome Theory of Evolution) as models for institution building and collaboration. Cambia became one of the first social enterprises to use a hybrid licensing model to fund its public good activities. By selectively patenting important technologies, then creating tiered licensing models for their use, Cambia was able to ensure all parties fair access, but larger licensees would be required to pay more for their non-exclusive use, thus subsidising new developments and distribution and support to less wealthy users, including small enterprises and the public sector in the developing world. This model - developed also by the social entrepreneur David Green for universal access to eye care - is now becoming a pillar of social enterprise function. Over time Cambia's focus moved away from biotechnology and towards innovation systems and Intellectual Property. The Patent Lens and its successor The Lens are now the primary focus of Cambia. Cambia's goal has always been to enable and democratise innovation and their move towards free and open tools that help people understand intellectual property landscapes is a continuation of those values. In this way they have changed from a wet-science research institute into a strategic system-changing social enterprise. In 2012 and 2013, Cambia was rated among the top 100 best NGOs globally by The Global Journal. Projects Cambia's work to freely distribute scientific tools and techniques gave rise to the Biological Open Source (BiOS) Initiative in 2005. Through an open-source biotechnology license and Material Transfer Agreement (MTA) developed in 2005-2007, BiOS sought to establish freedom to operate for innovators by providing and exemplifying legal instruments by which innovators could collaboratively use intellectual property protection as a means to share and jointly improve technology for wider utility. BiOS was built on the back of Jefferson's invention of the GUS-based reporter system and the creation of TransBacter, a work-around for the creation of transgenic plants bypassing the highly patented Agrobacterium genus. Another of Cambia's projects was the development in 2001 by then Chief Scientist Andrzej Kilian of Diversity Arrays Technology, a solid state sequence agnostic genotyping technology that was spun off into a company, DArT, Pty Ltd to perform agricultural genotyping services to the plant breeding community. A principal current project of Cambia is the free full-text online patent search and exploration facility and knowledge resource, The Lens (previously the Patent Lens). Launched in 2000 with funding from the Rockefeller Foundation as a US agricultural patent search facility, and substantially expanded in 2005-2007 to encompass patent documents from multiple jurisdictions and all domains, and information on the linkages between patent applications and the status of granted patents, the Patent Lens allowed free searching of almost 10 million full-text patent documents. It was distinguished as being the only not-for-profit facility of its kind, with international coverage and integrated links to non-patent literature. The Lens was launched in 2013 as the successor to the Patent Lens, making strides in the visual presentation of patent analysis and workspace management; it is the only global patent site with fully open, shareable, annotatable and re-usable data collections. The Lens now hosts more than 111.5 million patent records and over 60.6 million patent families from over 95 different jurisdictions, including European Patent Office (EPO), United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), IP Australia, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). The Lens also features an open biological patent facility, PatSeq, led by Professor Osmat Jefferson, with many advanced tools for searching and analysing biological sequences found in patents, to render gene patenting more transparent. The facility has mapped sequences disclosed in gene patents onto the genomes of humans, mice, maize, rice, soybean and others and enable searching at the genome, gene and individual sequence level. The Lens now hosts more than 287 million biological sequences. In 2017, Professor Osmat Jefferson directed the launching of Lens influence mapping facilities, PatCite and QUT In4M, enabling users to map and measure the influence of scholarly works on invention and innovation. The Lens and its new global In4M Ranking system feature prominently in the Nature Index 2017 Innovation supplement, published in leading science journal Nature and the seminal paper describing the granular metrics and the rankings options was published in the journal Nature Biotechnology. In December 2017, The Lens became more than a patent and sequence facility with the launch of scholarly works search. Initially exposing the scholarly works cited in the patent literature, The Lens now hosts and serves scholarly works from more than 195.5 million scholarly records from multiple sources including Microsoft Academic, Crossref, ORCID, PubMed, Impactstory and CORE. Governance Cambia is a social enterprise, and is a registered Non-Governmental Organisation with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and a registered observer with the World Intellectual Property Organization. Within Australia, Cambia is registered with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) as a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee. Cambia‚Äôs governance is overseen by a Board of Directors, according to its constitution. Locations As of July 2012, Cambia operates principally from headquarters in Canberra, ACT, with some staff based in Brisbane, Australia, at the Queensland University of Technology. Before its move to Brisbane in 2008, where it operated for four years, Cambia was located on the Black Mountain research campus of the CSIRO while its glasshouse facilities were housed at the Australian National University campus.

St. Jude treats infants, children, teens, and young adults up to age 21 and for some conditions, age 25. History St. Jude was founded by entertainer Danny Thomas in 1962, with help from Lemuel Diggs and Thomas' close friend from Miami, automobile dealer Anthony Abraham. The hospital was founded on the premise that \\"no child should die in the dawn of life\\". This idea resulted from a promise that Thomas, a Maronite Catholic, had made to a saint years before the hospital was founded. Thomas was a comedian who was struggling to get a break in his career and living paycheck to paycheck. When his first child was about to be born, he attended Mass in Detroit, and put his last $7.00 in the offering bin. He prayed to Saint Jude Thaddeus for a means to provide for his family, and about a week later, he obtained a gig that paid 10 times what he had put in the offering bin. After that time, Thomas believed in the power of prayer. He promised St. Jude Thaddeus that if the saint made him successful, he would one day build him a shrine. Years later, Thomas became an extremely successful comedian and built St. Jude Children's Research Hospital as a shrine to St. Jude Thaddeus to honor his promise. In 1957, Thomas, a Lebanese-American, founded the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC), which helped him realize his dream. ALSAC is also the fundraising organization of St. Jude. Since St. Jude opened its doors in 1962, ALSAC has had the responsibility of raising the necessary funds to keep the hospital open. Memphis was chosen at the suggestion of Catholic Cardinal Samuel Stritch, a Tennessee native who had been a spiritual advisor to Thomas since he presided at Thomas's confirmation in Thomas's boyhood home of Toledo, Ohio. Although it was named after Thomas's patron saint, St. Jude is not a Catholic hospital and is a secular institution not affiliated with any religious organization. In 2007, Chili's restaurant chain pledged $50 million to fund the construction of the seven-story Chili's Care Center, adding , providing space for the department of radiological services, The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, two floors of outpatient clinics, one floor of inpatient clinics and rooms, two floors of laboratory space, an office floor and an unfinished level for future expansion. In June 2008, Kay Kafe, funded by Sterling Jewelers, was opened. The space features a lounge area, a large dining area and a variety of new dining options, providing an area where families and staff can relax away from the treatment areas. In 2014, the Marlo Thomas Center for Global Education and Collaboration was opened as part of the hospital. In 2017, the St. Jude Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences accepted its inaugural class of PhD students. The hospital A child playing congas in the Amy Grant Music Room at Target House, one of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital's housing facilities. Discoveries at St. Jude have profoundly changed how doctors treat children with cancer and other catastrophic illnesses. Since St. Jude was established, the survival rate for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the most common type of childhood cancer, has increased from 4 percent in 1962 to 94 percent today. During this time, the overall survival rate for childhood cancers has risen from 20 percent to 80 percent. St. Jude has treated children from across the United States and from more than 70 countries. Doctors around the world consult with St. Jude on their toughest cases. Also, St. Jude has an International Outreach Program to improve the survival rates of children with catastrophic illnesses worldwide through the transfer of knowledge, technology and organizational skills. St. Jude treats infants, children, teens, and young adults up to age 21 and for some conditions, age 25. Corporate structure Donald Pinkel was the first director of St. Jude and served from 1962 until 1973. His successor, Alvin Mauer, was director from 1973 to 1983. Joseph Simone was the hospital's third director from 1983 to 1992. Arthur W. Nienhuis was CEO and director of St. Jude from 1993 until 2004. William E. Evans, the hospital's fifth director, served from 2004 to 2014. He was succeeded by current CEO and director James R. Downing on July 15, 2014. , St. Jude's scientific director was James I. Morgan, Ph.D. St. Jude's board of directors is chaired by Christopher B. George, MD, and includes Joyce Aboussie, Ruth Gaviria and Tony Thomas (producer). Awards and achievements St. Jude and over 46 of its staff members have been the recipients of numerous exemplary awards and achievements. For example, in 2010 St. Jude Children's Research Hospital was named the number one children's cancer hospital in the U.S by U.S. News & World Report. It has also been named one of the top 10 companies to work for in academia by The Scientist for 7 successive years. Most notably, Peter C. Doherty, Ph.D., of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital was co-recipient of the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for work related to how the immune system kills virus-infected cells. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital won the 2020 Webby Award for Health & Fitness in the category Apps, Mobile & Voice. Affiliated hospitals St. Jude is associated with several affiliated hospitals in the United States to further its efforts beyond its own physical walls. The hospital uses its Domestic Affiliates Program to form this partnership with the other pediatric programs. This program is a network of hematology clinics, hospitals, and universities that are united under the mission of St. Jude. These sites are used as a means of referring eligible patients to St. Jude as well as a location to administer some care. Through the Domestic Affiliates Program staff at St. Jude work together and collaborate with those at the other institutions. Affiliated sites are expected to comply with standards set by St. Jude and are audited to ensure proper and quality care. Currently the Domestic Affiliate Clinic sites include: * Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana * Novant Health Hemby Children's Hospital, in Charlotte, North Carolina * Huntsville Hospital for Women & Children, in Huntsville, Alabama * Johnson City Medical Center, in Johnson City, Tennessee * St. Jude Midwest Affiliate, Children's Hospital of Illinois in Peoria, Illinois * Louisiana State University, Department of Pediatrics, in Shreveport, Louisiana * Mercy Children's Hospital, in Springfield, Missouri * The Children's Hospital at Saint Francis, in Tulsa, Oklahoma St. Jude also works closely with Le Bonheur Children's Medical Center, also located in downtown Memphis. St. Jude patients needing certain procedures, such as brain surgery, may undergo procedures at LeBonheur Hospital. Both St. Jude and Le Bonheur are teaching hospitals affiliated with the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. University of Tennessee physicians training in pediatrics, surgery, radiology, and other specialties undergo service rotations at St. Jude Hospital. The Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon was established in Beirut on April 12, 2002. The center is an affiliate of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and works in association with the American University of Beirut Medical Center (AUBMC). A commitment has been made to establish a research facility in Memphis, Tennessee, one purpose of which will be to serve as a collaborative hub. Funding St. Jude's is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization with annual expenses, as of 2018, of over $1.4 billion funded by nearly $1.5 billion in donations. Donations for St. Jude comes from many sources, including government grants and insurance recoveries, but the principal source of funding (75% average) is from the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities (ALSAC) - a semi-independent entity that raises funds using the name of St. Jude. Of a dollar donated to the American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities, about $0.82 goes directly to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. All medically eligible patients who are accepted for treatment at St. Jude are treated without regard to the family's ability to pay. St. Jude is one of a few pediatric research organizations in the United States where families never pay for treatments that are not covered by insurance, and families without insurance are never asked to pay. In addition to providing medical services to eligible patients, St. Jude also assists families with transportation, lodging, and meals. Three separate specially-designed patient housing facilities‚Äî Tri Delta Place for short-term (up to one week), Ronald McDonald House for medium-term (one week to 3 months), and Target House for long-term (3 months or more)‚Äîprovide housing for patients and up to three family members, with no cost to the patient. These policies, along with research expenses and other costs, cause the hospital to incur more than $2.4 million in operating costs each day. =Philanthropic aid= From 2000 to 2005, 83.7% of every dollar received by St. Jude went to the current or future needs of St. Jude. In 2002 to 2004, 47% of program expenses went to patient care and 41% to research. As of 2012, 81 cents of every dollar donated to St. Jude goes directly to its research and treatment. To cover operating costs, ALSAC conducts many fund-raising events and activities. The WGC Invitational, a PGA Tour event, is one of the most visible fund-raising events for the hospital. Other fund-raising programs include the St. Jude Math-A-Thon, Up 'til Dawn, direct mailings, radiothons and television marketing. St. Jude also has a merchandise catalog called the Hope Catalog. The catalog contains everything from shirts to office items, and from patient art to \\"Give Thanks\\" wristbands. =Thanks and Giving= In November 2004, St. Jude launched its inaugural Thanks and Giving campaign which encourages consumers to help raise funds at participating retailers by adding a donation at checkout or by purchasing specialty items to benefit St. Jude. The campaign is supported by network television spots, advertisements in major publications, interactive marketing on Yahoo! and a movie trailer that runs on 20,000 screens nationwide, runs from Thanksgiving until the New Year. The campaign was created by St. Jude National Outreach Director Marlo Thomas and her siblings Terre Thomas and Tony Thomas, children of hospital founder Danny Thomas. Customers nationwide are asked to help raise funds at participating retailers by adding a donation at check out or by purchasing specialty items to benefit St. Jude. Corporations give customers a host of opportunities to support St. Jude. The ultimate goal is to increase awareness with the hope that people will come to identify Thanksgiving with St. Jude, said Joyce Aboussie, vice chairwoman of the nonprofit's board. The official kick-off event for the Thanks and Giving campaign is the Give Thanks Walk. This event is a noncompetitive 5K that is now held in 75 cities across the country. Those participating in the race are encouraged to form teams, invite family and friends, and raise money for St. Jude. These walks have raised over $11 million to date. =Other funding initiatives= One of the hospital's most recent and successful fund-raising efforts has been the Dream Home Giveaway. The giveaway allows contest entrants to reserve tickets for $100 each to qualify to win homes valued between $300,000 and $600,000. The Dream Home Giveaway, one of the largest national fund-raising programs, is conducted in cities across the United States. Many high schools around the country are creating student-led and student-run organizations called Team Up for St. Jude. These programs consist of high school students putting on events that raise funds and awareness for St. Jude while showing their school spirit. One of the main events is a letter-writing campaign in which the students are sent pre-written letters that include stories of a patient and ask for donations. The high school students often have a \\"letter-writing party\\" to address and send the letters to their family and friends asking them to support St. Jude. Hoover High School (Hoover, AL) has a program that has brought in many fundraising ideas including \\"Team Up Week\\" which consists of prize wheels, inflatables, karaoke, cake walk, etc. to raise funds and awareness for the hospital. Though this program is done on a much a smaller scale than the college program Up 'til Dawn, it has the potential to grow and increase awareness. At various college campuses, some student organizations, fraternities and sororities raise funds in a program called Up 'til Dawn Phi Mu Delta National Fraternity is partnered with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. The fraternity's second core belief, \\"I Believe in Service... service to the college; service to every group organized for the common good; service to the individual. I believe in service defined in the terms of voluntary sacrifice for the welfare of those with whom I come in contact.\\" has helped shape many young men of admirable quality and exceptional character towards a dedication to St. Jude and other equally important causes. Tau Kappa Epsilon (TKE) Fraternity partnered with St. Jude in the 1970s and 1980s to help raise money to fight childhood cancer. The fraternity renewed its link to St. Jude as its philanthropy of emphasis in 2008. St. Jude is an International Philanthropic Project of Epsilon Sigma Alpha International, a co-ed service sorority. As of April 2013, ESA has raised more than $160 million in cash and pledges for St. Jude. In 1999, the Delta Delta Delta collegiate sorority formed a philanthropic partnership with St. Jude. Tri Delta supports St. Jude nationally and supports cancer charities at a local level. At the hospital in Memphis, the sorority donated the Teen Room for teenage patients to relax and spend time with each other. In July 2010, Tri Delta completed its \\"10 by 10\\" goal, raising over $10 million in less than four years, six years short of the original goal. Those funds were used to sponsor the Tri Delta Patient Care Floor in the Chili's Care Center. Upon completion of the \\"10 by 10\\" campaign, the sorority announced a new fundraising goal of $15 million in 5 years to name the Specialty Clinic located in the Patient Care Center. Three and a half years later, Delta Delta Delta had raised $15 million and completed its goal ahead of schedule. In July 2014, the on-campus residence center was renamed Tri Delta Place as a result of Tri Delta's pledge of $60 Million in 10 years. In July 2005, Kappa Alpha Psi (ŒöŒëŒ®) fraternity announced St. Jude Children's Research Hospital as its national philanthropic partner. Since that time, members across the country have joined in the fight against pediatric cancer, sickle cell disease, and other catastrophic illnesses. Kappa Alpha Psi has answered the call to service by raising more than $400,000‚Äîrepresenting the largest contribution that Kappa Alpha Psi has donated to any charity. Members of Kappa Alpha Psi have committed to raise $500,000 in support of the hospital's sickle cell program. St. Jude has one of the largest pediatric sickle cell research and treatment programs in the world. St. Jude is the first known hospital in the world to cure sickle cell disease through bone marrow transplantation. Today, bone marrow transplantation still offers the only cure for sickle cell disease. Members of Kappa Alpha Psi reach out to churches in their local communities to host a Sunday of Hope each January in support of St. Jude. January was selected because this is the month of Kappa's founding. During the Sunday of Hope, churches will take up a special offering in honor of the patients and families of St. Jude. At the 2008 ALSAC/St. Jude Board and Awards Dinner, Kappa Alpha Psi received the Volunteer Group of the Year Award for their efforts in the inaugural year of the Sunday of Hope program which secured more than 130 churches to participate and raised more than $280,000. Lambda Theta Alpha sorority serves thousands of hours each year to a variety of philanthropic causes and needs. In the effort to create a more united and bigger impact nationally, Lambda Theta Alpha selected a national philanthropy. In January 2010, LTA became an official collegiate partner to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, becoming the first individual Latino Greek organization to commit fully to the hospital's efforts. LTA has pledged to raise awareness about childhood cancer and St. Jude in the Latin community, as well as fundraise for the hospital through a variety of events and programs. Past events have included: sporting tournaments, charity galas, informational meetings, and much more. Another successful event is the Country Cares for St. Jude Kids radiothon. During these events, country radio stations around the country allow those touched by St. Jude to share stories with listeners, highlighting patient stories, and having exciting promotions. Listeners are encouraged to call in and become a Partner In Hope by making either a one-time or monthly donation to the hospital. The 200 stations involved have helped raise over $400 million since 1989. Country artists have also supported St. Jude through concerts, hospital visits, call-ins, and other forms of support. Eagles for St. Jude was a program created in 2007 by Stanford Financial Group, when it paid to become title sponsor of the St. Jude Classic, the annual PGA Tour event in Memphis. The program, and sponsorship, ended in February 2009, when it was found that Stanford Financial Group was nothing more than a Ponzi scheme, having defrauded investors out of $8 billion, with a small fraction of that stolen money having been channeled into the Eagles for St. Jude program. =McDonald's Monopoly Game= In 1995, St. Jude received an anonymous letter postmarked in Dallas, Texas, containing a $1 million winning McDonald's Monopoly game piece. McDonald's officials came to the hospital, accompanied by a representative from the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, and verified it as a winner. Although game rules prohibited the transfer of prizes, and even after learning that the piece was sent by an individual involved in an embezzlement scheme intended to defraud McDonald's, McDonald's waived the rule and made the annual $50,000 annuity payments. Celebrity visitors Over the years, many celebrities such as musicians, political figures, actors and others have become involved with this foundation, visiting the hospital to meet some of the kids and/or filming commercials to encourage individuals to donate to St. Jude.

Single Frequency Network model Top:Multi Frequency Network Bottom:Single Frequency Network Analog AM and FM radio broadcast networks as well as digital broadcast networks can operate in this manner. SFNs are not generally compatible with analog television transmission, since the SFN results in ghosting due to echoes of the same signal. A simplified form of SFN can be achieved by a low power co-channel repeater, booster or broadcast translator, which is utilized as gap filler transmitter. The aim of SFNs is efficient utilization of the radio spectrum, allowing a higher number of radio and TV programs in comparison to traditional multi-frequency network (MFN) transmission. An SFN may also increase the coverage area and decrease the outage probability in comparison to an MFN, since the total received signal strength may increase to positions midway between the transmitters. SFN schemes are somewhat analogous to what in non-broadcast wireless communication, for example cellular networks and wireless computer networks, is called transmitter macrodiversity, CDMA soft handoff and Dynamic Single Frequency Networks (DSFN). SFN transmission can be considered as a severe form of multipath propagation. The radio receiver receives several echoes of the same signal, and the constructive or destructive interference among these echoes (also known as self-interference) may result in fading. This is problematic especially in wideband communication and high-data rate digital communications, since the fading in that case is frequency-selective (as opposed to flat fading), and since the time spreading of the echoes may result in intersymbol interference (ISI). Fading and ISI can be avoided by means of diversity schemes and equalization filters.  OFDM and COFDM  In wideband digital broadcasting, self-interference cancellation is facilitated by the OFDM or COFDM modulation method. OFDM uses a large number of slow low- bandwidth modulators instead of one fast wide-band modulator. Each modulator has its own frequency sub-channel and sub-carrier frequency. Since each modulator is very slow, we can afford to insert a guard interval between the symbols, and thus eliminate the ISI. Although the fading is frequency- selective over the whole frequency channel, it can be considered as flat within the narrowband sub-channel. Thus, advanced equalization filters can be avoided. A forward error correction code (FEC) can counteract that a certain portion of the sub-carriers are exposed to too much fading to be correctly demodulated. OFDM is utilized in the terrestrial digital TV broadcasting systems DVB-T (used in Europe and many other areas), ISDB-T (used in Japan and Brazil) and in ATSC 3.0. OFDM is also widely used in digital radio systems, including DAB, HD Radio, and T-DMB. Therefore, these systems are well-suited to SFN operation.  DVB-T SFN  In DVB-T a SFN functionality is described as a system in the implementation guide.ETSI TR 101 190: Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Implementation guidelines for DVB terrestrial services; Transmission aspects It allows for re-transmitters, gap-filler transmitters (essentially a low-power synchronous transmitter) and use of SFN between main transmitter towers. The DVB-T SFN uses the fact that the guard interval of the COFDM signal allows for various length of path echoes to occur is not different from that of multiple transmitters transmitting the same signal onto the same frequency. The critical parameters is that it needs to occur about in the same time and at the same frequency. The versatility of time-transfer systems such as GPS receivers (here assumed to provide PPS and 10 MHz signals) as well as other similar systems allows for phase and frequency coordination among the transmitters. The guard interval allows for a timing budget, of which several microseconds may be allocated to time errors of the time- transfer system used. A GPS receiver worst-case scenario is able to provide +/- 1 ¬µs time, well within the system needs of DVB-T SFN in typical configuration. In order to achieve the same transmission time on all transmitters, the transmission delay in the network providing the transport to the transmitters needs to be considered. Since the delay from the originating site to the transmitter varies, a system is needed to add delay on the output side such that the signal reaches the transmitters at the same time. This is achieved by the use of special information inserted into the data stream called the Mega-frame Initialization Packet (MIP) which is inserted using a special marker in the MPEG-2 Transport Stream forming a mega-frame. The MIP is time-stamped in the SFN adapter, as measured relative the PPS signal and counted in 100 ns steps (period time of 10 MHz) with the maximum delay (programmed into the SFN adapter) alongside. The SYNC adapter measures the MIP packet against its local variant of PPS using the 10 MHz to measure the actual network delay and then withholding the packets until the maximum delay is achieved. The details is to be found in ETSI TR 101 190 and mega-frame details in ETSI TS 101 191.ETSI TS 101 191: Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); DVB mega-frame for Single Frequency Network (SFN) synchronization It should be understood that the resolution of the mega-frame format is being in steps of 100 ns, whereas the accuracy needs can be in the range of 1-5 ¬µs. The resolution is sufficient for the needed accuracy. There is no strict need for an accuracy limit as this is a network planning aspect, in which the guard- interval is being separated into system time error and path time-error. A 100 ns step represents a 30 m difference, while 1 ¬µs represents a 300 m difference. These distances needs to be compared with the worst-case distance between transmitter towers and reflections. Also, the time accuracy relates to nearby towers in a SFN domain, since a receiver is not expected to see the signal from transmission towers being geographically far apart, so there is no accuracy requirements between these towers. So called GPS-free solutions exist, which essentially replace GPS as the timing distribution system. Such system may provide benefit in integration with transmission system for the MPEG-2 Transport Stream. It does not change any other aspect of the SFN system as the basic requirements can be met. ATSC and 8VSB While not designed with on-channel repeaters in mind, the 8VSB modulation method used in North America for digital TV is relatively good at ghost cancellation. Early experiments at WPSU-TV led to an ATSC standard for SFNs, A/110. ATSC SFNs have seen widest use in mountainous areas like Puerto Rico and Southern California, but are also in use or planned in gentler terrain.http://www.rabbitears.info/oddsandends.php?request=drlist&class;=DD Early ATSC tuners were not very good at handling multipath propagation, but later systems have seen significant improvements. https://www.fcc.gov/oet/info/documents/reports/TR-05-1017-ATSC-reception- testing.pdf Through the use of virtual channel numbering, a multi-frequency network (MFN) can appear as an SFN to the viewer in ATSC. Alternative modulations Alternatives to using OFDM modulation in SFN self-interference cancellation would be: * CDMA Rake receivers. * MIMO channels (i.e. phased array antenna) * Single-carrier frequency-domain-equalization (SC-FDE), i.e. single-carrier modulation combined with guard intervals and FFT-based frequency domain equalization, or its multi-user version Single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA).

The book is considered a seminal text for the Situationist movement. Debord published a follow-up book Comments on the Society of the Spectacle in 1988.Debord (1988) Comments on the Society of the Spectacle. Summary The work is a series of 221 short theses in the form of aphorisms. Each thesis contains one paragraph. =Degradation of human life= Debord traces the development of a modern society in which authentic social life has been replaced with its representation: \\"All that once was directly lived has become mere representation.\\" Debord argues that the history of social life can be understood as \\"the decline of being into having, and having into merely appearing.\\"Debord (1967) thesis 17 This condition, according to Debord, is the \\"historical moment at which the commodity completes its colonization of social life.\\"Debord (1994) thesis 42. The spectacle is the inverted image of society in which relations between commodities have supplanted relations between people, in which \\"passive identification with the spectacle supplants genuine activity\\". \\"The spectacle is not a collection of images,\\" Debord writes, \\"rather, it is a social relation among people, mediated by images.\\"Debord (1994) thesis 4. In his analysis of the spectacular society, Debord notes that the quality of life is impoverished, with such a lack of authenticity that human perceptions are affected, and an attendant degradation of knowledge, which in turn hinders critical thought.Debord (1977) from thesis 25: \\"All community and all critical sense are dissolved\\" Debord analyzes the use of knowledge to assuage reality: the spectacle obfuscates the past, imploding it with the future into an undifferentiated mass, a type of never-ending present; in this way the spectacle prevents individuals from realizing that the society of spectacle is only a moment in history, one that can be overturned through revolution.Debord (1967) thesis 11Debord (1967) thesis 143 Debord's aim and proposal is \\"to wake up the spectator who has been drugged by spectacular images...through radical action in the form of the construction of situations...situations that bring a revolutionary reordering of life, politics, and art\\". In the Situationist view, situations are actively created moments characterized by \\"a sense of self-consciousness of existence within a particular environment or ambience\\".Ford (1950) Debord encouraged the use of d√©tournement, \\"which involves using spectacular images and language to disrupt the flow of the spectacle.\\" =Mass media and commodity fetishism= The Society of the Spectacle is a critique of contemporary consumer culture and commodity fetishism, dealing with issues such as class alienation, cultural homogenization, and mass media. When Debord says that \\"All that was once directly lived has become mere representation,\\" he is referring to the central importance of the image in contemporary society. Images, Debord says, have supplanted genuine human interaction.Debord (1994) Thesis 1 Thus, Debord's fourth thesis is: \\"The spectacle is not a collection of images; rather, it is a social relationship between people that is mediated by images.\\"Debord (1994) Thesis 4 In a consumer society, social life is not about living, but about having; the spectacle uses the image to convey what people need and must have. Consequently, social life moves further, leaving a state of \\"having\\" and proceeding into a state of \\"appearing\\"; namely the appearance of the image.Debord (1994) Thesis 17 \\"In a world which really is topsy-turvy, the true is a moment of the false.\\"Debord (1977) Thesis 9 =Comparison between religion and marketing= Debord also draws an equivalence between the role of mass media marketing in the present and the role of religions in the past.from Debord (1977) thesis 20: \\"The spectacle is the material reconstruction of the religious illusion.\\"Debord (1967) thesis 25 on the spectacle and the sacred The spread of commodity-images by the mass media, produces \\"waves of enthusiasm for a given product\\" resulting in \\"moments of fervent exaltation similar to the ecstasies of the convulsions and miracles of the old religious fetishism\\".Debord (1977) Thesis 67from Debord (1977) thesis 132: \\"The masters who make history their private property, under the protection of myth, possess first of all a private ownership of the mode of illusionn: in China and Egypt they long held a monopoly over the immortality of the soul ... The growth of their real historical power goes together with a popularization of the possession of myth and illusion.\\" Debord contends further that \\"the remains of religion and of the family (the principal relic of the heritage of class power) and the moral repression they assure, merge whenever the enjoyment of this world is affirmed‚Äìthis world being nothing other than repressive pseudo-enjoyment.\\"Debord (1977) Thesis 59 \\"The monotheistic religions were a compromise between myth and history, ... These religions arose on the soil of history, and established themselves there. But there they still preserve themselves in radical opposition to history.\\" Debord defines them as Semi-historical religion.Debord (1994) thesis 136 \\"The growth of knowledge about society, which includes the understanding of history as the heart of culture, derives from itself an irreversible knowledge, which is expressed by the destruction of God.\\"Debord (1977) thesis 182 =Critique of American sociology= In Chapter 8, \\"Negation and Consumption Within Culture\\", Debord includes a critical analysis of the works of three American sociologists. Debord discusses at length Daniel J. Boorstin's The Image (1961), arguing that Boorstin missed the concept of Spectacle. In thesis 192, Debord mentions some American sociologists who have described the general project of developed capitalism which \\"aims to recapture the fragmented worker as a personality well integrated in the group;\\" the examples mentioned by Debord are David Riesman, author of The Lonely Crowd (1950), and William H. Whyte, author of the 1956 bestseller The Organization Man.Debord (1977) theses 192, 196-200, Among the 1950s sociologists who are usually compared to Riesman and Whyte, is C. Wright Mills, author of White Collar: The American Middle Classes.American Quarterly 1963 Riesman's \\"Lonely Crowd\\" term is also used in thesis 28. =Authenticity, plagiarism, and Lautr√©amont= Because the notion of the spectacle involves real life being replaced by representations of real life, Society of the Spectacle is also concerned with the notion of authenticity versus inauthenticity, a theme which is revisited in Chapter 8, \\"Negation and Consumption within Culture\\". In Debord's treatment, modern society forces culture to constantly re-appropriate or re-invent itself, copying and re-packaging old ideas. Thesis 207 makes this point, rhetorically: \\"Ideas improve. The meaning of words participates in the improvement. Plagiarism is necessary. Progress implies it. It embraces an author's phrase, makes use of his expressions, erases a false idea, and replaces it with the right idea.\\"Debord (1977) thesis 207 This passage concerning plagiarism is itself directly lifted from Po√©sies by French-Uruguayan author Isidore Lucien Ducasse, better known as the Comte de Lautr√©amont. In particular, the original French text for both Debord and Lautr√©amont's versions of the passage are identical: \\"Les id√©es s'am√©liorent. Le sens des mots y participe. Le plagiat est n√©cessaire. Le progr√®s l'implique. Il serre de pr√®s la phrase d'un auteur, se sert de ses expressions, efface une id√©e fausse, la remplace par l'id√©e juste.\\" =The spectacle and politics= A number of political theorists have argued that liberal democracy has been overtaken by spectacle. Douglas Kellner (2003, 2016) argues that politics has become obsessed with spectacular imagery, as evidenced by the rise of Donald Trump in the United States (2016). Similarly Tauel Harper (2011) argues that our social formations and political practices are constructed and sustained by the logics of spectacle and render us as homo spectaculum or 'beings of the spectacle'.

History  XHKS poster showing Ogaden as part of Greater Somalia SRSP was created by the military regime of Siad Barre under Soviet guidance. A founding congress was held in June 1976. The congress elected a Central Committee, with Barre as the party general secretary. A five-member politburo, consisting of Barre, Lt. General Muhammad Ali Samatar (vice president), Major General Husseen Kulmiye (2nd vice president), Brig. Ahmad Sulaymaan Abdullah and Brig. Ismail Ali Abukor (who was later replaced by Brig.

Weyrah and (a well known socialist economist) and Abukar Sh. M Hussien. During a brief period, prior to the escalation of conflict with Ethiopia in 1977, XHKS developed relations with foreign communist parties, such as the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) and Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). CPSU initiated a programme of assistance for the SRSP party school. After relations with the Soviet Bloc were ruptured, a group including SRSP CC member broke away to form splinter groups. This was even further accelerated by the failed military coup of April 9, 1978, popularly known as \\"Nova Aprile\\". In 1981 dissident factions would emerge as the Democratic Front for Salvation of Somalia. When Barre's regime fell in 1991, SRSP disappeared. In the same year the Somali National Front was organized by Barre loyalists.  Ideology  XHKS poster The SRSP was in theory a Marxist‚ÄìLeninist party, but also included Islamic socialism, scientific socialism, Somali nationalism and pan-Somalism teachings in its ideology. It was dissolved when Mohamed Siad Bare was ejected from power in late 1991.  Organisation  The SRSP was supposed to function as a political force transcending clan lines, but in reality there was little change in political practice. Power was concentrated to three clans. The party developed an intelligence branch, Baadhista xisbiga, which worked parallel to state intelligence and paramilitary groups. At most SRSP had around 20,000 members. XHKS held its 3rd Congress in November 1986. A major reshuffle of the Central Committee took place.

It may be a standalone application or it may be built into an integrated development environment (IDE) or web browser. Source-code editors are a fundamental programming tool, as the fundamental job of programmers is to write and edit source code. Features Source-code editors have features specifically designed to simplify and speed up typing of source code, such as syntax highlighting, indentation, autocomplete and brace matching functionality. These editors also provide a convenient way to run a compiler, interpreter, debugger, or other program relevant for the software-development process. So, while many text editors like Notepad can be used to edit source code, if they don't enhance, automate or ease the editing of code, they are not source-code editors. Structure editors are a different form of source-code editor, where instead of editing raw text, one manipulates the code's structure, generally the abstract syntax tree. In this case features such as syntax highlighting, validation, and code formatting are easily and efficiently implemented from the concrete syntax tree or abstract syntax tree, but editing is often more rigid than free-form text. Structure editors also require extensive support for each language, and thus are harder to extend to new languages than text editors, where basic support only requires supporting syntax highlighting or indentation. For this reason, strict structure editors are not popular for source code editing, though some IDEs provide similar functionality. A source-code editor can check syntax while code is being entered and immediately warn of syntax problems. A few source-code editors compress source code, typically converting common keywords into single-byte tokens, removing unnecessary whitespace, and converting numbers to a binary form. Such tokenizing editors later uncompress the source code when viewing it, possibly prettyprinting it with consistent capitalizing and spacing. A few source-code editors do both.

A double album covering an ambitious range of subject matter from the politics of race to 1970s stadium rock, Southern Rock Opera either imagines, or filters, every topic through the context of legendary Southern band, Lynyrd Skynyrd. The record was originally self- released on Soul Dump Records. The album was re-released on July 16, 2002 by Lost Highway Records. The album was financed by issuing promissory notes in exchange for loans from fans, family and friends of the band. The album's artwork was done by Richmond, Virginia artist Wes Freed. Origin and making of the album The idea for Southern Rock Opera pre-dates the band's formation in 1996. Southern Rock Opera began in a long discussion between Drive-By Truckers' frontman Patterson Hood and former Truckers bassist and producer Earl Hicks, during a road trip. The pair discussed writing a semi- autobiographical screenplay about growing up in the South and about the plane crash that almost ended the career of the rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd, taking singer Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Steve Gaines, and Gaines' back-up-singer sister Cassie Gaines. Soon after this discussion, Hood formed Drive-By Truckers. The Truckers recorded two studio albums and one live album during the four years between their formation and the actual recording of Southern Rock Opera. During these years, Drive-By's principal songwriters Hood, Mike Cooley, and Rob Malone continued to contribute songs to \\"The Rock Opera\\", as they had come to call it. After the release of their live album Alabama Ass Whuppin', Drive-By Truckers began recording what they hoped would be their magnum opus: Southern Rock Opera. According to Patterson Hood, \\"(the album) was recorded in Birmingham, upstairs in a uniform shop during an early September heat wave, with no air-conditioning. We had to turn the fans off when we were recording, and we worked from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. So Southern Rock Opera was fun to write, but we had a miserable time making it.\\" After the album was finished, however, the troubles continued for The Truckers when they ran out of funding for the immense project. To resolve the problem, and to avoid \\"any fine print crap\\", as Hood put it, the band took a non-traditional approach. The Truckers made a prospectus and solicited investors, with a promise of 15% interest, to pay for the manufacturing and distribution of Southern Rock Opera. The approach worked. Through their fan-based online news group and by sheer word of mouth, The Truckers were able to raise $23,000. This allowed them to print about 5,000 copies of the album, and buy a \\"new\\" used van for touring. Notably included in the group, dubbed \\"The DBT Investors\\", was Widespread Panic bassist and fellow Athenian Dave Schools. Southern Rock Opera was finally released on September 12, 2001 on Soul Dump Records. Critical reception The album was voted the 22nd best of the year in the Pazz & Jop music critic poll of 2002. The poll founder, Robert Christgau, named it his 23rd favorite album of 2001. Rhapsody (online music service) ranked the album #6 on its \\"Rock's Best Albums of the Decade\\" list.\\"Rock's Best Albums of the Decade\\" Retrieved 12 January 2010. The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. Re- release The critical praise for Southern Rock Opera created no shortage of buzz around the album and the band. The Truckers did not have the means to press the necessary number of copies of the album on their own. In order to meet demand, Drive-By Truckers signed a large-scale distribution deal with Lost Highway Records. Southern Rock Opera was re-released, this time worldwide, on July 16, 2002.

In Sri Lanka, this bird is known as ' - in Sinhala. It is a very secretive bird, and despite its size is difficult to see as it slips through dense undergrowth. Often the only indication of its presence is its distinctive ringing call, consisting of series of three-syllabled whistles. Kitulgala and Sinharaja are sites where there is a chance of seeing this bird. This spurfowl is one of three species of bird in the genus Galloperdix. It is a ground nesting bird, which lays 2-5 eggs in a scrape. Sri Lanka spurfowl is ~ 37 cm long bird. Both sexes have brown upperparts, wings and tail. The males exhibit vivid crimson red legs and bare facial skin and striking black and white dorsal plumage that extends to its head. There is also extensive white ocellation on the sepia wings and upperback. The legs of both sexes have multiple metatarsal spurs, which give rise to the specific name. The female has chestnut underparts and a plain brown back and wings. She is more prominently crested than the male. Sri Lanka spurfowl is a seasonally terrestrial species, like most of its near relatives. It scratches vigorously amongst the leaf litter of the forest floor for invertebrates, especially mollusks and insects. It will also take various seeds, fallen fruit and spiders.

It was situated between Custom House (now a Docklands Light Railway station) and , the eastern terminus of the line. Silvertown was opened in 1863 by the Great Eastern Railway, on the route of the former Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway, with two tracks and platforms. A decline in use of the line led to the removal of one of the two tracks in 1980, leaving just one platform to serve trains in both directions. North Woolwich was also reduced to one platform. After third rail electrification of the line in 1986 by British Rail, services were increased and the single-track section became a bottleneck. Prior to closure, the typical Monday to Saturday service frequency westbound towards and eastbound towards North Woolwich was one train every 30 minutes during the daytime, increasing to one every 20 minutes in the evening; one train called every 30 minutes all day on Sundays. In 1973 a government report on the redevelopment of London's Docklands proposed an extension of the unbuilt Fleet line from Charing Cross via Fenchurch Street to Woolwich Arsenal, with stations on each side at Custom House and Woolwich Arsenal. The proposal was developed during the 1970s as the Fleet line developed into the Jubilee line. Although approved in 1980, financial constraints meant that the route was not proceeded with. By the start of the 1990s new plans had been developed to extend the Jubilee line on a route south of the River Thames towards Stratford. After London City Airport opened nearby there was an attempt to offer the station for connection to the airport, the station being renamed Silvertown and London City Airport on 4 October 1987, but the walk through adjacent side streets, and the relatively infrequent service, which was peripheral rather than into central London, led to little usage of the airport interchange. The Docklands Light Railway Woolwich Arsenal branch now provides a substitute service for much of this part of the NLL; the nearest DLR station to the disused Silvertown station is London City Airport. The remaining station buildings and platforms were demolished in 2012 as part of the construction of Crossrail, by Vinci, the contractor responsible for the reconditioning of the Connaught tunnel. Despite talk of constructing a replacement station nearby, this has not been provided for in the Crossrail Act 2008. Nevertheless, passive provision will be made for a station shortly to the east in the event of development of nearby properties.Silvertown Station - Crossrail Proposals - Crossrail Ltd. January 2012 Currently, there are proposals from London City Airport to fund the construction of a ¬£50 million Crossrail station so as to serve London City Airport.

Edward Stanley, (1 January 1779 ‚Äì 6 September 1849) was an English clergyman who served as Bishop of Norwich between 1837 and 1849. He set about combating laxity and want of discipline among the clergy. Early life Born in London into a notable Cheshire family, Stanley was the second son of Sir John Thomas Stanley FRSE, 6th Baronet of Alderley, and the younger brother of John Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley of Alderley. Educated at St John's College, Cambridge (16th wrangler, 1802), he was ordained in 1802 and three years later became rector of Alderley, Cheshire, a position he held for the next 32 years. While there he took a great interest in education, and encouraged especially the teaching of secular subjects at his school. Episcopal discipline In 1837 he was consecrated Bishop of Norwich and appointed Clerk of the Closet, holding both positions until his death. The diocese at this time was conspicuous for laxity and want of discipline, which he proceeded to remedy, although at first he met with much opposition. Ordinations and confirmations were held more regularly and frequently, schools were properly inspected, the Plurality Act, which prohibited the holding of more than one benefice by a clergyman except in certain cases, was enforced, and undesirable clergy were removed. Stanley showed tolerance towards Dissenters and supported all missionary undertakings, without regard for their sectarian associations. In politics he was a Liberal and devoted himself especially to educational questions. Other work Stanley's letters, Before and after Waterloo (edited by J. H. Adeane and M. Grenfell, 1907), are of interest to students of Napoleonic history. Bishop Stanley was the original Patron of the Ipswich Museum and presided at its opening in 1847. A portrait of him in oils is displayed there.R. A. D. Markham, A Rhino in High Street (Ipswich Borough Council 1991). From 1837 to 1849 he was President of the Linnean Society. Death and succession Edward Stanley died in 1849 and was buried in the nave of Norwich cathedral. He had married Catherine, eldest daughter of Oswald Leycester (another notable Cheshire family) in 1810. They had five children, including Owen Stanley, Arthur Penrhyn Stanley and Mary Stanley. He was succeeded by Samuel Hinds, a broad-churchman with strong associations with the Maoris of New Zealand, notably the Ngati Kuri and Te Patu tribes.

It is 24 km south-east of Nowra. Geography Situated alongside Currambene Creek which also serves as an anchorage and fishing port. Huskisson is a prime tourist destination owing to its white sands and emerald waters (although Hyams Beach to the south is known to have finer white sands).Gazing onto the world's whitest sand, SMH, 31 December 2005. The town is bounded by Currambene Creek in the north, Moona Moona Creek in the south, the Jervis Bay shoreline and its beaches in the east, and Jervis Bay National Park in the west. Etymology Huskisson was named by Governor Sir George Gipps, after the British statesman William Huskisson. Demographics At the , the population of the State Suburb of Huskisson was 786. 74.3% of people were born in Australia and 87.9% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 34.0%, Anglican 24.7% and Catholic 17.7%. History = Aboriginal History = The traditional owners of the area around Huskisson were a group of the Yuin. Well into the C20th, members of what local settlers called 'the Jervis Bay tribe' lived on the bank of Currambene Creek. The 'Jervis Bay tribe' are also known as the Wandandian people, They spoke Dharamba, which was probably the northernmost dialect of the Dhurga language. Huskisson lay very close to the linquistic boundary between the Dharamba dialect and the Thurawal language and the southern end of the traditional lands of the Thurawal people. = Origin of Huskisson = The origin of Huskisson dates to the early 1840s. The land south of Moona Moona Creek‚Äînow Vincentia‚Äîwas the site of the settlement of South Huskisson, founded in 1841 as a seaport and terminus of The Wool Road. South Huskisson lay on land originally owned by Edward Deas Thompson and was a ‚Äòprivate town‚Äô. The land to the north of Moona Moona Creek was a ‚Äògovernment reserve‚Äù. When South Huskisson was planned, it was envisaged that the land north of Moona Moona Creek would become a ‚Äògovernment township‚Äô. Allotments were sold both in South Huskisson (in 1841) and in the new 'government township' of Huskisson (in Feb.1843). South Huskisson was not a success and was in rapid decline by 1850. Consequently, the 'government township' of Huskisson failed to develop. By the mid-1850s, town allotments in both Huskisson and South Huskisson were essentially worthless. Huskisson only began to grow, when it became the site of shipbuilding in the early 1860s. In its early years, Huskisson was often referred to as ‚ÄòNorth Huskisson‚Äô reverting to Huskisson, once the ruins of its privately-owned southern twin town‚Äîby then referred to as ‚Äòthe Old Township‚Äô‚Äîhad all but disappeared. = Shipbuilding = From 1864 to 1977, at least 131 registered wooden-hulled vessels were built in Huskisson, in shipyards along Currumbene Creek. That number does not include the many unregistered wooden-hulled vessels‚Äîsuch as small boats, punts, barges, and timber lighters‚Äîthat were also built there during that period. The shipyards built sailing vessels and steamships, including schooners, tug-boats, island-trading ships‚Äîfor the firm of W.R. Carpenter & Co., during the 1930s and 1940s‚Äîand two passenger ferries for Sydney (Lady Denman in 1911 and Lady Scott in 1914). Up to the late 1940s, vessels were built using the ‚Äòwork frame‚Äô method in which frames were created using timber from natural crooks in trees (not bent using steam as is more common now). Until 1940, the town had no electricity; all vessels were built without power tools, other than a steam-operated saw-mill used to make planks. Timber was locally sourced, generally from within a few miles of the town. During the Second World War, the Huskisson shipyard built four wooden-hulled vessels for the American Army, for use in the New Guinea campaign. After the war, the old shipbuilding techniques gave way to more modern methods and in later years most vessels built were wooden-hulled fishing trawlers. The main shipyard owners were, in earlier years, the Dent family, and later the Setree family. = Services & Facilities = During the early days of the settlement, a post office operated at 'Huskisson', from January 1843 up to the end of December 1855. A post office opened in Huskisson in November 1875. By 1875, the ‚ÄòNorth Huskisson‚Äô school was in operation. A telephone exchange opened in November 1912. In 1940, the town was connected to electricity. There was a ‚ÄòGovernment Wharf used by the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company. = Tourism = By the 1890s, Huskisson began to be a holiday destination.

He is perhaps best remembered as being a rival of Cecil Rhodes. Early life Barney Barnato claimed he had the same birthday as Cecil Rhodes (5 July 1853). Most biographies give his date of birth as 5 July 1852. However, his birth certificate (supported by census data) shows he was born Barnet Isaacs in Aldgate, London on 21 February 1851, the son of Isaac and Leah Isaacs. He was educated by Moses Angel at the Jews' Free School. He had a hard life, and is reputed to have begged pass-outs from theatre-leavers at the Garrick Theatre in Leman Street, to sell them on to others for a halfpenny.\\"Rhodes and Barnato\\" in Ian D. Colvin (1913). Cecil John Rhodes 1853‚Äì1902. London: T.C. & E.C. Jack. Accessed 4 March 2007. For a while he became a prizefighter and music-hall turn.Stephen Inwood (2005). City of cities: The birth of modern London. London: Pan Books. p. 33. Barney grew up in Whitechapel, the very poor East End of London in an area that was predominantly a Jewish neighborhood. The Isaacs family lived in the area for nearly one hundred years. Isaac Isaacs, Barney's father, made a living from selling second hand clothing and fabric remnants. When Barney and his older brother Harry reached fourteen, they left school and entered the business. Their mother Leah died in the year after Barney was born, almost certainly following the birth of Barney's sister Elizabeth. Kate the oldest of the siblings, helped bring up the boys and two sisters Sarah and Lizzie. When they were in their teens, Barney and Harry liked to perform on stage in the Music Halls of the area, of which there were many. For the longest time Harry was introduced as the Great Henry Isaacs. Barney was added as ‚Äúand Barnett too‚Äù so he suggested to Harry that they call themselves Bar-na-to, the Barnato Brothers. From that time onwards, they were known by that name on the Music Hall stages. Barney had a talent for boxing. In his day, the Marquess of Queensberry Rules were rarely used in his amateur boxing bouts. Winning was all that mattered. He made money from his bouts, mainly by placing bets with the bookies. He was not scared of anyone. The bigger they came, the better he liked it. Career In 1873, Barney joined his brother Harry in the Cape Colony during the diamond rush which accompanied the discovery of diamonds at Kimberley. His brother had gone out in 1871. Barney saved up enough money to pay for his steerage passage. He left England and when he arrived in South Africa, he could not afford the coach to get to where the diamonds had been found. He ended up walking all the way with a bullock cart that was delivering supplies to the miners. It took him three months to walk there. Barney arrived in Kimberley to find that Harry was not doing very well. In fact he wasn't making money from diamonds at all, but from performances on stage and doing odd jobs. Barney spent his first year learning about diamonds, buying a stone here or there and selling at a small profit and then buying more. It was a slow process and one that frustrated him. He wanted his own claim, he wanted to dig his own stones out of the ground, not purchase each stone one by one. Barney had a good head for figures and was a fast learner. He was shrewd, always able to calculate the odds. Eventually, the opportunity to buy a claim came to Barney and Harry. In fact four adjacent claims were offered to them in Kimberley. The brothers barely had enough money to buy the claims, but somehow they managed to do it. =Barnato Diamond Mining Company= Spy in Vanity Fair, 1895 Barney conceived the idea of controlling the amount of diamonds entering the market. Keeping sales as close to demand as possible, or even less than demand. He postulated that it was possible to maintain diamond prices by stockpiling during the years when the world markets were down. As the markets moved upwards and demand increased, the stockpiles could be sold at higher prices. Of course it was necessary to gain control first. Overproduction was only one of the problems that all the diamond miners faced. Huge problems arose where adjacent claims were being mined at different rates and the levels. This was problematic because cave-ins became ever more frequent, especially where they were undercutting the adjacent claims. It was far worse in the summer when the rains came and flooded the lower levels, often drowning miners and burying equipment. Consolidation became Barney's goal. Cecil Rhodes, working the De Beers mine, had the same idea and became a major competitor in the race to consolidate. Initially there were more than 3,600 claims being mined at Kimberley. In time this number dropped to less than one hundred, and the Barnato Brothers were one of them. They used this name from the time Barney arrived in Kimberley, completely dropping the Isaacs name. As the Barnato Brothers made more money, they plowed it back into buying up more claims. Barney's goal and obsession was the complete consolidation of the Kimberley mine. There were plenty of other players with similar goals, so it was not an easy task to achieve. A ‚Äòbattle royal‚Äô ensued between Barney and Cecil Rhodes. The French Rothschild Bank was involved with Rhodes, as were a number of other wealthy men. All were experienced. All wanted control of the diamond mining interests of either Kimberley or De Beers. De Beers mine was the first to be consolidated‚Äînot by Barney, but by Rhodes, much to Barney's ire. A French mining company, Compagnie Fran√ßaise des Mines de Diamants du Cap de Bonne Esp√©rance, held a large block of claims that split Kimberley mine in two. A wealthy Parisian diamond dealer, a Mr. Jules Porges, owned this company. Rhodes managed to secure substantial backing from Rothschild Bank to purchase this French Company. Barney got wind of the sale and telegraphed Porges asking for an opportunity to bid if a sale were imminent. Rhodes bid ¬£1,400,000 to buy the company. Barney topped the offer by bidding ¬£1,750,000. Before getting a response from Porges, Rhodes telegraphed Barney and asked him to withdraw his offer. In return, Rhodes made Barney a tempting offer, one that he could not refuse. In return for withdrawing the offer, Rhodes would buy the French Company at his original bid price and sell it to Barney for ¬£300,000 plus a twenty per cent holding in the Barnato's Kimberley Central Diamond Mining Company. There is no doubt that this must have been a difficult decision to make. It would give him what he obsessed about, the control of the Kimberley Mine, enabling him to convert it to underground mining. The dilemma was that he was giving up a large part of his company to a rival. They may have been competitors, but Rhodes and Barney actually liked each other and got on well, even though they came from diverse backgrounds and upbringing. After several days consideration, Barney agreed to withdraw his offer and a month later the French Company was in his hands. Rhodes undoubtedly calculated the odds well. He and his partners had been buying up shares in the open market in Kimberley Central DMC and may well have had ten to fifteen per cent of the shares at the time of the sale of the French Company. With the extra twenty per cent, they were well on their way to gaining control of Kimberley Central DMC. Barney tried to keep control of his own company, but Rhodes outsmarted him, finally gaining control of Kimberley Central DMC a few months later. The upside was that shares in Kimberlery Central DMC rose from ¬£14 to ¬£49 each because of the competition from both camps. The downside was that it was higher diamond production that was fueling the buying spree. Resulting in diamond prices hitting an all-time low. Rhodes proposed that they merge the De Beers DMC into Kimberley Central DMC, forming one new consolidated company; De Beers Consolidated Mines. The merger made sense, even though they both knew that the merger would upset some of the shareholders. Barney emerged as the largest shareholder with 6,658 shares in the new company. Not all the investors were happy with this situation. A group of shareholders from Kimberley Central applied in the Supreme Court of the Cape to stop the merger. The judge ruled in favor of the applicants. The result was that Kimberley Central was liquidated and the De Beers Consolidated purchased the company. The Barnato Brothers shares ultimately were bought out for the astronomical sum of ¬£5,338,650 in 1889. As part of their control of all diamond mining in the Cape Colony, De Beers Consolidated purchased two other mines in the area, Bultfontein and Du Toitspan. The yield on the latter was poor, but the quality of the diamonds found there was far superior to all the other mines. It was a gamble that underground mining could eventually make both of these mines productive. Neither one of these was showing a return on investment, but they could not be allowed to pass into the hands of a competing company which might mean that at some point, they could undermine the prices, undoing the efforts made to stabilize prices. The most important thing that the merger produced was the 95% control of worldwide diamond production. Both Barney and Rhodes were in full agreement on this. The purchase cheque, signed by Rhodes, is said to have been the largest such instrument ever presented for payment up to that time. Barnato subsequently became Kimberley's member of parliament in the Cape Parliament from 1889 until his death. Rhodes and Barney planned to reduce the number of buyers for the rough diamonds to ten companies who would in turn sell to the diamond cutters and set up lines of distribution throughout the World. De Beers Consolidated duly carried out this plan and the ten companies became known as the syndicate. The syndicate included Barnato Brothers in London. Only these ten companies could buy production from De Beers Consolidated Mines. Diamond prices leveled off and finally increased steadily in value. Regardless of production levels, supply was kept on or close to demand. Barney turned his attention to the newly discovered gold area of the Witwatersrand or Rand as it became known. Gold in quartz is extremely difficult to separate. It was not like alluvial gold that can be panned in water. It took a great deal of machinery and was costly. This was money that most miners did not have. The wealthy diamond dealers and owners of Kimberley understood what it would take. They were prepared to make the investment that was needed and went to the Rand where they bought up the most promising claims. At the time of the initial discovery, Barney did not want to detract from his plan to take control of Kimberley Mine and rejected Harry and Woolf's urging to invest in gold mining. By 1888, after the consolidation of diamond mining had taken place, the Barnatos were late in coming to the mining town being called Johannesburg. Their big advantage was their coffers were full. And so began the start of a dozen gold mining companies floated on both the London Stock Exchange and the new Johannesburg exchange. These mining shares were given the nickname ‚Äòkaffirs.‚Äô Gold did not fluctuate, as did the price of diamonds, it was possible to calculate the exact amount of profit that could be made from a gold mine. The Bank of England backed its currency using a gold standard. The Americans were about to introduce a gold standard for their currency having had a silver standard for many years. Every ounce of gold that was mined could be sold to one government or another at a set price. Two doctors, MacArthur and Forrest, invented a new process for extracting gold from the ore using cyanide. It was possible to extract ninety-six per cent of the gold from the ore, using this process. Barney ordered the necessary equipment to be shipped from England to set up a cyanide plant for each of his mines. Investing in the Rand became the Barnatos highest priority. With the help of nephews Woolf and Solly, Barney went on a buying spree spending more than a million pounds in one year. Additionally, he invested in all manner of infrastructure that he knew would be needed for the future growth of Johannesburg. He purchased land in the new town to build offices, shops and market stalls, including a new stock exchange. Recognizing the need for somewhere to live in town, Barney purchased a farm in the Doornfontein section and completed the construction of a large house on Saratoga Avenue in a new exclusive suburb. Anything and everything that was needed to stimulate the growth of Johannesburg, was considered. Early in 1889, Barney floated his first gold mining company on the London and Johannesburg stock exchanges. The New Primrose Gold Mining Company was a combination of a number of claims he had purchased on two adjacent properties. At the same time he floated the Johannesburg Estate Company, which had nothing directly to do with gold mining, only real estate and peripheral businesses in the town. After the formation of his Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company that year, he went on a major acquisition plan and invested in multiple businesses; building materials, transport, food wagons and liquor. Barnato doubled his fortune in the boom in South African gold mining shares of 1894‚Äì95 before losing most of it in the 1896 share collapse. He built, but never lived in, a vast house on the corner of Park Lane and Stanhope Gate in Mayfair, London, which was bought after his death by the banker Sir Edward Sassoon. Personal life Barney married Fanny Christina Bees. Together they had 3 children: *Leah \\"Lily\\" Primrose Barnato (1893-1933) *Isaac \\"Jack\\" Henry Woolf Barnato (c.1894-1918) *Woolf \\"Babe\\" Barnato (1895-1948) He was also the father of Isabel Louisa Barnato (born 5 June 1891,General Record Office Births Jun 1891 Barnato, Isabel Louisa B, Christchurch, 2b 679 died 19 June 1891General Record Office Deaths Jun 1891 Barnato, Isabel Louisa B, 0, Christchurch, 2b 483), daughter of Isabella Barnato (born Isabella Clarke 30 November 1865, died 30 October 1891General Record Office Deaths Dec 1891 Barnato, Isabella, 25, Christchurch, 2b 422). =Death= Barnato died in 1897 in mysterious circumstances; records state that he was lost overboard near the island of Madeira, whilst on a passage home to England.Who do you think you are? ‚Äî Esther Rantzen on BBC.co.uk. Accessed 3 September 2008. Although some have wondered if this was suicide and suggested that the Jameson Raid had had a major impact on him and left him severely depressed, his family vigorously rejected that theory, saying that it was totally out of character for a man who had been a pioneer in the rough-and-ready days of emerging Southern Africa. His body was recovered from the sea and he was buried at Willesden Jewish Cemetery in London. The theory regarding the suicide of Barnato has also been tied to sinister later events. One of his heirs, Woolf Joel was shot and killed in his business offices in Johannesburg by a con-man named Karl Frederick Kurtze who went away with the name of Ludwig von Veltheim in 1898. In the trial for murder, von Veltheim hinted that he was supposed to be orchestrating a plot to kidnap Paul Kruger, President of the Transvaal Boer Republic, that Barnato and Joel were backing. The murder stemmed from blackmail against Joel, but von Veltheim claimed he was only seeking his promised payment. As a result, von Veltheim was able to get an acquittal from a Boer Jury (possibly due to anti- British and anti-Semitic feelings towards the deceased). It was suggested by Brian Roberts, in his book The Diamond Magnates, that Barnato may have been approached by von Veltheim too, and unsettled by his physical threats and the possibility of exposure.Brian Roberts, The Diamond Magnates. London: Hamilton, 1972. pp. 232‚Äì244. His will divided up his considerable fortune between his family, amongst which was his sister Sarah and her husband Abraham Rantzen, great-grandparents of TV presenter Esther Rantzen. Another beneficiary was his son, Woolf Barnato, who used part of the multimillion-pound fortune he inherited at the age of two, to become a pioneer racing driver in the 1920s, one of the so-called Bentley Boys. =Descendants= Barnato's granddaughter Diana Barnato Walker died in 2008 at the age of 90.

He took two others with Skagul Toste and Cnut the Great. Storm in Hj√∏rungav√•g by Gerhard Munthe Thorkell the Tall, also known as Thorkell the High in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (Old Norse: √ûorke(ti)ll inn h√°vi; ; Swedish: Torkel H√∂ge; ), was a prominent member of the Jomsviking order and a notable lord. He was a son of the Scanian chieftain Strut-Harald, and a brother of Jarl Sigvaldi, Hemingr and T√≥fa. Thorkell was the chief commander of the Jomvikings and the legendary stronghold Jomsborg, on the Island of Wollin. He is also credited as having received the young Cnut the Great into his care and taken Cnut on raids. The Encomium Emmae, a document aimed at the movers and shakers of the Anglo-Scandinavian court in the early 1040s, describes Thorkell as a great war leader and warrior. Thorkell notably partook in a campaign that saw him lead a great Viking army to Kent in 1009, where they proceeded to overrun most of Southern England. This soon culminated in the Siege of Canterbury in 1011 and the kidnapping of archbishop √Ülfheah, who had previously converted Olaf Tryggvason, and his subsequent murder at Greenwich on 19 April 1012. Biography Thorkell is a historical figure, but his career, especially its early part, is steeped in associations with the legendary Jomsvikings. Thorkell took part in the Battle of Hj√∂rungav√°gr in 986 and in the Battle of Swold in 1000. In August 1009, a large Danish army led by Thorkell the Tall landed on the shores of Sandwich. They first marched towards the city of Canterbury but were promptly paid 3000 pounds of silver by the people of Kent to sway the army from attacking.The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle They instead turned towards London and attempted to take the city several times, but were met with heavy resistance and ultimately abandoned their attack. On 8 September 1011 the Viking army returned to Canterbury and besieged the city for three weeks, eventually taking it through the treachery of a man named √Ülfmaer, whose life had been previously saved by the archbishop of Canterbury, √Ülfheah. Thorkell and his men occupied Canterbury and took several hostages of importance, including √Ülfheah himself, who was held prisoner for seven months. During the captivity, √Ülfheah seems to have taken the opportunity to convert as many of the Vikings as possible to Christianity prompting tension. The Vikings demanded an extra 3000 pounds of silver for the release of the archbishop, but √Ülfheah bravely refused to be ransomed or have his people pay the invaders. As a consequence, √Ülfheah was murdered by Thorkell's men during a drunken feast at Greenwich on 19 April 1012 - the Vikings pelted him with the bones of cattle before one Viking finished him off with a blow to the back of the head with the butt of an axe. Thorkell was said to have tried his best to prevent the death of the archbishop, offering the attackers everything he possessed to stop the killing, save for his ship. And someone, possibly Thorkell, is said to have carried the corpse to London the day after the murder. Thorkell's army eventually ceased their attacks across Southern England, but only after a large series of danegeld payments were made, eventually culminating to 48,000 pounds of silver. Disillusioned by the archbishop's murder, and sensing that he was losing control over his men, Thorkell and several other loyalists defected, taking 45 Viking ships with them. He and his men subsequently entered into the service of the English King √Üthelred the Unready as mercenaries, of whom they fought under in 1013 against the invasion of Danish King Sweyn Forkbeard and his son Cnut.Howard, Ian, Swein Forkbeard's Invasions and the Danish Conquest of England, 991‚Äì1017, Boydell & Brewer (2003), pg. 44 After the death of Edmund Ironside on 30 November 1016, Cnut became king of England and he divided the country into four earldoms - making Thorkell the jarl of East Anglia. It is unknown how Thorkell fell into Cnut's services, especially considering the former's role in opposing Cnut and his father's invasion of England in 1013, but it is assumed that Cnut considered him a valuable asset and powerful ally. Given the Jomsvikings' role in political events in Scandinavia, the possibility exists that Thorkell played a masterminding role in assisting with Sveyn Forkbeard's 1013 invasion and Cnut's re-invasion a few years later. In 1021, for unknown reasons, Thorkell is very briefly described as falling out with Cnut, with the former being banished by the king and returning to Denmark. However, Cnut later reconciled with Thorkell in 1023, seemingly aware of the strong connections and influence he had in his home country and that he was too powerful a man to be made an enemy of. As a result, he was granted the earldom of Denmark and given custody of Cnut's son Harthacnut, to whom Thorkell would serve as foster-father. Thorkell's rule was a short one, with Cnut's brother- in-law Ulf the Earl to become Jarl of Denmark a year later. The perceived power vacuum of Thorkell's unexplained absence after 1023 and the commitment of Cnut in England, prompted King Olaf II of Norway and King Anund Jacob of Sweden to launch attacks on the Danish in the Baltic Sea. The Swedish and Norwegian navies led by kings Anund Jacob and Olaf II lay in wait up the river for the navy of King Cnut, which was commanded by Danish earl Ulf Jarl. Now known as the Battle of Helge√•, the decisive victory left Cnut the dominant leader in Scandinavia. There is no mention of Thorkell after 1023, and he seems to have disappeared from the historical record,. Maybe he was cast out of the kingdom to return to Jomsborg or Scania. Alternatively, he may have died soon after he was made Jarl of Denmark, presumably in 1024. One theory is that he was chased down by an angry mob, another that he was simply too old for any more conflict; the Jomsvikings were known to have men serving in the fighting ranks of age 18 to 50. With no military commands, the final years of his life could have been spent at court or on his estates. He may have died in battle in 1039, a year before his foster son Harthacnut joined Emma of Normandy in Bruges prior to travelling to England and claiming the throne. Thorkell, celebrated in his life time by the poets, appears in the Jomsvikinga Saga and on Runestones for his exploits. Thorkell's proven shrewd nature and wisdom were well documented. The sometimes contradictory contemporary literature of the Encomium Emmae has Thorkell as being in service of, rather than the threat to, Cnut and Harthacnut's authority. It is known one of Thorkell's sons was a prominent member of Harthacnut's retinue; after the collapse and subsequent death of Harthacnut at the wedding feast of Tovi the Proud in 1042, Thorkell's wife and two sons were expelled from England. This was possibly linked to the intrigue that surrounded Magnus the Good's letter of intention to invade the realm of Edward the Confessor, with the ambition to reunite the kingdoms of what is now described as the North Sea Empire.

During the whole series of this episodic journey Mr. Zero is surprisingly oblivious to his deepest needs, wants and desires. The story focuses on Mr. Zero, an accountant at a large, faceless company. After 25 years at his job, he discovers that he will be replaced by an adding machine. In anger and pain, he snaps and kills his boss. Mr. Zero is then tried for murder, is found guilty and hanged.

The play ends with Zero following a very attractive girl named Hope off stage. The play was an influence on the Tennessee Williams play Stairs to the Roof. Years later, it was adapted into a 1969 film of the same name, written and directed by Jerome Epstein and starring Milo O'Shea, Phyllis Diller, Billie Whitelaw and Sydney Chaplin.

The collection was established in May 1998, and until 2008 was housed in Old Parliament House and in a nearby gallery on Commonwealth Place. On 4 December 2008, its purpose-built permanent home was opened on King Edward Terrace, Canberra ‚Äì beside the High Court of Australia ‚Äì by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd.  History  In the early 1900s, the painter Tom Roberts was the first to propose that Australia should have a national portrait gallery, but it was not until the 1990s that the possibility began to take shape. The 1992 exhibition Uncommon Australians ‚Äì developed by the Gallery's founding patrons, Gordon and Marilyn Darling ‚Äì was shown in Canberra and toured to four state galleries, igniting the idea of a national portrait gallery. In 1994, under the management of the National Library of Australia, the Gallery's first exhibition was launched in Old Parliament House. It was a further four years before the appointment of Andrew Sayers as inaugural Director signalled the establishment of the National Portrait Gallery as an institution in its own right, with a board, a budget and a brief to develop its own collection. The opening of displays in the refurbished Parliamentary Library and two adjacent wings of Old Parliament House in 1999 endorsed the Gallery's status and arrival as an independent institution. While the spaces of Old Parliament House proved adaptable to the National Portrait Gallery's programs, its growing profile and collection necessitated the move to a dedicated building. Funding for the $87 million building was provided in the 2005 Federal Budget and Sydney-based architectural firm Johnson Pilton Walker was awarded the job of creating the Gallery, with construction commencing in December 2006. The new National Portrait Gallery opened to the public on 4 December 2008.  The building  The western face of the National Portrait Gallery building Won through an open international design competition by Johnson Pilton Walker in 2005, the building provides exhibition space for approximately 500 portraits in a simple configuration of day-lit galleries. The external form of the building responds to its site by using the building‚Äôs geometry to connect with key vistas and alignments around the precinct. A series of five bays, each more than long, are arranged perpendicular to the Land Axis referring to Walter Burley Griffin‚Äôs early concepts for the National Capital. The National Portrait Gallery features a sequence of spaces leading from the Entrance Court defined by the two large cantilever concrete blades on the eastern side of the building, through the foyer to the fantastic gallery spaces. Each gallery receives controlled natural light from translucent glazed clerestory windows and views to the outside. In April 2019, the Gallery was closed for several months for rectification work to maintain the integrity of its building. The Gallery reopened in September 2019.  The permanent collection  In 2020, the National Portrait Gallery‚Äôs permanent collection stands at approximately 3000 portraits across a range of mediums ‚Äì including photography, painting, drawing, multimedia, sculpture and textiles ‚Äì and continues to grow through an acquisition and commissioning program tied to a judiciously applied collection criteria.  The National Portrait Prizes  The Gallery‚Äôs National Photographic Portrait Prize (NPPP) is a highlight of the Australian arts calendar. Judges select 40 to 50 finalists from thousands of entries from across the nation, with these comprising the annual NPPP exhibition. 2020 also sees the arrival of the inaugural Darling Portrait Prize for painted portraits, featuring a AUD$75,000 winner‚Äôs prize. The Darling Prize exhibition‚Äôs March opening means it joins the NPPP in the Gallery‚Äôs autumn calendar, with the two exhibitions presented in tandem as the Gallery‚Äôs inaugural ‚ÄòNational Portrait Prizes‚Äô. The inaugural prize was awarded to Anthea da Silva for her portrait of dancer and choreographer Elizabeth Cameron Dalman.

On June 2, 1995, he was shot down over Bosnia and Herzegovina by an 2K12 Kub mobile SAM launcher and forced to eject from his F-16C into hostile territory. Marines from the U.S. eventually rescued O'Grady after nearly a week of him evading the Bosnian Serbs. He was previously involved in the Banja Luka incident where he fired upon six enemy aircraft. The 2001 film Behind Enemy Lines is loosely based upon his experiences. In September 2011, O'Grady announced a run for the 2012 Republican nomination for Texas State Senate District 8, held at the time by the retiring Republican Florence Shapiro, but he later suspended his campaign because of uncertainties over the Texas redistricting fight.O'Grady suspends bid for Collin County seat in Texas Senate. Trail Blazers Blog for the Dallas Morning News. January 30, 2012. Career =NATO: Operation Deny Flight= The Bosnian War was an international armed conflict that took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina between April 1992 and December 1995. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), after popular pressure, had decided to intervene in the Bosnian War after allegations of war crimes against civilians were made by various media organizations. NATO military involvement primarily involved enforcement of a no fly Zone codenamed Operation Deny Flight to discourage Bosnian Serb military aircraft from attacking Bosnian civilians and Bosniak and Croat forces. As part of that operation, two F-16s from the 555th Fighter Squadron based at Aviano Air Base, Italy, were patrolling the skies above Bosnia on June 2, 1995. Shootdown On the ground, a Bosnian-Serb army 2K12 Kub surface-to-air missile battery near Mrkonjiƒá Grad was readying to fire its missiles on NATO aircraft. The Serbs had moved the mobile tracked missile battery and laid a trap. They switched on their missile radars sparingly, giving F-16 fighters little warning. Waiting until a plane was directly overhead, where the aircraft's warning and countermeasures would be at their weakest, they fired two missiles. In the cockpit, O'Grady's instruments alerted him that a missile was coming but, because he was flying through an overcast sky, he could not see it. The first missile exploded between the two aircraft. The second struck the F-16 piloted by O'Grady. His flight lead, Captain Robert Gordon \\"Wilbur\\" Wright, saw O'Grady's plane burst into flames and break in two. Wright did not see a parachute, but O'Grady survived by ejecting from the aircraft. O'Grady landed among a Bosnian-Serb population he was briefed would be unfriendly. He quickly secured a survival bag, ran, and hid. Rubbing dirt on his face, he hid face-down as Bosnian-Serb forces came upon his parachute, half a dozen times shooting their rifles only feet from where he was hidden in an effort to flush him out or kill him. F-16C of the 555th Fighter Squadron based at Aviano Air Base, Italy. During the next six days, he put to use the lessons learned during a 17-day Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape (SERE) training session he had undertaken near his hometown of Spokane, Washington. He ate leaves, grass, and bugs, and stored the little rainwater he could collect with a sponge in plastic bags. O'Grady radioed for help immediately but had to remain quiet with paramilitaries coming within feet of him; he used the radio following standard operating procedures as the U.S. Air Force had taught him so not to give away his position to unfriendly forces. On his 6th night on the ground he made radio contact, signalling his location using his radio's limited battery power. NATO planes conducting sorties in the Balkans had been picking up beeper snippets that they thought could be coming from O'Grady. This extremely sensitive information was inadvertently revealed by General Ronald Fogleman, the Air Force Chief of Staff, when the general told reporters attending a promotion ceremony that monitors had detected \\"intermittent\\" transmissions. A NATO official was quoted as saying \\"I was dumbfounded he said that... I mean, why not just announce to the bad guys, 'We think he's alive and kicking, and we hope we find him before you do'?\\" Rescue Just after midnight on June 8, O'Grady spoke into the radio. An F-16 pilot, Captain Thomas \\"T.O.\\" Hanford, from the 510th responded and, after confirming his identity, the rescue was set in motion. At 0440 local time, Admiral Leighton Smith, commander of NATO Southern Forces, called US Marine Corps Colonel Martin Berndt aboard USS Kearsarge with orders to \\"execute\\". Two CH-53 Sea Stallions with 51 marines from the 3rd Battalion, 8th Marines within the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit lifted off USS Kearsarge to rescue the pilot. The two helicopters were accompanied by two Marine Corps AH-1W Supercobra helicopter gunships and a pair of Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier jump jets. These six aircraft had support from identical sets of replacement helicopters and jump jets as well as two Navy EA-6B Prowler electronic warfare planes, two Air Force EF-111A Raven electronic warfare planes, two Marine F/A-18D Hornets, a pair of anti-tank Air Force A-10 Thunderbolts, an SH-60B from USS Ticonderoga (CG-47), and a NATO AWACS radar plane. At 0635, the helicopters approached the area where O'Grady's signal beacon had been traced. The pilots saw bright yellow smoke coming from trees near a rocky pasture where O'Grady had set off a flare. The first Sea Stallion, commanded by Major William Tarbutton, touched down and 20 Marines jumped off the aircraft and set up a defensive perimeter. As the second Sea Stallion (It was commanded by Captains Paul Fortunato and James Wright) landed, a figure with a pistol who turned out to be the missing pilot appeared running towards the Marines and immediately went to the Sea Stallion. As the side door opened, he was pulled in before the second 20 Marines poised to leave by the rear ramp could even move. They were called back to their seats, and those who had formed the defensive perimeter reboarded the other helicopter. After a quick head count, the Stallions took off. They had been on the ground no more than seven minutes. Return The Marines, with O'Grady, flew low over Serb-held Bosnia. However, American aircraft detected a Serb missile radar along the Croatian coast, scanning for targets. An American plane recommended destroying the Serb radar, code-named Giraffe. The request was denied, partly out of concern that a strike could spark wider conflict. Minutes later, the Marines reported they were under fire. Three shoulder- launched surface-to-air missiles had been fired at them but missed, as the helicopter pilots‚Äîflying off the ground at ‚Äîjinked to evade them. Serb small arms pocked both helicopters; the Marines aboard heard the bullets hit inside the fuselage. One door gunner returned fire. One round hit some communication gear in the chopper and the bullet ended up against Master Sergeant Angel Castro Jr.'s armor without injuring anyone. At 0715 local time, 30 minutes after picking up O'Grady, the rescuers reported \\"feet wet\\", meaning they were over water. O'Grady was back aboard the Kearsarge at 0730. All of the aircraft landed without further incident.

O'Grady and Mary Lou Scardapane, and graduated from Lewis and Clark High School in Spokane, Washington. He is a former cadet in the Civil Air Patrol and a 1989 Air Force ROTC graduate from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University's campus in Prescott, Arizona. After his rescue, O'Grady transferred from active duty in the regular U.S. Air Force to the Air Force Reserve, where he continued to fly the F-16. In May 2007, he completed a master's degree in biblical studies at Dallas Theological Seminary in Dallas, Texas. He resides in Frisco in Collin County, Texas. O'Grady is an active Republican, having spoken at the 1996 Republican convention in support of Bob Dole.Convention Notes (Monday night). CNN. August 12, 1996. In 2004, O'Grady, supporting George W. Bush for re-election, accused Bush's opponent John Kerry of \\"treason\\" for actions taken during the Vietnam War.O'Grady: Kerry's actions after Vietnam constituted treason. Associated Press (via Minnesota Public Radio). August 13, 2004. O'Grady endorsed Brian Birdwell in his successful 2010 bid for the Texas State Senate, then launched his own candidacy for the Texas state house in September 2011, seeking the 2012 Republican nomination in Senate District 8 following the retirement of Sen. Florence Shapiro. O'Grady dropped out of the race in early 2012, claiming Shapiro had reneged on a promise to support him in the Republican primary, while his opponent had numerous endorsements.In Senate race, Scott O'Grady details split with Florence Shapiro. Trail Blazers Blog for the Dallas Morning News. February 2, 2012. In popular culture The shootdown incident was depicted and described on the documentary television program Situation Critical in episode No. 5, \\"Downed Pilot\\". This has been shown on the National Geographic Channel. It was also covered in \\"Escape! ‚Äì Escape From Bosnia: The Scott O'Grady Story\\" on the History Channel. The BBC also made a documentary, titled \\"Missing in Action\\", that was later purchased by 20th Century Fox and Discovery Communications. The 2001 film Behind Enemy Lines, starring Gene Hackman and Owen Wilson, is loosely based on this event. Although O'Grady had given the film a positive rating on the film review television show Hot Or Not, O'Grady took offense at the portrayal of 'his' character in Behind Enemy Lines \\"as a pilot who disobeys orders and swears\\". O'Grady sued 20th Century Fox in 2002 for falsely misleading the public that the film was true to life and for using him unauthorized to promote the film without his permission. He also took action over the documentary, Behind Enemy Lines: The Scott O'Grady Story, which was a re-edited version of a BBC documentary which Discovery Communications, parent company of the Discovery Channel, had purchased and edited. The documentary was broadcast several times on the Discovery Channel, and O'Grady accused Fox of using it to promote the film. Both suits were settled in 2004. Fox made a confidential settlement with O'Grady, while a Texas court ruled against O'Grady and in favor of Discovery Communications. The judge's ruling stated, in effect, that the events in a person's life are not the same thing as that person's likeness or image. O'Grady co-wrote two books, collaborating on one, with Michael French, that detailed his experiences of being shot down over Bosnia and his eventual rescue, Basher Five-Two: The True Story of F-16 Fighter Pilot Captain Scott O'Grady. He first wrote a book that was a New York Times Bestseller about his experience in Return with Honor with Jeff Coplon. Another book has also been written; this one, \\"Good To Go:\\" The Rescue of Capt. Scott O'Grady, USAF, from Bosnia, was written by Mary Pat Kelly.

He is best known for his plays The Adding Machine (1923) and his Pulitzer Prize-winning drama of New York tenement life, Street Scene (1929). Biography =Early years= Rice was born Elmer Leopold Reizenstein at 127 East 90th Street in New York City, New York.Biographical information for this entry is taken from Durham, Palmieri, and Rice's autobiography. His grandfather was a political activist in the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states. After the failure of that political upheaval, he emigrated to the United States where he became a businessman. He spent most of his retirement years living with the Rice family and developed a close relationship with his grandson Elmer, who became a politically motivated writer and shared his grandfather's liberal and pacifist politics. A staunch atheist, his grandfather may also have influenced Elmer in his feelings about religion as he refused to attend Hebrew school or to have a bar mitzvah. In contrast, Rice's relationship with his father was very distant. As he wrote in his autobiography, his grandfather and his Uncle Will, both of whom boarded with the family, made up for the affection and attention his father withheld.Rice, p. 26. A child of the tenements, Rice spent much of his youth reading, to his family's consternation, and later observed, \\"Nothing in my life has been more helpful than the simple act of joining the library.\\"Rice, pp. 42, 62. Because of his need to support his family when his father's epilepsy worsened, Rice did not complete high school, and he took a number of menial jobs before earning his diploma by preparing for the state examinations on his own and then applying to law school. Though he disliked legal studies and spent a good deal of class time reading plays in class (because they could be finished within the span of a two-hour lecture, he said), Rice graduated from New York Law School in 1912 and began a short-lived legal career.Rice, p. 82. Leaving the profession in 1914, he was always to retain a cynical outlook about lawyers, but his two years in a law office provided him with material for several plays, most notably Counsellor-at-Law (1931). Courtroom dramas became a Rice specialty. Needing to make a living, he decided to try writing full-time. It was a wise decision. His first play, On Trial (1914), a melodramatic murder mystery, was a great success and ran for 365 performances in New York.Palmieri, pp. 34-35. George M. Cohan offered to buy the rights for $30,000, a proposition Rice declined largely because he did not believe Cohan could be serious. Co-authored with a friend, Frank Harris (not the famed Oscar Wilde biographer and memoirist), the play was purportedly the first American drama to employ the technique of reverse-chronology, telling the story from its conclusion to its starting-point. On Trial then went on tour throughout the United States with three separate companies and was produced in Argentina, Austria, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Norway, Scotland and South Africa. The author ultimately earned $100,000 from his first work for the stage.Rice, pp. 98-119. Rice aptly entitled this chapter of his memoirs \\"The Jackpot.\\" None of his later plays earned him as much as On Trial. The play was adapted for the cinema three times, in 1917, 1928, and 1939. Political and social issues occupied Rice's attention in this period as well. World War I and Woodrow Wilson's conservatism confirmed him in his criticism of the status quo. (He had been firmly converted to socialism in his teens, he said, by reading George Bernard Shaw, H.G. Wells, John Galsworthy, Maxim Gorky, Frank Norris, and Upton Sinclair.Rice, p. 137) He frequented Greenwich Village, then the most bohemian part of New York City, in the late 1910s and became friendly with many socially-conscious writers and activists, including the African-American poet James Weldon Johnson and the illustrator Art Young.Rice, pp. 158-160. =Career= From left, Joseph P. Bickerton, Jr. (theatre producer), Elmer Rice (playwright) and Carl Laemmle Jr. (Universal producer) sign a contract for the film version of Counsellor at Law After writing four more plays of no special distinction, Rice startled audiences in 1923 with his next contribution to the theatre, the boldly expressionistic The Adding Machine, which he wrote in 17 days.Durham, pp. 32-54. A satire about the growing regimentation of life in the machine age, the play tells the story the life, death and bizarre afterlife of a dull bookkeeper, Mr. Zero. When Mr. Zero, a mere cog in the corporate machine, discovers that he is to be replaced at work by an adding machine, he snaps and murders his boss. After his trial and execution, he enters the next life only to confront some of the same issues and, judged to be of minimal use in heaven, is sent back to Earth for recycling. Theatre critic Brooks Atkinson called it \\"the most original and brilliant play any American had written up to that time ... the harshest and most illuminating play about modern society [Broadway had ever seen].\\"Atkinson, p. 215. Dorothy Parker and Alexander Woollcott were enthusiastic. Other reviewers spoke of him, hyperbolically, as a writer who might become America's Ibsen.Marion Meade, Dorothy Parker: A Biography (New York: Villard, 1987), p. 123. Directed with great ingenuity by Philip Moeller, designed by Lee Simonson, and produced by the Theatre Guild, the play starred Dudley Digges and Edward G. Robinson, then at the start of his acting career.Atkinson, p. 216. Ironically, it made its author no money at all. (Adapted as an innovatively staged musical in 2007, The Adding Machine enjoyed a successful Off-Broadway run in 2008.) When Dorothy Parker was at work on her own play the following year (loosely based on fellow Algonquin Round Table member Robert Benchley, his marital problems, and the extra-marital temptations he was grappling with) and needed a co-author, she approached Elmer Rice, now acknowledged as the Broadway \\"boy wonder\\" of the moment. It was a smooth collaboration and also resulted in a brief affair between Parker and the already-married Rice, begun at Rice's insistent urging.Meade, pp. 124-125. The run of the play did not go smoothly, however; despite good reviews, Close Harmony (1924) closed quickly and was soon forgotten. Rice was a prolific, even tireless writer. His plays over the next five years included the unproduced The Sidewalks of New York (1925), Is He Guilty? (1927) and The Gay White Way (1928) and two collaborations, Wake Up, Jonathan (1928) with Hatcher Hughes, a dramatist unknown today and Cock Robin (1929) with Philip Barry, a Broadway name equal to Rice's. None of these plays were a success. Rice was a theatre professional by this time: open to collaboration, increasingly interested in producing and directing his own plays. In the 1930s, he even bought a Broadway house, the famed Belasco Theatre. Original Broadway production of Street Scene (1929) Rice's second hit (after The Adding Machine) proved to be his most lasting literary accomplishment. Originally entitled Landscape with Figures, Street Scene (1929), later the subject of an opera by Kurt Weill, won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for its realistic chronicle of life in the slums. \\"With fifty characters casually strolling through it,\\" Brooks Atkinson wrote, \\"it looked like an improvisation.... Based on the facade of a house at 25 West 65th Street, which Rice selected as typical, the tall massive setting caught the tone and humanity of a decaying brownstone.\\"Atkinson, p. 275. The script had been rejected by most producers who read it, and director George Cukor abandoned it as un-stageable after the second day of rehearsals. Rice took over the direction himself and proved that it was highly stageworthy, if unconventional in its narrative style and disorienting naturalism. Like The Adding Machine, the play's break with the conventions of stage realism was part of its appeal.Durham, pp. 57-68. Rice's plays of the 1930s included The Left Bank (1931), a comedy dramatizing an expatriate's superficial attempt to escape from American materialism in Paris, and Counsellor-at-Law (1931), a vigorous work that drew a realistic picture of the legal profession for which Rice had been trained. (The latter play is probably more frequently revived in regional theatres than any of Rice's other plays.) In that decade, he also wrote two novels and enjoyed a lucrative period in Hollywood, writing screenplays. His time in Hollywood was not without its friction, though, as he was looked upon by many studio heads as one of \\"those Eastern Reds.\\"Joseph McBride, Frank Capra: The Catastrophe of Success (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1992), p. 237. The Depression-inspired, anti-capitalist We, the People (1933) was a play particularly close to Rice's heart. It dealt with \\"the misfortunes of a typical skilled workman and his family, helplessly engulfed in the tide of national adversity,\\" as its author described it. Rice engaged an activist-minded cast and noted set designer Aline Bernstein to design the fifteen different sets that the ambitious play called for. We, the People failed amid what Rice called \\"agitated\\" reviews.Rice, pp. 328-329. A 1932 trip to the Soviet Union and to Germany, where he heard Hitler and Goebbels speak, provided material for Rice's next plays. The Reichstag fire trial is an element in Judgement Day (1934), and conflicting American and Soviet ideologies form the subject of the conversation-piece Between Two Worlds (1934). Maxwell Anderson, S. N. Behrman, Robert E. Sherwood and Elmer Rice, four of the five founders of the Playwrights' Company (1938) After the failure of these plays, Rice returned to Broadway in 1937 to write and direct for the Playwrights' Company, which he had helped to establish along with Maxwell Anderson, S. N. Behrman, Sidney Howard, and Robert E, Sherwood. Of his later plays, the most successful was the fantasy Dream Girl (1945) in which an over-imaginative girl encounters unexpected romance in reality. Rice's last play was Cue for Passion (1958), a modern psycho-analytical variation of the Hamlet theme in which Diana Wynyard played a Gertrude-like character. In his retirement, Rice was the author of a controversial book on American drama, The Living Theatre (1960), and of a richly detailed autobiography, Minority Report (1964). Rice was one of the more politically outspoken dramatists of his time and took an active part in the American Civil Liberties Union, the Authors' League, the Dramatists Guild of America where he was elected as the eighth president in 1939, and P.E.N. He was the first director of the New York office of the Federal Theatre Project, but resigned in 1936 to protest government censorship of the Project's \\"Living Newspaper\\" dramatization of Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia. An outspoken defender of free speech, he left that position with a \\"blast of scorn\\" at the Roosevelt administration's efforts to control artistic expression.Atkinson, p. 274. (In 1932, Rice had reluctantly supported the Communist Party candidate in the presidential election because he found Hoover and Roosevelt equally displeasing alternatives with an insufficient grasp of the crisis the country faced.Rice, p. 326. though in subsequent elections he became an FDR supporter) He also spoke out against McCarthyism in the 1950s. In the end, Elmer Rice did not believe he had been a success as a writer, not as he wished to define success.Rice, p. 236. He needed to make a living and, while deriding the commercialism of the New York stage, he managed to earn a considerable amount of money, but at a cost to his more experimental vision. The realistic drama he could write with ease was at odds with the innovations that most intrigued him. The Adding Machine and Street Scene were anomalies and did not make money. An even more radical venture, The Sidewalks of New York of 1925, was an episodic play without words, \\"in which speech is indicated by gesture, by a series of situations in which there was no need for speech.\\"Rice, p. 236 The Theatre Guild turned the script down flat; Broadway would never be ready for the level of experimentation that inspired Rice, a reality that was a source of continuous frustration for him. =Personal life= Rice was married in 1915 to Hazel Levy and had two children with her, Margaret and Robert. After his divorce in 1942, he married actress Betty Field with whom he had three children, John, Judy and Paul, before their divorce in 1956. Though born into a working-class family with no interest in the arts and known primarily for his attachment to theater and politics, Rice was also passionate about Old Master and modern art. His own art collection, slowly assembled over the years, included works by Picasso, Braque, Rouault, Leger, Derain, Klee, and Modigliani.Rice, pp. 267, 337. He regularly frequented New York's museums and in his autobiography wrote of his first trip to Spain and the powerful impact Velazquez had on him and, in Mexico, of enjoying the work of Diego Rivera and the Mexican Muralists, artists who shared his political bent.Rice, pp. 331-332. He was close friends with Japanese-American modernist painter Yasuo Kuniyoshi.Rice, p. 216. Elmer Rice lived for many years on a wooded estate in Stamford, Connecticut, until his death in Southampton, England, in 1967 of pneumonia after suffering a heart attack. https://www.jta.org/1967/05/10/archive/elmer-rice-noted-american-jewish- playwright-dies-in-london-was-74 Obituaries took note of a long and respected theater career. Brooks Atkinson described Rice in his history of Broadway as \\"a plain, rather sober man with a reticent, unyielding personality.... But when a social principle was at stake, he was more clear-headed than most people, and he was quietly invincible.... He was one of Broadway's most eminent citizens.\\"Atkinson, pp. 274. 276.  Archive  Elmer Rice's papers were placed at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin in 1968, a year after his death. Additions have been made by family members over the years. The collection spans over 100 boxes and includes contracts, correspondence, manuscript drafts, notebooks, photographs, royalty statements, scripts, theater programs, and over seventy-three scrapbooks. The Ransom Center's library division has over 900 books from Rice's personal library, many of which are personally inscribed to or annotated by Rice.

History In late June 1970, when the Brewers were still a new team and having difficulty drawing spectators to their games at Milwaukee County Stadium, Milt Mason, a 69-year-old Brewers fan, decided to sit atop the scoreboard until the team could draw a home crowd of 40,000. He was there for about 40 days. To the delight of a Bat Day crowd of 44,387 on August 16, Mason descended from his trailer following the Brewers 4-3 win over the Indians. He slid down a rope from his perch sustaining burns to his hands and legs. After a long illness, Mason died on June 12, 1973 but not before being recognized as the original Bernie Brewer. The Bernie Brewer character became the team's mascot in 1973, as a tribute to Mason, appearing as a cheerful man with a big mustache. In the early 1980s, a beer-barreled chalet was built for him inside the stadium where he led the crowd in cheering. Following each home run and every victory by the Brewers, he slid down and plunged himself into a huge beer mug in celebration. He was joined by a companion Bonnie Brewer, who playfully swatted at the backside of the opposing team's third base coach with a broom as the field crew swept the base paths. Bernie Brewer was a fixture at Brewers home games until 1984, when the Brewers re-built the bleachers, replacing the chalet with a sound tower and sending Bernie into retirement. By popular demand, Bernie Brewer came out of retirement in 1993, when the fans voted for his return. Bernie was brought back not as just a mustachioed man in lederhosen, but in a full-body costume of a man, including large foam head. The chalet was then rebuilt (it had been in storage on the third base side under the box seats) above the left-center field bleachers. The original chalet has found a home at Lakefront Brewery, a local Milwaukee brewery and may be viewed during their brewery tour.http://www.lakefrontbrewery.com/about Present At Miller Park, the current home of the Milwaukee Brewers, Bernie Brewer has his own \\"dugout\\" atop the bleachers behind left field, where he continues to lead the cheering at every home game. Currently he slides down a plastic yellow slide, no longer into a vat of beer but onto a platform in the shape of home plate when a Brewer hits a home run, while a sign tower with Bob Uecker's trademark home run call (\\"Get up, get up, get outta here, GONE!!\\") lights up above the Dugout. In 2009, Kalahari Resorts bought the rights to the bottom platform, and renamed it The Kalahari Splash Zone. Joseph and Cecelia S. of Milwaukee WI had their wedding ceremony in Bernie's Chalet in 2008. They are the only couple to be married in the chalet to this day.

It is the third film in the Beverly Hills Cop trilogy. Murphy again plays Detroit cop Axel Foley, who once again returns to Beverly Hills, California, to stop a gang of counterfeiters who are responsible for the death of his boss. Foley teams up with his friend, Beverly Hills detective Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold), and his investigation leads him to an amusement park known as Wonder World. The film features a number of cameo appearances by well-known film personalities, including Robert B. Sherman, Arthur Hiller, John Singleton, Joe Dante, Barbet Schroeder, Peter Medak, special effects legend Ray Harryhausen, and George Lucas as a ride patron. Beverly Hills Cop III was released on May 25, 1994, and grossed $42.6 million in the United States, and $76.5 million at the foreign box office for a worldwide total of $119.2 million. However, the film was considered by critics and Murphy himself as the weakest film in the trilogy. This was Gil Hill's final film role before his death on February 29, 2016. Plot One night in Detroit, Axel Foley (Eddie Murphy) plans to arrest a gang of car thieves who run a local chop shop. Unbeknownst to his boss, Inspector G. Douglas Todd (Gil Hill), Axel has canceled the SWAT, intending to raid the shop using only his team. Meanwhile, a group of four men arrive at the chop shop to pick up a cube van that the car thieves had hijacked. The leader of the group confirms that the vehicle still contains its cargo, which consists of crates labeled as property of the U.S. government, then has his men execute the car thieves. As the murderers are about to leave, Axel, unaware of what has happened inside, proceeds with his plan to enter the shop and quickly finds his team outgunned. Todd, arriving moments later, shoots down one of the men, only to be shot down himself by the group's leader. As the perpetrators escape in the cube van, an angry Axel gives chase in one of the partially disassembled cars from the shop, successfully maiming another one of the men with a bullet wound, only for his boss (who is driving the van) to push him out and get run over by Foley, killing him instantly. Foley is prevented from killing the last two men by Secret Service Agent Steve Fulbright (Stephen McHattie), who intercepts his vehicle. Fulbright informs Axel that the killer must remain on the loose because the federal government is pursuing a larger scheme in which he is involved. After Todd's funeral, Axel learns that several clues left behind by the killers point to Wonder World, a theme park in Beverly Hills, California, owned by \\"Uncle\\" Dave Thornton (Alan Young). Axel arrives in Beverly Hills and reunites with his friend Billy Rosewood (Judge Reinhold), who has been promoted to \\"Deputy Director of Operations for Joint Systems Interdepartmental Operational Command\\" (DDO-JSIOC), and meets Jon Flint (Hector Elizondo), Billy's new partner after John Taggart's retirement. Flint calls his friend Ellis DeWald (Timothy Carhart), the head of Wonder World's park security, to let him know that Axel's coming to the park for his investigation. Axel meets and befriends Janice Perkins (Theresa Randle) whilst touring the park's behind-the-scenes facilities. Later, he is spotted by security, shot at and attacked hand-to-hand. Axel retreats to the surface where he cuts in line to enter the Spider Ferris wheel ride. The guards accidentally jam the ride, placing two little kids' lives in danger. Axel rescues them and is subsequently taken to park manager Orrin Sanderson (John Saxon). When DeWald is called in to contest the claim that Axel was attacked by the security men without prior challenge, Axel immediately recognizes DeWald as Todd's killer, but Rosewood and Flint refuse to believe that claim because DeWald is keeping an impeccable public reputation. However, Axel is later visited by Uncle Dave and Janice, who inform him that the Wonder World park's designer and Dave's close friend, Roger Fry, has mysteriously disappeared while inspecting the grounds two weeks ago, leaving only a letter with a cryptic message. He tries to heckle DeWald into revealing his criminal involvements, despite continued admonishments by Agent Fulbright, but DeWald proves too smooth to be caught in a mistake. When Axel later digs deeper into a closed-off section of the park, he finds out that DeWald and Sanderson run a counterfeiting ring that uses Wonder World as a front, and DeWald was at the chop shop in Detroit to get his hands on blank printing paper used for American currency. Axel later meets with Uncle Dave to ask him about further details to find a piece of viable evidence, and thereby discovers that Fry's warning letter is actually written on a sheet of the stolen mint paper. Before he can make use of that evidence, however, Uncle Dave is shot by DeWald, and Axel is framed for his shooting. After getting away from DeWald and bringing Uncle Dave to a hospital, Axel sets out to prove his innocence by storming the park, calling Rosewood and Flint to assist him. The resulting shootout kills DeWald's henchmen, and after a hand-to-hand fight Axel shoots and kills DeWald. Agent Fulbright appears to explain that Axel was right, but Axel realizes his actual involvement with the counterfeiter and shoots him during a brief struggle. Uncle Dave makes a full recovery, and he thanks Axel for his assistance by creating a new character for Wonder World in his honor, Axel Fox and Axel also begins a relationship with Janice. Cast * Eddie Murphy as Det. Axel Foley * Judge Reinhold as Sgt. Billy Rosewood * Hector Elizondo as Sgt. Jon Flint * Timothy Carhart as Ellis DeWald, head of Security of Wonder World * John Saxon as Orrin Sanderson * Theresa Randle as Janice Perkins * Alan Young as Uncle Dave Thornton * Stephen McHattie as Steve Fulbright, Secret Service Agent * Tracy Melchior as ticket booth lady * Bronson Pinchot as Serge * Gil Hill as Inspector Douglas Todd * Jon Tenney as Levine * Lindsey Ginter as Holloway * Dan Martin as Cooper Production Asked in 1989 about a third installment, Murphy stated: \\"There's no reason to do it. I don't need the money and it's not gonna break any new ground. How often can you have Axel Foley talk fast and get into a place he doesn't belong? But these motherfuckers are developing scripts for it. They're in pre-production. The only reason to do a Cop III is to beat the bank, and Paramount ain't gonna write me no check as big as I want to do something like that. In fact, if I do a Cop III, you can safely say, 'Ooh, he must have got a lot of money!'\\" During the script's early drafts, the plot concerned Foley, Rosewood, and Taggart going to London to rescue Captain Bogomil (Ronny Cox), who was being held hostage by terrorists during an International Police Convention. However, problems such as scripting issues and budgeting caused pre-production to slow to the point where both John Ashton and Ronny Cox had to drop out due to obligations to other film projects. Ashton's part was re-written as John Flint (H√©ctor Elizondo) and dialogue was inserted to explain that Taggart had retired and moved to Phoenix. Cox's character's absence is never addressed in this film, nor is he mentioned. However, Ashton and Cox make subtle cameos in the form of a picture on Rosewood's desk of Foley, Taggart, Rosewood, and Bogomil on a fishing trip. This is the same picture that appeared in Cop II on Bogomil's and Foley's desks. In an interview in 2012, Ronny Cox said, \\"They wanted me to be in Beverly Hills Cop III, but...I read the script.\\" Rejected ideas for Cop III included a Robert Towne screenplay (in which Foley has to deal with his celebrity status), a scenario teaming Murphy with Sean Connery as a Scotland Yard detective, and another Axel-in-London idea where his Scotland Yard counterpart would have been played by John Cleese. The last would have involved British gangsters, loosely based on the real-life Kray brothers, who were captured in Detroit and transported to London by Jeffrey (Axel's friend from Beverly Hills Cop and Beverly Hills Cop II, played by Paul Reiser), and Axel would have gone overseas after the gangsters' henchmen broke them out of custody and murdered Jeffrey. This was scrapped because producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer decided it was too close to the story of Michael Douglas' 1989 film Black Rain. When writer Steven E. de Souza was brought in, he originally wrote the story as more \\"Die Hard in a theme park\\". He was told that each of the rides he had designed would cost about $10 million to build and the whole film would cost about $70 million. When box office results for Murphy's 1992 comedy The Distinguished Gentleman came in, Paramount ordered the budget to be cut to $55 million. Paramount had earlier told Simpson and Bruckheimer that they would only outlay $25 million for a proposed version to be set in New York City, one of the main reasons that the producing team parted ways with the studio. Joel Silver was set to take over producing duties from Simpson and Bruckheimer; however, negotiations on a large budget resulted in production delays leading to Silver quitting production. It was at this time that producers Mace Neufeld and Robert Rehme took on the project. Consequently, the film became more about the investigation and less about the action. Production was temporarily shut down to allow the Paramount top brass the chance to get to grips with the film's spiraling budget. Originally estimated at $55 million, it was soon in excess of $70 million. Of that budget, $15 million was Murphy's paycheck. =Filming locations= The final chase scene through the \\"Land of the Dinosaurs\\", featuring 11 animatronic dinosaurs, was filmed at Universal Studios Stage 37. Exterior scenes set in the theme park were filmed at Paramount's Great America in Santa Clara, California after Knott's Berry Farm declined permission. The three-armed Ferris wheel rescue scene used Great America's Sky Whirl. One shootout sequence was filmed inside the Earthquake! ride at the Universal Studios theme park. The Sherman Brothers wrote the WonderWorld theme song for the film. Soundtrack A soundtrack containing mostly R&B; music was released on May 10, 1994, by MCA Records. It peaked at 158 on the Billboard 200 and 66 on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums. While Harold Faltermeyer did not return to score this film, his co-producer from the previous franchise entries, Keith Forsey, did produce and co-write a new song entitled \\"Keep the Peace\\", performed by INXS. However, Nile Rodgers covered Faltermeyer's \\"Axel F\\" in a breakbeat hardcore version. This is the only film in the series not to feature a song performed by The Pointer Sisters, although \\"Neutron Dance\\" was used in the film's trailer. Beverly Hills Cop featured their song \\"Neutron Dance\\", while Beverly Hills Cop II had their song \\"Be There\\". Crew comments In an interview in 1994, Eddie Murphy said that Beverly Hills Cop III is \\"different from the trilogy's first installment because Axel is more mature and no longer the wisecracking rookie cop.\\" During that same year, Murphy said he thought \\"Beverly Hills Cop III was infinitely better than Beverly Hills Cop II.\\" He later claimed during an interview in 2006 on Inside the Actors Studio that he felt the third film was \\"atrocious\\" and such a disgrace that \\"the character was kind of banished for a while [from Hollywood].\\" He said he felt the third film did not reveal enough of the \\"edginess\\" of Axel that was present in the first two films. He also said he hopes to return the edgy qualities to the character when he reprises the role next time, and is going to pay more attention to the development of the project and its quality. About the experience on making the movie, John Landis said: \\"Cop 3 was a very strange experience. The script wasn't any good, but I figured, ‚ÄúSo what? I'll make it funny with Eddie\\". But then I discovered on the first day when I started giving Eddie some shtick, he said, ‚ÄúYou know, John‚Ä¶ Axel Foley is an adult now. He's not a wiseass anymore\\". So, with Beverly Hills Cop 3, I had this strange experience where he was very professional, but he just wasn't funny. I would try to put him in funny situations, and he would find a way to step around them. It's an odd movie. There are things in it I like, but it's an odd movie.\\"https://collider.com/the-collider-interview-john-landis-part-ii/ In an interview with The A.V. Club in 2009, Bronson Pinchot claimed that Eddie Murphy \\"was really depressed\\" at the time Beverly Hills Cop III was being filmed, claiming that Murphy was low-spirited and had a low energy level. Critical response Beverly Hills Cop III was criticized harshly and currently holds a 9% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 53 reviews. The critical consensus reads; \\"Despite being set at an amusement park, Beverly Hills Cop III forgets to have any fun as it churns out uninspired violence and witless gags, with an uncharacteristically lethargic Eddie Murphy not helping matters.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a normalized score, rated it 16/100 based on 15 reviews, which indicates an \\"overwhelming dislike\\". Richard Natale of Variety called it \\"a return to form by Eddie Murphy\\" that \\"runs out of steam before the end\\". Caryn James of The New York Times wrote that the film is designed to be a foolproof and safe money-maker, but Murphy plays Foley too straight. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly rated it D- and called Murphy's performance joyless and depressing. Beverly Hills Cop III was nominated for two Golden Raspberry Awards, for Landis as Worst Director and the film as Worst Remake or Sequel.

It was re- announced in 2006, when producer Jerry Bruckheimer announced his intention to resurrect the film series, though he eventually gave up his option to produce the film, instead passing production duties to Lorenzo di Bonaventura. In September 2006 a script, an amalgamation of several earlier drafts, was presented to Murphy who was reported to be \\"very happy\\" with the outline which was described as an attempt to recapture the \\"feel of the original\\". Murphy admitted one of his motivations for making a fourth Beverly Hills Cop film was to make up for the fact that the third film was \\"horrible\\" and that \\"he didn't want to leave (the series) like that\\". In May 2008, Rush Hour director Brett Ratner was officially named director, who promised the film would return under the series' standard \\"R\\" rating, rather than as a rumored watered down PG-13. Michael Brandt and Derek Haas were hired as screenwriters to improve on the existing script in July 2008 and completed a new script, under the working title Beverly Hills Cop 2009, which would see Foley return to Beverly Hills to investigate the murder of his friend Billy Rosewood. The script was eventually rejected, leaving Ratner to work on a new idea. In an interview with Empire magazine, Ratner stated \\"I'm working very hard on the fourth. It's very difficult, especially since there were three before. We're trying to figure out some important things, like where do we start? Is Axel retired? Is he in Beverly Hills? Is he on vacation? Does Judge Reinhold return as the loveable Billy Rosewood? Many questions to figure out, but I'm hoping to have a script before film disappears from our existence.\\" Although Murphy himself committed to the project, it was unconfirmed whether the series' other principal actors, Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Ronny Cox or Bronson Pinchot would also return, though Ratner stated in late 2009 that he was trying to convince Reinhold and Ashton to reprise their roles. Harold Faltermeyer's \\"Axel F\\", however, would definitely be returning for the proposed fourth installment, with Ratner quoted as saying \\"It'll be back but it'll be a whole new interpretation.\\" On November 15, 2010, Ratner stated in an interview with MTV that there was still a possibility that they will make a fourth film, but that it wouldn't be \\"anytime soon.\\" In October 2011, Murphy discussed a possible fourth film, stating, \\"They're not doing it. What I'm trying to do now is produce a TV show starring Axel Foley's son, and Axel is the chief of police now in Detroit. I'd do the pilot, show up here and there. None of the movie scripts were right; it was trying to force the premise. If you have to force something, you shouldn't be doing it. It was always a rehash of the old thing. It was always wrong.\\" During late Summer 2013, after CBS decided to pass on the TV series, Paramount decided to move forward with the fourth film. On September 13, 2013, Jerry Bruckheimer stated he was in talks to produce. On December 6, 2013, it was announced that Eddie Murphy would again reprise the role of Axel Foley and Brett Ratner would direct. On May 2, 2014, Deadline announced that screenwriters Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec would be penning the screenplay. On June 27, 2014, in an interview with Rolling Stone, Murphy discussed returning to the edgier type character of Axel Foley after years of making family-friendly films. \\"I haven't done a street guy, working class, blue- collar character in ages so maybe it's like, 'Oh, wow, I didn't remember he was able to do that'\\", Murphy said. According to studio reports on the film's plot, Foley returns to Detroit after leaving his job in Beverly Hills and he's faced with the coldest winter on record to navigate the new rules and old enemies of one of America's most tenacious cities. The state of Michigan approved $13.5 million in film incentives, based on an estimated $56.6 million of filmmaker spending in the state. The film was supposed to be shot in and around Detroit and was estimated to provide jobs for 352 workers. The film was originally scheduled for a March 25, 2016 release, but on May 6, 2015, Paramount Pictures pulled Beverly Hills Cop IV from its release schedule, due to script concerns. On October 1, 2019, in an interview with Collider, Murphy confirmed that production on Beverly Hills Cop IV will commence once the filming of Coming 2 America has wrapped. On November 14, 2019, Deadline Hollywood announced that Paramount Pictures made a one-time license deal with an option for a sequel to Netflix to create the fourth film. By May 2020, after delays in the filmmaking business caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Arbi and Fallah confirmed they are still attached as co-directors and that a new screenwriter was working on a new script for the film.

For his crimes, Skaf is serving a 31-year prison sentence with a non-parole period of 28 years, and will be eligible for parole in 2033. He was originally sentenced to 55 years with a 40-year non-parole period, but that was modified several times upon appeal. Early life Skaf's mother Baria worked as a cleaner and aged care worker, and his father Mustapha worked for State Rail in Sydney, gaining a good reputation among his colleagues. Bilal attended Strathfield South High School in Enfield, New South Wales and left school at 14 and worked as a spray painter before his father used his own good employment record to get his son on the State Rail payroll. This is despite Bilal having gained convictions for shoplifting, theft and carjackings. Gang rapes In 2000, Bilal Skaf led a gang of Lebanese Australians that engaged in a series of gang rapes in Sydney against women and girls as young as 14 years. In 2002, nine men, including Skaf, were sentenced to a total of more than 240 years' jail. Skaf was engaged at the time of his arrest and although his fianc√©e stood by him during his trial, she ended their engagement soon after his conviction. Skaf's response was to sketch cartoons depicting his former fianc√©e being raped and murdered. Since he was first charged in November 2000, Skaf has remained unrepentant. During his trial, he claimed he was involved only in cases of consensual sex, laughed when his verdict was read and swore at the judge when he received his sentence. On 16 September 2005, the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal reduced Skaf's 55-year sentence to a maximum of 28 years, with parole available after 22 years. NSW Attorney General Bob Debus decided that the government would seek leave for an appeal to the High Court of Australia against the sentence reduction. An earlier appeal had already reduced his sentence to 46 years, after a successful appeal against one of his convictions. On 3 February 2006, the High Court refused leave to appeal, arguing that the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal had been left with no choice because of the many errors by the trial judge in sentencing Skaf to 46 years. That meant he could be freed at the age of 42 in 2023. A further appeal led to a 31-year sentence being imposed. Skaf will now be eligible for release on 11 February 2033. Family Bilal Skaf is the brother of Mohammed Skaf, also a gang rape attacker serving 32 years' jail for his part in the attacks. Bilal and Mohammed are the sons of Mustapha and Baria Skaf, who emigrated to Australia from Lebanon in the 1970s. In 2002, Mustapha Skaf was accused of offering a bribe to a prison officer. He allegedly phoned the maximum security facility at 1:30 pm on Wednesday, 22 September 2002, and was put through to a duty officer. Mustapha gave his name and telephone number and asked to speak to his son, Bilal. When the officer told him that outside calls had to be booked in advance and approved for set times, Mustapha offered to pay $100 to be put through to his son. The officer dismissed the offer and ended the conversation. He immediately called the number from the calling number display and Mustapha Skaf answered. In September 2002, Bilal's mother, Baria, was caught on video attempting to smuggle a letter (to his then- fianc√©e) out of the prison. She was barred from visiting all NSW jails for a period of two years. Prison life Bilal Skaf began his sentence in Sydney's Long Bay Correctional Centre but was soon moved to maximum security in Goulburn Gaol after prison officers uncovered plans by fellow inmates to inject him with HIV-infected blood. In March 2003, he was charged with writing a threatening letter to Corrective Services Commissioner, Ron Woodham. The letter had been found in an internal prison mailbox. The letter said: \\"Don't take this as a threat but if all Muslims aren't released by January 2003 Australia and citizens will be in danger of bombing\\". White powder had been put into the letter. While awaiting a court appearance for the letter incident, in July 2003, drawings of gang rape were discovered in Skaf's prison cell. The drawings depicted violence and rape against his former fianc√©e, who had ended their relationship in March 2003. After she had cut off ties with Skaf, she was subjected to threatening phone calls and letters. She now says he can \\"rot in hell\\". According to Commissioner Woodham, Skaf has not shown remorse for his crimes. He also says Skaf has warned prison officers to be careful outside of work, as they may be shot. In April 2015, Skaf was attacked by two other inmates in jail and sustained \\"serious facial injuries\\".

Established on 16 March 1951 as a subordinate agency of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the BGS was renamed the Bundespolizei (Federal Police) on 1 July 2005 to reflect its transition to a multi-faceted police agency with control over border, railway and air security. This was controversial due to the German constitution expressly granting law enforcement power to the states. The fact that the border guard function was so limited allowed its formation notwithstanding this restriction, however in the modern day it has become a full-fledged police force. History The newly-established Federal Republic of Germany wanted to set up its own federal border guard and police. The founding act of the Federal Border Guard (Bundesgrenzschutz, BGS) was adopted on 14 November 1950 by the federal cabinet and on 15 February 1951 by the Bundestag. The BGS was established on 16 March 1951. The Cold War had begun but travel between East and West Germany was not yet restricted by the Berlin Wall (1961). When German nationals could move freely from the DDR to the BRD in Berlin, people attempting to cross illegally elsewhere were likely to be either commercial smugglers or espionage agents carrying contraband (e.g., radio transmitters.). Occupation authorities judged this could be better policed by a permanent force of Germans who knew the border woods and mountains intimately (rather than British or US troops who rotated out of Germany after a year or two) and at German rather than Allied expense. The BGS was organized along paramilitary lines in battalions, companies, and platoons, and was armed as light infantry. It remained a police force controlled by the Ministry of Interior rather than by the Ministry of Defense. A maritime border guard unit (Seegrenzschutz) was formed as part of the BGS on 1 July 1951. It consisted of approximately 550 members and was equipped with fourteen large patrol craft and several helicopters. On 3 October 1953 the Bundespasskontrolldienst (passport control service), which had been established on 19 September 1951, was transferred to the BGS and was now deployed on the entire German border. The BGS was initially a paramilitary force of 10,000 which was responsible for policing a zone deep along the border. It eventually became the basis for the present national semi- militarised police force. On 19 June 1953, its authorized strength was expanded to 20,000 men, a mixture of conscripts and volunteers equipped with armoured cars, anti-tank guns, helicopters, trucks and jeeps. By 1956, it had a strength of 16,414 men. Upon the formation of the Bundeswehr in 1955, over 10,000 members of the BGS voluntarily joined the new German military in 1956. The Seegrenzschutz was completely absorbed into the German Navy that year. A new maritime border guard was set up in the fall of 1964 as the Bundesgrenzschutz See (BGS See). Although it was not intended to be able to repel a full-scale invasion, the BGS was tasked with dealing with small-scale threats to the security of West Germany's borders, including the international borders as well as the inner German border. It had limited police powers within its zone of operations to enable it to deal with threats to the peace of the border. The BGS had a reputation for assertiveness which made it especially unpopular with East Germans, who routinely criticized it as a reincarnation of the Schutzstaffel from the days of Nazi Germany. It also sustained a long-running feud with the Bundeszollverwaltung over which agency should have the lead responsibility for the inner German border., pp. 96‚Äì97 The passing of the German Emergency Acts on 30 May 1968 relieved the BGS of its quasi-military tasks as the Bundeswehr could now operate inside the Federal Republic in the case of an emergency. A military rank structure similar to that of the Bundeswehr was replaced in the mid-1970s by civil service-type personnel grades. The service uniform was green, but field units did wear camouflage fatigues and, at times, steel helmets and military training was still carried out. An Aerospatiale SA.330J Puma helicopter operated by the West German Bundesgrenzschutz in 1985. In 1972 the BGS became responsible for the security of the Federal Constitutional Court, the Bundespr√§sident (Federal President), the Bundeskanzler (Federal Chancellor), the Foreign Office and the Federal Ministry of the Interior. Although the Compulsory Border Guard Service law is still in force, in 1974 the BGS became an all volunteer force and in 1987 started recruiting women. Among other things, it was equipped with armored cars, machine guns, automatic rifles, tear gas, hand grenades, rifle grenades, and antitank weapons. All personnel on border and security duty wore sidearms. Five units had light aircraft and helicopters to facilitate rapid access to remote border areas and for patrol and rescue missions. Some units because of specialised training and equipment, as well as operational area (e.g., Bavarian Alps) were in effect Mountain Troops. Former BGS Eurocopter EC 155 with current markings but BGS dark-green paint In addition to controlling Germany's border, the BGS Alert police served as a federal reserve force to deal with major disturbances and other emergencies beyond the scope of Land police. The BGS guarded airports and foreign embassies, and several highly trained detachments are available for special crisis situations requiring demolition equipment, helicopters, or combat vehicles. Up to 1972 the BGS was organized in eight units known as Grenzschutzgruppen (Border Guard Units) GSG-1 to GSG-8. After shortcomings in police procedures and training were revealed by the terrorist attack on Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics, a BGS task force known as Grenzschutzgruppe 9 (GSG-9) was formed to deal with terrorist incidents, especially hostage situations. The GSG-9 won world attention when it rescued eighty-six passengers on a Lufthansa Flight 181 airliner which was hijacked to Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1977. BGS canteen made in 1957 BGS Cap, in use until 1976 June 1990 saw the elimination of border patrols and control of persons at the Inner-German border. Upon German reunification on 3 October 1990, the East German Transportpolizei duties and responsibility for air security in the new states were taken over by the BGS. The German Railway Police (Bahnpolizei), formerly an independent force, was restructured under the BGS on 1 April 1992 when the railway was on the way to privatization. The reason that the L√§nder police forces are not competent for the railway is that the (formerly federally run) railway remains a federal competency. The strength of the BGS was 24,000 in early 1995.

Civita di Bagnoregio. 250px Civita di Bagnoregio is a town in the Province of Viterbo in central Italy, a suburb of the comune of Bagnoregio, east from it. It is about north of Rome. The only access is a footbridge from the nearby town, with a toll introduced in 2013. Due to the toll, communal taxes were abolished in Civita and nearby Bagnoregio. Civita is one of the most beautiful villages in Italy, famously known as ‚Äòthe dying city‚Äô.  Territory  Civita is situated in the valley of the badlands (Valle dei Calanchi), a region west of Lake Bolsena and east of the Tiber Valley, in the municipality of Bagnoregio. It consists of two main valleys: the Fossato del Rio Torbido and the Fossato del Rio Chiaro. Originally these places might have been easier to reach and were crossed by an ancient road which linked the Tiber Valley to Lake Bolsena. The morphology of this region was caused by erosion and landslides. The territory is made up of two different formations of rocks, different in chronology and in constitution. The most ancient formation is that of clay; it comes from the sea and it forms the base layer which is particularly subject to erosion. The top layers are made up of tuff and lava material. The fast erosion is due to the streams, to atmospheric agents but also to deforestation. Civita, which is inhabited by only 16 people, is situated in a solitary area and it is reachable only by a reinforced concrete pedestrian bridge built in 1995. The bridge is generally restricted to pedestrians, but to meet the requirements of residents and workers the Municipality of Bagnoregio issued a statement that these people may cross the bridge by bike or by motorcycle at certain times. The reason for its isolation is the progressive erosion of the hill and the nearby valley which create the badlands; this process is still ongoing and there is the danger that the village could disappear. This is why Civita is also known as ‚ÄúThe Dying Town‚Äù.  History  Civita di Bagnoregio was founded by Etruscans more than 2,500 years ago. Formerly there were five city gates to access the ancient town of Civita, nowadays instead, Porta Santa Maria (known as Porta Cava, as well) is the main gateway of the city. It is also possible to enter the town of Civita from the badlands valley through a tunnel carved into the rock. The layout of the whole town is of Etruscan origin, based on a cardo and decumanus orthogonal street system according to the Etruscan and Roman use, while the entire architectural cladding is of medieval and Renaissance origin. There are numerous traces of Etruscan civilisation in Civita, especially in the San Francesco Vecchio area: a little Etruscan necropolis was found in the cliff located in the area below Belvedere di San Francesco Vecchio. The cave of St Bonaventure (where it is said that Saint Francis healed the little Giovanni Fidanza, who later became Saint Bonaventure) is also an Etruscan chamber tomb. The Etruscans made Civita (whose original name is unknown) a flourishing city, thanks to its strategic position favourable for trade and thanks to its proximity to the most important communication routes of the times. Many traces of the Etruscan period are still suggestive spots: the so-called Bucaione, for example, is a deep tunnel which goes through the lowest part of the city and gives access to badlands valley directly from the town. In the past, many chamber tombs were visible. They were dug at the base of Civita‚Äôs cliff and nearby tuff walls and, over the centuries, they were destroyed by several rockfalls. Indeed, the Etruscans themselves had to face problems of seismic activity and instability, like the earthquake of 280 B.C. When the Romans arrived in 265 B.C., they took up and carried on the rainwater drainage and the stream containment works that were first started by the Etruscans. Civita (or City) was the birthplace of Saint Bonaventure, who died in 1274. The location of his boyhood house has long since fallen off the edge of the cliff. By the 16th century, Civita di Bagnoregio was beginning to decline, becoming eclipsed by its former suburb Bagnoregio. At the end of the 17th century, the bishop and the municipal government were forced to move to Bagnoregio because of a major earthquake that accelerated the old town's decline. At that time, the area was part of the Papal States. In the 19th century, Civita di Bagnoregio's location was turning into an island and the pace of the erosion quickened as the layer of clay below the stone was reached in the area where today's bridge is situated. Bagnoregio continues as a small but prosperous town, while the older site became known in Italian as La citt√† che muore (\\"The Dying Town\\"). Civita di Bagnoregio has only recently been experiencing a tourist revival. CNN in January 2020 associated the \\"over-tourism\\" with the mayor deciding to charge a minor fee for entry, which increased publicity and subsequently attendance. CNN also noted that the town had more feline inhabitants than its 12 human residents. The only access is a footbridge from the nearby town, with a toll introduced in 2013 and increased in August. Civita had 40,000 visitors in 2010, and was estimated to attract 850,000 visitors in 2017. Due to the toll, communal taxes were abolished in Civita and nearby Bagnoregio, making Bagnoregio the only town without communal taxes.  Location  Billboard at the tourist parking lot, Civita di Bagnoregio The town is noted for its striking position on top of a plateau of friable volcanic tuff overlooking the Tiber river valley. It is in constant danger of destruction as the edges of the plateau collapse due to erosion, leaving the buildings to crumble as their underlying support falls away. , there were plans to reinforce the plateau with steel rods to prevent further geological damage. = Architecture = The city is also much admired for its architecture spanning several hundred years. Civita di Bagnoregio owes much of its unaltered condition to its relative isolation; the town was able to withstand most intrusions of modernity as well as the destruction brought by two world wars. The population today is 11 people, but due to a healthy amount of bed-and-breakfasts the village gets busy in the summer months. The town was placed on the World Monuments Fund's 2006 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites, because of threats it faces from erosion and unregulated tourism.  Monuments and places of interest  Inside the village there are several medieval houses; the church of San Donato, which overlooks the main square and inside which the holy wooden crucifix is kept; Alemanni Palace, home of the Geological and Landslides Museum;Geological and Landslides Museum the Bishop‚Äôs Palace, a mill of the 16th century; the remains of the house where St. Bonaventure was born and the door of Santa Maria, with two lions holding a human head between their paws, in memory of a popular revolt of the inhabitants of Civita against the Orvieto family of Monaldeschi. In 2005 there was a proposal for the gullies of Civita to become a site of community interest.  Economy and tourism  The old village is part of the association named ‚ÄúI Borghi pi√π belli d‚ÄôItalia‚Äù. Thanks to its evocative geographical position and to its medieval buildings, each year the town is the destination of many tourists, and several times it has been used as a movie set.  Culture  = The Holy Crucifix of Civita = On Good Friday the most heartfelt event of Civita takes place: in the church of San Donato, during a touching ceremony, the Holy Crucifix is laid on a coffin in order to be transported in the secular ‚ÄúProcessione del Venerd√¨ Santo di Bagnoregio‚Äù (\\"Good Friday Procession of Bagnoregio\\"). The legend narrates that during a plague epidemic, which in 1449 hit the whole territory around Bagnoregio, the cross talked to a pious woman, who went every day before the venerated image asking with her prayers for the end of that agony. One day, while the woman was praying to Christ, she heard a voice that reassured her, saying that the Lord had fulfilled her prayers and that the pestilence would end. And indeed, after a few days, the plague was over, at the same time as the death of the pious woman. Events * At Christmas time a nativity scene takes place; the stories of Mary and Joseph set in the medieval streets. * The first Sunday of June and the second of September, in the main square, the secular Palio della Tonna (‚Äútonda‚Äù in the local dialect) is prepared. In this palio (horse race) the districts of Civita challenge each other on donkey back, supported by cheering inhabitants. * The first Sunday of June, there is the first feast day, called Maria SS. Liberatrice. * The last week of July and the first of August the Tuscia in Jazz Festival takes place with concerts, seminars and jam sessions. * The second Sunday of September the second feast day takes place, called SS. Crocifisso. Cinema and Television * Among the many movies shot in Civita: The Two Colonels (1962), directed by Stefano Vanzina; the episode Il prete of the movie Let‚Äôs Have a Riot (1970); the episode of the movie Nostalgia (1983) directed by Andrei Tarkovsky; the miniseries Pinocchio directed by Alberto Sironi transmitted on RAI 1 in 2009; Questione di Karma (2017), directed by Edoardo Falcone; Puoi baciare lo sposo (2018) directed by Alessandro Genovesi. * In Civita the initial footage of Esperan√ßa was shot, transmitted in Italy in 2002. * Furthermore Civita was the inspiration for Hayao Miyazaki for the realization of the famous movie Castle in the Sky.

He sat as a Member of Parliament for Lincoln from 1826 to 1832 and from 1835 until 1855. Sibthorp was born into a Lincoln gentry family, the son of Colonel Humphrey Waldo Sibthorp, of Canwick Hall, by his wife Susannah, daughter of Richard Ellison, of Sudbrooke Holme, Lincolnshire. His brother, Richard (1792-1879), was an Anglican clergyman (later admitted into the Roman Catholic faith).https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Sibthorp,_Richard_Waldo_(DNB00)https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Sibthorp,_Charles_De_Laet_Waldo_(DNB00) He was commissioned into the Scots Greys in 1803, promoted Lieutenant in 1806, and later transferred to the 4th Dragoon Guards, in which he reached the rank of Captain. He did not serve abroad and continued in the service until 1822, when he succeeded to the family estates and also succeeded his brother as Lieutenant-Colonel of the Royal South Lincolnshire Militia. In 1812, he married Maria, daughter and co-heiress of Ponsonby Tottenham, M.P. for Fethard, County Tipperary; they had four children.https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Sibthorp,_Charles_De_Laet_Waldo_(DNB00) Member of Parliament During Sibthorp's three decades in Parliament, he became renowned, along with Sir Robert Inglis, as one of its most reactionary members. He stoutly opposed Catholic Emancipation, Emancipation of the Jews in England, the Reform Act of 1832, the repeal of the Corn Laws, the 1851 Great Exhibition and the construction of the National Gallery. He was convinced that any changes from the Britain of his youth (in the late 18th century) were signs of degeneracy, that Britain was about to go bankrupt, and that the new railways were a passing fad which would soon give way to a return to \\"chaises, carriages and stages\\". He was opposed to all foreign influences, and offended Queen Victoria with his public suspicions of Prince Albert, the prince consort. His political views, his bluntness in expressing them, and his eccentricities made him the target of both witticisms and cartoons in Punch. He was returned to Parliament on eight occasions. Sibthorp died at his home in London, and was succeeded as MP by his son, Gervaise Waldo-Sibthorp.

They coordinated responses to England and shared their plans; by 1773 they had emerged as shadow governments, superseding the colonial legislature and royal officials. The Maryland Committee of Correspondence was instrumental in setting up the First Continental Congress, which met in Philadelphia. These served an important role in the Revolution, by disseminating the colonial interpretation of British actions between the colonies and to foreign governments. The committees of correspondence rallied opposition on common causes and established plans for collective action, and so the group of committees was the beginning of what later became a formal political union among the colonies. A total of about 7,000 to 8,000 Patriots served on these committees at the colonial and local levels, comprising most of the leadership in their communities‚Äîthe Loyalists were excluded. The committees became the leaders of the American resistance to British actions, and largely determined the war effort at the state and local level. When Congress decided to boycott British products, the colonial and local committees took charge, examining merchant records and publishing the names of merchants who attempted to defy the boycott by importing British goods. The committees promoted patriotism and home manufacturing, advising Americans to avoid luxuries, and lead a more simple life. The committees gradually extended their power over many aspects of American public life. They set up espionage networks to identify disloyal elements, displaced the royal officials, and helped topple the entire Imperial system in each colony. In late 1774 and early 1775, they supervised the elections of provincial conventions, which took over the actual operation of colonial government.Norton & Blight (2001), pp. 144‚Äì145.  Function  The function of the committees in each colony was to inform the voters of the common threat faced by all the colonies and to disseminate information from the main cities to the rural hinterlands where most of the colonists lived. As the news was typically spread in hand-written letters or printed pamphlets to be carried by couriers on horseback or aboard ships, the committees were responsible for ensuring that this news accurately reflected the views of their parent governmental body on a particular issue and was dispatched to the proper groups. Many correspondents were also members of the colonial legislative assemblies and were active in the secret Sons of Liberty or even the Stamp Act Congress of the 1760s. History The earliest committees of correspondence were formed temporarily to address a particular problem. Once a resolution was achieved, they were disbanded. The first formal committee was established in Boston in 1764 to rally opposition to the Currency Act and unpopular reforms imposed on the customs service.Richard D. Brown, Revolutionary Politics in Massachusetts: The Boston Committee of Correspondence and the Towns, 1772-1774 (1976) ch 1 During the Stamp Act Crisis the following year, New York formed a committee to urge common resistance among its neighbors to the new taxes. The Province of Massachusetts Bay correspondents responded by urging other colonies to send delegates to the Stamp Act Congress that fall. The resulting committees disbanded after the crisis was over. Boston, whose radical leaders thought it was under increasingly hostile threats by the royal government, set up the first long- standing committee with the approval of a town meeting in late 1772. By spring 1773, Patriots decided to follow the Massachusetts system and began to set up their own committees in each colony. Virginia appointed an eleven-member committee in March, quickly followed by Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. By February 1774, eleven colonies had set up their own committees; of the thirteen colonies that eventually rebelled, only North Carolina and Pennsylvania had not. =Massachusetts= In Massachusetts, in November 1772, Samuel Adams and Dr. Joseph Warren and Mercy Otis Warren formed a committee in response to the Gasp√©e Affair and in relation to the recent British decision to have the salaries of the royal governor and judges be paid by the Crown rather than the colonial assembly, which removed the colony of its means of holding public officials accountable to their constituents. In the following months, more than one hundred other committees were formed in the towns and villages of Massachusetts. The Massachusetts committee had its headquarters in Boston and under the leadership of Adams became a model for other Patriot groups. The meeting when establishing the committee gave it the task of stating \\"the rights of the colonists, and of this province in particular, as men, as Christians, and as subjects; to communicate and publish the same to the several towns in this province and to the world as the sense of this town.\\"Smith (1976), p. 368. =Virginia= In March 1773, Dabney Carr proposed the formation of a permanent Committee of Correspondence before the Virginia House of Burgesses. Virginia's own committee was formed on March 12, 1773. Its members were Peyton Randolph, Robert Carter Nicholas, Richard Bland, Richard Henry Lee, Benjamin Harrison, Edmund Pendleton, Patrick Henry, Dudley Digges, Dabney Carr, Archibald Cary, and Thomas Jefferson.Van Schreeven & Schribner (1976) =Pennsylvania= Among the last to form a committee of correspondence, Pennsylvania did so at a meeting in Philadelphia on May 20, 1774. In a compromise between the more radical and more conservative factions of political activists the committee was formed by combining the lists each proposed. That committee of 19 diversified and grew to 43, then to 66 and finally to two different groups of 100 between May 1774 and its dissolution in September 1776. One hundred sixty men participated in one or more of the committees, but only four were regularly elected to all of them: Thomas Barclay, John Cox, Jr., John Dickinson, and Joseph Reed.Ryerson (1978), pp. 39‚Äì42, 49‚Äì52, 94‚Äì100, 128‚Äì131, 156‚Äì159, 275‚Äì281. =Delaware= According to Hancock (1973), a committee of correspondence was established by Thomas McKean after ten years of agitation centered in New Castle County. In neighboring Kent County Caesar Rodney set up a second committee, followed by Sussex County. Following the recommendation of Congress in 1774, the committees were replaced by elected \\"committees of inspection\\" with a subcommittee of correspondence. The new committees specialize in intelligence work, especially the identification of men opposed to the Patriot cause. The committees were in the lead in demanding independence. The correspondence committees exchanged information with others in Boston and Philadelphia, and elsewhere. Their leadership often was drawn upon to provide Delaware with executive leaders. The committees of inspection used publicity as weapons to suppress disaffection and encourage patriotism. With imports from Britain cut off, the committees sought to make America self- sufficient, so they encouraged the raising of flax and sheep for wool. The committees helped organize local militia in the hundreds and later in the counties and all of Delaware. With their encouragement, the Delaware Assembly elected delegates to Congress favorable to independence.Hancock (1973) =North Carolina= By 1773, the political situation had deteriorated. There was concern about the courts. Massachusetts' young and ardent Boston patriot, Josiah Quincy, Jr.Lossing (1855), p. 83. visited North Carolina staying five days. He spent the night of March 26, 1773 at Cornelius Harnett's home near Wilmington, North Carolina. The two discussed and drew up plans for a Committee of Correspondence. The committee's purpose: communicate circumstances and revolutionary sentiment among the colonies. It was after this meeting that Quincy dubbed Harnett the \\"Samuel Adams of North Carolina.\\"Wells (1865), p. 421.Maier (1978), pp. 6‚Äì7. Perhaps characteristic of Committees of Correspondence members, Harnett was celebrated, distinguished, scholarly and possessed of unflinching integrity. Harnett's father (also named Cornelius Harnett) was Sheriff of Albemarle, an area covering about 11 modern counties in northeastern North Carolina.Ripley (1859) The North Carolina Committee of Correspondence formed in December 1773 in Wilmington. Although Harnett was absent, he was made chairman of the committee. Other members included John Harvey, Robert Howe, Richard Caswell, Edward Vail, John Ashe, Joseph Hewes, Samuel Johnston, and William Hooper.Daniels (1986), p. 5. =New York= In response to the news that the port of Boston would be closed under the Boston Port Act, an advertisement was posted at the Coffee-house on Wall-street in New York City, a noted place of resort for shipmasters and merchants, inviting merchants to meet on May 16, 1774 at the Fraunces Tavern \\"in order to consult on measures proper to be pursued on the present critical and important situation.\\" At that meeting, with Isaac Low as chair, they resolved to nominated a fifty-member committee of correspondence to be submitted to the public, and on May 17 they published a notice calling on the public to meet at the Coffee-house on May 19 at 1:00PM to approve the committee and appoint others as they may see fit. At the meeting on May 19, Francis Lewis was also nominated and the entire Committee of Fifty-one was confirmed. Fraunces Tavern in Lower Manhattan, meeting place of the \\"Committee of Fifty\\" on May 16, 1774 On May 23, the committee met at the coffee-house and appointed Isaac Low as permanent chairman and John Alsop as deputy chairman. The committee then formed a subcommittee which reported a letter in response to the letters from Boston, calling for a \\"Congress of Deputies from the Colonies\\" to be assembled (which became known as the First Continental Congress), which was approved by the committee. On May 30, the Committee formed a subcommittee to write a letter to the supervisors of the counties of New York to exhort them to also form similar committees of correspondence, which letter was adopted on a meeting of the Committee on May 31. On July 4, 1774, a resolution was approved to appoint five delegates contingent upon their confirmation by the freeholders of the City and County of New York, and request that the other counties also send delegates. Isaac Low, John Alsop, James Duane, Philip Livingston, and John Jay were then appointed, and the public of the City and County was invited to attend City Hall and concur in the appointments on July 7. This caused friction with the more radical Sons of Liberty (Committee of Mechanics) faction, who held the Meeting in the Fields on July 6. Three counties (Westchester, Duchess, and Albany) acquiesced to the five delegates, while three counties (Kings, Suffolk, and Orange) sent delegates of their own. =Other colonies= By July 1773, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Hampshire, and South Carolina had also formed committees. With Pennsylvania's action in May 1774 all of the colonies that eventually rebelled had such committees.Ketchum (2002), p. 245. The colonial committees successfully organized common resistance to the Tea Act and even recruited physicians who wrote drinking tea would make Americans \\"weak, effeminate, and valetudinarian for life.\\" These permanent committees performed the important planning necessary for the First Continental Congress, which convened in September 1774. The Second Congress created its own committee of correspondence to communicate the American interpretation of events to foreign nations. These committees were replaced during the revolution with Provincial Congresses. By 1780, committees of correspondence had also been formed in Great Britain and Ireland.Puls (2006), p. 206.

The party is a centralized organization established to promote the party platform as drafted in convention biennially. It is also charged with registering voters and delivering voter turnout through county organizations for Hawaii County, Kauai County, Maui County and the City and County of Honolulu. The Hawaii Democratic Party maintained political control of the state government in Hawaii for over forty years, from 1962 to 2002. Organization A major factor in the party's organization is the ethnicity of Hawaii itself. As Democrats emerged as the dominant political party in 1962, they sought to garner support from Native Hawaiians and other non- whites. This success is attributed to the efforts of portraying themselves as not belonging to the power elite. For decades, the party had little difficulty in winning local and statewide elections, with a significant number of Democrats running unopposed in certain years. The party has also established a gender-equality policy that required the election of more women to the state central committee, resulting in an equal balance of men and women in administrative positions. State-level organizational meetings are held at the precinct, district, county, and state level, biennially, during even-numbered years. The party adheres to a complex set of bylaws that addresses eligibility for membership, election of officers, holding conventions, and recruiting delegates to represent the party at conventions. A minimum of two delegates are required from each precinct, with an equal number of men and women, as required by its gender-equality policy. While there is no permanent location for state conventions, nearly all of them have been held on the island of Oahu (the most populated) since 1960. The party is governed by a Chair and the State Central Committee. That committee is composed of representatives from each senatorial district, as well as representatives from each county, for each caucuses and the Young Democrats of Hawaii. Gender equality policies require the State Central Committee to be split equally between male and female representatives. Due to the extreme geographical distance from the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington D.C., the party is relatively independent in its affairs. As a result, the national party does not typically inquire contributions for fund-raising purposes. Due to the party's dominant status in the state, there is some over-representation at national party conventions, in comparison to the population of Hawaii itself. Despite certain advantages, the party remains somewhat isolated on the national level.(Appleton & Ward 1997, p. 78) History David KawƒÅnanakoa John H. Wilson Charles J. McCarthy =Founding= The Democratic Party of Hawaii was formed on April 30, 1900 by supporters of the queen in the wake of a plague quarantine in Honolulu. The meeting brought together five men: John H. Wilson, son of Marshal of the Kingdom Charles B. Wilson; John S. McGrew, a doctor and supporter of KalƒÅkaua; Charles J. McCarthy, a saloon owner and former Honolulu Rifle; David KawƒÅnanakoa, prince of the House of KawƒÅnanakoa; and Delbert Evener Metzger, an engineer from Kaua'i. The group believed that it was necessary for a party in Hawaii, now a region of the US, to have a national counterpart to survive and established the Democratic Party of Hawaii. The intention of the party was to promote Jeffersonian philosophy and home rule. Following the Overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy, the Reform Party of Hawaii seized control of government and intended to annex Hawaii to the United States. The reformers became affiliated with the Republican Party for this support of Hawaii's annexation in contrast to the Democrats' opposition. The American Union Party became the regional Republican party in Hawaii, leaving the Democratic Party for any opposition group. The first convention of the Democratic Party of Hawaii was held on May 16 that year and was attended by 500 people. Later that year, KawƒÅnanakoa attended the 1900 Democratic National Convention in Kansas City, becoming the first royal attendee. At the convention, KawƒÅnanakoa formed an affiliation between the Democratic Party of Hawaii and the Democratic Party of the United States. =Elections of 1900= Leading up to the election of 1900, it became apparent the radically nationalist Home Rule Party became the most popular. Republicans who had been rejected for the unpopular overthrow of the monarchy and promotion of white supremacy, offered a coalition between the Democrats and Republicans. Democrats refused the offer and Home Rule Party came to power. But the election of 1900 was based more on animosity toward the Republican Party for dethroning the monarchy than the Home Rule Party's functionality once in power.(Appleton & Ward 1997, p. 73) Due to the extremism of the Home Rule, they were ineffective. Similarly, the Democrats were also consumed with infighting. In the following elections, voters perceived little difference between the internal strife of the Democratic Party and the Home Rule Party. Since the 1900 election, Republicans had formed the Haole-Hawaiian Alliance. This deal with made with former Home Rule members who left the infighting. The Republicans then regained power. In the subsequent years, Democrats supported the stronger Home Rule Party until it dissolved in 1912. The party managed to elect Democrats Joseph J. Fern and Wilson as mayors of Honolulu, along with several other positions, but maintained a weak reputation throughout the territorial years. Among the issues was that offices under leadership positions were frequently held by Republicans, with Democrats achieving leadership positions they only brought limited powers, especially against Republican policies. =Territory of Hawaii= After the overthrow of the monarchy and annexation, an oligarchy of powerful sugar corporations called the Big Five effectively controlled government in the Hawaiian Islands, making hundreds of millions of dollars in profits. The oligarchy of Castle & Cooke, Alexander & Baldwin, C. Brewer & Co., Amfac, and Theo H. Davies & Co. worked in favor of the Hawaii Republican Party. The plantations needed labor and the Native Hawaiian population was insufficient to fill the demand. Immigrants from around the world such as Puerto Rico, Korea, and most particularly Japan and the Philippines were brought to Hawaii. In response to the flood of immigrants, Democrats became more nativist. Democrats like McCarthy and Oren Long pushed a compromise of allowing migrant workers that would eventually return to where they came from rather than establish themselves in Hawaii. =Burns Machine= Up to the Revolution of 1954, Democrats held a stronger pro-Hawaiian stance, resulting in anti-Asian sentiments based on fears Asian Americans would outperform Hawaiians in education and job performance. Up to World War II, half of elected Democrats were Hawaiian while only a quarter were Caucasian. Following World War II, a local movement to empower laborers in Hawaii was formed. Honolulu Police Department officer John A. Burns began organizing the plantation laborers, especially the Japanese Americans and Filipino Americans he came to know while on his police beats.http://www.scottfoster.org/40_Years_After.htm He began what would be known as the \\"Burns Machine\\". He believed grassroots organizing and the power of elections could overturn the corruption of the Republicans in power. The movement received its biggest boost when Burns successfully influenced Japanese American veterans who fought in World War II to become involved, notably incumbent Daniel Inouye. The coalition was composed of the Democratic Party, Communist Party, 442nd Infantry Regiment, ILWU, and other organizations. During the Burns movement, the party shifted towards egalitarianism, allowing an untapped Japanese voter base to bring them to power. Burns' efforts culminated in his election to the governorship after attaining statehood, heralding a forty-year era of Democratic rule in Hawai. =Statehood= Party standing in the U.S. Congress was strengthened once Hawaii achieved statehood in 1959. For the first time, political representation was fully justified as newly elected representatives were allowed to cast votes. The achievement of statehood had also significantly enhanced the party's status within national party organizations.(Appleton & Ward 1997, p. 74) Democrats have held onto a solid majority since 1962, with near-complete control over the state's congressional delegation and its legislative and executive branch. At the national level, Democrats held all of Hawaii's seats in the Senate and the House. Both positions of governor and lieutenant governor were also filled by Democrats, with the former being held by John Burns, the organizer of the Burns Machine in 1954. Burns was instrumental in the revitalization of the party following World War II. He was reelected two more times and died shortly after his third term in office in 1975. Factionalism within the party was a problem in the late 1960s, as a newer progressive wing (led by Tom Gill) began to challenge the older wing headed by incumbent governor Burns. This division in the party reached a high point in 1970, when Gill challenged Burns for the next gubernatorial term. As a supporter of environmental protection, consumer protection and other progressive causes, Gill lost the primary election to Burns. While factional struggles continued into the 1970s, the Burns regime remained in power.(Appleton & Ward 1997, p. 75) The strength of the Burns Machine has diminished since the mid-1980s, primarily due to the advanced ages of its original supporters. There has been renewed strength in the progressive wing. Since 1994, progressive supporters have held control over the party central committee, having run unopposed in certain years. The party has remained successful due to its heavy usage of the media, relying on grassroots activities. Campaign tactics and promotion of party ideals have been characterized by rice dinners, rallies, door-to-door campaigning, and sign waving in public areas. These activities have helped maintain the party's large membership and its status as the majority party of Hawaii.(Appleton & Ward 1997, p. 76) Political positions =Liberalism= The Democratic Party has tended to hold a position on social issues based on how an issue would affects bystanders and/or the environment. The party's platform is based on the values of liberty and social justice, with compassion and respect towards the individual. In 1997, the reciprocal beneficiary registration gave recognition to same-sex couples. In 1970 Democratic Governor John A. Burns legalized abortion in Hawaii. But this position has also led to restrictions. In 2006 strict smoking bans were put in place based on the effects of secondhand smoke on bystanders. Since the Revolution of 1954, the Democratic Party of Hawaii has been considered progressive in its center-left ideologies. The party has promoted racial tolerance, multiculturalism, and protection of minorities. =Trade unionism= The Democratic Party has asserted itself as Hawaii's labor party since gaining support from unions and plantation workers in the 1950s. The party has supported workers rights and collective bargaining. Opposition has come from employers and small business owners who feel their rights have been neglected because of the emphasis on employee protection and rights. =Economics= The Democrats prefer increased regulation of big companies because of the relatively small marketplace in Hawaii and past experiences with monopolies and oligopolies, such as the Big Five employer monopoly on the job market. The shipping and airline industries in particular are targeted for regulation. The Democrats tend to be closely involved with the tourism industry. The party believes in the simplification of government processes on the local and state level, with integration of databases to promote efficiency in these areas. =Environment= The Democratic Party has favored conservation efforts such as wildlife sanctuaries and reserves. Pollution reduction initiatives have received bipartisan support in Hawaii. The reduction of one's carbon footprint is reflected in the party's encouragement of using clean energy sources, also with environmentally friendly modes of transportation. =Healthcare= The party platform supports a public health care system with development long-term financing solutions for individual care. The party has expressed support towards single payer universal health care coverage with the inclusion of a public option in this plan. The party does not support the denial of coverage towards women for abortion services. Democrats have been involved with healthcare issues and supportive of non-profit healthcare providers. They are also responsible for the Hawaii Prepaid Health Care Act. =Religion= Religion in the Democratic Party varies among individuals. Governor John A. Burns, a devout Roman Catholic, allowed Hawaii to become the first state to legalize abortion. He put his religious views aside when he decided not to veto the bill.

As Kirchner's father searched for a job, the family moved frequently and Kirchner attended schools in Frankfurt and Perlen until his father earned the position of Professor of Paper Sciences at the College of technology in Chemnitz, where Kirchner attended secondary school. Although Kirchner's parents encouraged his artistic career they also wanted him to complete his formal education so in 1901, he began studying architecture at the K√∂nigliche Technische Hochschule (royal technical university) of Dresden. The institution provided a wide range of studies in addition to architecture, such as freehand drawing, perspective drawing and the historical study of art.\\"The Student Years of the Br√ºcke and their Teachers\\", ingentaconnect.com (abstract of book by Peter Lasko), from Art History, Volume 20, Number 1, March 1997, pp. 61‚Äì99.

Marzella (1909‚Äì10), Moderna Museet in Stockholm In 1905, Kirchner, along with Bleyl and two other architecture students, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff and Erich Heckel, founded the artists group Die Br√ºcke (\\"The Bridge\\"). From then on, he committed himself to art. The group aimed to eschew the prevalent traditional academic style and find a new mode of artistic expression, which would form a bridge (hence the name) between the past and the present. They responded both to past artists such as Albrecht D√ºrer, Matthias Gr√ºnewald and Lucas Cranach the Elder, as well as contemporary international avant-garde movements. As part of the affirmation of their national heritage, they revived older media, particularly woodcut prints. Vier Holzplastiken, 1912, Dallas Museum of Art Their group was one of the seminal ones which in due course had a major impact on the evolution of modern art in the 20th century and created the style of Expressionism.\\"The Artists' Association 'Br√ºcke'\\", Br√ºcke Museum. Retrieved 7 September 2007. The group met initially in Kirchner's first studio, which had previously been a butcher's shop. Bleyl described it as \\"that of a real bohemian, full of paintings lying all over the place, drawings, books and artist‚Äôs materials ‚Äî much more like an artist‚Äôs romantic lodgings than the home of a well-organised architecture student\\". Kirchner's studio became a venue which overthrew social conventions to allow casual love- making and frequent nudity. Group life-drawing sessions took place using models from the social circle, rather than professionals, and choosing quarter-hour poses to encourage spontaneity. Bleyl described one such model, Isabella, a fifteen-year-old girl from the neighbourhood, as \\"a very lively, beautifully built, joyous individual, without any deformation caused by the silly fashion of the corset and completely suitable to our artistic demands, especially in the blossoming condition of her girlish buds.\\"Simmons, Sherwin. \\"Ernst Kirchner's Streetwalkers: Art, Luxury, and Immorality in Berlin, 1913‚Äì16\\", The Art Bulletin, March 2000, from findarticles.com.

Retrieved 29 September 2016. In September and October 1906, the first group exhibition was held, focused on the female nude, in the showroom of K.F.M. Seifert and Co. in Dresden. In 1906, he met Doris Gro√üe, who was his favoured model until 1911. Between 1907 and 1911, he stayed during the summer at the Moritzburg lakes and on the island of Fehmarn (which he revisited until 1914) with other Br√ºcke members; his work featured the female nude in natural settings. In 1911, he moved to Berlin, where he founded a private art school, MIUM-Institut, in collaboration with Max Pechstein with the aim of promulgating \\"Moderner Unterricht im Malen\\" (modern teaching of painting). This was not a success and closed the following year, when he also began a relationship with Erna Schilling that lasted the rest of his life. In 1913, his writing of Chronik der Br√ºcke (Br√ºcke chronicle) led to the ending of the group. At this time, he established an individual identity with his first solo exhibition, which took place at the Essen Folkwang Museum. During the next two years, he painted a series of \\"Stra√üenszenen\\" (street scenes) showing the streets of Berlin, with the central characters of street walkers. Kirchner's Berlin studio in 1915 At the onset of the First World War in September 1914, Kirchner volunteered for military service. In July 1915 he was sent to Halle an der Saale to train as a driver in the reserve unit of the 75th Mansfeld Field Artillery Regiment. Kirchner's riding instructor, Professor Hans Fehr, arranged for Kirchner to be discharged after a mental breakdown. Kirchner then returned to Berlin and continued to work, producing many paintings including Self-Portrait as a Soldier (1915); in December 1915 he was admitted to Dr. Kohnstamm‚Äôs sanatorium in K√∂nigstein in Taunus, where he was diagnosed with a strong dependency on Veronal, and alcoholism. In a letter to Dr. Karl Hagemann, a friend and patron, Kirchner writes: \\"After lengthy struggles I now find myself here for a time to put my mind into some kind of order. It is a terribly difficult thing, of course, to be among strangers so much of the day. But perhaps I‚Äôll be able to see and create something new. For the time being, I would like more peace and absolute seclusion. Of course, I long more and more for my work and my studio. Theories may be all very well for keeping a spiritual balance, but they are grey and shadowy compared with work and life\\". Throughout 1916, Kirchner periodically returned to Berlin for a few weeks at a time to continue his work at his studio; he also produced a series of oil paintings, and many drawings, during his stays in K√∂nigstein. After an exhibition of his work at the gallery of Ludwig Schames, in Frankfurt am Main, in October 1916, Kirchner sold many works and began to do well financially. In December, he suffered from a nervous breakdown and was admitted to Dr. Edel‚Äôs sanatorium in Berlin Charlottenburg. Self-Portrait as a Soldier (1915), Allen Memorial Art Museum in Oberlin, Ohio Davos In 1917, at the suggestion of Eberhard Grisebach, Helene Spengler invited Kirchner to Davos where he viewed an exhibition of Ferdinand Hodler's paintings. Kirchner's first visit to Davos coincided with a spell of exceptionally cold weather and he returned to Berlin after a stay of only ten days. Eberhard Grisebach visited him in March, writing to Helen Spengler of Kirchner's condition: \\"I spent two mornings with Kirchner which I shall never forget. I found him sitting on a very low chair next to a small, hot stove in a yellow-painted, sloping-roofed attic. Only with the help of a stick was he able to walk, staggering around the room. ... A colourfully painted curtain concealed a large collection of paintings. When we began to look at them, he came alive. Together with me, he saw all his experiences drift by on canvas, the small, timid-looking woman set aside what we had seen and brought a bottle of wine. He made short explanatory remarks in a weary voice. Each picture had its own particular colourful character, a great sadness was present in all of them; what I had previously found to be incomprehensible and unfinished now created the same delicate and sensitive impression as his personality. Everywhere a search for style, for psychological understanding of his figures. The most moving was a self- portrait in uniform with his right hand cut off. Then he showed me his travel permit for Switzerland. He wanted to go back to Davos... and implored me to ask father for a medical certificate. ... As the woman with him rightly said, though many people want to help him, nobody is able to do so any longer. ... When I was leaving, I thought of Van Gogh‚Äôs fate and thought that it would be his as well, sooner or later. Only later will people understand and see how much he has contributed to painting\\". Standing Nude with Hat, 1910, St√§del Museum in Frankfurt am Main Soon after, Kirchner's close friend and mentor, Botho Graef died and Kirchner decided to return to Davos for treatment. There he was under the care of Dr. Lucius Spengler who forced Kirchner to adhere to strict rules and routine. Kirchner deeply resented this and did everything in his power to deceive the doctor: \\"Spengler didn‚Äôt know what to do with me, for my deception was totally alien to this excellent man‚Äôs way of thinking\\". To avoid being under constant watch, Kirchner moved to the Reusch Hut on the Stafelalp in the summer of 1917. Kirchner continued to experience depression, occasional pain and paralysis of his limbs but wrote in a more cheerful tone to Dr. Hagemann at the end of July: \\"I wish to remain in the world and for the world. The high mountains here will help me\\". The summer was very productive despite Kirchner's illness. He finished some important pieces during the two month, such as \\"View of the Church in Monstein\\" and \\"Rising Moon in the Stafelalp\\". Together with 11 woodcuts, these works marked the start of Kirchner's Alpine life. Kirchner was then admitted to The Bellevue Sanatorium, run by Ludwig Binswanger, in Kreuzlingen where he continued to produce paintings and woodcuts. In 1918, Kirchner was given a residence permit and he moved to \\"In den L√§rchen\\" in Frauenkirch Davos where he rented a room on the first floor and eventually the above rooms in 1919, which he decorated with furniture that he carved. He wrote of the house to Henry van de Velde: \\"I‚Äôm living in a beautiful old Grisons house with a kitchen that looks like Rembrandt‚Äôs studio\\". Kirchner overcame his illness and, although he was still dependent on morphine, his doctor was slowly decreasing his doses. He also writes \\"A Painter's Credo\\" where he states: \\"There is an intellectual guardianship over the world, it is man‚Ä¶. This is the last judgement, before them you stand‚Ä¶.. They help you when you work. You can thank them only through work. When you want to die, they sometimes appear to you. When you are completely empty and completely open, you belong to them\\".Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Davoser Tagebuch Erna Schilling, his life partner, visited him periodically in Frauenkirch, while also maintaining a residence in Berlin to take care of Kirchner's business there. B√∂hmischer Waldsee (Bohemian Forest Lake), 1911, Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich Street, Berlin (1913), one of a series on this theme, depicting prostitutes, Museum of Modern Art Kirchner continued to work through 1919 and 1920 as his health also rapidly improved. His reputation grew with several exhibitions in Germany and Switzerland in 1920. He was provided with many subjects to paint as he came to know the farmers of the area, who were amazed by Kirchner's gramophone. Kirchner writes of the people of Davos: \\"The people who live here are proud. The hard work, which is done with great love, the way they treat animals (you very seldom see an animal being mishandled) entitle them to be proud. In most cases, work here has reached the ideal standard of being done with love. You can see it in the movements of their hands. And that, in turn, ennobles the facial expression and imbues all personal contacts with a great delicacy. This is a country in which democracy has become reality. Here a man‚Äôs word still counts, and you need have no fears about sleeping with your doors open. I am so happy to be allowed to be here, and through hard work I should like to thank the people for the kindness they have shown me\\". Kirchner began writing critiques of his own art under the pseudonym of Louis de Marsalle in order to control public opinion of him and free himself of dependence upon the art critics of the day. In 1921, there was a major display of Kirchner's work in Berlin; the reviews were favourable. Kirchner's father died on the 14 February. Kirchner visited Zurich at the beginning of May and met the dancer, Nina Hard, whom he invited back to Frauenkirch (despite Erna's objections). Nina Hard would become an important model for Kirchner and would be featured in many of his works. Kirchner began creating designs for carpets which were then woven by Lise Gujer. SERTIG VALLEY IN AUTUMN, 1925 BY ERNST LUDWIG KIRCHNER (1880-1938, GERMANY) In 1923, Kirchner moved to the Wildboden house, writing in his diary: \\"Our new little house is a real joy to us. We shall live here comfortably and in great new order. This will really come to be a turning point of my life. Everything must be put in clear order and the little house furnished as simply and modestly as possible, while still being beautiful and intimate\\". The house looked over Frauenkirch and the Stafelalp on one side and on the other, Davos and Kirchner used these landscapes as subjects for many of his paintings. Davos in Summer, 1925, Kirchner Museum Davos in Davos In 1925, Kirchner became close friends with fellow artist, Albert M√ºller and his family. Rot-Blau, a new art group based in Basle, was formed by Hermann Scherer, Albert M√ºller, Paul Camenisch and Hans Schiess, who all visited Kirchner and worked under his guidance. At the end of 1925, Kirchner returned to Germany and made his rounds to Frankfurt, Chemnitz (where his mother was living), and Berlin where he met with Karl Schmidt-Rottluff who wanted Kirchner to form a new artist's group; Kirchner politely refused. He then returned to Frauenkirch and wrote to Dr. Hageman on 26 March 1926: \\"Now I‚Äôm sitting quietly at home again and I‚Äôm happy to be able to work undisturbed. I made a lot of sketches of life in Germany and it was very intriguing to see life there. I was also glad to see the old pictures of Rembrandt, D√ºrer, etc. again and to have the confirmation and encouragement they gave me. As for the moderns, I saw damned little that gripped me\\". In December 1926, Kirchner's close friend, Albert M√ºller, died of typhus along with his wife, Anni M√ºller. In 1927, Kirchner organized a memorial exhibition for Albert M√ºller at the Kunsthalle Basel. There was a major exhibition of Kirchner's work at the schoolhouse in Davos; the reviews were positive. Kirchner continued to work in Frauenkirch, his style growing increasingly abstract. In 1929, Kirchner was forced to distance himself from Rot-Blau after they pledged allegiance to him, which upset Kirchner greatly. He addressed them in \\"An open letter to the Basle Red-Blue group\\" in No. 5 of Das Kunstbaltt, where stated that he was not their patron. In the same year, Kirchner visited Zurich, Berlin, and Essen. He was also visited in Frauenkirch by the painter Fritz Winter. In 1930, Kirchner began to experience health problems due to smoking and in 1931 Erna had to undergo surgery in Berlin due to a suspected growth. In 1931, he was made a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin. As the Nazi party took power in Germany, it became impossible for Kirchner to sell his paintings. In 1937, he was forced to resign from the Prussian Academy of Arts. Kirchner became increasingly disturbed by the situation in Germany, writing: \\"Here we have been hearing terrible rumours about torture of the Jews, but it‚Äôs all surely untrue. I‚Äôm a little tired and sad about the situation up there. There is a war in the air. In the museums, the hard-won cultural achievements of the last 20 years are being destroyed, and yet the reason why we founded the Br√ºcke was to encourage truly German art, made in Germany. And now it is supposed to be un-German. Dear God. It does upset me\\". Archers, 1935‚Äì1937, Kirchner Museum Davos in Davos In 1934, Kirchner visited Berne and Zurich, finding the former more pleasing than the latter, and met Paul Klee. In the winter of 1935, a new school was being planned to be built in Frauenkirch and Kirchner offered to paint a mural. This project was dropped and instead Kirchner created a sculpture to be placed above the door of the schoolhouse. Reflecting on the inauguration of the schoolhouse in 1936 he writes, \\"the new school was inaugurated yesterday. It was a celebration with songs, dancing and speeches, followed by drinking such as I have not seen or experienced in decades...They made a point of including me and so there I was, sitting once again amongst these people who had received me with such kindness and friendliness on the alp twenty years ago. The relief has found favour and was mentioned often in the speeches\\". Throughout 1936 and 1937, Kirchner began to experience health problems and was prescribed Ovaltine and Eukodal by his doctors. In 1937, the Degenerate Art Exhibition took place in Germany; a total of 639 works by Kirchner were taken out of museums and 25 were displayed in the exhibition. The Academy of Arts in Berlin expelled Kirchner as a member. Kirchner continued to work and organised a major exhibit in Basle, which received mixed reviews. Throughout 1938, Kirchner became increasingly upset with the situation in Germany. After Austria was annexed by Germany in the Anschluss, Kirchner became disturbed by the idea that Germany might invade Switzerland. On 15 June 1938, Kirchner took his own life by gunshot in front of his home in Frauenkirch. Three days later, Kirchner was laid to rest in the Waldfriedhof cemetery. Erna continued to live in the house until her death in 1945. Legacy In 1913, the first public showing in the United States of Kirchner's work took place at the Armory Show, which was also the first major display of modern art in America.\\"Ernst Ludwig Kirchner\\" , National Gallery of Art, USA. Retrieved 8 September 2007. In 1921, U.S. museums began to acquire his work and did so increasingly thereafter. His first solo museum show in the US was at the Detroit Institute of Arts in 1937.

Boston: Museum of Fine Arts In 1992, the National Gallery of Art, Washington, held a monographic show, using its existing collection; a major international loan exhibition took place in 2003. In November 2006 at Christie's, Kirchner's Street Scene, Berlin (1913) fetched $38 million, a record for the artist. From 3 August to 10 November 2008, the Museum of Modern Art in New York held a major exhibition that \\"probably comprises the very best of his oeuvre.\\"Buruma, Desire in Berlin, p. 19.

It is situated in the southern dock system, connected to Canning Dock to the north, Wapping Dock via Wapping Basin to the south and Albert Dock to the west. History Designed by Thomas Steers and being built from 1734, Salthouse Dock was completed after his death by Henry Berry, opening in 1753. The dock was originally known as South Dock, the name changing because it was nearby to John Blackburne's saltworks. As is indicative of its name, the dock was an important transit terminal for the salt industry. Liverpool was a base for the refining of rock salt from Cheshire and its onward transportation. The dock also handled agricultural produce from Ireland and the Mediterranean. Around 1769, John Okill had a shipyard on the south side. British Empire Dockyards and Ports, 1909 Structural improvements were made to the dock basin in 1842 and 1855. The opening of the Albert Dock in 1846 allowed vessels to be unloaded there, before moving on to the Salthouse Dock for loading. By the mid-19th century, the main trade from the dock was with China and the East Indies. The dock served square rigged sailing ships until about 1914. Custom House railway station, on the Liverpool Overhead Railway, was opened at the north-east corner of the dock in 1893. The station, opened at the same time as the railway, was renamed Canning in 1947 and closed in 1956 along with the railway. By 1920, the Wapping and Salthouse Goods Depot of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway was on the eastern side of the dock. A Royal Navy training ship, HMS Eagle, was based at Salthouse Dock from the end of the 19th century. This was originally a wooden vessel, which was renamed HMS Eaglet in 1918 and replaced in 1927. The following vessel survived until 1972. In 1934, the dock had warehousing along all four quays. The dock closed in 1972. =After closure= After the closure of Salthouse Dock, the dock silted up during the following decade and the quayside was in a state of considerable dereliction by 1980. At this point, transit sheds still remained on the east and west sides of the dock, with a former lifeboat training school also present at the north end of the western quay. In 1981, the Merseyside Development Corporation was established to rejuvenate the South Docks, and the dock was dredged between 1981-5. During the 1980s, direct access from Canning Dock was removed with the entrance being filled in, and a permanent roadway and slipway installed. Swing bridges, which were across the Albert Dock and Wapping Basin entrances, were also replaced with fixed structures. Narrowboats at the mooring in Salthouse Dock. The remaining transit shed gable end is to the mid- left, across the dock. Liverpool Cathedral is the tallest building in the background, beyond. The Wapping Warehouse is the long building in the mid- right background. By 2005, the dock had gained a significant marine biodiversity, including jellyfish, mussels, sponges and seaweed. Non-native marine wildlife found in the vicinity included giant snails, Korean sea squirts and Australasian barnacles. Until 2013, Yellow Duckmarines were used in the dock as a tourist attraction. On 30 March and 15 June 2013, these amphibious vehicles sank in the dock, which resulted in the withdrawal of licensing for the vehicles. Present Salthouse Dock is the oldest existing dock in Liverpool, and some of the masonry in the south-west corner of the dock is from the original construction. The dock walls are Grade II listed. A granite stone gable and arch entrance survives at the south east corner of the dock, from a transit shed built by Jesse Hartley. Following the completion of the Liverpool Canal Link in 2009, Salthouse Dock is on the route of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal extension to Liverpool Marina at Brunswick and Coburg Docks. The waterspace of this and the other docks in the southern system was owned by British Waterways from 2003 to 2012, now transferred to the Canal & River Trust. Salthouse Dock has pontoon moorings for small watercraft.

His contemporaries often called him the Russian Canaletto, in recognition of his masterful vedute.RusArtNet: Biography  Biography He was the son of the caretaker at the Imperial Academy of Arts, where he was admitted in 1764 upon a petition by his father, after studying for several years at the garrison school. In 1767, he took a class in ornamental sculpture and later studied scenic painting with Antonio Peresinotti. From 1773 to 1777, he lived in Venice on a fellowship, where he studied to be a theater artist. This did not appeal to him, however, and he spent much of his time painting landscapes and copying the old masters.ArtOnline: Biography Having incurred the displeasure of the authorities at the Academy, when he returned he was put to work as a decorator for the Imperial Theatres until 1786 and was not allowed to continue his academic studies. Undaunted, he continued to paint what he pleased and slowly won some recognition. In 1794, his \\"View of the Palace Embankment from the Fortress\\" earned him the title of Academician. In 1800, Tsar Paul I assigned him to create vedute of the streets and architecture in Moscow. From 1803, he taught at the Academy, but also travelled extensively, visiting Kherson, Mykolaiv, Bakhchysarai, Oryol and other locations in the south which had been visited by Catherine the Great, where he produced plein air sketches and watercolors of the surrounding areas. In 1810, he produced a series of works depicting Saint Petersburg. In his later years, his fame steadily declined and he died in poverty, leaving a large family behind.

This new information has resulted in the ordinals in subsequent Saltoun Lords being revised. As a result, Flora Fraser is sometimes listed as the 20th Lady Saltoun. (born 18 October 1930) is a Scottish peer. Until her retirement on 12 December 2014, she was the only holder of a lordship of Parliament who had a seat in the House of Lords as an elected hereditary peer. Lady Saltoun is the Chief of the Name and Arms of Clan Fraser since 1 May 1984, by decree of the Court of the Lord Lyon. She is also the head of the Scottish lowland family the Frasers of Philorth.  Biography  Flora Fraser was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, as the daughter of Alexander Fraser and Dorothy Geraldine Welby. Her maternal grandfather was Charles Glynne Earle Welby, 5th Baronet. She had an elder brother, Alexander Simon Fraser, Master of Saltoun. In 1933, her father became the 20th Lord Saltoun and she was styled the Hon. Flora Fraser. Her brother received the Military Cross and was killed in action in March 1944 while serving with the Grenadier Guards, making Flora heir presumptive to the Lordship. In 1979, when Lord Saltoun died, Flora became the 21st Lady Saltoun, and also gained a seat in the House of Lords. In 1999, because of the House of Lords Act 1999, 662 hereditary peers were removed from the House. However, Lady Saltoun was one of the ninety hereditary peers who were elected to remain in the House. On 6 October 1956 at Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire, Lady Saltoun married Alexander Ramsay of Mar (1919‚Äì2000), a grandson of Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, keeping her maiden surname after marriage.

The piece is based upon the Shepard scale concept, named after Tenney's colleague at Bell Labs psychologist Roger Shepard, though the technique which the piece uses is more properly described as a continuous Risset scale or Shepard-Risset glissando . Each rising sine-wave-like glissando, between twelve and fifteen rising at any time, fades in and out, all entering a minor sixth below their predecessors, rising from the infrasonic to ultrasonic range, from below to above the ability to perceive pitch . While the original experiments were intended to illustrate a property of human perception, Tenney's piece problematizes it: One simultaneously perceives the lines as forming one continuously rising line, yet one is constantly aware of shifts in perception from line to line or lines. According to reviewer Jeremy Grimshaw, \\"there emerges at the upper frequency threshold a crystalline conglomeration of extremely high pitches, which glimmer as an indistinguishable mass even as glissandi continually enter the top range and fade\\" According to his friend Philip Corner For Ann (rising), \\"must be optimistic!

The site is the largest prehistoric hilltop enclosure in the United States with three and one-half miles (18,000 ft) of walls in a complex. Built by the Hopewell culture, who lived in the area from the 200 BC to AD 400, the site is situated on a wooded bluff above the Little Miami. It is the namesake of a culture known as Fort Ancient who lived near the complex long after it was constructed. Maintained as a state historical park, the site was designated a National Historic Landmark for its significance. The State of Ohio purchased the land and made it Ohio's first state park in 1891. In addition, this is part of the Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks, one of 14 sites nominated in January 2008 by the U.S. Department of the Interior for potential submission by the United States to the UNESCO World Heritage List.\\"Secretary Kempthorne Selects New U.S. World Heritage Tentative List\\", Dept. of Interior (posted by Octagonmoonrise), 22 Jan 2008, accessed 5 Dec 2008 Construction The Fort Ancient earthworks were built in at least three stages over an estimated 400-year period.

Archaeologists estimate the total volume of earth in the walls at .  Archaeological Research  In 1809 the Philadelphia Port Folio published the first map and description of Fort Ancient.

The site was visited and surveyed in by John Locke in 1843. In Edwin Hamilton Davis and Ephraim George Squier's Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley, they described Fort Ancient as \\"one of the most extensive, if not the most extensive, work...in the entire West\\", regarding its size. Warren K. Moorehead conducted some of the initial excavations at Fort Ancient in 1887 and published his research in 1891 in the book Fort Ancient: Great Prehistoric Warren County Ohio.Moorehead, Warren K.

Ms. on file, Ohio Historical Society, Columbus More contemporary research includes the following: * From 1982 until her untimely death in 1991, Patricia Essenpreis conducted a series of excavations that included the re-excavation and examination of embankment wall cuts conducted by Richard Morgan. These excavations demonstrated that the embankment walls were built in multiple stages and that post structures were documented at the base of the walls. She also examined the Gateway 13 exterior spur where she found evidence of bladelet manufacturing. Her final project involved the excavation of a pavement and structure on the exterior of the earthworks near the Twin Mound complex. Here, she documented a three-level limestone pavement with household or domestic activity at the lowest level. * From 1987 through 2006, Robert Connolly collaborated with and then continued the research projects initiated by Patricia Essenpreis. His initial work involved taking Essenpreis's \\"canons of construction\\" to develop an \\"architectural grammar\\" of earthwork elements, demonstrating their intentional and precise placement throughout the Fort Ancient complex.Connolly, Robert (1998) The Architectural Grammar of Middle Woodland Hilltop Enclosures: Fort Ancient as a Case Study. In Ancient Earthen Enclosures of the Eastern Woodlands, edited by Lynne Sullivan and Robert Mainfort, University Press of Florida, Gainesville. In 1995 and 1996 Connolly directed the investigation of embankment walls and a large interior space of the North Fort of the earthwork in advance of a new museum construction. The embankment wall excavation confirmed Essenpreis' conclusion of multiple construction levels, but added a level of complexity in alternate basket loads of different soils in the construction, many features below the embankment wall, and a three-level limestone pavement on the exterior of the wall that contained a cache of burnt animal bones. Excavation in the North Fort interior space revealed the presence of 10 habitation structures. * Beginning in 2006, Robert Riordan conducted excavations in the North Fort of the earthwork complex that revealed a complex series of posts and activity areas, some with intense burning. Riordan named the Moorehead Circle after the archaeologist who conducted early excavations at the site. Purpose 1843 Map of the earthworks at Fort Ancient included in Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley. Some archaeologists originally thought the site was created to provide shelter against enemies. However, that interpretation is now discounted as the site presents anomalies inconsistent with defensive use such as: * Ditches are located inside the walls, rather than outside as a means of defense. * The 84 gateway openings in the walls could not have been defended in case of attack. * Evidence has not been found for the number of occupants necessary for a significant defense force. Based on the total corpus of archaeological research, the current functional interpretation is that the walls were designed for social, economic, political and ceremonial purposes.Connolly, Robert (2004) Time, Space, and Function at Fort Ancient.

The southwest mound of the four is interpreted to have functioned as a point that aligned with gateway openings in the embankment walls to mark significant solar and lunar events.Essenpreis, Patricia and David Duszynski (1989) Possible Astronomical Alignments at the Fort Ancient Monument.

The Historic Era Fort Ancient Village Stone building from 1802 operated as the Cross Keys Tavern from 1809-1820In the 1800s to early 1900s a village existed on the eastern bank of the Little Miami River, at the base of the Fort Ancient Earthworks. The village once had a post office (1846), hotel, blacksmith shop and other businesses and residences. The village no longer exists, but is currently the home of a canoe livery and a private campground. In the 19th century, Fort Ancient was a stop on the Little Miami Railroad. A historic tavern called the Cross Keys Tavern remains on the west bank of the Little Miami River and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The area is currently a public access to the Little Miami Bike Trail, which occupies the former railway land that follows the River. There is a public access and parking for the Little Miami River at the site.

The Tenth Army was a field army of the British Army during the Second World War created in Iraq and formed from the major part of \\"Paiforce\\" (Persia and Iraq Force). It was active in 1942 and 1943, and then disbanded. In April 1941 British and Indian troops had been deployed to Iraq from India under the command of Lieutenant- General Sir Edward P. Quinan to protect British interests, in particular oil concessions, after a coup d'etat had brought to power a government sympathetic to the Axis powers. The force was known as Iraqforce and was engaged in the Anglo-Iraqi War which took place in April and May Iraqi rebellion and took part in the defeat of the Vichy forces in the subsequent Syria-Lebanon campaign. Later in 1941, the force took part in the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran to prevent the Axis elements from entering Persia, and preventing the possibility of the Germans gaining control of the Iraqi and Persian oil fields. Following this Iraqforce was renamed Paiforce (Persia and Iraq force). After the campaigns of 1941, Quinan's headquarters was redesignated Tenth Army and its main task was the maintenance of the lines of communication to the Soviet Union from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian and the protection of the South Persian and Iraqi oilfields. Its badge was a golden Assyrian Ox with human head and eagle's wings (a Cherub Guardian). A variation of colouring of this badge was a white Ox on a pale blue background. Quinan was knighted in June 1942 and in August 1942, he was promoted to be a full general.

He is the father of former major league player Daryle Ward. Playing career Ward was signed by Minnesota as an amateur free agent in 1972 and made his major league debut late the 1979 season when he played in 10 games for the Twins. He also played 13 games for the Twins late in the 1980 season. On September 18, 1980, Ward became the sixth Twins player to hit for the cycle, doing so in the first game of a doubleheader against the Milwaukee Brewers at Milwaukee County Stadium. Ward's cycle came in the 14th game of his career, which still stands as the Major League record for fewest games played until hitting for the cycle. On May 13, 2007, while playing for the San Francisco Giants, Fred Lewis hit for the cycle in the 16th game of his Major League career, narrowly missing Ward's mark. Ward with two fans in 1985 Ward was named American League Rookie of the Year by Baseball Digest in 1981, and he also was named Twins Player of the Year and Most Improved Player in 1982. That season, he batted .289, with 28 home runs, 91 runs batted in, and a .519 slugging average. In 1983, he hit .278 with 19 HR and 88 RBI, and he led all outfielders with 24 assists‚Äîthe most for an American League outfielder since 1944. He was traded to the Rangers at the end of the season. In his first season with Texas, Ward hit .284 with 21 HR and 79 RBI, and he set a club season record with 7 triples and a personal high of 97 runs scored. He led the Rangers in batting in 1985 and 1986 (.287 and .316, respectively), and then signed with the Yankees as a free agent. He had a great first half in 1987, but he slumped badly in the second half of the season. For the following two seasons, he was a part-time player; he was released by the Yankees in mid-1989 and was signed by Detroit shortly thereafter. He finished his career with Detroit in 1990.

It was built by William Fermor, 1st Baron Leominster (1648‚Äì1711), in the Baroque style to the design of the architect Nicholas Hawksmoor.Kerry Downes, \\"Hawksmoor's house at Easton Neston\\", Architectural History 30 (1987).; Howard Colvin, A Biographical Dictionary of British Architects, 1600‚Äì1840, 3rd ed. (Yale University Press), 1995, s.v. \\"Hawksmoor, Nicholas\\". Easton Neston is thought to be the only mansion which was solely the work of Hawksmoor. From about 1700, after the completion of Easton Neston, Hawksmoor worked with Sir John Vanbrugh on many buildings, including Castle Howard and Blenheim Palace, and often provided technical knowledge to the less qualified Vanbrugh. Hawksmoor's work was always more classically severe than Vanbrugh's. However, Easton Neston predates this partnership by some six years. Architect A proposal for Easton Neston published in Vitruvius Britannicus, i (1715). The central block had been built in accordance with the proposal, except that the cupola was not added to the roof. The flanking wings, the gateway and the forecourt walls shown here were not built. Hawksmoor was commissioned to re-build the old manor house at Easton Neston by Sir William Fermor, later created Baron Leominster, who had inherited the estate from his father Sir William Fermor, 1st Baronet (1621‚Äì1661), who had himself inherited it in 1640 and had been created a baronet the following year by King Charles I. Hawksmoor had been recommended to Fermor by his cousin by marriage Sir Christopher Wren,May 2005 auction at Sotheby's. Accessed 26 May 2011 who in about 1680 had advised on the building of a new mansion on the site. No details of what Wren envisaged survive, and work seems to have ceased following completion of the two service blocks, of which only one survives. Following Fermor's marriage in 1692 to the wealthy heiress Catherine Poulett, he decided to resurrect the idea of a new mansion, and subsequently Wren's pupil Hawksmoor received the commission in about 1694. A 300-word letter written and signed by Wren in about 1685 survives, offering advice concerning the construction of Easton Neston. It was offered for sale at auction on 29 March 2011 with an estimate of ¬£9,000, and sold for ¬£19,200.Christopher Wren's Easton Neston letter up for sale for ¬£9,000, Northampton Chronicle & Echo, 13 March 2011Rare letter sells for ¬£19,200, Salisbury Journal ‚Äì includes copy of the letter ‚Äì 31 March 2011 In May 2011 a television programme featuring Easton Neston, by the British architectural historian Dan Cruickshank, in the series The Country House Revealed, was broadcast by the BBC.BBC i-player accessed 26 May 2011 This raised the question of whether Wren or Hawksmoor designed the building. Cruickshank obtained samples of wood from the building's roof and date tests revealed them as having originated from trees which were cut down between 1700 and 1701, which was proposed as proof that Hawksmoor was the architect, not Wren. Exterior South entrance lodges, Easton Neston, on the Old Towcester Road, with the estate and the tree-lined River Tove visible in the background Fermor had purchased a large collection of marble statues from the Arundel collection some of which he used to decorate the estate. These were removed and sold together with other items by George Fermor, 2nd Earl of Pomfret (1722‚Äì1785) (son of the 1st Earl), then in financial difficulties, and were bought by his mother Henrietta Jeffreys, daughter of John Jeffreys, 2nd Baron Jeffreys of Wem, who in 1755 donated them to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.The Country House Revealed. BBC i-player accessed 26 May 2011 The house Hawksmoor built at Easton Neston can best be described as a miniature palace that owes the colossal order of pilasters and crowning balustrade to the proposed design by Gabriel of the Petit Trianon at Versailles, which building was not completed until about 50 years after Easton Neston, engravings of which design were published in Vitruvius Britannicus. Gabriel's design was itself influenced by the palazzi on the Campidoglio in Rome by Michelangelo (d.1564). Both main fa√ßades of Easton Neston are of simple design, devoid of ostentation. The rectangular house comprises three principal floors. The lowest is a rusticated basement, above ground level, with the two floors above appearing to have equal value‚Äînine bays divided by Composite pilasters, each bay containing a tall, slim sash window of the same height on each floor. The central bay contains the entrance, flanked by two Composite full columns. These two columns support a small, round-headed pediment displaying the Fermor arms and heraldic motto. Above the door at second floor height is a massive Venetian window. The roof-line is concealed by a balustrade which is decorated by covered stone urns at the ten intervals above the pilasters below. The design and fenestration of the entrance fa√ßade is repeated at the rear on the garden fa√ßade, except that the roof balustrade at the rear is undecorated by urns and pediment. The house is built of Helmdon stone, a cream stone of exceptional quality, which has ensured that the carving appears as crisp today as it was on completion of the house in 1702. The two side elevations of the house tell the story of life in a country house before the age of the servants' bell. Until the invention of the remote bell situated in the servants' hall, which could be jangled by a system of ropes and pulleys from far away, it was necessary for servants to be located within earshot of a hand-bell or call of the voice. In older houses such as Montacute House servants slept on the floor of the great hall or outside the door of their master's bedchamber; by the 17th century this arrangement was becoming undesirable. Houses then began to have corridors, and the owners, rather than stepping over sleeping servants, began to tidy them away in small rooms, sometimes containing their employer's close-stool. However, these small rooms still had to be within calling distance. In a brand-new, luxurious house such as Easton Neston, this was achieved by inserting two very low-ceilinged mezzanine staff floors between each of the two upper floors. Hence at Easton Neston, while the two principal fa√ßades (West and East) are of three floors, the fenestration of the two less important side fa√ßades betrays the secret that there are in fact five floors: the windows of the two mezzanines, as befits the humble rooms they light, are a mere half of the size of those of the grander rooms above and below them. This makes the fenestration of the side fa√ßades a complex and interesting sight. Some years after completion of the house in 1702, Hawksmoor drew-up further plans for a huge entrance court. These designs, never fully executed but published in Vitruvius Britannicus, would have flanked the existing rectangular house with two wings, one containing stables and the other service rooms. The fourth (entrance) side of the courtyard was to have been an elaborate colonnade. No substantial part of this later scheme was built, except for two large and now decayed Ozymandian entrance piers, marooned in the park. The two pre-existing red-brick wings (themselves perhaps owing something to Christopher Wren) remained, although the western (stable) wing was later demolished after the new stables were built. Some architectural commentators, including Dan Cruickshank feel that Hawksmoor's mansion might have been spoilt by this new scheme, which owed more to Sir John Vanbrugh's architectural concepts than to Hawksmoor's. The whole proposed new design was depicted in Colen Campbell's 1715 work Vitruvius Britannicus,Vitruvius Britannicus, vol. i, 1715, pls 98 ‚Äì 100 as though it had in fact been built. Interior The principal rooms have windows rising almost from the floor to the ceiling. The rooms are large and well proportioned without suffering from the oppressive grandeur that was to be a feature of Vanbrugh and Hawksmoor's later collaborative work. The massive main staircase, with its wrought iron balustrade in the style of Jean Tijou, comprises two long, shallow flights ascending to the first floor gallery which is decorated with grisailles painted by Sir James Thornhill. Interiors at Easton Neston have suffered various changes since Hawksmoor completed the house. Hawksmoor's great hall, with its high, bare walls and flanking vestibules and Corinthian columns, was sub-divided in the 19th century by Sir Thomas Hesketh, who inherited the property from his uncle, to create an upper storey containing three bedrooms. The principal drawing room, the only heavily decorated room in the house, has also seen change in the form of decorative plasterwork carried out by Artari in the mid-18th century for Thomas Fermor, 1st Earl of Pomfret (1698‚Äì1753), comprising a high-relief ceiling matched on the walls by huge scrolled panels and picture surrounds, with trophies containing hunting emblems. Gardens In the park, Hawksmoor also designed a canal to complement the house, known as the Long Water; this is on an axis with the entrance door at the centre of the garden fa√ßade. In the 20th century the gardens overlooked by the west, or garden fa√ßade, were further enhanced by the creation of a water terrace, by Thomas Fermor-Hesketh, 1st Baron Hesketh (1881‚Äì1944), the great-nephew of the 5th and last Earl of Pomfret. It is decorated by box topiary and roses surrounding a large pool, which reflects the house in its water. Historical For the major part of its existence, including into the 21st century, Easton Neston has been a private house and never opened to the public; as a consequence it is little known. In March 1876 Empress Elisabeth of Austria visited England and rented Easton Neston House, using its fine stables for her horses. She used Blisworth railway station for travel to London.Empress of Austria ‚Äì Her visits to Easton Neston from mkheritage.co.uk The Easton Neston Gate at Towcester Racecourse The Easton Neston Gate at Towcester Racecourse, showing the Fermor arms In 2004 Alexander Fermor-Hesketh, 3rd Baron Hesketh, a descendant of the builder via a female line, put the house, and the surrounding estate including Towcester Racecourse, up for sale for an asking price of ¬£50 million. He received no offers and consequently in 2005, he sold the estate piecemeal. A part of the estate, including the main house, some outlying buildings and of land, were sold for about ¬£15 million to Leon Max, a retail businessman and designer.Daily Telegraph 13 July 2005 Lord Hesketh subsequently sold off the farmland and the Gothic village of Hulcote, but retained ownership of Towcester Racecourse. Max plans to use the Wren-designed wing of the house as a headquarters for his European operations, and the Hawksmoor block as his personal residence.\\"Rag trade to riches\\" The Times 17 July 2005 The Hesketh Library The library at Easton Neston was formerly the home of a substantial collection of rare books and manuscripts, largely created by Frederick Fermor- Hesketh, 2nd Baron Hesketh. In 2006 the collection was deposited at the library of Lancaster University, the Hesketh family having its origins in Lancashire. However, these were subsequently withdrawn from the university. In 2010 the trustees of the 2nd Baron's will trust sold some of his books, manuscripts and letters at Sotheby's. Sources *Nigel Nicolson 1965.

The company was founded in 1969 and first specialized in buggies and off-road vehicles. Early models were fiberglass bodies installed on Volkswagen Beetle chassis and machinery, but VW bodies and chassis were later replaced by a unique solution made of Plasteel, which consists of fiberglass and steel joined together, a system patented by Gurgel. Gurgel also introduced Brazil's first fully domestically designed and manufactured car, the BR-800.  History  = Rise and growth (1969‚Äì1987) = A Gurgel SUV Gurgel G15 The Ipanema was the first car produced by Gurgel, introducing the brand in the market. The next model was the first commercial success of the brand: the Xavante (also named X-10): production started in 1973, being the first car of Gurgel developed using the Plasteel system, which was proved very resistant under corrosive environments and also very mechanically strong, deforming temporarily but not smashing under pressure or shocks. Xavante also had a feature called Selectraction, a system where two individual hand-brakes were installed next to the driver, for each one of the rear wheels. In a situation of low-traction environment, it could be used to stop a free-spinning wheel and move the power to the other one, allowing the driver to restore traction to the ground and to move along. There was a more sophisticated version of X-10 called X-12, which was the biggest commercial success of the brand. In 1974, the Itaipu was a pioneer project of an electric vehicle, which was developed to be a strict urban car for short distances. However, due to the limited technology of the batteries of that time ‚Äì they were too heavy and had low capacity ‚Äì the project was halted. Still, in 1980 another electric vehicle was conceived, called Itaipu E400: it was a van, still designed for urban travels, but making a better autonomy and still a remarkable mileage. The same body was also listed in brochures as available with a petrol engine, as the \\"G-800\\". In 1979, the X-15 was released, being a van which could carry 7 passengers, or 2 passengers plus 500 kg of load. A derived model, the G-15L, could carry 1 ton of load, having 70L of gasoline capacity, which could be extended to 140L, with an additional tank. At that time, business was going quite well: Gurgel was the first exporter in special vehicles, and the second in production and amount, in 1977 and 1978. In 1981, the XEF model was developed, having only three front seats, an unusual solution at the time. The car was an urban model, with small dimensions for the passengers and for the luggage. In 1984, the Caraj√°s model was introduced: it presented the same Selectraction system as Xavante and X-12, but had some special qualities, such as the TTS (Tork Tubing System), used to transfer the power from the engine, on the front of the vehicle, to the transmission, on the rear. The system gave a good weight balance for the system, but presented some collateral effects, such as the need for a slower shift change, due to the inertia of the TTS. = Urban vehicles (1987‚Äì1993) = Enertron engine, installed in the very first BR800 A small, economic, and totally national car was the goal for Jo√£o Gurgel for a long time. On September 7 of 1987, a day Gurgel himself called \\"the day of the Brazilian technological independence\\", the project CENAAcronym for \\"Carro Econ√¥mico NAcional\\", meaning \\"National Economic Car\\" in English. was presented. The first minicar of the brand was designed to be the cheaper and more economic car offered in the market. For this project, a tax benefit was granted, reducing the IPIAcronym for \\"Imposto sobre Produtos Industrializados\\", meaning \\"Tax over Industrialized Goods\\" in English. to 5%, aiming at increasing competitiveness with big automakers. Gurgel BR-800 The car presented a big step in the national technology development: the engine, named Gurgel Enertron, was entirely designed and developed by Gurgel, low cost : it was a bi-cylindrical engine, originally with 650 cc and 800 cc options, equipped with totally electronic ignition control, using a system with two coils and no distributor. It had a good mileage, making 14 km/L on urban traffic, and could achieve 19 km/L on the road, on constant speed, even without any electronic fuel injection. The engine was very similar to the VW Beetle boxer engine, even sharing some internal parts with it, but had many improvements: a sealed water-cooled system, better compression ratio and a different ignition system. Unlike the VW boxer, it could be taken to near 6000 rpm without any valve float. The first model based on the original project was the BR-800, available only with the 800 cc engine option, generating 32 PS of power. It was a direct implementation of the project, with minor changes and improvements. Like other vehicles from the brand, the car had a body made using the Plasteel system, weighing only 650 kg and measuring 3.19 meters, still being the smallest car ever produced in Brazil. It was first sold in 1988 in a system where the buyer had to acquire shares from Gurgel in order to buy the car. The car cost about US$5,000, but the buyer had to buy 750 shares for another US$5,000 in order to get a car, making it considerably more expensive than a US$7,000 Chevrolet Chevette, the then cheapest car in the Brazilian market. This system lasted until 1990, when the car was sold independently of the shares. In this same year, the federal government changed the rules to give the same reduction of the IPI to all cars below 1000 cc, thus enabling Gurgel's competitors to develop one-litre models of existing cars. In 1992, in a response to the market, the Supermini model was created: it had a better finish, more power (36 PS), a lot of improvement in the body, including a more robust suspension, a better system for the windows and a real lid for the trunk. = Last projects and bankruptcy (1993‚Äì1994) = When president Fernando Collor went to office in March, 1990, he soon opened the Brazilian market to foreign products. Even considering the high import taxes, national industry from the time suffered from the new external competition, and things weren't different for Gurgel. The Caraj√°s, which had been Brazil's best selling SUV, was taken out of production in early 1991 as the Lada Niva arrived in the Brazilian market. Gurgel Motomachine The president also extended the IPI reduction of Gurgel BR-800 to all vehicles below 1,000 cc. Fiat quickly responded by launching the Uno Mille, and other automakers soon followed with their own one-litre cars. This step was considered by many Gurgelistas a kind of betrayal from the government, as the prices of these vehicles was now very similar. In 1991 Gurgel released the Motomachine, a shortened two-seater roadster based on the BR-800. Only 177 of these were built in 1991. However, Gurgel had gained a lot of experience and feedback from the customers and investors during the BR-800 sales, and with that input in mind they started a new project called Gurgel Delta. This project was intended to be cheaper than the BR-800, aimed at the lower economic classes, being produced in a new plant near the target market: the northeast. Governors of state of Cear√° and S√£o Paulo signed a letter of intent in December 1991, where they confirmed interest to fund Gurgel in US$30 million and US$50 million each. BNDES would also join if both states confirmed the funding, adding US$25 million. By that time, Gurgel had already bought the ground of 650000 square meters, needed for the new factory facilities, and negotiated with Citro√´n the purchase of machinery used for 2CV production. However, in the following years of 1992 and 1993, the state of Cear√° did not confirm the funding, leading to the loss of support from S√£o Paulo and BNDES. The schedule for production of the new car was delayed, and in 1993 Gurgel entered in a preventive bankruptcy. Gurgel still tried to contact the federal government, making a presentation for the Delta project to the current president Itamar Franco. This presentation resulted in a technical note from the (now extinct) MICTAcronym for \\"Minist√©rio de Ind√∫stria, Com√©rcio e Turismo\\", which stands for \\"Ministry of Industri, Commerce and Tourism\\" in Englist. saying that \\"immediate actions needed to be taken\\", treating the matter as of \\"national interest\\". Still, no funding was conceived, and on March 1, 1994, Gurgel had it first collapse. The administration appealed, but it was already too late, and in the end of 1994 the doors were finally closed and locked. = Current days (2000 and beyond) = The trademark Gurgel expired, was bought by another business, and is now used by a small Brazilian importer of tricycles. The current Gurgel has nothing in common with the original Gurgel company, except the name. The vehicles produced by the original factory are still running on Brazilian roads nowadays. It is not uncommon to see X-12, Tocantins, Supermini or BR-800 models on the streets, despite of the reduced number of specialized workshops and lack of specific parts for replacement. Gurgel's founder and owner Jo√£o do Amaral Gurgel was born in 1926. A few years after Gurgel's bankruptcy, Jo√£o do Amaral Gurgel developed Alzheimer's disease. He died on January 30, 2009, in S√£o Paulo, due to complications from the disease.  Vehicles produced  * Gurgel Moplast: A very small vehicle, with fiberglass body. * Gurgel Ipanema: A dune buggy, bigger than Moplast, based on VW platform with fiberglass body. * Gurgel Xavante X10: With a new chassis made of fiberglass over a steel framework and VW Beetle engine and transmission, this small off-road car showed its dune buggy roots but with a more Jeep-like styling and intended usage. Some thousands produced in 1970 decade. Early models had more rounded, dune buggy-like lines, while later ones are more square and Jeep-like. * Gurgel Xavante X11: Similar to Xavante X10, but from late 1970 decade. Some thousands produced. * Gurgel Xavante X12: Also similar to Xavante X10. Some thousands produced in the 1980s. * Gurgel Itaipu: The first project for an electric car, still the only electric car ever produced in Brazilian history. First produced in 1973. Only a few of these tiny two-seater cars were produced and they were not sold since the car never developed pass the prototype stage. The car was named after a huge hydro power plant in the border of Brazil and Paraguay. * Gurgel Tocantins: An evolution of Xavante X12. Bigger motor, 4 X 2 and also with fiberglass chassis. It was a commercial success, exported to 40 countries. * Gurgel Caraj√°s: A large SUV powered by a 1.8 water-cooled engine from the Volkswagen Santana. The engine was mounted at the front, with rear transmission. The last Gurgel Caraj√°s was produced in January 1991. After the Caraj√°s, no more Gurgel SUVs were made. The rare Caraj√°s VIP has four doors. * Gurgel X15: A pick-up with a number of different body types, few units produced. The X 15 has a longer wheelbase but is otherwise similar. * Gurgel X20: Another pick-up, few units produced. * Gurgel E500: An electric-powered pickup/delivery van, with few units produced. * Gurgel G800: An internal combustion engine version of the E500, few units produced. * Gurgel XEF: City car shaped like a saloon, powered by Volkswagen's air-cooled 1.6 engine from the original Beetle. Only one hundred Gurgel XEF were made. It had an unusual three-occupant configuration, with each occupant sitting side-by-side. * Gurgel BR-800: City car built from 1988 to 1991. In order to buy one from the first lot, the customer had to acquire shares from the Gurgel brand, as a way to capitalize the factory. After 1990, the shares acquisition was no longer necessary. It sold reasonably well in 1989 and 1990, but sales dwindled in 1990 after IPI reduction of other cars in the segment. * Gurgel Supermini: The BR-800 evolution, built from 1991 to 1994. More improved and with better finish that BR-800. * Gurgel Motomachine: A smaller two-seat roadster version of the Supermini, only 177 were produced in 1991.

It is located in the north central part of the city within the former city of North York. The City of Toronto has officially designated the neighbourhood of Henry Farm to encompass a smaller neighbourhood, Parkway Forest, between Don Mills Road and Highway 404, which is covered in a separate article. The neighbourhood is served by the Henry Farm Community Interest Association. History Built in 1824, Oriole Lodge was amongst the first buildings built in the neighbourhood. Henry Farm was settled in 1806 by Henry Mulholland, a native of Clones, County Monaghan, Ireland. He later sold the farm, but his great-grandson, George Stewart Henry, reacquired it in 1898. Henry was the tenth Premier of Ontario from 1930-34. Ten days before his death in 1958, Henry sold his farm for C$2 million to the developers of the present-day neighbourhood. Henry's house, called Oriole Lodge, still stands as a private residence at 17 Manorpark Court. Henry Farm was developed into a housing subdivision in the 1960s. Most of the neighbourhood consists of low density suburban housing. Along the northeast and southeast are townhouse developments. The latter are primarily social housing. There are also two high-rise apartment buildings, Havenbrook Towers, at the southeast corner. There is one church, located at 80 George Henry Boulevard, which houses the St. Matthew the Apostle, Oriole Anglican Church of Canada congregation. The church was built in 1969 and dedicated on January 25, 1970. The site was shared with the Covenant United Church. Covenant United Church amalgamated with Donway United Church in 1992, and moved out of Henry Farm. Education The Toronto District School Board (TDSB) is a public school board that operates two elementary schools in Henry Farm, Forest Manor Public School, and Shaughnessy Public School. TDSB does not operate a secondary school in the neighbourhood, with TDSB students attending secondary schools in adjacent neighbourhoods. In addition to TDSB, three other public school board also offers schooling to residents of Don Mills, the Toronto Catholic District School Board (TCDSB), secular school board; and two French first language public school board, the secular Conseil scolaire Viamonde (CSV), and it separate counterpart, Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir (CSCM). However, none of the three school boards operate school in Don Mills, with CSCM, CSV, and TCDSB students attending schools situated in other neighbourhoods in Toronto. Recreation The neighbourhood is home to several municipal parks, including Havenbrook Park, and Parkway Forest Park. Havenbrook Park has a baseball diamond, toboggan hill and the Henry Farm Tennis Club, The Park is situated near the Don Valley, which forms a part of the larger Toronto ravine system. Municipal parks in Toronto are managed by the Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division. The division also manages a community centre in the neighbourhood, Parkway Forest Community Centre. Transportation TTC's Don Mills station on the south side of Sheppard Avenue. Several major thoroughfares bound the neighbourhood. Sheppard Avenue is a roadway that bounds Henry Farm in the north, while Highway 404 bounds the residential neighbourhood to the east. Highway 404 to provides access to York Region to the north and south to the Don Valley Parkway which starts at the 401/404 interchange just south of Sheppard Avenue. Highway 404 serves as a point of division between the primarily residential neighbourhood and the Consumers Business Park a commercial area to the east of the 404. The Business Park runs east to the Victoria Park Avenue. Highway 401 is the other major controlled access highway that bounds the neighbourhood from the south. The highway provides east-west access to the rest of Greater Toronto, and southern Ontario. The Don River's East Branch is the natural border to the west that passes under the Sheppard Avenue and Leslie Street intersection Public transportation in the neighbourhood is provided by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), operating several bus routes through the neighbourhood. In addition, the Toronto subway may be accessed from Don Mills station, located at Don Mills Road, and Sheppard Avenue. Access to bus routes operated by York Region Transit may also be accessed at Don Mills station.

They are believed to have spoken an East Germanic language. Their name probably means \\"the pure ones\\". The Scirii were mentioned already in the late 3rd century BC as participants in a raid on the city of Olbia near modern-day Odessa. In the late 4th century they lived somewhere north of the Black Sea and Lower Danube in the vicinity of the Goths. By the early 5th century, the Scirii had been subdued by the Huns, whom they fought under at the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains in 451 AD. After the death of Attila, the Scirii broke free from Hunnic rule at the Battle of Nedao in 454 AD. They subsequently were recorded holding their own kingdom north of the Middle Danube, under the leadership of Edeko and his son Onoulphus. After the destruction of this kingdom by the Ostrogoths in the late 460s AD, Odoacer, another son of Edeko, attained high status within the Roman army in Italy, ruling Scirii, Rugii and other non-Roman peoples as a king. Odoacer eventually made himself King of Italy in 476 AD, effectively ending the Western Roman Empire. Odoacer was in turn deposed and killed by Theodoric the Great in 493 AD. Along with the Rugii, Heruli and other Middle Danubian peoples, the Scirii might also have contributed to the formation of the Bavarii. Name Since the 19th century, the etymology of the Scirii name has been connected to such Germanic words as Gothic skeirs (\\"sheer\\", \\"pure\\"). Rudolf Much, in the first edition of the Reallexikon der Germanischen Altertumskunde pointed out that this could be interpreted three ways: \\"bright\\" (clari, splendidi), \\"honest\\" (candidi, sinceri) or \\"pure\\" and \\"unmixed\\", and he mentioned that the latter racial implication might make sense for a people living near a borderland.Hoops (ed.) RGA (1918-1919), \\"Skiren\\", Vol.4. which starts on page 191 In more recent times scholars such as Herwig Wolfram have often accepted this latter idea, interpreting the name Scirii to mean \\"the pure ones\\", and contrasting their name with that of the neighboring Bastarnae, who were ethnically mixed according to this interpretation, and thus, according to this account, named \\"the bastards\\". Not all scholars have accepted this. Robert L. Reynolds and Robert S. Lopez, for example, suggested an Iranian etymology for Scirii, relating it to the Middle Persian shƒ´r (\\"milk, lion\\"). This theory was dismissed by Otto J. Maenchen- Helfen.. \\"It would be difficult to suggest a more farfetched etymology.\\" responded that this represents \\"the position of the unflinching Germanizer, to whom it appears self-evident that every barbarian who distinguished himself must have been a German in his inner being\\". Language The Scirii are believed to have been Germanic-speaking.. \\"Sciri ‚Äì Germanic-speaking group...\\". \\"Sciri... Germanic-speaking group... In 1947, for example, Maenchen-Helfen argued that while Huns also often used Germanic names, all three known personal names of the leaders of the Scirii, the family of Odoacer, were Germanic, making the case stronger. However, it is commonly accepted by scholars since then that Odoacer's father was described in one classical source as a Hun, and that there are different ways of explaining his name. Some scholars thus propose that Odoacer's mother was his connection to the Scirii, while others feel that being called a Hun in one context did not make it impossible to be called something else in another, and that in any case it is likely that Odoacer had a \\"polyethnic\\" background. More specifically, the Scirii are believed to have spoken an East Germanic language like the Goths. Classification The Scirii are classified as a Germanic people by modern scholars.. \\"Sciri, Germanic tr.\\". \\"[T]hey have generally been taken to be a German people.\\" More specifically, they are frequently grouped together with the Goths, Vandals, Heruli, Rugii, Gepids and Burgundians as East Germanic peoples.. \\"East Germanic ones (Sciri, Heruli)... We may not forget the East Germanic Sciri... East Germanic peoples (Goths, Gepids, Vandals, Sciri, Rugii and more)...\\". \\"The Skirians lived on the middle Danube; they were an East Germanic people who were associated with the Bastarnae for a long time and the last remnants of them seem to have ended up in Bavaria.\\" In late Roman times, many East Germanic peoples, in addition to the non-Germanic Alans, were often referred to as \\"Gothic\\" peoples. On at least one occasion, Procopius included the Scirii in such a list, together with the Alans., Book V, I (=Gothic War, I, 1). The Scirii were not classified as Germanic in ancient sources. Reynolds and Lopez doubted that the Scirii were Germanic- language-speaking, and rather suggested that they might have been Balts or Sarmatians. These doubts were rejected by Maenchen-Helfen, who considered it certain that the Scirii were Germanic.. \\"Like the Heruli the Rugi were not \\"probably\\" (loc. cit., p. 43) but most certainly a Germanic tribe\\". \\"The Heruli and Rugians were Germans. So were the Scirians as proved by the names of their leaders.\\" History =Origins and early history= The Bastarnae, Scirii and Vandals are believed to have been present near the Vistula by the 3rd century BC. The Scirii were first mentioned in the Protogenes inscription of Olbia, which describes attacks upon the northern Black Sea coast by the \\"Galatians\\" and \\"Scirii\\" (ŒìŒ±ŒªŒ¨œÑŒ±œÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ£Œ∫ŒØœÅŒøœÖœÇ).; ; This inscription is dated to approximately 220‚Äì200 BC. The \\"Galatians\\" in this inscription are frequently identified as the Bastarnae, who are believed to have been a Germanic people with Celtic influences. It is thus believed that both the Bastarnae and Scirii had arrived in this area in the early 3rd century BC. The Bastarnae and Scirii are generally associated with the Poienesti-Lukasevka culture. Historian Roger Batty has also associated them with the Zarubintsy culture. The Scirii are not mentioned in the works of Julius Caesar or Tacitus. The 1st century Roman writer Pliny the Elder described the peoples inhabiting the region east of the Vistula, as the Sarmatians, Venedi, \\"Sciri\\" and Hirri., Book IV, Chap. 27 The Scirii are believed to have participated in the Gothic expansion towards the Black Sea in the 3rd century AD. Around 300 AD, the Verona List of \\"barbarians\\" living near the Roman Empire mentions the Scirii between the Sarmatians to the west and the Carpi to the east. Walter Goffart suggests that they lived in the Lower Danube valley. Peter Heather suggests that the Scirii lived east of the Carpathians in the 4th century, while Malcolm Todd suggests that they lived north of the Black Sea. =The Scirii under Hunnic rule= Territory under Hunnic control in 450 AD In the late 4th century AD, the Scirii were conquered by the Huns. In 381 AD a force of Scirii, Carpi and some Huns crossed the lower Danube into the Roman Empire. They were forced back by the emperor Theodosius. Sometime in the late 4th or early 5th century, the Scirii are believed to have moved westwards into the Middle Danube region. Here they formed part of a polity established by the Hunnic leader Uldin. In 409 AD the Scirii and Huns under Uldin crossed the Danube and invaded the Roman Balkans. They captured Castra Martis, but were eventually defeated and Uldin was killed. While the Hunnic prisoners were drafted into the Roman army, captured Scirii were enslaved and sent as coloni to Anatolia. The Scirii were a numerous people at this time, and the coloni were distributed over a widespread area in order to prevent them from revolting. These events are described in the Codex Theodosianus. During the height of the Hunnic empire under their leader Attila, the Scirii were subjects of Attila and provided potent infantry for him. Attila's empire included not only Huns and Scirii, but also Goths, Gepids, Thuringi, Rugii, Suebi, Heruli, Alans and Sarmatians. The Scirii participated in Attila's invasion of Gaul in 451 AD. As the Hunnic empire disintegrated, one group of Scirii were settled in the Roman empire in Scythia Minor and Lower Moesia south of the Lower Danube. Jordanes mentions four tribes that remained loyal to the Huns under Dengizich: Ultzinzures, Bittugures, Bardores and Angisciri. The last might be a Scirian remnant. The name Angisciri has been analyzed as Germanic for \\"grassland Sciri\\", but it may be an unrelated Turkic name since the other three names in the list are Turkic. =Independent kingdom= After the death of Attila, the Scirii, Heruli, Rugii and others joined Ardaric of the Gepids in a revolt against the Huns, winning a major victory at the Battle of Nedao in 454 AD.. In the aftermath, Edeko established a Scirian kingdom in the Middle Alf√∂ld between the Middle Danube and the Tisza rivers, which he ruled together with his sons Odoacer and Onoulphus. A man by the name of Edeko had previously been a trusted advisor of Attila, and this Edeko is generally believed to have been the same person as the one who established the Scirian kingdom.. \\"Maenchen-Helfen (1973)... denies the identity of the two Edecos, but it is generally accepted...\\". \\"[It] seems likely, the two Edecos are the same man...\\" Edeko had served at one point as Attila's envoy to Constantinople, and once prevented an assassination plot against him. Edeko was probably not a Scirian himself, but was married to a Scirian noblewoman. He is believed to have been either a Thuringian or a Hun, or perhaps of mixed Thuringian-Hunnic ancestry. A Thuringian origin of Edeko is attested by Malchus through the Suda, while a Hunnic origin of Edeko is attested by Priscus. Goffart refers to Edeko as a Hun. Heather considers a Thurungian origin more specific and thus more likely. The Thurungi were also a Germanic people. In the subsequent years the Scirii competed with neighboring Goths, Gepids, Suebi and others for supremacy over the region. Three graves at Bakodpuszta in Hungary has been identified with the Scirii. In the nearby Sarviz marshes a magnificent treasure has been discovered, and this treasure has been linked to Edeko. Jordanes reports that the Scirii were allies of the Ostrogoths, but were encouraged by Hunimund of the Suebi to break off this alliance. In the 460s AD, both the Scirii and the Ostrogoths sought an alliance with the Eastern Roman Empire. Against the advice of his general Aspar, Emperor Leo I decided to help the Scirii. In 468/469 AD the Scirii made a surprise attack on the Ostrogoths. Although the Ostrogothic king Valamir was killed in this conflict, the Scirii were defeated. Valamir was succeeded as king by Theodemir, who subsequently went on the offensive against the Scirii, who in turn received support from the Suebi, Heruli and Sarmatians. In the Battle of Bolia, the Ostrogoths defeated a coalition of Roman-supported peoples, including Scirii, Heruli, Suebi, Sarmatians, Gepids and Rugii. Jordanes reports that the Scirii were dealt a severe blow in their conflict with the Ostrogoths. =Later history= The kingdom of Odoacer in 480 AD After the destruction of the Scirian kingdom, Odoacer led most of the surviving Scirii, in addition to many Heruli and Rugii, into Italy to join the Roman army, which was controlled by Ricimer. Turcilingi are also reported as having been part of this group. Jordanes calls Odoacer king of the Turcilingi, and they have been interpreted as another East Germanic tribe and/or perhaps the royal family of the Scirii.. \\"Turcilingi, East Germanic tr. or/and Scirian royal family\\" Odoacer's brother Onoulphus went to Constantinople with other Scirii. Odoacer's group might have numbered 10,000 warriors, and came to play a prominent role in the Roman army and Roman politics. They were utilized by Ricimer in his conflict with Anthemius. In 476 AD, Odoacer led an uprising among the barbarian troops against Romulus Augustulus and the latter's father Orestes. Odoacer then declared himself king of Italy, thus ending the Western Roman Empire. He subsequently gained control over all of Italy. It is possible that Odoacer's uprising was organized in coordination with his brother Onoulphus in Constantinople. In 486 Onoulphus fell out of favor with Eastern Roman Emperor Zeno, and moved to Ravenna with his Scirian followers to join Odoacer. Soon afterwards, Zeno encouraged Theodoric the Great, king of the Ostrogoths, to invade Italy. After a bloody conflict, Theodoric emerged victorious. On March 15, 493, Theodoric murdered Odoacer with his own hands and established the Ostrogothic Kingdom. By this time the Scirii disappear from history. Remaining elements of the Scirii might have settled in modern- day Bavaria. Along with the Heruli and Rugii, the Scirii may have been one of the tribes which contributed to the formation of the Bavarii. Since the 19th century, the name of the Scirii has been detected in Bavarian placenames.Sch√ºtte cites Johann Andreas Schmeller, Bayerisches W√∂rterbuch, Vol.3 (1836) Wolfgang Haubrichs gives examples such as Scheyern (first attested as Scira in 1080), Scheuer (Sciri, c. 975), Scheuern in Neubeuern (Skira, 11th century) and perhaps Scheuring (Sciringen, 1150). These names are believed to designate these villages as Scirian, and it is proposed that the Scirii probably mediated the transfer of a few East Germanic lexical items to the Bavarian language, which otherwise shows no East Germanic influence. Culture Historians Reinhard Wenskus and Herwig Wolfram believe that Scirii prided themselves on their unmixed ancestry, and did not allow intermarriage, and that similar practices were followed by other Germanic peoples such as the Rugii and Juthungi.

Norman Collie, was an English scientist, mountaineer and explorer.  Life and work  He was born in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, the second of four sons to John Collie and Selina Mary Winkworth.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf In 1870 the family moved to Clifton, near Bristol, and John was educated initially at Windlesham in Surrey and then in 1873 at Charterhouse School. The family money had been made in the cotton trade, but in 1875 the American Civil War resulted in their financial ruin when their American stock was burnt. Collie had to leave Charterhouse and transfer to Clifton College, Bristol where he realised he was completely unsuited for the classics. He attended University College in Bristol and developed an interest in chemistry. He earned a PhD in chemistry under Johannes Wislicenus at W√ºrzburg in 1884. Returning to Britain, he taught three years at Cheltenham Ladies College where, according to his niece, \\"he was far from being a ladies' man and probably found that schoolgirls in bulk were rather more than he could stomach\\". quoting He left to join University College London (UCL) as an assistant to William Ramsay. His early work was the study of phosphonium and phosphine derivatives and allied ammonium compounds. Later he made important contributions to the knowledge of dehydracetic acid, describing a number of very remarkable 'condensations,' whereby it is converted into pyridine, orcinol and naphthalene derivatives. Collie served as Professor of Organic Chemistry at UCL from 1896 to 1913, and headed its chemistry department from 1913 to 1928.See the UCL Department of Chemistry page on Collie He performed important research that led to the taking of the first x-ray for diagnosing medical conditions. According to Bentley, Collie \\"worked with Ramsay on the inert gases, constructed the first neon lamp, proposed a dynamic structure for benzene, and discovered the first oxonium salt.\\" The work on neon discharge lamps was conducted in 1909. The effect of glowing neon in contact with mercury was later sometimes called the Collier effect. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1888. His proposers included Alexander Crum Brown and Edmund Albert Letts. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1896. Mountaineering Collie's professional career was spent as a scientist but his avocation was mountaineering. Among mountaineers, he is perhaps best remembered for his pioneering climbs on the Cuillin in the Isle of Skye, but he also climbed in the English Lake District and in the Alps with William Cecil Slingsby and Albert F. Mummery. Collie appears to have begun climbing in Skye in 1886. He went there with his brothers to fish but made an ascent of Sg√πrr nan Gillean. After two unsuccessful attempts he was given advice on the route by John Mackenzie, a Skye crofter and Britain's first professional mountain guide. Collie returned regularly to Skye and climbed with MacKenzie, the two men becoming firm friends and making many first ascents. In 1899 he discovered the Cioch, a unique rock feature on the Coire Laggan face of Sron na Ciche. This he climbed in 1906 with Mackenzie, who named it from the Gaelic word for a breast. Collie was instrumental in producing much better maps of the Cuillin which had previously defied the skills of cartographers. He is commemorated in the Cuillin by Sg√∫rr Thormaid (Norman's Peak; pronounced Skoor Horamitch)Ken Crocket, Mountaineering in Scotland : The Early Years,(Edinburgh: Scottish Mountaineering Trust, 2015) pp40-46 He is also remembered in Collie's Ledge, a famously exposed rocky scramble across the west face of Sg√πrr Mhic Choinnich, (MacKenzie's Peak) which is named after his great friend.S.P. Bull, Black Cuillin Ridge ; Scramblers' Guide, (Edinburgh: Scottish Mountaineering Trust,1993),77.Climbers on the Cioch, Isle of Skye Since the first traverse of this ledge was made by MacKenzie with the Irish climber, Henry Hart, rather than Collie himself, some authoritative publications have begun to use the name Hart's LedgeNoel Williams,Skye Scrambles,(Edinburgh: Scottish Mountaineering Trust,2017),250 In the 1997 BBC TV series on Scottish climbing, The Edge, Collie and MacKenzie's exploits were re-enacted by Alan Kimber (Collie) and John Lyall (MacKenzie) Norman Collie and John MacKenzie as old men Collie also made significant ascents on mainland Scotland, notably the first ascent and first winter ascent of Tower Ridge on Ben Nevis with Godfrey Solly and J. Collier on 29 March 1894. The ridge had one previous descent by the Hopkinsons in 1892.J.R. Marshall, Climbers' guide to Ben Nevis (Edinburgh: Scottish Mountaineering Trust,1969)94 In 1894 he also climbed the eponymous Collie's Pinnacle on Bidean nam Bian, Argyll's highest hill, by its short side. (10 metres, grade Easy)L.S. Lovat,Climbers Guide to Glencoe and Ardgour, Vol. 2(Edinburgh: W&R; Chambers for The Scottish Mountaineering Trust, 1965)p9 In 1895, Collie, Mummery, and fellow climber Geoffrey Hastings went to the Himalaya Range for the world's first attempt at a Himalayan 8,000-metre peak, Nanga Parbat. They were years ahead of their time, and the mountain claimed the first of its many victims: Mummery and two Gurkhas, Ragobir and Goman Singh were killed by an avalanche and never seen again. The story of this disastrous expedition is told in Collie's book, From the Himalaya to Skye. After gaining climbing experience on the Alps, the Caucasus and the Himalaya, in 1897 Collie joined the Appalachian Club upon the invitation of Charles Fay, and spent the summer climbing in the Canadian Rockies. From 1898 to 1911, Collie visited the Canadian Rockies five more times, accomplishing twenty-one first ascents and naming more than thirty peaks. He was particularly interested in locating and climbing the mythical giants of Hooker and Brown which had bordered the forgotten fur trade route through the Rockies and were reputed to be over 16,000 feet high. In 1903, Collie and Hugh Stutfield published an authoritative book on the region, Climbs and Explorations in the Canadian Rockies. Death Collie's grave on the Isle of Skye Collie retired in 1929 and thereafter spent his summers in Skye. He died at Sligachan in November 1942 from pneumonia, after falling into Loch Leathan below the Storr a year earlier whilst fishing. In keeping with his wishes, he was interred next to his friend, John MacKenzie, in an old graveyard at Struan by Bracadale next to Loch Harport.Ken Crocket, Mountaineering in Scotland : The Early Years,(Edinburgh: Scottish Mountaineering Trust, 2015) 53 Influence In a book published in 2013 it is suggested that Collie may have inspired Conan Doyle with some characteristics for Sherlock Holmes. Apart from his mountaineering skills Collie was a confirmed bachelor sharing his house with a solicitor. With an analytical mind honed by chemical research he had wide interests ranging from Chinese porcelain to fishing and from claret to horse racing. In addition he was an incessant pipe smoker only lighting a cigarette when refilling his pipe.

The distributor is credited with introducing numerous films, now considered masterpieces of world cinema, to American audiences, including the films of Michelangelo Antonioni, Sergei Eisenstein, Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, Akira Kurosawa, Satyajit Ray, Fran√ßois Truffaut, Yasujir≈ç Ozu and many other well-regarded directors. Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal (1957) was the film responsible for the company's initial growth. Janus has a close business relationship with The Criterion Collection regarding the release of its films on DVD and Blu-ray and is still an active theatrical distributor. The company's name and logo come from Janus, the two-faced Roman god of transitions, passages, beginnings, and endings. History Janus Films was founded in 1956 by Bryant Haliday and Cyrus Harvey, Jr., in the historic Brattle Theater, a Harvard Square landmark in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Prior to the conception of Janus, Haliday and Harvey began screening both foreign and American films at the Brattle Theater and proceeded to regularly fill the 300-seat venue. Having purchased the theater, Haliday, together with Harvey, converted the Brattle into a popular movie house for the showing of art films. Perceiving potential success in the film business, Haliday and Harvey moved into the New York City market and began running the 55th Street Playhouse. Janus Films was subsequently launched in March 1956 and the Playhouse was used as the primary location for exhibiting Janus-distributed films. The two owners eventually sold Janus Films in 1965 following a decline in the American art film market, and in 1966 Haliday also sold the Brattle, whilst Harvey continued to manage the theater into the 1970s. Janus was later acquired by Saul J. Turell and William J. Becker. Their sons, Jonathan B. Turell and Peter Becker, who also own The Criterion Collection, are still involved in the business, with Turell serving as company director in 2006. Recent releases On October 24, 2006, in celebration of 50 years of business, the Criterion Collection released 50 of the films that Janus distributed in a large boxset containing 50 DVDs and a 200-page essay on the history of art house films. The package was called Essential Art House: 50 Years of Janus Films. A.O. Scott chose the set as his DVD pick when he co-hosted At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper. As part of its 44th Festival in 2006, the New York Film Festival presented a series called 50 Years of Janus Films, a tribute to the company. In 2009, Janus Films released Revanche, its first first-run theatrical release in 30 years. Then, in 2010, Janus acquired domestic theatrical and home video rights to the Charlie Chaplin library under license from the Chaplin estate and worldwide distribution agent MK2.

Early life and family Born in 1896 in New Rochelle, New York, Robert was a son of Arthur Murray Sherwood, a rich stockbroker, and his wife, the former Rosina Emmet, a highly accomplished illustrator and portrait painter known as Rosina E. Sherwood. His paternal grandmother was Mary Elizabeth Wilson Sherwood, the author and social leader. He was a great-great- grandson of the former New York State Attorney General Thomas Addis Emmet and a great-grandnephew of the Irish nationalist Robert Emmet, who was executed for high treason after leading the Irish rebellion of 1803, one of a series of attempts to dislodge British rule in Ireland, in 1803. His relatives also included three other notable American portrait artists: his aunts, Lydia Field Emmet and Jane Emmet de Glehn, and his first cousin, once removed, Ellen Emmet Rand. Sherwood was educated at Fay School, Milton Academy and then Harvard University. He fought with the Royal Highlanders of Canada, CEF in Europe during World War I and was wounded. After his return to the United States, he began working as a movie critic for magazines, including Life and Vanity Fair. Sherwood's career as a critic in the 1920s is discussed in the 2009 documentary For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism. In this film Time critic Richard Schickel discusses, among other topics, how Sherwood was the first New York critic invited to Hollywood by cross-country train to meet the stars and directors. Writing career Sherwood was one of the original members of the Algonquin Round Table. He was close friends with Dorothy Parker and Robert Benchley, who were on the staff of Vanity Fair with Sherwood when the Round Table began meeting in 1919. Author Edna Ferber was also a good friend. Sherwood stood tall. Dorothy Parker, who was , once commented that when she, Sherwood, and Robert Benchley () walked down the street together, they resembled \\"a walking pipe organ.\\" When asked at a party how long he had known Sherwood, Benchley stood on a chair, raised his hand to the ceiling, and said \\"I knew Bob Sherwood back when he was only this tall.\\"Wallace, D. Capital of the World: A Portrait of New York City in the Roaring Twenties. Lyons Press (2011), p. 175. . In 1949, comedian Groucho Marx also commented about Sherwood's height during a filmed radio broadcast of the quiz show You Bet Your Life. Groucho, who hosted the popular series, interviewed in one episode American football player Howard Scala, a member of the NFL's Green Bay Packers. Impressed by Scala's own considerable height, Marx shared the following anecdote with the show's audience: Sherwood's first Broadway play, The Road to Rome (1927), a comedy concerning Hannibal's botched invasion of Rome, introduced one of his favorite themes: the futility of war. Many of his later dramatic works employed variations of this theme, including Idiot's Delight (1936), which won Sherwood the first of four Pulitzer Prizes. According to legend, he once admitted to the gossip columnist Lucius Beebe: ‚ÄúThe trouble with me is that I start with a big message and end up with nothing but good entertainment.‚Äù Sherwood was actively engaged with the advocacy for writers' rights within the theatre world. From 1937 to 1939, Sherwood served as the seventh president of the Dramatists Guild of America. Sherwood's Broadway success soon attracted the attention of Hollywood; he began writing for movies in 1926. While some of his work went uncredited, his films included many adaptations of his plays. He also collaborated with Alfred Hitchcock and Joan Harrison in writing the screenplay for Rebecca (1940). With Europe in the midst of World War II, Sherwood set aside his anti-war stance to support the fight against the Third Reich. There Shall Be No Night, his 1940 play about the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland, was produced by the Playwright's Company that he co-founded, and it starred Alfred Lunt, Lynn Fontanne, and Montgomery Clift. Katharine Cornell produced and starred in a 1957 TV adaptation on TV. Sherwood publicly ridiculed isolationist Charles Lindbergh as a \\"Nazi with a Nazi's Olympian contempt for all democratic processes\\". During this period Sherwood also served as a speechwriter for President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He recounted the experience in his book Roosevelt and Hopkins: An Intimate History, which won the 1949 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography and a 1949 Bancroft Prize.Alonso, HH. Robert E. Sherwood: The Playwright in Peace and War. Univ. of Mass. Press (2007), pp. 88-91. Sherwood is credited with originating the phrase that eventually evolved to \\"arsenal of democracy\\", a frequent catchphrase in Roosevelt's wartime speeches. Sherwood was quoted on May 12, 1940 by The New York Times\\" \\"This country is already, in effect, an arsenal for the democratic Allies.\\"Gould, Jack (May 12, 1940). The Broadway Stage Has Its First War Play. The New York Times. Quoting Robert Emmet Sherwood, \\"this country is already, in effect, an arsenal for the democratic Allies.\\" After serving as director of the Office of War Information from 1943 until the conclusion of the war, he returned to dramatic writing with the movie The Best Years of Our Lives, directed by William Wyler. The 1946 film, which explores changes in the lives of three soldiers after they return home from war, earned Sherwood an Academy Award for Best Screenplay.Alonso (2007), p.143.

Leslie gave the first modern account of capillary action in 1802 and froze water using an air-pump in 1810, the first artificial production of ice. In 1804, he experimented with radiant heat using a cubical vessel filled with boiling water. One side of the cube is composed of highly polished metal, two of dull metal (copper) and one side painted black. He showed that radiation was greatest from the black side and negligible from the polished side. The apparatus is known as a Leslie cube. Early life Leslie was born the son of Robert Leslie, a joiner and cabinetmaker, and his wife Anne Carstairs, in Largo in Fife. He received his early education there and at Leven. In his thirteenth year, encouraged by friends who had even then remarked his aptitude for mathematical and physical science, he entered the University of St Andrews. On the completion of his course in 1784, he nominally studied divinity at Edinburgh University but gained no further degrees. From 1788‚Äì1789 he spent rather more than a year as private tutor in a Virginian family, and from 1791 till the close of 1792 he held a similar appointment at Etruria, Staffordshire, with the family of Josiah Wedgwood, employing his spare time in experimental research and in preparing a translation of Buffon's Natural History of Birds, which was published in nine volumes in 1793, which brought him money. Middle years Frontispiece of Leslie's A Short Account of Experiments and Instruments, Depending on the Relations of Air to Heat and Moisture 1813 Leslie's home at 62 Queen Street, Edinburgh For the next twelve years (passed chiefly in London or at Largo, with an occasional visit to the continent of Europe) he continued his physical studies, which resulted in numerous papers contributed by him to Nicholson's Philosophical Journal, and in the publication (1804) of the Experimental Inquiry into the Nature and Properties of Heat, a work which gained him the Rumford Medal of the Royal Society of London. In 1805 he was elected to succeed John Playfair in the chair of mathematics at Edinburgh. This despite violent opposition on the part of a party who accused him of heresy. During his tenure of this chair he published two volumes of A Course of Mathematics- the first, entitled Elements of Geometry, Geometrical Analysis and Plane Trigonometry, in 1809, and the second, Geometry of Curve Lines, in 1813; the third volume, on Descriptive Geometry and the Theory of Solids was never completed. With reference to his invention (in 1810) of a process of artificial ice-making, he published in 1813 A Short Account of Experiments and Instruments depending on the relations of Air to Heat and Moisture; and in 1818 a paper by him, On certain impressions of cold transmitted from the higher atmosphere, with an instrument (the aethrioscope) adapted to measure them, appeared in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. In 1807 he became a member of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. 9, p. 518. His proposers were John Playfair, Thomas Charles Hope and George Dunbar. Later years When John Playfair died in 1819, Leslie was promoted to the more congenial chair of natural philosophy, which he held until his death. He published a famous book about multiplication table The Philosophy of Arithmetic in 1820. In 1823 he published, chiefly for the use of his class, the first volume of his never-completed Elements of Natural Philosophy. Leslie's main contributions to physics were made by the help of the differential thermometer,Photographs of differential thermometers. an instrument whose invention was contested with him by Count Rumford. By adapting to this instrument various ingenious devices, Leslie was able to employ it in a great variety of investigations, connected especially with photometry, hygroscopy and the temperature of space. In 1820 he was elected a corresponding member of the Institute of France, the only distinction of the kind which he valued, and early in 1832 he was knighted. In his final years he is listed as living at 62 Queen Street, a large Georgian flat in Edinburgh's New Town. Leslie died of typhusLondon Medical and Surgical Journal, January 1833 in November 1832 (during the epidemic of that year) at Coates, a small property he had acquired near Largo in Fife, at the age of 66. Leslie was an atheist.\\"In these years Leslie was an unsuccessful candidate for the chairs of natural philosophy at the universities of St Andrews and Glasgow respectively. He failed at the former because he was then an extreme whig and an atheist who deplored the Erastianism of many of the Scottish clergy.\\" Jack Morrell, 'Leslie, Sir John (1766‚Äì1832)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 (accessed May 2, 2008). Family John Leslie did not marry and had no children. His nephew was the civil engineer, James Leslie, son of his brother, Alexander Leslie, an architect-builder in Largo. His great nephew (James's son) was Alexander Leslie.

He became one of the first recognized Philippine artists. His winning the gold medal in the 1884 Madrid Exposition of Fine Arts, along with the silver win of fellow Filipino painter F√©lix Resurrecci√≥n Hidalgo, prompted a celebration which was a major highlight in the memoirs of members of the Propaganda Movement, with the fellow Ilustrados toasting to the two painters' good health and to the brotherhood between Spain and the Philippines. Regarded for work done in the manner of European academies of his time, Luna painted literary and historical scenes, some with an underscore of political commentary. His allegorical works were inspired with classical balance, and often showed figures in theatrical poses. Biography = Early life = Born in the town of Badoc, Ilocos Norte in the northern Philippines, Juan N. Luna was the third among the seven children of Joaqu√≠n Luna de San Pedro y Posadas and Laureana Novicio y Ancheta. In 1861, the Luna family moved to Manila and he went to Ateneo Municipal de Manila where he obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree. He excelled in painting and drawing, and was influenced by his brother, Manuel N. Luna, who, according to Filipino patriot Jos√© Rizal, was a better painter than Juan himself. Luna enrolled at Escuela Nautica de Manila (now Philippine Merchant Marine Academy) and became a sailor. He took drawing lessons under the illustrious painting teacher Lorenzo Guerrero of Ermita, Manila. He also enrolled in the Academy of Fine Arts (Academia de Dibujo y Pintura) in Manila where he was influenced and taught how to draw by the Spanish artist Agustin Saez. However, Luna's vigorous brush strokes displeased his teacher and Luna was discharged from the academy. However, Guerrero was impressed by his skill and urged Luna to travel to Madrid to further pursue his work. =Travel abroad= In 1877 Manuel and Juan Luna traveled to Europe, where Manuel studied music and Juan painting. Juan entered the Escuela de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, where he befriended the painter Don Alejo Vera. Luna was discontented with the style of teaching in school and decided that it would be much better to work with Vera. Vera brought him to Rome for some of his commissions, and Luna was exposed to the art of the Renaissance painters. It was in 1878 when his artistic talents was established with the opening of the first art exposition in Madrid which was called the Exposici√≥n Nacional de Bellas Artes (National Demonstration of Fine Arts). From then on, Luna became engrossed in painting and produced a collection of paintings that he exhibited in the 1881 Exposition. In 1881, his La Muerte de Cleopatra (The Death of Cleopatra)\\"The Death of Cleopatra\\" by Juan Luna , kulay-diwa.comOcampo, Ambeth R.

Luna's growing reputation as an artist led to a pensionado (pension) scholarship at 600 pesos annually through the Ayuntamiento of Manila. The condition was that he was obliged to develop a painting which captured the essence of Philippine history which would then become the Ayuntamiento's property. =Artistic career= Juan Luna in his Paris studio. In 1883 Luna started the painting demanded of him by the Ayuntamiento. In May 1884, he shipped the large canvas of the Spoliarium to Madrid for the year's Exposici√≥n Nacional de Bellas Artes. He was the first recipient of the three gold medals awarded in the exhibition and Luna gained recognition among the connoisseurs and art critics present. On June 25, 1884, Filipino and Spanish nobles organized an event celebrating Luna's win in the exhibition. That evening, Rizal prepared a speech for his friend, addressing the two significant things of his art work, which included the glorification of genius and the grandeur of his artistic skills.Spoliarium of Juan Luna displayed at Philippine National Museum of Fine Arts Luna developed a friendly relationship with the King of Spain and was later commissioned by the Spanish Senate to paint a large canvas which was called the La Batalla de Lepanto (The Battle of Lepanto).Anderson, Benedict Richard O'Gorman. \\"The Battle of Lepanto\\" by Juan Luna, including Footnote No. 15, Under Three Flags: Anarchism and the Anti-colonial Imagination, page 18. He moved to Paris in 1885 where he opened his own studio and befriended Hidalgo. A year after, he finished the piece El pacto de sangre (The Blood Compact) in accordance with the agreement he had with the Ayuntamiento of Manila. Depicted in this piece was the blood compact ceremony between the Datu Sikatuna, one of the lords in Bohol island, and the Spanish conquistador Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi.Ocampo, Ambeth. \\"The Blood Compact\\" by Juan Luna, from Juan Luna's Works, Looking Back, Inquirer Opinion/Columns, Inquirer, opinion.inquirer.net, October 24, 2007 It is now displayed in the Malaca√±an Palace. He also sent two other paintings in addition to the one required; the second canvas sent to Manila was a portrait of L√≥pez de Legazpi reconstructed by Luna from his recollection of a similar portrait he saw in the hall of the Cabildo, and the third was of Governor- general Ram√≥n Blanco y Erenas. In 1887, Luna once again traveled back to Spain to enter in that year's Exposition two of his pieces, the La Batalla de Lepanto and Rendici√≥n de Granada (Surrender of Granada), which both won in the exhibition. He celebrated his triumph with his friends in Madrid with Graciano L√≥pez-Jaena delivered Luna a congratulatory speech. Luna's paintings are generally described as being vigorous and dramatic. With its elements of Romanticism, his style shows the influence of Delacroix, Rembrandt, and Daumier. A Juan Luna masterpiece called ‚Äú¬øA Do...Va la Nave?‚Äù sold for P46.8M at a Makati auction. =Marriage= On December 4, 1886, Luna married Mar√≠a de la Paz Pardo de Tavera, a sister of his friend Felix and Trinidad Pardo de Tavera. The couple traveled to Venice and Rome and settled in Paris. They had one son, whom they named Andr√©s, and a daughter, Maria de la Paz, nicknamed Bibi, who died when she was three years old. Luna was fond of his wife. However, the jealous Luna frequently accused Paz of having an affair with a certain Monsieur Dussaq. Finally in a fit of jealousy, he shot the door wherein his wife was behind. Killing his wife and mother-in-law and wounded his brother-in-law, Felix in the process, on September 22, 1892. He was arrested and murder charges were filed against him. Luna was acquitted of charges on February 8, 1893, on the grounds of a crime of passion. Temporary insanity; the \\"unwritten law\\" at the time forgave men for killing unfaithful wives. He was ordered to pay the Pardo de Taveras a sum of one thousand six hundred fifty one francs and eighty three cents, and an additional twenty five francs for postage, in addition to the one franc of claims for damages (\\"dommages-int√©r√™ts\\"). Five days later, Luna went to Madrid with his brother, Antonio Luna, and his son, Andr√©s. =Murcia= A few years later, in October 1889, the artist travelled to southeast Spain, Murcia, as contained in the news release at the time, was provisionally installed in Moratalla where he made a portrait of the daughter of Juan Tamayo, an eminent man in this town. Passing through Murcia gave two portraits of the Queen Regent had made to the Provincial and City Council, respectively, and one of these was acquired by the provincial body for five hundred seventy-five pesetas installed on top of the Hall of Sessions of the Provincial Palace and then going to the presidential office in April 1932, one year after the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic, enters as a deposit Museum of Murcia along with several official portraits of royal iconography, being included in the different inventories and catalogs without sufficient data or references, just a terse \\"DJ.LUNA\\" as artistic attribution. =Final years= In 1894 Luna moved back to the Philippines and traveled to Japan in 1896, returning during the Philippine Revolution of the Cry of Balintawak. On September 16, 1896, he and his brother Antonio Luna were arrested by Spanish authorities for being involved with the Katipunan rebel army.Carmen Guerrero Nakpil, A plot to kill a general (October 27, 2008), The Philippine Star. Despite his imprisonment, Luna was still able to produce a work of art which he gave to a visiting priest. He was pardoned by the Spanish courts on May 27, 1897 and was released from prison and he traveled back to Spain in July.Foreman, J., 1906, The Philippine Islands, A Political, Geographical, Ethnographical, Social and Commercial History of the Philippine Archipelago, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons He returned to Manila in November 1898. In 1898, he was appointed by the executive board of the Philippine revolutionary government as a member of the Paris delegation which was working for the diplomatic recognition of the Rep√∫blica Filipina (Philippine Republic). In 1899, upon the signing of the Treaty of Paris (1898), Luna was named a member of the delegation to Washington, D.C. to press for the recognition of the Philippine government. He traveled back to the Philippines in December 1899 upon hearing of the murder of his brother Antonio by the Kawit Battalion in Cabanatuan. =Death= He traveled to Hong Kong and died there on December 7, 1899 from a heart attack. His remains were buried in Hong Kong and in 1920 were exhumed and kept in Andr√©s Luna's house, to be later transferred to a niche at the Crypt of San Agustin Church in the Philippines. Five years later, Juan would be reinstated as a world-renowned artist and Peuple et Rois, his last major work, was acclaimed as the best entry to the Saint Louis World's Fair in St. Louis, Missouri.‚ÄúPeuple et Rois‚Äù by Juan Luna , lopezmuseum.org.ph Some of his paintings were destroyed by fire in World War II.

Life and work Classically educated at the Wilhelmsgymnasium, Wecker got one of his first jobs as a songwriter at Munich's cabaret \\"M√ºnchner Lach- und Schie√ügesellschaft\\" in 1973. His breakthrough as a singer came in 1977 with the record Genug ist nicht genug (\\"Enough Is Not Enough\\"), which includes the popular talking blues \\"Willy,\\" about a presumably close friend of Wecker's who was slain by drunken Nazis. Wecker has released more than forty albums, and has also composed music for film, theater, and children's musicals. In 2003, Wecker became a public opponent of the Iraq War, joining his leftist Liedermacher colleagues Hannes Wader and Reinhard Mey. He is connected to the left-wing party Die Linke (The Left). In March 2006, Wecker was forced to cancel a scheduled performance in the small town of Halberstadt, Saxony-Anhalt. This came after the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD) pressured local authorities and threatened to forcibly disrupt the concert. Wecker pledged to return to Halberstadt in the summer of 2006, and eventually performed in Halberstadt on June 17, 2006, accompanied by fellow singer-songwriter Hannes Wader and Afghan percussionist Hakim Ludin.

If a company with limited liability is sued, then the claimants are suing the company, not its owners or investors. A shareholder in a limited company is not personally liable for any of the debts of the company, other than for the amount already invested in the company and for any unpaid amount on the shares in the company, if any. The same is true for the members of a limited liability partnership and the limited partners in a limited partnership. By contrast, sole proprietors and partners in general partnerships are each liable for all the debts of the business (unlimited liability). If shares are issued \\"part-paid\\", then the shareholders are liable, when a claim is made against the capital of the company, to pay to the company the balance of the face or par value of the shares. Although a shareholder's liability for the company's actions is limited, the shareholders may still be liable for their own acts. For example, the directors of small companies (who are frequently also shareholders) are often required to give personal guarantees of the company's debts to those lending to the company. They will then be liable for those debts in the event that the company cannot pay, although the other shareholders will not be so liable. This is known as co-signing. An issue in liability exposure is whether the assets of a parent entity and the sole owner need to be subject to the subsidiary‚Äôs liabilities, when the subsidiary is declared insolvent and owes debt to its creditors. As a general principle of corporate law, in the United States, a parent entity and the sole owner are not liable for the acts of its subsidiaries. However, as a caveat, they may be liable for its subsidiaries‚Äô obligations when the law supports piercing the corporate veil. Provided that the parent entity or the sole owner do not maintain separate legal identities from the subsidiary (through inadequate/ undocumented transfer of funds and assets), the judgment is likely to be in favor of the creditor. In the same regard, if a subsidiary is undercapitalized from its inception, that may be grounds for piercing the corporate veil. Further, if injustice/ fraud to the creditor is proven, the parent entity or the owner may be held liable to compensate the creditor. Thus, there is not one characteristic that defines the piercing of a corporate veil - a factors test is used to determine if piercing is appropriate or not. History By the 15th century, English law had awarded limited liability to monastic communities and trade guilds with commonly held property. In the 17th century, joint stock charters were awarded by the crown to monopolies such as the East India Company. The world's first modern limited liability law was enacted by the state of New York in 1811. In England it became more straightforward to incorporate a joint stock company following the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844, although investors in such companies carried unlimited liability until the Limited Liability Act 1855. There was a degree of public and legislative distaste for a limitation of liability, with fears that it would cause a drop in standards of probity.Shannon (1931)Amsler, et al. (1981) The 1855 Act allowed limited liability to companies of more than 25 members (shareholders). Insurance companies were excluded from the act, though it was standard practice for insurance contracts to exclude action against individual members. Limited liability for insurance companies was allowed by the Companies Act 1862. The minimum number of members necessary for registration as a limited company was reduced to seven by the Companies Act 1856. Limited companies in England and Wales now require only one member.Mayson, et al. (2005), p. 55 Similar statutory regimes were in place in France and in the majority of the U.S. states by 1860. By the final quarter of the nineteenth century, most European countries had adopted the principle of limited liability. The development of limited liability facilitated the move to large- scale industrial enterprise, by removing the threat that an individual's total wealth would be confiscated if invested in an unsuccessful company. Large sums of personal financial capital became available, and the transferability of shares permitted a degree of business continuity not possible in other forms of enterprise. In the UK there was initially a widespread belief that a corporation needed to demonstrate its creditworthiness by having its shares only partly paid, as where shares are partly paid, the investor would be liable for the remainder of the nominal value in the event that the company could not pay its debts. Shares with nominal values of up to ¬£1,000 were therefore subscribed to with only a small payment, leaving even a limited liability investor with a potentially crushing liability and restricting investment to the very wealthy. During the Overend Gurney crisis (1866‚Äì1867) and the Long Depression (1873‚Äì1896) many companies fell into insolvency and the unpaid portion of the shares fell due. Further, the extent to which small and medium investors were excluded from the market was admitted and, from the 1880s onwards, shares were more commonly fully paid. Although it was admitted that those who were mere investors ought not to be liable for debts arising from the management of a corporation, throughout the late nineteenth century there were still many arguments for unlimited liability for managers and directors on the model of the French soci√©t√© en commandite.Lobban (1996) Such liability for directors of English companies was abolished in 2006.DTI (2005) Further, it became increasingly common from the end of the nineteenth century for shareholders to be directors, protecting themselves from liability. In 1989, the European Union enacted its Twelfth Council Company Law Directive,89/667/EEC requiring that member states make available legal structures for individuals to trade with limited liability. This was implemented in England and Wales in the Companies (Single Member Private Limited Companies) Regulations 1992,Statutory Instrument SI 1992/1699 which allowed single-member limited-liability companies.Edwards (1998) Justification Limited liability has been justified as promoting investment and capital formation by reassuring risk averse investors. Some argue that limited liability is related to the concept of separate legal personality bestowed on the corporate form, which is promoted as encouraging entrepreneurship by various economists,Meiners, et al. (1979)Halpern, et al. (1980)Easterbrook & Fischel (1985) enabling large sums to be pooled towards an economically beneficial purpose. Criticisms An early critic of limited liability, Edward William Cox, a lifelong member of the Conservative Party, wrote in 1855: Others argue that while some limited liability is beneficial, the privilege ought not to extend to liability in tort for environmental disasters or personal injury.Grossman (1995)Hansmann & Kraakman (1991) Anarcho-capitalist Murray N. Rothbard, in his Power and Market (1970), criticized the need of limited liability laws, observing that similar arrangements emerge upon mutual and voluntary agreement in a free market: Maritime claims The 1957 Brussels Convention and the 1976 London Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims permit the charterer, manager, operators and salvors of a ship, and the master and members of the crew, to limit their liability for damage caused by events occurring ‚Äúon board or in direct connection with the operation of the ship, or with salvage operations\\" and for \\"consequential loss resulting therefrom‚Äù.Convention on limitation of liability for maritime claims, 1976 (with final act).

The course of the Madawaska River is accessible in Quebec by route 185 and New Brunswick by Highway 2, which run along the river side South West. Toponymy Various theories exist over the etymology of the word Madawaska. One is that the river's name comes from the Algonquian word \\"Madoueskak\\", which means \\"land of the porcupine\\". In Maliseet, the word \\"Matawaskiyak\\" translates to \\"at the place where water flows out over grass\\", there is also speculation that it refers to the 'meeting of two rivers where there is grass'. The Madawaska river is a large drainage basin for Lake Temiscouata and other waterways from the north. Before the city of Edmundston changed the natural course of the river, the spring freshet would cause several branches of the river to flood the land resulting in various waterfalls. The river formed part of the T√©miscouata Portage, a canoe and land route from the Bay of Fundy to the Saint Lawrence River dating from the late 17th century. A road, now Route 185 and part of the Trans-Canada Highway, was built along this route in 1862. The T√©miscouata Railway was built along the same route in 1886. In the early 20th century, timber and logs were floated down the river to New Brunswick. The Petit T√©mis Interprovincial Linear Park is a rail trail running from Edmundston, NB to Cabano, QC in the abandoned CN rail corridor that was originally built by the Temiscouata Railway. The toponym \\"Madawaska River\\" was officialized as of December 8, 1968, at Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec (Quebec Geographical Names Board).Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec (Quebec Geographical Names Board) - Banque des noms de lieux (Bank of Place Names) - Toponym: \\"Madawaska River\\"  Course of the river  The river has its source in Lake T√©miscouata. The Madawaska River originates in Lake T√©miscouata, about meters. The river follows a winding course generally oriented on South-East. The river runs through successively D√©gelis, Quebec, in Quebec; then the parish of Saint-Jacques Parish and Edmundston, in Madawaska County, in New Brunswick. The river empties into the left side of Saint John River in downtown Edmundston and facing the American town of Madawaska. The Madawaska River flows over generally towards the Southeast: Upper river courses (in Quebec) (segment of ) From the dam at the mouth of Lake T√©miscouata, the Madawaska River flows over: * to the South in a big S, passing at the East side of the \\"Mont Sainte-Anne\\", up to the bridge of the 7th Street in D√©gelis; * to the Southeast, bypassing the island Beaupr√© and passing southwest of a mountain, up to the confluence of the Birches River (Madawaska River) (from the North); * to the Southeast, forming a detour to the North, and then collecting the waters of Griffin Creek (from the Southwest), up to the confluence of the Languedoc creek (from North); * to the Southeast, passing on the Northeast of Edmundston airport, up to the border between Quebec and New Brunswick.

Dams  =Dam of Lake T√©miscouata= The river actually begins its course at the foot of the dam Lake Temiscouata. The dam, built in 1930 by the \\"St. John River Storage Company\\", was acquired by Hydro-Qu√©bec during nationalization of electricity in 1963. It was completely rebuilt between 1993 and 1994. The construction of this dam has had the effect of raising the lake level of about sixty centimeters above the normal high water level, set at , to reach the level of . The dam allows for storing of additional water from Lake T√©miscouata, less than 6% of the volume of water contained naturally in the lake. Another consequence of the enhancement of Lake T√©miscouata is the relative youth of the shores which limits the number of natural beaches and potential for recreation. =Edmundston Dam= =Fraser Dam= See also *Bas-Saint-Laurent, administrative region in Quebec *Temiscouata Regional County Municipality, a RCM of Quebec *Lake T√©miscouata, a waterbody in Quebec *Birches River (Madawaska River), a tributary *Perches River, a tributary *Trout River (Madawaska River), a tributary *Madawaska County, a county of New Brunswick *Edmundston, New Brunswick, a city of New Brunswick *Saint John River (Bay of Fundy), a river *List of rivers of New Brunswick *List of rivers of Quebec References  Bibliography  * * External links Category:Rivers of Bas-Saint-Laurent Category:Rivers of New Brunswick Category:Edmundston Category:Tributaries of the Saint John River (Bay of Fundy) ","title":"Madawaska River (Saint John River tributary)"},{"id":"1138189","text":"A This is a list of notable Algerian writers:  A  *Ferhat Abbas (1899‚Äì1985), political leader and essayist *Salim A√Øssa, pseudonym of Boukella, writer of detective fiction *Wasini al-A'raj (1954‚Äì ), novelist and short story writer *Atif Ali (1984‚Äì ) *Abdelkader Alloula (1939‚Äì1994) *Malek Alloula (1937‚Äì2015), poet and critic *Djamal Amrani (1935‚Äì2005), poet and essayist *Jean Amrouche (1907‚Äì1962), poet *Marguerite Taos Amrouche (1913‚Äì1976), writer and singer *Leila Aouchal (1937‚Äì ), novelist *Mohammed Arkoun (1928‚Äì2010) *Maya Arriz Tamza (1957‚Äì ), storyteller, novelist and playwright *Augustine of Hippo (354‚Äì430) *Zighen Aym (1957‚Äì )  B  *Fatima Bakha√Ø (1949‚Äì ) *Azouz Begag (1957‚Äì ), social scientist and novelist *Rabah Belamri (1946‚Äì1995), poet, short story writer and critic *Farida Belghoul (1958‚Äì ) *Omar Belhouchet (1954‚Äì ) *Myriam Ben (1928‚Äì2001), novelist, poet and activist *'Abdelhamid Ben Hadouga (1928‚Äì1996), novelist and short story writer *Latifa Ben Mansour (1950‚Äì ), writer and linguist *Mohammed Benchicou (1952‚Äì ) *Salah Benlabed (1950‚Äì ) *Malek Bennabi (1905‚Äì1973) *Jacqueline Benslimane, poet *R√©da Bensmaia, novelist and critic *Albert Bensoussan, novelist, translator and academic *Fatiha Berezak, poet and performer *Yve-Alain Bois (1952‚Äì ) *A√Øcha Bouabaci, poet and short story writer *Rachid Boudjedra (1941‚Äì ), writer and educator *Nina Bouraoui (1967‚Äì ), novelist *Hocine Bouzaher (1935‚Äì ), poet, politician and editor  C  *Albert Camus (1913‚Äì1960), author, philosopher and journalist *Martianus Capella (410‚Äì420 CE) *Mehdi Charef (1952‚Äì ) *Corinne Chevallier (1935‚Äì ) *H√©l√®ne Cixous (1937‚Äì ), feminist writer and critic  D  *, he wrote the first play in Arabic (in 1847). *Kamel Daoud (1970‚Äì ), journalist and writer *Djamila Deb√®che (1926‚Äì2010), novelist and essayist *Jacques Derrida (1930‚Äì2004), philosopher *Mohammed Dib (1920‚Äì2003), novelist and poet *Tahar Djaout (1954‚Äì1993), journalist, poet and fiction writer *Assia Djebar (1936‚Äì2015 ), Francophone writer, film-maker and academic  F  *Frantz Fanon (1925‚Äì1961), originally from Martinique, psychiatrist, philosopher and political theorist *Nabile Far√®s (1940‚Äì2016) *Fadhila El Farouk (1967‚Äì ) *Achour Fenni, poet and academic *Mouloud Feraoun (1913‚Äì1962) *Touati Fettouma (1950‚Äì ), Francophone novelist of the Maghreb *Catherine Filloux  G  *Fatima Gallaire (1944‚Äì ), playwright *Salima Ghezali (1958‚Äì ) *Fran√ßois Giuliani (1938‚Äì2009) *Anna Greki, pseudonym of Colette Anna Gr√©goire (1931‚Äì1966), poet *Fa√Øza Gu√®ne (1985‚Äì )  H  *Malek Haddad (1927‚Äì1978), novelist and poet *Mohamed Harbi (1933‚Äì )  K  *Yasmina Khadra (1955‚Äì ) *A√Øssa Khelladi  L  *Djanet LachmetAlec G.

This facility was then the third largest hog-packing plant in North America. The meat packing industry handles the slaughtering, processing, packaging, and distribution of meat from animals such as cattle, pigs, sheep and other livestock. Poultry is generally not included. This greater part of the entire meat industry is primarily focused on producing meat for human consumption, but it also yields a variety of by-products including hides, feathers, dried blood, and, through the process of rendering, fat such as tallow and protein meals such as meat & bone meal. In the United States and some other countries, the facility where the meat packing is done is called a slaughterhouse, packinghouse or a meat packing plant; in New Zealand, where most of the products are exported, it is called a freezing works. An abattoir is a place where animals are slaughtered for food. Pork packing in Cincinnati, 1873 The meat packing industry grew with the construction of the railroads and methods of refrigeration for meat preservation. Railroads made possible the transport of stock to central points for processing, and the transport of products.  History  = United States = Before the Civil War, the meat industry was localized, with nearby farmers providing beef and hogs for local butchers to serve the local market. Large Army contracts during the war attracted entrepreneurs with a vision for building much larger markets. The 1865‚Äì1873 era provided five factors that nationalized the industry: * The rapid growth of cities provided a lucrative new market for fresh meat. * The emergence of large-scale ranching, the role of the railroads, refrigeration, and entrepreneurial skills. * Cattle ranching on a large-scale moved to the Great Plains, from Texas northward. * Overland cattle drives moved large herds to the railheads in Kansas, where cattle cars brought live animals eastward. * Abilene, Kansas, became the chief railhead, shipping 35,000 cattle a year, mostly to Kansas City, Milwaukee and Chicago. In Milwaukee, Philip Armour, an ambitious entrepreneur from New York who made his fortune in Army contracts during the war, partnered with Jacob Plankinton to build a highly efficient stockyard that serviced the upper Midwest. Chicago built the famous Union Stockyards in 1865 on 345 swampy acres to the south of downtown. Armour opened the Chicago plant, as did Nelson Morris, another wartime contractor. Cincinnati and Buffalo, both with good water and rail service, also opened stockyards. Perhaps the most energetic entrepreneur was Gustavus Franklin Swift, the Yankee who operated out of Boston and moved to Chicago in 1875, specializing in long distance refrigerated meat shipments to eastern cities.Allan Nevins, The emergence of modern America, 1865-1878 (1927) pp 35-39. A practical refrigerated (ice cooled) rail car was introduced in 1881. This made it possible to ship cattle and hog carcasses, which weighed only 40% as much as live animals; the entire national market, served by the railroads, was opened up, as well as transatlantic markets using refrigerated ships. Swift developed an integrated network of cattle procurement, slaughtering, meat-packing and shipping meat to market. Up to that time cattle were driven great distances to railroad shipping points, causing the cattle to lose considerable weight. Swift developed a large business, which grew in size with the entry of several competitors.Alfred D. Chandler, Strategy and Structure: Chapters in the History of the Industrial Enterprise (1962). pp 25-28 The Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 was the first of a series of legislation that led to the establishment of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Another such act passed the same year was the Federal Meat Inspection Act. The new laws helped the large packers, and hurt small operations that lacked economy of scale or quality controls. Historian William Cronon concludes: :Because of the Chicago packers, ranchers in Wyoming and feedlot farmers in Iowa regularly found a reliable market for their animals, and on average received better prices for the animals they sold there. At the same time and for the same reason, Americans of all classes found a greater variety of more and better meats on their tables, purchased on average at lower prices than ever before. Seen in this light, the packers' \\"rigid system of economy\\" seemed a very good thing indeed. Labor issues In the early part of the 19th century, they used the most recent immigrants and migrants as strikebreakers in labor actions taken by other workers, also usually immigrants or early descendants. The publication of the Upton Sinclair novel The Jungle in the U.S. in 1906, shocked the public with the poor working conditions and unsanitary practices in meat packing plants in the United States, specifically Chicago. Meat packing plants, like many industries in the early 20th century, were known to overwork their employees, failed to maintain adequate safety measures, and actively fought unionization. Public pressure to U.S. Congress led to the passage of the Meat Inspection Act and Pure Food and Drug Act, both passed in 1906 on the same day to ensure better regulations of the meat packing industry. Before the Meat Inspection Act and the Pure Food and Drug Act, workers were exposed to dangerous chemicals, sharp machinery, and horrible injuries. In the 1920s and early 1930s, workers achieved unionization under the CIO's United Packinghouse Workers of America (UPWA). An interracial committee led the organizing in Chicago, where the majority of workers in the industry were black, and other major cities, such as Omaha, Nebraska, where they were an important minority in the industry. UPWA workers made important gains in wages, hours and benefits. In 1957 the stockyards and meat packing employed half the workers of Omaha. The union supported a progressive agenda, including the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. While the work was still difficult, for a few decades workers achieved blue-collar, middle-class lives from it. Though the meat packing industry has made many improvements since the early 1900s, extensive changes in the industry since the late 20th century have caused new labor issues to arise. Today, the rate of injury in the meat packing industry is three times that of private industry overall, and meat packing was noted by Human Rights Watch as being \\"the most dangerous factory job in America\\". The meatpacking industry continues to employ many immigrant laborers, including some who are undocumented workers. In the early 20th century the workers were immigrants from eastern and southern Europe, and black migrants from the South. Today many are Hispanic, from Mexico, Central and South America. Many are from Peru, leading to the formation of a large Peruvian community. The more isolated areas in which the plants are located put workers at greater risk due to their limited ability to organize and to seek redress for work-related injuries. Changing geography The industry after 1945 closed its stockyards in big cities like Chicago and moved operations to small towns close to cattle ranches, especially in Iowa, Nebraska and Colorado. Historically, besides Cincinnati, Chicago and Omaha, the other major meat packing cities had been South St. Paul, Minnesota; East St. Louis, Illinois; Dubuque, Iowa; Kansas City, Missouri; Austin, Minnesota; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; and Sioux City, Iowa. Rail to truck Mid- century restructuring by the industry of the stockyards, slaughterhouses and meat packing led to relocating facilities closer to cattle feedlots and swine production facilities, to more rural areas, as transportation shifted from rail to truck. It has been difficult for labor to organize in such locations. In addition, the number of jobs fell sharply due to technology and other changes. Wages fell during the latter part of the 20th century, and eventually, both Chicago (in 1971) and Omaha (in 1999) closed their stockyards. The work force increasingly relied on recent migrants from Mexico. Argentina Argentina had the natural resources and human talent to build a world-class meat-packing industry. However its success in reaching European markets was limited by the poor quality control in the production of their meat and the general inferiority of frozen meat to the chilled meat exported by the United States and Australia, By 1900, the Argentine government encouraged investment in the industry to improve quality. The British dominated the world shipping industry, and began fitting their ships for cold air containers, and built new refrigerated steamers. When the Argentine industry finally secured a large slice of the British market, Pateros and trade restrictions limited its penetration of the Continent.Robert Greenhill, \\"Shipping and the Refrigerated Meat Trade from the River Plate, 1900‚Äì1930.\\" International Journal of Maritime History 4.1 (1992): 65-82. China Meat in China moved from a minor specialty commodity to a major factor in the food supply in the late 20th century thanks to the rapid emergence of a middle- class with upscale tastes and plenty of money. It was a transition from a small ration of meat only for urban citizens to the world's largest meat- producer; it was a movement from a handful of processing facilities in major cities to thousands of modern meat packing and processing plants throughout the country. With the rapid growth of a middle-class with spending money.Guanghong Zhou, Wangang Zhang, and Xinglian Xu. \\"China's meat industry revolution: Challenges and opportunities for the future.\\" Meat science 92.3 (2012): 188-196.  Negative effects on meat packers  American slaughterhouse workers are three times more likely to suffer serious injury than the average American worker. NPR reports that pig and cattle slaughterhouse workers are nearly seven times more likely to suffer repetitive strain injuries than average. The Guardian reports that on average there are two amputations a week involving slaughterhouse workers in the United States. On average, one employee of Tyson Foods, the largest meat producer in America, is injured and amputates a finger or limb per month. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism reported that over a period of six years, in the UK 78 slaughter workers lost fingers, parts of fingers or limbs, more than 800 workers had serious injuries, and at least 4,500 had to take more than three days off after accidents. In a 2018 study in the Italian Journal of Food Safety, slaughterhouse workers are instructed to wear ear protectors to protect their hearing from the constant screams of animals being killed. A 2004 study in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine found that \\"excess risks were observed for mortality from all causes, all cancers, and lung cancer\\" in workers employed in the New Zealand meat processing industry. The act of slaughtering animals, or of raising or transporting animals for slaughter, may engender psychological stress or trauma in the people involved. A 2016 study in Organization indicates, \\"Regression analyses of data from 10,605 Danish workers across 44 occupations suggest that slaughterhouse workers consistently experience lower physical and psychological well-being along with increased incidences of negative coping behavior\\". In her thesis submitted to and approved by University of Colorado, Anna Dorovskikh states that slaughterhouse workers are \\"at risk of Perpetration-Induced Traumatic Stress, which is a form of posttraumatic stress disorder and results from situations where the concerning subject suffering from PTSD was a causal participant in creating the traumatic situation\\". A 2009 study by criminologist Amy Fitzgerald indicates, \\"slaughterhouse employment increases total arrest rates, arrests for violent crimes, arrests for rape, and arrests for other sex offenses in comparison with other industries\\". As authors from the PTSD Journal explain, \\"These employees are hired to kill animals, such as pigs and cows that are largely gentle creatures. Carrying out this action requires workers to disconnect from what they are doing and from the creature standing before them. This emotional dissonance can lead to consequences such as domestic violence, social withdrawal, anxiety, drug and alcohol abuse, and PTSD\\". Slaughterhouses in the United States commonly illegally employ and exploit underage workers and illegal immigrants. In 2010, Human Rights Watch described slaughterhouse line work in the United States as a human rights crime. In a report by Oxfam America, slaughterhouse workers were observed not being allowed breaks, were often required to wear diapers, and were paid below minimum wage.

General information Mestia is located in the Svaneti region of Samegrelo-Zemo Svaneti province (mkhare), some northeast of the regional capital of Zugdidi. Mestia and the adjoining 132 villages form Mestia District (raioni). Its area is ; and its population is 9,316 (1,973 in the town itself), according to the 2014 Georgia census. It was granted the status of a townlet (Georgian: daba) in 1968. Historically and ethnographically, Mestia has always been regarded a chief community of Zemo, or Upper Svaneti province. It was formerly known as Seti (·É°·Éî·Éó·Éò). The population is mostly Svans, a cultural and linguistic subgroup of the Georgians. Despite its small size, the townlet was an important centre of Georgian culture for centuries and contains a number of medieval monuments, such as churches and forts, included in a list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Mestia is served by the Queen Tamar Airport, which is operated by the state- owned company United Airports of Georgia, since 2010. Architecture and attractions The townlet is dominated by stone defensive towers of a type seen in Ushguli (\\"Svan towers\\"). A typical Svan fortified dwelling consisted of a tower, an adjacent house (machub) and some other household structures encircled by a defensive wall. Unique icons and manuscripts are kept in Mestia Historical-Ethnographic Museum. Mestia is also a centre of mountaineering tourism.

The CSC lobbies for the inclusion of creationism in the form of intelligent design (ID) in public-school science curricula as an explanation for the origins of life and the universe while trying to cast doubt on the theory of evolution. These positions have been rejected by the scientific community, which identifies intelligent design as pseudoscientific neo-creationism, whereas the theory of evolution is overwhelmingly accepted as a matter of scientific consensus. The Center for Science and Culture serves as the hub of the intelligent design movement. Nearly all of prominent proponents of intelligent design are either CSC advisors, officers, or fellows. Stephen C. Meyer, a former vice president of the Discovery Institute and founder of the CSC, serves as a Senior Fellow, and Phillip E. Johnson was the Program Advisor. Johnson is commonly presented as the movement's \\"father\\" and architect of the Center's Wedge strategy and \\"Teach the Controversy\\" campaign, as well as the Santorum Amendment. History In 1987, the US Supreme Court ruled in Edwards v. Aguillard against creation science being taught in United States public school science classes. In reaction, the term intelligent design was coined as a substitute in drafts of the textbook Of Pandas and People, which was published in 1989, beginning the campaigning of the intelligent design movement under the leadership of Pandas editor Charles Thaxton. The Edwards v. Aguillard ruling also inspired Phillip E. Johnson to begin anti-evolution campaigning. He met Stephen C. Meyer, and through him was introduced to others who were developing what became the Wedge strategy, including Michael Denton, Michael Behe and William A. Dembski, with Johnson becoming the de facto leader of the group. By 1995, Johnson was opposing the methodological naturalism of science in which \\"The Creator belongs to the realm of religion, not scientific investigation\\", and promoting \\"theistic realism\\" which \\"assumes that the universe and all its creatures were brought into existence for a purpose by God\\" and expects \\"this 'fact' of creation to have empirical, observable consequences.\\" In December 1993, Bruce Chapman, president and founder of the Discovery Institute, noticed an essay in The Wall Street Journal by Meyer about a dispute when biology lecturer Dean H. Kenyon taught intelligent design creationism in introductory classes. Kenyon had co-authored Of Pandas and People, and in 1993 Meyer had contributed to the teacher's notes for the second edition of Pandas. Meyer was an old friend of Discovery Institute co- founder George Gilder, and over dinner about a year later they formed the idea of a think tank opposed to materialism. In mid-1995, Chapman and Meyer met a representative of Howard Ahmanson, Jr. Meyer, who had previously tutored Ahmanson's son in science, recalls being asked \\"What could you do if you had some financial backing?\\" The Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture, as it was originally named, grew out of a conference called \\"The Death of Materialism and the Renewal of Culture\\" that the Discovery Institute organised in mid-1995. It was founded in 1996 by the Discovery Institute with funding provided by Fieldstead & Company, the Stewardship Foundation, Howard Ahmanson, Jr. and the Maclellan Foundation. The evolution of the Center's name in 2002 reflects its attempt to present itself as less religiously motivated in the public's eye.also PDF The evolving banners on the CRSC/CSC's website pictorially parallel these verbal efforts to disassociate the site from its overtly religious origins. The \\"renewal\\" in its name referred to its stated goal of \\"renewing\\" American culture by grounding society's major institutions, especially education, in religion as outlined in the Wedge Document.

Crowther, II, Director of Communications CSC's Wedge strategy An internal CSC report dating from 1998 which outlined a five-year plan for fostering broader acceptance of ID was leaked to the public in 1999. This plan became known as the Wedge strategy. The Wedge Document explained the CSC's key aims are \\"To defeat scientific materialism and its destructive moral, cultural and political legacies\\" and to \\"replace materialistic explanations with the theistic understanding that nature and human beings are created by God.\\" The document sets as \\"Five-Year Goals\\" \\"To see intelligent design theory as an accepted alternative in the sciences and scientific research being done from the perspective of design theory\\" and notably \\"To see major new debates in education, life issues, legal and personal responsibility pushed to the front of the national agenda.\\" This was seen in the following years, with public debates over the teaching of intelligent design in public school classrooms taking place in many states as part of the Teach the Controversy campaign. If the CSC's strategy is successful, within twenty years the goals are \\"To see intelligent design theory as the dominant perspective in science.\\" and \\"To see design theory permeate our religious, cultural, moral and political life.\\" The CSC has responded to controversy regarding the Wedge Document, saying \\"Conspiracy theorists in the media continue to recycle the urban legend of the 'Wedge' document...\\" CSC campaigns =Teach the Controversy= The CSC's Teach the Controversy campaign seeks to promote the teaching of \\"the full range of scientific views\\" on evolution on \\"unresolved issues\\" and the \\"scientific weaknesses of evolutionary theory.\\" Critics of the CSC's campaign say that they have manufactured the controversy and that they promote the false perception that evolution is \\"in crisis\\" and is a \\"dying theory.\\" Whether ID Is Science, p. 89. \\"ID's backers have sought to avoid the scientific scrutiny which we have now determined that it cannot withstand by advocating that the controversy, but not ID itself, should be taught in science class. This tactic is at best disingenuous, and at worst a canard.\\" The strategy has been to move from standards battles, to curriculum writing, to textbook adoption, all the while undermining the central positions of evolution in biology and methodological naturalism in science. The CSC is the primary organizer and promoter of the Teach the Controversy campaign. Examples of Teach the Controversy in action were the Kansas evolution hearings, the Santorum Amendment, 2002 Ohio Board of Education intelligent design controversy, and the Dover Area School District intelligent design controversy. The CSC believe that the program and curricula they advocate presents evidence both for and against evolution and then encourages students to evaluate the arguments themselves. Casting the conflicting points of view and agendas as an academic and scholarly controversy was proposed by Phillip E. Johnson of the Discovery Institute in his book The Wedge of Truth: Splitting the Foundations of Naturalism (2000). In his book, he writes of the 1999‚Äì2000 Kansas evolution hearings controversy over the teaching of intelligent design in public school classrooms: \\"What educators in Kansas and elsewhere should be doing is to 'teach the controversy.'\\" In its early years, the CSC (then called the CRSC) offered science curriculum that assured teachers that its \\"Web curriculum can be appropriated without textbook adoption wars.\\" This had the net effect of encouraging ID sympathetic teachers to side-step standard textbook adoption procedures. Anticipating a test case, Discovery Institute director Stephen C. Meyer along with David K. DeWolf and Mark Edward DeForrest published in the Utah Law Review a legal strategy for winning judicial sanction. According to published reports, the nonprofit Discovery Institute spends more than $1 million USD a year for research, polls, lobbying and media pieces that support intelligent design and their Teach the Controversy strategy. In August 2005, The New York Times reported that since 2004 there have been 78 campaigns in 31 states to either Teach the Controversy or include intelligent design in science curricula, twice the number seen in 2002‚Äì2003. =Intelligent design in higher education= The cultivation of support for ID and its social and political agenda in higher education is a very active part of CSC's strategy. The CSC has claimed that established scholars in the scientific community support intelligent design. CSC-recommended curricula benefits from special status at number of religious schools. Biola University and Oklahoma Baptist University are listed on the Access Research Network website as \\"ID Colleges.\\" In addition, the Intelligent Design and Evolution Awareness Center (IDEA), which began as a student organization at the University of California, San Diego, helps establish student IDEA clubs on university and high school campuses. The Intelligent Design and Undergraduate Research Center, ARN's student division, also recruits and supports followers at universities. Campus youth ministries play an active role in bringing ID to university campuses through lectures by ID leaders Phillip E. Johnson, William A. Dembski, Jonathan Wells, Michael Behe, and others. This activity takes place outside university science departments. Several public universities, including the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of New Mexico have had intelligent design often as freshman seminars, honors courses, and other courses outside required curricula in which instructors have wider latitude regarding course content. =Research fellowships= The CSC offers fellowships of up to $60,000 a year for \\"support of significant and original research in the natural sciences, the history and philosophy of science, cognitive science and related fields.\\" Published reports state that the CSC has awarded $3.6 million in fellowships of $5,000 to $60,000 per year to 50 researchers since its founding in 1996. Among the Center's publications are 50 books on intelligent design, such as those by William A. Dembski, and two documentary films, Unlocking the Mystery of Life (2003) and The Privileged Planet (2004), the later based on the book of the same name written by senior fellows Jay W. Richards and Guillermo Gonzalez. Since its founding in 1996, the CSC has spent 39 percent of its $9.3 million on research according to Meyer, underwriting books or papers, or often just paying universities to release professors from some teaching responsibilities so that they can ponder intelligent design. Over those nine years, $792,585 was spent to finance laboratory or field research in biology, paleontology, or biophysics, while $93,828 was spent to help graduate students in paleontology, linguistics, history, and philosophy. The results of this are found in Discovery Institute-authored science class curricula, \\"model lesson plans\\", which are at the center of many of the current debates about including intelligent design in public school science classes. CSC promotes these, urging states and school boards to include criticism of evolution science lessons, and to \\"Teach the Controversy\\", rather than actually teach intelligent design which is susceptible to legal challenges on First Amendment grounds. Evolution News & Science Today CSC publishes the blog Evolution News & Science Today (formerly Evolution News & Views), which is often shortened to Evolution News (EN). Controversies In May 2005, the Discovery Institute donated $16,000 to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, and by museum policy, this minimum donation allowed them to celebrate their donation inside the museum in a gathering. The Discovery Institute decided to screen The Privileged Planet. The video was also a production of Illustra Media, which has been identified as a front for a creationist production company. Upon further review, the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History determined that the content of the video was inconsistent with the scientific research of the institution. As a result, they refunded the $16,000, clearly denied any endorsement of the content of the video or of the Discovery Institute, and allowed the film to be shown in the museum as per the original agreement. Editorials have decried as na√Øve and negligent the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History's failure to identify the Discovery Institute as a creationist organization, exclude the video with its review process in the first place, and identify the entire incident as an example of Wedge strategy in action. The Center also funded research for the controversial book From Darwin to Hitler (2004) by Center fellow Richard Weikart. Weikart claims that Darwinism's impact on ethics and morality played a key role not only in the rise of eugenics, but also in euthanasia, infanticide, abortion, and racial extermination, all ultimately embraced by the Nazis. On September 6, 2006, on the Center's Evolution News & Views blog, Discovery Institute staffer Casey Luskin published a post titled \\"Putting Wikipedia On Notice About Their Biased Anti-ID Intelligent Design Entries\\". In the post, Luskin reprinted a letter from a reader complaining that English Wikipedia's coverage of ID to be \\"one sided\\" and that pro-intelligent design editors were censored and attacked. Along with the letter, Luskin published an English Wikipedia email address for general information and urged readers \\"to contact Wikipedia to express your feelings about the biased nature of the entries on intelligent design\\". Criticism Most criticism of the CSC and the Discovery Institute is that the Institute intentionally misrepresents many facts in the promoting of its agenda. A wide spectrum of critics level this charge: from educators, scientists, and the Smithsonian Institution to individuals who oppose the teaching of creationism alongside science on ideological grounds. The following are the most common areas in which the Institute is accused of intentionally misleading: *Teach the Controversy Mainstream scientific organizations maintain that there is no controversy to teach, in the sense that the theory of evolution is fully accepted by the scientific community. Such controversies that do exist concern the details of the mechanisms of evolution, not the validity of the overarching theory of evolution, and the controversy alleged by the Discovery Institute is manufactured. *Santorum Amendment Despite the amendment lacking the weight of law, consistent with the Discovery Institute's Wedge strategy, the amendment's inclusion in the conference report of the No Child Left Behind Act is constantly cited by the Discovery Institute as evidence that \\"federal education policy\\" calls for a \\"teach the controversy approach.\\" *Wedge strategy and the Discovery Institute agenda A common allegation often leveled at the CSC by critics is that it is conducting a campaign, the ultimate goal of which is to reshape American culture by influencing public policy to reflect conservative Christian values. The Wedge Document bolsters this claim. They claim that the Center's dismissal of the document and strategy is disingenuous, as when the Center's actions in the political sphere, such as its Teach the Controversy campaign, are taken into account it becomes apparent that the Wedge strategy is indeed being followed. *Peer review Though the CSC often claims that articles and books asserting intelligent design are published in the peer-reviewed scientific press, no pro-ID article has been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, Whether ID is Science, p. 87 with the exception of the one that had been quickly retracted by the publisher. That article, titled \\"The Origin of Biological Information and the Higher Taxonomic Categories\\", was by the institute's Stephen C. Meyer and was published in Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington in 2004. One month after its publication, the journal's publisher issued a statement repudiating the article as not meeting its scientific standards and as having sidestepped peer review (see Sternberg peer review controversy). Intellectual dishonesty, in the form of misleading impressions created by the use of rhetoric, intentional ambiguity, and misrepresented evidence; and a lack of rigor are the most common criticisms of the Center. Critics have also stated that its goal is to lead an unwary public to reach certain conclusions, and that many have been deceived as a result. Its critics, such as Eugenie Scott, Robert Pennock, and Barbara Forrest, claim that the CSC knowingly misquotes scientists and other experts, deceptively omits contextual text through ellipsis, and makes unsupported amplifications of relationships and credentials. Barbara Forrest, author of Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design and Glenn Branch say that the CSC uses academic credentials and affiliations opportunistically. In 2001 the Discovery Institute purchased advertisements in three national publications (The New York Review of Books, New Republic and Weekly Standard) to proclaim the adherence of approximately 100 scientists to the following statement: \\"We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.\\" Such statements usually refer to the institutional affiliations of signatories for purposes of identification. But this statement strategically listed either the institution that granted a signatory's PhD or the institutions with which the individual is presently affiliated. Thus the institutions listed for Raymond G. Bohlin, Fazale Rana, and Jonathan Wells, for example, were the University of Texas, Ohio University, and the University of California, Berkeley, where they earned their degrees, rather than their current affiliations: Probe Ministries for Bohlin, the Reasons to Believe ministry for Rana, and the CSC for Wells. During controversies over evolution education in Georgia, New Mexico, Ohio, and Texas, similar lists of local scientists were circulated. Alongside the allegation that the Center intentionally misrepresents facts, Eugenie Scott and other critics say there is a noticeable conflict between what the CSC tells the public through the media and what they say before conservative Christian audiences. They contend that this is a studied and deliberate attempt at the obfuscation advocated by Wedge strategy author Phillip E. Johnson.Johnson 2002. \\"So the question is: 'How to win?' That's when I began to develop what you now see full-fledged in the 'wedge' strategy: 'Stick with the most important thing'‚Äîthe mechanism and the building up of information. Get the Bible and the Book of Genesis out of the debate because you do not want to raise the so-called Bible-science dichotomy. Phrase the argument in such a way that you can get it heard in the secular academy and in a way that tends to unify the religious dissenters. That means concentrating on, 'Do you need a Creator to do the creating, or can nature do it on its own?' and refusing to get sidetracked onto other issues, which people are always trying to do.\\" Critics can also be found outside of the scientific community.

The Center's expenditures can be assumed to be substantial based on the scope and quality of the Center's extensive public relations campaigns, materials and contributions to local and regional ID and Teach the Controversy efforts. CSC director, Stephen C. Meyer, admits most of the Center's money comes from wealthy donors from the Christian right. Howard Ahmanson Jr., who provided $1.5 million in funding that established the Center, has said his goal is \\"the total integration of biblical law into our lives.\\" The Maclellan Foundation commits itself to \\"the infallibility of the Scripture.\\" Most Discovery Institute donors have also contributed significantly to the George W. Bush campaign. Until 1995, Ahmanson sat on the board of the Christian reconstructionist Chalcedon Foundation, and funds many causes important to the Christian right, including Christian reconstructionism.

He wrote over 30 novels, as well as numerous short stories, poems, and children's literature in the French language. He is probably Algeria's most prolific and well-known writer. His work covers the breadth of 20th century Algerian history, focusing on Algeria's fight for independence. Life Dib was born in Tlemcen in Algeria, near the border with Morocco, into a middle-class family which had descended into poverty. After losing his father at a young age, Dib started writing poetry at 15. At the age of 18, he started working as a teacher in nearby Oujda in Morocco. In his twenties and thirties he worked in various capacities as a weaver, teacher, accountant, interpreter (for the French and British military), and journalist (for newspapers including Alger R√©publicain and Libert√©, an organ of the Algerian Communist Party). In 1952, two years before the Algerian revolution, he married a French woman, joined the Algerian Communist Party and visited France. In the same year he published his first novel La Grande Maison (The Great House). Dib was a member of the Generation of '52 ‚Äî a group of Algerian writers which included Albert Camus and Mouloud Feraoun. In 1959, he was expelled from Algeria by the French authorities for his support for Algerian independence, and also because of the success of his novels (which depicted the reality of life in colonial Algeria for most Algerians). Instead of moving to Cairo as many Algerian nationalists had, he decided to live in France, where he was allowed to stay after various writers (including Camus) lobbied the French government. From 1967 he lived mainly in La Celle-Saint-Cloud near Paris. From 1976-1977 Dib was teacher at the University of California at Los Angeles. He also was a professor at the Sorbonne in Paris. In his later years he often travelled to Finland, which was a setting for some of his later novels. He died at La Celle-Saint-Cloud on 2 May 2003. In a tribute, the then French Culture Minister Jean-Jacques Aillagon said that Dib was \\"a spiritual bridge between Algeria and France, between the north and the Mediterranean.\\" Awards * 1953 F√©n√©on Prize * 1998 Mallarm√© prize Work In his work, Dib was concerned with bringing the authentic experience of Algerian life to a wider, particularly French-speaking, world. The Algerian revolution (1954‚Äì1962) profoundly shaped his thinking, and made him eager to bring to the world's attention Algeria's struggle for independence. An advocate of political equality, he believed that \\"the things that make us different always remain secondary.\\" He has received many awards from the French literary establishment. =Novels= His debut novel La grande maison was the first part of the Algerian trilogy about a large Algerian family. The main protagonist, Omar, is a young boy growing up in poverty in Algeria just before World War II. The trilogy is presented in a naturalistic style similar to that of √âmile Zola. The second part, L'Incendie, published in the same year the Algerian revolution started, was about Omar's life during the second World War. The final part of the trilogy, Le M√©tier √† tisser, deals with Omar's adult life as a working man in Algeria. It was published in 1957. The trilogy was partly autobiographical. His later works did not always use the same naturalistic framework of his earlier novels, often adding surrealistic elements. He used science fiction in Qui se souvient de la mer (1962), and verse in his last novel L.A. Trip. From 1985 to 1994 he wrote four semi-autobiographical novels about a North African man who visits a Nordic country, has a relationship and child with a woman in this country. The last novel in this series deals with the child visiting her fathers homeland. Dib also helped to translate into French various Finnish books.

The plot reflected the growing discontent among the ruling class of the Roman state with Nero's increasingly despotic leadership, and as a result is a significant event on the road toward his eventual suicide and the chaos of the Year of the Four Emperors which followed.  Plot  Gaius Calpurnius Piso, a leading Roman statesman, benefactor of literature, and orator, intended to have Nero assassinated, and replace him as Emperor through acclamation by the Praetorian Guard. He enlisted the aid of several prominent senators, equestrians, and soldiers with a loosely conceived plan in which Faenius Rufus‚Äîjoint prefect of the Praetorian Guard with Ofonius Tigellinus‚Äîwould conduct Piso to the Praetorian Camp, where the Guard would acclaim him as emperor. The conspirators were said to have varying motives. Some wished to replace Nero with a better emperor; others wished to be free of emperors altogether, and to restore a purely Republican form of government. According to the Roman historian Tacitus, the ringleaders included a Praetorian tribune named Subrius Flavus, and a centurion named Sulpicius Asper, who helped Piso devise the plot. The conspiracy was put in jeopardy by a woman named Epicharis, who divulged parts of the plan to Volusius Proculus, a fleet captain in Campania. Epicharis was involved with the conspiracy and was attempting to move it along faster. When Proculus complained to Epicharis that Nero did not favor him, she informed him of the conspiracy. Proculus informed Nero of the conspiracy and Epicharis was arrested. Though she denied the accusations, the conspiracy collapsed and Epicharis was tortured brutally. While on transport to be tortured a second time, she committed suicide by strangling herself with her own girdle. On the morning that the conspirators' plot was to be carried out (19 April) a freedman named Milichus and his wife discovered the conspiracy and reported it to Nero's secretary, Epaphroditos. The plot collapsed as Flavius Scaevinus, the man Milichus served, and Natalis, a conspirator whom Milichus also accused, quickly gave up everything they knew. Nero ordered Piso, the philosopher Seneca, Seneca's nephew Lucan, and the satirist Petronius to commit suicide. Many others were also killed. In Plutarch's version, one of the conspirators remarked to a condemned prisoner that all would change soon (because Nero would be dead). The prisoner reported the conversation to Nero, who had the conspirator tortured until he confessed the plot.Plutarch, Moralia 505C The ancient Roman historian, Tacitus, writes in Annals that \\"It was rumoured that Subrius Flavus and the centurions had decided in private conference, though not without Seneca's knowledge, that, once Nero had been struck down by the agency of Piso, Piso should be disposed of in his turn, and the empire made over to Seneca; who would thus appear to have been chosen for the supreme power by innocent men, as a consequence of his distinguished virtues.\\"  Named conspirators  :See also Members of the Pisonian conspiracy At least 41 individuals were accused of being part of the conspiracy.

Puerto Ayacucho is located across the Orinoco River from the Colombian village of Casuarito. The city was founded to facilitate the transport of goods past the Atures Rapids on the Orinoco River in the late 19th century (mostly rubber). Now the economy is supported by both national and international tourism. Also based here is the Venezuelan army and navy, conducting a continuous low level campaign against incursions and drug-runners from nearby Colombia. The climate is equatorial and the surrounding rainforests are some of the world's least explored and most untouched. The nearby forested mountains (tepuis) contain some of the world's least investigated microsystems. 200 km to the south is one of the natural world's great wonders, the Casiquiare canal, a waterway that links South America's two greatest river systems, the Amazon and the Orinoco. This was first reported in the 17th century and explored in 1800 by naturalist Alexander von Humboldt, who commented on the recent extinction of the Atur√®s Indians for whom the Atures Rapids had been named.Alexander von Humboldt, Personal narrative of travels to the equinoctical regions of the New Continent during the years 1799-1804, translated by Helen Williams (London: Longman, 1821), volume 5, p.620. The water in the Casiquiare flows from the Orinoco River into the Rio Negro, tributary of the Amazon, though much more is gathered en route from numerous tributaries. Nowadays tourists can organise a trip along it from Puerto Ayacucho. 90 km to the east is the second highest waterfall in Venezuela, the 2,200 ft (670 m) Yutaje Falls. Nearby is the Yutaje Tourist Lodge with its own airstrip in the jungle. Walks and river trips can be undertaken from here in the nearby selva. Of note is the large population of greenwing macaws, Ara chloroptera. There are also jaguars, pink river dolphins, numerous monkeys and other bird life. The inhabitants are mostly mestizo ‚Äì of mixed indigenous and Spanish descent. There are a number of local indigenous tribes including the Yanomami, the Panare, the Bari, Piaroa, and Guajibo (also known as Jibis). There is little traffic on the river these days. There is a range of medium and low cost hotels. While the city itself is not generally considered attractive, most visitors agree that the surrounding country is magnificent. Climate Puerto Ayacucho has a tropical monsoon climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Am) with a short dry season from December to March. Transportation Puerto Ayacucho is served by the small Cacique Aramare Airport, and has good bus connections to San Fernando, El Burro, San F√©lix and Ciudad Bol√≠var.

The terminology here is from complex multiplication theory, which was developed for elliptic curves in the nineteenth century. One of the major achievements in algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry of the twentieth century was to find the correct formulations of the corresponding theory for abelian varieties of dimension d > 1. The problem is at a deeper level of abstraction, because it is much harder to manipulate analytic functions of several complex variables. The formal definition is that : \\\\operatorname{End}_\\\\mathbb{Q}(A) the tensor product of End(A) with the rational number field Q, should contain a commutative subring of dimension 2d over Q. When d = 1 this can only be a quadratic field, and one recovers the cases where End(A) is an order in an imaginary quadratic field. For d > 1 there are comparable cases for CM-fields, the complex quadratic extensions of totally real fields. There are other cases that reflect that A may not be a simple abelian variety (it might be a cartesian product of elliptic curves, for example). Another name for abelian varieties of CM-type is abelian varieties with sufficiently many complex multiplications. It is known that if K is the complex numbers, then any such A has a field of definition which is in fact a number field. The possible types of endomorphism ring have been classified, as rings with involution (the Rosati involution), leading to a classification of CM-type abelian varieties. To construct such varieties in the same style as for elliptic curves, starting with a lattice Œõ in Cd, one must take into account the Riemann relations of abelian variety theory. The CM-type is a description of the action of a (maximal) commutative subring L of EndQ(A) on the holomorphic tangent space of A at the identity element. Spectral theory of a simple kind applies, to show that L acts via a basis of eigenvectors; in other words L has an action that is via diagonal matrices on the holomorphic vector fields on A. In the simple case, where L is itself a number field rather than a product of some number of fields, the CM-type is then a list of complex embeddings of L. There are 2d of those, occurring in complex conjugate pairs; the CM-type is a choice of one out of each pair. It is known that all such possible CM-types can be realised. Basic results of Goro Shimura and Yutaka Taniyama compute the Hasse‚ÄìWeil L-function of A, in terms of the CM-type and a Hecke L-function with Hecke character, having infinity-type derived from it. These generalise the results of Max Deuring for the elliptic curve case.

Clermont is a major hub for the large coal mines in the region as well as serving agricultural holdings. In the , Clermont had a population of 3,031 people, but its boundaries have subsequently changed. Geography Clermont is south-west of Mackay on the junction of the Gregory and Peak Downs highways. History Clermont State School, ~1905 Flood damaged, two-storey house, 1916 Leo Hotel moving along Lime Street after the flood, 1917 Gangalu (Gangulu, Kangulu, Kanolu, Kaangooloo, Khangulu) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Gangula country. The Gangula language region includes the towns of Clermont and Springsure extending south towards the Dawson River. Ludwig Leichhardt was the first European to pass through the Clermont area in 1845, but it was the discovery of gold in 1861 that was responsible for the establishment of the town, close to what was Babbinburra clan land. The town reserve was proclaimed on 25 March 1864, although a gold field was declared in the area in 1862. Clermont is named after Clermont-Ferrand in France; Clermont-Ferrand was the ancestral home of Oscar de Satge, one of the first European graziers who owned the Wolfang Downs pastoral run. Theresa Creek Post Office opened by 1863, was replaced by Coppermines Post Office at the end of 1863 and Clermont Post Office in 1864. Clermont State School opened on 27 August 1867. Copper was discovered soon after. In the 1880s up to 4000 Chinese people were resident in Clermont, mining for gold and copper. This led to racial riots and the Chinese were removed from the region in 1888. The decorated soldier Billy Sing was born in Clermont in 1886 of a Chinese father and English mother. The railway was extended north from Emerald to Clermont in February 1884. However, no passenger trains are available to or from Clermont. The town was originally established on low-lying ground next to a lagoon or billabong, but flooding was always a problem, with four substantial floods occurring between 1864 and 1896. St Joseph's School (opened on January 1900. The greatest flood, in 1916, killed 65 people out of a town population of 1,500 and remains one of Australia's worst natural disasters in terms of life lost. Following the 1916 flood, many of the wooden buildings of the town were moved using steam traction engines to a new townsite on higher ground. A local amateur photographer, Gordon Pullar took numerous photographs of the moving buildings, published in the 1980s as \\"A Shifting Town\\". In the mid-1920s, The Capricornian newspaper refers to a Mr P. Matones (Matonez) as being one of the first owners of the Paris caf√© in Clermont. John (Jack) and Marouli (Monty) Faros took over the Caf√© in the 1930s. It operated until 1992. The Clermont public library was opened in 1962. On 27 January 1959 a secondary department was added, Clermont State School providing secondary education (8-12). That arrangement ceased with the opening of Clermont State High School on 29 January 1990. Mistake Creek State School opened in the former locality of Mistake Creek in 24 January 1983. At the 2011 census, Clermont had a population of 2,177. On 17 May 2019, it was decided to discontinue the locality of Mistake Creek and absorb its land into the neighbouring localities of Clermont, Laglan, Frankfield and Peak Vale.

Clermont also hosted another larger coal mine; Blair Athol coal mine, located north west of Clermont. The mine supplied customers in Asia and Europe with up to 12 million tonnes of thermal coal per annum. The coal deposit was originally discovered on the site in 1864 and was first mined in 1890. Between 1920 and 1945 coal was mined with an underground method, which is still visible today. The most recent open cut operation started in 1984. Blair Athol Mine was closed on 26 November 2012 after it completely mined out. Its stockpile and train facilities will be used by the Clermont Mine.

It hosted National Hunt racing race meetings (over jumps) in the Winter months. It is situated on the Easton Neston estate. A greyhound racing track was opened in 2014 and staged the English Greyhound Derby until 2018. The course went into administration in August 2018 and the future of horse racing and greyhound racing at the venue became uncertain. In October 2019 it was announced that the course would not reopen following over 12 months in administration.  Horse Racing  The first meeting took place in 1928. The Towcester Racecourse Company was formed under the direction of Lord Hesketh, and it was on his then estate of Easton Neston, that the course was sited, and the first grandstand built. Towcester is highly popular among the racing fraternity, because of the sharp bends in the course, and the final gallop to the finishing post is uphill, which tests the horses and results in some unexpected finishes. In 2004 the Easton Neston estate, including the race course was put up for sale. Hesketh later decided to retain ownership of the course and sold only a portion of the estate to a Russian-born businessman. Entry was free from 2002 until 2006, during which time the course saw attendance grow significantly. In mid-2006, it was announced that from 26 December 2006 Towcester will be charging for entry to their two most popular annual meetings; Boxing Day and Easter Sunday. Selected other meetings are free. In 2008, Lord Hesketh decided to sell the course which is being offered as a going concern. On 7 November 2013, jockey Tony McCoy got his 4,000th career win at Towcester, riding Mountain Tunes to win the Weatherbys Novices' Hurdle.  Greyhound Racing  A new greyhound racing track has been built inside the racecourse, which opened in December 2014.  2018 administration  In August 2018 the future of Towcester racecourse was put in doubt. A statement released by the racecourse on 16 August read: \\"Towcester Racecourse Company Limited, proprietors of Towcester Racecourse, are currently experiencing trading difficulties and are in discussions with key stakeholders and professional advisers on the way forward. However, the directors have concluded that they have no alternative in the short term but to seek court protection and are now taking steps to place the company into administration. As a result, it is with regret that the greyhound meetings on this Friday, 17 August, and over the weekend at Towcester Racecourse have been cancelled. \\"Whilst inevitably there will be considerable interest from customers, supporters and suppliers, the directors ask that they be given time to focus on exploring other options for the business and they anticipate there will be a further update in the next few days. \\"The directors remain hopeful that despite the current situation, given the significant history of horseracing and more recently greyhound racing at Towcester, there will be significant interest from potential acquirers\\". On 23 August KPMG were appointed as administrators and 134 out of 137 members of staff at the racecourse were made redundant, many having to claim statutory redundancy from the government. On 13 November it was announced by the administrators that the racecourse's assets were being sold to a company called Fermor Land LLP. This company was formed on 18 October (26 days before the sale) and is headed by Lord Hesketh's brother-in-law Mark Westropp, a trustee of the Hesketh Family trusts.

Luis Sep√∫lveda was politically active first as a leader of the student movement and in the Salvador Allende administration in the department of cultural affairs where he was in charge of a series of cheap editions of classics for the general public. He also acted as a mediator between the government and Chilean companies. After the Chilean coup of 1973 which brought to power General Augusto Pinochet he was jailed for two-and-a- half years and then obtained a conditional release through the efforts of the German branch of Amnesty International and was kept under house arrest. He managed to escape and went underground for nearly a year. With the help of a friend who was head of the Alliance fran√ßaise in Valpara√≠so he set up a drama group that became the first cultural focus of resistance. He was rearrested and given a life sentence (later reduced to twenty-eight years) for treason and subversion. Luis Sep√∫lveda in 2009 The German section of Amnesty International intervened again and his prison sentence was commuted to eight years of exile, and in 1977 he left Chile to fly to Sweden where he was supposed to teach Spanish literature. At the first stopover in Buenos Aires he escaped and managed to enter Uruguay. Because the political situations in both Argentina and Uruguay were similar to those in his home country, Sep√∫lveda went to S√£o Paulo in Brazil and then to Paraguay. He had to leave again because of the local regime and finally settled in Quito in Ecuador guest of his friend Jorge Enrique Adoum. He directed the Alliance Fran√ßaise theatre, founded a theatrical company and took part in a UNESCO expedition to assess the impact of colonization on the Shuar Indians. During the expedition he shared the life of the Shuars for seven months and came to an understanding of Latin America as a multicultural and multilingual continent where the Marxism he was taught was not applicable to a rural population that was dependent on its surrounding natural environment. He worked in close contact with Indian organizations and drafted the first literacy teaching plan for the Imbabura peasants' federation, in the Andes. In 1979, he joined the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var International Brigade which was fighting in Nicaragua and after the victory of the revolution he started working as a journalist and one year later he left for Europe. He went to Hamburg in Germany because of his admiration of German literature (he learned the language in prison) especially the romantics such as Novalis and Friedrich H√∂lderlin and worked there as journalist traveling widely in Latin America and Africa. Sep√∫lveda in Italy, 2013 In 1982, he came in contact with Greenpeace and worked until 1987 as a crew member on one of their ships. He later acted as coordinator between various branches of the organization. His environmental activism then continued after he left Greenpeace. For example, he was a strong advocate for environmental protection in his beloved Patagonia, the subject of some of his most popular works.\\"Luis Sep√∫lveda y la Patagonia\\", Patagon Journal, April 17, 2020. In 1988 he won the Tigre Juan Award for his novel Un viejo que le√≠a novelas de amor, and in 2009 he won the Premio Primavera de Novela for his novel La sombra de lo que fuimos.\\"Entrevista con Luis Sep√∫lveda: Premio Primavera de Novela por 'La sombra de lo que fuimos'\\", El Pa√≠s, April 3, 2009. Retrieved August 6, 2016 He wrote novels, children's books, and travel guides. He was also a film writer and director. On March 1, 2020, after returning from a conference in Portugal, he was confirmed as the first man in the Asturias region of Spain to be infected by COVID-19.\\"El escritor chileno Luis Sep√∫lveda, primer afectado por coronavirus en Asturias\\", El Pa√≠s, March 1, 2020. By March 11, it was reported that Sep√∫lveda was in critical condition, that he was in an induced coma with assisted breathing due to multiple organ failure in an Oviedo hospital. He died on April 16 due to the virus.

Folk clubs were primarily an urban phenomenon of 1960s and 1970s Great Britain and Ireland, and vital to the second British folk revival, but continue today there and elsewhere. In America, as part of the American folk music revival, they played a key role not only in acoustic music, but in launching the careers of groups that later became rock and roll acts. British clubs =Origins= The \\"Princess Louise\\", Holborn Sandy Bell's, Edinburgh From the end of the Second World War there had been attempts by the English Folk Dance and Song Society in London and Birmingham to form clubs where traditional music could be performed. A few private clubs, like the Good Earth Club and the overtly political Topic Club in London, were formed by the mid-1950s and were providing a venue for folk song, but the folk club movement received its major boost from the short-lived British skiffle craze, from about 1955 to 1959, creating a demand for opportunities to play versions of American folk, blues and jazz music, often on assorted acoustic and improvised instruments.M. Brocken, The British Folk Revival, 1944‚Äì2002 (Ashgate, 2003), pp. 74‚Äì7. This included, as the name suggests, the 'Ballad and Blues' club in The Round House, Wardour Street, Soho, co-founded by Ewan MacColl, although the date and nature of the club in its early years is disputed.G. Boyes, The Imagined Village: Culture, Ideology, and the English Folk Revival (Manchester University Press, 1993), p. 231. As the craze subsided from the mid-1950s many of these clubs began to shift towards the performance of English traditional folk material, partly as a reaction to the growth of American dominated pop and rock n‚Äô roll music.M. Brocken, The British Folk Revival, 1944‚Äì2002 (Ashgate, 2003), pp. 77‚Äì8. The Ballad and Blues Club became the ‚ÄòSinger Club‚Äô and, in 1961 moved to the Princess Louise pub in Holborn, with the emphasis increasingly placed on English traditional music and singing the songs of one's own culture, e.g. English singers should avoid imitating Americans and vice versa, using authentic acoustic instruments and styles of accompaniment. This led to the creation of strict 'policy clubs', that pursued a pure and traditional form of music.G. Boyes, The Imagined Village: Culture, Ideology, and the English Folk Revival (Manchester University Press, 1993), p. 237. This became the model for a rapidly expanding movement and soon every major city in Britain had its own folk club. By the mid-1960s there were probably over 300 in Britain, providing an important circuit for acts that performed traditional songs and tunes acoustically, where some could sustain a living by playing to a small but committed audience.M. Brocken, The British Folk Revival 1944‚Äì2002 (Ashgate, Aldershot, 2003), p. 114. Scottish folk clubs were less dogmatic than their English counterparts and continued to encourage a mixture of Scottish, Irish, English and American material. Early on they hosted traditional performers, including Donald Higgins and the Stewarts of Blairgowrie, beside English performers and new Scottish revivalists such as Robin Hall (1936‚Äì98), Jimmie Macgregor (b. 1930) and The Corries.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), , pp. 256‚Äì7. Some of the most influential clubs in the UK included Les Cousins, Bunjies and The Troubadour, in London and the Bristol Troubadour in England's West Country. In Scotland there were notable clubs in Aberdeen. Edinburgh (Edinburgh Folk Club) and Glasgow. =Nature= Although the name suggests a fixed space, most clubs were simply a regular gathering, usually in the back or upstairs room of a public house on a weekly basis.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford University Press, 2005), , p. 37. These clubs were largely an urban phenomenon and most members seem to have been from the urbanised middle classes, although the material that was increasingly their focus was that of the rural (and to a lesser extent industrial) working classes.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford University Press, 2005), , p. 113. The clubs were known for the amateur nature of their performances, often including, or even focusing on local ‚Äòfloor singers‚Äô, of members who would step up to sing one or two songs.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford University Press, 2005), , p. 112. They also had ‚Äòresidents‚Äô, usually talented local performers who would perform regular short sets of songs.R. H. Finnegan, The Hidden Musicians: Music-Making in an English Town (Wesleyan University Press, 2007), pp. 57‚Äì61. In the late 1960s and early 1970s especially in the West country there was quite a revival of local folk clubs with regular weekly gatherings in places like Taunton, Halberton, Ottery St Mary, Exeter, Barnstaple, Truro, Padstow where a new group of local performers such as Cyril Tawney performed regularly along with local singers performing \\"Come all Ye\\" nights Many of these later emerged as major performers in their own right, including A.L. Lloyd, Martin Carthy, and Shirley Collins who were able to tour the clubs as a circuit and who also became major recording artists.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford University Press, 2005), , p. 45. A later generation of performers used the folk club circuit for highly successful mainstream careers, including Billy Connolly, Jasper Carrott, Ian Dury and Barbara Dickson.M. Brocken, The British Folk Revival, 1944‚Äì2002 (Ashgate, 2003), p. 132. =Later years= The number of clubs began to decline in the 1980s, in the face of changing musical and social trends. In London Les Cousins in Greek Street, where John Renbourn often played, and The Scots Hoose in Cambridge Circus, were both casualties.J. Harris, Christoph Grunenberg Summer of Love: Psychedelic Art, Social Crisis and Counterculture in the 1960s (Liverpool University Press, 2005), p. 139. The Singers Club (George IV, Lincoln's Inn) closed its doors in 1993. The decline began to stabilise in the mid-1990s with the resurgence of interest in folk music and there are now over 160 folk clubs in the United Kingdom, including many that can trace their origins back to the 1950s including The Bridge Folk Club in Newcastle (previously called the Folk Song and Ballad club) claims to the oldest club still in existence in its original venue (1953).Folk and Roots, Venues North East , retrieved 24 February 2009. In Edinburgh, Sandy Bell's club in Forest Hill has been running since the late 1960s.B. Shelby, Frommer's Edinburgh & Glasgow (Frommer's, 2005, p. 124. In London, the Troubadour at Earl's Court, where Bob Dylan, Paul Simon, Sandy Denny and Martin Carthy sang, became a poetry club in the 1990s, but is now a folk club again.P. Barry, ed., Poetry Wars: British Poetry of the 1970s and the Battle of Earls Court (Salt Publishing, 2006), p. 173. The nature of surviving folk clubs has also changed significantly, many larger clubs use PA systems, opening the door to use of electric instruments, although drums and full electric line-ups remain rare. The mix of music often includes American roots music, blues, British folk rock, and world music as well as traditional British folk music. From 2000 the BBC Radio 2 folk awards have included an award for the best folk club.'Previous winners', BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards, http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/event/folkawards2009/previouswinners.shtml, retrieved 24 February 2009. Since 2002 A \\"public entertainment licence\\"PEL was required from local authorities for almost any kind of public performance of music. To avoid the constant need to re-apply for licences for new events, some folk clubs opted to create a \\"Private members club\\" instead. This required that members of the public join at least 24 hours in advance, not on the night of the actual performance. Licensing laws changed over the following years. As a result of changes by the Live Music Act 2012, for example, live music in on-licensed premises is no longer a licensable activity between 08:00 and 23:00 hours before audiences of up to 200 people. Irish clubs A revival of Irish traditional music took place around the turn of the 20th century, which included feiseanna, c√©il√≠s and organised music competitions. Dancing and singing took place at well-known venues where local and itinerant musicians were welcome. An older style of singing called sean-n√≥s (\\"in the old style\\"), which is a form of traditional Irish singing was still found, mainly for very poetic songs in the Irish language. Under pressure from the clergy and the government of the time these were forced to curtail their activities. The Dublin City Rounders at Whelan's After a decline through the nineteen forties, an effort was made by a group of pipers to revive the folk tradition. The first national festival of Irish traditional music was held in Mullingar in 1951. In the same year Comhaltas Ceolt√≥ir√≠ √âireann was founded, dedicated to the promotion of the music, song, and dance of Ireland. Also, during the following years, came a growth of interest in the folk revival that was taking place in Britain and the US, and the success of The Clancy Brothers in the US. Folk clubs sprung up in Dublin and other Irish cities and towns in the early sixties, which were frequented by the likes of the Abbey Tavern Singers, The Dubliners, The Johnstons, The Pattersons, T√≠r na n√ìg and Sweeney's Men. The first folk club in Dublin was the Coffee Kitchen in Molesworth St., run by Pearse McCall, where Johnny Moynihan met Joe Dolan and Andy Irvine and formed Sweeney's Men.Johnny Moynihan, Folk Magazine, No.1 1967, p. 12 Johnny also played in the Neptune Folk Club on Cunningham Road, where he introduced the sea shanty to the Irish Folk Scene. The Auld Triangle was the favourite folk club of the Emmet Spiceland group. The Tradition Folk Club on Wednesdays in Slattery's of Capel Street hosted the Press Gang, Al O'Donnell, Frank Harte and others. The vocal group Garland had a loyal following on the Dublin folk circuit and continued singing as a group for about twenty five years. They mainly played in Dublin clubs such as The Coffee Kitchen, The Universal, The Swamp in Inchicore and The Neptune Folk Club. Garland eventually ran the Folk Club in the Blessington Inn (also known as the Blue Gardenia). They had such guests as Johnny Moynihan, Pumpkinhead and Tony McMahon. In the following decade groups such as The Barleycorn, the Dublin City Ramblers, Planxty and Clannad became popular on the folk scene.M. Scanlan, Culture and Customs of Ireland (Greenwood, 2006), pp. 169‚Äì170. There was a weekly radio programme on the Dublin Folk Scene presented by Shay Healy. However the number of folk clubs as such declined after 1980, and at the same time there was a growth of popularity in pub sessions. Also, Irish cultural centres have existed in the United Kingdom since the 1950s, primarily for the descendants of Irish immigrants. Mostly on Friday and Saturday nights these have been folk clubs in all but name. They have been able to book major Irish bands that ordinary folk clubs could not have afforded. American clubs See also: American folk music revival. New York's Greenwich Village was the most famous nexus for folk clubs in the Sixties. While some music took place quite informally in Washington Square Park, a number of clubs, such as The Bitter End and Gerde's Folk City were also central to the development of what was originally called \\"folk music\\" but would evolve into \\"Singer‚Äìsongwriter\\" music as more and more acoustic musicians performed original material. The Lovin' Spoonful is one example of a pop group that started in the folk world. In Boston, the most famous venue was the Club 47, where Joan Baez got her start. Later, this became Passim's. (During most of the Seventies, local station WCAS (AM) produced a live broadcast from this club called \\"Live at Passim's\\"; today the club is known as Club Passim). Other lesser known clubs, such as the Turk's Head and the Sword in the Stone (on Charles Street) and, later, the Idler (in Cambridge), also helped to make up what was known as \\"The Boston Folk Scene\\".http://www.meandthee.org/History.html History of the Me and Thee Coffeehouse \\"such institutions as the Sword in the Stone, the Unicorn, the Idler and Club 47 in Boston and Cambridge\\"http://www.garagehangover.com/?q=taxonomy/term/18/9 Garage Hangover interview with John Compton A number of lesser-known but still active musicians, such as Bill Staines and Chris Smither, also developed in this milieu. Philadelphia offered two such non-alcohol clubs: Manny Rubin's tiny Second Fret (The New Lost City Ramblers, Ian and Sylvia, Lightnin' Hopkins), and, in the Bryn Mawr suburbs, Jeanette Campbell's The Main Point, an intimate club featuring artists on their way up such as Joni Mitchell, Janis Ian, Phil Ochs and Bruce Springsteen. In California, one important San Francisco club was the hungry i; Los Angeles had The Troubadour and McCabe's Guitar Shop. The Freight and Salvage has been in operation since 1968. Caff√® Lena in Saratoga Springs, New York claims to be the oldest folk-oriented Coffee House, having opened in 1960. The Eighth Step Coffee House, originally in Albany, New York and now in Schenectady was founded in 1967. While the folk boom gave way to its rock descendants, forcing many clubs to close or to move to more electric music, in recent years, a number of venues have offered acoustic music (usually original) in a way that continues at least part of the function of the folk clubs. Traditional music, however, which was at the root of these developments, is more often offered by local folk societies, such as Calliope: Pittsburgh Folk Music Society, Athens Folk Music and Dance Society, etc. See also * Pub session Notes Further reading *Peters, Brian (Oct. 1994) \\"Club death: have folk clubs gone irrevocably into senility?

A virtual studio is a television studio that allows the real-time combination of people or other real objects and computer generated environments and objects in a seamless manner. A key point of a virtual studio is that the real camera can move in 3D space, while the image of the virtual camera is being rendered in real-time from the same perspective, therefore, this virtual scene has to adapt at any time to the camera settings (zoom, pan, angle, traveling, etc.). This is what differentiates a virtual studio from the traditional technique of chromakey. It also differs from techniques used in film, in which scenes are edited later. A virtual studio does not need any post production because it is in real-time. However a 3-D graphic artist and 3D computer graphics software are needed to create the virtual background, and any graphics that appear in front. There exist many technical solutions for creating virtual studios, but most of them include the following components: * Camera tracking, that uses either optical or mechanical measurements to create a live stream of data describing the exact perspective of the camera. * Realtime rendering software, that uses the camera tracking data and generates a synthetic image of a television studio. * A video mixer, which combines the video from the camera with the video from the realtime rendering software to produce a final video output. One of the most common ways to mix the video to replace a chroma key background. A major difference between a virtual studio and the bluescreen special effects used in movies is that the computer graphics are rendered in realtime, removing the need for any post production work, and allowing it to be used in live television broadcasts.

She is the daughter of the late general and President of Guatemala Efra√≠n R√≠os Montt. She served four terms in Congress, where she was Chair of the Foreign Relations Committee. She also served on the Steering Committee of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and was the Chair of the IPU's Latin American Group where she was elected unanimously by parliamentarians from the Latin American nations. Zury was the presidential candidate for the party VIVA at the 2015 elections. Family and education Zury R√≠os Sosa was born in January 1968, the third child of Jos√© Efra√≠n R√≠os Montt and Mar√≠a Teresa Sosa √Åvila. Rios Sosa's father, a former Guatemalan army general and illegitimate President of Guatemala, was found guilty of genocide against the Ixil Maya and crimes against humanity. Her brothers, Enrique and Homero, both followed their father's military footsteps and enlisted in the armed forces: Homero, a military doctor, was killed by guerrillas in 1984, while rescuing wounded army soldiers and attempting to put them aboard an army helicopter that was brought down by rebel weapons fire in El Pet√©n; Enrique was chief of the Army General Staff before resigning his commission in September 2003 when charged with having embezzled Q30 million (‚Ç¨3.25m/US$3.75m).http://www.prensalibre.com/pl/2004/diciembre/01/102712.html When she was 10 years old, her father renounced Catholicism and became an ordained minister in a Guatemalan offshoot of the Gospel Outreach Church. Zury R√≠os studied at schools in Guatemala and Spain, where her father was assigned as military attach√© following the 1974 presidential election, a process tainted by accusations of electoral fraud in which he had been a candidate. She graduated magna cum laude in political and social science from Francisco Marroqu√≠n University. Her first job (1988‚Äì1989) was as a lecturer in social and economic studies at the Escuela Cristiana Verbo in Guatemala City and she has also worked as a primary school teacher. She has been married four times. Prior to her current union, she was married to Jeovanny Ch√°vez, deputy Jos√© Garc√≠a Bravatti, and businessman Roberto L√≥pez Villatoro.http://www.prensalibre.com/pl/2004/julio/08/92524.html During her marriage to L√≥pez Villatoro, she was also known as R√≠os de L√≥pez. On 20 November 2004, at a ceremony held in General R√≠os Montt's compound near Antigua Guatemala, and with the general presiding at the ceremony, she married U.S. Congressman Jerry Weller (R-Illinois). Following the wedding, she stated that although she planned to live in the United States with her husband, she would continue serving in the Guatemalan legislature; a lawyer for Weller told the U.S. House Ethics Committee that she did not plan on becoming a U.S. citizen. In March 2006 the Wellers announced that she was pregnant,http://www.soapblox.net/liberilview/showDiary.do?diaryId=186 and a daughter, Mariz√∫ Catherine, was born on 17 August 2006 in a Guatemala City hospital. The child holds dual U.S. and Guatemalan nationality. Political career In 1989 Zury R√≠os joined the public relations department of the then newly created Guatemalan Republican Front in preparation for the 1990 presidential election. In that election, the FRG won 10 seats in Congress. However, her father was barred from running for president due to a provision in the constitution barring coup leaders from running. Following the election, Zury R√≠os worked as an administrative assistant to the FRG congressional bloc and as private secretary to the Speaker of Congress. In 1996 she was elected to Congress as a national list deputy. In 1998 she was elected to the FRG's executive committee and political council. In 1999 she was re-elected to Congress, again from her party's national list. During the 2000‚Äì04 legislative session, she served as one of the two deputy speakers and on the congressional foreign relations committee. She was elected to a third term in the 2003 general election, receiving the second highest number of votes on the national electoral lists. During the 2004‚Äì08 legislature, she served as vice chair of the foreign relations committee and on the health, sport, social welfare, and ethics committees. Much of her congressional work has focused on reproductive health issues, the HIV-AIDS situation, and combating tobacco use; some of her supporters see her as a potential future foreign minister or even president of the Republic. In 2003, prior to the election, Zury R√≠os was accused of being one of the organizers of jueves negro (\\"Black Thursday\\"). In mid-2003, the FRG was again trying to get General R√≠os Montt on to the presidential ticket, arguing that applying the constitutional ban preventing former coup leaders from seeking the presidency should not apply to him in accordance with the principle of nonretroactive application of the law: his 1982 coup d'√©tat preceded the enactment of the 1985 Constitution. After a series of court decisions ruling alternately that he could or could not run, culminating with a 21 July 2003 ruling by the Supreme Court suspending his candidacy, on Thursday, 24 July 2003 FRG officials and supporters led a mass demonstration in Guatemala City to protest his disqualification. The demonstration degenerated into a bloody riot that left one man dead (journalist H√©ctor Fernando Ram√≠rez); it was, however, perceived as having been successful in getting General R√≠os Montt's name on the presidential ballot when, a week later, the Constitutional Court overturned the Supreme Court's ban. Although General R√≠os Montt ultimately lost the November 2003 election, he enjoyed his daughter's full support. Zury R√≠os accompanied her father on his campaign trail, generally introducing him, in highly favorable terms, before he addressed his rallies.

We then go back in time, with the second chapter showing a tense dinner party, at which Gilles appears to admit to infidelity.

The final chapter takes place at an Italian beach resort, where their relationship began. The individual chapters are all punctuated by romantic Italian love songs, which Ozon has said he chose for their \\"over-the-top sentimentality\\" and in order to offset the darkness of some of the scenes in the film.

The latter two claimed heirs to the earlier Three Kingdoms of Korea, which had been united by Silla. This period arose out of national unrest during the reign of Queen Jinseong of Silla, and usually refers to the era between the founding of Hubaekje by Gyeon Hwon to the time Goryeo unified the peninsula.. In fact, this period corresponds to the end of the Silla Dynasty, and since Balhae was still in the north until 926, it is considered that Korea is still in the era of the North and South. At the end of the year, the rule of Silla weakened, and local peers emerged as a national uprising caused by excessive taxation in the midst of the horse-bearing power in each region. The representative figures are Gyeon Hwon, Gungye and Yanggil, who set up the revival of Baekje and Gongye the revival of Goguryeo. In the end, Silla was divided again and the so-called post-samguk era started. Later on, as the king of Goguryeo defeated Gungye, and Wang Geon emerged, the future three kingdoms' colonization of Korea was centered on Goryeo. Background In the 9th and 10th century, Silla was shaken by problems arising from its reliance on the \\"bone rank system\\", a rigid class system under which only those from an aristocratic background could be appointed to high office. The system was being abused as a means for the ruling royal family to dominate politically and this caused much unrest in the latter days of Silla. The local gentry called hojok (hangul:Ìò∏Ï°±, hanja: Ë±™Êóè), i.e. prominent local clan, strengthened their power during this chaotic period by assembling armies of their own and independently centralizing their forces.. Dissention deepened within the nobility after the death of King Hyegong as contention over the royal succession intensified and power struggles were constant among the hojok. Not only was the political atmosphere in a shambles, the financial state of Silla was dire. Taxation was difficult without the nobles' cooperation. As a result, the tax burden fell heavily on the peasants and farmers, who consequently revolted in 889, the third year of Queen Jinseong's reign. Numerous revolts and uprisings occurred during the following 100 years, breaking Silla down. As Silla era enters to the end, the division of the aristocratic society deepened and a series of political reforms aimed at strengthening its regime failed. In the midst of such a fierce struggle, the central nobility's struggle for the throne took place, resulting in 20 political changes from 768 (the 4th year of King Hyegong's reign) to 887 (the 1st year of King Jinseong's reign). Outside, conflicts between the ruling class and those of the military, such as those of those with complaints, have intensified, resulting in political chaos, which has gradually weakened control. Especially after the failure of King Heungdeok's political reforms, the central government's control over the provinces was further weakened by the fierce battle for the throne. In rural areas, the power of the nobility and provinces, separated from the central government, grew into a central power, with such a background as Buddhist temples, foreign trade, military forces, and local government. In addition, the social foundation of the goldongbong, which had been used to support the Silla society, was reduced, significantly weakening the status of the Jingol nobles. In addition, the great territory management of the Jingol nobles was expanded, and with the fall of the self-employed and the small farming class, famine led to the people wandering around and the people were agitated. As a result, the central government has failed to collect taxes from various local leaders, leading to the national finances being in need. Due to these factors, the Silla community was divided and no longer had the power to support the nation. Rebels began in various parts of the country as Silla's control over the peninsula collapsed and the decentralization phenomenon was widespread. Originally, local people have been inclined to look promising for a long time because of the heavy tax burden and the harsh enforcement of the tax. However, by the end of the century, they had to suffer from a burden from the year of the state as well as the contradictions of the receiving system, which became more acute due to the possession of large houses of nobles and decadent pleasures. The oppressed local people went from place to place or were protected by the nobles of the powerful, and their soldiers and slaves were disturbed. This condition finally exploded in 889 with the tax urging of Queen Jinseong, who laid the foundation for a nationwide civil war. This collapse in the ruling camp and the burden of taxation on the lower floors led Silla to the path of the self-moteness, which led to the formation of a third kingdom. Later Baekje = Foundation = As Silla started to crumble, Gyeon Hwon, a former general of Silla, led rebel troops to seize the provincial capital of Mujinju (hangul:Î¨¥ÏßÑÏ£º, hanja:Ê≠¶ÁèçÂ∑û) in 892. He then conquered the Honam region and in 900, Gyeon Hwon declared himself king of Later Baekje, a country to revive Baekje's glory. He established his capital at Wansanju (hangul:ÏôÑÏÇ∞Ï£º, hanja:ÂÆåÂ±±Â∑û), and continued to expand the kingdom.. It was founded by Gyeon Hwon in 892 and was established by King Taejo Wang Geon of Goryeo in 936, and was established by King Taejo of Goryeo for 2 to 45 years. Silla fell into confusion at the time of the reign of King Hadae due to the luxury of the nobles, corruption and the succession of the throne. Furthermore, the failure of Queen JinSeong and the continued famine have made life more difficult for the people. Nevertheless, as Silla's central government pressed for taxation, a nationwide rebellion broke out. In this atmosphere, Gyeon Hwon led the group to occupy Mujin-ju and declared to the people that he would solve the grudge of King Uija in 1989. After Gungye founded the kingdom, Goguryeo and Silla formed a third kingdom to compete for supremacy = National leader = Gyeon hwon, As he grew older, he had better body hair than any other soldiers, and went to Gyeongju to become a champion on the southwestern coast. At that time, the authority of the Silla king's chamber was reduced, and the region was occupied by the Hojo people, forming an anti-impercent force. In particular, when Queen Jinsin was crowned, political discipline was undermined by the tyranny of some of the gods who were favored by the king, and the famine caused the hopes of the people and the uprising of the early stage. The attack on the southwestern Juhyeon (interstate) of Gyeongju was met by many people. Finally, in 892 (the sixth year of King Jinsin's reign), he conquered Mujin-ju and ascended to the throne by himself. In 900 A.D., he went to Wansan-ju, where he established a capital and called it King Hubakje, and he appointed all government offices and government offices. The following year, they attacked the Daeyeon Fortress, but failed to capture it. In his anger over Wang Geon's invasion of Naju in 910 (the 14th year of King Hyeonseong's reign), he surrounded and attacked 3,000 men, but failed to win. After Wang Geon defeated Gungye and founded Goryeo, he dispatched Ilgil Chan to celebrate Wang Geon's accession to the throne. But in fact, Goryeo and Hubaekje were fighting for power at this time. It took the army to the site of Jinyeongseong in 922 (King Gyeongmyeong 4) with 10,000 people. In response, King Gyeongmyeong of Silla dispatched Kim Yool to Goryeo to ask for help. In 924 (Dear King 1), Gan Hwon sent his son Sumigang to attack the castle, but the soldiers of Seongjeong could not protect it. = Development and expansion = Gyeon Hwon rose against Silla. First, he established the reign of King Seokcheon and Dochan of Silla, and then gradually moved north to Junju. In particular, until former times, Gyeon Hwon had claimed to be merely a local official of Silla, but he established his own regime by officially naming the king of Baekje after the relocation of Jeonju. Although it is not clear whether the government or government offices were reorganized, it seems that the government has managed the Shilla administration as it was. This is in stark contrast to the fact that Taebong, which was founded by Gungye, had its own government and government Gyeon Hwon focused on expanding the local paper after the relocation of Jeonju in 900 A.D. Gan Hwon's local paper boat was largely divided into three regions, with different aspects. First of all, the southwestern coastal area of the southwestern coast, which is the basis of the early power of Gan Hwon and the sea route of China, was initially disconnected from the control of the Gyeon Hwon regime and was related to Wang Geon of the Gungye regime. Thus, until the establishment of Goryeo in 918, he focused mainly on the pursuit of Naju and the southwestern tidal wave. = Cultural heritage = Gumsansa which is All the records before the Japanese Invasion of Korea were destroyed and private documents were created, citing the Samguk Yusa and the Three Kingdoms Magi, and the construction of Geumsansa Temple was made in 599 (King of Baekje, King 1) So far, Jinpo (Áéã Ë°®) has been reconstructed over four years from the year 762 (the 21st year of King Gyeongdeok of Silla) to the year 766 (the second year of King Hyegong of Silla) Gumsansa is the place where gyeon hwon was prisoned by his son,Sin gum = Fall = Gyeon Hwon, who was expanding his territory with strong military strength, was suddenly kicked out by his son sin geum. An internal conflict broke out over the succession of the throne. As he worked with local peers to promote the marriage policy, Gyeon hwon had several wives. Soon after entering Mujinju, she married the daughter of a group of people from Mujin-ju, and later received the daughter of the Ho-jong in the state of Wansan, which was designated as the capital. Naturally, there were many princes. As a result, there was a dispute over the throne after Gyeon Hwon. Gyeon Hwon had favored his fourth son, Geumgang, and tried to make him his successor, but the three brothers on the Geumgang River were unhappy. In particular, Shin, the oldest son, was the most dissatisfied. The three brothers, Shin, Yang, Yong-gae and the fourth Geumgang, had different mothers. Finally, a new sword broke loose. Sinbeon dethroned his father Gaon Hwon and locked him in Geumsansa Temple. And they killed the Augang River. The second king of Hobaekje was named after the king. Gyeon Hwon was imprisoned in Geumsansa Temple for three months. Meanwhile, he sneaked out and surrendered to Goryeo. When Wang Geon, who had been an enemy until recently, asked for help, he happily accepted Gaon Hwon, called him Father, and treated him with great devotion. In Goryeo, more than 100,000 soldiers are organized to attack Baekbaeje. When Gyeon Hwon helped Wang Geon to attack the country he had set up, Hubakje's new sword was confronted by his father. The Hubaekje and the Goryeo army fought back, but the HubaijI were defeated by the powerful Goryeo army and retreated. The troops of Goryeo advanced to the level of sulfuric acid (Nonsan), and the new sword surrendered. Finally, the Hubaekje was destroyed (936), which ended the era of the Three Kingdoms. = Battle of Illicheon = In 936 (Taejo 19), there was a large-scale battle between Goryeo and Hubakje in Gumi, North Gyeongsang Province. Back then, the situation of Hobaekje was under the rule of shingum.while his father Gyeon hwon surrenderd to Taejo. In June 936, Gyeon Hwon asked Taejo to attack Hubakje, his own country which was ruled by his son, who exiled him. and King Taejo first sent him to King Mu and General Park Soul-hee. The Cheonan was the base where the late Baekhwa Army crossed Chupungnyeong and entered the area of Gungcheon and Chilgok via Gimcheon and Seonsan. In September, Taejo himself led the 3rd Army and joined the army to advance to Ilseon County 02. At this time, two armies camped with Ilicheon between them. The Korean Army had the largest number of fighting troops among the three kingdoms, with a total of 87,500 including 40,000 horses, 23,000 infantry, 9,800 cavalry, and 14,700 soldiers from various provinces. Taejo forced Gong Jin to hit the center of Hu Baek-je right after his victory, and the third division advanced to attack him, and the latter lost the post. The Hubaekjae forces were devastated by internal strife as the leadership collapsed. 3,200 people were captured and 5,700 killed, including General Swang and Gendal. Battle of Ilicheon was a fierce battle that led to the last fate of Goryeo and Hubaekje. In this battle, Hobaekje was defeated and destroyed, leading Wang Geon to unify his kingdom.  Later Goguryeo (HuGoguryeo)  = Foundation = It was founded in 901 by Gungye and remained for 18 years until it was destroyed by Wang Geon in 918. During the reign of King Jinsung, Silla's national power declined rapidly and its control was weakened. When the finances were weakened, taxes were pressed, leading to a rebellion. At this time, Gungye set up a new kingdom of later Goguryeo in the name of Goguryeo's revival, and later changed the name to Taebong. Taebong was later destroyed by Wang Geon and subsequently established as Goryeo. In modern times, Taebong is sometimes referred to as the Later Goguryeo = National leader = Gung Ye was a Buddhist monk who joined the political uprisings and became a prominent general of rebel troops. He is believed to come from a royal or noble background. Some historians theorize that he was descended from Go Anseung, a member of the Goguryeo royal family, who was given the \\"Kim\\" royal surname of Silla. Gung Ye conquered many territories including Myeongju (), and with the support of many regional leaders, including general Wang Geon, founded Later Goguryeo in the northern regions in 901. The northern regions, including Songak (modern Kaesong), were the strongholds of Goguryeo refugees, and Wang Geon's hometown of Songak was established as the capital. In 904, the name of the kingdom was changed to Majin; in 905, the capital was moved to Cheorwon; and in 911, the name was changed to Taebong. = Development and expansion = In the late eighth century, the power struggle between the central nobility grew fierce as national discipline became slack in Silla. As control over the provinces weakened, the countryside grew into a powerful group with military power, economic power, and new ideas. The nobles, who had secured economic and military power, fought for the throne. Local forces continued to grow in this confusion. And some nobles who felt problems with the hierarchy began to join forces with local forces. Gungye was one of the local forces that grew up in the late Silla Dynasty. Silla's power was weakened by these local forces as it entered the 10th century, resulting in new countries appearing. Gungye became a subordinate of Yanggil in 892 and gained his trust and attacked various parts of Gangwon Province. For many years, he increased his power and occupied the Imjin River area, and laid his own foundation. In 898, he entered Songak County and founded the foundation of self-reliance. Around this time, Wang Geon came under Gongye's command. He was given the official title of Cheorwon Taesu, took his land against Yanggil of Bukhwon, and named himself a king in 901 years, calling the name \\" Goryeo. \\" It moved its capital to Cheorwon in 905 and changed its national name to Taebong in 911. With Cheorwon at the center, Gungye occupied most of the Gangwon, Gyeonggi and Yellow Sea and parts of the Chungcheong provinces, creating a greater power than the Hubaekje and Silla. Taebong continued to invade the northern part of Silla. At the same time, it took Naju by forcing Wang Geon to lead the army and invade Hubaekje from the West Sea. = Cultural heritage = Gungye was originally a Buddhist monk, and even after taking power, he lived in Buddhist style. Seokdeungnong (ÏÑùÎì±Î°±, Áü≥ÁáàÁ±†, Stone lantern) that he left behind or the event that hosted the Palgwanhoe (ÌåîÍ¥ÄÌöå, ÂÖ´ÈóúÊúÉ) also affected Goryeo. As most of the area is currently located near the DMZ in Cheorwon County, it is difficult to investigate due to the special situation of division. = Wang Geon's coup = The influence of the nobles was reduced by Gongye's checks and popular policy. In 918, four of Gongye's aides discussed and appointed Wang Geon as the king and launched a coup. While fleeing to Gangneung, he met Wang Geon-geon's attack army and lost and killed himself. Goryeosa says he was beaten to death. Legend has it that he lost the battle and killed himself. In other places, Gungye reportedly tried to strengthen the royal authority against the nobles, but was expelled for failure.  Silla  In 672, Silla unified the three kingdoms by winning the war against the Tang Dynasty. It became the first country to unify its territory on the Korean Peninsula. After accepting the people of Goguryeo and Baekje and winning the war against the Tang Dynasty, they achieved true unification of the three kingdoms. Later, he worked hard to bring Baekje and Goguryeo's people into Silla by organizing internal policies, and during the mid- Silla Dynasty, he gained a powerful national power. However, as he entered the latter phase of the Silla Dynasty, his national power began to weaken due to many social chaos. = Among the Buddhist sects, Zen Buddhism and theory of divination based on topography are popular. = In the early days of Silla, among the Buddhist sects, the trend changed from 'Non-Zen Buddhism' to 'Zen'. Zen claimed a Buddhist revelation. And \\"Zen\\" focused on building character, leaving a complicated doctrine. It was on the opposite side of non-Zen Buddhism. When Seondeok was queen, Zen first came to Silla. I didn't get much understanding at first. However, it started to spread gradually from the time of King 'Heondeok. It can be said that Zen provided the local people with an ideological basis for independence. Eventually, it led to the collapse of Silla. And theory of divination based on topography is very popular. This was the mixture of knowledge of human geography and the theory of prophetic reference. The main contributor to this was the Buddhist monk, \\" Doseon, \\" who was active in the late 9th century. He argued that the terrain and geometry were closely related to the pathogenesis of the state or individual. Therefore, he argued that a site should be chosen to build a base or a house and a tomb. Then he argued that the country or individuals could enjoy happiness. The capital of Gyeongju, which is already unified in Silla, has to be thrown away and moved to another place. The other place is Songak, which is located in Wanggan. These new ideas were very important to the powerful family preparing for a new era. = Silla's bone-rank system = Silla's bone-rank system caused the following structural problems. The first is the problem of the operation of closed identity systems. In an atmosphere where anyone from the \\" Jingol \\" aristocracy could ascend the throne by talent, the bone-rank system could no longer maintain its realistic management ability. Second, the Silla ruling system based on the bone-rank system can be regarded as the central system of part 6. However, with the growth of the local community, the management of a system centered on Gyeongju was reaching the limit. Third, it is a variation of the family. A family of relatives is the basic unit of the Silla society. Silla's bone-rank status system, political and economic domination were also operated by family groups. However, by the time of the Silla Dynasty, the size and nature of the family were divided into smaller units. This means that it is no longer possible for a family of relatives to function as a basic unit of social organization. Fourth is the collapse of the Silla economic system. In the end, the confusion in the Silla kingdom revealed the structural contradictions of the bone-rank system and the limitations of its operating principles. = Social and economic life = The Silla society was based on the \\"bone-rank\\" system. Silla society was an aristocratic society that fixed political and social status. After the unification of three nations, Nobles with economic wealth and nobles with many slaves, livestock, and soldiers also appeared. After the unification, as the population increased and the living improved, the reclamation project was extensively promoted. Especially, at the time of the King of the Sinmun, the factory department was established and the handicrafts developed. A handiwork, lacquerware inlaid with mother-of pearl, bamboo ware were produced. They were exported to Japan and the Tang Dynasty. Therefore, construction trade was developed. Most of the exports to Tang are gold, silver, and ginseng. On the other hand, imports were various silk, clothes, stationery, books. Such economic development was noble. These statistics are surveyed for accurate tax collection from farmers and convenience of mobilization of work. At that time, the nobles made their lives at the expense of low status. Therefore, the political and social disruption of the end of Silla became more intense. The fundamental causes of the collapse of Silla society are as follows. This is because it has not solved the contradiction that fixed the status of social status. However, social stability was not possible because the rulers tried to correct social discipline by discriminating social order through power and identity discrimination. On the contrary, it brought the sociopath together. As a result, the Silla community, which lost its center, could not overcome the political crisis. = Decline of Silla = From the viewpoint of the power structure, the aristocratic nobles join forces with the royal family. And each of them has its own private military forces, so it can be said that it is the age of aristocratic coalition or division. However, if expand it nationwide, it can be grasped as the time when the local barbarian forces were rising. Kim yang sang, an advocate of this era, became the king of Seondeok after the death of King Hye - kyung. However, he failed to resolve the political and social contradictions of the revolutionary and died within five years of his reign. Kim Kyung-shin, who won the throne competition, was crowned. He became the King of Wonsong. He initiated political reform in 788. However, the reorganization of the power structure centered on the immediate family of the royal family caused dissatisfaction with the nobility. After that, the king 's uncle Kim un-seong was regent. And through the revision of the ordinance and the establishment of the system of ordination, he tried to strengthen the power structure that had begun to form in the future. In addition, Kim un-seong murdered the king, and such efforts were further promoted. As a result, dissatisfaction with aristocratic nobles alienated from the royal centered political system grew. So in 822, Kim Hun-chang led a revolt in the Unchon state. This rebellion was suppressed within a short period of time. However, it is important to note that the local tribal tendency of the 'powerful local family' was greatly promoted. Later, in the period of King Heungdeok, reform politics regulating the social life of the Noble was carried out. There are many questions about its effectiveness. Moreover, after his death, a war of succession took place among the nearest royal families. Thus, two kings were sacrificed over three years. During this period, the local powerful family forces gradually grew. And they have the capacity to overwhelm the royal family in the future. The maritime powers like Jang Bogo were remarkable. 'Cheonhaejin' was established by Jang Bogo, who returned from the Tang Dynasty in 828. He cleared the pirate with a thousand troops, so he took over the sea. He also supervised the trade between Silla, Tang and Japan. So he reigned as the king of the sea. He entered the central political arena based on maritime forces. He exercised his mighty power and gave his daughter to King Mun sung. On the other hand, he failed to solidify his political base and caused rebellion, but he was assassinated. After that, in the time of King Kyungmun and Hunghang, efforts to regain the kingdom were constantly tried. However, it is too late to make up for the big picture. And when Queen Jinseong succeeded King Jung-kang, the situation became desperate. So the national finance faced a breakdown. In 889, the adjustment prompted taxation to the provincial governor to overcome the financial crisis, causing farmers' insurrection. In the end, the government failed to resolve the issue. This led to a long period of civil war. = Destruction of Silla = King Sindeok, King Gyeongmyeong, and King Myung-eup reigned for 15 years (912 to 927) in their third generations. During this time, Silla was unable to control local forces. During this confusing period, Gyeon Hwon's Hubaekje and Gungye's Later Goguryeo appeared. After killing Gungye, Wang Geon founded Goryeo. King Taejo of Goryeo, who had defeated Gongye of Goguryeo, presented an aggressive friendship policy toward Silla. His friendly policies toward Silla were useful in conversing the Silla people. In fact, King Taejo dispatched Goryeo troops to the Silla kingdom to help Silla and fight back with Later Baekje (HuBaekje) army when Hubaekje attacked Silla. As a result, King Gyeongsun's voluntary surrender was easily accepted to conquer Silla. Unification of the Later Three Kingdoms Although Later Baekje started out as the front-runner in national strength thanks to its fertile plains and diplomatic ties with China, Later Goguryeo soon became the largest force in the new three kingdom era as it quickly expanded its territory to almost three quarters of the peninsula under Gung Ye and the general Wang Geon. As time passed, however, Gung Ye started to call himself the Maitreya Buddha and resort to despotism, causing him to be overthrown by Wang Geon in 918.Korea through the Ages Vol. 1 pp 110-113 Wang Geon established a new dynasty called Goryeo and moved the capital to Song-ak (hangul:ÏÜ°ÏïÖ, hanja:ÊùæÂ∂Ω) the following year, creating the new troika of Goryeo, Baekje and Silla. Goryeo Taejo at Doosan Encyclopedia The three kingdoms were in a constant power struggle, although by this time Silla had weakened to a despondent state and did not pose much of a threat to the other two nations. Later Baekje led with an offensive approach but Wang Geon of Goryeo placed more importance on diplomatic ties, which endeared his kingdom to Silla. The conflict between Later Baekje and Goryeo was constant near Silla territory, as both countries wanted to wield their power over the region. Later Baekje led by attacking Gyeongju, the capital of Silla, in 927 and crushing the Goryeo army.Korea through the Ages Vol. 1 p113 Goryeo retaliated by winning the battle of Gochang in 930 and reclaiming the territory of Ungjin in 934. In 935, King Gyeongsun of a very weakened Silla surrendered to Goryeo. During this time, inner power struggles within Hubaekje weaken a country already fatigued from warfare. Gyeon Hwon named his youngest son Geumgang as heir, but his other sons (by a previous wife) joined forces and rebelled, placing Gyeon Hwon's eldest son Singeom on the throne and confining Gyeon Hwon to Geumsan Temple. Gyeon Hwon later escaped to Goryeo and joined forces with Wang Geon's army to attack the very country he founded. Later Baekje fell to Goryeo in 936 and the peninsula was reunified.

Here we have \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\oint_{C} {f'(z) \\\\over f(z)}\\\\, dz=4-5. In complex analysis, the argument principle (or Cauchy's argument principle) relates the difference between the number of zeros and poles of a meromorphic function to a contour integral of the function's logarithmic derivative. Specifically, if f(z) is a meromorphic function inside and on some closed contour C, and f has no zeros or poles on C, then : \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\oint_{C} {f'(z) \\\\over f(z)}\\\\, dz=Z-P where Z and P denote respectively the number of zeros and poles of f(z) inside the contour C, with each zero and pole counted as many times as its multiplicity and order, respectively, indicate. This statement of the theorem assumes that the contour C is simple, that is, without self-intersections, and that it is oriented counter-clockwise. More generally, suppose that f(z) is a meromorphic function on an open set Œ© in the complex plane and that C is a closed curve in Œ© which avoids all zeros and poles of f and is contractible to a point inside Œ©. For each point z ‚àà Œ©, let n(C,z) be the winding number of C around z. Then :\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\oint_{C} \\\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}\\\\, dz = \\\\sum_a n(C,a) - \\\\sum_b n(C,b) where the first summation is over all zeros a of f counted with their multiplicities, and the second summation is over the poles b of f counted with their orders. Interpretation of the contour integral The contour integral \\\\oint_{C} \\\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}\\\\, dz can be interpreted as 2œÄi times the winding number of the path f(C) around the origin, using the substitution w = f(z): :\\\\oint_{C} \\\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}\\\\, dz = \\\\oint_{f(C)} \\\\frac{1}{w}\\\\, dw That is, it is i times the total change in the argument of f(z) as z travels around C, explaining the name of the theorem; this follows from :\\\\frac{d}{dz}\\\\log(f(z))=\\\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} and the relation between arguments and logarithms. Proof of the argument principle Let zZ be a zero of f. We can write f(z) = (z ‚àí zZ)kg(z) where k is the multiplicity of the zero, and thus g(zZ) ‚â† 0\\\\. We get : f'(z)=k(z-z_Z)^{k-1}g(z)+(z-z_Z)^kg'(z)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and : {f'(z)\\\\over f(z)}={k \\\\over z-z_Z}+{g'(z)\\\\over g(z)}. Since g(zZ) ‚â† 0, it follows that g' (z)/g(z) has no singularities at zZ, and thus is analytic at zZ, which implies that the residue of f‚Ä≤(z)/f(z) at zZ is k. Let zP be a pole of f. We can write f(z) = (z ‚àí zP)‚àímh(z) where m is the order of the pole, and h(zP) ‚â† 0. Then, : f'(z)=-m(z-z_P)^{-m-1}h(z)+(z-z_P)^{-m}h'(z)\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. and : {f'(z)\\\\over f(z)}={-m \\\\over z-z_P}+{h'(z)\\\\over h(z)} similarly as above. It follows that h‚Ä≤(z)/h(z) has no singularities at zP since h(zP) ‚â† 0 and thus it is analytic at zP. We find that the residue of f‚Ä≤(z)/f(z) at zP is ‚àím. Putting these together, each zero zZ of multiplicity k of f creates a simple pole for f‚Ä≤(z)/f(z) with the residue being k, and each pole zP of order m of f creates a simple pole for f‚Ä≤(z)/f(z) with the residue being ‚àím. (Here, by a simple pole we mean a pole of order one.) In addition, it can be shown that f‚Ä≤(z)/f(z) has no other poles, and so no other residues. By the residue theorem we have that the integral about C is the product of 2œÄi and the sum of the residues. Together, the sum of the k 's for each zero zZ is the number of zeros counting multiplicities of the zeros, and likewise for the poles, and so we have our result. Applications and consequences The argument principle can be used to efficiently locate zeros or poles of meromorphic functions on a computer. Even with rounding errors, the expression {1\\\\over 2\\\\pi i}\\\\oint_{C} {f'(z) \\\\over f(z)}\\\\, dz will yield results close to an integer; by determining these integers for different contours C one can obtain information about the location of the zeros and poles. Numerical tests of the Riemann hypothesis use this technique to get an upper bound for the number of zeros of Riemann's \\\\xi(s) function inside a rectangle intersecting the critical line. The proof of Rouch√©'s theorem uses the argument principle. Modern books on feedback control theory quite frequently use the argument principle to serve as the theoretical basis of the Nyquist stability criterion. A consequence of the more general formulation of the argument principle is that, under the same hypothesis, if g is an analytic function in Œ©, then : \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\oint_C g(z)\\\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}\\\\, dz = \\\\sum_a n(C,a)g(a) - \\\\sum_b n(C,b)g(b). For example, if f is a polynomial having zeros z1, ..., zp inside a simple contour C, and g(z) = zk, then : \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i} \\\\oint_C z^k\\\\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)}\\\\, dz = z_1^k+z_2^k+\\\\cdots+z_p^k, is power sum symmetric polynomial of the roots of f. Another consequence is if we compute the complex integral: : \\\\oint_C f(z){g'(z) \\\\over g(z)}\\\\, dz for an appropriate choice of g and f we have the Abel‚ÄìPlana formula: : \\\\sum_{n=0}^{\\\\infty}f(n)-\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty}f(x)\\\\,dx= f(0)/2+i\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{f(it)-f(-it)}{e^{2\\\\pi t}-1}\\\\, dt which expresses the relationship between a discrete sum and its integral. Generalized argument principle There is an immediate generalization of the argument principle. Suppose that g is analytic in the region \\\\Omega. Then : \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\pi i}\\\\oint_{C} {f'(z) \\\\over f(z)} g(z) \\\\, dz = \\\\sum_a g(a) n(C,a) - \\\\sum_b g(b) n(C,b) where the first summation is again over all zeros a of f counted with their multiplicities, and the second summation is again over the poles b of f counted with their orders. History According to the book by Frank Smithies (Cauchy and the Creation of Complex Function Theory, Cambridge University Press, 1997, p. 177), Augustin-Louis Cauchy presented a theorem similar to the above on 27 November 1831, during his self-imposed exile in Turin (then capital of the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia) away from France. However, according to this book, only zeroes were mentioned, not poles. This theorem by Cauchy was only published many years later in 1874 in a hand- written form and so is quite difficult to read. Cauchy published a paper with a discussion on both zeroes and poles in 1855, two years before his death.

Bottle volume 50cl. The highly recognizable label on the bottle depicts a Cossack on a horse. The original Kubanskaya was produced by the renowned Kristall vodka factory in Moscow, the origin of Stolichnaya vodka. The beverage became insanely popular among expatriates living in Moscow during the 1990s, due to its pleasant taste and the relatively low hangover risk. Another major factor leading to this popularity was the cult song Kubanskaya by the Zelenograd rock group NTO Retsept . This song, in turn, was inspired by the brief cameo this vodka made in the underground novel Moscow- Petushki. The 1998 Russian financial crisis triggered an exodus of the Moscow expats. Consequently, Kristall ceased production of Kubanskaya. Kubanskaya vodka is still for sale in Russian stores, but is produced by less-known factories.

In her quest to foster an Australian \\"national art\\", she was also one of the first non-Indigenous Australian artists to use Aboriginal motifs in her work. Early life and education Margaret Rose Preston was born on 29 April 1875 in Port Adelaide to David McPherson, a Scottish marine engineer, and Prudence McPherson. She was the first-born child; her sister Ethelwynne was born in 1877. The family called Margaret by her middle name (Rose), and it was only in her mid 30s that she began to use Margaret. Preston's family moved to Sydney in 1885, where Preston attended Fort Street Girls' High School for two years. She showed an early interest in art, first with china painting and then through private art classes with William Lister Lister. Preston would later, at the age of 52, write about her childhood and developing interest in art in the article \\"From Eggs to Electrolux,\\" which ran in Sydney Ure Smith's Art in Australia in 1927. Although written in the third person, it offers glimpses of her legendarily strong personality. She describes her first visit to the Art Gallery of New South Wales at the age of 12, recalling it as :\\"a big, quiet, nice smelling place with a lot of pictures hanging on the walls and here and there students sitting on high stools copying at easels. [My] first impression was not of the beauty of wonder of the pictures, but how nice it must be to sit on a high stool with people giving you 'looks' as they went by... This visit led [me] to the decision to be an artist.\\" Following her classes with Lister, Preston went on to study at the National Gallery of Victoria Art School under Frederick McCubbin from 1889 to 1894. Her studies were interrupted for a time in 1894‚Äì95 by her father's illness and death. When she returned to the school, she began working with Bernard Hall. She showed a strong preference for painting still lifes instead of people, and in 1897, she won the school's Still Life Scholarship, which afforded her a year's free tuition. In 1898, she transferred to Adelaide's School of Design, where she studied under H. P. Gill and Hans Heysen. Teaching Early in Preston's career‚Äîespecially before her marriage‚Äîshe taught art to help support herself and her family. She began taking on private students while she was still at Adelaide's School of Design, setting up her own studio in 1899. She later taught at St Peter's College and at Presbyterian Ladies' College, both in Adelaide. Among her students were such notable artists as Bessie Davidson, Gladys Reynell, and Stella Bowen, who referred to her as \\"a red-headed little firebrand of a woman, who was not only an excellent painter, but a most inspiring teacher\\". Gladys Reynell and Stella Bowen attended her classes in 1908. Art career =Traveling years (1904‚Äì1907; 1912)= After her mother died in 1903, Preston and Bessie Davidson traveled to Europe, where they stayed from 1904 to 1907, with sojourns in Munich and Paris and shorter trips to Italy, Spain, Holland, and Africa. In Munich, Preston briefly studied at the Government Art School for Women but was not taken with either German teaching methods or German aesthetics. She later commented, \\"Half of German art is mad and vicious, and a good deal is dull.\\" Paris suited Preston better, and she took part in the Paris Salon of 1905 and 1906. Her developing Modernist sensibility was influenced by French Postimpressionists such as Paul C√©zanne, Paul Gauguin, and Henri Matisse as well as by Japanese art and design, which she encountered at the Mus√©e Guimet. From Japanese art in particular she acquired a preference for asymmetrical composition, a focus on plants as subject matter, and an appreciation of pattern as an organizing method. She began to try to reduce her own work to \\"decoration without ornamentation\\". Returning to Australia in 1907, Preston leased a studio with Bessie Davidson, and they put on a joint exhibition from which one of her paintings Onions (1905), was bought by the National Gallery of South Australia. In 1911, Preston was asked to paint a portrait of Catherine Spence for the National Gallery of South Australia. Preston went back to France (Paris and Brittany) in 1912 with Gladys Reynell, but when World War I broke out, they moved to Great Britain. There Preston studied pottery and the principles of Modernist design at Roger Fry's Omega Workshops. Later, she and Reynell taught pottery and basket-weaving as therapy for shell-shocked soldiers at the Seale Hayne Military Hospital in Devonshire. She exhibited her work in both London and Paris during this period. From these European studies, Preston returned to Australia having adopted Modernist principles. The Modernists' analytical approach to design, sense of underlying form, and simplified pictorial space would all become hallmarks of her work. The influence of her European studies can be seen, for example, in her 1927 still life Implement Blue, with its geometric forms, muted palette, and stark lighting. =Early Mosman years (1919‚Äì1932)= In 1919, Preston went to America for an exhibition at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. On her way back to Australia, she met her future husband, William George \\"Bill\\" Preston, a recently discharged second lieutenant of the Australian Imperial Force. She married her husband on 31 December 1919, and wrote a false birthdate on her marriage certificate to make herself eight years younger than her husband. Bill had a placid temperament that complemented Margaret Preston's assertive personality, and they were devoted to each other throughout their marriage. Preston's friend Leon Gellert noted that Bill seemed to regard it as a national duty to keep his beloved Margaret happy and artistically productive. A successful businessman, Bill Preston was a company director for Anthony Horderns retailers, Dalton's packaging company and later, Tooheys Brewery. Their marriage gave Margaret the financial security to pursue her work and travel extensively. The Prestons settled in the Sydney suburb of Mosman following their marriage in late December 1919. A harbor town, Mosman has long attracted artists and writers such as Tom Roberts, Arthur Streeton, Harold Herbert, Dattilo Rubbo, Lloyd Rees, Nancy Borlase, and Ken Done. The Prestons would live in Mosman from 1920 to 1963, with the exception of seven years in the bush suburb of Berowra during the 1930s. It was during the Mosman period that Preston became established as the most prominent Australian woman artist of the 1920s and 1930s. Within a year of the move to Mosman, the Art Gallery of New South Wales bought her 1915 painting Summer, at the 1920 Royal Art Society Spring exhibition. Preston was a founding member of the Contemporary Group in 1926. In 1929 the trustees of what is now the Art Gallery of New South Wales commissioned Self portrait (1930) ‚Äì the first such commission to a woman artist from the Gallery. In the 1930s, she joined the Anthropological Society of New South Wales. Preston joined the Society of Artists and became a friend of its president, Sydney Ure Smith, the influential editor and publisher of Art in Australia, The Home, and Australia National Journal. Writing in Ure Smith‚Äôs publications, Preston advocated for her own ideas about Australian art, especially the need to develop a national identity in art rather than endlessly imitating European models. All told, she contributed several dozen articles on art to Ure Smith‚Äôs publications as well as to the Society of Artists yearbooks. Not only did Ure Smith give more space to Preston than to any other artist, he devoted three issues to her work exclusively: the Margaret Preston Number of Art in Australia (1927), Recent Paintings by Margaret Preston (1929), and Margaret Preston‚Äôs Monotypes (1949). Preston also capitalized on the forum that women's magazines provided in allowing her to reach a wide audience for both her work and her opinions on the future of Australian art. Readers of the April 1929 edition of Woman's World were prodded to keep the covers of issues on which Preston's works had been reproduced and to frame them as pictures. Prints Even more than her paintings, Preston‚Äôs woodcuts, linocuts, and monotypes show her capacity for Modernist innovation. Although she had experimented with etching while living in England, the best of her mature work was in woodcuts. These prints were inexpensive to produce and helped her to extend her reach to a broader market. Preston created over 400 known prints, not all of which are documented and some of which are lost. The great majority of surviving prints feature Australian native flora as their subjects, a result of Preston‚Äôs desire to make uniquely Australian images. Flowers such as the banksia, waratah, gum blossom and wheelflower offered Preston specimens for her radical, asymmetrical compositions. Mosman and its environs also featured in many of Preston's prints. One of the Prestons' flats (in Musgrave Street) afforded views of Mosman Bay and Mosman Bridge that turned up in more than half a dozen different prints. Another flat, near Reid Park, had views of Sydney Harbor and its foreshore that featured in such iconic works as Sydney Head I (1925), Sydney Head II (1925), and Harbour Foreshore (1925). The harbour also appears in the works Circular Quay (1925) and The Bridge from the North Shore (1932). There are also prints with landscape subjects, such as Red Cross Fete (1920)‚Äîa view across the water from Balmoral Island at night‚Äîand Edwards Beach Balmoral (1929) and Rocks and Waves (1929), which are both views from Wyargine Point near Edwards Beach. Preston liked to experiment with new techniques, although her most usual approach was to print her images in black with added hand colouring. She felt that printmaking helped to keep her work fresh, writing: \\"Whenever I thought I was slipping in my art, I went into crafts‚Äìwoodcuts, monotypes, stencils and etchings. I find it clears my brain.\\" Paintings Mosman also features in many Preston paintings that are not still life works. Two in particular‚ÄîJapanese Submarine Exhibition (1942) and Children‚Äôs Corner at the Zoo (1944‚Äì46)‚Äîare painted in a deliberately naive style, reflecting a then-current interest in children's art. Preston would probably have seen a 1939 Department of Education Gallery exhibition of children‚Äôs art, and she would have been aware of Roger Fry‚Äôs theories on creativity and learning in children. Japanese Submarine Exhibition offers a wry look at that paranoia and anti-Japanese sentiments of the war years in Australia. =Berowra years (1932‚Äì1939)= Between 1932 and 1939, the Prestons lived in the bush suburb of Berowra. While living in Berowra, the Preston's had two terrier dogs. It was here that Preston pursued most intensively her concern for the development of a national identity in Australian art. She turned to Australian Indigenous art as an inspiration, deploying Aboriginal design motifs and natural-pigment color schemes in her work. This tendency continued even after she left Berowra and can be seen in such later works such as The Brown Pot (1940) and Manly Pines (1953). Preston won a silver medal at the Exposition Internationale, Paris in 1937. =Return to Mosman (1939‚Äì1963)= Following their seven years in Berowra, the Prestons returned to Mosman, where they would stay until Margaret Preston's death on 28 May 1963. Among their homes during this period were the former home of actress Nellie Stewart and the Hotel Mosman. Preston's later works built on the Aboriginal themes developed at Berowra, and her very last works had overtly religious themes, possibly in response to the Blake Prize instituted in 1951. In the 1950s, she made a series of gouache stencils based on religious subjects. = Work = From December 2004 to April 2005, her work was exhibited at the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra. Other galleries that hold collections of her work include the Queensland Art Gallery, the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, the Art Gallery of South Australia, and the National Gallery of Victoria.

Cornforth investigated enzymes that catalyse changes in organic compounds, the substrates, by taking the place of hydrogen atoms in a substrate's chains and rings. In his syntheses and descriptions of the structure of various terpenes, olefins, and steroids, Cornforth determined specifically which cluster of hydrogen atoms in a substrate were replaced by an enzyme to effect a given change in the substrate, allowing him to detail the biosynthesis of cholesterol.Deaf Scientist Corner ‚Äì John Warcup Cornforth, Texas Woman's University For this work, he won a share of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1975, alongside co-recipient Vladimir Prelog, and was knighted in 1977. Early life and family Born in Sydney, Cornforth was the son and the second of four children of English-born, Oxford-educated schoolmaster and teacher John Warcup Cornforth and Hilda Eipper (1887‚Äì1969), a granddaughter of pioneering missionary and Presbyterian minister Christopher Eipper. Before her marriage, Eipper had been a maternity nurse. Cornforth was raised in Sydney as well as Armidale, in the north of New South Wales, where he undertook primary school education. At about 10 years old, Cornforth had noted signs of deafness, which led to a diagnosis of otosclerosis, a disease of the middle ear which causes progressive hearing loss. This would leave him completely deaf by the age of 20 but also fatefully influence his career direction towards chemistry.John Cornforth , biotechnology-innovation.com.au Education Cornforth was educated at Sydney Boys' High School, where he excelled academically, passed tests in English, mathematics, science, French, Greek, and Latin, and was inspired by his chemistry teacher, Leonard (\\"Len\\") Basser, to change his career directions from law to chemistry. Cornforth graduated as the dux of the class of 1933 at Sydney Boys' High School, at the age of 16. In 1934, Cornforth matriculated and studied at the University of Sydney, where he studied organic chemistry at the University of Sydney's School of Chemistry and from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Science with First-Class Honours and the University Medal in 1937. During his studies, his hearing became progressively worse, thus making listening to lectures difficult. At the time, he could not use hearing aids as the sound became distorted, and he did not significantly use lip reading. While studying at the University of Sydney, Cornforth met his future wife, fellow chemist and scientific collaborator, Rita Harradence. Harradence was a graduate of St George Girls High School and a distinguished academic achiever who had topped the state in Chemistry in the New South Wales Leaving Certificate Examination. Harradence graduated with a Bachelor of Science with First-Class Honours and the University Medal in Organic Chemistry in 1936, a year ahead of Cornforth. Harradence also graduated with a MSc in 1937, writing a master's thesis titled \\"Attempts to synthesise the pyridine analogue of vitamin B1\\". In 1939, Cornforth and Harradence, independently of each other, each won one of two Science Research Scholarships (the 1851 Research Fellowship) from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, tenable overseas for two years. At the University of Oxford, Harradence was a member of Somerville College while Cornforth was at St. Catherine's College and they worked with Sir Robert Robinson, with whom they would collaborate for 14 years. During his time at Oxford, Cornforth found working for and with Robinson stimulating, and the two would often deliberate to no end until one had a cogent case against the other's counterargument. In 1941, Cornforth and Harradence both graduated with a D.Phil. in Organic Chemistry. At the time, there were no institutions or facilities at which a PhD in chemistry could be done in Australia. Career After his arrival at Oxford and during World War II, Cornforth significantly influenced the work on penicillin, particularly in purifying and concentrating it. Penicillin is usually very unstable in its crude form; as a consequence of this, researchers at the time were building upon Howard Florey's work on the drug. In 1940, Cornforth and other chemists measured the yield of penicillin in arbitrary units to understand the conditions that favoured penicillin production and activity, and he contributed to the writing of The Chemistry of Penicillin. In 1946, the Cornforths, who had by now married, left Oxford and joined the Medical Research Council (MRC), working at the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR), where they continued on earlier work in synthesising sterols, including cholesterol. The Cornforths' collaboration with Robinson continued and flourished. In 1951, they completed, simultaneously with Robert Burns Woodward, the first total synthesis of the non-aromatic steroids. At the NIMR, Cornforth collaborated with numerous biological scientists, including George Popj√°k, with whom he shared an interest in cholesterol. Together, they received the Davy Medal in 1968 in recognition of their distinguished joint work on the elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway to polyisoprenoids and steroids. While working at the MRC, Cornforth was appointed a Professor at the University of Warwick and was employed there from 1965 to 1971. In 1975, Cornforth was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, alongside Vladimir Prelog. In his acceptance speech, Cornforth said: Also in 1975, he moved to the University of Sussex in Brighton as a Royal Society Research Professor. Cornforth remained there as a professor and was active in research until his death. Personal life In 1941, the year in which they graduated from the University of Oxford, Cornforth married Rita Harriet Harradence (b. 1915), with whom he would have one son, John, and two daughters, Brenda and Philippa. Cornforth had met Harradence after she had broken a Claisen flask in their second year at the University of Sydney; Cornforth, with his expertise of glassblowing and the use of a blowpipe, mended the break. Rita Cornforth died on 6 November 2012, at home with her family around her, following a long illness. On an important author or paper that was integral to his success, Cornforth stated that he was particularly impressed by the works of German chemist Hermann Emil Fischer. Cornforth died in Sussex on 8 December 2013. at the age of 96. Cornforth is survived by his three children and four grandchildren. He was a sceptic and an atheist. Honours and awards Cornforth was named the Australian of the Year in 1975,Australian of the Year Awards ‚Äì John Cornforth , Australian of the Year jointly with Maj. Gen. Alan Stretton. In 1977, Cornforth was recognised by his alma mater, the University of Sydney, with the award of an honorary Doctor of Science.

Life Schwabe was born in Altona, Holstein, and moved to Geneva, Switzerland at an early age, where he received the Swiss nationality. After studying art in Geneva, he relocated to Paris as a young man, where he worked as a wallpaper designer, and he became acquainted with Symbolist artists, musicians (Guillaume Lekeu, Vincent d'Indy) and writers. In 1892, he was one of the painters of the famous Salon de la Rose + Croix organized by Jos√©phin P√©ladan at the Galerie Durand- Ruel. His poster for the first Salon is an important symbolic work of the idealist new art. He exhibited at the Soci√©t√© nationale des Beaux-Arts, at the Salon d'automne and was present at the Exposition Universelle of 1900 (Gold Medal), but also in Munich, Z√ºrich, Vienna, and Brussels. His paintings typically featured mythological and allegorical themes with a very personal and idealist vision and a social interest. His important work La Vague (The Wave), and its preparatory drawings are a testimony of the engagement of the artist during the \\"Affaire dreyfus\\". Schwabe is one of the most important symbolist book illustrators. He illustrated the novel Le r√™ve (1892) by √âmile Zola, Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal (1900), Maurice Maeterlinck's Pell√©as et M√©lisande (1892), and Albert Samain's Jardin de l'infante (1908), but also texts by Haraucourt, Mallarm√©, Blondel, Mend√®s, Lamennais etc. The most important works by Schwabe belongs to the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris, the Mus√©e d'Art et d'Histoire in Geneva, the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes in Rio de Janeiro, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium in Brussels and in private collections. Schwabe received the French L√©gion of Honor in 1902. Schwabe lived in France for the rest of his life and died in Avon, Seine-et-Marne in 1926. Work Two distinct styles are recognized in Schwabe's art. Before 1900, Schwabe's paintings were more individual and experimental, indicating the idealism of the Symbolists; conventional, allegorical scenes from nature became more prominent in his later work. Images of women were important, sometimes representing death and suffering, other times creativity and guidance. His first wife was his model for angels and virgins, and \\"Death\\" in Death and the Grave Digger (1895) resembles her. The death of a close friend in 1894, the musician Guillaume Lekeu, when Schwabe was 28 years old, engendered his interest in representing death and the world of ideal creation. Schwabe created an important watercolor that was the model of a lithographic poster for the 1892 Salon de la Rose + Croix, the first of six exhibitions organized by Jos√©phin P√©ladan that demonstrated the Rosicrucian tendencies of French Symbolism. Schwabe's poster depicted in shades of blue an initiation rite‚Äîthree women ascending toward spiritual salvation‚Äîand is an exemplar of Rosicrucian art.

The Isuzu Piazza was marketed as the Isuzu Impulse in North America and as the Holden Piazza in Australia. The first generation Impulse was a rear-wheel drive car, and in the United Kingdom it was the first widely available Isuzu passenger car. The second generation was available as front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. It was the basis for the lower-priced Gemini Coup√©, known as the Geo Storm in the US market. As of 2010, the number of registered Impulses in North America totaled only 2,300, making Impulses very rare. The car was produced in very low numbers, totaling slightly over 13,000 units, with that number including the production of the Isuzu Stylus. __TOC__  1980‚Äì1990 (JR120/130)  Rear view of a Piazza Nero XJ (Japan) In 1978, Isuzu commissioned Giorgetto Giugiaro to design a new sporty car to replace the 117 Coupe (also a Giugiaro design). Accessed 13 February 2007. They delivered several T Series Chevettes (developed in 1973 in South America) to the Italdesign studio in Italy and allowed Giugiaro free rein over the design. The result of this effort was the wedge-shaped three-door hatchback called the Asso di Fiori (\\"Ace of Clubs\\") prototype and show car. It was shown at the 1979 Tokyo Motor Show to rave reviews. Giugiaro referred to the design as his fifth \\"Copernican revolution\\", integrating the design innovations of many different previous designs into one, mass producible, vehicle.Alfieri, Giugiaro Italdesign Catalogue Raisonn√© 1959‚Äì1987, Vol. 2, pp. 191‚Äì194. Accessed 13 February 2007. Within 48 hours of its unveiling at the Tokyo Motor Show, Isuzu fast tracked the vehicle into production with minimal changes to the design.Alfieri, Giugiaro Italdesign Catalogue Raisonn√© 1959‚Äì1987, Vol. 2, p. 216. Accessed 13 February 2007.\\"Isuzu Piazza\\", Car Styling Quarterly, Vol. 35, July 1981. Items that remained were the single blade front windshield wiper, and an integrated steering wheel adjustment that also moved the instrument cluster, with wiper controls and exterior lighting controls installed just behind the steering wheel on either side. The first Piazza rolled off the production line in September 1980Isuzu Piazza JR Parts Catalog 1980-1990, Isuzu Motors Ltd., PN 6-8871-0500-9 in Fujisawa, Japan, available with either , 2.0 L SOHC inline-four MPFI engine, a carryover from the Isuzu 117 Coup√©, or a , 2.0 L DOHC MPFI I4 engine. Five- speed manual and 4-speed automatic transmissions were available, and all models were rear-wheel drive. In April 1984, a , turbocharged SOHC I4 engine was introduced, and the DOHC naturally aspirated engine was phased out in years that followed. Piazzas were available in a multitude of trim levels including Bella, XN, XJ, XE, XG, Nero, and others. There were three different suspension tuning levels, standard, Irmscher, and Lotus.Isuzu Piazza, 117 Coupe, and Bellett GT. Tokyo, Japan: Neko Publishing Co. Ltd., 1998. . Production continued through 1990. Isuzu Impulse For the US market, this vehicle was introduced as the Impulse in 1983. For the 1983 and 1984 model years, only one engine was available, the 2.0 L SOHC I4 engine, rated at , . A MPFI turbocharged model was introduced in 1985, with a 2.0 L SOHC I4 engine rated at and . The 1987 model year had the RS model which came with a 4ZC1 turbo engine. The 1988 model year saw several changes. Mild exterior and interior changes were made to the appearance of the vehicle (including a larger rear spoiler and fixed headlights without pop up covers). The 2.0 L non-turbo engine was replaced with a 2.3 L SOHC I4 engine, rated at , 127 lb¬∑ft The 2.3 L engine was offered only in the US market, because the larger engine would have obligated Japanese consumers to pay more annual road tax, thereby affecting sales, as well as the larger engine conflicted with Japanese government regulations concerning maximum displacement for cars classified as \\"compact\\". All Impulses received a Lotus-tuned suspension beginning in the 1988 model year, which consisted of redesigned sway bars, stiffer dampers, and a change in previous spring rates. In the US market, the Impulse was marketed as \\"everything standard\\", meaning that all Impulses came with all available equipment for the vehicle's model year, and only two trim levels offered: non- turbo and Turbo. There were, however, some special edition models, most notably the RS model of the 1987 model year, available only in white body color with pewter color trim, and featuring the stiffest suspension available on any Impulse, very close to the Irmscher suspension sold only in Japan. For the 1989 model year, a Special Edition non-turbo model was offered which was equipped with the Turbo model wheels and interior trim. The vehicle was sold as the Piazza in Europe and Australia, though introduced into these markets in 1985 or later. In the UK the Piazza was sold in only one trim level and only Turbo form, with a 147 bhp 2.0 Turbocharged engine (4ZC1-T). The Piazza had a shaky start in the UK with the first importer Isuzu GB, based in Maidstone, Kent going out of business in 1986, and London car dealer Alan Day bought the remaining stock of Piazzas at a bargain price. These cars were sold by Alan Day at significantly reduced price; the main reason Isuzu GB went out of business was due to high unit price. In 1987 International Motors Group of West Bromwich (IM Group) were awarded the official Isuzu franchise for the UK. (They also at the time represented Subaru and Hyundai in the UK.) IM Group still marketed the Piazza in single trim/engine form, but they only sold the updated 'Lotus' Piazza. The earlier cars sold by Day became known as 'pre- Lotus' cars; the suspension and handling of these pre-Lotus cars was derided by UK Press as poor, especially the live axle arrangement at the rear, which by the late '80s was seen to be antiquated. The updated 'Handling by Lotus' car was available from 1987 and the handling, although keeping the live axle arrangement, was transfomed by Lotus in the UK after significant development work, involving modified suspension layouts, larger brakes, specially produced dampers and Goodyear tyres. The 'Handling by Lotus' cars had updated interior and exterior equipment. The exterior having a redesigned rear, with a large 'hoop' spoiler, new rear lamps, new rear badging with 'Handling by Lotus' badges and removal of the rubber side bumper strakes for a cleaner, more modern look. The updated interior trim was mainly 'tweed' check fabric, an updated centre console, but the loss of air conditioning to keep the price down for the UK market. The Piazza was marketed in Australia as the YB series Holden Piazza Isuzu (UK) Ltd, the West Bromwich-based importer, sold the Lotus Piazza from 1987 to 1989, before concentrating on the 4WD Isuzu Trooper. They never sold the second generation Piazza in the UK, nor was it sold in any European market. In Australia, the Piazza was introduced very late (April 1986), and offered only in Turbo form.Bebbington, Terry, and Michel A. Malik. 45 Years of Holden. The Australian Publishing and Printing Co. Distributed by Classic Motorbooks. . It was badged as a Holden Piazza.Holden Piazza sales brochure, General Motors-Holden's Sales Pty Ltd, March 1986 The first generation Piazza was replaced by the Opel Vectra based Holden Calibra in Australia. Performance of the Turbo model was comparable to the Mitsubishi Starion/Dodge Conquest, as demonstrated by the fact that the acceleration and handling numbers reported by the auto enthusiast magazines were within 0.1‚Äì0.2 seconds between the vehicles. In the US, the Impulse was replaced by the second generation Impulse after the end of the 1989 model year. However, in Japan, the first generation Piazza continued production and was available through the 1991 model year.  1990‚Äì1992 (1990‚Äì1991 and 1993 in Canada)  Isuzu Impulse RS Turbo, rear view The second generation Impulse was designed on General Motors's second generation R-body \\"world car\\" platform. GM had commissioned Isuzu to build a replacement for the Spectrum, this time a sportier model called the Storm (Gemini Coupe in Japan). The body design of the Storm was strongly influenced by GM and drew heavily from GM Europe's design submission for the Lotus Elan M100.Robinson, Graham. Lotus Since the 70's; Volume 1: Elite, Eclat, Excel, and Elan. Croydon, England: Motor Racing Publications Ltd., 1993. .Hughes, Mark. Osprey Automotive Lotus Elan. London: Osprey Publishing, 1992. . Under Shiro Nakamura,Gandini, Marzia. Bruno Alfieri, Editor. Shiro Nakamura, Nissan Design (Car Men 45). Automobilia s.r.l. Italy, 2003. . Isuzu's then head of design, the third generation Gemini sedan was first designed on this platform, and then attention was turned to a sporty coupe to replace the first generation Impulse. Starting with the Storm, alternative front and rear treatments were made, retaining the lozenge theme of the Gemini sedan, and drawing heavy influence from the rear-wheel drive Impulse (semi-concealed headlights with integrated grille as well as hood and taillight styling) while also expanding on the \\"European look\\", which later became a central point of marketing the vehicle in Japan. The three-door hatchback debuted as the Impulse XS in 1989 for the 1990 model year. It was offered only in front-wheel drive with a DOHC 1.6 L (1588 cc) I4 engine which produced 130 hp (97 kW) and 102 lb¬∑ft (138 Nm). The suspension consisted of MacPherson struts both front and rear, with a rigid trailing arm front suspension and a multi-link rear suspension, featuring Nishiboric passive steering. For the 1991 model year, the Impulse RS was introduced with a 160 hp (119 kW) and 150 lb¬∑ft (203 Nm) turbocharged engine and all-wheel drive drivetrain which featured rear viscous differential and center planetary differential and viscous coupling. The wagonback model was also introduced for the 1991 model year, only available with the normally aspirated 1.6 L engine. For the 1992 model year, the Turbo model was discontinued and the base engine was replaced with a 1.8 L (1809 cc) engine, sharing the same bore but with a longer stroke due to the taller engine block. This larger powerplant was good for 140 hp (104 kW) and 125 lb¬∑ft (169 Nm). Both body styles continued into 1992, but very few were produced. Since the Impulse weighed just 2411 lb (1094 kg) in front-wheel drive configuration and 2732 lb (1239 kg) in all-wheel drive configuration, the turbo engine and all-wheel drive combined gave excellent performance. General Motors, who owned nearly half of Isuzu, also owned Lotus Cars at the time. Lotus selected the 1.6-litre engine and transmission from the Isuzu Gemini for the Lotus Elan M100 and a following generation of that engine eventually ended up in the Impulse. Lotus was subcontracted by Isuzu to fine-tune the suspension of the Impulse, through selection of stiffer dampers, larger sway bars, and softer springs. All of the second generation Impulses had the Lotus-tuned suspension. A non-Lotus innovation in the Impulse was the development of the Nishiboric passive rear- wheel steering system which adjusted the toe of the rear wheels by changing the rear wheel alignment through the range of suspension travel. The combination of the burst of the Japanese economic bubble, rising emissions and crash safety requirements, and continued restrictive market segment changes by General Motors forced Isuzu out of the car making market and brought an end to the Impulse. 1993 As√ºna Sunfire In the Japanese market, this vehicle was sold as the Piazza from July 1991 through the spring of 1992. The second generation Piazza was offered only in front-wheel drive with the 1.8 L engine. All of the second generation Piazzas came with the Lotus-tuned suspension. The Japanese were also offered the Geo Storm version of the Piazza, called the Piazza PA- Nero. This model was exclusive to the Japanese import dealership network Yanase Co., Ltd., under a special arrangement that sold GM products in Japan. In Canada, the same models, with minor variations, were sold in the 1990 and 1991 model years. No Impulses were made for Canada for the 1992 model year. In 1993 the 1.8 L model was sold in Canada as the As√ºna Sunfire, but only with the hatchback body. With the phaseout of the As√ºna brand in 1993, the Sunfire name moved to a Pontiac, as its version of the third-generation Chevrolet Cavalier on the GM J platform rather than an Isuzu platform.

Location Tusculum was one of the largest Roman cities in the Alban Hills and today is amongst the largest ruins of a Roman city in the region. The Tusculum is located on Tuscolo hill on the northern edge of the outer crater rim of the Alban volcano. The volcano itself is located in the Alban Hills south of the present-day town of Frascati. Tuscolo Hills' summit is above sea level and affords a view of the Roman Campagna, with Rome lying to the north-west. Rome was reached by the Via Latina (from which a branch road ascended to Tusculum, while the main road passed through the valley to the south of it), or by the Via Labicana to the north. Tusculum was most famous in Roman times for the many great and luxurious patrician country villas sited close to the city, yet a comfortable distance from Rome (notably the villas of Cicero, Lucullus etc.). The Villa and Tomb of Lucullus at Tusculum, George McCracken, American Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 46, No. 3 (Jul. - Sep., 1942), pp. 325-340 Strabo wrote about Tusculum in Geography, V 3 ¬ß 12.: > But still closer to Rome than the mountainous country where these cities > lie, there is another ridge, which leaves a valley (the valley near Algidum) > between them and is high as far as Mount Albanus. It is on this chain that > Tusculum is situated, a city with no mean equipment of buildings; and it is > adorned by the plantings and villas encircling it, and particularly by those > that extend below the city in the general direction of the city of Rome; for > here Tusculum is a fertile and well-watered hill, which in many places rises > gently into crests and admits of magnificently devised royal palaces. History =Antiquity= According to legend, the city was founded either by Telegonus, the son of Odysseus and Circe, or by the Latin king Latinus Silvius, a descendant of Aeneas, who according to Titus Livius was the founder of most of the towns and cities in Latium. The geographer Filippo Cluverio discounts these legends, asserting that the city was founded by Latins about three hundred years before the Trojan War. Funerary urns datable to the 8th‚Äì7th centuries B.C. demonstrate a human presence in the late phases of Latin culture in this area. Tusculum is first mentioned in history as an independent city-state with a king, a constitution and gods of its own. When Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the last King of Rome, was expelled from the city in 509 B.C., he sought military help from his son-in-law Octavius Mamilius, one of the leading men of Tusculum. After the war between Clusium and Rome failed to win back the throne for Tarquinius, he sought refuge with Mamilius in Tusculum.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.15 The Mamilii claimed to be descended from Telegonus, the founder of the city. Mamilius commanded the army of the Latins against the Romans at the Battle of Lake Regillus, where he was killed in 498 B.C. This is the point at which Rome gained predominance among the Latin cities. According to some accounts Tusculum subsequently became an ally of Rome, incurring the frequent hostilities of the other Latin cities. In 460 B.C. the Sabines occupied the Capitol. Of the Latin cities, only Tusculum quickly sent troops, commanded by the dictator Lucius Mamilius, to help the Romans. Together with the forces of the consul Publius Valerius Poplicola they were able to quash the revolt. Poplicola was thankful to the Tusculans for their help, and conferred on Lucius Mamilius the honour of Roman citizenship. In 459 B.C. the Aequi attacked Tusculum and captured its citadel. Because of the assistance given Rome the previous year, the Romans came to their defense, and helped regain the citadel, with soldiers under the command of Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, who defeated the Aequi at the battle of Mount Algidus.

A Dioscuri figure is on the on left, Tusculum fortress being shown on right. =Roman Republic and Empire= The Tusculum portrait of Julius Caesar from 50‚Äì40 BC, found in the city in 1825 In 381 BC, after an expression of complete submission to Rome, the people of Tusculum received a franchise from Rome. Tusculum became the first \\"municipium cum suffragio\\", or self-governing city. The Tusculum citizens were therefore recorded in the \\"Tribus Papiria\\". Other accounts, however, speak of Tusculum as often allied with Rome's enemies, the last being the Samnites in 323 BC. In 54 BC, in his Orationes Pro Cn. Plancio, Marcus Tullius Cicero said: \\"You are from the most ancient municipium of Tusculum, from which so many consular families are originating, among which even the gens Iuventia‚Äîall other municipia (together) do not have so many (consular families) coming from them\\". Varro wrote about the laws of Tusculum in De Lingua Latina, Volume 5: \\"New wine shall not be taken into the town before the Vinalia are proclaimed\\". The town council kept the name of senate, but the title of dictator gave place to that of aedile. Notwithstanding this, and the fact that a special college of Roman equites was formed to take charge of the cults of the gods at Tusculum, and especially of the Dioscuri, the citizens resident there were neither numerous nor men of distinction. The villas of the neighbourhood had indeed acquired greater importance than the town itself, which was not easily accessible. By the end of the Republic, and still more during the imperial period, the territory of Tusculum was a favorite place of residence for wealthy Romans. Seneca wrote: \\"Nobody who wants to acquire a home in Tusculum or Tibur for health reasons or as a summer residence, will calculate how much yearly payments are\\". In 45 BC Cicero wrote a series of books in his Roman villa in Tusculum, the Tusculanae Quaestiones. In his times there were eighteen owners of villas there. An example is the so- called villa of Lucullus, which later belonged to Flavia gens, which was built in terraces on the slope of Tusculum facing Rome: the vast terrace now houses virtually all the historical centre of Frascati.Giuseppe Lugli, La villa di Domiziano sui Colli Albani: parte I, p 30 Much of the territory (including Cicero's villa), but not the town itself, which lies far too high, was supplied with water by the Aqua Crabra. The last archeological evidence of Roman Tusculum is a bronze tablet of 406 AD commemorating Anicius Probus Consul and his sister Anicia.

In the 10th century it was the base of the Counts of Tusculum, an important family in the Medieval History of Rome. They were a clan system whose first mentioned member is Theophylact I (died 924). His daughter Marozia married Alberic I, Marquis of Spoleto and Camerino, and was for a while the arbiter of political and religious affairs in Rome‚Äîa position which the Counts held for a long period of time. They were pro-Byzantine and against the German Emperors. From their clan came several Popes in the period between 914 and 1049. Gregory I of Tusculum rebuilt the fortress on the Tuscolo hill, and gave as a gift the \\"Criptaferrata\\" to Saint Nilus the Younger, where the latter built a famous abbey. Gregory also headed the rebellion of the Roman people of 1001 against the German Emperor Otto III. After 1049 the Counts of Tusculum Papacy declined as the particular \\"formula\\" of the papacy-family became outdated. Subsequent events from 1062 confirmed the change of the Counts' politics, which became pro-Emperor in opposition to the Commune of Rome. Tusculum had in this time several notable guests: Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor, and his wife Empress Agnes in 1046, the Pope Eugene III from 1149, Louis VII of France and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1149, Frederick Barbarossa and the English Pope Adrian IV in 1155. In 1167 the Roman communal army attacked Tusculum (Battle of Monte Porzio), but it was defeated by the Emperor-allied army, headed by Christian I, Archbishop of Mainz; in the summer of the same year, however, a plague decimated the imperial army and Frederick Barbarossa was forced to get back to Germany. =Destruction and rediscovery= A different view of the theatre From 1167 the residents of Tusculum moved to the neighbours (Locus) or little villages as Monte Porzio Catone, Grottaferrata and mostly to Frascati: only a little group of defence troops remained in the old city. When in 1183 the Roman army again attacked Tusculum, Barbarossa sent a new contingent of troops to its defence. The Commune of Rome was however able to destroy the town on 17 April 1191 with the consent of Pope Celestine III and the consent of Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor, son of Frederick Barbarossa. Roger of Hoveden wrote \\"lapis supra lapidem non remansit\\" (not a stone upon a stone remained), indeed the Roman Commune's army took away the stones of the walls of Tusculum as spoils of war in Rome. After destruction the land of Tusculum city became woodland and pasture lands. The buildings destroyed in Tusculum became a big open quarry of materials for the inhabitants of the neighbouring towns of the Alban Hills. In 1806 the first campaign of archaeological excavation on the top of the Tuscolo hill was begun by Lucien Bonaparte. In 1825 the archaeologist Luigi Biondi excavated to find out Tusculum, engaged by Queen Maria Cristina of Bourbon, wife of Charles Felix of Sardinia. In 1839 and 1840 the architect and archaeologist Luigi Canina, called by the same royal family, excavated the Theatre area of Tusculum. The ancient works of art excavated were sent to Savoy Castle of Agli√® in Piedmont. In 1825 Lucien Bonaparte found the so-called Tusculum portrait of Julius Caesar at the city's forum. In 1890 Thomas Ashby arrived to Rome as Director of the British School in Rome. He was an expert of ancient monuments topography and studied the Tusculum monuments, reporting the results in The Roman Campagna in Classical Times published in London in 1927. In 1955 and 1956 the archaeologist Maurizio Borda excavated a necropolis with cinerary urns. From 1994 to 1999 was held the last excavation campaigns of archaeologist Xavier Dupr√© and his staff undertaken by Escuela Espanola de Historia y Arqueologia en Roma. Croce del Tuscolo. The marble slab. Main sights On the hill of Tuscolo are remains of a small theatre excavated in 1839. In the High Middle Ages, there were three churches in Tusculum: St. Saviour and Holy Trinity \\"in civitate\\", and St. Thomas on the acropolis. The Greek monastery of St. Agata lay at the foot of the Tuscolo hill, at the 15th mile of the Via Latina road, the old \\"Statio Roboraria\\" : it was founded in 370 AD by the basilian monk John of Cappadocia, a disciple of St. Basil of Caesarea, called St. Basil the Great. He brought here a relic of the master, handed it over to him by monk Gregory Nazianzus. Saint Nilus the Younger died in this Greek monastery on 27 December 1005. The Portrait of \\"Madonna del Tuscolo\\", placed nowadays in a little aedicule on the Tuscolo hill, is a reproduction in ceramic of an earlier original icon from Tusculum, spoil of war, which now is in the Abbey of St. Mary in Grottaferrata. In the extra- urban area located south of the city, between it and the Via Latina, there is archeological evidence of burials in the place of a medieval church already in ruin after 1191 and dating to the 13th century, found by the last archeological excavation (1999). The cross of Tusculum there was already in 1840, as reported by Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman, rector of the English College. In October, 1864 the students of the English College rebuilt the plinth of foundation of the old cross. Now on the top of the Tuscolo hill is an altar and an iron cross 19 metres (62,33 ft) high. The height of cross underlines the fact that it was built 19 centuries after the death of Jesus Christ.  References   Sources  *Richard Stillwell, ed.

The English translation of Fictions was published in 1962, the same year as Labyrinths, a separate compilation of Borges's translated works. The two volumes lifted Borges to worldwide literary fame in the 1960s and several stories feature in both. \\"The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim\\" originally appeared published in History of Eternity (1936). Background =Publication= In 1941, Borges's second collection of fiction, The Garden of Forking Paths (El Jard√≠n de senderos que se bifurcan) was published. It contained eight stories. In 1944, a new section labeled Artifices, containing six stories, was added to the eight of The Garden of Forking Paths. These were given the collective title Ficciones. Borges added three more stories to the Artifices section in the 1956 edition. =Translation= In 1948, the story \\"The Garden of Forking Paths\\" was translated into English by Anthony Boucher and published in Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine. In 1962, an English translation of Ficciones was published by Grove Press. Edited and introduced by Anthony Kerrigan, the other translators were Anthony Bonner, Alastair Reid, Helen Temple, and Ruthven Todd. Contents * Part One: The Garden of Forking Paths ** Prologue ** Tl√∂n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius (1940) ** The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim (1936, not included in the 1941 edition) ** Pierre Menard, Author of the Quixote (1939) ** The Circular Ruins (1940) ** The Lottery in Babylon (1941) ** An Examination of the Work of Herbert Quain (1941) ** The Library of Babel (1941) ** The Garden of Forking Paths (1941) * Part Two: Artifices ** Prologue ** Funes the Memorious (1942) ** The Form of the Sword (1942) ** Theme of the Traitor and the Hero (1944) ** Death and the Compass (1942) ** The Secret Miracle (1943) ** Three Versions of Judas (1944) ** The End (1953, 2nd edition only) ** The Sect of the Phoenix (1952, 2nd edition only) ** The South (1953, 2nd edition only) Style Ficciones emphasizes and calls attention to its fictional nature. The choice and use of literary devices are conspicuous in the stories. Naomi Lindstrom explains that Borges saw an effort to make a story appear natural \\"as an impoverishment of fiction's possibilities and falsification of its artistic character.\\" Themes The labyrinth is a recurring motif throughout the stories. It is used as a metaphor to represent a variety of things: the overwhelmingly complex nature of worlds and the systems that exist on them, human enterprises, the physical and mental aspects of humans, and abstract concepts such as time. The stories of Borges can be seen as a type of labyrinth themselves. Borges often gives his first-person narrators the name \\"Borges.\\" While he imparts many of his own characteristics in them, he does not idealize them, and gives them human failings as well. English phrases appear intermittently in his Spanish stories. Occasionally, the title is in English. Borges often puts his protagonists in red enclosures. This has led to analysis of his stories from a Freudian viewpoint, although Borges himself strongly disliked his work being interpreted in such a way. In fact, he called psychoanalysis (Obra po√©tica, Pr√≥logo) \\"la triste mitolog√≠a de nuestro tiempo\\", or \\"the sad mythology of our time\\". Borges loved books and gives detailed descriptions of the characteristics of the fictional texts in his stories. In The Approach to Al-Mu'tasim, he indirectly suggests that a librarian is even holier than a saint. Other themes throughout his stories include: philosophical issues; deterioration and ruination; games of strategy and chance; conspiracies and secret societies; and ethnic groups, especially those in his own ancestry. Reception Ficciones is one of Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century. According to the Norwegian writer Karl Ove Knausgaard, the first story in Ficciones, Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius, is \\"the best short story ever written.\\"https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/tyler-cowen- karl-ove-knausgaard-writing-cc34a354fed7 See also References External links *Bibliography maintained at University of Pittsburgh *Ficciones by Jorge Luis Borges, reviewed by Ted Gioia (Postmodern Mystery) Category:1944 short story collections Category:Fantasy short story collections Category:Short story collections by Jorge Luis Borges ","title":"Ficciones"},{"id":"1138374","text":"The Second Battle of Fallujah‚Äîcode-named Operation Al-Fajr (Arabic: ÿßŸÑŸÅÿ¨ÿ± \\"the dawn\\") and Operation Phantom Fury‚Äîwas a joint American, Iraqi government, and British offensive in November and December 2004, considered the highest point of conflict in Fallujah during the Iraq War. It was led by the U.S. Army and U.S. Marines against the Iraqi insurgents in the city of Fallujah and was authorized by the U.S.-appointed Iraqi Interim Government. The U.S. military called it \\"some of the heaviest urban combat U.S. Marines and Soldiers have been involved in since the Battle of Hu·∫ø City in Vietnam in 1968.\\"ScanEagle Proves Worth in Fallujah Fight, DefenseLINK NewsRicks, Thomas E. (2007). Fiasco: The American Military Adventure in Iraq, 2003‚Äì2005. Penguin. p. 399. . This operation was the second major operation in Fallujah. Earlier, in April 2004, coalition forces fought the First Battle of Fallujah in order to capture or kill insurgent elements considered responsible for the deaths of a Blackwater Security team. When coalition forces fought into the center of the city, the Iraqi government requested that the city's control be transferred to an Iraqi-run local security force, which then began stockpiling weapons and building complex defenses across the city through mid-2004.Ricks, (2007) pp. 343‚Äì346. The second battle was the bloodiest battle of the entire Iraq War for American troops, and is notable for being the first major engagement of the Iraq War fought solely against insurgents rather than the forces of the former Ba'athist Iraqi government, which was deposed in 2003. Background In February 2004, control of Fallujah and the surrounding area in the Al Anbar Governorate was transferred from the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division to the 1st Marine Division. Shortly afterward, on 31 March 2004, four American private military contractors from Blackwater‚ÄîWesley Batalona, Scott Helvenston, Jerry Zovko and Michael Teague‚Äîwere ambushed and killed in the city. Images of their mutilated bodies were broadcast around the world. Journalist Jeremy Scahill later called this incident the Mogadishu moment of the Iraq War. Although tactical commanders in Iraq considered these deaths militarily insignificant, U.S. political leaders disapproved of a measured approach targeting the perpetrators and instead requested a larger assault into the city. Within days, U.S. Marine Corps forces launched Operation Vigilant Resolve (4 April 2004) to take back control of the city from insurgent forces. On 28 April 2004, Operation Vigilant Resolve ended with an agreement where the local population was ordered to keep the insurgents out of the city. The Fallujah Brigade, composed of local Iraqis under the command of a former Ba'athist officer named Muhammed Latif, took control of the city. Insurgent strength and control began to grow to such an extent that by 24 September 2004, a senior U.S. official told ABC News that catching Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, said to be in Fallujah, was now \\"the highest priority,\\" and estimated his troops at 5,000 men, mostly non-Iraqis. However, the stated purpose of the military operation in Fallujah was to weaken the insurgency in preparation for the planned Iraqi elections in January 2005. Preparations =Coalition forces= Before beginning their attack, U.S. and Iraqi forces had established checkpoints around the city to prevent anyone from entering, and to intercept insurgents attempting to flee. In addition, overhead imagery was used to prepare maps of the city for use by the attackers. American units were augmented by Iraqi interpreters to assist them in the planned fight. After weeks of withstanding air strikes and artillery bombardment, the militants in the city appeared to be vulnerable to direct attack. U.S., Iraqi and British forces totaled about 13,500. The U.S. had gathered some 6,500 Marines and 1,500 Army soldiers that would take part in the assault with about 2,500 Navy personnel in operational and support roles. U.S. troops were grouped in two Regimental Combat Teams: Regimental Combat Team 1 comprised 3rd Battalion/1st Marines, 3rd Battalion/5th Marines, Naval Mobile Construction Battalions 4 and 23 (\\"Seabees\\") and the U.S. Army's 2d Battalion/7th Cavalry. Regimental Combat Team 7 comprised the 1st Battalion/8th Marines, 1st Battalion/3d Marines, 1st Battalion/12th Marines Charlie Battery's artillery, the U.S. Army's 2d Battalion/2d Infantry, 2d Battalion/12th Cavalry, and 1st Battalion/6th Field Artillery.Lowry, Richard S. (2010). New Dawn: The Battles for Fallujah. Savas Beatie. pp. 269‚Äì279. . About 2,000 Iraqi troops assisted with the assault. All were supported by 3d Marine Aircraft Wing fixed- and rotary-winged aircraft, Navy, and Air Force fixed-wing aircraft; and U.S. Army field artillery battalions, and USSOCOM Sniper Elements. The 850-strong 1st Battalion of the Black Watch was ordered to help U.S. and Iraqi forces with the encirclement of Fallujah. As part of Task Force Black, D Squadron of the British SAS prepared to take part in the operation, but British political nervousness about the possible scale of casualties stopped any direct UK involvement in the ground battle.Urban, Mark, Task Force Black: The Explosive True Story of the Secret Special Forces War in Iraq , St. Martin's Griffin , 2012 ,p.65 =Insurgent forces= In April, Fallujah was defended by about 500 \\"hardcore\\" and 1,000+ \\"part time\\" insurgents. By November, it was estimated that the numbers had doubled. Another estimate put the number of insurgents at 3,000; however, a number of insurgent leaders escaped before the attack. Fallujah was occupied by virtually every insurgent group in Iraq: al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), Islamic Army of Iraq (IAI), Ansar al-Sunna, Army of Mohammed (AOM), the Army of the Mujahedeen and the Secret Islamic Army of Iraq. Three groups, (AQI, IAI and the National Islamic Army (1920 Revolution Brigade)) had their nationwide headquarters in Fallujah. An estimated 2,000 insurgents were from the Army of Mohammed (made up of ex Fedayeen Saddam fighters), Ansar al-Sunna and various smaller Iraqi groups.Nance, Malcolm W., The Terrorists of Iraq: Inside the Strategy and Tactics of the Iraq Insurgency 2003‚Äì2014, CRC Press, 2014 The Iraqi insurgents and foreign mujahadeen present in the city prepared fortified defenses in advance of the anticipated attack.Lowry, Richard S. (2010). New Dawn: The Battles for Fallujah. Savas Beatie. p. 20. . They dug tunnels, trenches, prepared spider holes, and built and hid a wide variety of IEDs. In some locations they filled the interiors of darkened homes with large numbers of propane bottles, large drums of gasoline, and ordnance, all wired to a remote trigger that could be set off by an insurgent when troops entered the building. They blocked streets with Jersey barriers and even emplaced them within homes to create strong points behind which they could attack unsuspecting troops entering the building. Insurgents were equipped with a variety of advanced small arms, and had captured a variety of U.S. armament, including M14s, M16s, body armor, uniforms and helmets. They booby-trapped buildings and vehicles, including wiring doors and windows to grenades and other ordnance. Anticipating U.S. tactics to seize the roof of high buildings, they bricked up stairwells to the roofs of many buildings, creating paths into prepared fields of fire which they hoped the troops would enter. Intelligence briefings given prior to battle reported that coalition forces would encounter Chechen, Filipino, Saudi, Libyan, and Syrian combatants, as well as native Iraqis.Bellavia, David & Bruning, John. House to House: An Epic Memoir of War Free Press. (2007) . =Civilian presence= Meanwhile, most of Fallujah's civilian population fled the city, which greatly reduced the potential for noncombatant casualties. U.S. military officials estimated that 70‚Äì90% of the 300,000 civilians in the city fled before the attack. The battle =Diversion= US Army Infantryman from TF 2‚Äì7 CAV, prepare to enter a building during fighting in Fallujah.

The same unit, operating under the command of the U.S. Army III Corps, then moved to the western approaches to the city and secured the Jurf Kas Sukr Bridge. These initial attacks, however, were a diversion intended to distract and confuse insurgents holding the city, preceding the all-out offensive. =Attack= An M1 Abrams fires its main gun into a building to provide suppressive counterfire against insurgents.

After Navy Seabees from I MEF Engineer Group (MEG) interrupted and disabled electrical power at two substations located just northeast and northwest of the city, two Marine Regimental Combat Teams, Regimental Combat Team 1 (RCT-1) and Regimental Combat Team 7 (RCT-7) launched an attack along the northern edge of the city. They were joined by two U.S. Army heavy battalion-sized units, the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, and Task Force 2nd Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment (Mechanized). These two battalions were followed by four infantry battalions who were tasked with clearing the remaining buildings. The Army's mechanized Second Brigade, First Cavalry Division, augmented by the Marines' Second Reconnaissance Battalion and A. Co 1st Battalion, 5th Infantry Regiment, was tasked to infiltrate the city and destroy any fleeing enemy forces. The British Army's 1st Battalion, The Black Watch, patrolled the main highways to the east. The RCTs were augmented by three 7-man SEAL Sniper Teams from Naval Special Warfare Task Group-Central and one platoon from 1st Recon, who provided advance reconnaissance in the city, Joint Terminal Aircraft Control (JTAC) and unilateral overwatch throughout the operation. The United States Air Force provided close air support for the ground offensive, employing F-15 Strike Eagles, F-16 Fighting Falcons, A-10 Thunderbolt IIs, B-52 Stratofortresses, and AC-130 gunships to carry out close-quarter precision airstrikes against enemy strongholds within the city. The Air Force also employed MQ-1 Predator unmanned aerial vehicles for reconnaissance and precision strikes, and the U-2 Dragon Lady high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft for intelligence collection, surveillance and reconnaissance before, during, and after the battle. The six battalions of Army, Marine and Iraqi forces, aided by Mike Battery Marine Corps Scout and Target Acquisition and SEAL Sniper and JTAC elements pre-fire operations, moved into the city under the cover of darkness; and once aligned with the reconnaissance elements, began the assault in the early hours of 8 November 2004, preceded by an intense artillery barrage firing some 2500 155mm projectiles and air attack. This was followed by an attack on the main train station, which was then used as a staging point for follow-on forces. By that afternoon, under the protection of intense air cover, Marines entered the Hay Naib al-Dubat and al-Naziza districts. The Marines were followed by the Navy Seabees of NMCB 4 and NMCB 23 who bulldozed the streets clear of debris from the bombardment that morning. The Seabees used armored bulldozers to plow the streets while remaining safe and protected from enemy fire. Shortly after nightfall on 9 November 2004, Marines had reportedly reached Phase Line Fran at Highway 10 in the center of the city. An air strike is called in on a suspected insurgent hideout in Fallujah. While most of the fighting subsided by 13 November 2004, U.S. Marines and Special Operations Forces continued to face determined isolated resistance from insurgents hidden throughout the city. By 16 November 2004, after nine days of fighting, the Marine command described the action as mopping up pockets of resistance. Sporadic fighting continued until 23 December 2004. By late January 2005, news reports indicated U.S. combat units were leaving the area, and were assisting the local population in returning to the now heavily damaged city. =Recognition= The U.S. Army Task Force 2nd Battalion, 2nd Infantry Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, U.S. Army Task Force 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, and Naval Special Warfare Task Group-Central were awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for actions during the battle. Staff Sergeant David Bellavia of the Army's Task Force 2-2 Infantry was awarded the Medal of Honor. Sergeant Rafael Peralta of 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines, was awarded the Navy Cross. Three other Marines were awarded the Navy Cross: First Sergeant Bradley Kasal of 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines, Staff Sergeant Aubrey McDade of Bravo Co, 1st Battalion 8th Marines, and Corporal Dominic Esquibel of H&S; Company, Scout Sniper Platoon, 1st Battalion 8th Marines. Corporal Esquibel refused the award, citing \\"personal reasons\\". Aftermath U.S. Army soldiers rush a wounded soldier to a waiting U.S. Marine CH-46E Sea Knight helicopter during the Second Battle of Fallujah in November 2004. The battle proved to be the bloodiest of the war and the bloodiest battle involving American troops since the Vietnam War. Comparisons with the Battle of Hue City and the Pacific campaign of World War II were made. Coalition forces suffered a total of 107 killed and 613 wounded during Operation Phantom Fury. U.S. forces had 54 killed and 425 wounded in the initial attack in November. By 23 December when the operation was officially concluded, the casualty number had risen to 95 killed and 560 wounded. British forces had 4 killed and 10 wounded in two separate attacks in the outskirts of Fallujah. Iraqi forces suffered 8 killed and 43 wounded. Estimates of insurgent casualties are complicated by a lack of official figures. Most estimates place the number of insurgents killed at around 1,200 to 1,500, with some estimations as high as over 2,000 killed. Coalition forces also captured approximately 1,500 insurgents during the operation. The Red Cross estimated directly following the battle that some 800 civilians had been killed during the offensive. The 1st Marine Division fired a total of 5,685 high-explosive 155mm artillery rounds during the battle. The 3rd Marine Air Wing (aviation assets only) expended 318 precision bombs, 391 rockets and missiles, and 93,000 machine gun and cannon rounds. Fallujah suffered extensive damage to residences, mosques, city services, and businesses. The city, once referred to as the \\"City of Mosques\\", had over 200 pre-battle mosques of which 60 or so were destroyed in the fighting. Many of these mosques had been used as arms caches and weapon strongpoints by Islamist forces. Of the roughly 50,000 buildings in Fallujah, between 7,000 and 10,000 were estimated to have been destroyed in the offensive and from half to two- thirds of the remaining buildings had notable damage. While pre-offensive inhabitant figures are unreliable, the nominal population was assumed to have been 200,000‚Äì350,000. One report states that both offensives, Operation Vigilant Resolve and Operation Phantom Fury, created 200,000 internally displaced persons who are still living elsewhere in Iraq. While damage to mosques was heavy, coalition forces reported that 66 out of the city's 133 mosques had been found to be holding significant amounts of insurgent weaponry. A city street in Fallujah heavily damaged by the fighting. In mid- December, residents were allowed to return after undergoing biometric identification, provided they wore their ID cards all the time. Reconstruction progressed slowly and mainly consisted of clearing rubble from heavily damaged areas and reestablishing basic utilities. Only 10% of the pre-offensive inhabitants had returned as of mid-January, and only 30% as of the end of March 2005. Nevertheless, the battle proved to be less than the decisive engagement that the U.S. military had hoped for. Some of the nonlocal insurgents, along with Zarqawi, were believed to have fled before the military assault, leaving mostly local militants behind. Subsequent U.S. military operations against insurgent positions were ineffective at drawing out insurgents into another open battle, and by September 2006, the situation had deteriorated to the point that the Al-Anbar province that contained Fallujah was reported to be in total insurgent control by the U.S. Marine Corps, with the exception of only pacified Fallujah, but now with an insurgent-plagued Ramadi..Situation Called Dire in West IraqU.S. lost control of al-Anbar province After the U.S. military operation of November 2004, the number of insurgent attacks gradually increased in and around the city, and although news reports were often few and far between, several reports of IED attacks on Iraqi troops were reported in the press. Most notable of these attacks was a suicide car bomb attack on 23 June 2005 on a convoy that killed 6 Marines. Thirteen other Marines were injured in the attack. However, fourteen months later insurgents were again able to operate in large numbers. A third push was mounted from September 2006 and lasted until mid-January 2007. Tactics developed in what has been called the \\"Third Battle of Fallujah,\\" when applied on a larger scale in Ramadi and the surrounding area, led to what became known as \\"the Great Sunni Awakening.\\" After four years of bitter fighting, Fallujah was turned over to the Iraqi Forces and the Iraqi Provincial Authority during the autumn of 2007. Al Qaeda-linked Sunni insurgents from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant subsequently took over Fallujah and parts of Ramadi in early 2014 and was reclaimed by the Iraqi Army and Special Operations Units in June 2016.\\"Top Iraqi commander vows to re-capture Fallujah and Ramadi after al-Qa'ida-linked fighters take control of key cities\\", The Independent, 5 January 2014 Order of battle =American forces= U.S. Marines take a break while searching the city of Fallujah in November 2004.

Despite the Coalition success, the battle was not without controversy. A number of allegations have been made regarding the United States' armed intervention. For example, a documentary entitled Fallujah, The Hidden Massacre stated that the U.S. forces used white phosphorus as a weapon against civilians. The U.S. military maintains that white phosphorus was not used against civilians, but has confirmed its use as an incendiary weapon against enemy combatants. According to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, white phosphorus is permitted under the Chemical Weapons Convention if it is used to illuminate a battlefield or to produce smoke. But white phosphorus is a banned chemical weapon if its toxic and caustic properties are used intentionally. An article by a US Army captain present at the battle published in the US Army's Field Artillery Manual makes it clear that white phosphorus was used against insurgents in situations where conventional munitions did not have the desired effects.OPCW agrees with U.S. Military that use of white phosphorus as an incendiary agent is not prohibited The use of phosphorus was especially controversial in the United Kingdom because British forces were involved in the battle. British law prohibits British forces being present in a theatre in which phosphorus is used as an anti-personnel weapon, whether or not the targets are military personnel. On 16 November 2004, NBC News aired footage that showed a U.S. Marine killing a wounded Iraqi fighter. In this video, the Marine was heard saying that the Iraqi was \\"playing possum\\". NCIS investigators later determined that the Marine was acting in self-defense. The AP news agency reported that military- age males attempting to flee the city were turned back by the U.S. military. Years after the battle, medical research teams discovered an increase in infant mortality, cancer, and congenital anomalies or birth defects among children born in Fallujah. It was later discovered that enriched Uranium exposure from munitions used in the war was either a primary cause or related to the cause of the birth defects and cancer.

She writes as J. D. Robb for the in Death series and has also written under the pseudonyms Jill March and for publications in the U.K. as Sarah Hardesty. Nora Roberts was the first author to be inducted into the Romance Writers of America Hall of Fame. As of 2011, her novels had spent a combined 861 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list, including 176 weeks in the number-one spot. Life and career =Personal life= Early years Roberts was born on October 10, 1950 in Silver Spring, Maryland, the youngest of five children. Both of her parents have Irish ancestors, and she has described herself as \\"an Irishwoman through and through\\".Irish Times May 12, 2007 Her family were avid readers, so books were always important in her life. Although she had always made up stories in her head, Roberts did not write as a child, other than essays for school. She does claim to have \\"told lies. Really good ones‚Äîsome of which my mother still believes.\\" She attended a Catholic school and credits the nuns with instilling in her a sense of discipline. During her second year in high school, Roberts transferred to a local public school, Montgomery Blair High School, where she met her first husband, Ronald Aufdem-Brinke. They married, against her parents' wishes, in 1968, as soon as she had graduated from high school. The newly married couple settled in Boonsboro, Maryland. Roberts' husband worked at his father's sheet-metal business before joining her parents in their lighting company. She gave birth to two sons, Dan and Jason. Roberts became a homemaker and would later refer to this time period as her \\"Earth Mother\\" years. Roberts spent much of her time doing crafts, including ceramics and sewing her children's clothes. Their marriage ended in divorceBellafante, Ginia, (August 23, 2006) A Romance Novelist's Heroines Prefer Love Over Money, New York Times, retrieved November 26, 2014. in 1983. Present Roberts met her second husband, Bruce Wilder, a carpenter, when she hired him to build bookshelves in July 1985. Her husband owns and operates a bookstore in Boonsboro, Maryland called Turn the Page Books. He also works as an adult content photographer and videographer. The Wilders also owned the nearby historic Boone Hotel, which was undergoing renovations when it was destroyed by a fire in February 2008. It opened as the Inn BoonsBoro in 2009; the suites were inspired by and named for literary romantic couples with happy endings. Roberts once stated: \\"You're going to be unemployed if you really think you just have to sit around and wait for the muse to land on your shoulder.\\" She concentrates on one novel at a time, writing eight hours a day, every day, even while on vacation. Rather than begin with an outline or plot summary, Roberts instead envisions a key incident, character, or setting. She then writes a short first draft that has the basic elements of a story. After finishing the first draft, Roberts goes back to the beginning of the novel. The second draft usually sees the addition of details, the \\"texture and color\\" of the work, as well as a more in-depth study of the characters. She then does a final pass to polish the novel before sending it to her agent, Amy Berkower. She often writes trilogies, finishing the three books in a row so that she can remain with the same characters. When possible, she does the same with the in Death books, writing three in a row before returning to contemporary romances. Her trilogies are all released in paperback, as Roberts believes the wait for hardcover editions is too long for the reader. Roberts does much of her research over the Internet, as she has an aversion to flying. She is an ardent baseball fan, having been honored by the local minor league baseball team Hagerstown Suns several times. =Writing career= Beginning She began to write during a blizzard in February 1979 while housebound with her two small boys. Roberts states that with three feet of snow, a dwindling supply of chocolate, and no morning kindergarten she had little else to do. While writing down her ideas for the first time, she fell in love with the writing process, and quickly produced six manuscripts. She submitted her manuscripts to Harlequin, the leading publisher of romance novels, but was repeatedly rejected. Roberts says, > I got the standard rejection for the first couple of tries, then my favorite > rejection of all time. I received my manuscript back with a nice little note > which said that my work showed promise, and the story had been very > entertaining and well done. But that they already had their American writer. > That would have been Janet Dailey.Regis, pages 183‚Äì184 Dailey would go on to be embroiled in a plagiarism scandal in which she eventually confessed to stealing some of Roberts' work. =Pseudonyms= Nora Roberts In 1980, a new publisher, Silhouette books, formed to take advantage of the pool of manuscripts from the many American writers that Harlequin had snubbed.Regis, p 159 Roberts found a home at Silhouette, where her first novel, Irish Thoroughbred, was published in 1981. She used the pseudonym Nora Roberts, a shortened form of her birth name Eleanor Marie Robertson because she assumed that all romance authors had pen names. Between 1982 and 1984, Roberts wrote 23 novels for Silhouette. They were published under various Silhouette imprints: Silhouette Sensation, Silhouette Special Edition and Silhouette Desire, as well as Silhouette Intrigue, and MIRA's reissue program. In 1985, Playing the Odds, the first novel in the MacGregor family series, was published. The book was an immediate bestseller. In 1987, she began writing single title books for Bantam. Five years later she moved to Putnam to write single title hardcovers as well as original paperbacks. She reached the hardcover bestseller lists with her fourth hardcover release, 1996's Montana Sky. Roberts has continued to release single-title novels in paperback. She still occasionally writes shorter category romances. Her attachment to the shorter category books stems from her years as a young mother of two boys without much time to read, as she \\"[remembers] exactly what it felt like to want to read and not have time to read 200,000 words.\\" Roberts and her career were featured in Pamela Regis' A Natural History of the Romance Novel. Regis calls Roberts \\"a master of the romance novel form, because she \\"has a keen ear for dialogue, constructs deft scenes, maintains a page-turning pace, and provides compelling characterization.\\" Publishers Weekly once talked about her \\"wry humor and the use of different narrators, two devices that were once rarities\\" in the romance novel genre. J. D. Robb Roberts had long wanted to write romantic suspense novels in the vein of Mary Stewart, but, at the urging of her agent, she concentrated on classic contemporary romance novels while she built a following of readers. After moving to Putnam in 1992, the publishing company quickly realized that they were unable to keep up with Roberts's prolific output. They suggested that she adopt a second pseudonym so that they would be able to publish more of her work each year. Her agent, Amy Berkover, convinced the publishers to allow Roberts to write romantic suspense novels under the new name. Her first romantic suspense novel was published in 1995 under the pseudonym J. D. Robb. The initials \\"J. D.\\" were taken from her sons, Jason and Dan, while \\"Robb\\" is a shortened form of Roberts. She first decided to use the pseudonym D. J. MacGregor, but right before publication, she discovered that this pseudonym was used by another author. As J. D. Robb, Roberts has published a series of futuristic science fiction police procedurals. These books, all part of the in Death series, feature NYPSD detective Eve Dallas and her husband Roarke and are set in a mid-21st century New York City. Despite the emphasis on solving a crime in each of the books, the overall theme of the series is the development of the relationship between Eve and Roarke. When the in Death series began, neither Roberts nor her publisher acknowledged that she was in fact the author. They hoped to allow the series to stand on its own merits and build its own following. After publishing 18 novels in the in Death series, Putnam published the nineteenth, Divided in Death, first in hardcover. The book became Roberts' first bestselling novel of 2004. As of March 2019, Roberts has published 48 novels plus ten novellas in the in Death series. Other pseudonyms Roberts wrote a story for a magazine titled \\"Melodies of Love\\" under the pseudonym Jill March. She has also been known as Sarah Hardesty. When the Born In series was released in Britain it carried that name instead of Nora Roberts. She has since changed publishers. =Success= In 1996, Roberts passed the hundred- novel mark with Montana Sky and, in 2012, doubled that with The Witness. In both 1999 and 2000, four of the five novels that USA Today listed as the best- selling romance novels of the year were written by Roberts. Her first appearance on The New York Times Bestseller List came in 1991, and between 1991 and 2001, she had 68 New York Times Bestsellers, counting hardbacks and paperbacks. The New York Times did not review any of those novels.Regis, p 184. In 2001, Roberts had 10 best-selling mass-market paperbacks, according to Publishers Weekly, not counting those books written under the J.D. Robb name. In September 2001, for the first time Roberts took the numbers 1 and 2 spots on the Publishers Weekly bestseller list, as her romance Time and Again was number one, and her J.D. Robb release Seduction in Death was number two. Since 1999, every one of Roberts's novels has been a New York Times bestseller, and 124 of her novels have ranked on the Times bestseller list, including 29 that debuted in the number-one spot. As of January 24, 2013, Roberts's novels had spent a combined 948 weeks on The New York Times Bestseller List, including 148 weeks in the number-one spot. As of January 9, 2009, 400 million copies of her books are in print, including 12 million copies sold in 2005 alone. Her novels have been published in 35 countries. A founding member of the Romance Writers of America (RWA), Roberts was the first inductee in the organization's Hall of Fame. In 1997 she was awarded the RWA Lifetime Achievement Award, which in 2008 was renamed the RWA Nora Roberts Lifetime Achievement Award. As of 2012, she has won an unprecedented 21 of the RWA's RITA Awards, the highest honor given in the romance genre. Two of Roberts' novels, Sanctuary and Magic Moments, had previously been made into TV movies. In 2007, Lifetime Television adapted four Nora Roberts novels into TV movies: Angels Fall starring Heather Locklear, Montana Sky starring Ashley Williams, Blue Smoke starring Alicia Witt, and Carolina Moon starring Claire Forlani. This was the first time that Lifetime had adapted multiple works by the same author. Four more films were released on four consecutive Saturdays in March and April 2009. The 2009 collection included Northern Lights starring LeAnn Rimes and Eddie Cibrian, Midnight Bayou starring Jerry O'Connell, High Noon starring Emilie de Ravin, and Tribute starring Brittany Murphy. TIME named Roberts one of their 100 Most Influential People in 2007, saying she \\"has inspected, dissected, deconstructed, explored, explained and extolled the passions of the human heart.\\" Roberts was one of only two authors on the list, the other being David Mitchell. =Victim of plagiarism= In 1997, another best-selling romance writer, Janet Dailey, admitted to repeatedly plagiarizing Roberts' work. The practice came to light after a reader read Roberts' Sweet Revenge and Dailey's Notorious back-to-back; she noticed several similarities and posted the comparable passages on the Internet. Calling the plagiarism \\"mind-boggling\\", Roberts sued Dailey. Dailey acknowledged the plagiarism and attributed it to a psychological disorder. She admitted that both Aspen Gold and Notorious lifted heavily from Roberts' work. Both of those novels were pulled from print after Dailey's admission. In April 1998, Dailey settled the case. Roberts donated the settlement to various literary causes including the Literacy Volunteers of America (now ProLiteracy). Roberts joined the chorus strongly criticizing fellow romance writer Cassie Edwards, who had lifted many passages from much older sources (many in the public domain) without giving credit, forcing Edwards out of the business. In 2019 Roberts, along with other authors, was a victim of plagiarism by Cristiane Serruya.http://time.com/5577788/nora- roberts-brazil-plagiarism- lawsuit/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/books/nora-roberts- plagiarism.htmlhttps://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/25/nora-roberts- files-multi-plagiarism-lawsuit-alleging-writer-copied-more-than-40-authors Charity Roberts has been included repeatedly on the Giving Back Fund's annual lists of the most philanthropic celebrities, with the bulk of her donations going to the Nora Roberts Foundation. The foundation financially supports organizations that promote literacy and the arts, assist children and engage in humanitarian efforts. The Foundation also endowed the Nora Roberts Center for American Romance at McDaniel College, which supports academic scholarship on the American romance novel, with special emphasis on the literary qualities and significance of the romance. Roberts has made other charitable efforts such as auctioning her jewelry. Works =Bibliography= Many of Roberts' novels have been, or will be, reissued. To avoid confusion, all of Roberts' new releases include a logo that is a circle with the initials \\"NR\\" inside, indicating that the book has never been published before.

The word bindu dates back to the hymn of creation known as Nasadiya Sukta in the Rigveda. Bindu is considered the point at which creation begins and may become unity. It is also described as \\"the sacred symbol of the cosmos in its unmanifested state\\".Khanna 1979: p. 171 Bindis are considered an immense part of Bangladeshi culture and women in Bangladesh irrespective of their religion, adorn themselves with bindis as an ethnic practice. A bindi is a bright dot of some colour applied in the centre of the forehead close to the eyebrows or in the middle of the forehead, worn in the Indian subcontinent (particularly amongst Hindus in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and Sri Lanka) and Southeast Asia among Balinese, Javanese, Malaysian, Singaporean, Vietnamese and Burmese Hindus. A similar marking is also worn by babies and children in China and, as in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, represents the opening of the third eye. Bindi in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism is associated with ajna chakra, and BinduMercier (2007). p. 267. is known as the third eye chakra. Bindu is the point or dot around which the mandala is created, representing the universe.Shakya, pp. 82‚Äì83 The bindi has a historical and cultural presence in the region of Greater India.Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East Timor, by Keat Gin Ooi p. 642Hindu-Buddhist Architecture in Southeast Asia by Daigor≈ç Chihara p. 226 Bindi or \\"Tip/Teep\\" is also worn widely by Bangladeshi women regardless of their religion as a tradition & cultural practice. Religious significance Traditionally, the area between the eyebrows (where the bindi is placed) is said to be the sixth chakra, ajna, the seat of \\"concealed wisdom\\". The bindi is said to retain energy and strengthen concentration. The bindi also represents the third eye. The Nasadiya Sukta of the Rig Veda, the earliest known Sanskrit text, mentions the word Bindu. The Ajna is symbolised by a sacred lotus with two petals, and corresponds to the colours violet, indigo or deep blue, though it is traditionally described as white. It is at this point that the two sides Nadi Ida (yoga) and Pingala are said to terminate and merge with the central channel Sushumna, signifying the end of duality, the characteristic of being dual (e.g. light and dark, or male and female). The seed syllable for this chakra is the syllable OM, and the presiding deity is Ardhanarishvara, who is a half male, half female Shiva/Shakti. The Shakti goddess of Ajna is called Hakini. In metaphysics, Bindu is considered the dot or point at which creation begins and may become unity. It is also described as \\"the sacred symbol of the cosmos in its unmanifested state\\". Bindu is the point around which the mandala is created, representing the universe. Ajna (along with Bindu), is known as the third eye chakra and is linked to the pineal gland which may inform a model of its envisioning. The pineal gland is a light sensitive gland that produces the hormone melatonin which regulates sleep and waking up, and is also postulated to be the production site of the psychedelic dimethyltryptamine, the only known hallucinogen endogenous to the human body. Ajna's key issues involve balancing the higher and lower selves and trusting inner guidance. Ajna's inner aspect relates to the access of intuition. Mentally, Ajna deals with visual consciousness. Emotionally, Ajna deals with clarity on an intuitive level. Goddess Tara depicted with Ajna Bhrumadhya Bindu known as inner gaze. Bhrumadhya is the point in the centre of the forehead commonly referred to as the third eye, or centre of consciousness. In Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, bindi is associated with Ajna Chakra and Bindu. Divinities in these religions are typically depicted with Bhrumadhya Bindu, in meditative pose with their eyes nearly closed show the gaze focused between eyebrows, other spot being the tip of the nose‚ÄîNaasikagra. The very spot between the eyebrows known as Bhrumadhya is where one focuses his/her sight, so that it helps concentration. In South Asia, bindi is worn by women of all religious dispositions and is not restricted to religion or region. However, the Islamic Research Foundation, located in India, says \\"wearing a bindi or mangalsutra is a sign of Hindu women. The traditional bindi still represents and preserves the symbolic significance that is integrated into Indian mythology in many parts of India.\\" Relief from stupa, 2nd century B.C. Only female figures were marked with the sacred lotus during this period. The red bindi has multiple meanings: * One simple interpretation is that it is a cosmetic mark used to enhance beauty. * Archaeology has yielded clay female figurines from the Indus Valley with red pigment on the forehead and hair parting. It is unclear whether this held any religious or cultural significance. * In Hinduism, the color red represents honor, love, and prosperity, hence it was worn to symbolise these aspects. * In meditation, the point between the eyebrows (Bhrumadhya) is where one focuses his/her sight, to help concentration. Most images of Hindu, Jain or Buddhist divinities in meditative poses with their eyes nearly closed show the gaze focused between the eyebrows (another spot being the tip of the nose‚Äînaasikagra). * Swami Muktananda writes that \\"auspicious Kumkum or sandalwood paste is applied (between the eyebrows) out of respect for the inner Guru. It is the Guru's seat. There is a chakra (centre of spiritual energy within the human body) here called Ajna (Aadnyaa) chakra, meaning 'Command centre'. Here is received the Guru's command to go higher in Sadhana (spiritual practice) to the 'Sahasraar' (seventh and final chakra) which leads to Self-realisation. The flame seen at the eyebrow is called 'Guru Jyoti'.\\"From Finite to Infinite, by Swami Muktananda, SYDA Foundation, S. Fallsburg, New York, 1989, pp. 88‚Äì89 * The encyclopaedic Dictionary of Yoga reports that this 'Ajna Chakra' is also called the 'Third eye'. This centre is connected with the sacred syllable 'Om' and presiding, is 'Parashiva'. On activating this centre, the aspirant overcomes 'Ahamkar' (the ego or sense of individuality), the last stop on the path of spirituality.Encyclopedic Dictionary of Yoga, by Georg Fuerstein, Paragon House Publishers, New York, 1990, p. 15 Traditional application method Bride with decorative bindis and maang tika between hair parting where married women apply sindoor. A traditional bindi is red or maroon in colour. A pinch of vermilion powder is applied with a ring-finger to make a dot. A small annular disc aids application for beginners. First, they apply a sticky wax paste through the empty centre of the disc. This is then covered with kumkum or vermilion and then the disc is removed to get a round bindi. Various materials such as lac, sandal, 'aguru', mica, 'kasturi', kumkum (made of red turmeric) and sindoor colour the dot. Saffron ground together with 'kusumba' flower can also work. Traditionally they are green in colour with a red dot in the middle. The bindi is no longer restricted in colour or shape.Khadi and Village Industries Commission, Government of IndiaParvesh Handa, \\"Home Beauty Clinic\\", Pustak Mahal, Ornamental bindis were made and sold by lac workers known as Lakhera. Historically, the ornamental bindi spangle consists of a small piece of lac over which is smeared vermilion, while above it a piece of mica or thin glass is fixed for ornament. Women wore large spangles set in gold with a border of jewels if they could afford it. The bindi was made and sold by lac workers known as Lakhera.https://www.gutenberg.org/files/20668/20668-h/20668-h.htm In Hinduism, it's part of the SuhƒÅg or lucky trousseau at marriages and is affixed to the girl's forehead on her wedding and thereafter always worn. Unmarried girls optionally wore small ornamental spangles on their foreheads. A widow was not allowed to wear bindi or any ornamentation associated with married women. In modern times, self-adhesive bindis are available in various materials, usually made of felt or thin metal and adhesive on the other side. These are simple to apply, disposable substitutes for older lac tikli bindis. Sticker bindis come in many colours, designs, materials, and sizes. Courtesan Bani Thani as Radha with ornamental bindi spangle, c. 1750 There are different regional variations of the bindi. In Maharashtra a large crescent moon shaped bindi is worn with a smaller black dot underneath or above, associated with Chandrabindu and Bindu chakra represented by crescent moon, they are commonly known as Chandrakor in this region, outside Maharashtra they are popularly known as Marathi bindi. In Bengal region a large round red bindi is worn, brides in this region are often decorated with Alpana design on forehead and cheeks, along with bindi. In southern India a smaller red bindi is worn with a white tilak at the bottom, another common type is a red tilak shaped bindi. In Rajasthan the bindi is often worn round, long tilak shaped bindi are also common, as well as the crescent moon on some occasions. Decorative bindis have become popular among women in South Asia, regardless of religious background. Bindis are a staple and symbolic for women in the Indian subcontinent.Priyabala Shah (April 1986) \\"Tilaka: Hindu marks on the forehead\\", p.88 In addition to the bindi, in India, a vermilion mark in the parting of the hair just above the forehead is worn by married women as commitment to long-life and well-being of their husbands. During all Hindu marriage ceremonies, the groom applies sindoor in the part in the bride's hair. Apart from their cosmetic use, bindis have found a modern medical application in India. Iodine patch bindis have often been used among women in north-west Maharashtra to battle iodine deficiency. =Related customs in other Asian regions= A Balinese dancer with a white bindi In Southeast Asia, bindis are worn by Balinese and Javanese Hindus of Indonesia. Historically, it was worn by many Indianized kingdoms in Southeast Asia. Bindis are also decorated on wedding brides and grooms of Java and other parts of Indonesia, even worn by non-Hindus. It is worn for cultural purposes because Indonesia was once ruled by Indianized Hindu kingdoms, thus the culture still preserves until today. Bindis in Indonesia are usually white, rather than red or black as in India. Modern use Hare Krishnas. Bindis are popular outside the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia as well. They are sometimes worn purely for decorative purpose or style statement without any religious or cultural affiliation.Khu ph·ªë Little India ·ªü Artesia, Nguoi Viet Online, 11 November 2011, Retrieved 22 November 2011 Decorative and ornamental bindis were introduced to other parts of the world by immigrants from the Indian subcontinent.Juventud organiza un mercadillo solidario a beneficio de la Fundaci√≥n Vicente Ferrer, elperiodic.com, 17 November 2011.

See . ‚Äî Cuetlaxtla near Orizaba, New Spain, 1650), who went by Alonso D√≠az and some other masculine names and is also known in Spanish as La Monja Alf√©rez (English, The Ensign Nun), was a one-time nun who subsequently travelled around the Basque Country, Spain and Spanish America, mostly under male identities, in the first half of the 17th century. Erauso's story has remained alive through historical studies, biographical stories, novels, movies and comics.  Early years  Erauso was born in the Basque town of San Sebasti√°n, Gipuzkoa, Spain, in either 1585 (according to some sources including a supposed autobiography of 1626) or February 10, 1592 (according to a baptismal certificate).Mar√≠a Claudia Andr√©, Eva Paulino Bueno, Latin American Women Writers: An Encyclopedia (2014, ).Jerome R. Adams, Notable Latin American Women: Twenty-nine Leaders (1995, ), ch. 5, pp. 45-46. Erauso's parents were Miguel de Erauso and Maria P√©rez de Arce Gallarraga, both of whom had been born and lived in San Sebasti√°n. Miguel was a captain and military commander of the Basque province under the orders of King Philip III of Spain. From an early age, Erauso trained with him and brothers in the arts of warfare.  Life at the convent  Around the year 1589, at age 4, Erauso (together with sisters Isabel and Maria) was taken to the Dominican convent of San Sebastian el Antiguo, where Erauso's mother's cousin, Ursula de Uriza e Sarasti, held the position of prioress. Erauso grew into a strong, stocky, and quick-tempered individual,Velasco (2000), p. 2. Realizing he had no religious vocation, and as a result feeling imprisoned and refusing to take his vows, Erauso was detained in his cell because of this and constant fights with a widowed novice named Catalina de Alirli. At 15, after being beaten by one of the older nuns, Erauso decided to escape. On March 18, 1600, the eve of San Jose, Erauso found the keys of the convent hanging in a corner, waited for the other nuns to be at morning prays, and escaped. Erauso spent a week fashioning boy's clothes, and headed for Vitoria, staying off the main roads. With short hair, Erauso easily passed as a boy there.  Travels around Spain  From this moment on, Erauso began the life of a fugitive, later narrated in the autobiography that gave him great fame. In Vitoria, Erauso met a doctor and professor, Francisco de Cerralta,In Vallbona's edition, the name is spelled Zeralta (Mendieta 2009, p. 86). who was married to Erauso's mother's cousin but took Erauso in without recognizing him.Eva Mendieta, In search of Catalina de Erauso (2009), p. 86.P√©rez-Villanueva, Life (2014), p. 78. Erauso stayed with him for three months, during which he learned some Latin, but when Cerralta became abusive, he left. Erauso took money from the doctor, met a mule driver and went to Valladolid with him. The court of King Philip III of Spain resided in Valladolid, under the influence of the Duke of Lerma.Ilenia Col√≥n Mendoza, The Cristos yacentes of Gregorio Fern√°ndez (2017, ), p. 3. Disguised as a man by the name of Francisco de Loyola,Luis de Castresana, Obras selectas de Luis de Castresana: Catalina de Erauso, la monja alf√©rez (1970), p. 68. Erauso served in the court for seven months as a page of the king's secretary, Juan de Idi√°quez, until one day Erauso's father came looking for Idi√°quez.P√©rez-Villanueva, Life (2014), p. 95. His father conversed with Idi√°quez, , all without recognizing that he had just spoken to that child. Afterwards, Erauso decided to head to Bilbao.Adams (1995), pp. 46-47. When he arrived, he was not as lucky as before, he did not find a place to sleep nor a patron. In addition, a group of boys made fun of and attacked him, and when he got into a rock fight and injured one of them, he was arrested and spent a month in jail.Mendieta (2009), p. 104. Once released from prison, Eraso went to Estella, and found work as a page there too, under an important lord of the town called Alonso de Arellano. Erauso was his servant for two years, always well treated and well dressed. Between 1602 and 1603, after his years of service to Arellano, he returned to San Sebasti√°n, his hometown, where he lived as a man, taking care of his relatives, whom he saw frequently. He also attended mass in his old convent with his former colleagues. It is said that he has also served his aunt without ever being recognized. After some time, he came to Puerto de Pasajes, where he met Captain Miguel de Berr√≥iz, who took her to Seville. They were there for only two days. He later returned to Sanlucar de Barrameda, where he found a job as a cabin boy on a ship. Captain Esteban Egui√±o, who was a cousin of his mother, owned the galleon. According to his memoirs, he embarked on Holy Monday, 1603 to America. Erauso felt like many Basques of his time inclined to venture to the Indies. He spent this time dressed as a man, with short hair, using different names such as Pedro de Orive, Francisco de Loyola, Alonso D√≠az [Ramirez] de Guzm√°n, and Antonio de Erauso. Apparently his physique was not feminine, which helped him pass as a man. Erauso once said he \\"dried [his] breasts\\" with a secret ointment.  Travels to the New World  The first place in the Americas where he landed was Punta de Araya, now part of Venezuela, where he had a confrontation with a Dutch pirate fleet which he defeated. From there they left for Cartagena and Nombre de Dios, where they stayed for nine days. Several sailors died there because of the weather. They boarded the silver and once ready to return to Spain, Erauso shot and killed his uncle and stole 500 pesos. He told to the sailors that his uncle had sent him on an errand. An hour later, the ship returned to Spain without him. From there he went with an usher to Panama, where he spent three months. In Panama he started working with Juan de Urquiza, merchant of Trujillo with whom he went to the port of Paita (now Peru), where the trader had a large shipment. In the port of Manta (now Ecuador), a strong wind destroyed the ship and he had to swim to save himself and his master. The rest of the crew perished. After a brief time in Paita, he went to Zana, a place full of cattle, grains, fruits and tobacco from Peru. There, his master happily accommodated him. He gave Erauso a home, clothing and a large amount of money, as well as three black slaves. In Sa√±a he had a fight with a young man who threatened him in a comedy theater. He ended up cutting off the face of the boy who challenged him. He was taken to jail again and through efforts of his master, Juan de Urquiza, and the bishop of that place, he was released on the condition that he married Do√±a Beatriz de C√°rdenas, lady of his master and aunt of the man who had his face cut. Not wanting to be discovered, he refused to marry. Then he went to the city of Trujillo, where his master opened a store. However, the man who was wounded in the face came to challenge him again accompanied by two friends. He went to the fight with another person, and in the fight the man's friend was killed. He was again imprisoned, and after his master saved him again, he gave him money and a letter of recommendation and sent him to Lima, which was the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru. He gave the letter of recommendation to Diego de Solarte, a very rich merchant and greater consul of Lima, and after a few days he was given his shop. He was responsible for the business for nine months, but was fired when discovered fondling a woman, the sister of his master's wife. After being dismissed, he found a company recruiting, whose aim was the conquest of Chile and, beset by the need to find a new occupation, he enlisted under the command of Captain Gonzalo Rodriguez. He was accompanied by 1600 men from Lima to the city of Concepci√≥n. From 1617-19 he worked as a llama-driver from Chuquisaca to the great mining center of Potos√≠, and was then recruited as a soldier.Lane, Kris. Potos√≠:The Silver City that Changed the World. Berkeley: University of California Press 2019, pp. 100-101.  Military exploits  After marching with his company to Chile in 1619, his army swept through the lands and property of the Mapuches, showing his aggressive side as conqueror, massacring many Indians. In Chile he was welcomed by the secretary of the governor, who was his brother, Don Miguel de Erauso, but did not recognize him. He remained there for three years and because of a dispute with his brother, (possibly because of another woman) was banished to Paicab√≠, the land of Indians. There he fought in the service of the crown in the Arauco War against the Mapuches in today's Chile, earning a reputation for being brave and skillful with weapons and without revealing that he was born a woman. In the battle of Valdivia he received the rank of second lieutenant. In the next battle of Puren his captain died and he took command, winning the battle. However, due to the many complaints that existed against him for his cruelty against the Indians, he was not promoted to the next military rank. This frustration led to a period devoted to vandalizing, killing as many people as he met on the road, causing extensive damage and burning entire crops. In Concepci√≥n he assassinated the chief auditor of the city, for which he was locked in a church for six months. After being released, he killed her brother Don Miguel de Erauso in another duel and was again imprisoned eight months. He later fled to today's Argentina across the Andes, through a difficult transition path. He was saved from the brink of death by a villager and taken to Tucum√°n, where he promised marriage to two young women, the daughter of an Indian widow (which had hosted Erauso on his farm during his convalescence) and the niece of a canon. He ended up fleeing from there without marrying any of them, but kept the money and clothing from Holland,(es) given by the niece of the canon as a sign of love. Then he went to Potos√≠, where he became the assistant to a sergeant, and returned again to fight against the Indians, participating in mass killings in Chuncos. In La Plata (Chuquisaca) he was accused of a crime he did not commit, he was tortured and finally set free again (without his birth sex being discovered). Once out of prison, he devoted himself to smuggle wheat and cattle on the orders of Juan Lopez de Arquijo. A new lawsuit forced him to take refuge in a church. In Piscobamba, by quarreling, he killed another individual. This time he was sentenced to death, but was saved at the last minute by the deposition of another prisoner sentenced to death. Then he remained in sanctuary for five months in a church due to a duel with a jealous husband. When he moved to La Paz, he was sentenced again to death for another offense. To escape, he pretended to confess and, after seizing a consecrated host fled to Cuzco and returned to Peru.  Return to Spain and audience with Pope Urban VIII  In 1623 he was arrested in Huamanga, Peru, because of a dispute. To prevent his execution he begged for mercy to Bishop Agust√≠n de Carvajal, and confessed that he was actually a woman who had been in a convent. Following a review by a group of matrons, they determined it was true that he was a woman and a virgin, the bishop protected him and he was sent to Spain. In 1625‚Äì1626, he petitioned the Spanish Crown for financial reward for his services as a soldier in the New World. He did this in his relaci√≥n de m√©ritos y servicios (Account of Merits and Services). In addition to seeking reward for his time at war, he also sought compensation for money he lost while spent traveling to Rome. This document includes accounts from \\"witnesses\\" or others who knew Erauso. However, many of the accounts are contradictory in nature and some do not know what to make of Erauso's predicament, for several reasons, most prominently that the witnesses all knew Erauso by different names and different accomplishments. They may have known Alonso D√≠az de Guzm√°n, the name Erauso used as a man, but they did not know Catalina de Erauso. Scholars are conflicted as to whether or not this visit between Erauso and Pope Urban VIII actually occurred, but his Account of Merits and Services can be found in the Archivo General de Indias and the Real Academia de la Historia of Madrid and was filed between 1625 and 1626, which would match up with the accounts of him being in Rome at that time.  Return to America and death  In 1630 Erauso settled in the New Spain, probably in the city of Orizaba, now in the state of Veracruz, and established a business as a muleteer between Mexico City and Veracruz. Locals state that he died carrying a load on a boat, though some argue his death occurred at the heights of Orizaba, alone; most plausible is that he died in the village of Cotaxtla. According to the historian Joaqu√≠n Arr√≥niz, his remains rest in the Church of the Royal Hospital of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception of the Juaninos Brothers, which today is popularly known as the Church of San Juan de Dios, in the city of Orizaba, Veracruz, Mexico. Although there is no solid evidence to support it, some postulate that Bishop Juan de Palafox tried to move his remains to the city of Puebla, home of the bishopric, but failed. Instead, according to other historians, the remains of Antonio de Erauso rest in the same place where it is believed he died, in the village of Cotaxtla. However, there is no documentation that can demonstrate the exact date and place of death.  Autobiography and controversy over its authorship  Antonio de Erauso wrote or dictated an autobiography which was first published in Paris in 1829, under his birth name Catalina de Erauso, at the request of Joaqu√≠n Mar√≠a Ferrer, a second time in Barcelona in 1838 and for the third time (1894) in Paris, with illustrations by Spanish artist Daniel Vierge. Then they were translated into several languages and versions of the theme, as idealized by Thomas De Quincey, entitled The Ensign Nun in English. In addition to these editions, a series of reprints of his autobiography after 1894, and about his return to Spain, a comedy was released by Juan P√©rez de Montalb√°n, Comedia famosa de la Monja Alferez (1625). Currently, it has generated a new debate among researchers of his life around the authorship of this autobiography, which some researchers have branded as apocryphal and without any basis for engaging in some chronological inaccuracies and contradictions.P√©rez-Villanueva, Life (2014). However, given the existence of baptism certificates and testimonies from others about his life and works, there is strong evidence for the historical existence of this person. Some have wanted to see a relationship between his extraordinary life, and the Baroque taste for portraying marginal and / or deformed or abnormal characters, as the main reason for the fame he gained throughout the Hispanic world on her return from America.  Questions of gender and sexual identity  Modern scholars have debated Erauso's sexual orientation and gender identity. In his memoir, Erauso never mentions being attracted to a man, but details numerous relationships with women. There was an encounter with the sister-in-law of a Lima merchant, a quarrel with Erauso's brother over his mistress and other occasions of Erauso being betrothed to women in the New World. Those betrothals, however, usually ended after Erauso exploited the situation and rode off with gifts and dowry money. Erauso also mentions an encounter when a hostess surprises him by \\"touching between her legs,\\" and also acknowledges having taken advantage twice of his 'disguise' as a man to get gifts from his future fianc√©e who did not know his sex. Other scholars, such as Sherry Velasco, have also written on the subject of gender and sexual identity.Velasco (2000). Velasco and others argue for viewing Erauso as transgender,Marcia Ochoa, Becoming a Man in Yndias, in Technofuturos: Critical Interventions in Latina/o Studies (2007), edited by Nancy Raquel Mirabal, Agust√≠n La√≥-Montes, p. 55.Leslie Feinberg, Transgender Warriors: Making History from Joan of Arc to Dennis Rodman (1996, ), p. 33. and Velasco also argues for viewing Erauso as lesbian, saying that, over the years since the first printings of Erauso's memoirs, there have been many different retellings and exaggerations in an effort to \\"de-lesbianize\\" Erauso through the invention of different heterosexual relationships as well as downplaying his relationships and behavior with other women. This happened mostly in versions of the story told and published in the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century, Velasco argues there was a \\"re-lesbianization\\" of Erauso, . Then, in the 1980s, he appeared as a \\"melancholy lesbian whose lover dies and a voyeuristic lesbian whose narrative ends with the optimistic image of the protagonist accompanied by the object of her sexual desire.\\" Matthew Goldmark, in turn, takes the approach of examining Erauso's Accounts of Merits and Services document, and in particular the \\"h√°bitos\\" or \\"habits\\" section of the document, with an eye to Erauso's sexual orientation and identity. This section gives accounts from witnesses or other people that knew Erauso and could speak to his demeanor in his petition of the King and the Pope. This section also was an intersection of not only gender, but also class and profession. The accounts in Erauso's document show how Erauso and others navigated ideas of gender and identity at that time. Regardless of how Erauso identified, researchers are still divided into different camps on the reason for Erauso's grand story of adventures. Some argue that Erauso had to pretend to be attracted to women in order to keep his identity a secret and to blend in with his fellow Spanish soldiers. Others argue that Erauso was actually a lesbian who used dress as a way to not attract attention from church authorities and to continue to be attracted to women. Still others fall into the third camp that Erauso actually did identify as a man. Those in this school of thought conclude from the evidence given, that Erauso was merely expressing his gender identity and was transgender. Regardless of those controversies, Antonio de Erauso chose to go back to the New World and continue his life as a man.  Legacy  Despite the existence of his own memoirs, probably written around 1626, Antonio de Erauso ended up disappearing from most known historical records, specifically in the period running between his return to Spain in 1624 and his return to the Indies, until the eighteenth century. At the end of the century, states Sonia P√©rez-Villanueva, one Domingo de Urbir√∫ had in his possession a manuscript copy of Erauso's memoirs, which was duplicated by a friend, the poet and playwright C√°ndido Maria Trigueros. One of the copies made by Trigueros ended up in the hands of the academic Juan Bautista Mu√±oz, who was writing the History of the New World and included a mention of Erauso in his work. Eventually, the copy was used as a reference by Mu√±oz finished in the hands of the Royal Academy of History in 1784, and later was rediscovered in the early nineteenth century by the politician Felipe Bauz√°, who persuaded his friend, the astronomer and merchant Joaqu√≠n Mar√≠a Ferrer for publishing. Finally, the manuscript was published in 1829 in Paris by Jules Didot with the title La historia de la Monja Alf√©rez, escrita por ella misma (\\"story of The Nun Lieutenant, written by herself\\"), and a few decades later was republished by Heredia in 1894, marking this version of his autobiography the revival of interest and research into his life. The character of The Nun Lieutenant was, and remains today, a source of inspiration for writers, playwrights, filmmakers and artists (most notably his 1630 portrait, attributed to Juan van der Hamen). In the nineteenth century, the work of Thomas De Quincey stands out, who turns Erauso into a typically romantic character, victim of fate and immersed in a series of adventures. Also in the nineteenth century is the novel by Eduardo Blasco Del claustro al campamento o la Monja Alf√©rez. And similarly it has been a source of inspiration for many analysis and academic papers trying to explain his complex personality. In the twentieth century the Monja Alf√©rez hit the screens and became more popular through several film versions, as in La Monja Alf√©rez, directed by Mexican Emilio G√≥mez Muriel (1947). At present, this character is attractive to the poststructuralist critique because he is a clear example of instability and relativity of the notion of gender in the construction of the identity of an individual.

The same basic product was built and/or sold under several other names, sometimes by other General Motors brands, in various markets around the world. While the first generation was of a rear- wheel drive design, later versions were all front-wheel-drive. The last two generations were no more than badge-engineered Honda Domani until the name was retired in 2000. __TOC__ First generation (1974) The first Gemini was the Bellett Gemini, first seen in November 1974. It was based on the third- generation Opel Kadett C on the General Motors T-car platform and came in four-door sedan and two-door coupe body styles. The chassis code was PF50, although the later 1.8-liter versions were called PF60 and the diesels PFD60. In June 1977 the Gemini received its first, light, facelift. The bigger 1817 cc G180 series engine became available, fitted with rectangular headlights rather than the round units used on the 1600. This model offered , although this output dropped to if an automatic transmission was fitted. In November of the same year the 1600 was updated, now with square headlights and an engine with the I¬∑CAS oxidation catalyst (\\"Isuzu Clean Air System\\") which could manage the 1978 emissions standards. One year later the Gemini 1800's engine was also upgraded to meet the 1978 emissions standards. Power remained unchanged, and the automatic now offered the same power as cars with manual transmission.Automobile Guide Book 1979/1980, p. 168 The ignition system was now of a transistor less type, and the trunk lid was now opened remotely (not added to the Gemini 1600 until the end of December). The Gemini Black and 1800 Minx were also added, the Minx with a two-tone paintjob and the Black with black paintwork and more sporty yet comfortable equipment including alloy wheels. 1979 facelift Holden Gemini (Holden built and badged version for the Australian market) In June 1979, the Gemini received a new slant nose with rectangular headlights and a redesigned rear end. The changes were actually more comprehensive than that, also including a redesigned (longer) engine bay and a wider radiator opening for two new engines added in November (the twin cam G180W and the new 4FB1 diesel) which both required wider radiators for more air for cooling. In Japan, sports models were available originally with the \\"ZZ\\" name. Later, ZZ/L (1980), ZZ/R (1981), ZZ/T, and ZZ/E models were added. These were equipped with an Isuzu G180W 8-valve DOHC 1.8-liter engine, most commonly fuel-injected, producing at 6400 rpm. These models also came with a shortened remote throw manual shift lever and optional factory LSD differential. There was also a mildly sporting model of the OHC 1800, called the LS/G. In October 1982 a version of the diesel with Bosch VE electronic fuel injection was also added; this provided 8% more power than the regular version (66 versus 61 PS) and was fitted to the LT-E and LJ-E models. For those who wanted more, a turbo diesel appeared a month later. Also featuring electronic fuel injection, this model also received a standard rear anti-roll bar. Counterintuitively, the two more powerful diesels were never available with the coup√© bodywork. The Gemini was complemented in 1981 by the Giugiaro- designed coup√© Isuzu Piazza, based on the Gemini's platform, which was introduced in the United States in 1983 as the Isuzu Impulse and in Australia in 1986 as the Holden Piazza. After the front-wheel-drive second generation Gemini appeared in early 1985, the old rear-wheel drive version nonetheless continued to be built. The coup√© model was discontinued, and a slimmed down sedan range (including the ZZ and diesel models) continued to be available. This diminished range was produced until February 1987, when the rear-wheel drive Gemini was laid to rest after 768,537 had been built. =In other markets= 1976 Opel by Isuzu, a rebadging for the US ;North America The North American market version was originally sold as the \\"Opel by Isuzu\\" and then the Buick Opel (sometimes referred to as the \\"Buick Isuzu Opel\\"). It first appeared in late 1975, for the 1976 model year, and replaced the German-built Kadett which had become too expensive as a result of the weakening dollar and rising costs in Germany. Road & Track decried the switch, stating that the Isuzu felt \\"built to a price\\" and that unlike the real Opel, it was \\"one of our least favorite cars.\\" In 1978 a \\"Sports Coup√©\\" was added to the lineup, its changes being limited to the paint, different steel wheels, sporty mirrors, and a spoiler. For 1979 the car received a light cosmetic update with ribbed velour trim, a few new paint options, and rectangular headlights. For the 1981 model year, the \\"Buick Opel\\" metamorphosed into the \\"Isuzu I-Mark\\". The diesel engine was available in the I-Mark, but the standard engine was a (SAE net) version of the 1.8 litre G180Z engine. The diesel had a claimed (SAE net) at an unusually high 5000 rpm. The I-Mark was offered with four-door sedan or two-door coup√© bodywork with either engine, in Deluxe or fully equipped LS (added for the 1982 model year) trim. A five-speed manual or a three-speed automatic were on offer. There was also a base diesel-engined coup√© on offer, with a four-speed manual transmission only. The diesel gradually lost sales after USA's brief love affair with the diesel car came to an end in the early eighties, and eventually it was only available in a single coup√© version. For 1985, the rear-wheel-drive I-Mark's last year, only the Deluxe sedan version with a gasoline engine remained available. ;Australasia In addition to sedan and coup√© models, Holden in Australia produced the Gemini as a three-door station wagon and three-door panel van, which were derived from the Opel Kadett C Caravan and Vauxhall Chevette wagon, with Isuzu Gemini front panels. The panel van's side panels came from the Bedford Chevanne. The Australian Holden Gemini was fitted with an Isuzu G161Z petrol engine, although 1979 and later models were available with a 1.8-litre 8-valve SOHC diesel engine (4FB1). The more common G161Z was a 1.6-liter 8-valve SOHC fed by a Nikki carburettor. The Holden Gemini was Wheels magazine's Car of the Year for 1975. ;Other markets In Europe, the Gemini was equipped with the 1.6-liter engine which produced DIN there; the discrepancy in stated power (down 32 percent) may have been entirely due to the differences to the SAE (gross) measuring system used on Japanese market cars. Isuzu Gemini was also sold in South Korea as the Saehan Gemini, whose manufacturer became Daewoo Motors in 1982. It then became Daewoo Maepsy after 1982 and remained on sale (later as the Maepsy-Na after a facelift) until it was replaced by the Daewoo LeMans in 1986. It continued to be assembled as a taxi model called Maepsy Sigma until 1989.

As a considerable portion of the T-body manufacturing had been turned over to Isuzu in Japan for economic reasons, so would the manufacturing of the replacement. In 1984, Isuzu again commissioned Giorgetto Giugiaro who was responsible for the 117 Coup√© and the Piazza. This time, he was to design an economy car on the new front-wheel drive R-body platform. The R-body featured a MacPherson strut front suspension and beam axle rear suspension, which foreshadowed most of GM's offerings through their current model lineup. Giugiaro's design followed the Piazza design very closely in shape and detail, though the proportions made the Gemini appear shorter and taller in its three-door version, and a four-door sedan (notch back) was also designed. Unfortunately for everyone involved, Isuzu presented the designs to GM prior to freezing them, and GM ordered a number of detail changes to them without ever consulting the designer, Giugiaro, which was taken as an insult, and ended the long relationship between the noted Italian designer and Japan's second oldest car builder. The insult was serious enough to Giugiaro that he denied the design was his until a decade after the vehicle went out of production. The R-body Gemini was introduced in May 1985 as the Gemini FF (after it had already gone on sale as a Chevrolet in the United States), with an all-new line of engines. In Japan, originally with chassis code JT150, it was available with a carburetted 1.5-liter SOHC engine. An also newly developed 1.5-liter inline four diesel engine (JT600) was added to the lineup in November. At the other end of the lineup, a fuel-injected and turbocharged version of the 1.5-liter 4XB1 engine (\\"Irmscher\\") was added in May 1986. Originally, the transmission started out with a choice of a 5-speed manual or a 3-speed automatic, but NAVi5, an automated manual transmission, was added in 1986. The FF Gemini underwent a facelift in February 1987, receiving a more aggressive front styling with wraparound headlight as well as other minor changes. At the same time the \\"FF\\" moniker was dropped, as parallel production of the preceding RWD Gemini came to an end. In March 1987 the Gemini saw its European premier, at the Geneva Salon. European sales of the already somewhat dated Gemini were disappointing, and Isuzu soon withdrew from the European passenger car market entirely. A 1.6-liter DOHC engine with was introduced in February 1988. Export versions were also available with a smaller 1.3-liter four to suit taxation systems based on displacement. This offered , while export specification 1.5s had on tap and the naturally aspirated diesel offered outside Japan. Trim levels were widely varied, from basic models (\\"C/C\\" in Japan, \\"LT\\" in general export markets, and \\"S\\" in the US) to Irmscher, ZZ, and Lotus Tuned versions, and plenty of optional equipment and dealer options were available. =North America= In the US, the vehicle was available from Chevrolet (and later Geo) as the Spectrum, or from Isuzu themselves, as the I-Mark. GM's Pontiac division sold the I-Mark as the Pontiac Sunburst in Canada from 1985 to 1988. Sales were limited to coastal markets initially, as import quotas restricted the number of cars General Motors could sell in the United States. The Spectrum was presented at the end of November 1984, with cars already on sale in 16 eastern states. Isuzu's own I-Mark went on sale during the 1985 model year.Flammang, p. 309 Due to the quotas, only 29,500 cars were available the first model year, about a quarter of what GM had hoped to be able to sell. 1985 and 1986 models featured a unique eggcrate grille flanked by single square sealed-beam headlights. GM Canada announced that the Sunburst's replacement would be the Passport Optima in 1989. For GM, this was an entry level vehicle to attract young buyers and to compete with Japanese midsize cars in the US market. Chevrolet's Spectrum lacked many of the options and equipment of the I-Mark, although with the exception of a brief run of decontented hatchbacks in 1988 dubbed \\"Spectrum Express\\" they were not as austere as the base trim levels of contemporary Dodge Colt, Toyota Tercel and Honda Civics. Both were available with the 1.5-liter SOHC non-turbo and turbo engines, but neither diesel engines nor NAVi5 were offered in the US. The turbo model I-Mark was called the RS model in 1988 and then changed to the LS model in 1989. The I-Mark was available with the 1.6-liter DOHC engine in 1989 only, as the RS model. In 1988 and 1989, the LS and RS models were offered with Lotus Tuned Suspension, the sportier suspension featuring more rigid dampers, alternate spring rates, and bigger sway bars.

The last models were produced in 1993. The third generation sedan appeared in March 1990. Body size was wider than the previous generation. The Isuzu Gemini Coup√© was the basis for the Isuzu Impulse and Geo Storm in the United States and Canada, and for the As√ºna Sunfire which was sold in the Canadian market for the 1993 model year only. A 4-door sedan with similar mechanical components was sold as the Isuzu Stylus in the United States and Canada. The Geo versions lacked some of the more expensive and advanced features of the Isuzu (and As√ºna) versions. All these names were used on the last of the Geminis ‚Äî Isuzu Impulse, Isuzu Piazza, Isuzu Gemini MkII, Isuzu Stylus, and As√ºna Sunfire. The series name was called the type JT641S, the type JT641F, and the 4WD car is the same type JT191S. The car is 1700 cc turbo diesel type JT191F, 4WD gasoline turbo cars with 1600 cc DOHC gasoline type intercooler JT151F, the car is 1500 cc, and 1600 cc DOHC gasoline. The top-line Stylus RS model had either a 1.6 L naturally aspirated engine (1991) or the 1.8 L naturally aspirated engine (1992). The higher trim level packages offered \\"ZZ handling by Lotus\\" and \\"specification Irmscher\\" as the performance models in the lineup, but was carryovered from previous generations. The top model was the \\"Irmscher-R\\" JT191S type, equipped with a high-power turbocharged engine and full-time 4WD. The suspension packages that were installed on the second generation Isuzu Piazza were also shared on the Gemini sold in Japan, including the four-wheel steering setup. It was originally intended to be a four-door sedan, and coupe from September 1990, three-door hatchback has been added in March 1991 later. Sedan sales has been started from December 1990 under the name Isuzu Stylus in the North American market. As the recession began to take hold in Japan, known as the \\"bubble economy\\", Isuzu was affected particularly hard, and after a corporate restructuring, Isuzu decided to abandon passenger car production and focus on commercial truck and SUV production, as the Isuzu Trooper and the Isuzu Rodeo found many buyers internationally, with badge engineered versions sold in Europe as Vauxhall/Opel Frontera (Rodeo) and Vauxhall/Opel Monterey and Holden Frontera (Rodeo) and Holden Jackaroo/Monterey (Trooper) in Australia with assistance from General Motors, and Honda also selling the Rodeo as Honda Passport and the Trooper as Honda Horizon (in Japan) and the Acura SLX (in the United States).Organizational structure in the automobile industry revolution SFC Keio Keio University Shonan South Fujisawa Campus 1995 organizational behavior theory OB68 group REFERENCE FOUND ON JAPANESE WIKIPEDIA SITE #6 AND 7 The total production volume of vehicles was 406,625 units at the end of the third generation (from HQ Isuzu), with 17,754 units sold in the United States (from Ward's Automotive Yearbook). Fourth generation (1993) Isuzu Gemini rear Isuzu halted production of the Gemini and replaced it with a rebadged version of the Honda Domani. It was only available with the four-door sedan bodystyle and a limited number of engines; the Domani also came as a five-door hatchback. Fifth generation (1997) Isuzu Gemini rear The fifth generation Gemini was a rebadged second generation Honda Domani sedan, a car which was also marketed as a Civic in Europe. Production of this model ceased in 2000. As usual, the Gemini was available in a much more limited lineup than that of the related Honda version, with only one bodystyle and either a 1.5 or a 1.6 litre engine. Safety In Australia, the 1982‚Äì1984 Holden Gemini was assessed in the Used Car Safety Ratings 2006 as providing \\"significantly worse than average\\" protection for its occupants in the event of a crash. Police use The Singapore Police Force previously used the Isuzu Gemini Fast Response Cars (FRCs) from 1991 until 1995 until they were phased out and replaced by the Subaru Impreza police cars. Related information The first and second generation Isuzu Geminis, specifically the diesel ones, were the most popular taxicab models in the Philippines in the 80s and early 90s. Models were phased out and gradually replaced with newer models from Toyota and Nissan. The front-wheel drive Geminis (second and third generation) were marketed in Japan with the catch phrase , and television commercials featuring exciting driving stunts throughout the streets of Paris. With French professional stunt driver R√®my Julienne mostly coordinating with all of the stunts, the Geminis enjoyed wide popularity.

It was based on the Japanese Isuzu Gemini, one of the many models based on the GM T-car platform.  First generation  = TX (1975‚Äì1977) = File:1977 Holden Gemini (TX) SL sedan (20774019312).jpgHolden Gemini SL sedan (TX) File:Holden TX Gemini SL Coupe.JPGHolden Gemini SL coupe (TX) The original Holden Gemini model, the TX series, was introduced in February 1975. It was available as a four-door sedan in S and SL specification levels, and as a two-door SL coupe. The TX Gemini was built at Holden's factory at Acacia Ridge, Queensland, and contained a high percentage of Australian content.Darwin, p. 344 All TX models share the same 1.6-litre SOHC Isuzu engine (coded the G161Z). The engine is chain-driven and incorporates a cross-flow design, alloy head. A two-barrel \\"Nikki\\" Stromberg carburettor was used on Australian models. Early TX models use a cast-iron, free-flow exhaust manifold, with two outlets into a \\"Y\\" pipe (this item is commonly used by modifiers for later models). From November 1976, this was changed to a single-outlet exhaust header. Wheel size is 13\\" x 4.5\\"; rear brakes are duo-servo units, similar in design to those used in the six-cylinder Torana. Early models use the MSE-type four-speed manual transmissions; reverse is positioned to the left and back. November 1975 had the introduction of the MSG-type four-speed; reverse on this transmission was to the right and back position. The TX SL sedan was voted Wheels Car of the Year for 1975, and was the most popular four-cylinder car on the Australian market. = TC (1977‚Äì1978) = 1977 Holden Gemini TC SL coupe The TC Gemini was sold between March 1977 and April 1978. This model received a minor facelift from the TX, appearance was enhanced by a bolder vertical front grille, and at the rear, a silver garnish panel (as opposed to the TX's black). A new Smiths-brand heater, defogger, and ventilation system was used, and the two small vents at each end of the dash were removed on this model, except on vehicles fitted with air conditioning. A \\"Fashion Pack\\" interior was now available on both sedan and coupe models; this option was also upgraded to add steel-belted radials and a front stabilising bar. Door side-impact beams were introduced to improve safety, and SL coupes had a heated rear windscreen. In April 1977, a limited-edition \\"Sandpiper\\" model was also offered in both sedan and coupe bodiess. They were identified by a black grille with stainless steel top edge, gold pin stripes, chequered cloth seat inserts and door trims, wood-grain dash sections, radio/cassette player, a four-spoke steering wheel, and the A9R (Fashion Pack) suspension package. Externally, they were easily identified by the word \\"Sandpiper\\" and a bird decal on the side rear quarters of the coupe and on the rear doors of the sedans. Gemini TC production totalled 17,257 units.G.M. Holden Gemini Production, www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au Retrieved 14 February 2019 = TD (1978‚Äì1979) = Holden Gemini (TD) wagon Holden Gemini (TD) wagon Gemini (TD) SLX sedan The TD series was introduced in April 1978, with the most major change over the TC being the introduction of \\"radial tuned suspension\\" and the option of a five-speed manual transmission. The differential was replaced with a small Salisbury unit as used in the UC Torana; it used tapered Timken wheel bearings as found on all larger Holdens since mid-1971. In April 1979, the rear brakes were changed to Commodore leading-trailing rear drum assemblies. Exterior appearance was changed with the introduction of a new grille, rectangular headlights (round on base models), wheels were now , and the rear number plate was relocated in place of the rear garnish panel. A panel van and three-door wagon were also added to the range, bodywork pressings being from the British Vauxhall Chevette/Bedford Chevanne range. Also new was the SL/E version, which used many interior options from the TC \\"Sandpiper\\" series, such as the radio/cassette, four-spoke steering wheel, timber dash inserts, velour seat trim, loop-pile carpet, and timber (hardboard) door-trim inserts. The SL/E also received the five-speed manual transmission as standard. Externally, appearance was further enhanced to include stainless steel headlight and grille surrounds, thick stainless steel door window-frame mouldings, and GM-H designed alloy wheels similar to Sunbird SL/E. Coupes and sedans had colour- coded side mirrors similar to those of Sunbird SL/E and HZ Sandman, door-trims were extended to cover the top of the doors. The SL/E was replaced by the SL/X in early 1979. It had a slightly lower equipment level, but a more competitive price. Also, a limited-edition \\"Gypsy\\" package was optional on panel vans, which included extra instrumentation and identifying decals. Heated rear windscreens were now standard on all but base model sedans, panel vans, and wagons. Nylon plaid cloth inserts were available on SLs and wagons, and air conditioning was available as an optional accessory. = TE (1979‚Äì1982) = Holden Gemini (TE) SL sedan The TE series Gemini was introduced in October 1979. It featured significant exterior changes with new front and rear styling, comparable with the Isuzu Gemini and Holden Commodore models of the same era. By this time, the Opel Kadett had been changed to front wheel drive and no longer resembled the original Kadett C. The TE was the most popular of all the Geminis, selling over 70,000 units. Initially only available as a sedan, in February 1980, the panel van and station wagon were added to the line-up, while the coup√© version was no longer available. The luxury SL/E version was also removed from the line-up, replaced instead with an SL/X variant. In 1981, the TE was introduced to New Zealand, replacing the British- sourced Vauxhall Chevette range. A limited-edition \\"Gypsy\\" van was made available in February 1980 and was offered with a tachometer and console gauges. Individual plaid cloth seats were available (a different plaid from other earlier Geminis). The Gypsy featured blacked-out grille treatment and door window surrounds, square headlights, full chrome bumpers, and full-length headlining and carpet (regular vans had vinyl flooring as standard). Gypsys are now a highly collectible Gemini model. Engine options originally stayed the same. In early 1981, the option of a 1.8-litre Isuzu diesel model was introduced, fitted with an M76 five-speed gearbox. This one was also a strong seller in Indonesia, where it was popular as a taxi. In Australia, all diesel Geminis were only available as SL/X five-speed manuals. Rhone green was a colour made available exclusively for the diesel, but other colours in the range could be ordered. Production of the diesel commenced in March 1981. = TF (1982‚Äì1983) = The facelifted TF series Gemini was released in March 1982. It was offered in four-door sedan, three-door wagon, and two-door van variants.Holden Gemini sales brochure, AD10065, March 1982 All models gained new grille treatments, and the SL/X variant received flush headlamps. The interior received major revisions with a new dashboard (creating the impression of more space in the vehicle) and a relocated steering column that put the steering wheel in line with the driver, rather than angled towards the centre of the car. The styling is often compared to the then-current VH Commodore range, but in fact the styling was introduced on the Isuzu Gemini in 1981 and carried across to the Australian model. = TG (1983‚Äì1985) = The TG series was released in March 1983. The SL and SL/X versions of TG had an appearance exactly like the TF SL/X, with the flush head lamps, plastic bumpers, and tail lights very similar to that on a VH Commodore. However, the base model of the TG continued the TF theme, with many examples now confused for TF models. Base-model vehicles had vinyl seats, no clock or cigarette lighter, and no console around the shifter. The engine continued to be the 1.6-liter as per previous versions, with the optional 1.8 diesel also available. Holden Gemini (TG) ZZ/Z sedan In 1983, a performance model, named the ZZ/Z (triple zed), was added. The ZZ/Z was always silver, with a body kit consisting of a front bar, wind splitters on top of the guards, a bobtail boot spoiler, alloy wheels, and blue and black ZZ/Z decals. The ZZ/Z was often thought to come with the twin-cam engine that was used in the Isuzu Gemini ZZ/R of the same era, but the ZZ/Z was strictly a cosmetic version and came with the standard running gear of other models. A five-speed manual gearbox was standard, with somewhat altered gearing; an automatic transmission was not available. The Gemini was built in Holden's Acacia Ridge plant, which closed in October 1984 after all Gemini production had come to a halt. However, wagon and panel-van production came to a gradual halt in mid-1984, as Vauxhall had ended production of the roof and the tailgate used on these models. Sourcing the parts from General Motors' Brazilian operation was considered, but was too complicated for the short time the model had left. Sales of the sedan continued into early 1985.  Second generation  = RB (1985‚Äì1986) = In May 1985, the RB series Gemini was released. Based on the front-wheel drive GM R platform, it did not sell as well as previous rear-wheel drive Geminis, with production totalling just 16,263 units. The RB Gemini was offered only in four-door sedan form, with SL/X and SL/E trim levels, as well as a fleet-only SL. Previous Gemini models had been built in the Holden facility at Acacia Ridge, but following that plant's closure in 1984, the totally new RB series began production in the Holden plant at Elizabeth, South Australia.Darwin, p. 349 The RB Gemini was discontinued in 1987The Red Book, August 1988, page 75 (production had ended sometime during 1986) due to poorer sales than its predecessor. The Gemini was at first sold side by side with the first generation hatch-only Holden Astra‚Äîa rebadged Nissan Pulsar (N12)‚Äîwhich was introduced in 1984; ultimately, the Astra effectively replaced the Gemini when its second generation, offered as both hatch and sedan, was launched in 1987. The RB Gemini was notable for its 80-day, endurance run from a commercial in 1985, tested by a group of Australian racers including the late Peter Brock. Holden Gemini (RB) SL/X sedan Motorsport From 1977 through to 1982 Geminis raced in the Australian Touring Car Championship and the Bathurst 1000 and allied endurance motor racing. Occasionally the factory Holden Dealer Team would divert some of their efforts away from their Holden Torana and Holden Commodore racing efforts to race a Gemini, notably in 1982, but for the most part Geminis were race by privately funded teams. Initially they fared poorly in a 2000cc class but a 1600cc class was re-created in 1978 increasing their popularity. Despite the transition from Group C regulations to Group A in 1985 a few cars continued racing until 1986. 1980 saw the creation of the Gemini Racing Series in Queensland which continues to this day and is now the longest running one-make series in Australia and the second oldest globally after the British Mini series.  Safety  In Australia, the 1982‚Äì1984 Holden Gemini was assessed in the \\"Used Car Safety Ratings\\" 2006 as providing \\"significantly worse than average\\" protection for its occupants in the event of a crash.

Buglass derives from the old lands of Booklawes near Melrose, Roxburghshire.http://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/BuglassBlack‚Äôs The Surnames of Scotland An earlier form of spelling is Buke-Lawes, i.e. buck or stag and low ground. Other theories include that the name originates from family/clan colour identification, specifically the Gaelic words Buidhe and Glas (yellow and green respectively) or it is of Norman descent. The first recorded instance of the name is from 1220, when a Robert de Bucles witnessed a confirmation charter in favour of the Abbey of Kelso. In 1423, John Bewclase (described as ‚Äúa trustworthy man‚Äù) witnessed the testament of Alexander Hume of Dunglass. The name is affiliated with the Home or Hume clan (see below). Other early recordings of the name, in various spellings, were: John Bukles, who witnessed an instrument of sasine in Lothian in 1535. Kathrine Bukles is recorded in 1589, whilst Agnes Buckles was noted to be living in the parish of Livingstone in 1675, and a John Bowglase signed a document in 1684 in Overlaskeoch. There are further variants of the name in the sixteenth century in Lothian: Buccles ( 1539); Bukeles (1571); Buikles (1584 and 1603); and Bugloss (1680) The Home clan, to which Buglass is affiliated, derives from Patrick, Earl of Dunbar, who lived early in the 13th century. Alexander Home was created a Baron in 1473, and the title was raised to an Earldom by James VI in 1605. Eventually, the family of Home of Coldingknow succeeded to the title, and from this, the 14th Earl is directly descended. For political reasons, he resigned his earldom to become Sir Alec Douglas-Home, later Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. In 1729, a Stephen Buglas [sic] was appointed vice tidesman at the port of Dumfries.http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=87300 Due to the geographical position of Roxburghshire, the Buglass name is also common in northern parts of England, such as Northumberland.

His book Magnum: Fifty Years at the Front Line of History: The Story of the Legendary Photo Agency (1999) on Magnum Photos, was described by John Simpson as \\"the best book on photo-journalism I have ever read\\". His oral histories of D-Day, Nothing Less Than Victory (1993), and the SOE, Behind The Lines (2002) were widely acclaimed, both in Britain and in the United States. Life and work Miller was born in east London and began his career in journalism at the age of sixteen. In the early 1980s, Miller decided to write a biographical trilogy on the subjects of sex, money, and religion. The books that followed were Bunny (on Hugh Hefner, published in 1984), The House of Getty (on J. Paul Getty, 1985), and Bare-faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard (on L. Ron Hubbard, 1987). =L. Ron Hubbard biography= In the 1980s Miller spent two years researching Bare-faced Messiah, a posthumous biography of the science-fiction author who had founded Scientology. The book challenges the official account of Hubbard's life and work promoted by the Church of Scientology and it was serialised in The Sunday Times. While researching the book in the United States, Miller was spied upon. His friends and business associates also received visits from Scientologists and private detectives. Attempts were made to frame him for the murder of a London private detective, the murder of American singer Dean Reed in East Berlin and a fire in an aircraft factory. Senior executives at publishers Michael Joseph, and at The Sunday Times, which serialised the book, received threatening phone calls and also a visit from private investigator Eugene Ingram, who worked for the Church. Another private investigator, Jarl Grieve Einar Cynewulf, told The Sunday Times journalists that he had been offered \\"large sums of money\\" to find a link between Miller and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

Introduction  Liberalism was organized in Brazil since 1831 in a traditional way as the opposition to conservatism. With the republican revolution of 1889 organized liberalism disappeared. Some liberal parties were founded in twentieth century. Since 1966 liberalism was best represented by the Democratic Movement. After multi- partyism became a fact, more parties labeled themselves as liberal, but the word was also used by moderate conservative forces. At the moment three parties name themselves liberal, but the Liberal Front Party (Partido da Frente Liberal) is a conservative party, member of the International Democrat Union.

It is also a former municipality within Nordland county. The village of Br√∏nn√∏ysund originally was declared a ladested in 1923 which made it an independent municipality. After merging with Br√∏nn√∏y in 1964, it lost its town status. Then in 2000, it once again received town status. The town lies along the coast and is often called \\"the coastal town in the middle of Norway.\\" Br√∏nn√∏ysund is also the regional center of Southern Helgeland. The town has a population (2018) of 5,045 and a population density of .  History  During the Viking era, Torgar, by the foot of the legendary mountain Torghatten, was a nationally powerful chieftain seat and an important commercial center along the coast. The original inhabitants were wiped out in an outright massacre by Duke Skule and his men in the Norwegian civil wars that raged around 1240, in the high medieval era of Norway. The region was re- populated by immigrants from Southern Norway, Tr√∏ndelag, and Sweden, which could explain the unique dialect with a Swedish-like intonation.

During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the town of Br√∏nn√∏ysund (population: 2,064) was merged with Velfjord Municipality (population: 1,380), S√∏mna Municipality (population: 2,347), Br√∏nn√∏y Municipality (population: 2,635), and the Lande-Tosen area of Bindal Municipality to form a new, enlarged Br√∏nn√∏y Municipality.

It was used by many noble families known as szlachta in Polish in medieval Poland and later under the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, branches of the original medieval Pi≈Çawa Clan (Pilawici) family as well as families connected with the Clan by adoption. History The progenitor of the Pi≈Çawa Clan was supposed to have been ≈ªyros≈Çaw z Potoka, who was fighting the Prussians, a pagan tribe and brought himself glory in the Battle of Pi≈Çawa, where he fought along Boles≈Çaw IV the Curly. The legend states that ≈ªyros≈Çaw reached the pagan chief, fought him in hand-to-hand combat and killed him. The terrified enemy hordes fled the battle field. The related legend tells also that in 1166, to commemorate the victory, Boles≈Çaw IV bestowed a coat of arms upon ≈ªyros≈Çaw, naming it for the place, where the battle took place. Blazon The Pi≈Çawa coat of arms assumed its final form in the late 14th century.

It continued Gram Parsons' and Chris Hillman's work in modern country music, fusing traditional sources like folk and country with other forms of popular music like gospel, soul, and psychedelic rock. The Gilded Palace of Sin is included in Robert Christgau's \\"Basic Record Library\\" of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). It is also listed at number 192 in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in the 2013 Edition and number 462 in the 2020 Edition.\\"500 Greatest Albums: The Gilded Palace of Sin\\", Rolling Stone Background After spearheading the Byrds foray into country music with the influential Sweetheart of the Rodeo album, Gram Parsons fell out with the band when he refused to accompany them on a tour of South Africa in 1968. Two months later bassist Chris Hillman left the Byrds as well and joined Parsons to form The Flying Burrito Brothers. As stated in the documentary Beyond Nashville, \\"Gram Parsons was passionate about country music's simple poetry. He was equally passionate about rock music. At a time when they were poles apart, he alone thought they belonged together.\\" Recording and composition The Gilded Palace of Sin was recorded at A&M; Studios in Hollywood and produced by Larry Marks with Henry Lewy engineering. The sessions featured a variety of drummers. In the Parsons biography Twenty Thousand Roads, A&R; man Michael Vosse recalls to David M. Meyer, \\"Larry Marks was a staff producer at A&M.; He was a good guy, but he wasn't a good match for them. He was completely flummoxed by their behavior. They were less prepared and less conscious of money and time than he was used to. There was a lot of wasted time and a lot of crap. There were also a lot of good sessions.\\" With harmonies that reveal the influences of the Everly Brothers and the Louvin Brothers, the songs on the Burritos' debut attempt to marry country music with the soul sound associated with Otis Redding's Stax-Volt label and singers like Percy Sledge. Another significant characteristic of the album is \\"Sneaky\\" Pete Kleinow's unorthodox steel guitar playing, which provides an almost continuous commentary throughout some of the songs. As guitarist Bernie Leadon (who wasn't a member of the band yet when this LP was recorded and released) explains to Meyer in Twenty Thousand Roads, \\"Sneaky uniquely played an eight-string Fender cable pull steel tuned to B6 instead of the more common C6. He played [a] usually more jazz or swing tuning in a style that most other players use an E9 tuning for. His rationale was: B is the 'five chord,' or dominant chord, to the key of E. This resulted in absolutely-to-Pete steel licks. And no one else thinks like him anyway.\\" Kleinow also utilized a fuzzbox and played the instrument through a rotating Hammond Leslie amplifier, adding a psychedelic touch to several songs. Most of the songs were written by Parsons and Hillman at a house in the San Fernando Valley dubbed \\"Burrito Manor.\\" \\"Sin City\\", co-written by Hillman and Parsons and called a \\"loping lament\\" and a \\"cautionary dirge\\", mentions The Byrds's manager Larry Spector (\\"a gold plated door\\") and Robert F. Kennedy (\\"tried to clean up this town\\").Boucher, Geoff (2007). \\"'Sin City' The Flying Burrito Brothers ‚Äì 1969\\", LATimes.com. It may have been influenced by The Louvin Brothers.\\"'Sin City'\\", AllMusic.com. In the 2004 documentary Gram Parsons: Fallen Angel, Hillman recalls writing the song with Parsons: \\"Gram was sleeping. I woke up and had this idea, 'This old town's filled with sin, it'll swallow you in.' I got the first verse and most of the chorus and then I said, 'Gram, get up! I got somethin' here.' And he got up and we wrote that song in about thirty minutes. It actually wrote itself.\\" In the same documentary bassist Chris Etheridge adds, \\"I told Gram I had a couple of old melodies from back when I was growin' up...I played 'em for him and we wrote the two songs that day, the \\"Hot Burrito #1\\" and the \\"Hot Burrito #2,\\" and then that night went into the studio and cut 'em.\\" \\"My Uncle\\" and \\"Hippie Boy\\" address then-contemporary countercultural concerns: the draft and the 1968 Democratic National Convention riots. Parsons later explained to Fusion magazine, \\"We kept saying we got to do a song called 'Hippie Boy' about Chicago, and it's got to be a narrative song, and Chris Hillman has to do it...It was the toughest challenge on the album.\\" The two R&B; standards covered on the album, \\"Dark End of the Street\\" and \\"Do Right Woman\\", are examples of a country-soul fusion that Parsons would often refer to as \\"cosmic American music.\\" The Nudie suit of Parsons in the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville Album artwork The album cover features the band in Nudie suits. Parsons had taken the band to designer Nudie Cohn to have custom sequin suits made for all the band members especially for the photo shoot, but Parsons' was most unusual, featuring a naked woman (rendered as an old-school sailor's tattoo on each lapel), red poppies on the shoulders, deep-green marijuana leaves on the front, and embroidered Seconal and Tuinal pills scattered elsewhere. Paradoxically, Parsons asked that a flaming red cross surrounded by radiating shafts of blue and gold light cover the back of the jacket. The suit now hangs in the Country Music Hall of Fame. Tom Wilkes, who was the head of the art department at A&M; at the time, explained to director Gandulf Hennig in 2004, \\"We decided to take them out to the desert and do something kind of surreal with the Nudie suits. And they looked great anyway. They looked funky and kind of country western and kind of rock. I felt that look was great. They didn't really need the Nudie suits.\\" The album cover was shot by Barry Feinstein. Reception The Gilded Palace of Sin was not a commercial success, peaking at #164 on the Billboard 200. At the time of its release, John Firminger wrote in Country Music Review that the album \\"quite clearly stands as a complete definition of the term country rock, using a heavy instrumental approach combining strong country roots.\\" Allan Jones, writing in the influential British rock weekly NME, raved, \\"Let me discourse on the sheer magnificence contained within the micro-grooves of Gilded Palace of Sin.\\" In the original Rolling Stone review of the album, Stanley Booth called it \\"one of the best records of the year\\" and the best, most personal music Parsons had ever done. When Rolling Stone asked Bob Dylan to name his favorite country-rock album, he answered, \\"The Flying Burrito Brothers. Boy, I love them. Their record instantly knocked me out.\\" The album has since become regarded as one of the most groundbreaking of the 1960s. Rolling Stone included it on their list of \\"The 100 Best Debut Albums of All Time,\\" writing that \\"in many ways, Gilded Palace picks up where the Byrds' Sweetheart of the Rodeo left off...Together, the mercurial Parsons and the levelheaded Hillman concocted a crazily coherent statement of irony- fueled hillbilly anthems, inventive covers and achingly beautiful two-part harmonies, all underscored by Sneaky Pete Kleinow's radical pedal-steel guitar.\\" In a 5 star review, AllMusic's Mark Deming raves, \\"...no one ever brought rock and country together quite like the Flying Burrito Brothers, and this album remains their greatest accomplishment.\\" In his article \\"The Lost Boy,\\" John Harris of Mojo writes that the album \\"remains an absolute delight, founded on the poetry that came from the juxtaposition of country music's air of sincere honesty with songs that drew much of their inspiration from the synthetic expanse of Los Angeles.\\" Influence Like Sweetheart of the Rodeo, The Gilded Palace of Sin was not a commercial success. To date, the RIAA has not certified it gold. However, its impact on popular music has grown over the years, influencing, for example, the Eagles. During the 1980s, the New Traditionalist movement in mainstream country music was influenced by The Gilded Palace of Sin, with artists such as Travis Tritt, Vince Gill, Alan Jackson, Clint Black and Randy Travis. Today, The Gilded Palace of Sin continues to influence the alternative country movement, often referred to as \\"alt-country.\\" Bands like Uncle Tupelo, Wilco, Son Volt, Whiskeytown, and the Jayhawks, as well as such musicians as Dwight Yoakam, Lucinda Williams, Emmylou Harris (Parsons' one-time singing partner), and Steve Earle all have recorded music that bears traces of The Gilded Palace of Sin. Non-country artists like Elvis Costello have cited the album as a particular favorite, with Costello covering several cuts during his career; similarly, Dinosaur Jr. have covered the song \\"Hot Burrito #2\\" on their album Green Mind. In the liner notes for the 1997 reissue, Sid Griffin wrote that while Gilded Palace only sold 50,000 copies, \\"...like the first album by the Velvet Underground, it would seem everyone of those 50,000 went out and formed a band inspired by what they'd heard.\\" For years, the album was never reissued in its entirety on compact disc in the United States. However, in 2000 the complete album was reissued as part of a two-disc set, Hot Burritos! The Flying Burrito Brothers Anthology 1969‚Äì1972. In 2002, a new mastering was issued on a single-disc release Sin City: The Very Best of the Flying Burrito Brothers, which packaged The Gilded Palace of Sin with its successor, Burrito Deluxe, as well as a few outtakes from the same period. In 2003, the album was ranked number 192 in Rolling Stone the 500 greatest albums of all time, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list. In 2013, the album was ranked number 99 in Rolling Stone \\"The 100 Best Debut Albums of All Time\\". The album was included in the 2014 Rolling Stone \\"50 Rock Albums Every Country Fan Should Own\\". It was ranked number 620 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums, 3rd Edition (2000). Reissues In early 2017, independent record label Intervention Records released a 180-gram vinyl reissue of The Gilded Palace of Sin. The reissue was remastered by Kevin Gray, using a 1/2\\" safety copy of the original master tapes and includes an \\"old-style\\" jacket featuring the original album artwork printed by Stoughton Printing. In late 2017, it was reissued on hybrid SACD by Intervention Records.

Today, the term Hangu Pass refers to two locations: firstly, to a museum park including a reconstruction of the gate in Lingbao county, Sanmenxia city, Henan and secondly, to the archaeological site of the gate in Xin‚Äôan county, Luoyang city, Henan. History Chinese legend states that Lao-tzu wrote his Tao Te Ching at the insistence of Yinxi, an astrologer and the guard at Hangu Pass, before leaving for the west. The state of Qin fortified the pass in 361 as its eastern border, protecting access to their homeland from the armies of the other Warring States competing to succeed the Zhou. It continued to protect the Guanzhong area of the Qin and Western Han empires. Under the Eastern Han that succeeded Wang Mang's \\"Xin dynasty\\", its fortifications protected the capital Luoyang in the other direction, staving off attacks coming from the west and northwest. After the fall of the Han and rise of the Three Kingdoms, the Hangu Pass lost most of its importance as the primary fortifications moved a little west to Tong Pass.  Archaeological site  Between 2012 and 2013 a team from the Luoyang Cultural Relics and Archaeological Institution conducted an archaeological excavation at the site in Xin'an, Luoyang, on an area of more than 3,000 square meters. This excavation brought several roads, platforms and walls to light. Today, the archaeological site of the Hangu Pass in Xin‚Äôan is a museum park. It is also recognized by UNESCO as part of the world heritage site ‚ÄúSilk Roads‚Äù.  Hangu Pass in fiction  In Kingdom manga and anime, this pass was the last chokepoint Li Mu and his 5 allied Coalition Army in order to defeat Qin. Their attacks were repelled with great losses, forcing Li Mu to make a decision of attacking Xianyang via Zui.

Oregon Hill overlooks the James River and Belle Isle, and provides access to Hollywood Cemetery. Due to the neighborhood's proximity to the Monroe Park Campus of Virginia Commonwealth University, the neighborhood is sometimes referred to as a student quarter because of its high college student population. William Byrd III established a rural estate on the property in 1758. Wealthy heiress Grace Arents helped build many institutions to serve the community.Oregon Hill National Park Service History In 1758, William Byrd III built his country house Belvidere on this hill, with views of the James River as well as Church Hill (Richmond, Virginia) and Shockoe Hill. Fire destroyed the house and gardens about a century later, by which time the neighborhood had transformed from an agricultural to industrial one. Construction of the James River and Kanawha Canal beginning in 1785 brought not only boatman, but merchants, millers and iron workers to the neighborhood. Important Quakers who lived in the Oregon Hill neighborhood included Robert Pleasants,http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/hiway_markers/marker.cfm?mid=4378 and later Samuel Pleasants Parsons, who became superintendent of the Virginia Penitentiary, which once stood on Belvidere Street. As General Superintendent of the canal company, Parsons oversaw its expansion to Lynchburg, Virginia. In 1817, the Harvie family, which owned most of the neighborhood, subdivided it into lots, which were sold to blacks as well as whites. The Baker House, built by a \\"free person of color\\" on Belvidere Street circa 1850, was moved in the 1920s to 617 Cherry Street.http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/richmond/OregonHillHD.html The neighborhood's name refers to quips that employees moving there to be close to their workplace might as well be moving westward to Oregon. The Tredegar Iron Works and Albemarle Paper Company became major employers by the 1850s. In 1849, the Hollywood Cemetery was developed from what had been known as Harvie's Woods at the edge of the neighborhood. Most early buildings in the current historic district date from industrial expansion during Reconstruction following the Civil War, when state office buildings also replaced some single-family housing. Richmond annexed the neighborhood in 1869. The oldest surviving church building is the Pine Street Baptist Church,http://pinestbaptist.com/ built in 1886. The city acquired the land which became Riverside Park, delimiting the neighborhood's southern edge, in 1889. The park keeper's house dates from 1900, but many of the walkways and other buildings were constructed by the Works Progress Administration in the 1930s. The park sustained substantial damage from tropical storm Gaston in 2004. In the early 1940s, the neighborhood saw a large fluxation of Jewish immigrants fleeing Eastern Europe. The population was extrapolated in the 1960s due to segregation laws. St. Andrew's Church started as a Sunday school mission of St. Paul's Episcopal Church in 1873. A brick structure replaced the original wood frame building in 1901.http://standrewsoregonhill.org/pages/page.asp?page_id=115976 In 1894, Richmond philanthropist Grace Arents (niece of Lewis Ginter) established a kindergarten, which later expanded into St. Andrews School, and ultimately the St. Andrew's Church Complex. Around the same time, Sadie Cabaniss, superintendent of the nursing school at Old Dominion Hospital (now VCU School of Nursing), founded the Nurse's Settlement House, now known as the William Byrd Community House.http://www.wbch.org/?page_id=151 All three continue to the current day, with separate but complementary missions among the neighborhood's (and metropolitan area's) working families. Today Oregon Hill is currently bordered by Cary St. to the north, Belvidere St. to the east, The James River and Canal to the south, and by the Hollywood cemetery and Linden St. to the west. It is located only a few blocks south of Virginia Commonwealth University. With generally low-rent townhouses, it is a popular place for students to rent houses or apartments. It is also known as a white working-class enclave. Recently, there has been much development throughout Oregon Hill. This development has occurred in several forms. Infill projects have erected houses in lots that were previously vacant due to fires or other demolition. Many old buildings have either been torn down and replaced with townhouses, or renovated. As of 2007, a new townhouse complex called The Overlook has been mostly completed and inhabited on the blocks overlooking the James River. Possibly one of the most important sites in this neighborhood is Moss's House. Restaurants in Oregon Hill include Mamma Zu and L'opossum, of which Tom Hanks has visited both. Up until the 1990s, original housing stock stood on and was inhabited in this area. It was demolished and the land stood vacant after 1997, during which time it was used as a riverside park overlooking the James. The complete demolition of all the houses on these 3 blocks was a source of bitter contention between the neighborhood and the Ethyl Corporation, which owned the land. Some original houses still look over the river to the west of this development. Due to the major development, and the accompanying rise in property taxes and general cost of living, many families who have lived in Oregon Hill for generations are selling their homes or finding their rents unaffordable. The northernmost blocks in the neighborhood, (the furthest from the James River), have become notorious for housing low-income Caucasian families, and illicit drug use has become rife. In 2013, there were 79 narcotic possession arrests on one block alone. Bordering to the north of the neighborhood is Fine Foods, a popular market offering a large variety of snacks and convenience goods, owned by a family of Sri Lankan immigrants who also live on the property. The business is best known for its vintage posters on display, featuring bikini models from various Super Bowls throughout the 1990s.

Patricia Cornwell, mystery novelist, has written many books loosely based in and around the neighborhood for her Dr. Kay Scarpetta series. Oregon Hill is the first book of Howard Owen's Willie Black mystery series. As the New York Times Sunday Book Review said, \\"Owen has recruited his sick, sad and creatively crazy characters from a rough neighborhood cut off from the rest of the city when the expressway was built.

It is determined by the voltage and impedance of the supply system. It is of the order of a few thousand amperes for a standard domestic mains electrical installation, but may be as low as a few milliamperes in a separated extra-low voltage (SELV) system or as high as hundreds of thousands of amps in large industrial power systems. Protective devices such as circuit breakers and fuses must be selected with an interrupting rating that exceeds the prospective short-circuit current, if they are to safely protect the circuit from a fault. When a large electric current is interrupted an arc forms, and if the breaking capacity of a fuse or circuit breaker is exceeded, it will not extinguish the arc. Current will continue, resulting in damage to equipment, fire, or explosion. Residential In designing domestic power installations, the short-circuit current available on the electrical outlets should not be too high or too low. The effect of too high short-circuit current is discussed in the previous section. The short-circuit current should be around 20 times the rating of the circuit to ensure the branch circuit protection clears a fault quickly. Quick disconnecting is needed, because during a line-to-ground short circuit the grounding pin potential on the power outlet can rise relative to the local earth (concrete floor, water pipe etc.) to a dangerous voltage, which needs to be shut down quickly for safety. If the short-circuit current is lower than this figure, special precautions need to be taken to make sure that the system is safe; those usually include using a residual- current device (a.k.a. ground fault interrupter) for extra protection. The short-circuit current available on the electrical outlets is often tested when inspecting new electrical installations to make sure that the short-circuit current is within reasonable limits. A high short-circuit current on the outlet also shows that the resistance from the electrical panel to the outlet is low, so there won't be an unacceptably high voltage drop on the wires under normal load. The resistance path is the total resistance back through the supply transformer; to measure this an engineer will use an \\"earth fault loop impedance meter\\". The application of a low voltage allows a small current to pass from the socket back through earth to the supply transformer and distribution board. The resistance measured can be used to calculate the short-circuit current. Utility and industrial In power transmission systems and industrial power systems, often the short-circuit current is calculated from the nameplate impedances of connected equipment and the impedance of interconnecting wiring. For simple radial distribution systems with only a few elements, hand calculation is feasible, but computer software is generally used for more complex systems. Where rotating machines (generators and motors) are present in the system, the time-varying effect of their contribution to a short circuit may be evaluated. Stored energy in a generator may contribute much more current to a short circuit in the first few cycles than later on; this affects the interrupting rating selected for circuit breakers and fuses. An isolated generator may be specially designed to ensure that it can source enough current on a short circuit to allow subordinate overcurrent protection devices to operate properly. Where an industrial system is fed from an electrical utility, the short circuit level at the point of connection may be specified, often with minimum and maximum values or values to be expected after system growth. This allows calculation by an industrial customer of its internal fault levels within its plant. If the prospective short-circuit current from the utility source is very large compared to the customer's system size, an \\"infinite bus\\" is assumed, with zero effective internal impedance; the only limit to the prospective short- circuit current is then the impedances after the defined \\"infinite bus\\". In polyphase electrical systems, generally phase-to-phase, phase-to-ground (earth), and phase-to-neutral faults are examined, as well as a case where all three phases are short-circuited. Because impedances of cables or devices varies between phases, the prospective short-circuit current varies depending on the type of fault. Protection devices in the system must respond to all three cases. The method of symmetrical components is used to simplify analysis of unsymmetrical faults in three-phase systems.

It includes interior design, but not usually architecture. The decorative arts are often categorized in distinction to the \\"fine arts\\", namely painting, drawing, photography, and large-scale sculpture, which generally produce objects solely for their aesthetic quality and capacity to stimulate the intellect. Distinction from the fine arts Mughal, 17th Century CE. National Museum, New Delhi The distinction between the decorative and fine arts essentially arose from the post-Renaissance art of the West, where the distinction is for the most part meaningful. This distinction is much less meaningful when considering the art of other cultures and periods, where the most valued works, or even all works, include those in decorative media. For example, Islamic art in many periods and places consists entirely of the decorative arts, often using geometric and plant forms, as does the art of many traditional cultures. The distinction between decorative and fine arts is not very useful for appreciating Chinese art, and neither is it for understanding Early Medieval art in Europe. In that period in Europe, fine arts such as manuscript illumination and monumental sculpture existed, but the most prestigious works tended to be in goldsmith work, in cast metals such as bronze, or in other techniques such as ivory carving. Large-scale wall-paintings were much less regarded, crudely executed, and rarely mentioned in contemporary sources. They were probably seen as an inferior substitute for mosaic, which for the period must be considered a fine art, though in recent centuries mosaics have tended to be considered decorative. The term \\"ars sacra\\" (\\"sacred arts\\") is sometimes used for medieval Christian art executed in metal, ivory, textiles, and other more valuable materials but not for rarer secular works from that period. Northern Song Dynasty, 11th or 12th century, porcelaneous pottery with celadon glaze The view of decoration as a 'lesser art' was formally challenged in the 1970s by writers and art historians like Amy Goldin https://www.artforum.com/print/197507/patterns-grids-and- painting-36072 and Anne Swartz.https://www.moca.org/exhibition/with-pleasure The argument for a singular narrative in art had lost traction by the close of the 20th century through post-modernist irony and increasing curatorial interest in street art and in ethnic decorative traditions. The 'Pattern and Decoration Movement' in New York galleries in the 1980s, though short-lived, opened the way to a more inclusive evaluation of the value of art objects.https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-pattern-decoration- movement-challenged-machismo-modernism Influence of different materials Modern understanding of the art of many cultures tends to be distorted by the modern privileging of fine Visual arts media over others, as well as the very different survival rates of works in different media. Works in metal, above all in precious metals, are liable to be \\"recycled\\" as soon as they fall from fashion, and were often used by owners as repositories of wealth, to be melted down when extra money was needed. Illuminated manuscripts have a much higher survival rate, especially in the hands of the church, as there was little value in the materials and they were easy to store. Renaissance attitudes The promotion of the fine arts over the decorative in European thought can largely be traced to the Renaissance, when Italian theorists such as Vasari promoted artistic values, exemplified by the artists of the High Renaissance, that placed little value on the cost of materials or the amount of skilled work required to produce a work, but instead valued artistic imagination and the individual touch of the hand of a supremely gifted master such as Michelangelo, Raphael or Leonardo da Vinci, reviving to some extent the approach of antiquity. Most European art during the Middle Ages had been produced under a very different set of values, where both expensive materials and virtuoso displays in difficult techniques had been highly valued. In China both approaches had co-existed for many centuries: ink and wash painting, mostly of landscapes, was to a large extent produced by and for the scholar- bureaucrats or \\"literati\\", and was intended as an expression of the artist's imagination above all, while other major fields of art, including the very important Chinese ceramics produced in effectively industrial conditions, were produced according to a completely different set of artistic values. Arts and Crafts movement Arts and Crafts movement \\"Artichoke\\" wallpaper by Morris and Co. The lower status given to works of decorative art in contrast to fine art narrowed with the rise of the Arts and Crafts movement. This aesthetic movement of the second half of the 19th century was born in England and inspired by William Morris and John Ruskin. The movement represented the beginning of a greater appreciation of the decorative arts throughout Europe. The appeal of the Arts and Crafts movement to a new generation led the English architect and designer Arthur H. Mackmurdo to organize the Century Guild for craftsmen in 1882, championing the idea that there was no meaningful difference between the fine and decorative arts. Many converts, both from professional artists' ranks and from among the intellectual class as a whole, helped spread the ideas of the movement. The influence of the Arts and Crafts movement led to the decorative arts being given a greater appreciation and status in society and this was soon reflected by changes in the law. Until the enactment of the Copyright Act 1911 only works of fine art had been protected from unauthorised copying. The 1911 Act extended the definition of an \\"artistic work\\" to include works of \\"artistic craftsmanship\\".  Mass production and customization  In the context of mass production and consumerism some individuals will attempt to create or maintain their lifestyle or to construct their identity when forced to accept mass-produced identical objects in their life. According to Campbell in his piece ‚ÄúThe Craft Consumer‚Äù ,Campbell, Colin. \\"The Craft Consumer\\". Journal of Consumer Culture 5.1 (2005). Print. this is done by selecting goods with specific intentions in mind to alter them. Instead of accepting a foreign object for what it is, the foreign object is incorporated and changed to fit one's lifestyle and choices, or customized. One way to achieve a customized look and feel to common objects is to change their external appearance by applying decorative techniques, as in decoupage, art cars, truck art in South Asia and IKEA hacking.

He is famous for his contributions to the fields of antibody formation and immunological tolerance. Early life and education Nossal's family was from Vienna, Austria. He was born four weeks prematurely in Bad Ischl while his mother was on holiday. His family left their home town of Vienna for Australia in 1939 following Nazi Germany's annexation of Austria. As his father's grandparents were Jewish, he was also considered Jewish and at risk of being sent to concentration camps. In an interview with Adam Spencer, Nossal noted that his father was not a professing Jew but of Jewish ethnicity as he had been baptised a Roman Catholic as a child. Nossal remarked that his father \\"therefore thought that he would be somewhat protected from the Holocaust-type predicament. Of course, he hadn't properly read Mein Kampf. It was all spelt out there: if your four grandparents were Jewish, then you were Jewish.\\" He was baptised and remains a practising Roman Catholic. Nossal showed interest in medicine and wanted to become a doctor since the age of seven. When he first attended school in Australia, Nossal spoke no English but he graduated from St Aloysius' College in 1947 as the dux of the College. In 1948, he entered the Sydney Medical School, graduating later with first-class honours. At the age of 26, he left his job in Sydney and moved to Melbourne to work with Macfarlane Burnet in medical science at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and gained his Ph.D. degree in 1960. Religious beliefs On describing his views on religion Nossal said: Career Following the retirement of Macfarlane Burnet in 1965, at the age of 35 Nossal became director of Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, a position that he kept until 1996. In parallel, he was Professor of Medical Biology at the University of Melbourne. Nossal's research is in fundamental immunology, in the field of \\"antibody formation and immunological tolerance\\". He has written five books and 530 scientific articles in this and related fields. Nossal has been President (1970-1973) of the 30,000-member world body of immunology, the International Union of Immunological Societies; President of the Australian Academy of Science (1994-1998); a member of the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council (PMSEIC) (1989 to 1998); and Chairman of the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation (1987-1996). He has been Chairman of the committee overseeing the World Health Organization's Vaccines and Biologicals Program (1993-2002) and Chairman of the Strategic Advisory Council of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Children's Vaccine Program (1998-2003). He was Deputy Chairman of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation from 1998 to 2000.

The Dulcinians, or Dulcinites, and Apostolics were inspired by Franciscan ideals and influenced by the Joachimites, but were considered heretical by the Catholic Church. Their name derives from the movement's leader, Fra Dolcino of Novara (ca. 1250‚Äì1307), who was burned as a heretic on the orders of Pope Clement V. History The Dulcinian sect began in 1300 when Gherardo Segarelli, founder of the Apostolic Brethren, was burned at the stake in Parma during a brutal repression of the Apostolics. His followers went into hiding to save their lives. Fra Dolcino had joined the Apostolics between 1288 and 1292, and became their leader. He published the first of his letters explaining his ideas about the epochs of history based on the theories of Gioacchino da Fiore. Fra Dolcino, at the beginning of 1303, reunited the Apostolic movement near Lake Garda. He met Margaret of Trent (real name Margherita Boninsegna, his lover or sister in spirit), and wrote the second letter to the Apostolics. At the beginning of 1304, three Dulcinians were burned by the Inquisition, leading Dolcino to evacuate the community to the west side of the Sesia valley, near his native Novara. At the end of 1304, only 1400 survived on the top of Mount Parete Calva, in the fortified Piano dei Gazzari. They descended the mountain to pillage and kill the people in the valley, responsible in their eyes for not defending the group against the episcopal troops. The villagers called them \\"Gazzari\\" (Cathars), and joined the soldiers in opposition. Dolcino justified the acts committed by the Dulcinians by affirming their perfection and holiness based on Saint Paul's Epistle to Titus (1:15): > To the pure all things are pure, but to the corrupt and unbelieving nothing > is pure; their very minds and consciences are corrupted. Margaret and Dolcino were captured and executed. Theories The main concepts of the Dulcinian heresy were: * The fall of the ecclesiastical hierarchy, and return of the Church to its original ideals of humility and poverty; * The fall of the feudal system; * Human liberation from any restraint, and from entrenched power; * Creation of a new egalitarian society based on mutual aid and respect, holding property in common and respecting gender equality. Fra Dolcino was inspired by the millenarist theories of Gioacchino da Fiore. He viewed the history of humanity as 4 epochs: *The period of the Old Testament; *The period of Jesus Christ and the Apostles, characterized by chastity and poverty; *The period of Emperor Constantine I and Pope Sylvester I, characterized by the decline of the Church due to ambition and excessive wealth; *The period of the Apostolics, led by Segalelli and Dolcino, characterized by poverty, chastity and the absence of government. In his first letter, Dolcino gave his interpretation of the seven Angels and seven Churches of the Apocalypse of John: *The Angel of Ephesus was Saint Benedict, and his church was the monastic order; *The Angel of Pergamom was Pope Sylvester I, and his church was the clerical order; *The Angel of Sardis was Saint Francis, and his church was the Friars Minor; *The Angel of Laodicea was Saint Dominic, and his church was the Friars Preacher; *The Angel of Smyrna was Gerard of Parma, and his church was the Apostolic Brethren; *The Angel of Thyatira was Fra Dolcino, and his church was the Dulcinian movement; *The Angel of Philadelphia would be the new holy pope, and the last three churches would constitute \\"the new church of these new days\\". Following the death of Boniface VIII, Dolcino produced a schedule of 4 popes: *Celestine V *Boniface VIII: ruin would fall on him and the king of the south *Boniface's successor: ruin would fall on him and all the cardinals *The new holy pope Thus, the advent of the \\"new holy pope\\" was postponed to the second pope after the death of Boniface VIII. Dolcino never proposed himself as the new Pope in his letters, although this was one of the accusations of the Inquisition. The rallying cry Poenitentiam agite (make penitence) was attributed to them in The Name of the Rose, a novel by Umberto Eco.

It is usually found in eukaryotes and mediated by the spliceosome, although some bacteria and archaea also have \\"half-genes\\" for tRNAs.  Genic trans-splicing  Whereas \\"normal\\" (cis-)splicing processes a single molecule, trans-splicing generates a single RNA transcript from multiple separate pre-mRNAs. This phenomenon can be exploited for molecular therapy to address mutated gene products. = Oncogenesis = While some fusion transcripts occur via trans- splicing in normal human cells, trans-splicing can also be the mechanism behind certain oncogenic fusion transcripts.  SL trans-splicing  Spliced leader (SL) trans-splicing is used by certain microorganisms, notably protists of the Kinetoplastae class to express genes. In these organisms, a capped splice leader RNA is transcribed, and simultaneously, genes are transcribed in long polycistrons. The capped splice leader is trans-spliced onto each gene to generate monocistronic capped and polyadenylated transcripts. These early- diverging eukaryotes use few introns, and the spliceosome they possess show some unusual variations in their structure assembly. They also possess multiple eIF4E isoforms with specialized roles in capping. Some other eukaryotes, notably among dinoflagellates, sponges, nematodes, cnidarians, ctenophores, flatworms, crustaceans, chaetognaths, rotifers, and tunicates also use more or less frequently the SL trans-splicing. In the tunicate Ciona intestinalis, the extent of SL trans-splicing is better described by a quantitative view recognising frequently and infrequently trans-spliced genes rather than a binary and conventional categorisation of trans-spliced versus non-trans-spliced genes. One function of the SL trans-splicing is the resolution of polycistronic transcripts of operons into individual 5'-capped mRNAs. This processing is achieved when the outrons are trans-spliced to unpaired, downstream acceptor sites adjacent to cistron open reading frames.

She is the founder and director of the Bard Graduate Center (BGC) for studies in the decorative arts, design history, and material culture affiliated with Bard College in Dutchess County, New York. She was previously married to George Soros. Early life and education Susan Weber was born in Brooklyn, New York City, the daughter of Iris and Murray Weber. Her father was a manufacturer of shoe accessories; her mother was a housewife. Her father was born in New York City to parents who had emigrated from Russia. Her mother passed on her fondness for the decorative arts. She grew up in the New York City area in a non-observant Jewish household; summing up her upbringing, Weber stated: \\"We were cultural Jews.\\" She attended an Episcopalian high school in Brooklyn and graduated from Barnard College of Columbia University with a degree in art history. In 1990, she earned a master's degree from Cooper-Hewitt/Parsons. She also studied at the Royal College of Art in London, where she earned her Ph.D. degree (1998) with a thesis on the furniture of E. W. Godwin. Career Weber was executive director of the Open Society Institute (OSI), the umbrella name for some 24 independent foundations that support the advancement of freedom of expression around the globe. OSI also supports cultural exchange through grants to individuals and associations. In 1991, Soros was turned down for the job of director of graduate education at the Parsons School of Design. So, with $20 million of her husband's money, she started her own school in 1993, establishing the Bard Graduate Center where she is professor of the history of the decorative arts. BGC offers graduate degrees in history of the decorative and applied arts, cultural and design history, garden history, and landscape studies. The Bard Center is one of only four places in the United States where a student can obtain an advanced degree in the decorative arts. The others are the Winterthur Museum program affiliated with the University of Delaware, the Parsons program., and the George Washington University in partnership with the Smithsonian. Personal life In 1983, Weber married billionaire George Soros, twenty-four years her senior, and the primary contributor to the Open Society Institute (OSI). They had two children, Alexander (born 1985) and Gregory (born 1988). They divorced in 2005. Bibliography * Soros, Susan Weber (ed.) (2006).

The fjord is also an excellent place for waterskiing and wakeboarding, but also for more quiet activities. History Sagesund got its name from a sash saw mill, located in a creek. The lumbermill was used by local farmers. In the 19th century there were three shipyards here, building sailing ships, brigs, barques, schooners, etc. There used to be a large ice storage building. It was used to hold ice that was to be exported. In the 1950s, there were three stores, a post office, a galvanic workshop, an assembly house, and an electric sawmill. The sailboat Origo started and ended its circumnavigation of the world from Sagesund in 1994. Nor Siglar, with half the crew from Sagesund, also included Sagesund as a natural stop on its way around the globe.

He is known primarily as an ambient music composer. He began euphonium lessons at 12, and at 16 entered Colchester Institute to study music. On graduating, and after a period of busking in London (where he briefly shared a house with artists Mark Wallinger and Andy Dog), he returned to Colchester to run a music therapy course at a local hospital for people with learning difficulties. His first recording experience was in 1983 with his brother Brian Eno and Canadian producer and musician Daniel Lanois for the album Apollo at Lanois' Grant Avenue Studios in Canada. His first solo album, Voices, was released in 1985. Although mainly regarded as a pianist, Eno is a multi-instrumentalist and singer, as demonstrated on his later solo albums and collaborations. He has worked with several key artists apart from his brother including Bill Nelson, No-Man, Lol Hammond, Mads Arp, Peter Hammill, Gaudi, Tim Bowness and Michael Brook, the most successful of which was probably his co-written album The Familiar, with Kate St John. Eno performs live on occasions and continues to write soundtracks. Much of his music has been used in films, including For All Mankind, Nine and a Half Weeks, Warm Summer Rain and The Jacket, while tracks have been used in advertisements, including for Nissan and for Japan Railways. Eno has recently recorded solo albums for, and established an online shop via, the UK-based internet label Burning Shed. In 2007, he contributed to the Mid/Air LP by Dive Index, a collaborative music project of composer/producer Will Thomas. In 2013 Eno released a new album, Endless City / Concrete Garden, under the name Roger Eno / Plumbline. A collection of Eno's work from 1988 to 1998, Little Things Left Behind, was released in November 2013. In 2015, Eno featured playing piano on two tracks (\\"A Boat Lies Waiting\\" and \\"Beauty\\") on David Gilmour's solo album, Rattle That Lock. On 10 November 2017, Eno released a solo album, This Floating World, on Recital Records. On June 23, 2019, he performed at the Dark Mofo in Hobart, Tasmania.

A full-rigged ship is said to have a ship rig or be ship-rigged. Sometimes such a vessel will merely be called a ship in 18th- to early-19th-century and earlier usage, to distinguish it from other large three-masted blue-water working vessels such as barques, barquentines, fluyts etc. This full or ship-rig sail plan thus is a term of art that differentiates such vessels as well from other working or cargo vessels with widely diverse alternative sail-plans such as galleons, cogs, sloops, caravels, schooners, brigs and carracks; some of which also have three masted variants (brigs, schooners, sloops, and galleons). The ship-rig sail plan also differs drastically from the large panoply of one and two masted vessels found as working and recreational sailboats. Alternatively, a full-rigged ship may be referred to by its function instead, as in collier or frigate, rather than being called a ship. In many languages the word frigate or frigate rig refers to a full-rigged ship. Masts , a French-built ship- rigged frigate of the late 18th century The masts of a full-rigged ship, from bow to stern, are: * Foremast, which is the second tallest mast * Mainmast, the tallest * Mizzenmast, the third tallest * Jiggermast, which may not be present but will be fourth tallest if so There is no standard name for a fifth mast on a ship-rigged vessel (though this may be called the spanker mast on a barque, schooner or barquentine). Only one five-masted full-rigged ship (the Flying P-Liner Preussen) had ever been built until recent years, when a few modern five-masted cruise sailing ships have been launched. Even a fourth mast is relatively rare for full-rigged ships. Ships with five and more masts are not normally fully rigged and their masts may be numbered rather than named in extreme cases. If the masts are of wood, each mast is in three or more pieces. They are (in order, from bottom up): * The lowest piece is called the mast or the lower. * Topmast * Topgallant mast * Royal mast, if fitted On steel-masted vessels, the corresponding sections of the mast are named after the traditional wooden sections. Sails Ship Garthsnaid at sea, c. 1920 Bor√©e stopped. The lowest and normally largest sail on a mast is the course sail of that mast, and is referred to simply by the mast name: Foresail, mainsail, mizzen sail, jigger sail or more commonly forecourse etc. Note that even a full-rigged ship did not usually have a lateral (square) course on the mizzen mast below the mizzen topmast. Instead, the lowest sail on the mizzen was usually a fore/aft sail‚Äîoriginally a lateen sail, but later a gaff sail called a spanker or driver. The key distinction between a \\"ship\\" and \\"barque\\" (in modern usage) is that a \\"ship\\" carries a square-rigged mizzen topsail (and therefore that its mizzen mast has a topsail yard and a cross-jack yard) whereas the mizzen mast of a barque has only fore-and-aft rigged sails. The cross-jack yard was the lowest yard on a ship's mizzen mast. Unlike the corresponding yards on the fore and main mast it did not usually have fittings to hang a sail from: its purpose was to control the lower edge of the topsail. In the rare case that the cross-jack yard did carry a square sail, this sail would be called the cross-jack rather than the mizzen course. Above the course sail, in order, are: * Topsail, or ** Lower topsail, if fitted. ** Upper topsail, if fitted. * Topgallant sail, or ** Lower topgallant sail, if fitted. ** Upper topgallant sail, if fitted. * Royal sail, if fitted. *Skysail, if fitted. *Moonraker, if fitted. The division of a sail into upper and lower sails was a matter of practicality, since undivided sails were larger and, consequently, more difficult to handle. Larger sails necessitated hiring, and paying, a larger crew. Additionally, the great size of some late-19th and 20th century vessels meant that their correspondingly large sails would have been impossible to handle had they not been divided. Jibs are carried forward of the foremast, are tacked down on the bowsprit or jib-boom and have varying naming conventions. Staysails may be carried between any other mast and the one in front of it or from the foremast to the bowsprit. They are named after the mast from which they are hoisted, so for example a staysail hoisted to the top of the mizzen topgallant on a stay running to the top of the main topmast would be called the mizzen topgallant staysail. In light winds studding sails (pronounced \\"stunsls\\") may be carried on either side of any or all of the square rigged sails except royals and skysails. They are named after the adjacent sail and the side of the vessel on which they are set, for example main topgallant starboard stu'nsail. One or more spritsails may also be set on booms set athwart and below the bowsprit. One or two spankers are carried aft of the aftmost mast, if two they are called the upper spanker and lower spanker. A fore-and-aft topsail may be carried above the upper or only spanker, and is called the gaff sail. To stop a full-rigged ship except when running directly down wind, the sails of the foremast are oriented in the direction perpendicular to those of the mainmast. Thus, the masts cancel out of their push on the ship.Willaumez, p. 434 This allows the crew to stop and quickly restart the ship without retracting and lowering the sails, and to dynamically compensate for the push of the wind on the masts themselves and the yards. Running downwind the sails still need to be lowered to bring the ship to a halt.

He was known for large-scale abstract works of public art as well as more iconographic statues and busts of noted 20th-century figures such as Winston Churchill and members of the British Royal Family. Biography He was born in Brno, Czechoslovakia, in 1921, the son of the economist Josef Bƒõlsk√Ω. With his family, he fled to the United Kingdom after the German invasion of Czechoslovakia, and volunteered for the Czechoslovak Exile Army. He fought in the Battle of France as a gunner and was twice mentioned in dispatches, once for carving a memorial stone to Czechoslovak soldiers whilst stationed at Cholmondeley, Cheshire, and again in 1944 when he was awarded the Czech bravery award for repairing a telephone line in France while under enemy fire. In 1940, the Czechoslovak Exile Army was evacuated to Britain along with other Allied forces in the Dunkirk evacuation. Five weeks later, the Czechoslovaks were presented in a military parade for ceremonial inspection by the then Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Belsky recalled that Churchill stopped in front him, leaning on his walking stick with his chin thrust out, holding his hat in his hand, and looked Belsky in the eye for a prolonged time. Under Churchill's gaze, Belsky thought, \\"You wait, one day I shall model a statue of you, just like this\\". Career Belsky was demobbed and returned to Prague after the war, and he found that many of his relations had perished in the Holocaust. He studied under the sculptor Otakar ≈†paniel at the Academy of Fine Arts, Prague. While in Prague, he also designed a paratroop memorial, and a medal in honour of the Czech Olympic athlete Emil Z√°topek, before fleeing again to escape the Communist takeover in 1948. Belsky continued his studies at the Royal College of Art, studying under Frank Dobson and John Skeaping, graduating with an Honours Diploma in 1950. He received his first public commission for the Festival of Britain in 1951. A number of commissions followed, and was awarded the medal for sculpture by the Paris Salon, winning bronze in 1955 and silver in 1956. His work included not only traditional statues and busts, but also large-scale more abstract works. He produced a number of statues of Winston Churchill; his 1969 statue at the Winston Churchill Memorial and Library in Fulton, Missouri was commissioned to mark the 25th anniversary of Churchill's \\"Iron Curtain\\" speech. Belsky's royal busts are in the National Portrait Gallery, London. Belsky was the first foreign-born sculptor to create a work for Trafalgar Square, a bust of Admiral Cunningham unveiled in 1970. Belsky's statue of Lord Louis Mountbatten stands in Horse Guards Parade in London, and in the National Theatre is his statue of Lord Cottesloe. Belsky also designed the Torsion Fountain at the Shell Centre in London and the Totem sculpture which was erected in 1977 in the Arndale Centre, Manchester. His studio was at his cottage in Sutton Courtenay, Oxfordshire. In 1990, Belsky returned to Prague and worked on two monumental works, a statue of Winston Churchill outside the British Embassy and a memorial to Czechoslovaks who had served with the British Royal Air Force. Belsky was awarded the Medal of Merit by the then President of Czechoslovakia, Vaclav Havel, in 1999. Among other honors Belsky won the Otto Beit Medal of the Royal British Society of Sculptors in 1976 for excellence in sculpture. Personal life In 1944, he married Margaret Owen the newspaper cartoonist, who signed her own work Belsky. After her death in 1989, in 1996 he remarried fellow sculptor Irena Sedleck√°. Death and burial Franta Belsky died in Abingdon-on-Thames from prostate cancer on 5 July 2000. He was buried in the churchyard of All Saints' Church, Sutton Courtenay.

Electricity meter with transparent plastic case (Israel) North American domestic electronic electricity meter An electricity meter, electric meter, electrical meter, or energy meter is a device that measures the amount of electric energy consumed by a residence, a business, or an electrically powered device. Electric utilities use electric meters installed at customers' premises for billing and monitoring purposes. They are typically calibrated in billing units, the most common one being the kilowatt hour (kWh). They are usually read once each billing period. When energy savings during certain periods are desired, some meters may measure demand, the maximum use of power in some interval. \\"Time of day\\" metering allows electric rates to be changed during a day, to record usage during peak high- cost periods and off-peak, lower-cost, periods. Also, in some areas meters have relays for demand response load shedding during peak load periods.E.g., Minnkota Power's Load Management System , accessed 22 August 2009.  History  = Direct current = An Aron type DC electricity meter showing that the calibration was in charge consumed rather than energy As commercial use of electric energy spread in the 1880s, it became increasingly important that an electric energy meter, similar to the then existing gas meters, was required to properly bill customers, instead of billing for a fixed number of lamps per month. DC meters measured charge in ampere hours. Since the voltage of the supply should remain substantially constant, the reading of the meter was proportional to actual energy consumed. For example, if a meter recorded that 100 ampere hours had been consumed on a 200-volt supply, then 20 kilowatt- hours of energy had been supplied. Many experimental types of meter were developed. Thomas Edison at first worked on a direct current (DC) electromechanical meter with a direct reading register, but instead developed an electrochemical metering system, which used an electrolytic cell to totalise current consumption. At periodic intervals the plates were removed and weighed, and the customer billed. The electrochemical meter was labor- intensive to read and not well received by customers. A 'Reason' meter An early type of electrochemical meter used in the United Kingdom was the 'Reason' meter. This consisted of a vertically mounted glass structure with a mercury reservoir at the top of the meter. As current was drawn from the supply, electrochemical action transferred the mercury to the bottom of the column. Like all other DC meters, it recorded ampere hours. Once the mercury pool was exhausted, the meter became an open circuit. It was therefore necessary for the consumer to pay for a further supply of electricity, whereupon, the supplier's agent would unlock the meter from its mounting and invert it restoring the mercury to the reservoir and the supply. In 1885 Ferranti offered a mercury motor meter with a register similar to gas meters; this had the advantage that the consumer could easily read the meter and verify consumption.Graeme Gooday The morals of measurement: accuracy, irony,and trust in late Victorian electrical practice, Cambridge University Press, 2004 , p 232‚Äì241 The first accurate, recording electricity consumption meter was a DC meter by Dr Hermann Aron, who patented it in 1883. Hugo Hirst of the British General Electric Company introduced it commercially into Great Britain from 1888. Aron's meter recorded the total charge used over time, and showed it on a series of clock dials. = Alternating current = The first specimen of the AC kilowatt-hour meter produced on the basis of Hungarian Ott√≥ Bl√°thy's patent and named after him was presented by the Ganz Works at the Frankfurt Fair in the autumn of 1889, and the first induction kilowatt-hour meter was already marketed by the factory at the end of the same year. These were the first alternating-current watt-hour meters, known by the name of Bl√°thy-meters. The AC kilowatt hour meters used at present operate on the same principle as Bl√°thy's original invention. Student paper read on January 24, 1896 at the Students' Meeting.The Electrical engineer, Volume 5. (February, 1890)The Electrician, Volume 50. 1923Official gazette of the United States Patent Office: Volume 50. (1890) Also around 1889, Elihu Thomson of the American General Electric company developed a recording watt meter (watt-hour meter) based on an ironless commutator motor. This meter overcame the disadvantages of the electrochemical type and could operate on either alternating or direct current.W. Bernard Carlson, Innovation as a Social Process: Elihu Thomson and the Rise of General Electric, Cambridge University Press, 2003 , pages 1 and 258 In 1894 Oliver Shallenberger of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation applied the induction principle previously used U.S. Patent 388003 only in AC ampere hour meters to produce a watt-hour meter of the modern electromechanical form, using an induction disk whose rotational speed was made proportional to the power in the circuit.Stephen A. Dyer (ed.) Survey of instrumentation and measurementWiley-IEEE, 2001 , page 875 The Bl√°thy meter was similar to Shallenberger and Thomson meter in that they are two-phase motor meter. Although the induction meter would only work on alternating current, it eliminated the delicate and troublesome commutator of the Thomson design. Shallenberger fell ill and was unable to refine his initial large and heavy design, although he did also develop a polyphase version.  Units  solid state electricity meter, connected to a 2 MVA electricity substation. Remote current and voltage sensors can be read and programmed remotely by modem and locally by infra-red. The circle with two dots is the infra-red port. Tamper-evident seals can be seen The most common unit of measurement on the electricity meter is the kilowatt hour [kWh], which is equal to the amount of energy used by a load of one kilowatt over a period of one hour, or 3,600,000 joules. Some electricity companies use the SI megajoule instead. Demand is normally measured in watts, but averaged over a period, most often a quarter- or half-hour. Reactive power is measured in \\"thousands of volt-ampere reactive-hours\\", (kvarh). By convention, a \\"lagging\\" or inductive load, such as a motor, will have positive reactive power. A \\"leading\\", or capacitive load, will have negative reactive power.IEEE Recommended practice for industrial and commercial power systems analysis Standard 399-1997, IEEE, page 47 Volt-amperes measures all power passed through a distribution network, including reactive and actual. This is equal to the product of root-mean-square volts and amperes. Distortion of the electric current by loads is measured in several ways. Power factor is the ratio of resistive (or real) power to volt-amperes. A capacitive load has a leading power factor, and an inductive load has a lagging power factor. A purely resistive load (such as a filament lamp, heater or kettle) exhibits a power factor of 1. Current harmonics are a measure of distortion of the wave form. For example, electronic loads such as computer power supplies draw their current at the voltage peak to fill their internal storage elements. This can lead to a significant voltage drop near the supply voltage peak which shows as a flattening of the voltage waveform. This flattening causes odd harmonics which are not permissible if they exceed specific limits, as they are not only wasteful, but may interfere with the operation of other equipment. Harmonic emissions are mandated by law in EU and other countries to fall within specified limits. In addition to metering based on the amount of energy used, other types of metering are available. Meters which measured the amount of charge (coulombs) used, known as ampere hour meters, were used in the early days of electrification. These were dependent upon the supply voltage remaining constant for accurate measurement of energy usage, which was not a likely circumstance with most supplies. The most common application was in relation to special-purpose meters to monitor charge / discharge status of large batteries. Some meters measured only the length of time for which charge flowed, with no measurement of the magnitude of voltage or current being made. These are only suited for constant-load applications and are rarely used today.  Operation  Mechanism of electromechanical induction meter. 1: Voltage coil: many turns of fine wire encased in plastic, connected in parallel with load. 2: Current coil: three turns of thick wire, connected in series with load. 3: Stator: concentrates and confines magnetic field. 4: Aluminum rotor disc. 5: rotor brake magnets. 6: spindle with worm gear. 7: display dials: the 1/10, 10 and 1000 dials rotate clockwise while the 1, 100 and 10000 dials rotate counter-clockwise Electricity meters operate by continuously measuring the instantaneous voltage (volts) and current (amperes) to give energy used (in joules, kilowatt-hours etc.). Meters for smaller services (such as small residential customers) can be connected directly in- line between source and customer. For larger loads, more than about 200 ampere of load, current transformers are used, so that the meter can be located other than in line with the service conductors. The meters fall into two basic categories, electromechanical and electronic. = Electromechanical = The most common type of electricity meter is the electromechanical watt-hour meter. On a single-phase AC supply, the electromechanical induction meter operates through electromagnetic induction by counting the revolutions of a non-magnetic, but electrically conductive, metal disc which is made to rotate at a speed proportional to the power passing through the meter. The number of revolutions is thus proportional to the energy usage. The voltage coil consumes a small and relatively constant amount of power, typically around 2 watts which is not registered on the meter. The current coil similarly consumes a small amount of power in proportion to the square of the current flowing through it, typically up to a couple of watts at full load, which is registered on the meter. The disc is acted upon by two sets of induction coils, which form, in effect, a two phase linear induction motor. One coil is connected in such a way that it produces a magnetic flux in proportion to the voltage and the other produces a magnetic flux in proportion to the current. The field of the voltage coil is delayed by 90 degrees, due to the coil's inductive nature, and calibrated using a lag coil. This produces eddy currents in the disc and the effect is such that a force is exerted on the disc in proportion to the product of the instantaneous current, voltage and phase angle (power factor) between them. A permanent magnet acts as an eddy current brake, exerting an opposing force proportional to the speed of rotation of the disc. The equilibrium between these two opposing forces results in the disc rotating at a speed proportional to the power or rate of energy usage. The disc drives a register mechanism which counts revolutions, much like the odometer in a car, in order to render a measurement of the total energy used. Different phase configurations use additional voltage and current coils. Three-phase electromechanical induction meter, metering 100 A 240/415 V supply. Horizontal aluminium rotor disc is visible in centre of meter The disc is supported by a spindle which has a worm gear which drives the register. The register is a series of dials which record the amount of energy used. The dials may be of the cyclometer type, an odometer-like display that is easy to read where for each dial a single digit is shown through a window in the face of the meter, or of the pointer type where a pointer indicates each digit. With the dial pointer type, adjacent pointers generally rotate in opposite directions due to the gearing mechanism. The amount of energy represented by one revolution of the disc is denoted by the symbol Kh which is given in units of watt-hours per revolution. The value 7.2 is commonly seen. Using the value of Kh one can determine their power consumption at any given time by timing the disc with a stopwatch. P = {{3600 \\\\cdot Kh } \\\\over t}. Where: :: = time in seconds taken by the disc to complete one revolution, :: = power in watts. For example, if = 7.2 as above, and one revolution took place in 14.4 seconds, the power is 1800 watts. This method can be used to determine the power consumption of household devices by switching them on one by one. Most domestic electricity meters must be read manually, whether by a representative of the power company or by the customer. Where the customer reads the meter, the reading may be supplied to the power company by telephone, post or over the internet. The electricity company will normally require a visit by a company representative at least annually in order to verify customer-supplied readings and to make a basic safety check of the meter. In an induction type meter, creep is a phenomenon that can adversely affect accuracy, that occurs when the meter disc rotates continuously with potential applied and the load terminals open circuited. A test for error due to creep is called a creep test. Two standards govern meter accuracy, ANSI C12.20 for North America and IEC 62053\\\\. = Electronic = Solid state Danish made electricity meter used in a home in the Netherlands Electronic meters display the energy used on an LCD or LED display, and some can also transmit readings to remote places. In addition to measuring energy used, electronic meters can also record other parameters of the load and supply such as instantaneous and maximum rate of usage demands, voltages, power factor and reactive power used etc. They can also support time-of-day billing, for example, recording the amount of energy used during on-peak and off-peak hours. The meter has a power supply, a metering engine, a processing and communication engine (i.e. a microcontroller), and other add-on modules such as a real time clock (RTC), a liquid crystal display, infra red communication ports/modules and so on. The metering engine is given the voltage and current inputs and has a voltage reference, samplers and quantisers followed by an analog to digital conversion section to yield the digitised equivalents of all the inputs. These inputs are then processed using a digital signal processor to calculate the various metering parameters. The largest source of long-term errors in the meter is drift in the preamp, followed by the precision of the voltage reference. Both of these vary with temperature as well, and vary wildly when meters are outdoors. Characterising and compensating for these is a major part of meter design. The processing and communication section has the responsibility of calculating the various derived quantities from the digital values generated by the metering engine. This also has the responsibility of communication using various protocols and interface with other addon modules connected as slaves to it. RTC and other add-on modules are attached as slaves to the processing and communication section for various input/output functions. On a modern meter most if not all of this will be implemented inside the microprocessor, such as the RTC, LCD controller, temperature sensor, memory and analog to digital converters. = Communication methods = Remote meter reading is a practical example of telemetry. It saves the cost of a human meter reader and the resulting mistakes, but it also allows more measurements, and remote provisioning. Many smart meters now include a switch to interrupt or restore service. Historically, rotating meters could report their metered information remotely, using a pair of electrical contacts attached to a KYZ line. A KYZ interface is a Form C contact supplied from the meter. In a KYZ interface, the Y and Z wires are switch contacts, shorted to K for a measured amount of energy. When one contact closes the other contact opens to provide count accuracy security. Each contact change of state is considered one pulse. The frequency of pulses indicates the power demand. The number of pulses indicates energy metered. The KYZ relay creates pulses. The term KYZ refers to the contact designations: K for common, Y for Normally Open, and Z for Normally Closed. When incorporated into an electrical meter, the relay changes state with each rotation (or half rotation) of the meter disc. Each state change is called a \\"pulse.\\" When connected to external equipment, rate of use (kW) as well as total usage (kWh) can be determined from the rate and quantity of pulses. KYZ outputs were historically attached to \\"totaliser relays\\" feeding a \\"totaliser\\" so that many meters could be read all at once in one place. KYZ outputs are also the classic way of attaching electricity meters to programmable logic controllers, HVACs or other control systems. Some modern meters also supply a contact closure that warns when the meter detects a demand near a higher electricity tariff, to improve demand side management. Some meters have an open collector or IR LED output that give 32-100 ms pulses for each metered amount of electrical energy, usually 1000-10000 pulses per kWh. Output is limited to max 27 V DC and 27 mA DC. These outputs usually follow the DIN 43864 standard. Often, meters designed for semi-automated reading have a serial port on that communicates by infrared LED through the faceplate of the meter. In some multi-unit buildings, a similar protocol is used, but in a wired bus using a serial current loop to connect all the meters to a single plug. The plug is often near a more easily accessible point. In the European Union, the most common infrared and protocol is \\"FLAG\\", a simplified subset of mode C of IEC 61107. In the United States and Canada, the favoured infrared protocol is ANSI C12.18. Some industrial meters use a protocol for programmable logic controllers (Modbus or DNP3). One protocol proposed for this purpose is DLMS/COSEM which can operate over any medium, including serial ports. The data can be transmitted by Zigbee, WiFi, telephone lines or over the power lines themselves. Some meters can be read over the internet. Other more modern protocols are also becoming widely used, like OSGP (Open Smart Grid Protocol). Electronic meters now use low-power radio, GSM, GPRS, Bluetooth, IrDA, as well as RS-485 wired link. The meters can now store the entire usage profiles with time stamps and relay them at a click of a button. The demand readings stored with the profiles accurately indicate the load requirements of the customer. This load profile data is processed at the utilities for billing and planning purposes. AMR (Automatic Meter Reading) and RMR (Remote Meter Reading) describe various systems that allow meters to be checked without the need to send a meter reader out. An electronic meter can transmit its readings by telephone line or radio to a central billing office. Automatic meter reading can be done with GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) modems, one is attached to each meter and the other is placed at the central utility office.  Monitoring and billing methods  = Commercial uses = Large commercial and industrial premises may use electronic meters which record power usage in blocks of half an hour or less. This is because most electricity grids have demand surges throughout the day, and the power company may wish to give price incentives to large customers to reduce demand at these times. These demand surges often correspond to meal times or, famously, to advertisements interrupting popular television programmes. = Home energy monitoring = A potentially powerful means to reduce household energy consumption is to provide convenient real- time feedback to users so they can change their energy using behaviour. Recently, low-cost energy feedback displays have become available. A study using a consumer-readable meter in 500 Ontario homes by Hydro One showed an average 6.5% drop in total electricity use when compared with a similarly sized control group. Hydro One subsequently offered free power monitors to 30,000 customers based on the success of the pilot. Projects such as Google PowerMeter, take information from a smart meter and make it more readily available to users to help encourage conservation. One model of plug-in electricity meter, used to measure consumption of an individual appliance; in this case, Christmas lights. Plug-in electricity meters (or plug load meters) measure energy used by individual appliances. There are a variety of models available on the market today but they all work on the same basic principle. The meter is plugged into an outlet, and the appliance to be measured is plugged into the meter. Such meters can help in energy conservation by identifying major energy users, or devices that consume excessive standby power. Web resources can also be used, if an estimate of the power consumption is enough for the research purposes. A power meter can often be borrowed from the local power authorities or a local public library. = Multiple tariff = Electricity retailers may wish to charge customers different tariffs at different times of the day to better reflect the costs of generation and transmission. Since it is typically not cost effective to store significant amounts of electricity during a period of low demand for use during a period of high demand, costs will vary significantly depending on the time of day. Low cost generation capacity (baseload) such as nuclear can take many hours to start, meaning a surplus in times of low demand, whereas high cost but flexible generating capacity (such as gas turbines) must be kept available to respond at a moment's notice (spinning reserve) to peak demand, perhaps being used for a few minutes per day, which is very expensive. Some multiple tariff meters use different tariffs for different amounts of demand. These are usually industrial meters. Domestic variable-rate meters generally permit two to three tariffs (\\"peak\\", \\"off-peak\\" and \\"shoulder\\") and in such installations a simple electromechanical time switch may be used. Historically, these have often been used in conjunction with electrical storage heaters or hot water storage systems. Multiple tariffs are made easier by time of use (TOU) meters which incorporate or are connected to a time switch and which have multiple registers. Switching between the tariffs may happen via ripple control, or via a radio-activated switch. In principle, a sealed time switch can also be used, but is considered more vulnerable to tampering to obtain cheaper electricity. Economy 7 Meter and Teleswitcher Radio-activated switching is common in the UK, with a nightly data signal sent within the longwave carrier of BBC Radio 4, 198 kHz. The time of off-peak charging is usually seven hours between midnight and 7:00am GMT/BST, and this is designed to power storage heaters and immersion heaters. In the UK, such tariffs are typically branded Economy 7, White Meter or Dual-Rate. The popularity of such tariffs has declined in recent years, at least in the domestic market, because of the (perceived or real) deficiencies of storage heaters and the comparatively much lower cost of natural gas per kWh (typically a factor of 3-5 times lower). Nevertheless, a sizeable number of properties do not have the option of gas, with many in rural areas being outside the gas supply network, and others being expensive upfront to upgrade to a radiator system. An Economy 10 meter is also available, which gives 10 hours of cheap off-peak electricity spread out over three timeslots throughout a 24-hour period. This allows multiple top-up boosts to storage heaters, or a good spread of times to run a wet electric heating system on a cheaper electricity rate. Most meters using Economy 7 switch the entire electricity supply to the cheaper rate during the 7 hour night time period, not just the storage heater circuit. The downside of this is that the daytime rate per kWh is significantly higher, and that standing charges are sometimes higher. For example, as of July 2017, normal (\\"single rate\\") electricity costs 17.14p per kWh in the London region on the standard default tariff for EDF Energy (the post-privatisation incumbent electricity supplier in London), with a standing charge of 18.90p per day. The equivalent Economy 7 costs are 21.34p per kWh during the peak usage period with 7.83p per kWh during the off-peak usage period, and a standing charge of 18.90p per day. Timer switches installed on washing machines, tumble dryers, dishwashers and immersion heaters may be set so that they only switch on during the off-peak usage period. = Smart meters = Smart meters go a step further than simple AMR (automatic meter reading). They offer additional functionality including a real-time or near real-time reads, power outage notification, and power quality monitoring. They allow price setting agencies to introduce different prices for consumption based on the time of day and the season. Another type of smart meter uses nonintrusive load monitoring to automatically determine the number and type of appliances in a residence, how much energy each uses and when. This meter is used by electric utilities to do surveys of energy use. It eliminates the need to put timers on all of the appliances in a house to determine how much energy each uses. = Prepayment meters = Prepayment meter and magnetic stripe tokens, from a rented accommodation in the UK. The button labelled A displays information and statistics such as current tariff and remaining credit. The button labelled B activates a small amount of emergency credit should the customer run out A prepayment key The standard business model of electricity retailing involves the electricity company billing the customer for the amount of energy used in the previous month or quarter. In some countries, if the retailer believes that the customer may not pay the bill, a prepayment meter may be installed. This requires the customer to make advance payment before electricity can be used. If the available credit is exhausted then the supply of electricity is cut off by a relay. In the UK, mechanical prepayment meters used to be common in rented accommodation. Disadvantages of these included the need for regular visits to remove cash, and risk of theft of the cash in the meter. Modern solid-state electricity meters, in conjunction with smart cards, have removed these disadvantages and such meters are commonly used for customers considered to be a poor credit risk. In the UK, customers can use organisations such as the Post Office Ltd or PayPoint network, where rechargeable tokens (Quantum cards for natural gas, or plastic \\"keys\\" for electricity) can be loaded with whatever money the customer has available. In South Africa, Sudan and Northern Ireland prepaid meters are recharged by entering a unique, encoded twenty digit number using a keypad. This makes the tokens, essentially a slip of paper, very cheap to produce. Around the world, experiments are going on, especially in developing countries, to test pre-payment systems. In some cases, prepayment meters have not been accepted by customers. There are various groups, such as the Standard Transfer Specification (STS) association, which promote common standards for prepayment metering systems across manufacturers. Prepaid meters using the STS standard are used in many countries. = Time of day metering = Time of Day metering (TOD), also known as Time of Usage (TOU) or Seasonal Time of Day (SToD), metering involves dividing the day, month and year into tariff slots and with higher rates at peak load periods and low tariff rates at off-peak load periods. While this can be used to automatically control usage on the part of the customer (resulting in automatic load control), it is often simply the customer's responsibility to control his own usage or pay accordingly (voluntary load control). This also allows the utilities to plan their transmission infrastructure appropriately. See also Demand-side Management (DSM). TOD metering normally splits rates into an arrangement of multiple segments including on-peak, off-peak, mid-peak or shoulder, and critical peak. A typical arrangement is a peak occurring during the day (non-holiday days only), such as from 1 pm to 9 pm Monday through Friday during the summer and from 6:30 am to 12 noon and 5 pm to 9 pm during the winter. More complex arrangements include the use of critical peaks that occur during high demand periods. The times of peak demand/cost will vary in different markets around the world. Large commercial users can purchase power by the hour using either forecast pricing or real-time pricing. Some utilities allow residential customers to pay hourly rates, such as in Illinois, which uses day ahead pricing. = Power export metering = Many electricity customers are installing their own electricity generating equipment, whether for reasons of economy, redundancy or environmental reasons. When a customer is generating more electricity than required for his own use, the surplus may be exported back to the power grid. Customers that generate back into the \\"grid\\" usually must have special equipment and safety devices to protect the grid components (as well as the customer's own) in case of faults (electrical short circuits) or maintenance of the grid (say voltage on a downed line coming from an exporting customers facility). This exported energy may be accounted for in the simplest case by the meter running backwards during periods of net export, thus reducing the customer's recorded energy usage by the amount exported. This in effect results in the customer being paid for his/her exports at the full retail price of electricity. Unless equipped with a ratchet or equivalent, a standard meter will accurately record power flow in each direction by simply running backwards when power is exported. Where allowed by law, utilities maintain a profitable margin between the price of energy delivered to the consumer and the rate credited for consumer-generated energy that flows back to the grid. Lately, upload sources typically originate from renewable sources (e.g., wind turbines, photovoltaic cells), or gas or steam turbines, which are often found in cogeneration systems. Another potential upload source that has been proposed is plug-in hybrid car batteries (vehicle- to-grid power systems). This requires a \\"smart grid,\\" which includes meters that measure electricity via communication networks that require remote control and give customers timing and pricing options. Vehicle-to-grid systems could be installed at workplace parking lots and garages and at park and rides and could help drivers charge their batteries at home at night when off-peak power prices are cheaper, and receive bill crediting for selling excess electricity back to the grid during high-demand hours.  Location  Current transformers used as part of metering equipment for three-phase 400 A electricity supply. The fourth neutral wire does not require a current transformer because current cannot flow in the neutral without also flowing in metered phase wires. (Blondel's theorem) A commercial power meter Electricity meters placed outside the homes of residents in a common place, which is accessible only for the department staff and concerned residents A Duke Energy technician removes the tamper-proof seal from an electricity meter at a residence in Durham, North Carolina The location of an electricity meter varies with each installation. Possible locations include on a utility pole serving the property, in a street-side cabinet (meter box) or inside the premises adjacent to the consumer unit / distribution board. Electricity companies may prefer external locations as the meter can be read without gaining access to the premises but external meters may be more prone to vandalism. Current transformers permit the meter to be located remotely from the current-carrying conductors. This is common in large installations. For example, a substation serving a single large customer may have metering equipment installed in a cabinet, without bringing heavy cables into the cabinet. = Customer drop and metering equation = Since electrical standards vary in different regions, \\"customer drops\\" from the grid to the customer also vary depending on the standards and the type of installation. There are several common types of connections between a grid and a customer. Each type has a different metering equation. Blondel's theorem states that for any system with N current-carrying conductors, that N-1 measuring elements are sufficient to measure electrical energy. This indicates that different metering is needed, for example, for a three-phase three-wire system than for a three-phase four-wire (with neutral) system. In Europe, Asia, Africa and most other locations, single phase is common for residential and small commercial customers. Single phase distribution is less-expensive, because one set of transformers in a substation normally serve a large area with relatively high voltages (usually 230 V) and no local transformers. These have a simple metering equation: Watts = volts x amps, with volts measured from the neutral to the phase wire. In the United States, Canada, and parts of Central and South America similar customers are normally served by three-wire single phase. Three-wire single-phase requires local transformers, as few as one per ten residences, but provides lower, safer voltages at the socket (usually 120 V), and provides two voltages to customers: neutral to phase (usually 120 V), and phase to phase (usually 240 V). Additionally, three-wire customers normally have neutral wired to the zero side of the generator's windings, which gives earthing that can be easily measured to be safe. These meters have a metering equation of Watts = 0.5 x volts x (amps of phase A ‚àí amps of phase B), with volts measured between the phase wires. Industrial power is normally supplied as three phase power. There are two forms: three wire, or four wire with a system neutral. In \\"three wire\\" or \\"three wire delta,\\" , there is no neutral but an earth ground is the safety ground. The three phases have voltage only relative to each other. This distribution method has one fewer wire, is less expensive, and is common in Asia, Africa, and many parts of Europe. In regions that mix residences and light industry, it is common for this to be the only distribution method. A meter for this type normally measures two of the windings relative to the third winding, and adds the watts. One disadvantage of this system is that if the safety earth fails, it is difficult to discover this by direct measurement, because no phase has a voltage relative to earth. In the four-wire three-phase system, sometimes called \\"four-wire wye\\", the safety ground is connected to a neutral wire that is physically connected to the zero-voltage side of the three windings of the generator or transformer. Since all power phases are relative to the neutral in this system, if the neutral is disconnected, it can be directly measured. In the United States, the National Electrical Code requires neutrals to be of this type.See the National Electrical Code, a large book, revised yearly, widely available for purchase. In this system, power meters measure and sum all three phases relative to the neutral. In North America, it is common for electricity meters to plug into a standardised socket outdoors, on the side of a building. This allows the meter to be replaced without disturbing the wires to the socket, or the occupant of the building. Some sockets may have a bypass while the meter is removed for service. The amount of electricity used without being recorded during this small time is considered insignificant when compared to the inconvenience which might be caused to the customer by cutting off the electricity supply. Most electronic meters in North America use a serial protocol, ANSI C12.18. In many other countries the supply and load terminals are in the meter housing itself. Cables are connected directly to the meter. In some areas the meter is outside, often on a utility pole. In others, it is inside the building in a niche. If inside, it may share a data connection with other meters. If it exists, the shared connection is often a small plug near the post box. The connection is often EIA-485 or infra-red with a serial protocol such as IEC 62056. In 2014, networking to meters is rapidly changing. The most common schemes seem to combine an existing national standard for data (e.g. ANSI C12.19 or IEC 62056) operating via the internet protocol with a small circuit board for powerline communication, or a digital radio for a mobile phone network, or an ISM band.  Accuracy  Electricity meters are required to register the energy consumed within an acceptable degree of accuracy. Any significant error in the registered energy can represent a loss to the electricity supplier, or the consumer being over billed. The accuracy is generally laid down in statute for the location in which the meter is installed. Statutory provisions may also specify a procedure to be followed should the accuracy be disputed. For the United Kingdom, any installed electricity meter is required to accurately record the consumed energy, but it is permitted to under-read by 3.5%, or over-read by 2.5%.Measuring Instruments (Active Electrical Energy Meters) regulations 2006, Schedule 1, Paragraph 15. These errors apply between +5¬∞C to +30¬∞C and a power factor of 0.8 leading to 0.5 lagging. Outside of these limits larger errors are permissible. Disputed meters are initially verified with a check meter operating alongside the disputed meter. The final resort is for the disputed meter to be fully tested both in the installed location and at a specialist calibration laboratory.Electricity meter accuracy disputes Approximately 93% of disputed meters are found to be operating satisfactorily. A refund of electricity paid for, but not consumed (but not vice versa) will only be made if the laboratory is able to estimate how long the meter has been misregistering. This contrasts with gas meters where if a meter is found to be under reading, it is assumed that it has under read for as long as the consumer has had a gas supply through it.the Gas (Meters) Regulations 1983  Tampering and security  Meters can be manipulated to make them under- register, effectively allowing power use without paying for it. This theft or fraud can be dangerous as well as dishonest. Power companies often install remote-reporting meters specifically to enable remote detection of tampering, and specifically to discover energy theft. The change to smart power meters is useful to stop energy theft. When tampering is detected, the normal tactic, legal in most areas of the United States, is to switch the subscriber to a \\"tampering\\" tariff charged at the meter's maximum designed current. At US$0.095/kWh, a standard residential 50 A meter causes a legally collectible charge of about US$5,000.00 per month. Meter readers are trained to spot signs of tampering, and with crude mechanical meters, the maximum rate may be charged each billing period until the tamper is removed, or the service is disconnected. A common method of tampering on mechanical disk meters is to attach magnets to the outside of the meter. Strong magnets saturate the magnetic fields in the meter so that the motor portion of a mechanical meter does not operate. Lower power magnets can add to the drag resistance of the internal disk resistance magnets. Magnets can also saturate current transformers or power-supply transformers in electronic meters, though countermeasures are common. Some combinations of capacitive and inductive load can interact with the coils and mass of a rotor and cause reduced or reverse motion. All of these effects can be detected by the electric company, and many modern meters can detect or compensate for them. The owner of the meter normally secures the meter against tampering. Revenue meters' mechanisms and connections are sealed. Meters may also measure VAR-hours (the reflected load), neutral and DC currents (elevated by most electrical tampering), ambient magnetic fields, etc. Even simple mechanical meters can have mechanical flags that are dropped by magnetic tampering or large DC currents. Newer computerised meters usually have counter-measures against tampering. AMR (Automated Meter Reading) meters often have sensors that can report opening of the meter cover, magnetic anomalies, extra clock setting, glued buttons, inverted installation, reversed or switched phases etc. Some tampers bypass the meter, wholly or in part. Safe tampers of this type normally increase the neutral current at the meter. Most split-phase residential meters in the United States are unable to detect neutral currents. However, modern tamper- resistant meters can detect and bill it at standard rates.Teridian Semiconductors Application Note, \\"Antitamper Features Enabled by the 71M6511\\" The 71M6511 is a single chip metering device widely used in computerised meters. Disconnecting a meter's neutral connector is unsafe because shorts can then pass through people or equipment rather than a metallic ground to the generator or earth. A phantom loop connection via an earth ground is often much higher resistance than the metallic neutral connector. Even if an earth ground is safe, metering at the substation can alert the operator to tampering. Substations, inter-ties, and transformers normally have a high- accuracy meter for the area served. Power companies normally investigate discrepancies between the total billed and the total generated, in order to find and fix power distribution problems. These investigations are an effective method to discover tampering. Power thefts in the United States are often connected with indoor marijuana grow operations. Narcotics detectives associate abnormally high power usage with the lighting such operations require. Indoor marijuana growers aware of this are particularly motivated to steal electricity simply to conceal their usage of it.  Regulation and legislation  Following the deregulation of electricity supply markets in many countries, the company responsible for an electricity meter may not be obvious. Depending on the arrangements in place, the meter may be the property of the meter Operator, electricity distributor, the retailer or for some large users of electricity the meter may belong to the customer. The company responsible for reading the meter may not always be the company which owns it. Meter reading is now sometimes subcontracted and in some areas the same person may read gas, water and electricity meters at the same time. The introduction of advanced meters in residential areas has produced additional privacy issues that may affect ordinary customers. These meters are often capable of recording energy usage every 15, 30 or 60 minutes. Some meters have one or two IR LEDs on the front: one used for testing and which acts as the equivalent of the timing mark on the older mechanical meters and the other as part of a two- way IR communications port for reading / programming the meter. These IR LEDs are visible with some night vision viewers and certain video cameras that are capable of sensing IR transmissions. These can be used for surveillance, revealing information about peoples' possessions and behaviour. For instance, it can show when the customer is away for extended periods. Nonintrusive load monitoring gives even more detail about what appliances people have and their living and use patterns. A more detailed and recent analysis of this issue was performed by the Illinois Security Lab.

Retrieved 7 October 2013. By the time of the Byzantine Empire it was, although in a much larger form, part of the state costume of the emperor and high officials. It survived as such until at least the 12th century AD. The ephaptis (Ancient Greek: ·ºêœÜŒ±œÄœÑŒØœÇ) was a similar garment, typically worn by infantrymen.  Ancient Greece  The chlamys was made from a seamless rectangle of woolen material about the size of a blanket, usually bordered. It was normally pinned with a fibula at the right shoulder. Originally it was wrapped around the waist like a loincloth, but by the end of the 5th century BC it was worn over the elbows. It could be worn over another item of clothing but was often the sole item of clothing for young soldiers and messengers, at least in Greek art. As such, the chlamys is the characteristic garment of Hermes (Roman Mercury), the messenger god usually depicted as a young man. The chlamys was typical Greek military attire from the 5th to the 3rd century BC. As worn by soldiers, it could be wrapped around the arm and used as a light shield in combat.  Byzantine period  King David in the Paris Psalter, 10th century AD The chlamys continued into the Byzantine period, when it was often much larger and usually worn sideways, at least by emperors, and likely made of silk. It was held on with a fibula brooch at the wearer's right shoulder and nearly reached the ground at front and back. With the even grander loros costume, the \\"chlamys costume\\" was the ceremonial wear of Byzantine emperors, and the only option for high officials on very formal occasions.Parani, 11-18 It is generally less common in surviving imperial portraits than the loros shown on coins, though the large numbers of Byzantine coins that survive provide many examples, with the fibula often the main indication in bust- length depictions. At the two edges of the cloak were large panels in a contrasting colour called tablia (sing. tablion), beginning about level with the armpit and reaching down to about the waist; typically only the one on the wearer's left is seen in portraits. The emperor alone could wear a purple chlamys with gold tablia; officials sometimes wore white with purple tablia, as the two beside Justinian I at Ravenna do.Parani, 12 In the miniature shown below the 11th-century emperor wears his open to the side, presumably to allow access to his sword, but the three officials have the opening at the centre of their bodies. By the Middle Byzantine period all parts of the chlamys were highly decorative, with bright patterned Byzantine silk and tablia and borders heavily embroidered and encrusted with gems.Parani, 12-13 In the 12th century it seems to have begun to fall from favour, although it continued to be shown on coins until the 14th century, which was perhaps long after it was actually worn. Some high officials seem to have continued to wear a version of it long after the emperors had abandoned it.Parani, 13-16 While the loros tended to represent the emperor in his religious role, the chlamys represented his secular functions as head of state, head of the administrative corps of the empire, and giver of justice.Parani, 16-18 Among women only the empress is recorded as wearing a chlamys; she was presented with it during the coronation ceremony. In art it is much rarer to see an empress in it than in a loros, but in the well-known ivory Romanos ivory (BnF, Paris) Eudokia Makrembolitissa wears one while her husband Constantine X Doukas (r. 1059‚Äì1067) wears the loros.Parani, 12, 17-18  Gallery  File:Chlamys-clad figure Louvre Ma305 n2.jpg  A chlamys-wearing torso, possibly of Alexander File:HermesPtolemy.jpg  Ptolemy III as Hermes wearing the chlamys File:Bronze youth chlamys Sous- Parsat CdM Paris.jpg  Chlamys-wearing youth (Roman, 2nd century AD) File:Chlamys.JPG  Model wearing a 19th-century re-creation File:SanVitale19.jpg  Justinian I and ministers wear early Byzantine ceremonial chlamydes, Ravenna mosaic.

The university has three campuses: one in the capital city Gaborone, one in Francistown, and another in Maun. The university is divided into six faculties: Business, Education, Engineering, Humanities, Science and Social Sciences and the University of Botswana School of Medicine, a collaboration with the University of Melbourne in Australia.http://uninews.unimelb.edu.au/articleid_1252.html accessed 2008-09-18 History Aerial View of University Of Botswana(Botswana History) UB began as a part of a larger university system known as UBBS, or the University of Bechuanaland (Botswana), Basotoland (Lesotho), and Swaziland; which was founded in 1964 to reduce the three countries' reliance on tertiary education in apartheid-era South Africa. After Botswana and Lesotho became independent in 1966, the university was called the University of Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland (UBLS). In 1975 Lesotho withdrew from the partnership and established its own national university. For several years a joint University of Botswana and Swaziland existed until in the early 1980s the university was amicably divided into two separate national universities. It was at the time of Lesotho's initial withdrawal that Botswana, which was among the poorest nations in the world, started the One Man, One Beast (motho le motho kgomo) movement. This fundraising campaign formally known as the Botswana University Campus Appeal (BUCA) was spearheaded by the late President Sir Seretse Khama in 1976. The campaign was launched to raise money for the construction of the Botswana Campus of the University of Botswana and Swaziland. BUCA followed in the wake of a unilateral nationalisation of a joint-university campus facility in Roma by the Lesotho government. Batswana (People of Botswana) and other stakeholders made contributions of all types (including cash, cattle, grain, eggs, etc.) towards accomplishing the set target of one million rand. By 1982, the University of Botswana became a reality and remains the oldest institution of higher education in the country. The One Man, One Beast (motho le motho kgomo) movement endures today on the university's main statue located in front of the new library. Administration UB Library The President or Vice President of Botswana serves as the Chancellor of the University. The top administrator on campus is the Vice Chancellor. There have been five Vice Chancellors of the university: *1982‚Äì1984: Prof. John Turner, *1984‚Äì1998: Prof. Thomas Tlou, *1998‚Äì2003: Prof. Sharon Siverts, *2003‚Äì2011: Prof. Bojosi Otlhogile, *2011‚Äì2017: Prof. Thabo Fako. *2017‚Äìpresent: Prof. David Norris * Student life Many students live on campus in residence halls. Students that live in the residence halls are served meals in campus refectories. Campus amenities, include an Olympic- sized swimming pool, an entertainment arena, and sports courts (basketball, tennis, handball, netball, volleyball). The university is adjacent to the National Stadium, which is available for university use. The practice fields outside the stadium are the location for university intramural sports. The university provides a free medical clinic and counseling services.  Library system  The university library has been in existence since 1971 when the first thousand volumes were housed in an unused church building in the village of Gaborone. The first official building was opened in 1986, which was two stories tall and contained only five computers. In 2001, the library moved to a new building, more than tripling its size. The new main library is one of the largest university libraries in Africa with five floors.  Faculty of Business  University of Botswana Faculty of Business The Faculty of Business was established in 1997 following the reorganisation of the School of Accounting and Management Studies under the Faculty of Social Sciences. Under the umbrella of this new faculty, three departments were created to offer specialism in management, marketing, and accounting and finance. The most popular of these is the Bachelor of Accountancy (BAcc) program, which trains students for a professional level accounting certification exams, most notably the ACCA. Many graduates have integrated this degree into tracks such as becoming American CPA's or members of the UK's CIMA. The faculty offers five degrees: * Bachelor of Accountancy (BAcc) * Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) in Management * Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) in Marketing * Bachelor of Information Systems (BIS) * Bachelor of Finance * Master of Business Administration (MBA)  Faculty of Education  This is the oldest faculty in the university. The faculty is composed of eight departments including Lifelong Learning and Community Development, Educational Foundations, Educational Technology, Family and Consumer Sciences, Languages and Social Sciences, Mathematics and Sciences Education, Primary Education and Sports Science. There are fifteen undergraduate programmes: a Master of Education degree with eleven specialisations; a Master of Masters in Lifelong Learning and Community Development program, a Master of Counselling and Human Services programme, two MPhil and Ph.D. programmes and a Post Graduate Diploma in Education. The new semester schedule has resulted in the discontinuation of the certificate in Adult Education and Diploma in Home Economics, Physical Education and Science Education programs. New programmes have been introduced including the Bachelor of Educational Management. Changes in structure of the faculty are expected during the Botswana government's National Development Plan 9, with some departments being incorporated in the envisaged Faculty of Health Sciences. The academic staff complement stands at 124, making the staff/student ratio 1:14.  Faculty of Engineering  The Faculty of Engineering and Technology was created in 1996 as a result of Botswana Polytechnic being incorporated into UB. The faculty was located approximately from the main UB campus in downtown Gaborone where it is now known as BCET, but it has since been moved to the main campus. The Faculty provides a wide range of Engineering courses including Mechanical, Civil, Electrical, Mining and Mineral Engineering, Industrial Design and Technology. Other courses such as Architecture, Real Estate, Planning Survey are also offered. It offers Certificate, Diploma, Bachelors and Masters in areas related to Engineering. and the planning courses which takes five years (four years in Botswana and the last year to complete with masters at professional planning institutions).  Faculty of Science  The Faculty of Science, which has the largest annual enrollment, began as the School of Science of UBBS in 1971. Its original four departments (Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics) were involved only in teaching Part I of the BSc degree programme. In 1975, when the Lesotho campus dissociated from UBBS, the teaching of Part II (years 3 and 4) began in all departments. The departments of environmental science, geology, and computer science were added to the faculty before the University of Botswana came into existence in 1982. University of Botswana Earth Science The head of the Environmental Science department, Dr. Segosebe, is also the Chair of Somarelang Tikologo, a local environmental NGO in Gaborone.  Faculty of Social Science  A number of programmes at the certificate, diploma, degree, and masters levels are offered by the Faculty of Social Sciences. Students admitted into the BA programme are allowed, with the permission of the heads of department, to pursue a combined major in two subjects from departments within the faculty as well as selected departments in other faculties. Degree programmes offered in the faculty include Bachelor of Law, Bachelor of Social Sciences, Bachelor of Social Work, and Master of Public Administration, as well as Bachelor of Arts in Criminal Justice Studies.  School of Medicine  The Bachelor of Medicine Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) professional degree is a five-year programme. The first two years follow an integrated Problem Based Learning approach. The last three years are clinically structured providing the opportunity to practice in the hospital and community. A modern building complex, erected on the main university campus to house the medical school was completed in 2012. A 450-bed academic teaching hospital was completed in 2014. On average, a total of 50 medical undergraduates are admitted to the MBBS programme annually.

Situated in the southern dock system, it was connected to Toxteth Dock to the north and Herculaneum Dock to the south. History The first dock on the site was known as Egerton Dock, named after the Dukes of Bridgewater, built between 1837-9. The first dock was small, with a -wide entrance, and intended for river and canal boats moving timber. In 1839, Jesse Hartley and his son were employed by a separate private company to design two further small basins on the site, known as Harrington Dock and Harrington Dry Basin. The name of the dock can be traced to the district of Harrington, intended for a planned overflow town for Liverpool which never came to fruition. The district of Harrington, itself, was named in honour of Lady Isabella Stanhope, daughter of William Stanhope, 2nd Earl of Harrington and wife of Charles Molyneux, 1st Earl of Sefton who owned the former Royal Forest of Toxteth Park. The dock was bought and opened in 1844, although not commercially successful. By 1858, the dock primarily traded with the west coast of South America. The land was eventually acquired by the Liverpool Dock Trust. Harrington Dock was enlarged by George Fosbery Lyster between 1875-83 and the new Harrington Dock was opened in 1882. A tunnel from the Garston and Liverpool Railway emerged at the dock, and the second Herculaneum Dock railway station of the Liverpool Overhead Railway was adjacent to the dock from 1896. The dock was further improved in 1898, by widening the entrances and deepening the dock. Harrington Dock was used by the Elder Dempster Lines and its associated businesses. The dock closed in 1972 and has since been filled in. Most of the dock buildings still exist and are divided into small business units as part of Brunswick Business Park.

This phase spans from the end of the Battle of Normandy, or Operation Overlord, (25 August 1944) incorporating the German winter counter-offensive through the Ardennes (commonly known as the Battle of the Bulge) and Operation Nordwind (in Alsace and Lorraine) up to the Allies preparing to cross the Rhine in the early months of 1945. This roughly corresponds with the official United States military European Theater of Operations Rhineland and Ardennes-Alsace campaigns. Background Sherman tanks and infantrymen of the U.S. 4th Armored Division advancing through Coutances. German forces had been routed during the Allied break-out from Normandy. The Allies advanced rapidly against an enemy that put up little resistance. But after the liberation of Paris in late August 1944, the Allies paused to re-group and organise before continuing their advance from Paris to the River Rhine. The pause allowed the Germans to solidify their lines‚Äîsomething they had been unable to do west of Paris. By the middle of September 1944, the three Western Allied army groups; the Anglo- Canadian 21st Army Group (Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery) in the north, the United States U.S. 12th Army Group (Lieutenant General Omar Bradley) in the center, and the Franco-American 6th Army Group (Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers) in the south, formed a broad front under the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower and his headquarters SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force). While Montgomery and Bradley each favored relatively direct thrusts into Germany (with Montgomery and Bradley each offering to be the spearhead of such an assault), General Eisenhower disagreed. Instead, he chose a \\"broad-front\\" strategy, which allowed the Allies to gain ground from the beaten Germans in all sectors, allowed the advancing Allied forces to support each other, and minimized the difficulty of supplying the most advanced forces. The rapid advance through France had caused considerable logistical strain, made worse by the lack of any major port other than the relatively distant Cherbourg in western France. Although Antwerp was seen as the key to solving the Allied logistics problems, its port was not open to Allied shipping until the Scheldt estuary was clear of German forces. As the campaign progressed, all the belligerents, Allied as well as German, felt the effects of the lack of suitable replacements for front-line troops. There were two major defensive obstacles to the Allies. The first was the natural barriers made by the rivers of eastern France. The second was the Siegfried Line, which fell under the command, along with all Wehrmacht forces in the west, of Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt. =Logistics and supply= Although the breakout from Normandy had taken longer than planned, the advances until September had far exceeded expectations. Bradley, for example, by September had four more divisions than planned and all of his forces were ahead of their expected position. One effect was that insufficient supplies could be delivered to the various fronts to maintain the advance: demand had exceeded the expected needs. Mulberry 'A' off Omaha Beach was critical in the early days for Allied supplies. Much war material still had to be brought ashore across the invasion beaches and through the one remaining Mulberry harbour (the other had been destroyed in an English Channel storm). Although small harbours, such as Isigny, Port-en-Bessin, and Courcelles, were being used, the major forward ports such as Calais, Boulogne, Dunkirk and Le Havre either remained in German hands as \\"fortresses\\" or had been systematically destroyed. The availability of Cherbourg had been valuable until the breakout, but then the shortage of transport to carry supplies to the rapidly advancing armies became the limiting factor. Although fuel was successfully pumped from Britain to Normandy via the Pluto pipeline, this still had to reach the fronts, which were advancing faster than the pipelines could be extended.Ruppenthal, Logistic Support of the Armies, Vol. I, pp. 501-502 The railways had been largely destroyed by Allied attacks and would take much effort to repair, so fleets of trucks were needed in the interim.Ruppenthal, Logistic Support of the Armies, Vol. I, pp. 547-51 In an attempt to address this acute shortage of transport, three newly arrived U.S. infantry divisions‚Äîthe 26th, 95th, and 104th‚Äîwere stripped of their trucks in order to haul supplies.Ruppenthal, Logistic Support of the Armies, Vol. II, p. 170 Advancing divisions of the U.S. 12th Army Group left all their heavy artillery and half their medium artillery west of the Seine, freeing their trucks to move supplies for other units.Ruppenthal, Logistic Support of the Armies, Vol. I, p. 487 Four British truck companies were loaned to the Americans.Ruppenthal, Logistic Support of the Armies, Vol. I, p. 484 Unfortunately, 1,500 other British trucks were found to have critical engine faults and were unusable, limiting assistance from that quarter.Administrative History of the Operations of 21 Army Group, p. 47 The Red Ball Express was an attempt to expedite deliveries by truck but capacity was inadequate for the circumstances.Ruppenthal, Logistic Support of the Armies, Vol. I, pp. 520 The 6th Army Group advancing from southern France were supplied adequately from Toulon and Marseille because it had captured ports intact and the local railway system was less damaged. This source supplied about 25% of the Allied needs. At this time the main Allied supply lines still ran back to Normandy, presenting serious logistical problems. The solution was to open the port of Antwerp. This major port had been captured at 90% intact on 4 September, but the occupation of Antwerp was not enough as the 21st Army Group failed to gain sea access by clearing the Scheldt estuary. So the port could not be used until 29 November after a protracted campaign by the Canadian First Army; initially the estuary was weakly held, but the German 15th Army was allowed to dig in there. The delay in securing this area has been blamed on General Eisenhower as the 21st Army Group commander, Field Marshal Montgomery favored Operation Market-Garden and opening the French Channel ports over clearing the approaches to the port of Antwerp in the Battle of the Scheldt. =Manpower= The German armies had lost large numbers of troops in Normandy and the subsequent pursuit. To counteract this, about 20,000 Luftwaffe personnel were reallocated to the German Army, invalided troops were redrafted into the front line and Volkssturm units were formed using barely trained civilians. British manpower resources were limited after five years of war and through worldwide commitments. Replacements were no longer adequate to cover losses and some formations were disbanded to maintain the strength of others. The Canadians were also short of manpower, due to a reluctance to require conscripts to serve outside Canada or Canadian waters. This had arisen from internal Canadian political difficulties during World War I and there had been a wide consensus against conscription for overseas service. American losses now called on replacements direct from the United States. They were often inexperienced and not used to the harsh conditions of the latter part of the campaign. There were also complaints about the poor quality of troops released into the infantry from less-stressed parts of the U.S. Army. At one point, after the Battle of the Bulge had highlighted the shortage of infantrymen, the army relaxed its embargo on the use of black soldiers in combat formations. Black volunteers performed well and prompted a permanent change in military policy. By the beginning of the next year, the war's outcome was clear. It became increasingly difficult to persuade Allied troops to risk their lives when peace was in sight. No one wished to be the last man killed. Northern Group of Armies (21st Army Group) =Channel ports= Hampshire Regiment crossing the Seine at Vernon, 28 August 1944. The Channel ports were urgently needed to maintain the Allied armies. By the time that Brussels was liberated, it had become difficult to supply the 21st Army Group adequately. Indeed, one corps‚ÄîVIII Corps‚Äîwas withdrawn from active service to free its transport for general use. The Canadian First Army was tasked with liberating the ports during its advance along the French coast. The ports involved were Le Havre, Dieppe, Boulogne, Calais, and Dunkirk in France, as well as Ostend in Belgium. Adolf Hitler had appreciated their strategic value. He issued a F√ºhrer Order declaring them to be \\"fortresses\\" that must receive adequate materiel for a siege and be held to the last man. Dieppe was evacuated by the Germans before Hitler's order had been received and, consequently, the Canadians took it with little trouble and with the port installations largely intact. Ostend had been omitted from the F√ºhrer Order and was also undefended, although demolitions delayed its use. The other ports were defended to varying degrees, however, and they required substantial work to bring them into use, except for Dunkirk which was sealed off to the rear of the Allied advance. British vehicles enter Brussels on 4 September 1944 =Market Garden= The first operation of the Rhineland campaign, Market Garden, was commanded by Montgomery and was to secure a bridgehead over the Rhine in the north, at Arnhem, which would outflank the Siegfried Line. Market Garden had two distinct parts. Market was to be the largest airborne operation in history, dropping three and a half divisions of American, British, and Polish paratroopers to capture key bridges and prevent their demolition by the Germans. Garden was a ground attack by the British Second Army across the bridges. It was assumed that the German forces would still be recovering from the previous campaign and opposition would not be very stiff for either operation. If successful, the Allies would have a direct route into Germany that bypassed the main German defenses and also seize territory from which the Germans launched V-1s and V-2s against London, Antwerp and elsewhere. General Eisenhower approved Market Garden. He gave supply priority to the 21st Army Group and diverted the U.S. First Army to the north of the Ardennes to stage limited attacks to draw German defenders south, away from the target sites. American paratroopers receive a final briefing from their commanding officer before emplaning, 17 September 1944 The operation was launched on 17 September. At first, it went well. The U.S. 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions took their objectives at Eindhoven, Veghel and Nijmegen. Although their landings outside Arnhem were on target, the British 1st Airborne Division landing zones were some distance from Arnhem bridge and only on the north side of the river. Problems arose when the British 1st Airborne Division lost vital equipment‚Äîjeeps and heavy anti-tank guns‚Äîwhen gliders crashed. There had also been a severe underestimation of German strength in the area. To make matters worse, poor weather prevented aerial reinforcements and drastically reduced resupply. German resistance to the forces driving to Arnhem was highly effective, and a copy of the Allied battle plan had been captured. In the end, Market Garden was unsuccessful. Arnhem bridge was not held and the British paratroops suffered tremendous casualties‚Äîapproximately 77% by 25 September. =Battle of the Scheldt= The logistics situation was becoming critical, so opening the Port of Antwerp was now a high priority. On 12 September 1944, the Canadian First Army was given the task of clearing the Scheldt of German forces. The 1st Army comprised the II Canadian Corps, which included the Polish 1st Armoured Division, the British 49th and 52nd Divisions and the British I Corps. The task involved four main operations: The first was to clear the area north of Antwerp and secure access to South Beveland. The second was to clear the Breskens pocket north of the Leopold Canal (Operation Switchback). The third‚ÄîOperation Vitality‚Äîwas the capture of South Beveland. The final phase was the capture of Walcheren Island, which had been fortified into a powerful German stronghold. On 21 September 1944, the advance began. The 4th Canadian Armoured Division, moving north toward the south shore of the Scheldt around the Dutch town of Breskens, were the first Allied troops to face the formidable obstacle of the double line of the Leopold and D√©rivation de la Lys Canals. The canals were crossed and a bridgehead established, but fierce counter-attacks by the Germans forced them to withdraw with heavy casualties. The 1st Polish Armoured Division had greater success, moving northeast to the coast, occupying Terneuzen and clearing the south bank of the Scheldt eastward to Antwerp. It was by then clear, however, that any further advances would be at tremendous cost. Flushing with shells bursting ahead during the Scheldt operation. The 2nd Canadian Infantry Division began its advance north from Antwerp on 2 October. Heavy casualties ensued, including the almost total destruction of the 5th Canadian Infantry Brigade's Black Watch Battalion on 13 October. However, on 16 October Woensdrecht was taken, following an immense artillery barrage which forced the Germans back. This cut South Beveland and Walcheren off from the mainland and achieved the objective of the first operation. Montgomery issued a directive that made the opening of the Scheldt estuary the top priority. To the east, the British Second Army attacked westward to clear the Netherlands south of the Maas River. This helped secure the Scheldt region from counter-attack. In Operation Switchback, the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division mounted a two-pronged attack, with the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade crossing the Leopold Canal and the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade launching an amphibious assault from the coastal side of the pocket. Despite fierce resistance from the Germans, the 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade crossed the Leopold Canal and the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade moved southwards, opening a supply route into the pocket. Operation Vitality‚Äîthe third major phase of the Battle of the Scheldt‚Äîbegan on 24 October. The 2nd Canadian Infantry Division began its advance toward South Beveland, but was slowed by mines, mud and strong enemy defences. The British 52nd Division made an amphibious attack to get in behind the Germans' Beveland Canal defensive positions. Thus, this formidable defence was outflanked, and the 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade began a frontal attack in assault boats. The engineers were able to bridge the canal on the main road. With the canal line gone, the German defence crumbled and South Beveland was cleared. The third phase of the Battle of the Scheldt was now complete. The final phase, Operation Infatuate was the attack on the heavily fortified island of Walcheren at the mouth of the West Scheldt. The island's dykes were breached by attacks from RAF Bomber Command on 3, 7, and 11 October. This flooded the central part of the island, forcing the German defenders onto the high ground and allowing the use of amphibious vehicles. Units of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division attacked the causeway on 31 October, and after a grim struggle, established a precarious foothold. They were relieved by a battalion of the British 52nd Division. In conjunction with the waterborne attacks, the 52nd continued the advance. German prisoners on Walcheren ‚Äì around 40,000 were taken after the Operation Infatuate had terminated The amphibious landings began on 1 November with units of the British 155th Infantry Brigade landing on a beach in the south- eastern area of Vlissingen. During the next few days, they engaged in heavy street fighting against the German defenders. Also on 1 November, after a heavy naval bombardment by the British Royal Navy, troops of 4th Commando Brigade, (with units of 10th Inter Allied Commando, consisting mainly of Belgian and Norwegian troops), supported by specialised armoured vehicles of the British 79th Armoured Division were landed on both sides of the gap in the sea dyke. Heavy fighting ensued. A smaller force moved south-eastward, toward Vlissingen, while the main force went northeast to clear the northern half of Walcheren to link up with the Canadians who had established a bridgehead on the eastern part of the island. Fierce resistance was again offered by German troops defending the area, and fighting continued until 7 November. However, the action ended on 8 November after a force of amphibious vehicles entered Middelburg, the capital of Walcheren. Meanwhile, Operation Pheasant was launched in on October 20 which was intended as a major operation to clear German troops from the Province of North Brabant in conjunction with the battle of the Scheldt. The offensive after some resistance liberated most of region; the cities of Tilburg, s-Hertogenbosch, Willemstad and Roosendaal were liberated by British forces. Bergen Op Zoom was taken by the Canadians and the Polish 1st Armoured Division led by General Maczek liberated the city of Breda. As a result, the German positions which had defended the region along its canals and rivers had been broken. The operation was also a success in that civilian casualties relatively light. Meanwhile, the 4th Canadian Armoured Division had pushed eastwards past Bergen-op-Zoom to Sint Philipsland where it sank several German vessels in Zijpe harbour. With the approaches to Antwerp free, the fourth phase of the Battle of the Scheldt was complete; on 28 November, the first convoy entered the port. =Veritable and Grenade= Kleve was heavily bombed in February 1945 Montgomery's 21st Army Group were tasked with clearing the west bank of the Rhine downstream from the Krefeld area. The approach was for the Canadian 1st Army‚Äîstrengthened by XXX Corps‚Äîto advance south-eastward between the Rhine and Maas rivers while the U.S. Ninth Army advanced north eastwards from the Roer. The two armies would meet in the Geldern area. The British Second Army stayed west of the Maas, apart from two divisions that reinforced the Anglo-Canadian advance, but the German High Command were initially convinced that they were the principal threat and deployed their reserves in anticipation of an assault from Venlo. The two operations were delayed by the 'Battle of the Bulge' but they were rescheduled for 8 February 1945. Although the Anglo-Canadian attack (Operation Veritable) started on time, the US assault (Operation Grenade) was delayed by the threat and then the danger of flooding by water released from the Roer dams. This delay allowed the Germans to concentrate their defence on the Anglo-Canadian assaults, but they were unable to do much more than to slow it down in localised areas. When the Americans were able to advance, some two weeks later, there were few reserves left to face them and they made rapid progress until they encountered the German rearguard near the Rhine. The two prongs met at Geldern, then pushed towards Rees, finally expelling German forces on 21 March. Central Group of Armies (12th Army Group) =Aachen= The advance of Allied forces between 26 August and 14 September 1944 The U.S. First Army was focused on capturing the city of Aachen, which had to be dealt with before advancing to assault the Siegfried Line itself. Initially, the city of Aachen was to be bypassed and cut off in an attempt by the Allies to imitate the Blitzkrieg tactics the Germans had so effectively used (see below). However, the city was the first to be assaulted on German soil and so had huge historical and cultural significance for the German people. Adolf Hitler personally ordered that the garrison there be reinforced and the city held. This forced the Allied commanders to re-think their strategy. Some historians, including Stephen E. Ambrose, have suggested that the siege of Aachen was a mistake. The battle stalled the eastward advance by the Allies and caused approximately 5,000 Allied casualties. The fighting was, by all accounts, brutal street-to-street, house-to-house style urban combat and tied up the available resources of the advancing Allied armies. Ambrose has suggested that a more effective strategy would have been to have isolated the garrison at Aachen and continue the move east into the heart of Germany. In theory, this would have eliminated the ability of the German garrison to operate as a fighting force by cutting off their supply lines. This might have forced them to surrender or to move out of the city in an attempt to re-establish their supply lines. In the case of the latter, a confrontation in a more neutral setting would probably have resulted in fewer military and civilian casualties. =Lorraine= In late August, the U.S. Third Army started to run low on fuel. This situation was caused by the rapid Allied advance through France, and compounded by the shift of logistical priority to the northern forces to secure Antwerp. By 1 September 1944, with the last of its fuel, the Third Army managed one final push to capture key bridges over the Meuse River at Verdun and Commercy. Five days after that, however, the critical supply situation effectively caused the Third Army to grind to a halt, allowing previously routed German forces to regroup and the reinforcement of their strongholds in the area. Soon after, the Third Army came up against Metz, part of the Maginot Line and one of the most heavily fortified cities in Western Europe. The city could not be bypassed, as several of its forts had guns directed at Moselle crossing sites and the main roads in the area. It could also be used as a stronghold to organize a German counter-attack to the Third Army's rear. In the following Battle of Metz, the Third Army, while victorious, took heavy casualties. Following Metz, the Third Army continued eastwards to the Saar River and soon began their assault on the Siegfried Line. =H√ºrtgen Forest= German troops defending the H√ºrtgen in November 1944. H√ºrtgen Forest was seen as a possible location for incursions into the American flank, and the river dams in the area were a threat to the Allied advance downstream, so an assault to clear the area was started on 19 September 1944. German defence was more stubborn than expected and the terrain was highly favourable to defence, largely negating the American advantages of numbers and quality of troops. The battle‚Äîexpected to last a few weeks‚Äîcontinued until February 1945 and cost 33,000 casualties (from all causes). The value of the battle has been disputed. Modern historians argue that the outcome was not worth the foreseeable losses, and in any case, the American tactics played into German hands.Weigley (1981), pp. 364-369 =Operation Queen= Operation Queen was a combined Allied air-ground offensive against the German forces at the Siegfried Line, which was conducted mainly by the combined effort of the U.S. Ninth and First Armies. The principal goal of the operation was to advance to the Roer River and to establish several bridgeheads over it, for a subsequent thrust into Germany to the Rhine River. Parts of this operation also included further fighting in the Hurtgen Forest. The offensive commenced on 16 November with one of the heaviest tactical air bombardments by the western Allies of the war. Although the German forces were heavily outnumbered, the Allied advance was very slow. After four weeks of intensive fighting, the Allies reached the Roer, but were not able to establish any bridgeheads over it. Fighting in the Hurtgen Forest also bogged down. The exhaustive fighting during Queen caused the Allied troops to suffer heavy casualties, and eventually the Germans launched their own counteroffensive‚ÄîOperation Wacht am Rhein‚Äîon 16 December, which would lead to the Battle of the Bulge. Winter counter-offensives American soldiers taking up defensive positions in the Ardennes during the Battle of the Bulge. The Germans had been preparing a massive counter-attack in the West since the Allied breakout from Normandy. The plan called Wacht am Rhein (\\"Watch on the Rhine\\") was to attack through the Ardennes and swing North to Antwerp, splitting the American and British armies. The attack started on 16 December in what became known as the Battle of the Bulge. Defending the Ardennes were troops of the U.S. First Army. After initial successes in bad weather, which gave the Germans cover from the Allied air forces, the Allies launched a counterattack to clear them from the Ardennes. The Germans were eventually pushed back to their starting points by 25 January 1945. The Germans launched a second, smaller offensive (Nordwind) into Alsace on 1 January 1945. Aiming to recapture Strasbourg, they attacked the 6th Army Group at multiple points. Because Allied lines had become severely stretched in response to the crisis in the Ardennes, holding and throwing back the Nordwind offensive was a costly affair that lasted almost four weeks. Allied counter-attacks restored the front line to the area of the German border and collapsed the Colmar Pocket. Germany west of the Rhine  The pincer movement of the Canadian First Army, advancing from the Nijmegen area in Operation Veritable, and the U.S. Ninth Army, crossing the Roer in Operation Grenade, was planned to start on 8 February 1945, but it was delayed by two weeks when the Germans flooded the Roer valley by destroying the floodgates of two dams on the upper Roer (Rur Dam and Urft Dam). During the two weeks that the little river was flooded, Hitler did not allow Rundstedt to withdraw German forces behind the Rhine, arguing that it would only delay the inevitable fight. Hitler ordered him to fight where his forces stood. By the time the water had subsided and the U.S. Ninth Army was able to cross the Roer on 23 February, other Allied forces were also close to the Rhine's west bank. The German divisions that had remained on the west bank of the Rhine were cut to pieces, and 280,000 men were taken prisoner. The stubborn German resistance had been costly; their total losses reached an estimated 400,000 men.Zaloga, Dennis p. 88 Aftermath American soldiers crossing the Rhine river in assault boats The Allies crossed the Rhine at four points. One crossing was an opportunity taken by U.S. forces when the Germans failed to blow up the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen; another was a hasty assault; and two crossings were planned: * The U.S. First Army aggressively pursued the disintegrating German troops, and on 7 March they unexpectedly captured the Ludendorff Bridge across the Rhine River at Remagen. The 9th Armored Division quickly expanded the bridgehead into a full scale crossing. * Bradley told General George S. Patton‚Äîwhose U.S. Third Army had been fighting through the Palatinate‚Äîto \\"take the Rhine on the run\\". The Third Army did just that on the night of 22/23 March, crossing the river with a hasty assault south of Mainz at Oppenheim. * In the north, the Rhine is twice as wide, with a far higher volume of water than where the Americans crossed. Montgomery, commander of the 21st Army Group, decided it could be crossed safely only with a carefully prepared attack. In Operation Plunder he crossed the Rhine at Rees and Wesel on the night of 23/24 March, including the largest single drop airborne operation in history, Operation Varsity. * In the Allied 6th Army Group area, the U.S. Seventh Army assaulted across the Rhine in the area between Mannheim and Worms on 26 March. A fifth crossing on a smaller scale was later achieved by the French First Army at Speyer. After crossing the Rhine, the Allies rapidly advanced into Germany's heartland. The end of World War II in Europe followed soon after.

It is in the southern dock system, connected to Salthouse Dock and Wapping Dock to the east. The Albert Dock is located immediately north, although not directly accessible by water. History The land for the dock was obtained in 1768. Opening in 1773, Duke's Dock was built privately for the Duke of Bridgewater as a Liverpool-based facility for traffic using the Bridgewater Canal from Manchester. The dock was probably designed by James Brindley, who also built the Bridgewater Canal. The first dockside warehouse on the Mersey was built at the dock in 1783, and the dock was extended in the 1790s due to growth in the cotton industry. In 1811, a large six-storey warehouse was built on the southern side of the dock. Barges were able to enter the warehouse from the dock, and the building lasted until the 1960s. In 1845, a small half-tide dock was constructed between Duke's Dock and the river and, at the opposite end of the dock, Wapping Basin was added in 1855. The dock was purchased by the MD&HB; in 1900, and the warehouses remained until 1960. The dock had a southern branch which was filled in 1967, and warehouses were removed from the north and south quaysides. The dock closed in 1972. =After closure= After the closure of Duke's Dock, the dock silted up during the following decade and the quayside was in a state of considerable dereliction by 1980. In 1980, disused buildings including one of the Liverpool Lighterage Company, a training school and a customs house still remained on the north quayside. Water balling at Duke's Dock. The Albert Dock warehouses are to the left, with Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral beyond the footbridge in the background. In 1981, the Merseyside Development Corporation was established to rejuvenate the South Docks, and the dock was dredged between 1981-5. The river entrance was filled in during the 1980s, and replaced with a permanent roadway leading to a large temporary car park on the site of King's Dock. Footbridges across the dock, leading from the King's Dock car park to the rejuvenated Albert Dock, were also installed at this time. The remaining buildings on the north quayside were also removed, to create permanent car parking space for the Albert Dock. Present use Direct river access to the west is no longer provided, with the only remains of the river entrance being markings on the dock wall. The dock is still accessible from Wapping Basin. The water depth varies from around up to . The dock is sometimes used by sport scuba divers. Its water is clear and it has much underwater sealife. The waterspace, of this and the other docks in the southern system, was owned by British Waterways from 2003 to 2012 and now transferred to the Canal & River Trust. Water balling is now allowed on the dock.

Manchester Dock shown unlabelled to the left of the graving docks. Manchester Dock was a dock on the River Mersey in England and a part of the Port of Liverpool. The dock was not part of the interconnected dock system, but was connected directly to the river. History In the 1780s, the docks at Liverpool were expanding, and the Manchester Basin was built to the north of the Canning Dock. It was a tidal basin which was linked directly to the river, and was not linked directly to the other docks. The benefits of turning it into a proper dock were soon realised, and an entrance lock was constructed between 1810 and 1815, by John Foster, Sr., after which it was known as the Manchester Dock. The dock was an important gateway for the export of coal and manufactured goods, and for the import of corn and cotton. With the formation of the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company in 1845, the dock was used to hold their barges, and later those of the Great Western Railway, who transferred goods between the dock and their rail terminal at Morpeth Dock in Birkenhead. The Liverpool Docks were controlled by the Docks Committee between 1825 and 1857. During this period, the total area of the docks was increased from 82 to , and the length of the quays was by 1857. Most of the increase was achieved by the construction of new docks, but they also purchased the Manchester Dock in 1851. Control of the docks passed to the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board in 1858. By the 1920s, the dock traffic waned. Manchester Dock and the adjacent Chester Basin were dangerously subsiding because of excavation works for the Queensway Tunnel which ran underneath the site. Both docks were filled in by 1936, using rubble obtained from the construction of the tunnel. The area later became a car park, sealing the remains under a protective layer of tarmac. Excavation The dock gate on display at the Museum of Liverpool. In 2006/7, the dock was excavated as part of a major construction project for the new Museum of Liverpool and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal link to the Canning and Albert Docks. These excavations also exposed the neighbouring Chester Basin, and have provided important archaeological information as the entrance lock is one of the oldest in the whole Liverpool Docks complex. Most other locks of a similar age have either been destroyed or extensively modified.

It was directed by Oliver Stone and starred Colin Farrell. The film's original screenplay derived in part from the book Alexander the Great, published in 1973 by the University of Oxford historian Robin Lane Fox. After release, while it performed well in Europe, the American critical reaction was negative. It grossed over $167 million worldwide against a $155 million budget, becoming a box-office bomb. Four versions of the film exist, the initial theatrical cut and three home video director's cuts: the \\"Director's Cut\\" in 2005, the \\"Final Cut\\" in 2007 and the \\"Ultimate Cut\\" in 2013. The two earlier DVD versions of Alexander (\\"director's cut\\" version and the theatrical version) sold over 3.5 million copies in the United States.Retrieved from Videobusiness.com Oliver Stone's third version, Alexander Revisited: The Final Cut (2007), sold nearly a million copies . Plot The story begins around 283 BC, with Ptolemy I Soter, who narrates throughout the film. Alexander grows up with his mother Olympias and his tutor Aristotle, where he finds interest in love, honor, music, exploration, poetry and military combat. His relationship with his father is destroyed when Philip marries Attalus's niece, Eurydice. Alexander insults Philip after disowning Attalus as his kinsman, which results in Alexander's banishment from Philip's palace. After Philip is assassinated, Alexander becomes King of Macedonia. Ptolemy mentions Alexander's punitive campaign in which he razes Thebes, also referring to the later burning of Persepolis, then gives an overview of Alexander's west-Persian campaign, including his declaration as the son of Zeus by the Oracle of Amun at Siwa Oasis, his great battle against the Persian Emperor Darius III in the Battle of Gaugamela, and his eight-year campaign across Asia. Also seen are Alexander's private relationships with his childhood friend Hephaistion, Bagoas, and later his wife, Roxana. Hephaistion compares Alexander to Achilles, to which Alexander replies that Hephaistion must be his Patroclus (Achilles' lover) when Hephaistion mentions that Patroclus died first, Alexander pledges that, if Hephaistion should die first, he will follow him into the afterlife (as Achilles had done for Patroclus). Hephaistion shows extensive jealousy when he sees Alexander with Roxana and deep sadness when he marries her, going so far as to attempt to keep her away from him after Alexander murders Cleitus the Black in India. After initial objection from his soldiers, Alexander convinces them to join him in his final and bloodiest battle, the Battle of Hydaspes. He is severely injured with an arrow but survives and is celebrated. Later on, Hephaistion succumbs to an unknown illness either by chance or perhaps poison, speculated in the movie to be typhus carried with him from India. Alexander, full of grief and anger, distances himself from his wife, despite her pregnancy, believing that she has killed Hephaistion. He dies less than three months after Hephaistion, in the same manner, keeping his promise that he would follow him. On his deathbed, Bagoas grieves as Alexander's generals begin to split up his kingdom and fight over the ownership of his body. The story then returns to 283 BC, where Ptolemy admits to his scribe that he, along with all the other officers, had indeed poisoned Alexander just to spare themselves from any future conquests or consequences. However, he has it recorded that Alexander died due to illness compounding his overall weakened condition. He then goes on to end his memoirs with praise to Alexander. The story then ends with the note that Ptolemy's memoirs of Alexander were eventually burned, lost forever with the Library of Alexandria.

They marched in discipline, and music was actually used...\\" Oliver Stone has, in his various commentaries in the film's DVD, defended many of the most glaring historical issues in regard to Persian and Indian history by claiming that he had no time or resources to portray accurately a multitude of battles at the expense of storytelling. He goes into great detail explaining how he merged all the major aspects of the Battle of the Granicus and the Battle of Issus into the Battle of Gaugamela, as well as heavily simplifying the Battle of Hydaspes into a straightforward clash, while merging the near-death of Alexander with the siege of Malli. However, early- Greek-history ethnographer/analyst Angelos Chaniotis, of Princeton's noted Institute for Advanced Study‚Äîin summarizing the first three versions of the film as \\"as a dramatisation, [rather than] a documentary\\"‚Äînevertheless insists that, despite its imperfections, historians and history students \\"have a lot to learn\\" by \\"studying and reflecting upon\\" Stone's film. He concludes that, as a motion picture that \\"captures the Zeitgeist\\" (spirit of the times) of the \\"ancient Greek\\" era, \\"no film... can rival Oliver Stone's Alexander.\\"\\"Making Alexander Fit for the Twenty-first Century: Oliver Stone‚Äôs Alexander\\" in Hellas on Screen: Cinematic Receptions of Ancient Literature, Myth and History (I.

Upon closing on 1 February 2005, the film grossed $34.3 million domestically and $133 million overseas for a worldwide total of $167.3 million. Based on a $155 million production budget, as well as additional marketing costs, the film was a box office bomb, with projected losses of as much as $71 million.Waxman, S., 2004.

The website's critical consensus states: \\"Even at nearly three hours long, this ponderous, talky, and emotionally distant biopic fails to illuminate Alexander's life.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 39 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". One of the principal complaints among American film critics was that Alexander resembled less an action-drama film than a history documentary. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun- Times wrote in his review, \\"[W]e welcome the scenes of battle, pomp and circumstance because at least for a time we are free of the endless narration of Ptolemy the historian.\\" Faint praise came from Todd McCarthy of Variety who wrote, \\"Oliver Stone's Alexander is at best an honorable failure, an intelligent and ambitious picture that crucially lacks dramatic flair and emotional involvement. Dry and academic where Troy (2004) was vulgar and willfully ahistorical\\". Keith Uhlich of The A.V. Club named Alexander: The Ultimate Cut the tenth-best film of 2014. =Nominations= The film was nominated in six categories at the Golden Raspberry Awards in 2005: Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Colin Farrell), Worst Actress (Angelina Jolie) and Worst Director (Oliver Stone), Worst Supporting Actor (Val Kilmer) and Worst Screenplay, thereby becoming the second-most-nominated potential \\"Razzie\\" film of 2004; however, it won no awards. At the 2004 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, it received nine nominations: Worst Picture, Worst Director (Stone), Worst Actor (Farrell), Worst Supporting Actress (both Jolie and Dawson), Worst Screenplay, Most Intrusive Musical Score, Worst Female Fake Accent (Dawson and Jolie, lumped into one nomination), and Least \\"Special\\" Special Effects. Its only wins were for Most Intrusive Musical Score and Worst Female Fake Accent. Versions Several versions of the film have been released, and these have generally been seen as improvements on the initial release version.https://variety.com/2007/digital/features/alexander-revisited-the- final-cut-1200560073/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/10/2 Critic Peter Sobczynski said \\"The various expansions and rejiggerings have improved it immeasurably, and what was once a head-scratching mess has reformed into an undeniably fascinating example of epic cinema.\\"https://www.rogerebert.com/streaming/a-reappraisal-of-oliver-stones- alexander-the-ultimate-cut =Theatrical cut= 2004: This is the film as it was originally released in theaters, with a running time of 175 minutes. It was released on DVD and is also available on Blu-ray in some territories. =Director's cut= 2005: Stone's director's cut was re-edited before the DVD release later in 2005. Stone removed seventeen minutes of footage and added nine back. This shortened the running time from 175 minutes to 167. ='Alexander Revisited: The Final Unrated Cut'= 2007: Stone also made an extended version of Alexander. \\"I'm doing a third version on DVD, not theatrical\\", he said, in an interview with Rope of Silicon. \\"I'm going to do a Cecil B. DeMille three-hour-45-minute thing; I'm going to go all out, put everything I like in the movie. He [Alexander] was a complicated man, it was a complicated story, and it doesn't hurt to make it longer and let people who loved the film [...] see it more and understand it more.\\" The extended version was released under the title of Alexander Revisited: The Final Unrated Cut on 27 February 2007. The two-disc set featured a new introduction by Stone. \\"Over the last two years,\\" he said, \\"I have been able to sort out some of the unanswered questions about this highly complicated and passionate monarch ‚Äì questions I failed to answer dramatically enough. This film represents my complete and last version, as it will contain all the essential footage we shot. I don't know how many film-makers have managed to make three versions of the same film, but I have been fortunate to have the opportunity because of the success of video and DVD sales in the world, and I felt, if I didn't do it now, with the energy and memory I still have for the subject, it would never quite be the same again. For me, this is the complete Alexander, the clearest interpretation I can offer.\\"\\"Oliver Stone's Alexander Gets Another DVD Release The final, final cut is now confirmed...\\" By Brad Brevet (Monday, 18 December 2006) The film is restructured into two acts with an intermission. Alexander: Revisited takes a more in-depth look at Alexander's life and his relationships with Olympias, Philip, Hephaestion, Roxana, and Ptolemy. The film has a running time of three hours and 34 minutes (214 minutes, about 40 minutes longer than the theatrical cut and almost 50 minutes longer than the first director's cut) and is presented in 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen with English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround audio. Beyond the new introduction with Stone, there are no other extras on the DVD except for a free coupon to the movie 300. The Blu-ray and HD-DVD releases both feature a variety of special features however, including two audio commentaries and a new featurette. For seven years, it was the only version of the film available on Blu-ray, until the release of the Ultimate Cut, which also includes the Theatrical Cut. =Ultimate cut= 2014: In November 2012, Stone revealed that he was working on a fourth cut of the film, at Warner's request and that this time around he would remove material, as he felt he had added in too much in the \\"Final Cut\\". The version, which is 206 minutes long, premiered on 3 July 2013 at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival and Stone swears that no more versions will follow. In February 2014, Oliver Stone announced on Twitter that 'Alexander the Ultimate Cut (Tenth Anniversary Edition)' would be released in the United States on 3 June 2014.

The Huaorani, Waorani, or Waodani, also known as the Waos, are native Amerindians from the Amazonian Region of Ecuador (Napo, Orellana, and Pastaza Provinces) who have marked differences from other ethnic groups from Ecuador. The alternate name Auca is a pejorative exonym used by the neighboring Quechua natives, and commonly adopted by Spanish- speakers as well. Auca (' in Quechua) means \\"savage\\". They comprise almost 4,000 inhabitants and speak the Huaorani language, a linguistic isolate that is not known to be related to any other language. Their ancestral lands are located between the Curaray and Napo rivers, about 50 miles (80 km) south of El Coca. These homelands‚Äîapproximately 120 miles (190 km) wide and 75 to 100 miles (120 to 160 km) from north to south ‚Äì are threatened by oil exploration and illegal logging practices. In the past, Huaorani were able to protect their culture and lands from both indigenous enemies and settlers. In the last 40 years, they have shifted from a hunting and gathering society to live mostly in permanent forest settlements. As many as five communities‚Äîthe Tagaeri, the Hui√±atare, the O√±amenane, and two groups of the Taromenane‚Äîhave rejected all contact with the outside world and continue to move into more isolated areas.  Etymology  The word ' (plural of ' \\"person\\") means \\"humans\\" or \\"men\\" in '. Before the mid 20th century, it included only those kin associated with the speaker. Others in the ethnic group were called Waodoni, while outsiders were and are known by the derogatory term '. This structure duplicates the in-group/out-group naming conventions used by many peoples. It reflects a period of traumatic conflict with outsiders during the 19th and early 20th century rubber boom / oil exploration. The name ' (or the alternative English spelling Waorani) represents a transliteration by English- speaking missionary linguists. The phonetic equivalent used by Spanish- speakers is ' (reflecting the absence of w in Spanish spelling). The sounds represented by the English and Spanish letters d, r and n are allophones in '. https://www.sil.org/system/files/reapdata/16/08/22/160822378710000347123672599515131741594/10039.pdf retrieved 8/21/19  Tribal subgroups  The Waorani are subdivided into the To√±ampare, Quenahueno, Tihueno, Quihuaro, Damuintaro, Zapino, Tig√ºino, Huamuno, Dayuno, Quehueruno, Garzacocha (r√≠o Yasun√≠), Quemperi (r√≠o Cononaco) Mima, Caruhue (r√≠o Cononaco) and Tagaeri.  First encounter, as told by Scott Wallace  According to Scott Wallace, American missionaries in Ecuador attempted to contact the Huaorani in the 1950s with airdropped gifts. However, the photographs included in the package baffled the Huaorani (since they had never seen photographs before), and they believed the images were evil magical creations. When some Huaorani tribesmen found some missionaries who had landed a plane on a riverbank, the tribesmen speared the Westerners to death.The Unconquered: In Search of the Amazon's Lost Tribes, First Edition, Crown Publishers, United States, 2011, p. 228  Culture  = Worldview = In traditional animist Waodani worldview, there is no distinction between the physical and spiritual worlds, and spirits are present throughout the world. The Waodani once believed that the entire world was a forest (and used the same word, ', for both). The Oriente's rain forest remains the essential basis of their physical and cultural survival. For them, the forest is home, while the outside world is considered unsafe. In short, as one Waodani put it, ‚ÄúThe rivers and trees are our life.‚Äù In all its specificities, the forest is woven into each Waodani life and conceptions of the world. They have remarkably detailed knowledge of its geography and ecology. Hunting supplies a major part of the Waodani diet and is of cultural significance. Before a hunting or fishing party ensues, the community shaman will often pray for a day to ensure its success. Traditionally the creatures hunted were limited to monkeys, birds, and wild peccaries. Neither land-based predators nor birds of prey are hunted. Traditionally there was an extensive collection of hunting and eating taboos. They refused to eat deer, on the grounds that deer eyes look similar to human eyes. While a joyful activity, hunting (even permitted animals) has ethical ramifications: ‚ÄúThe Guarani [Waodani] must kill animals to live, but they believed dead animal spirits live on and must be placated or else do harm in angry retribution.‚Äù To counterbalance the offense of hunting, a shaman demonstrated respect through the ritual preparation of the poison, curare, used in blow darts. Hunting with such darts is not considered killing, but retrieving, essentially a kind of harvesting from the trees. Plants, especially trees, continue to hold an important interest for the Waodani. Their store of botanical knowledge is extensive, ranging from knowledge of materials to poisons to hallucinogens to medicines. They also relate plants to their own experiences, particularly that of growing. Among trees, certain kinds are auspicious. Canopy trees, with their distinctly colored young leaves and striking transformation as they mature to towering giants, are ‚Äúadmired for their solitary character... as well as for their profuse entanglement‚Äù with other plants. Other significant trees are the pioneer species of the peach palm (used for making spears and blowguns, as well as for fruit), and fast-growing balsa wood, used for ceremonial purposes. Peach palm trees are associated with past settlements and the ancestors who live there. Shamanic ethnomedicine uses the ayahuasca beverage . and a newly identified mushroom (Dictyonema huaorani) with the analogous substance of Psilocybe genus.. As with many peoples, the Waos maintain a strong in-group/out-group distinction, between ' (people who are kin), ' (others in their culture who are unrelated) and '. The use of Waodani as a term for their entire culture emerged in the last fifty years in a process of ethnogenesis. This was accelerated by the creation of ONHAE, a radio service, and a soccer league. The Waodani notion of time is particularly oriented to the present, with few obligations extending backwards or forwards in time. Their one word for future times, ', also means \\"tomorrow\\". = Weapons = A Huaorani blowgun Spears are amongst the hunting tools of the Waodani culture and therefore available in person to person conflict. Their main hunting weapon is the blowgun. These weapons are typically from 3 to 4 metres long. The arrows used are dipped in curare poison, which paralyzes the muscles of the animal with which it is hit, so that it cannot breathe. Kapok fluff is used to create an air-tight seal, by twisting the fibers around the end of the dart or arrow. With the introduction of Western technology in the 20t century, many Waodani now use rifles for hunting.  Land rights  In 1990, the Waorani won the rights to the Waorani Ethnic Reserve . The protected status of Yasun√≠ National Park, which overlaps with the Waorani reserve, provides some measure of environmental protection. Additionally, the government has created a protected zone inside of Yasuni, to avoid contact with the Tagaeri and Taromenane. However, much of their land is illegally logged as corporations (petroleum companies) extract natural resources without reimbursement, forcing them onto smaller and smaller parcels.

The Ohio Military Reserve serves under the Governor as Commander-in-Chief through the office of the Adjutant General of Ohio and is headquartered at the Haubrich Armory in Columbus, Ohio. The OHMR has a \\"sister service\\", the Ohio Naval Militia which operates out of Camp Perry, located near Port Clinton, Ohio. History =20th century= During World War I, 120 companies of Home Guard were organized across the cities and towns of Ohio to replace the Ohio National Guard, which was sent overseas. Organized at a local level, members were classified as policemen or deputy sheriffs by local authorities. In 1918, the Governor of Ohio recognized the units officially, reclassifying them as the Ohio Home Guard under authority of the governor, so that they could receive rifles and other equipment from the federal government. The Ohio Home Guard was reactivated during World War II under the name \\"Ohio State Guard.\\" The Ohio State Guard reached a strength of over 4,000 by June 1944. Among other responsibilities, the Ohio State Guard staffed a mobile gas warfare demonstration school which instructed more than 25,000 civil defense workers in addition to its own units. Ohio maintained its state defense through the Cold War as well. The Ohio Defense Corps was established in May 1949; a minimum cadre for five regiments was recruited within a month. =Reorganization= Sgt. Terry Boyd, assigned to the Ohio Military Reserve‚Äôs Bravo Company 1st Battalion, packages meal boxes at the Toledo Northwestern Ohio Food Bank. In 2009, the OHMR underwent a reorganization which changed its mission to emergency management. The OHMR began a transformation process that took it from its former mission as a cadre state defense force held in reserve to its current mission as an active force. The current mission focuses on FEMA Emergency Support Functions (ESF) 6 and 7. This includes aiding in operating mass care facilities (ESF 6) and warehouses, distribution centers, and support facilities (ESF 7). The transformation took part in three phases. The first phase was integration, which ended in September 2010. In the second phase, the OHMR became initially operational capable during the Fiscal Year 2011, and the third resulted in the OHMR becoming fully operational capable in Fiscal Year 2012. =Modern era= On 25 October 2019, Governor Mike DeWine signed into law a bill which created a volunteer Ohio Cyber Reserve (OhCR) made up of trained civilians and organized as a part of the Ohio Military Reserve. The stated purpose of the unit is to be available for the governor to assist eligible municipalities with cybersecurity vulnerabilities and provide recommendations to reduce cyber threats. The first teams are expected to be created by the end of January 2020. Beginning in March 2020, members of the Ohio Military Reserve were activated as a part of Operation Steady Resolve, as part of Ohio‚Äôs response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The initial mission was to assist twelve food banks across Ohio with packaging, transporting and distributing food and other essential items to vulnerable populations across Ohio. In Columbus, the National Guard and Military Reserve packed boxes and served meals to men staying at the Downtown YMCA, including those who have been relocated from homeless shelters. Personnel and training Enlistment is voluntary, however all soldiers swear an oath of enlistment or appointment. Officers hold state, not federal, commissions. Units are co-located in state- owned readiness centers (armories) with National Guard units across the state. Most units drill one weekend a month and all troops must attend one week of training annually (annual training, or AT). In the past, troops trained with pistols and shotguns, however, the cost of maintenance and annual re- certification has caused this training to be dropped. Although they are covered by the State‚Äôs insurance and workers‚Äô compensation program, soldiers are not paid for their training time or AT period. However, if mobilized, they would be compensated. ¬ß5903.02 of the Ohio Revised Code provides OHMR personnel protection under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act (USERRA) which addresses military leave from employment for both training and deployment. In 2010, the as part of its shift to an emergency management mission, the OHMR sponsored training on National Incident Management System (NIMS) compliance and Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT) for all soldiers in the OHMR. The OHMR maintains a military training academy to conduct state versions of standard Army professional development courses such as Basic Entry Level Training (required for all non-prior service personnel), Primary Leadership Development Course, Basic Non-commissioned Officer Course, and the Basic Officer Course. In addition, the OHMR Academy offers a series of Army Institute for Professional Development (AIPD) correspondence courses. OHMR members can earn the Military Emergency Management Specialist Badge from the State Guard Association of the United States, The badge includes Basic, Senior and Master level qualifications. Uniform State Defense Force Beret Flash The current uniform of OHMR is the OCP (Operational Camouflage Pattern) with tan name tags, the Ohio flag patch on the right arm and OHMR unit patch on the left arm. The members of OHMR are authorized to wear the Army Service Uniform (ASU), with the exception of a red, rather than black, nameplate, OHMR or Ohio buttons, and SDF specific insignia. The OHMR wears the service cap (with modified insignia) with the ASU as well as the black beret with the red \\"State Defense Force\\" Beret Flash worn by some other states.Wear and Appearance of Uniforms and Insignia, Ohio Military Reserve Regulation 670-1, Ohio Military Reserve, dated 1 May 2012, last accessed 1 May 2020 Legal protection Under Ohio law, members of the Ohio Military Reserve are guaranteed the same employment rights and protections as federal reservists enjoy under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA). Among other legal rights guaranteed under this provision, OHMR members are protected from discrimination based on their membership in the OHMR both during the hiring process and after becoming employed; they are also guaranteed a leave of absence from their places of employment whenever they are activated for training or to take part in an emergency, and their employers are required to reinstate these employees to their previous positions when they return from deployment.

In its modern form it favours the reversal of federalism and the creation of a unitary state in Belgium. The ideology advocates reduced or no autonomy for the Flemish Community who constitute Flanders, the French Community of Belgium and the German-speaking Community of Belgium who constitute Wallonia and the Brussels-Capital Region which is inhabited by both Walloons and Flemings, and the dissolution of the regional counterparts of each ethnic group within Belgium. It insists on restoring total sovereignty to the level of the Belgian state by reverting Belgium to a unitary state, after decades of state structure reforms that made Belgium a federal state since the 1970s - contrary to Flemish nationalists who advocate independence of their region, and Walloon, Brussels and German-speaking regionalists who advocate more autonomy to their respective regions. Belgian nationalists advocate the unity between all language groups in Belgium, and condemn each perceived chauvinistic or linguistic discrimination, advocate the knowledge of all official languages (Dutch, French, German) and a multicultural, tolerant, strong feeling of citizenship. Belgian nationalism is mainly supported by French-speaking politicians, alongside some socialists, certain circles in Brussels and some sections of the far right. Because the Flanders region is by large majority regionalist (although the majority in Flanders do not favor independence of their region) and because both the Wallonia and Brussels regions and the German community are also by majority regionalist, there is no popular support for Belgian nationalism in any region of Belgium, and political parties that support this ideology openly have not gained electoral support in recent years, so it remains much weaker than the secessionist and regional nationalisms of the ethnic groups.

The species is endemic to Central America and South America, where it is found near rivers and streams in rainforests. It is also known as the Jesus Christ lizard, Jesus lizard, South American Jesus lizard, or lagarto de Jesus Cristo for its ability to run on the surface of water. Description The common basilisk can be distinguished from similar species within its range by its large size and the high fin-like crest along its back. Most common basilisks are brown and cream in colour. Males also have high crests on the head and tail. Both sexes are brown to olive, and have a white, cream, or yellow stripe on the upper lip and a second stripe along either side of the body; these stripes have higher contrast in juveniles and fade as the lizards age. Hatchlings weigh a mere and are long. Adults can grow to a total length (including tail) of 76 cm (2.5 feet). Females are generally , and weigh half as much as males. The tail comprises 70 to 75% of the total length: for example, a 70-cm-long (27.5-inch-long) common basilisk would have a 50-cm-long (19.5-inch-long) tail. The common basilisk has a large mouth with saw-like teeth on the inner sides of the jaw. While the common basilisk is most known for its ability to run on water, it is also an excellent climber and swimmer, and has been known to stay under water for up to half an hour. The average lifespan is seven years in captivity; in the wild, it tends to be less because of predators. When startled, the common basilisk escapes by speeding to the nearest edge of water‚Äîand continues sprinting. The lizard runs on only its hind legs in an erect position, holding its fore legs to its sides. The common basilisk is adroit on water because its feet are large and equipped with flaps of skin along the toes that allow it to catch on tiny air bubbles. When moving quickly, the lizard can cross a surface of water before sinking. On water, it runs an average speed of 24.1 km/h (or 15 mph), which is just a little slower than its speed on land. Younger basilisks can run on water, while adults cross only a few meters before sinking. Adults do not move slowly, but they weigh more and cannot sprint for as long a time. Once a basilisk submerges, it continues swimming until it is sufficiently far from its pursuer ‚Äî if the predator has followed past the bank. Although the common basilisk stays close to water to escape terrestrial predators, it swims only when necessary because some other aquatic animals would eat it given the chance. Geographic range and habitat The common basilisk is found in tropical rainforests throughout Central America and in northwestern South America, usually living in low elevations, from sea level to . In Costa Rica, this basilisk can be found as high as in some places. The species ranges from southwestern Nicaragua to northwestern Colombia on the Pacific side, and from central Panama to northwestern Venezuela on the Atlantic side. In Costa Rica, it is mostly found on the Pacific side of the country. The equivalent species on the Atlantic side is the green basilisk (Basiliscus plumifrons), which occupies similar habitats and has similar biology. Diet B. basiliscus is an omnivore; its diet consists of insects, for example, beetles or dragon flies; flowers, and small vertebrates such as snakes, birds, eggs, and fish. Predators The common basilisk has many natural predators: large reptiles, birds, and some mammals. To avoid predators, it can conceal itself under leaves on the forest floor and can remain motionless for a long time. When the common basilisk must flee, though, its skill of running on water can help it avoid many predators, and when the common basilisk can no longer run on the water, it will use its strong swimming capabilities to continue underwater. Reproduction Females of B. basiliscus lay three to four clutches of 10‚Äì20 eggs a year. Eggs hatch after about three months and the young weigh about two grams and are up to three inches long. Their outstanding camouflage allows them to remain undetected when they remain still. Walking on water Running on water The common basilisk, along with the other members of its genus, take the nickname the \\"Jesus Christ lizard\\" or \\"Jesus lizard\\" because when fleeing from predators, they gather sufficient momentum to run across the water for a brief distance while holding most of their body out of the water (similar to the biblical story of Jesus walking on water). Basilisks have large hind feet with scaly fringes on the sides of the third, fourth, and fifth toes. These are compressed against the toes when this lizard walks on land; but if it senses danger, it can jump into the water, opening up these fringes against the water's surface. This increases the surface area of the foot, thus allowing it to run on the water for short distances. This occurs in three steps. First is the slap, the downward movement of the foot that pushes water out and away from the leg. This also created pockets of air around the foot. Next is the stroke, the backwards movement of the foot, which propels it forward. Next is the recovery, when the foot comes up and out of the water and prepares to do the slap again. Smaller basilisks can run about 10‚Äì20 m without sinking. Juveniles can usually run farther than older basilisks, while holding more of their body above the surface. Taxonomy and etymology The common basilisk is named for the creature of Greek mythology made up of parts of a rooster, snake, and lion which could turn a man to stone by its gaze: the basilisk. Its generic, specific, and common names all derive from the Greek basil√≠skos (Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒØœÉŒ∫ŒøœÇ) meaning \\"little king\\". The specific epithet was given in Carl Linnaeus' 10th edition of Systema Naturae.

After practicing law with some distinction (and a brief stint as politician in North Carolina), Hawks became an Episcopal priest in 1827 and proved a brilliant and impressive preacher, holding livings (a church benefice including revenues) in New Haven, Philadelphia, New York City and New Orleans, and declining several bishoprics. However, scandals during the 1830s and 40s led him to posts on the American frontier and rejection of his selection as bishop of Mississippi, although Hawks then became the first president of the University of Louisiana (now known as Tulane University), then moved to Baltimore, Maryland, and eventually returned to New York City. Hawks's major contributions now seem literary. He edited the single volume Appletons' Cyclopaedia of Biography (1856), which added American biographies to the volume edited by Elihu Rich and published in 1854 by Richard Griffin & Company (London). Hawks' church history works remain important today. After being named the Episcopal Church's historiographer in 1835, Hawks traveled to England and collected materials afterwards utilized in his Contributions to the Ecclesiastical History of U.S.A. (New York, 1836‚Äì1839). The first two volumes dealt with Maryland and Virginia, while two later ones (1863, 1864) were devoted to Connecticut. Early life and career Hawks was born in New Bern, North Carolina. He graduated from the state university, now known as the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in 1815, where he was a member of the Philanthropic Society. He then entered the practice of law. He represented New Bern in the North Carolina House of Commons in 1821.North Carolina Manual of 1913 Hawks also became active in the Episcopal Church, where he took the post of lay reader of his parish. Hawks felt drawn to the ministryWright 37. and entered the tutelage of Bishop John Stark Ravenscroft. Hawks quickly climbed the church ranks, becoming deacon in 1827 and assistant minister of Trinity parish in New Haven, Connecticut, a short while later. His preaching was widely praised, and in short order, he was ordained a priest. His next post was as assistant to Bishop White of St. James' Church in Philadelphia. He next took a position as Professor of Divinity at Washington College (now Trinity College) in Hartford, Connecticut. Rectorships In 1831, Hawks took his first church appointment, as rector of St. Stephen's Church on the corner of Broome and Chrystie streets in New York City. There his sermons attracted a large congregation. On 4 October, a mere nine months since he had moved to St. Stephens', the congregation of nearby St. Thomas Church called upon him to take over as their rector. The position offered $1,500 in annual salary with an additional $500 for other expenses.Wright 36. Hawks turned the offer down. St. Thomas did not give up, and Hawks eventually accepted their offer on 17 December, becoming the third rector for St. Thomas Church. Hawks's new church experienced a boom in membership after his arrival. Much of the congregation of St. Stephen's followed him to the new post, and many more congregants began attending as Hawks's fame for oratory spread. Eventually, the church had to be expanded with a gallery to contain the overflow. Hawks's Bible classes had an average attendance of 100 students. Philip Hone, ex-mayor of New York City, spoke for many when he wrote, \\"I went yesterday morning to St. Thomas' where I heard from Dr. Hawks a glorious sermon.\\"Hone, Philip (1936). Diary entry for 26 August 1836. The Diary of Philip Hone: 1828-1851. Allan Nevins, ed. New York: Dodd, Mead and Co., p. 418. Quoted in Wright 37-8. Praise came from other clergymen, as well. Bishop Thomas March Clark of Rhode Island wrote: > To hear him preach was like listening to the harmonies of a grand organ with > its various stops and solemn sub-bass and tremulous pathetic reeds. The > rector of one of the Washington churches, where Daniel Webster was an > attendant, told me that after Dr. Hawks had preached for him on a Sunday > morning, Mr. Webster said that it was the greatest sermon he had ever > heard.Clark, Thomas March (1895). Reminiscences, 2nd ed. New York: Thomas > Whittaker, p. 36. Quoted in Wright 38. In 1833, Hawks's salary rose to $3000 with an additional $500 allowed for other expenditures;Wright 40. this made him the highest paid clergyman in the United States.Garnet 200. He also received an assistant rector for St. Thomas. He was elected bishop of the Southwestern region in 1835, but he declined the post, citing a lack of support for his family in what was then the American frontier.  Additional church work  Hawks continued to participate in other church affairs, as well. In 1832, he was appointed assistant secretary to the House of Deputies of the General Convention of the Episcopal Church. In 1833, he took a part-time post as Professor of Ecclesiastical History and Pulpit Eloquence at the General Theological Seminary. The following year, Hawks was named secretary of the New York diocesan convention in New York City. Church history was another of Hawks's interests, and his writings are an important source on the early American church.Wright 39. In 1835, the General Convention named Hawks \\"Conservator of all books, pamphlets and manuscripts of this church.\\"Quoted in Wright 39. Hawks's interest in history led him to London in 1835. There he copied important historical documents, which he used as material for a two-volume work on the church history of Maryland and Virginia. He also wrote some nine titles under the pen name \\"Uncle Philip\\" for the publishers Harper & Brothers, which appeared in their Harper's Boy's and Girl's Library imprint series.Harris 2. While in London Hawks met the American traveller John Lloyd Stephens, later to be renowned for his exploratory work and investigations of a number of mostly-unknown ancient ruins of the pre- Columbian Maya civilization in Central America. Stephens had just completed a nine-month tour of Egypt and the Levant, and several letters describing his travels had been published in an American periodical. His acquaintance with Hawks encouraged Stephens to write a book on his Middle Eastern adventures, which was a popular success.Harris 2, 4. It sold by one account 21,000 copies in two years. Sixteen years later, Hawks wrote Stephens' obituary, as the adventurer died at age 47 from a liver illness, the article appeared in the first issue of Putnam's Monthly Magazine.\\"The Late John L. Stephens\\" (1853). Putnam's Monthly Magazine of American Literature, Science and Art. 1(1):pp.64‚Äì68. In keeping with a general fashion of the time Hawks's name does not appear in the publication itself; his identification as author is in Harris 2. He noted how \\"[i]n repeated conversations with the present writer, the attention of Mr. Stephens was [first] called to the ruins of Guatemala and Yucatan\\";\\"The Late John L. Stephens\\", p.67. the two books Stephens had later written on his explorations of that region are regarded as foundational works in the then-young science of American archaeology. Hawks continued to write and publish on general church affairs.In 1837, he partnered with fellow priest Caleb S. Henry to put out a magazine called the New York Review.Some numbers styled it New-York Review. The publication, a response to the Unitarian North American Review, published until 1842.OCLC entries for \\"New York Review\\" He helped start The Church Record, a journal of Christian education, in 1843, and in 1853 The Church Journal. In 1851, Hawks had accepted the post of Historiographer of the Protestant Episcopal Church, and held it until his death. Scandal and later life In late 1838, Hawks became one of many targets of a trend among the American penny press to expose alleged vices of holy men. The accuser was George Washington Dixon, a man known for his blackface music act, who claimed that Hawks was engaging in sexual affairs.Cockrell 116. Hawks charged Dixon with libel on 31 December 1838. After a heated trial, Dixon pled guilty on 10 and 11 May 1839. The reasons for this remain a mystery, though Dale Cockrell surmised that Hawks did not want to face further defamation of character in trial and may have paid Dixon off. Dixon claimed so in 1841.18 December 1841 The New York Flash. Quoted in Cockrell 127. Even mainstream newspapers had begun to turn on him by this point. The New York Herald wrote that \\"[he] may explain and explain till doomsday‚Äîbut these facts and their inferences [will] adhere.\\"27 April 1839 New York Weekly Herald. Quoted in Cockrell 127. Another scandal erupted closer to home. Hawks had opened a boys' school in 1839 in Flushing, Queens. The school had financial difficulties and was failing within three years, and Hawks was accused of mismanaging the funds. This proved one scandal too many. Hawks resigned from St. Thomas Church on 21 October 1843. Over the next decade, Hawks bounced from church to church. He first moved to a church in Holly Springs, Mississippi, on the American frontier and far from the disgrace of New York.Cockrell 127. There he went to work starting another school. At the Mississippi Diocesan Convention of 1844, Hawks took center stage due primarily to his endeavors to create a Diocesan school. When the Convention called for the election of the Diocese's first bishop, Hawks was tapped.\\"Journal of the Proceedings of the Nineteenth Annual Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the Diocese of Mississippi.\\" 1844 His episcopal confirmation at the General Convention was protested, with James Quarterman, a painter from Flushing, alleging that Hawks had over $100,000 in outstanding debt due to financial mismanagement at St. Thomas.Quarterman, James. \\"A Narrative of Facts, upon which is based a Protest Against the Consecration of the Rev. Dr. Hawks.\\" Philadelphia: Isaac Moss, 1844. Though Hawks successfully defended himself and the General Convention expressed their support for him, they discharged his consent back to the Diocese of Mississippi.General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church, 1832-1844, Journals and Canons In the end, Hawks turned the post down. He instead moved to Christ Church in New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1847, he was named the first president of the University of Louisiana, known today as Tulane University. Then in 1849, he returned to New York City to pastor Calvary Church. He stayed there until 1862. Hawks declined most non-clerical appointments during his time at Calvary, including an election to the Rhode Island episcopate in 1852 and a professorship at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1859. He continued to write, and in 1855 and 1856 he co-authored the Narrative of the Expedition of an American Squadron to the China Seas and Japan with Commodore Matthew Perry. During the American Civil War, Hawks moved to Christ Church in Baltimore, Maryland. By 1861 he was editing again, this time with William Stevens Perry on the Journal of the General Conventions. He began as editor of Documentary History of the Protestant Episcopal Church in 1863 and held the post until 1864. He later gave the endowment for St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery Chair of Ecclesiastical History at the General Seminary. He returned once more to New York City in 1865, where he helped to start the Chapel of the Holy Saviour on 25th Street. Another project was a Spanish-speaking church called Iglesia de Santiago, where Hawks preached on occasion. Hawks died on 26 September 1866. After a funeral at Calvary Church, he was buried at Christ Church in Greenwich, Connecticut.

Early life Born in Kilmore, Victoria, Tyrrell was educated at Orbost and Mordialloc and Melbourne Boys' High Schools. He married Ellen (Nell) St Clair Greig on 6 May 1939. They had three children, two daughters born first, Leonie Ellen and Margot Evelyn, and then a son, Michael St Clair. Career He served for over 45 years in the Australian Public Service. For most of this time he was assistant secretary or personal secretary to a succession of Ministers including the Prime Minister, Ben Chifley.

He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1959. Both of these honours occurred during Sir William Slim's term.Official Secretary to Governor-General Tyrrell had a small but pivotal role to play in the establishment of the Australian Conservation Foundation. The ACF began in the second half of 1964, after a suggestion was made to Tyrrell by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh while visiting Australia in 1963. He voiced an idea that Australia could become involved in conservation by establishing a branch of the World Wildlife Fund. Tyrrell convened a meeting that came to the conclusion that, if a conservation body was to exist, its efforts should be directed at conserving Australia's own heritage. From this the ACF emerged. Murray Tyrrell was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in 1968, during Lord Casey's term. This was awarded for personal service to the Queen, and was not on recommendation from the Prime Minister.

Business Week. September 18, 2006. Although the company's pay for management trainees was among the lowest on the list (at an average $34,000), \\"those who catch on\\" quickly get a chance to run a branch office with the responsibility to generate a profit. Certain requirements and qualifications must be met to get promoted to an assistant manager, and many of these qualifications may depend on the employees' sales and their success in the company's management training program. According to BusinessWeek's list of \\"Best Places to Launch a Career\\", Enterprise was in the top 15. Within five years, a successful manager may take positions at headquarters or become an area manager responsible for multiple branches. The ERAC system earns revenue through the \\"average car rate\\". The vehicles range from small vehicles reserved for insurance replacement, paid for at negotiated insured rates, to high end luxury vehicles that rent in upwards of 3 figures. The goal is to up-sell the customer into vehicles of higher perceived value even though the investment in the vehicle inventory is spread across all vehicles. In addition to renting vehicles, Enterprise sells vehicles that are displaced from its fleet at used car dealerships nationwide as Enterprise Car Sales. https://www.enterprisecarsales.com/ Controversies =Safety= During model years 2006-2008, 66,000 of the Chevrolet Impalas the company ordered were purchased without side-curtain airbags, saving the company $11.5 million ($175 per vehicle), though the airbags were standard in retail models. The practice, which the company notes does not \\"violate any federal mandate\\", came to national attention when cars being retired from their rental fleet were sold with claims that side-curtain air bags were included. About 5,000 Chevrolet Cobalts and Buick LaCrosses were also purchased with the side air bags omitted. Enterprise admitted that it inaccurately advertised and sold 745 Chevrolet Impalas‚Äîmodel years 2006 through 2008‚Äîthat were identified online as having side air bags, when in fact they did not. A company spokesman said that it would inform customers who had bought the cars, and offer to buy them back from the customers. According to Safety Research and Strategies, a safety research firm that regularly works with the automotive industry, deleting safety features is a highly unusual practice. \\"I‚Äôve never seen a standard safety feature removed from a vehicle. I‚Äôve been doing this work for 17 years and, until now, had yet to see this happen,‚Äù said Sean Kane of Safety Research and Strategies. =Slogans= In August 1998, Enterprise took legal action against car rental competitors Hertz and Advantage in regards to similarities between the companies' slogans. In 1994, Enterprise adopted the slogan \\"We'll pick you up.\\" Four years later, the company felt that Hertz and Advantage were using slogans at the time that imitated its own too closely. Hertz rejected the claim, with the company's assistant general counsel David Parkoff saying Hertz, \\"believes that it can use the English language words 'we'll pick you up' and their variants in a descriptive/informational sense as it presently does and that Enterprise's claim of trademark rights in those words is misplaced and does not prevent such use.\\" Months before, in May, a judge ruling ordered the Rent-a-Wreck of America rental agency to stop using slogans containing the phrase \\"pick you up.\\" =Portland Black Lives Matter protests= In late July of 2020 license plate checks carried out by a local newspaper revealed that at least one vehicle registered to EAN Holdings LLC was being used by Federal Police or vigilantes to legally detain rioters in Portland, Oregon.

History The gorge is named after the clipper ship Loch Ard, which ran aground on nearby Muttonbird Island on 1 June 1878 approaching the end of a three-month journey from England to Melbourne. Of the fifty-four passengers and crew, only two survived: Tom Pearce, at 19 years of age, a ship's apprentice, and Eva Carmichael, an Irishwoman emigrating with her family, at 19 years of age. According to memorials at the site, Pearce was washed ashore, and rescued Carmichael from the water after hearing her cries for help. Pearce then proceeded to climb out of the gorge to raise the alarm to local pastoralists who immediately set into plan a rescue attempt. After three months in Australia Carmichael returned to Europe. Four of her family members drowned that night. Pearce was hailed as a hero, and continued his life living until age 49. He is buried in Southampton, England. Cemetery for the Loch Ard passengers The arch of the nearby Island Archway collapsed in June 2009. The feature now appears as two unconnected rock pillars. They have since been officially named Tom and Eva after the two teenage survivors of the Loch Ard shipwreck.

He has appeared in a series of books known as The Renquist Quartet. Profile Born in the twelfth century, the illegitimate son of a nobleman, Victor Renquist grows up to become a sword for hire. When in his forties, he works for a breakaway Christian sect known as the Cathars during their hopeless last stand against the forces of Pope Innocent III, in which he is mortally wounded. To save his life, the Cathars call upon an entity known as Lamia the Great Vampire, who makes, or \\"turns\\" him to a vampire as well. During the intervening centuries, Renquist survives not only on blood, but also by accepting jobs for various political and intelligence agencies. He has reputedly works for the Duke of Wellington, Nicholas II of Russia, and the NSA. Along the way, he has evaded capture by the Spanish Inquisition, the Knights of Sebastopol and the Gestapo. As a vampire, he is faster, stronger, and hardier than a human. He is also able to read minds, brainwash and hypnotize people. He is vulnerable to radioactivity, both from natural (the Sun) and unnatural sources (such as nuclear devices). As their leader, he lives with at least four other vampires in a \\"colony\\" of vampires in an isolated residence in California. Through the series, we are told of how vampires evolved from a warrior class created by an alien race called the Nephilim. The Nephilim conquered Earth millennia ago and tinkered with the primitive humans to create two classes: warrior (Nosferatu) and administrator (Urshuu). However, the Nephilim left Earth in antiquity, leaving their creations behind. Over the course of the books, Renquist clashes with, variously, the Old God Cthulhu, the vampire Clan, Fenrior, members of his own colony, a Nazi society living in caverns under the ground (in an environment which is supposed to be the basis of the Hollow Earth), the mythic magician Merlin, a cult known as The Apogee, and the Dhrakuh, an ancient race of sentient reptiles (who it is implied are the basis of dragon legends).

The Indo Sri Lanka Agreement. Satyendra N. Tamil NationText of the Peace accord.Tamil Nation Importantly however, the Tamil groups, notably the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) (which at the time was one of the strongest Tamil forces), had not been made party to the talks and initially agreed to surrender their arms to the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) only reluctantly. Within a few months however, this flared into an active confrontation. The LTTE declared their intent to continue the armed struggle for an independent Tamil Eelam and refused to disarm. The IPKF found itself engaged in a bloody police action against the LTTE. Further complicating the return to peace started a Insurgency in the south of the island. Background Location of Sri Lanka Sri Lanka, from the early part of the 1980s, was facing an increasingly violent ethnic strife. The origins of this conflict can be traced to the independence of the island from Britain in 1948. At the time, a Sinhala majority government was instituted which passed legislation that were deemed discriminatory against the substantial Tamil minority population. In the 1970s, two major Tamil parties united to form the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) that started agitation for a separate state of Tamil Eelam within the system in a federal structure in the north and eastern Sri Lanka that would grant the Tamils greater autonomy. However, enactment of the sixth amendment of the Sri Lankan Constitution in August 1983 classified all separatist movements as unconstitutional,The Peace Accord and the Tamils in Sri Lanka.Hennayake S.K. Asian Survey, Vol. 29, No. 4. (Apr., 1989), pp. 401‚Äì415. effectively rendering the TULF ineffective. Outside the TULF, however, factions advocating more radical and militant courses of action soon emerged, and the ethnic divisions started flaring into a violent civil war. Indian involvement According to Rejaul Karim Laskar, a scholar of Indian foreign policy, Indian intervention in Sri Lankan civil war became inevitable as that civil war threatened India's \\"unity, national interest and territorial integrity.\\" According to Laskar, this threat came in two ways: On the one hand external powers could take advantage of the situation to establish their base in Sri Lanka thus posing a threat to India, on the other hand, the LTTE's dream of a sovereign Tamil Eelam comprising all the Tamil-inhabited areas (of Sri Lanka and India) posed a threat to India's territorial integrity. India had, initially under Indira GandhiIndia's search for power:Indira Gandhi's Foreign Policy.1966‚Äì1982. Mansingh S. New Delhi:Sage 1984. p282 and later under Rajiv Gandhi, provided support to Tamil interests from the very conception of the secessionist movement. This included providing sanctuary to the separatists, as well as support the operations training camps for Tamil guerrillas in Tamil NaduIndia's Regional Security Doctrine. Hagerty D.T. Asian Survey, Vol. 31, No. 4. (Apr., 1991), pp. 351‚Äì363 of which the LTTE emerged as the strongest force. This was both as a result of a large Tamil community in South India, as well as India's regional security and interests which attempted to reduce the scope of foreign intervention, especially those linked to the United States, Pakistan, and China. To this end, the Indira Gandhi government sought to make it clear to Sri Lankan President J. R. Jayewardene that armed intervention in support of the Tamil movement was an option India would consider if any diplomatic solutions should fail. Following the anti- Tamil riots, the Tamil rebel movement grew progressively strong and increasingly violent. However, after Indira Gandhi's assassination, the Indian support for the militant movement decreased. However, the succeeding Rajiv Gandhi government attempted to re-establish friendly relations with its neighbours. It still however maintained diplomatic efforts to find a solution to the conflict as well as maintaining covert aid to the Tamil rebels. From 1985 however, the Sri-Lankan Government started rearming itself extensively for its anti-insurgent role with support from Pakistan, Israel, Singapore and South Africa.\\"The Colombo Chill\\". Bobb, D. India Today. March 31, 1986. p95. In 1986, the campaign against the insurgency was stepped up and in 1987, retaliating an increasingly bloody insurgent movement, Operation Liberation was launched against LTTE strongholds in Jaffna Peninsula, involving nearly four thousand troops, supported by helicopter gunships as well as ground attack aircraft. In June 1987, the Sri Lankan Army laid siege on the town of Jaffna.India Airlifts Aid to Tamil Rebels\\", The New York Times. 5 June 1987 As civilian casualties grew,Sri Lanka in 1987: Indian Intervention and Resurgence of the JVP.

India, which had a substantial Tamil population in South India faced the prospect of a Tamil backlash at home, called on the Sri Lankan government to halt the offensive in an attempt to negotiate a political settlement. However, the Indian efforts were futile. Added to this, in the growing involvement of Pakistani and Israeli advisors, it was necessary for Indian interest to mount a show of force. Failing to negotiate an end to the crisis with Sri Lanka, India announced on 2 June 1987 that it would send a convoy of unarmed ships to northern Sri Lanka to provide humanitarian assistance\\"Indians To Send convoy to Sri Lanka\\", The New York Times. 2 June 1987 but this was intercepted by the Sri Lankan Navy and turned back.\\"Indian Flotilla is turned back by Sri Lankan Naval Vessels\\", The New York Times. 4 June 1987 Following the failure of the naval mission, the decision was made by the Indian government to mount an airdrop of relief supplies in support of rebel forces over the besieged city of Jaffna. On 4 June 1987, in a blatant show of force, the Indian Air Force mounted Operation Poomalai in broad daylight. Five An-32s of the Indian Air Force under cover of heavily armed Indian fighter jets flew over Jaffna to airdrop 25 tons of supplies, all the time keeping well within the range of Sri Lankan radar coverage. At the same time the Sri Lankan Ambassador to New Delhi was summoned to the Foreign Office to be informed by the Minister of External Affairs, K. Natwar Singh, of the ongoing operation. It was also indicated to the ambassador that if the operation was in any way hindered by Sri Lanka, India would launch a full-force military retaliation against Sri Lanka.\\"Indian Air Force in Sri Lanka.Operation Poomalai ‚Äì The Jaffna Food drop.\\" Bharat- rakshak.com The ultimate aim of the operation was both to demonstrate the credibility of the Indian option of active intervention to the Sri Lankan Government, as a symbolic act of support for the Tamil Rebels, as well to preserve Rajiv Gandhi's credibility.\\"Operation Poomalai ‚Äì India Intervenes\\" Bharat-rakshak.com Faced with the possibility of an active Indian intervention and facing an increasingly war-weary population at home,\\"Sri Lanka's Ethnic Conflict: The Indo-Lanka Peace Accord\\".

Jayewardene, offered to hold talks with the Rajiv Gandhi government on future moves. The siege of Jaffna was soon lifted, followed by a round of negotiations that led to the signing of the Indo-Sri-Lankan accord on July 29, 1987 that brought a temporary truce. The terms of the truce specified that the Sri Lankan troops withdraw from the north and the Tamil rebels disarm, and saw the induction of the Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka. Peace accord Among the salient points of the agreement, the Sri Lankan Government made a number of concessions to Tamil demands, which included Colombo devolution of power to the provinces, merger (subject to later referendum) of the northern and eastern provinces, and official status for the Tamil language. More immediately, Operation Liberation ‚Äî the successful, ongoing anti-insurgent operation by Sri Lankan forces in the Northern peninsula ‚Äî was ended. Sri Lankan troops were to withdraw to their barracks in the north, the Tamil rebels were to disarm.India agreed to end support for the Tamil separatist movement and recognise the unity of Sri Lanka. The Indo-Sri Lanka Accord also underlined the commitment of Indian military assistance on which the IPKF came to be inducted into Sri Lanka. In 1990, India withdrew the last of its forces from Sri Lanka, and fighting between the LTTE and the government resumed. In January 1995, the Sri Lankan Government and the LTTE agreed to a ceasefire as a preliminary step in a government-initiated plan for peace negotiations. After 3 months, however, the LTTE unilaterally resumed hostilities. The government of Sri Lanka then adopted a policy of military engagement with the Tigers, with government forces liberating Jaffna from LTTE control by mid-1996 and moving against LTTE positions in the northern part of the country called the Vanni. An LTTE counteroffensive, begun in October 1999, reversed most government gains; and by May 2000, threatened government forces in Jaffna. Heavy fighting continued into 2001. =Reaction= On the eve of the signing of the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord, Rajiv Gandhi was assaulted by Leading Rate Vijitha Rohana at the Guard of Honour held for Gandhi in what seemed an attempted assassination. Four years later, in 1991, Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by a LTTE suicide bomber. This radically reduced support for the LTTE within India. In 2009, 19 years after his assassination, the Sri Lankan army mounted a major military offensive in the north and eradicated the LTTE. The operation was not opposed by India and received Indian diplomatic and military support, despite condemnations from state of Tamil Nadu and Western nations for alleged human rights violations. Rajiv Gandhi's widow, Sonia Gandhi was the chairperson of India's ruling coalition at the time. =Books= *Ramakrishnan, T.

He served as President of the Institution of Civil Engineers 1862-63. His most noteworthy work is the Severn Tunnel. Early life He was born in Leeds, Yorkshire, the son of Henry Hawkshaw, and was educated at Leeds Grammar School. Before he was 21 he had been engaged for six or seven years in railway engineering and the construction of roads in his native county, and in the year of his majority he obtained an appointment as engineer to the Bolivar Mining Association in Venezuela. But the climate there was more than his health could stand, and in 1834 he was obliged to return to England. Career He soon obtained employment under Jesse Hartley at the Liverpool docks, and subsequently was made engineer in charge of the railway and navigation works of the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal Company. In 1845 he became chief engineer to the Manchester and Leeds Railway, and in 1847 to its successor, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway for which he constructed a large number of branch lines. One such was the Manchester and Southport line surveyed by his associate Clement Wilks and as well as the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway near Heckmondwike. In 1850 he moved to London and began to practice as a consulting engineer, at first alone, but subsequently in partnership with Harrison Hayter. In that capacity his work was of an extremely varied nature, embracing almost every branch of engineering. He retained his connection with the Lancashire & Yorkshire Company until his retirement from professional work in 1888, and was consulted on all the important engineering points that affected it in that long period. In London he was responsible for the Charing Cross and Cannon Street railways, together with the two bridges which carried them over the Thames; he was engineer of the East London railway, which passes under the Thames through Sir Marc Brunel's well-known tunnel; and jointly with Sir J Wolfe-Barry he constructed the section of the Underground railway which completed the inner circle between the Aldgate and Mansion House stations. In addition, many railway works claimed his attention in all parts of the world‚ÄîGermany, Russia, India, Mauritius, etc. One noteworthy point in his railway practice was his advocacy, in opposition to Robert Stephenson, of steeper gradients than had previously been thought desirable or possible, and so far back as 1838 he expressed decided disapproval of the maintenance of the broad gauge on the Great Western, because of the troubles he foresaw it would lead to in connection with future railway extension, and because he objected in general to breaks of gauge in the lines of a country. The construction of canals was another branch of engineering in which he was actively engaged. In 1862 he became engineer of the Amsterdam ship-canal, and in the succeeding year he may fairly be said to have been the saviour of the Suez Canal. About that time the scheme was in very bad odour, and the khedive determined to get the opinion of an English engineer as to its practicability, having made up his mind to stop the works if that opinion was unfavourable. Hawkshaw was chosen to make the inquiry, and it was because his report was entirely favourable that Ferdinand de Lesseps was able to say at the opening ceremony that to him he owed the canal. As a member of the International Congress which considered the construction of an inter-ocean canal across Central America, he thought best of the Nicaragua route, and privately he regarded the Panama scheme as impracticable at a reasonable cost, although publicly he expressed no opinion on the matter and left the Congress without voting. Sir John Hawkshaw also had a wide experience in constructing harbours (e.g. Holyhead) and docks (e.g. Penarth, the Albert Dock at Hull, and South Dock (formerly the City Canal) of the West India Docks in London), in river-engineering, in drainage and sewerage, in water-supply, etc. Sir John Hawkshaw (in cart) inspecting the Severn Tunnel during its construction He was engineer, with Sir James Brunlees, of the original Channel Tunnel Company from 1872, but many years previously he had investigated for himself the question of a tunnel under the Strait of Dover from an engineering point of view, and had come to a belief in its feasibility, so far as that could be determined from borings and surveys. Subsequently, however, he became convinced that the tunnel would not be to the advantage of Great Britain, and thereafter would have nothing to do with the project. He was also consulting engineer to the Severn Tunnel, which, from its magnitude and the difficulties encountered in its construction, was one of the most notable engineering undertakings of the 19th century. Following the inundation of the tunnel working in 1879, he employed Thomas A. Walker as lead contractor to complete the work. He also designed the famous Puerto Madero, the port of Buenos Aires, collaborating with Thomas A. Walker and James Murray Dobson. The works started its construction in 1885 and was finished in 1898. He is also known for his construction of the Brighton sewerage system.http://www.coastaldrains.co.uk/history-brighton-sewage-system/ Family In 1835 he married Ann Jackson (d.1885). Ann and John had six children: Mary Jane Jackson (1838), Ada (1840), John Clarke (1841), Henry Paul (1843), Editha (1845), and Oliver (1846). Ada died of hydrocephalus in 1845. Oliver died in 1856 having contracted typhoid fever whilst the family were holidaying in Pitlochry, Scotland. His son, John Clarke was also a civil engineer. He died in London on 2 June 1891. Honours and awards He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1855. In 1875, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were David Stevenson, James Leslie, Thomas Stevenson and Henry Charles Fleeming Jenkin.http://archives.wellcomelibrary.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp;=Archive&dsqCmd;=Show.tcl&dsqDb;=Catalog&dsqPos;=33&dsqSearch;=(Sources_guides_used%3D'Tropical%20Medicine') He served as president of the Institution of Civil Engineers between December 1861 and December 1863. He was knighted in 1873. He was elected an honorary member of the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1880.

It is a sub-prefecture of the department. Geography Saint-Di√© is located in the Vosges Mountains southeast of Nancy and of Lun√©ville. This route in the valley of Meurthe was always the more frequented, and first to get a rail line in 1864, so now it accommodates the primary road. Saint-Di√©-des-Vosges, principal town of an arrondissement of the same name, belongs to the Vosges d√©partement of France. This commune with a little town in her center, is approximately northeast of √âpinal, and connected by two roads, south through the passes of Haut-Jacques and Bruy√®res or north by the pass of Haut-du-Bois and the ancient land of Rambervillers. By rail, √âpinal is ] from Saint-Di√©. The river Meurthe flows in the Permian basin of Saint-Di√© surrounded by wooded mountains, Ormont, Kemberg and La Madeleine. The peaks of these mountains are high, and are composed of Triassic formations, especially the so-called \\"Vosges sandstone\\", a kind of red sandstone. Features The town was nearly completely redesigned and rebuilt in the French Uniform Style after the fire of 1757. A major part was destroyed in November, 1944 and was rebuilt largely in a material imitating red sandstone. Its cathedral has a Gothic nave and choir designed in the 14th century; the portal of red stone was created by Giovanni Betto in the beginning of the 18th century. A cloister, begun in the 14th century but never finished, contains a stone pulpit, and connects with the Petite-Eglise or Notre-Dame-de-Galil√©e, a well-preserved specimen of Romanesque architecture of the 12th century. All of the monuments were restored or rebuilt in the same manner after 1950. Since 1880, the Council House\\"Mairie\\" has held a marvelous theater, a library with some old and valuable manuscripts, a reading hall and a museum of rocks and antiquities collected by the members of the Vosges Philomatic Society. This society, which engaged in the collection and diffusion of knowledge, was founded in 1875 by Henry Bardy, who was soon an editor of the first local republican paper named La Gazette Vosgiennne. All this center of town was destroyed in November 1944. After 1948, a new h√¥tel-de-ville was built to the west. At its west side there is now a monument by Merci to Jules Ferry, long ago in an old union place under the Cathedral. Born in the town in 1832, Jules Ferry was a great French politician of the conservative Republic, constitutionally called Third Republic in 1875. After World War II, the right side of the Meurthe was completely razed and most people lived outside the town in wood cabins for decades. The radical plan created by Le Corbusier in 1945, which called for a large plaza with factories and other buildings in the heart of the city, was rejected in 1947, and only one private factory belonging to Jean-Jacques Duval was ever built. There were no means nor materials in this terrible period and the great street called \\"rue Thiers\\" was finished only at the end of 1954. Economy The town was industrial in nature long before the local economy reaped the benefits from a migration of Alsatians, who arrived after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871. Its industries included the spinning, weaving and bleaching of cotton, wire-drawing, metal-founding, the manufacture of hosiery, woodwork of various kinds (toleware), machinery, iron goods and wire screen. Since the world wars, major industrial activities have declined precipitously. Now the town is primarily a center of public services, educational institutions, a hospital, and businesses in the service industries, such as supermarkets. History Saint-Di√© (Deodatum, Theodata, S. Deodati Fanum) is named for Saint Deodat. This holy man, or \\"le bonhomme\\", founded a ban, a political and Christian subdivision of the royal territory, originally called \\"foresta\\" in the 7th century. Old religious historians believed he was the episcopus of Nevers, Deodatus of Nevers. Deodatus gave up his episcopal functions to retire to a desert place. Some sources connect the name, however, with an earlier saint, Deodatus of Blois (d. 525). Archeology and historic records confirms the length of time that this area has been occupied by people. One hypothesis holds that a column constructed by Romans, in a locus originally dedicated to Tiwaz, Tius, god of war, may explain ancient ceremonies in the old saint-Di√© chapel, under the Kemberg mountain locally called Saint-Martin. Deodatus, who might have been a hiberniensis pope ‚Äì and not a niverniensis pope, or a bishop from Nevers ‚Äì would have lived in an old monastery or \\"vieux moutier\\" above this old chapelle and water. Legends originating in the 11th century and popular traditions say Saint Di√© dreamed of a new monastery in a little hill called \\"monticule des Jointures\\" in the other side of the river he could see. A little monastic community dedicated to saint Maurice, was probably founded during Carolingian times, as there is evidence of its presence since the 10th century. After 1006, the monastery took the name Saint-Di√©. The little monastery was partially destroyed by fire in 1065 and in 1155. The date on which it became a chapter of canons is uncertain. Historians deny Brunon de Dabo-Egisheim, future Pope Leo IX, was a young monk and great provost here, but his family played a great role in the elevated status of this religious place, giving their blazon after the first crusades. Canons who subsequently held the rank of provost or dean came from very rich and noble families, among those Giovanni de Medici and several princes coming from the ducal House of Lorraine. Among the extensive privileges enjoyed by them was that of coining money; the Duchy of Lorraine was the last to hold this privilege in 1601. Though they co-operated in building the town walls in 1290, the canons and the dukes of Lorraine soon became rivals for the authority over Saint-Di√©. The institution of a town council in 1628 which appropriated part of their temporal jurisdiction, in addition to numerous French occupations, diminished the financial influence of the canons. During the Stanislas reign and after the Lorraine annexation in 1776, the establishment in 1777 of a bishopric condemned the venerable institution, with the first bishop Monseigneur de Chaumont. With the French Revolution all the religious people were completely swept away. The town was repeatedly sacked during the wars of the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. The little but religiously very prestigious town was partially destroyed by fire in 1554 and 1757. Funds for the rebuilding of the portion of the town destroyed by the last fire were supplied by Stanislas, last duke of Lorraine. Ecclesiastical history The diocese of Saint-Di√© was created in 1777, but suppressed by the Concordat of 1801. It was restored in 1822 as a suffragan of the Diocese of Besan√ßon covering the department of the Vosges, of which 18 parishes were transferred to the Diocese of Strasbourg in 1871. The diocese of Saint-Di√© originated in the celebrated abbey, initially named \\"Galil√©e\\", and was established by Saint Deodatus (Di√©) in the 7th century, around which the town of Saint-Di√© grew up. The Benedictines of the original foundation Saint Maurice were replaced in 996 by Augustinian Canons. During the sixteenth century, and the long vacancy of the see of Toul, the abbots of the several monasteries in the Vosges, without actually declaring themselves independent of the diocese of Toul, claimed to exercise a quasi-episcopal jurisdiction. In 1718, the Bishop of Toul requested the creation of a see at Saint-Di√©, but the suggestion was opposed by the King of France. The see was eventually created by Pope Pius VI in 1777 by the elevation of the abbey of Saint-Di√© into a bishopric. The new diocese was removed from the diocese of Toul and made instead a suffragan of the German Archdiocese of Trier. Cosmography Vautrin Lud, Canon of St-Di√© in charge of the mines of the valleys was the chaplain and secretary of Ren√© II, Duke of Lorraine. He set up a printing- establishment at St-Di√© and facilitated reflections on the theme of earth representation and also met with what would today be called geographers, the German cartographer Martin Waldseem√ºller, and the Alsatian professor Matthias Ringmann and clever Canons. The team began at once to produce an edition of a Latin translation of Ptolemy's \\"Geography\\". In 1507, Ren√© II received the Soderini Letter from Lisbon, an abridged account of the four voyages of Amerigo Vespucci. Canon Lud had this translated into Latin by Basin de Sandaucourt. The translation dedicated to the Emperor Maximilian was completed at St-Di√© on 24 April 1507; it was prefaced by a short explanatory booklet, entitled Cosmographiae Introductio, certainly the work of Waldseem√ºller, an introduction to cosmography that can be seen as the baptismal certificate of the New Continent. Indeed, Waldseem√ºller and the scholars of the Gymnasium Vosagense then made a capital decision writing: \\"...And since Europe and Asia received names of women, I do not see any reason not to call this latest discovery Amerige, or America, according to the sagacious man who discovered it\\". The first and second printings appeared in August 1507 at St-Di√©, a third at Strassburg in 1509, and thus the name of America was spread about. Thus, Saint-Di√©-des-Vosges is honored today with the title of \\"godmother of America\\", the city that named America. The work was re-edited with an English version by Charles Herbermann (New York, 1907). Gallois proved that in 1507, Waldseem√ºller inserted this name in two maps, but that in 1513, in other maps Waldseem√ºller, being better informed, inserted the name of Columbus as the discoverer of America. But it was too late; the name of America had been already firmly established. In 1507, Martin Waldseem√ºller produced in St-Di√© also a world globe bearing the first use of the name \\"America\\".

Curlee is a guitar manufacturer originating in Matteson, Illinois and presently in central Texas. Peak years were 1977 to 1981 before ceasing production until 2011. For a while its electric basses were popular, much more so than their guitars. They were exported and especially popular in Belgium and Germany during the original run.  History  This company founded by musician/businessman Randy Curlee, instrument designer Randy Dritz and pattern maker Sonny Storbeck in 1975 in Matteson, IL. The name S.D Curlee came from the three original partners: Storbeck, Dritz and Curlee. Production began in early 1976 and ceased in 1982. Officially, the company manufactured around 15,000 instruments, though this is disputed amongst the company founders. Curlee wanted to offer a quality-built instrument at an affordable price. Advertising campaigns were focused on Guitar Player. An classy 8-page color brochure from 1979 was produced along with multiple color ads originally placed in the magazine. During these years, the Curlee brand was applied to Curlee-arranged import versions and was also licensed to Hondo. S.D. Curlee was one of the first instrument manufacturers to use this approach to address the issue of unlicensed copies of premium brands. Other instrument companies subsequently followed its lead, such as Fender's Squier brand of Asian- manufactured products and Gibson's use of its Epiphone brand. This business model has become a standard both to gain a share in the copy market and also provide customers with a more budget-oriented version of a higher-priced instrument. During the early 1980s the climate for these 'all natural' instruments changed drastically. Headless designs, flashy colors and an altogether different approach inspired Curlee to branch out and offer flashy, painted guitars reminiscent of the original version. Combined with a recession and internal business decisions, the company ceased operations in 1982. Curlee's innovative designs inspired a cult following that remains active today. Randy Curlee continued in sales and marketing in the musical instrument industry, including work for Yamaha as the manager of the DGA (Drums, Guitars & Amps) Division and Peavey Guitars. He died in 2005 from complications of diabetes.  Construction  left The Curlee instruments featured a unique design blend of neck through body and a bolt-on neck, which was anchored in the body with a heavy brass plate. Most of the 1970s bass models shared the same basic, almost symmetrical shape (inspired by the Gibson Les Paul Jr. double cutaway), and were available in fretted and fretless versions. The main models were: * Standard 1 (1 P-bass DiMarzio, mahogany body, maple neck, originally equipped with a Gibson EB-like humbucker, the DiMarzio Model One, located near the bridge) * Standard 2 (identical to the above but 2 pick ups - P pickup-era only) * Butcher (body made of butcher block maple) * Liberty (liberty bell shaped body designed by Denny Rauen) * Curbeck (body made of walnut, maple stripes) * Summit (body and neck made of laminated walnut and Maple) * Yankee (active electronics, walnut body, maple neck, small upper horn/lower bout, ...sort of an 'updated'version of the Curbeck ) - released in the early 1980s. The Yankee was advertised with three different pick up configurations; 1 P-bass (Yankee I), 2-Pbass (Yankee II) and the rare Yankee II-J including 1 P-bass (bridge)/J-bass (neck). Most Yankees have a 2 p-bass pick-up set up (Yankee II). Other models and body shapes were prototyped and saw limited production. Some late \\"Curlee\\" instruments (late in the original run the brand as applied had been modified, removing the S and D) had painted bodies and set (glued in) necks. A P-bass bodied version was produced along with pointy \\"Star\\" model basses & guitars, all in very limited batches. S.D. Curlees feature hardware including Grover tuning heads; brass, Badass II or original Badass bridges; a brass nut and high output DiMarzio pickups. All basses used a 32¬Ω\\" medium scale neck. Some of the original USA basses developed truss rod issues over time. Later models introduced a German Carve body edge and aluminum instead of brass plates.  Cultural effect and availability  left Although the brand enjoys a cult-like status, only a few famous bass guitarists were seen with Curlee models in the mid- to late-1970s. Former Mahavishnu Orchestra bass guitarist Rick Laird had one, R. \\"Skeet\\" Curtis played one (and still has it) while touring with Parliament, Vincent Gallo used one in the New York City noise band Gray and Nick Lowe used a Curlee fretless on a few assignments. Jack Blades used them on the first Night Ranger album and played one on the \\"Don't tell me you love me\\" video. Alec John Such (Bon Jovi) was known to have three. Recently, guitarist Adam McIlwee of Tigers Jaw can be seen using a vintage Curlee guitar. Brandt Huseman of The Greenberry Woods, plays a vintage international Standard 1 bass. Duran Duran bass player John Taylor posted the 1980 bill for his Hondo Curlee bass on the Duran Duran website. On July 4, 2011 Scott Beckwith, owner of Birdsong Guitars, announced the resurrection of the SD Curlee instruments. The new basses are visually close to the originals but with modern hardware and upgrades. Current production is of USA basses only and is under 25 per year.

Diss. Vienna, 2001 1840), was an Austrian baritone singer and composer. Though famous in his day, he is remembered mainly for his close professional relationship and friendship with composer Franz Schubert. Vogl and Franz Schubert, caricatured by Franz von Schober Vogl was born in Steyr. As a young man he enrolled at the Gymnasium at Kremsm√ºnster, where he studied languages, philosophy, and sang in several musical productions by his friend Franz S√º√ümayr (the same man who completed Mozart's Requiem). In 1786 Vogl went to Vienna to study, and later to practice law. In 1795 he debuted at the Vienna Hofoper, and quickly attracted a following for both his acting capability and the beauty of his voice. In 1813, Franz Schubert attended a performance of Gluck's Iphig√©nie en Tauride in which Vogl sang the role of Orestes; Schubert never forgot the experience and determined to write for Vogl. The following year, when Vogl sang the role of Pizarro at the premiere of the final version of Beethoven's Fidelio, it is said that the 17-year-old Schubert actually sold his schoolbooks in order to afford a ticket. When composer and singer finally met, in 1817, Vogl was as impressed with the quality of Schubert's music as Schubert was with Vogl's singing. Schubert wrote many of his subsequent songs with Vogl in mind. One of their early successes was an 1821 performance of Der Erlk√∂nig, prior to its publication and to significant popular acclaim. Rarely in music history has the relationship of a composer and a specific singer been so musically productive. Vogl continued to sing Schubert's music after the death of his friend in 1828, famously singing a complete performance of Winterreise accompanied by the pianist Emanuel Mikschik shortly before his own death on the twelfth anniversary of the death of his friend. He died in Vienna. Literature * \\"Johann Michael Vogl\\", \\"Franz Schubert\\", in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed. Stanley Sadie. 20 vol.

It is divided into Somerset Street East and Somerset Street West by the Rideau Canal. Somerset Street East Somerset Street East is a short road that runs through the neighbourhood of Sandy Hill from the University of Ottawa campus to the west and Strathcona Park to the east. Somerset also used to extend east over the Rideau River towards St. Laurent Boulevard. However, that bridge was destroyed by flooding in 1952 and never replaced. The street was renamed Donald Street east of the river. In 2015, a new bicycle/pedestrian bridge (Ad√†we Crossing) was completed across the river on the site of the old bridge, and the street has become an important bicycle corridor between the university and downtown Ottawa. By 2017, bicycle volumes accounted for 65% of street traffic and the street was re-striped with advisory bike lanes.Alta Planning + Design, (August 2017).

Somerset Square forms the western terminus of Somerset Street, when it turns into Wellington Street West. Also known as Ottawa Road #36, Somerset Street West begins at the Queen Elizabeth Driveway in the east and continues west to Wellington Street West where it ends at Somerset Square. Somerset Street West houses the backbone of Ottawa's Chinatown, between Bay Street in the east to Preston Street in the west, which is the centre of Ottawa's Little Italy. The area of the street between Bank and O'Connor is known as Somerset Village. The Ottawa Electric Railway ran along Somerset Street West between Bank Street going west towards Britannia Park In between In the 1870s, as the area was developed, a bridge was proposed linking the two Somerset Streets over the Rideau Canal.Maclaren, J. Plan of the By Estate, 1871 However, this bridge never came into existence. Today, on the east side of the canal, there is a pedestrian link from the multi-use pathway that runs alongside the canal, across Colonel By Drive, and under Nicholas Street and the transitway, onto the University of Ottawa campus. The street continues through the campus as Marie Curie Private, with traffic restricted to bicycles in the westbound direction. The Corktown Footbridge connects the two sides, but is restricted to non-motorized traffic. The bridge opened to the public on September 21, 2006.

It is an iron block, aluminum head design with a timing belt, cheaper to make than the timing chain setup on the Z and L engines. Earlier versions featured SOHC and eight valves. The new CA block design was a scaled-up E series block with timing shaft and other ancillaries removed. The oil pump is fitted directly onto the crank nose and the distributor is driven by the end of the camshaft. Like the E series and the A block from which the E was derived, Nissan used a taller block for the largest stroked 2.0-litre engine. The CA was designed to be compact and light, with a CA16 requiring only of space (compared to for the earlier Z16), while weighing 23% less at . The engine was called the \\"CA\\" series for Clean Air, due to the installation of Nissan emission reducing technology, called NAPS-X. Later versions featured DOHC with 16 valves for increased efficiency at high engine speeds and a smoother power delivery. The hydraulic lifters are interchangeable between all DOHC RB and VG series engines excepting those with solid lifters. The motor was expensive to produce being cast iron, Production ceased in 1991. The 1.8 L and 2.0 L versions were replaced by the SR series as the primary Nissan four-cylinder engine, while the smaller 1.6 L was replaced by the GA.

The late model Japanese CA18DETs received 8 port (low port) heads, with butterfly actuated auxiliary ports in the lower intake manifold which corresponded with 8 ports in the head. Below c. 3,800 rpm, only one set (4 ports open, 1 per cylinder) of long, narrow ports would be open, accelerating the intake charge to the cylinder. This allowed for quick spool and good low- end tractability. At the 3800 rpm change over, not only would the ECCS shift into batch fire (as opposed to sequential) fuel injection, but it also opened the second set of short, wide ports (8 ports open, 2 per cylinder) which assisted in high RPM flow. This engine is known for stronger torque characteristics, as well as faster spool at lower RPMs. However, due to displacement-based taxation and cost of emissions testing in Europe, the CA18DET was sold as the only available engine in the S13 chassis 200SX (Euro model) until replaced by the S14 in 1994. The Euro motors received the 4 port (high port) head and intake manifold, as well as revised ECCS (\\"Electronic Concentrated Control System\\") parameters. CA20E The SOHC CA20E produces and .

However the blocks are similar, and it is possible to fit the DOHC CA18DE/T twincam head to the SOHC CA20 block. However the DOHC/SOHC manifolds are different and the timing pulley/belts are not compatible. Despite this, CA20DET turbos have been built. Tomei and JUN of Japan produced 2-litre stroker kits for the CA18. Also companies Norris Designs and Spool Imports produces CA20 stroker kits as well as a CA20 engine.

In 1957-1958, he delivered the Charles Eliot Norton lectures at Harvard University, which were published in 1961 under the title Language and Poetry: Some Poets of Spain. The final lecture was a tribute to his colleagues in the Generation of '27. In 1983, he was named Hijo Predilecto de Andaluc√≠a. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature four times. Biography Jorge Guill√©n was born in Valladolid where he spent his childhood and adolescence. From 1909 to 1911 he lived in Switzerland. He studied at the universities of Madrid ‚Äì lodging in the Residencia de Estudiantes ‚Äì and Granada, where he took his licenciatura in philosophy in 1913.Connell p 168 His life paralleled that of his friend Pedro Salinas, whom he succeeded as a Spanish lector at the Coll√®ge de Sorbonne in the University of Paris from 1917 to 1923. While in Paris, he met and, in 1921, married Germaine Cahen. They had two children, a son Claudio born in 1924 who became a noted critic and scholar of comparative literature, and a daughter Teresa who married the Harvard professor Stephen Gilman. He took his doctorate at the University of Madrid in 1924 with a dissertation on G√≥ngora's notoriously difficult and, at that time, neglected long poem Polifemo.Havard p 18 This was also the period when his first poems were starting to be published in Espa√±a and La pluma.Connell p 168 He was appointed to the chair of Spanish Literature at the University of Murcia from 1925 to 1929, where, with Juan Guerrero Ruiz and Jos√© Ballester Nicol√°s, he founded and edited a literary magazine called Verso y Prosa. He continued to visit the Residencia de Estudiantes although his academic responsibilities limited his attendance to vacations. This allowed him to make the acquaintance of the younger members of the Generation ‚Äì such as Rafael Alberti and Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. He became a regular correspondent of the latter and, on the occasion of a visit by Lorca to the Arts Club of Valladolid in April 1926, Guill√©n delivered an introduction to a poetry reading which was a considered and sympathetic appraisal of a man whom he considered to be already a poetic genius, although he had only published one collection.Gibson p 162 He also participated in the Tercentenary celebrations in honour of G√≥ngora. The volume of Octavas that he was supposed to edit, however, was never completed but he did give a reading of some of his own poems at an event in Seville with great success.Alberti p 254 He became the lector at Oxford University from 1929 to 1931, and was appointed to a professorship at the University of Seville in 1932. On 8 March 1933, he was present at the premiere in Madrid of Garc√≠a Lorca's play Bodas de sangre.Gibson p348 In August 1933, he was able to attend performances at the Magdalena Palace in Santander by the travelling theatre company La Barraca that Lorca led.Gibson p359 On 12 July 1936 he was present at a party in Madrid that took place just before Garc√≠a Lorca departed to Granada for the last time before his murder. It was there that Lorca read his new play La Casa de Bernarda Alba for the last time.Gibson p442 On the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936 he was back in Valladolid and was briefly imprisoned in Pamplona for political reasons.Havard p 67 He returned to his post in Seville and continued there until July 1938, when he decided to go into exile in the USA together with his wife and two teenage children. Apart from the turmoil in Spain itself, the fact that his wife was Jewish might have caused him concern.Havard p 67 He joined Salinas at Wellesley College and stayed there as the Professor of Spanish from 1941 to his retirement in 1957.Jorge Guillen Is Dead at 91; A Spanish Poet and Teacher - New York Times He retired to Italy. In 1958 in Florence he married Irene Mochi-Sismondi, his first wife having died in 1947. He continued to give lectures at Harvard, Princeton and Puerto Rico, and for a spell was Mellon Professor of Spanish at the University of Pittsburgh, until he broke his hip in a fall in 1970. In 1976 he moved to the city of M√°laga. In 1976, he was awarded the Premio Cervantes, the most prestigious prize for Spanish-language writers, and in 1977 the Premio Internacional Alfonso Reyes. He died in M√°laga in 1984, aged 91 and was buried there in the Anglican Cemetery of Saint George. Analysis of his work =C√°ntico= 1928 edition Although a glimpse at the collected poems of Guill√©n suggests that he was a prolific poet, he was slow to get started. He only seems to have started writing poems when he was in Paris in 1919 when he was already 25. Over the next 10 years he published quite frequently in the small magazines of the day and began to build a name for himself amongst the members of his generation, including D√°maso Alonso and Federico Garc√≠a Lorca.Havard p 11 As early as 1923 Pedro Salinas urged him to publish a collection but he would not be hurried. Two of his key character traits are revealed by this long gestation period: his quest for perfection and an innate reserve. He was in fact the last of the major figures of the generation to gather together a collection, the first instalment of C√°ntico- at this stage a collection of 75 poems ‚Äì which was published by the Revista de Occidente (a journal edited by Ortega y Gasset) in 1928. He was by this time 35. Correspondence with Garc√≠a Lorca shows just how painstaking he was, spending months polishing, revising and correcting poems that he had already written and published, to a point where they were practically unrecognisable from the way they had first appeared in public.Havard p 11 Clarity and coherence were his major objectives but he also seemed to wish to avoid obvious self- revelation and any hint of sentimentality. Lorca's reaction in a postcard to Guill√©n written on 27 December 1928 captures the elements that dominate most critical responses to the latter's poetry: an opposition between the jubilant, physical celebration of reality that his poems try to capture and, on the other hand, its extreme technical purity, which can seem cold and overly intellectual.Havard p 9 During his time in Paris, Guill√©n had come under the influence of Paul Val√©ry. Val√©ry was closely associated with the ideal of pure poetry and Guill√©n later recalled him saying that \\"Pure poetry is what is left after the elimination of everything that is not poetry.\\"Havard p 18 He was also inspired by Val√©ry's belief that a poet should only write one book ‚Äì Un, qui est le bon et le seul de son √™treVal√©ry Oeuvres vol 1 pp 1560-61 \\\\- a remark that makes sense of Guill√©n's career, both of the accretive process that led ultimately to the finished C√°ntico, and also of the impulse that led him to combine all his published poetry into one collection Aire nuestro in 1968. He also translated four of Val√©ry's poems, including the celebrated \\"Le Cimeti√®re marin,\\" into Spanish. However, in Language and Poetry, he also recorded a debt to the poetic rigour of G√≥ngora, showing that he could trace this concern for stylistic purity back much further than Val√©ry. Even in his earliest poems, such as \\"Gran silencio\\", the language is impersonal; the poet does not make any appearance in the poem. His poems offer an ecstatic reaction to the geometrical forms or the objects they describe but this is a generic reaction not Guill√©n's personal response. He is like an aesthetician or philosopher presenting things for the reader's edification. In \\"La salida\\", the only verbs that occur are infinitives. This means that what is described has no specific agent or time, again helping Guill√©n to become anonymous and guard against sentimentality.Havard p 14 Like Val√©ry, he also writes poems that reflect upon poetry itself, for example \\"El ruise√±or\\" and \\"La rosa\\", both written in Guill√©n's favourite form, the d√©cima, typically a stanza of 10 octosyllabic lines rhyming ABBAACCDDC, although he used many variations, such as a rhyme scheme borrowed from the French dizain, ABABCCDEED. However, although Val√©ry, > read and reread with great devotion by the Castilian poet, was a model of > exemplary elevation of subject matter and of exemplary rigor of > style,Guillen L and P p 208 Guill√©n concludes by saying that C√°ntico > can be defined negatively as the antithesis of Val√©ry's Charmes.Guillen L > and P p 208 Guill√©n stresses a determination to treat poetry as creation, a poem as a world in quintessence.Guillen L and P p 208 For Val√©ry, poetry is a process of self-discovery, an exercise in consciousness, working out what it means to be an individual poet exploring reality. Guill√©n accepts reality for what it is and he wants to show what he has in common with other humans in the timeless experience of being.Havard p 25 It is a phenomenology that derives from Ortega y Gasset as exemplified in his work Meditaciones del Quijote. 1936 edition The next edition of C√°ntico contained 125 poems. It was published by Cruz y Raya ‚Äì a journal edited by Jos√© Bergam√≠n ‚Äì in 1936. While many members of his generation had suffered some form of crisis towards the end of the 1920s ‚Äì amongst them Alberti, Garcia Lorca, Aleixandre, Cernuda ‚Äì there were no signs of personal upheaval or radical change in Guill√©n's approach to poetry. Instead there is a deepening of the approach to reality contained in the first edition. Reality is potentially perfect. All it requires is the active participation of an onlooker to raise it to its full potencyHavard p 39 as explained by Ortega in the Meditaciones. There is stylistic development as well in that some of the new poems are lengthy; \\"Salvaci√≥n de la primavera\\" amounts to 55 quatrains (220 lines) and \\"M√°s all√°\\", which eventually became the very first book in the collection, consists of 50 quatrains. There are also more medium-length poems of around 40-50 lines, such as \\"Viento saltado\\" and \\"El desterrado\\", most of which were written or started during Guill√©n's period of residence at Oxford. The collection is grouped into 5 sections, frequently book-ended by these longer poems, so that it has a more formally pleasing shape. The versification is also more varied; there are many more romances (octosyllabic lines with assonance in the even-numbered lines); Guill√©n starts to write sonnets; he introduces longer lines and also the assonantal quatrains of the longer poems. The longer poems are inevitably less abstract and impersonal but they do not show any real break with his approach to poetry. In place of the concentrated focus on one object or small group of objects, the longer poems have scope for a more comprehensive assessment of exterior reality. Instead of flashes of ecstasy, the pursuit of plenitude and essence is an ongoing quest. The poetry continues to avoid anecdotal narrative but the greater circumstantial and temporal definition of the longer poems gives this edition an enhanced awareness of human contact with the real world.Havard p 41 There is in addition a far more detailed examination of big themes such as love ‚Äì \\"Salvaci√≥n de la primavera\\" ‚Äì and death ‚Äì \\"Muerte a lo lejos\\" ‚Äì although the poet takes a very detached view of death. It will happen one day and until then, he can enjoy life in the present. Some of the new poems have epigraphs from Walt Whitman, such as \\"El desterrado\\". He might have come across Whitman during his time in France but his interest seems to have been consolidated during his Oxford period.Havard p 42 There are overlaps between Whitman's poetry and the thinking of Ortega as enshrined in his famous formula Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia from the Meditaciones, in other words I am the sum of my individual self and the things that surround me/that I perceive. This is perhaps explained most fully in \\"Viento saltado\\", which he began in Oxford in 1931.Havard p 51 It is a clear example of one of Guill√©n's stylistic characteristics, the use of exclamations. Everything in the poem is an exclamation as he displays an almost childlike delight at being buffeted by a blustery wind. 1945 edition A lot happened in Guill√©n's life before he published the next edition of C√°ntico in Mexico in 1945. By now the book had more than doubled in size, to 270 poems. A reader would expect events such as the mysterious death of his friend Garc√≠a Lorca, the Spanish Civil War, exile to the USA and the Second World War to have an effect on Guill√©n's poetry. Exile in particular seems to have hit him hard because he did not speak very good English and he remained very attached to his Spanish background.Havard p 68 But biographical references in his poems remain elusive. There is in this edition an increase in the number of poems that deal with pain and death. He also oscillates between extremes in a new and different way; some poems are stridently affirmative of his values while others are far more meditative and tranquil than hitherto. There are poems that deal with simple domestic pleasures, such as the home, family life, friendship and parenthood, which do not have any counterpart in the earlier editions. There are stylistic innovations. In Language and Poetry, one of the lectures is about the prosaic language of the mediaeval poet Gonzalo de Berceo, whom Guill√©n admired for his humility and faith. In the poem \\"Equilibrio\\", there is a plainness of syntax, compared with earlier poems, that seems to suggest that he is trying to emulate this. There are poems which suggest that Guill√©n feels that he is now living in an alien environment, such as \\"Vida urbana\\".Havard p 84 There is also the emergence of the theme of pain and suffering. Sometimes pain prevents the realization of plenitude, as in \\"Muchas gracias, adi√≥s\\"; sometimes awareness of pain and death can help to remind the poet of the importance of fighting for life. Although there are very few autobiographical references in C√°ntico, in this edition it is tempting to see references to the protracted illness and frequent hospital visits of his wife before her death in 1947, as well as the poet's own bouts of ill health. In \\"Su persona\\", he argues that loneliness is not to be defeated by turning to memories of shared joys, because they are merely phantasms. Instead, you have to face reality and find the good that exists there. In this edition, Guill√©n acknowledges that reality has a dark side but affirms that it can be resisted and must be resisted.Havard p 90 1950 the final edition The completed version contained 334 poems and was published in Buenos Aires. Amongst the new poems are ten very long ones that exemplify Guill√©n's search for clarity and cohesion. \\"A vista de hombre\\", for example, was begun in a New York hotel and deals with a view of an unnamed metropolis from a skyscraper. It develops the poet's thoughts on his relationship with the mass of people living and working in this city until it closes with the poet retiring to his bed. Unlike Garc√≠a Lorca in Poeta en Nueva York or countless other poets, the city is not inhuman, cold, abstract. The emphasis is on the mass of humanity it holds.Havard p 93 The city is a mix of good and evil, man's heroic endeavours and barbarity ‚Äì a reality that has to be embraced in totality even when you cannot understand it. The poet is both an isolated individual in a hotel room and a member of this society. Others of the new poems also echo this theme, showing that Guill√©n does not want to reject modern urban life but instead to find a way of incorporating it into his affirmative scheme. Although various poems evoke Murcia, Oxford and Manhattan, \\"Luz natal\\" contains the only place name in the whole of C√°ntico, el cerro de San Crist√≥bal, a hill outside Valladolid which he visited in 1949 to see his sick father. It is a meditation on the significance of this place, from which he began his journey towards reality and from which he still takes his bearings. It adds a new dimension to Guill√©n's poetry ‚Äì history. The protagonist is also a product of history and he has to come to terms with the good and the bad sides of his culture's history, just as he has to accept the good and bad of the reality that faces him.Havard p 106 In this final edition, Guill√©n completes his task of showing that human life is charged with structure and meaning which we need to explore in all its fullness.Havard p 118 A passage from Language and Poetry seems to sum up his poetics in this collection: :Reality is depicted in the poem, but not described in its external likeness. Reality, not realism. And feeling, without which there is no poetry, has no need of gesticulation. ‚Ä¶..This restraint in the displaying of emotions retains their vehemence, and indeed doubles their intensity. But for ears that hear not, harmonies such as these are almost confused with silence. That is why some of these poets were tried and found wanting for their coldness, even though they were dedicated to declaring their enthusiasm for the world, their fervour for life, their love for love.Guillen L and P p 205 : =Clamor= It was seven years before Guill√©n published another collection of poems, Marem√°gnum in 1957. This was the start of his second portmanteau collection, Clamor. The other two constituent parts were Que van a dar en la mar (a quotation from Jorge Manrique's Coplas por la muerte de su padre) in 1960 and A la altura de las circunstancias in 1963. It is not clear when he started work on these collections. The long gap between the final edition of C√°ntico and the first volume of Clamor suggest that the bulk of the work was done in the 1950s especially in view of the number of poems that were added to the two later editions of C√°ntico. This collection is almost the antithesis of C√°ntico. The continued optimism and delight in life that the poet had shown despite the upheavals in his personal life and the turmoil of world events must have begun to seem an inadequate response. So there are poems such as \\"Los intranquilos\\" which use much simpler, less distanced language and convey a sense of unease, dissatisfaction, uncertainty. In this poem, the only escape from all this is into the oblivion offered by drink or the television.Connell p 171 In C√°ntico, there were many poems about awakening and how wonderful it is to return into consciousness. In Clamor, dawn brings a desire to sink back into sleep and find oblivion. \\"Del trascurso\\" compares with \\"Muerte a lo lejos\\" from C√°ntico and not just because both poems are sonnets. In the earlier poem, death was somewhere in the future and life was to be enjoyed. In the later poem, the poet looks back to his past where the good memories are. He then clings to the present but cannot avoid the sense of a future that is shrinking every day. In \\"Viviendo\\", the poet is in the city, walking in the twilight surrounded by the hum of traffic. The poet feels part of a machine that is slowly ticking away time. He reaches the realization that the individual can die without the machine either slowing or stopping, regardless of whether the individual has completed his part of the work of that machine. As time goes by, the sight of tables on a caf√© terrace remind him that there is after all a human component to this machine. The conclusion that emerges is again resignation to the inevitability of death but there is no sense of consolation, merely an unconvincing stoicism of a man journeying from nothingness to nothingness.Connell p 172 It is a very different feel to \\"A vista de hombre\\". In \\"Modo paterno\\", lacking any definite faith in God or an afterlife, the poet tells himself that something of his will be saved and projected into the future by his children. This belief acts as a counterbalance to the sadness and pessimism of most of the collection. =Homenaje= It seems that this collection, although published in 1967, gathers together poems written between 1949‚Äì66, so it overlaps with the final stages of the writing of C√°ntico as well as with Clamor. It contains much occasional poetry, recording Guill√©n's readings, his friends, places visited, favourite painters etc. It also contains translations of French, Italian, German, English and Portuguese poetry. However, there are also more personal reflections. \\"Al m√°rgen de un C√°ntico\\", for example, shows his response to critics who had accused him of writing in abstractions ‚Äì such as Juan Ram√≥n Jim√©nez among others. \\"Historia inconclusa\\" recalls some of the writers who have meant most to him, including a subtle tribute to Garc√≠a Lorca. And there are also poems which show a new-found resignation or acceptance of life, free from the ambiguities and uncertainties of \\"Viviendo\\".Connell p 172 Guill√©n gave the title Aire nuestro to the compilation of his three great poetry books prior to 1968. He would later publish Y otros poemas (1973) and Final (1982). Guill√©n and Salinas These two poets have often been compared to each other.Morris To some extent this is because they were good friends and slightly older than most of the other leading members of their generation, as well as sharing similar career-paths, but they also seemed to share a similar approach to poetry. Their poems often have a rarefied quality and tend not to deal with \\"particulars\\", readily identifiable people and places. However, they did differ in many respects as exemplified by the titles they gave to their published lectures on Spanish poetry. At Johns Hopkins, Salinas published a collection called Reality and the Poet in Spanish Poetry, whereas Guill√©n's Norton lectures were called Language and Poetry. Both devoted single lectures to G√≥ngora and San Juan de la Cruz and the comparisons between them are instructive. Salinas seems to want to show us the poetic reality behind or beyond appearances, to educate us into how to see whereas Guill√©n gives us an account of the thoughts and sense-impressions going through his own mind: the reader is a viewer of this process not a participant in it.Connell p 168 Vicente Aleixandre recalled visiting Salinas and finding him at his desk with his daughter on one knee and his son on the other and stretching out a hand clutching a pen to shake hands with his visitor. Although he was also devoted to his family, Guill√©n probably worked in a secluded study.

The majority of the film's music is supplied by Talking Heads. A soundtrack album, titled Sounds from True Stories, featured songs by Byrne, Talking Heads, Terry Allen & The Panhandle Mystery Band, and others. Around the same time, Talking Heads released an album titled True Stories, composed of studio recordings of songs featured in the film. True Stories was released by Warner Bros. in the United States, Canada, Italy, and Sweden in 1986, with limited release elsewhere the following year. Byrne was given much creative control over the motion picture's direction, largely due to the mainstream success of Talking Heads' 1984 concert film Stop Making Sense. Plot The film is presented as a series of vignettes centered around Byrne as an unnamed, cowboy-hat-wearing stranger who visits the fictional Texas town of Virgil, where he observes the citizens as they prepare for the \\"Celebration of Specialness\\" to mark the 150th anniversary of Texas' independence. The event is being sponsored by the Varicorp Corporation, a local computer manufacturing plant. Among the many characters the visitor meets and interacts with, the most prominent are: * Louis Fyne, (John Goodman), a country-western-singing clean room technician at Varicorp who is unlucky in love, * Civic leader Earl Culver (Spalding Gray), who never speaks directly to his wife, Kay (Annie McEnroe), * Miss Rollings (Swoosie Kurtz), who never leaves her bed, * Mr. Tucker (Pops Staples), Miss Rollings' personal assistant, a kindly voodoo practitioner whom Louis hires to help him find love, * A conspiracy theorist preacher (John Ingle) whose shtick owes a great deal to the Church of the SubGenius, * Ramon (Tito Larriva), a Tejano singer who claims to hear tones from people, * \\"The Lying Woman\\" (Jo Harvey Allen), who recounts fantastic episodes from her life to anyone who will listen. Cast * David Byrne as The Narrator * John Goodman as Louis Fyne * Spalding Gray as Earl Culver * Annie McEnroe as Kay Culver * Swoosie Kurtz as Miss Rollings * Pops Staples as Mr. Tucker * John Ingle as The Preacher * Tito Larriva as Ramon * Jo Harvey Allen as The Lying Woman Production Stephen Tobolowsky recounts in an episode of his podcast The Tobolowsky Files that his girlfriend Beth Henley and he met David Byrne and Talking Heads when Jonathan Demme invited them to a preview screening of Stop Making Sense. Shortly afterward, Byrne invited Henley and Tobolowsky over to his house and showed them a collection of hundreds of drawings he had made and put up on his wall. He explained they were based on clippings he had scrapbooked from tabloids as the band had been on tour. He had been intrigued by the idea of making a film based on the premise, \\"What if all these stories were true?\\" and wanted Henley and Tobolowsky to write the script based on those drawings. Tobolowsky was aware that Texas was coming up on its sesquicentennial celebration, and thought that would provide a good framework for the characters Byrne had invented. Henley and he wrote a draft and provided it to Byrne, then did not hear back from him for about a year. It later turned out that Byrne had rewritten their script almost entirely, keeping only a few lines and the sesquicentennial framework from the first draft. However, he asked Tobolowsky and Henley for permission to list their names ahead of his as scriptwriters so the film would seem less like a \\"vanity project.\\" During Tobolowsky's early talks with Byrne, he related to Byrne the story of a series of psychic experiences he had during college, in which he had been able to hear \\"tones\\" that told him things about other people. Byrne incorporated this story into his rewrite, using it as the basis for Ramon's psychic powers and the song \\"Radio Head.\\" An early working title for the project (endorsed by bassist Tina Weymouth) was Wild Infancy. Locations for the filming took place in Dallas and its suburbs Allen, McKinney, Mesquite, Midlothian and Red Oak. The interior mall and fashion show scene was filmed in NorthPark Center in North Dallas, and the exterior mall was filmed at the now-demolished Big Town Mall in Mesquite. The parade scene at the end of the film includes various local groups, including the Tejas Low Riders Club and the Sunset High School Marching Band. Reception True Stories was not a commercial success at the time of its release. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 77%, based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 6.63/10. Roger Ebert gave it a glowing review with a rating of 3.5/4 stars. It has achieved success in home video release as a cult classic among fans of Byrne's work. Colin Greenland reviewed True Stories for White Dwarf #85, and stated that \\"True Stories is a tour of Virgil, Texas, Byrne's toytown utopia, whose peculiar citizens have neurosis down to a fine art. Zippy the Pinhead would be at home in Virgil.\\" =Home media= In 1987, the film was released on VHS and Laserdisc. On March 30, 1999, it was released onto DVD. On November 27, 2018, The Criterion Collection released a DVD and Blu-ray of the film. Music True Stories features a number of songs written by Byrne and performed by various members of the cast as well as by Talking Heads (the members of which make cameo appearances). Talking Heads released an album titled True Stories in which the band performs most of the songs from the film, including songs that were performed by the actors in the film. As such, the album is not generally considered a true soundtrack album, a fact Byrne points out in his liner notes on the release. Later, Byrne released an album containing primarily instrumental music from the soundtrack titled Sounds from True Stories, though it was never released on CD. While several of the cast performances were released as bonus tracks on 12-inch single releases, no full album of cast performances was released until 2018 (see below). Prior to 2018, few of the original versions of songs from the film found official release. The St. Thomas Aquinas School Choir's version of \\"Hey Now\\" was released on the 1987 Talking Heads UK CD single, \\"Radio Head\\"; the Pops Staples version of \\"Papa Legba\\" and Tito Larriva's version of \\"Radio Head\\" appear as extra tracks on the 2006 Rhino reissue of True Stories; and John Goodman's version of \\"People Like Us\\" was initially released as the B-side to the single for \\"Wild Wild Life\\" and later was released on the 2006 digital compilation Bonus Rarities and Outtakes, but the rest of the songs whose versions differ between the movie and album (John Ingle's \\"Puzzling Evidence\\" and Annie McEnroe's \\"Dream Operator\\") were not officially available. \\"Cocktail Desperado\\", recorded by Terry Allen and the Panhandle Mystery Band and featured in the film, is included on the Sounds from True Stories LP. The music video version of \\"Wild Wild Life\\" that debuted on MTV is largely a scene taken from the film, in which many of the film's characters (including John Goodman) lip-synch to the music in a night club; the video version is more risque and features more pop music references/parodies than seen in the film; the Prince and Billy Idol parodies remain in the film version. Similarly, the video for \\"Love for Sale\\" is the same as that seen in the film (in which Kurtz's character is shown watching it on TV) except the video version has additional footage of Talking Heads, more references to recognizable TV commercials of the day, and no intercuts to any of the film characters. In November 2018, True Stories, A Film by David Byrne: The Complete Soundtrack, a comprehensive soundtrack album with 23 songs as they were recorded for the film, was released. This marked the first time that the complete True Stories soundtrack was made publicly available, 32 years after the movie's original release. The soundtrack was issued to coincide with Criterion's 2018 DVD and Blu-ray release of the film, the latter of which it was also packaged with. The new-edition soundtrack includes the three Talking Heads performances with David Byrne on lead vocals that are featured in the movie, \\"Wild Wild Life,\\" \\"Love for Sale,\\" and \\"City of Dreams\\", which are the same recordings included on the Talking Heads album True Stories; otherwise, the material does not overlap with the Talking Heads album. The new edition includes the first official commercial release of McEnroe's \\"Dream Operator\\" and Ingle's \\"Puzzlin' Evidence\\". Legacy In January 2017, Red Letter Media published a video where Jay Bauman and Josh \\"The Wizard\\" Davis gave a retrospective review of the film. They focused on the eccentricity of the characters, the performance of David Byrne as the film's narrator, the way the film extensively incorporates music, and the observations the film makes about American culture. Both hosts praised it, and Davis said of the film, \\"It never gets old for me, and I've shown it to so many people\\".

The fort sits on a chalk hill of the same name that lies between the adjacent Dorset Downs and Cranborne Chase. The hill fort at Hambledon Hill is just to the north. The name probably comes from Old English \\"hod\\", meaning a shelter, though \\"hod\\" could also mean \\"hood\\", referring to the shape of the hill. The fort is roughly rectangular (), with an enclosed area of . There is a steep natural slope down to the River Stour to the west, the other sides have an artificial rampart, ditch and counterscarp (outer bank), with an additional rampart on the north side. The main entrance is at the south-east corner, with other openings at the south- west and north-east corners. A view of the northern side of Hod Hill with the inner rampart on the left, the ditch in the middle and the outer rampart on the right. The hillfort was inhabited by the Durotriges in the late Iron Age; whether this is the same tribe who fortified the hilltop in the middle Iron Age (radiocarbon analysis suggests a date of 500 BC for the main rampart) is unknown. There is extensive evidence of settlement within the fort, including platforms for roundhouses. Hod Hill is the second in a series of Iron Age earthworks,‚ÄòHill Forts of the Stour Valley‚Äô by David E. C. Jardine, 1985, Bournemouth Local Studies Publications starting from Hambledon Hill, and including Hod Hill, Spetisbury Rings, Buzbury Rings, Badbury Rings and Dudsbury Camp. The Iron Age port at Hengistbury Head forms a final Iron Age monument in this small chain of sites. The hill was captured in AD 43 by the Roman Second Legion (Augusta), led by Vespasian, who had already captured Maiden Castle and other hill forts to the south. Eleven iron ballista bolts have been found on the hill, clustered in the so-called \\"Chieftain's hut\\" area (two hut circles, one of which had an enclosure around it)Miles 1978: 69 but there are no other signs of a struggle, suggesting the Durotriges surrendered to the superior Roman army. The Romans built a camp () in the north-west corner of the original fort, occupied by a mixed force of 720 legionaries and auxiliaries. The fort was used as a base for about 5 or 6 years, but passed out of use by about AD 50, when troops were withdrawn for the campaigns against Caractacus in Wales, and the remaining men were moved to a new fort further west at Waddon Hill. The site was excavated in the 1950s by Sir Ian RichmondMiles 1978: 67 and his final report was published in 1969. Today the hill is an important calcareous grassland habitat, home to spectacular wild flowers and butterflies.

It was equivalent to Generaladmiral in the Kriegsmarine until 1945, or to Flottenadmiral in the Volksmarine until 1990. The rank was the highest ordinary military rank and the highest military rank awarded in peacetime; the higher rank of general field marshal was only awarded in wartime by the head of state. In general, a Generaloberst had the same privileges as a general field marshal. A literal translation of Generaloberst would be \\"uppermost general\\", but it is often translated as \\"colonel-general\\" by analogy to Oberst, \\"colonel\\", including in countries where the rank was adopted, e.g. in Russia (–≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª-–ø–æ–ª–∫–æ–≤–Ω–∏–∫, general- polkovnik). \\"Oberst\\" derives from the superlative form of Germanic ober (upper), cognate to English over, thus \\"Superior General\\" might be a more idiomatic rendering. The rank was created in 1854, originally for Emperor William I‚Äîthen Prince of Prussia‚Äîbecause traditionally members of the royal family were not promoted to the rank of field marshal. During the 19th century the rank was largely honorary and usually only held by members of the princely families or the Governor of Berlin. Regular promotion of professional officers to the grade did not begin until 1911. Since the rank of Generalfeldmarschall was also reserved for wartime promotions, the additional rank of a \\"supreme general in the capacity of a field marshal\\"‚Äîthe Generaloberst im Range eines Generalfeldmarschalls‚Äîwas created for promotions during peacetime. Such generals were entitled to wear four pips on their shoulder boards, compared to the normal three. As such, Generaloberst could be a peacetime equivalent of the general field marshal rank. Generaloberst was the second highest general officer rank‚Äîbelow field marshal‚Äîin the Prussian Army as well as in the German Empire (1871‚Äì1918), the Weimar Republic (1921‚Äì33), the Wehrmacht (which included the Luftwaffe, established in 1935) of Nazi Germany (1933‚Äì45), and the East German Nationale Volksarmee (1949‚Äì1991). As military ranks were often used for other uniformed services, the rank was also used by the Waffen-SS and the Ordnungspolizei of Nazi Germany, and the Volkspolizei and Stasi of East Germany. In East Germany, the rank was junior to the general of the army (Armeegeneral), as well as to the briefly extant, and never awarded, rank of Marschall der DDR.  Austro-Hungarian Army gorget patch Generaloberst of the k.u.k. Common Army In 1915 the Generaloberst ‚Äì Vez√©rezredes rank was introduced to the Austro-Hungarian Common Army.

It is one of the five voluntary societies of the German Red Cross. The Wasserwacht is a non-profit organization made up of on volunteers.  Tasks  The main task of the Wasserwacht is the prevention of drowning. The Wasserwacht's activities encompass many areas, including: = Swimming (Schwimmen) = A task of the Wasserwacht is the training of nonswimmers and the continuation of swimming education among the population. Badges are awarded based on the level of education, and begin with the \\"Seepferdchen\\" (early certificate) up to the Gold German Swimming Badge. = Rescue Swimming (Rettungsschwimmen) = ATV used by Wasserwacht Lifeguards This group is responsible for the education and training of lifeguards, swiftwater rescuers and rescue swimmers. It cooperates with German civil protection and German fire services, especially concerning floods. * Teaching of swimming, rescue swimming (German rescue swimming badge) and first aid to the population, especially youth, in schools and federations * Organization of competitions in life saving = Boating (Motorboot) = Wasserwacht vessel on Lake Constance The Wasserwacht provides live-saving services on most lakes in as well as on the coast of Germany. Therefore, they require fast and powerful transportation in case of an emergency. The Wasserwacht oversees regattas and sailing meetings. = Rescue diving (Rettungstauchen) = Rescue divers are needed for the salvaging of goods, vehicles, garbage, and corpses. The education of a rescue diver usually takes one to two years. Each active rescue diver of the Wasserwacht is required to undergo a dive-medical investigation annually. = Environmental protection (Naturschutz) = A task of the Wasserwacht is helping to keep nature and waterways clean. In order to accomplish these tasks the Wasserwacht educates interested people with qualified technical abilities from the other departments of the German Red Cross.  History  The Bavarian city Regensburg is considered to be the birthplace of the lifeguard service of the German Red Cross. In 1883, during a flood, German Red Cross aids were used for the first time. In the following years, \\"Sanit√§t und Wasserwehrkolonnen\\" (medical and water rescue stations) developed along the coast and inland waters. After World War II, the Wasserwacht, as a government organization, was forbidden by the allied military administration. But the Bavarian Red Cross, Bavarian regional organization of the German Red Cross, received permission to resume its work. Other regional organizations followed the example of Bavaria and reinstated their lifeguard services.  Schnelleinsatzgruppen  For the execution of emergency services on water, the Wasserwacht maintains Schnelleinsatzgruppen (emergency response units). The groups are usually equipped with special lifeguard and emergency service machinery.

The value of an abelian integral depends not only on the integration limits, but also on the path along which the integral is taken; it is thus a multivalued function of z. Abelian integrals are natural generalizations of elliptic integrals, which arise when :F(x,w)=w^2-P(x), \\\\, where P\\\\left(x\\\\right) is a polynomial of degree 3 or 4. Another special case of an abelian integral is a hyperelliptic integral, where P(x), in the formula above, is a polynomial of degree greater than 4\\\\.  History  The theory of abelian integrals originated with a paper by Abel. published in 1841. This paper was written during his stay in Paris in 1826 and presented to Augustin- Louis Cauchy in October of the same year. This theory, later fully developed by others,. was one of the crowning achievements of nineteenth century mathematics and has had a major impact on the development of modern mathematics. In more abstract and geometric language, it is contained in the concept of abelian variety, or more precisely in the way an algebraic curve can be mapped into abelian varieties. The Abelian Integral was later connected to the prominent mathematician David Hilbert's 16th Problem and continues to be considered one of the foremost challenges to contemporary mathematical analysis.  Modern view  In the theory of Riemann surfaces, an abelian integral is a function related to the indefinite integral of a differential of the first kind. Suppose we are given a Riemann surface S and on it a differential 1-form \\\\omega that is everywhere holomorphic on S, and fix a point P_0 on S, from which to integrate. We can regard :\\\\int_{P_0}^P \\\\omega as a multi-valued function f\\\\left(P\\\\right), or (better) an honest function of the chosen path C drawn on S from P_0 to P. Since S will in general be multiply connected, one should specify C, but the value will in fact only depend on the homology class of C. In the case of S a compact Riemann surface of genus 1, i.e. an elliptic curve, such functions are the elliptic integrals. Logically speaking, therefore, an abelian integral should be a function such as f. Such functions were first introduced to study hyperelliptic integrals, i.e., for the case where S is a hyperelliptic curve. This is a natural step in the theory of integration to the case of integrals involving algebraic functions \\\\sqrt{A}, where A is a polynomial of degree >4. The first major insights of the theory were given by Abel; it was later formulated in terms of the Jacobian variety J\\\\left(S\\\\right). Choice of P_0 gives rise to a standard holomorphic function :S\\\\to J(S) of complex manifolds. It has the defining property that the holomorphic 1-forms on S\\\\to J(S), of which there are g independent ones if g is the genus of S, pull back to a basis for the differentials of the first kind on S.

He was the son of Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough, third Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Early life He was educated at Eton College. During the Second World War he served in the British Army in North Africa, Italy and Germany. He was on the personal staff of Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexander (later created Lord Alexander). He was an Aide-de-Camp to Field Marshal Lord Wavell, the Viceroy of India, early in 1947. In 1934, his father claimed in the House of Commons of Northern Ireland at Stormont that there had been a plot to kidnap the young John Brooke by Irish nationalists during Sir Basil Brooke's time as Commandant of the Ulster Special Constabulary. This report led Sir Basil (as he then was) to dismiss every Catholic worker in his employ, for which he was accused of sectarianism.Northern Ireland House of Commons Official Report, Vol 34 Col 1116‚Äì1117 Political career As Captain John Brooke, he was elected to Fermanagh County Council for the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in 1947, serving until 1973, and was Chairman of the council from 1961 to 1973. He was appointed High Sheriff of Fermanagh for 1955. He succeeded his father as the UUP Stormont MP for Lisnaskea in a by-election on 22 March 1968. He retained that seat until the abolition of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in 1973. Brookeborough (when he was still Captain Brooke) was a member of a dissident group of Ulster Unionist backbench MPs who campaigned for the removal of Terence O'Neill as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. When O'Neill finally resigned in April 1969 his successor, Major James Chichester-Clark, brought some of this dissident group into his government. Capt. Brooke was made Parliamentary Secretary at the Ministry of Commerce (1969‚Äì1970), and then Parliamentary Secretary at the Department of the Prime Minister (1970‚Äì1972). Under Brian Faulkner's premiership, he was Government Chief Whip (1971‚Äì1972) and also served in the Cabinet from 1971 as Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance. In the Northern Ireland Assembly (1973‚Äì74) he represented North Down. When the Unionist Party of Northern Ireland (UPNI) was founded by pro- Sunningdale Agreement members of the UUP, Brooke joined in 1974 and was again elected for North Down to the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention (1975‚Äì76). He also represented the views of the UPNI in the House of Lords from 1973. At 5:13pm on 28 March 1972, Capt. Brooke delivered the final speech from the dispatch box in the House of Commons of Northern Ireland at Stormont prior to the proroguing of the Parliament of Northern Ireland by Edward Heath's Conservative government. In it, he quoted from a poem by Rudyard Kipling entitled Ulster, written in 1914, about the time his father's involvement in Ulster loyalism might be said to have begun. It ended: > \\"Before an empire's eyes the traitor claims his price. > What need of further lies? We are the sacrifice.\\" Family Lord Brookeborough married Rosemary Chichester, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur O'Neill Cubitt Chichester, of Galgorm Castle, County Antrim, in 1949. They had five children: Alan, Christopher, Juliana, Melinda and Susanna. Rosemary, Lady Brookeborough, died in January 2007. She had lived at Ashbrooke House, the dower house on the family's Colebrooke Estate near Brookeborough in County Fermanagh, for many years.

The Triumph 1500 is a small front-wheel drive car that was produced by Standard-Triumph from 1970 to 1973. In 1973 it was revised as the Triumph 1500TC. Production ended in 1976, by which time it had been replaced by the Triumph Dolomite.  1500  Whilst retaining the front-wheel drive of the Triumph 1300, the body featured a restyled nose, a lengthened tail, twin headlights, horizontally mounted rear light clusters and a larger boot. The interior was also restyled featuring a new design of dashboard and door cards but retaining the wooden door cappings. The size of the Standard SC engine was increased to with a single SU carburettor and had a power output of . The suspension used coil springs all round and was independent at the front, incorporating a dead-beam rear axle at the back, which represented something of a technological retreat from the all-independent suspension offered by the 1300. In 1972 the power output was increased to with an uprated carburettor and inlet manifold. These later cars also had a silver nose badge. Earlier cars had a black nose badge. The car was capable of reaching a top speed of and could accelerate from 0‚Äì60 mph in 16.5 seconds.

It retained the same 1493 cc engine with twin SU carburettors but these were now mated to the rear wheel drive drivetrain from the recently introduced Triumph Dolomite. The interior and exterior styling remained largely the same. The 1500TC can be identified by the \\"1500TC\\" bootlid badge and the black centres on the wheel trims, which were blue on the 1500. The 1500TC was replaced by the Dolomite 1500/1500HL in March 1976. The car was capable of reaching a top speed of 92 mph (148 km/h) and could accelerate from 0‚Äì60 mph in 14.0 seconds (0‚Äì100 km/h in 14.8 seconds). A sunroof option was available.

The screenplay by Jane Murfin and Jules Furthman is based on the 1935 novel of the same title by Edna Ferber. For his performance, Walter Brennan as Swan Bostrom, became the first recipient of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Plot Ruthless lumberjack foreman Barney Glasgow (Edward Arnold) will stop at nothing to achieve his goal, to someday become the head of the logging industry in 19th century Wisconsin. His determination to succeed leads him to end his relationship with saloon singer Lotta Morgan (Frances Farmer) and marry Emma Louise Hewitt (Mary Nash), the daughter of his boss Jed Hewett (Charles Halton), in order to secure a partnership in his business. Over two decades later, a wealthy and successful Barney and Emma Louise's son Richard (Joel McCrea) strongly objects to his father's practice of destroying forests without planting new trees. Barney visits his old friend Swan Bostrom (Walter Brennan), who married Lotta when Barney rejected her. Swan is now a widower raising a daughter, also named Lotta (also played by Frances Farmer), who bears a striking resemblance to her mother. Barney finds himself attracted to the girl and, foolishly hoping to recapture the love he abandoned as a young man, offers to finance her education. Complications arise when Richard meets Lotta and takes a strong interest in her, which is reciprocated, much to Barney's displeasure and jealousy.

He also was intrigued by the fact Hawks' grandfather had served as the basis for the character of Barney Glasgow. Ferber had approved Jane Murfin's script, which Hawks found wanting, and he persuaded her and Goldwyn to allow him to bring in Jules Furthman to work on a rewrite.Berg, A. Scott, Goldwyn: A Biography. New York: Alfred A. Knopf 1989. , p. 275 Goldwyn announced Miriam Hopkins would play the dual roles of Lotta Morgan and Lotta Bostrom, but Hawks was not happy with his choice. He looked at numerous screen tests of aspiring starlets and finally settled on Andrea Leeds, who previously had played minor or uncredited roles in a handful of films. Eventually he replaced her with the even less experienced Frances Farmer and cast Leeds in the supporting role of Ewie Glasgow, Richard's younger sister, instead. Goldwyn tried to borrow Spencer Tracy from MGM for the lead role of Barney Glasgow, but Louis B. Mayer refused to let him work for his chief rival, so contract player Edward Arnold was assigned the role.Berg, pp. 275-276 Soon after filming began, Goldwyn underwent two major surgeries that incapacitated him for a lengthy period of time, keeping him away from the studio and the daily rushes. Hawks took advantage of the situation and allowed Furthman to change completely the tone of Ferber's original story; cast slender Walter Brennan as Swan Bostrom, a man Ferber had described as \\"the strongest man in the North woods;\\" and arrange a shooting schedule and budget Goldwyn never would have approved.Berg, pp. 279-280 Upon returning to the studio, Goldwyn viewed a rough cut of the film and was shocked to discover Hawks had shifted the focus from the unbridled destruction of the land to a love triangle in which brawling Barney Glasgow and Swan Bostrom vied for the affections of lusty Lotta Morgan. The character of Richard Glasgow, intended to be the second lead, barely was in the film, which was cluttered with Hawks-like improvised bits of business. When the director refused to comply with Goldwyn's demands for major changes, the producer fired Hawks from the project.Berg, p. 282 William Wyler had begun post-production work on Dodsworth when he was summoned to Goldwyn's home and told he would be completing Come and Get It. Wyler was loath to take over a film started by someone else, but Goldwyn threatened him with suspension if he refused to accept the assignment. He did so reluctantly, and in later years he recalled, \\"I was talked into doing it, and I've been sorry about that ever since. The picture wasn't very good.\\" Wyler spent two weeks filming what amounted to about the final third of the completed film. He strongly objected to Goldwyn's desire to give him sole directing credit, and preferred his name not be attached to the film at all. He finally relented but only when Goldwyn agreed to give Hawks top billing. Wyler never considered Come and Get It a part of his filmography and disowned it whenever he could, although it greatly pleased Ferber, who praised Goldwyn \\"for the courage, sagacity, and power of decision\\" he demonstrated by \\"throwing out the finished Hawks picture and undertaking the gigantic task of making what amounted to a new picture.\\"Berg, pp. 283-284Herman, Jan, A Talent for Trouble: The Life of Hollywood's Most Acclaimed Director. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons 1995. , pp. 161-163 Exterior scenes were filmed along the North Fork Clearwater River in Idaho. The soundtrack includes \\"Aura Lea\\" by George R. Poulton and W. W. Fosdick and \\"The Bird on Nellie's Hat\\" by Alfred Solman and Arthur J. Lamb. Edward Arnold reprised the role of Barney Glasgow in two radio adaptations of the Ferber novel. The first aired on Lux Radio Theater on November 13, 1937, and the second was broadcast by The Screen Guild Theater on March 15, 1942. Critical reception Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times felt compressing Ferber's saga spanning fifty years into the story of a single generation \\"arrested the panoramic sweep of the story, converting it from a mural of the American scene into a vividly toned portrait of a man. But the transformation is readily excusable, for Barney was the heart of the novel and we felt it had stopped beating when he died.\\" He added, \\"Although there is nothing new in the theme, it has been simply and powerfully expressed by a number of admirable performances, and it has been played against an interesting background. There are several extraordinarily graphic scenes of logging operations, the atmosphere of the late Eighties and early Nineties has been reproduced handsomely in the settings and costumes and . . . it never fails to reward your attention. There's nothing static about this one, thanks to Howard Hawks and William Wyler, the directors; to Gregg Toland's photography, and to the work of a uniformly fine cast.\\" He concluded, \\"You won't find Come and Get It a thoroughly Ferber work, but enough of her has been retained and enough good Goldwyn added to make it a genuinely satisfying picture.\\"The New York Times review British Channel 4 observed, \\"It's a minor Hawks, to be sure, and the action does tend to lag at times, but the fine performances from Farmer, Brennan and McCrea are what make it.\\"Channel 4 review Awards and honors For his performance, Walter Brennan became the first recipient of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Edward Curtiss was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Film Editing but lost to Ralph Dawson for Anthony Adverse.

Beniamino Gigli considered Cebotari one of the greatest female voices he ever heard. Maria Callas was compared to her, and Angela Gheorghiu named Maria Cebotari among the artists she admires the most. Her funeral was \\"one of the most imposing demonstrations of love and honor any deceased artist has ever received\\" in the history of Vienna, with thousands of people attending. Biography Cebotari was born at Chi≈üinƒÉu, in Bessarabia, and studied singing at the Chi≈üinƒÉu Conservatory, and in 1929 joined the Moscow Art Theater Company as an actress. Soon she married the company's leader, Count Alexander Virubov. Moving to Berlin with the company, she studied singing with Oskar Daniel for three months and made her debut as an operatic singer by singing Mimi in Puccini's opera La Boh√®me at Dresden Semperoper on 15 March 1931. Bruno Walter invited her to the Salzburg Festival, where she sang Euridice in Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice. In 1935, she sang the part of Aminta in the world premiere of Richard Strauss' opera Die Schweigsame Frau under Karl B√∂hm at Dresden Semper Opera House. Strauss advised her to move to Berlin, and in 1936 she joined the Berlin State Opera, where she was a prima donna until 1946. That year, she sang Susanna in Le Nozze di Figaro, Zerlina in Don Giovanni, and Sophie in Der Rosenkavalier for Dresden Semper Opera Company's performances at Covent Garden Royal Opera House of London. From then on, she appeared at many great opera houses including Vienna State Opera and La Scala Opera House of Milan. She divorced Count Virubov in 1938, and married the Austrian actor Gustav Diessl, with whom she had two sons. In 1946, she left Berlin and joined the Vienna State Opera House. She visited Covent Garden again in 1947 with Vienna State Opera Company and sang Salome, Donna Anna in Don Giovanni, Countess Almaviva in Le nozze di Figaro. On September 27, she was Donna Anna to the Ottavio of Richard Tauber, making his final stage appearance, less than a week before his cancerous left lung was removed. Her husband, the actor Gustav Diessl, died of a heart attack on March 20, 1948. She suffered from severe pain during the performance of Le nozze di Figaro at La Scala Opera House in early 1949. At first, doctors did not take it seriously. However, on March 31, 1949, she fell down during the performance of Karl Mill√∂cker's operetta Der Bettelstudent in Vienna. During surgery on April 4, doctors found cancer in her liver and pancreas. She died from cancer on June 9, 1949 in Vienna. British pianist Sir Clifford Curzon adopted her two sons. Cebotari had an extremely versatile voice, and her repertoire covered coloratura, soubrette, lyric and dramatic roles; for example, she sang both Countess Almaviva and Susanna in Le nozze di Figaro, Violetta in La traviata and Salome in the same season. She concentrated on four composers ‚Äì Mozart, Richard Strauss, Verdi, Puccini. Richard Strauss described her as \\"the best all-rounder on the European stage, and she is never late and she never cancels\\". Herbert von Karajan, during a BBC interview decades after her death, said she was the greatest \\"Madame Butterfly\\" he had ever conducted. Films Beside her successful career at the opera houses, Cebotari appeared in several films related to opera‚Äîsuch as \\"Verdi's Three Women\\", \\"Maria Malibran\\", \\"The Dream of Madame Butterfly\\". She also played in the movie \\"Odessa in fiamme (Odessa in flames)\\", in 1942, directed by Italian director Carmine Gallone (script by Nicolae Kiri≈£escu). The movie is a Romanian-Italian co-production, about the drama of the refugees from Bessarabia (Republic Moldova), in World War II and does homage to the Romanian troops who freed Bessarabia from the Red Army which occupied it in 1940. The movie includes contemporary newsreels showing refugee columns running away. It won the great prize at the Festival of Venice, in 1942. Maria Cebotari plays the role of Maria Teodorescu, opera singer from Bessarabia, who was in Chisinau with her 8-year-old son at the time of the invasion. The boy was taken somewhere in Odessa. The mother was told that he will be maintained in a camp, where he will be educated as a man again, as Soviet. The mother agrees to sing Russian songs in theaters and taverns but only to get her son back. Maria Teodorescu sings in those places, sharing pictures of hers. One such image is found by chance by her husband, who is in Romanian army with the rank of captain (he was in Bucharest at the time of the invasion). In the end the family reunites. Unfortunately, the history of the movie was a sad one. Because of the invasion by Soviet troops in Bucharest in 1944, the movie became banned, along with many others, and the actors in the movie arrested. Many such movies were either destroyed or censored and nothing was heard of it for more than 50 years. Luckily, someone re-discovered it in the Cinecitt√† archives in Rome, and it was shown for the first time in Romania in December 2006. Director Victor Druc's documentary \\"Aria\\" (2005) about the life of Maria Cebotari faced difficulties when screening in Moldova during the Communist administration (which ended in 2009), due to a part in the movie where the soprano self-identifies as Romanian, contrary to the official policy of the Communist government that calls the ethnic majority Moldovan, rather than Romanian Ziarul de Garda, no. 270, April 1, 2010. http://www.zdg.md/oameni/cantareata-zburatoare See also Controversy over linguistic and ethnic identity in Moldova. Recordings Many of her surviving recordings are from live performances ‚Äì either in the opera houses or in the studio for radio broadcast. Almost all of them have now been digitally remastered and their general quality is remarkable. Her complete recording of Salome (live performance on September 30, 1947, at Covent Garden) shows that she is one of the greatest Salomes captured in recordings, in spite of extremely poor sound quality.

FC Lokomotive Leipzig fans before their team's encounter with SG Dynamo Schwerin in the East German FDGB-Pokal in 1990 Football hooliganism or soccer hooliganism is disorderly, violent or destructive behaviour perpetrated by spectators at association football events. Football hooliganism normally involves conflict between gangs, in English known as football firms (derived from the British slang for a criminal gang), formed to intimidate and attack supporters of other teams. Other English-language terms commonly used in connection with hooligan firms include \\"army\\", \\"boys\\", \\"bods\\", \\"casuals\\", and \\"crew\\". Certain clubs have long-standing rivalries with other clubs and hooliganism associated with matches between them (sometimes called local derbies) is likely to be more severe. Conflict may take place before, during or after matches. Participants often select locations away from stadiums to avoid arrest by the police, but conflict can also erupt spontaneously inside the stadium or in the surrounding streets. In extreme cases, hooligans, police, and bystanders have been killed, and riot police have intervened. Hooligan-led violence has been called \\"aggro\\" (short for \\"aggression\\") and \\"bovver\\" (the Cockney pronunciation of \\"bother\\", i.e. trouble). Hooligans who have the time and money may follow national teams to away matches and engage in hooligan behaviour against the hooligans of the home team. They may also become involved in disorder involving the general public. While national-level firms do not exist in the form of club-level firms, hooligans supporting the national team may use a collective name indicating their allegiance. Behaviour Football hooliganism involves a wide range of behaviour, including: * taunting * spitting * unarmed fighting * throwing of objects on to the pitch, either in an attempt to harm players and officials or as a gesture of insult. *throwing of objects at opposing supporters, including stones, bricks, coins, flares and Molotov cocktails. * fighting with weapons including sports bats, glass bottles, rocks, rebar, knives, machetes and firearms. * disorderly crowd behaviour such as pushing, which may cause stadium fixtures such as fences and walls to collapse. Similar effects can occur when law-abiding crowds try to flee disorder caused by hooligans. * In some places, there is vandalism in the form of graffiti sprayed to promote football teams, especially in derby cities. Early history The first instance of football violence is unknown, but the phenomenon can be traced back to 14th-century England. In 1314, Edward II banned football (at that time, a violent, unruly activity involving rival villages kicking a pig's bladder across the local heath) because he believed the disorder surrounding matches might lead to social unrest, or even treason. According to a University of Liverpool academic paper, conflict at an 1846 match in Derby, England, required a reading of the riot act and two groups of dragoons to effectively respond to the disorderly crowd. This same paper also identified \\"pitch invasions\\" as a common occurrence during the 1880s in English football. The first recorded instances of football hooliganism in the modern game allegedly occurred during the 1880s in England, a period when gangs of supporters would intimidate neighbourhoods, in addition to attacking referees, opposing supporters and players. In 1885, after Preston North End beat Aston Villa 5‚Äì0 in a friendly match, both teams were pelted with stones, attacked with sticks, punched, kicked and spat at. One Preston player was beaten so severely that he lost consciousness and press reports at the time described the fans as \\"howling roughs\\". The following year, Preston fans fought Queen's Park fans in a railway station‚Äîthe first alleged instance of football hooliganism outside of a match. In 1905, a number of Preston fans were tried for hooliganism, including a \\"drunk and disorderly\\" 70-year-old woman, following their match against Blackburn Rovers. Although instances of football crowd violence and disorder have been a feature of association football throughout its historyDunning, E, Murphy, P and Williams, J., 'The Roots of Football Hooliganism' 1988, Taylor & Francis (e.g. Millwall's ground was reportedly closed in 1920, 1934 and 1950 after crowd disturbances), the phenomenon only started to gain the media's attention in the late 1950s due to the re-emergence of violence in Latin American football. In the 1955‚Äì56 English football season, Liverpool and Everton fans were involved in a number of incidents and, by the 1960s, an average of 25 hooligan incidents were being reported each year in England. The label \\"football hooliganism\\" first began to appear in the English media in the mid-1960s,Stott, C. and Pearson, G., 'Football Hooliganism: Policing and the War on the English Disease', 2007 London: Pennant Books leading to increased media interest in, and reporting of, acts of disorder. It has been argued that this, in turn, created a 'moral panic' out of proportion with the scale of the actual problem.Hall, S, 'The Treatment of 'Football Hooligans' in the Press', in Ingham et al., (1978) Football Hooliganism: The Wider Context, London: Inter-Action Inprint Causes Football hooliganism has factors in common with juvenile delinquency and what has been called \\"ritualized male violence\\".Ram√≥n Spaaij, Understanding Football Hooliganism: A Comparison of Six Western European Countries Sports Studies scholars Paul Gow and Joel Rookwood at Liverpool Hope University found in a 2008 study that \\"Involvement in football violence can be explained in relation to a number of factors, relating to interaction, identity, legitimacy and power. Football violence is also thought to reflect expressions of strong emotional ties to a football team, which may help to reinforce a supporter's sense of identity.\\" In relation to the Heysel Stadium disaster one study from 1986 claimed that alcohol, irregular tickets sales, the disinterest of the organisers and the \\"'cowardly ineptitude'\\" of the police had led to the tragedy. Gow and Rookwood's 2008 study, which used interviews with British football hooligans found that while some identified structural social and physiological causes (e.g. aggression produces violent reactions) most interviewees claimed that media reports (especially in newspapers) and the police's handling of hooligan related events were the main causes of hooliganism. Political reasons may also play in part in hooliganism, especially if there is a political undertone to such a match (e.g. unfriendly nations facing each other). Other deep division undertones in a match such as religion, ethnic, and class play a part as well in hooliganism. As an attempt to explain the hooliganism phenomena in Brazil, Nepomuceno and other scholars at Federal University of Pernambuco have assessed 1363 hooligan incidents before and after an alcohol sanction enforced during 8 years. While alcohol presented low evidence of contribution to the incidents of violence, the knockout phases, finals, competitiveness (derby matches), small score boundaries and the pride levels were some of the potentials for the violence among sports spectators. Months after the work being conducted, the State Legislature of Pernambuco decided to abolish the sanction to allow alcohol intake in stadiums. Writing for the BBC in 2013, David Bond stated that in the UK, Subculture Football hooligans often appear to be less interested in the football match than in the associated violence. They often engage in behaviour that risks them being arrested before the match, denied admittance to the stadium, ejected from the stadium during the match or banned from attending future matches. Hooligan groups often associate themselves with, and congregate in, a specific section (called an end in England) of their team's stadium, and sometimes they include the section's name in the name of their group. In the United Kingdom, 1960s and early 1970s football hooliganism was associated with the skinhead subculture. Later, the casual subculture transformed the British football hooligan scene. Instead of wearing working- class skinhead-style clothes, which readily identified hooligans to the police, hooligans began wearing designer clothes and expensive \\"offhand\\" sportswear (clothing worn without careful attention to practical considerations), particularly Stone Island, Prada, Burberry, CP Company, Sergio Tacchini and Adidas. Fans of the FC Karpaty Lviv football club honouring the Nazi Waffen-SS Galizien division, in Lviv, Ukraine, 2013 Anti- hooligan measures Police and civil authorities in various countries with hooligan problems have taken a number of measures, including: * banning items that could be used as weapons or missiles in stadiums, and searching suspected hooligans * banning identified hooligans from stadiums, either formally via judicial orders, or informally by denying them admittance on the day * moving to all-seated stadiums, which reduces the risk of disorderly crowd movement * segregating opposing fans, and fencing enclosures to keep fans away from each other and off the pitch * banning opposing fans from matches and/or ordering specific matches to be played behind closed doors * compiling registers of known hooligans * restricting the ability of known hooligans to travel overseas. Europe Czech police prepare for trouble after a match by suiting up in riot gear. =Bosnia and Herzegovina= Football hooliganism in Bosnia and Herzegovina is particularly associated with the supporters of clubs such as FK Sarajevo (Horde Zla), FK ≈Ωeljezniƒçar Sarajevo (The Maniacs), FK Vele≈æ Mostar (Red Army), H≈†K Zrinjski Mostar (Ultrasi) and FK Borac Banja Luka (Le≈°inari). Other clubs with hooligans as supporters include FK Sloboda Tuzla (Fukare), NK ƒåelik Zenica (Robija≈°i) and NK ≈†iroki Brijeg (≈†kripari). Hooliganism reflects local ethnic divisions and tensions. Bosniak oriented groups are fans of FK Sarajevo, FK ≈Ωeljezniƒçar and FK Vele≈æ Mostar. Serb oriented groups are fans of FK Borac Banja Luka, FK Slavija, and FK Drina Zvornik (Vukovi). Croat oriented groups are fans of NK ≈†iroki Brijeg (≈†kripari) and H≈†K Zrinjski Mostar. Many fans are associated with fascist ideologies, supporting and glorifying extremist movements such as the Usta≈°e, Chetniks and Nazis. In 2009 riots between supports of Bosnian Premier League club sides NK ≈†iroki Brijeg and FK Sarajevo left Horde Zla supporter Vedran Puljiƒá (from Sarajevo) dead from a gunshot wound. Hooliganism has also been present in lower leagues. Riots have been common in Jablanica because fans of different clubs tend to meet and clash there. =Croatia= Football hooliganism in Croatia has seen riots over inter-ethnic resentments and the politics that were reignited by the breakup of the Yugoslav federation in the 1990s. Two of the best known hooligan firms are Torcida (Hajduk Split) and Bad Blue Boys (Dinamo Zagreb). However, the groups are not just hooligan firms; they are more like the South American Torcida supporters groups and Ultras groups, with organised Tifos and so on. On 13 May 1990 (before the breakup of Yugoslavia) Serbian club Red Star Belgrade was in Zagreb to play Dinamo Zagreb at the Maksimir Stadium. Red Star was accompanied by 3000 Delije, the organised supporters of the club. Before the match a number of small fights broke out. Police reinforcements soon arrived with armoured vehicles and water cannons, focusing to separate the fans. Dinamo's player Zvonimir Boban kicked one policeman, defending a Dinamo's fan beaten by the police. The fighting lasted for over an hour and hundreds of people were injured. Football hooliganism in Croatia is sometimes connected with racism and nationalism, although the racist remarks, if any appear, are aimed solely to the opposing club's players, never to one's own squad. Ethnic tension between Croats and Serbs has also led to fighting at a football match in Australia. On 13 March 2005, Sydney United (who have a large Croatian following, and were established by Croatian immigrants) and Bonnyrigg White Eagles (who have a large Serbian following and were established by Serbian immigrants) met in Sydney in the New South Wales Premier League. About 50 fans clashed, resulting in two police officers getting injured and five fans being arrested. Football NSW held an inquiry into the events. Both clubs denied that the fight was racially motivated or that there was any ethnic rivalry. Croatian hooligans are also notorious for staging large illegal pyroshows at stadiums, where signal flares and smoke bombs are hurled onto the pitch causing postponement or cancellation of the match. A large incident occurred in 2003 in Rome during the Hajduk-Roma match when 900 Torcida fans threw signal flares at Roma fans resulting in various injuries and clashes with the police. Another incident occurred in Genoa in 2007 when masked Torcida fans attacked the police with bricks, bottles and stones. Rioting continued in the stadium when Torcida fans threw chairs into the pitch and made Nazi salutes. A riot occurred in 2006 in Osijek during the Osijek-Dinamo match. Several clashes between the Bad Blue Boys and Kohorta occurred before the match in which one Osijek fan received several stab wounds after which Osijek fans attacked the police and Dinamo fans with signal flares and stones. A large riot occurred in 2008 in Prague prior to the Sparta Prague-Dinamo match. Riots were ignited with the support of Sparta's ultrafans to Radovan Karad≈æiƒá and Ratko Mladiƒá.Index.hr BBB se susreƒáu s ljubiteljima Karad≈æiƒáa i Mladiƒáa, 8 August 2008 Approximately 500 Bad Blue Boys rioted in the city centre breaking shops and attacking police with chairs, signal flares and stones. Approximately 300 Bad Blue Boys were detained and eight police officers were injured. Prior to the riots some Bad Blue Boys provoked local Romani people by giving Nazi salutes. A large riot occurred in 2010 on 1 May at the Maksimir stadium when the Bad Blue Boys clashed with the police resulting in many arrests and one critically injured police officer. After the match violent clashes continued in which one Dinamo fan was shot by police officers. A large incident occurred in 2009 prior to the FC Timi≈üoara-Dinamo match. 400 Bad Blue Boys rioted in the city centre and attacked local people. After the incident Romanian police detained a large number of Dinamo fans but the situation escalated again at the FC Timi≈üoara stadium when 200 Bad Blue Boys tore down the pitch fence and attacked the police with chairs and bats resulting in several injured police officers. During the clash, Dinamo fans fired signal missiles at FC Timi≈üoara fans resulting in severe injuries. Many Croatian hooligan groups have also displayed Nazi flags at matches and have neo-nazi skinheads in their ranks. Several incidents occurred when Bad Blue Boys and Torcida made racist chants towards opposing club's football players of African descent and hurled bananas in the pitch. In 2010, a Cameroon player was attacked in Koprivnica resulting in severe injuries. In December 2010, 10‚Äì15 Tornado (Zadar) hooligans attacked a Partizan traveling coach with stones and bricks resulting in one injured person. In December 2010 30‚Äì40 Bad Blue Boys attacked a PAOK traveling coach with stones, bricks and flares setting the traveling coach on fire and inflicting injuries on several passengers. In November 2014, during a Euro 2016 qualifying game in Milan, Italy, hooligans from Croatia threw flares and fireworks onto the field and the game had to be briefly suspended. =Cyprus= Football hooliganism in Cyprus has been an issue for the past few decades and incidents are generally associated with the 5 major Cypriot clubs. Anorthosis Famagusta FC fans have been in involved in many incidents on most occasions involving their ultras group \\"Mahites\\". The two clubs in Limassol, AEL Limassol and Apollon Limassol have also been involved in numerous incidents, especially in recent years. Supporters of APOEL FC and AC Omonia Nicosia, the two most successful and most popular clubs in the country are notorious for hooliganism. The most violent cases of hooliganism in Cyprus usually involve the two teams.http://www.ant1iwo.com/kypros/2012/05/17/skhniko-polemoy-sth-lemeso- videos/ In May 2009 APOEL fans entered the Omonia stand and engaged in fistfights with Omonia fans eventually throwing one down the stand stairs. 6 months later in November fans of the two teams clashed close to the GSP Stadium when APOEL fans tried to hijack a futsal tournament organized by Omonia. Many were injured including an APOEL fan who was almost beaten to death.http://www.agelioforos.gr/default.asp?pid=7&ct;=5&artid;=12118 The rivalry between Omonia and APOEL has its roots in politics. APOEL fans are in their majority right wing whereas Omonia fans are left wing. Communist symbols in the Omonia stand and right wing or even fascist symbols in the APOEL stand are not uncommon. The Limassol rivalry between Apollon and AEL Limassol is more a matter of what team dominates over the city. Hooliganism in the case of Anorthosis is also politically linked, especially when the club plays a left wing team such as Omonia. Other incidents between clubs of different cities that are of the same political orientation are associated with intercity rivalries, particularly when a club from Limassol faces a club from Nicosia. =France= This photo of a match in Lille shows the use of flares by PSV Eindhoven supporters in football hooliganism. Football hooliganism in France is often rooted in social conflict, including racial tension. In the 1990s, fans of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) fought with supporters from Belgium, England, Germany, Italy and Scotland. There is a long-standing north‚Äìsouth rivalry between PSG (representing Paris and by extension northern France) and Olympique de Marseille (representing the South of France) which has encouraged authorities to be extremely mobilised during games between the two teams. Violent fights and post-game riots including car burning, and shop windows smashing have been a regular fixture of PSG-OM games. In 2000, the bitter rivalry turned particularly violent when a Marseille fan was seriously injured by a projectile. On 24 May 2001, fifty people were injured when fighting broke out at a match between PSG and Turkish club Galatasaray at the Parc des Princes stadium.UEFA launched an immediate investigation with the possibility of serious penalties for the club. PSG were initially given a record $571,000 fine, but it was reduced on appeal to $114,000. Galatasaray was initially fined $114,000 by UEFA, but it too was eventually reduced to $28,500. In May 2001, six PSG fans from the Supporters Club, were arrested and charged with assault, carrying weapons, throwing items on the pitch and racism. The six were alleged to have deliberately entered a part of the Parc des Princes stadium where French fans of Turkish origin were standing, in order to attack them. The six were banned from all football stadiums for the duration of their trial.The Turkish press accused the security, media and PSG club of attempting to cover up the injuries. On 24 November 2006 a PSG fan was shot and killed by police and another seriously injured during fighting between PSG fans and the police. The violence occurred after PSG lost 4‚Äì2 to Israeli club Hapoel Tel Aviv at the Parc des Prince in a UEFA Cup match. PSG fans chased a fan of Hapoel Tel Aviv, shouting racist and anti-Semitic slogans. A plainclothes police officer who tried to protect the Hapoel fan was attacked, and in the chaos, one fan was shot dead and another seriously injured. In response, the French Interior Minister, Nicolas Sarkozy held a meeting with the president of the French Football League, Frederic Thiriez to discuss racism and violence in football. The director-general of the French police, Michel Gaudin, insisted that measures against football hooliganism had reduced racist incidents to six that season from nineteen in the previous season. Gaudin also stated that 300 known hooligans could be banned from matches. The fan who was shot, was linked with the Boulogne Boys, a group of fans who modelled themselves on British hooligans in the 1980s. The group's name comes from the Kop of Boulogne (KOB), one of the two main home fan stand at the Parc des Princes. The KOB themselves held a silent memorial march attended by 300 and accused the police office of murdering the fan. They cited bias in the French press who had only given a \\"one-sided\\" account of the incident. French President Jacques Chirac condemned violence that led up to the shooting, stating that he was horrified by the reports of racism and anti-Semitism. French Prime Minister, Dominique de Villepin called for new, tougher measures to deal with football hooligans. Prosecutors opened an inquiry into the incident, to determine whether the officer involved should face criminal charges. FC Berlin with masked faces in a match between FC Carl Zeiss Jena and FC Berlin in April 1990. Before a home match against Sochaux on 4 January 2006, two Arab youths were punched and kicked by white fans outside the entrance to the KOB. During the match racist insults were aimed at black players and a PSG player of Indian origin, Vikash Dhorasoo was told to \\"go sell peanuts in the metro\\". In the recent years, following UK's example, France's legislation has changed, including more and more banning of violent fans from stadiums. The threat of dissolution of fan groups has also tempered the outward rivalry and violence of a number of fans. Known violent fans under ban sentences are to report to the nearest Police station on nights of game, to prove they are not anywhere in proximity to the stadium. On 11 June 2016, during a Euro 2016 match in Marseille between Russia and England, violent conflict broke out between the fans and left 35 injured. Both threw numerous items at each other and engaged in physical combat. Even a person who is recording the incident can be seen stomping another person's head. Because of this, both countries were given a disqualification warning soon later. The match ended with 1‚Äì1. On 16 April 2017, during a match between Olympique Lyonnais and SC Bastia, supporters of SC Bastia invaded the pitch in an attempt to fight Lyonnais players. The match was then postponed. =Germany= Some football hooliganism in Germany has been linked to neo- Nazism and far right groups. In June 1998, after a FIFA World Cup match in France between Germany and Yugoslavia a French policeman was beaten to the point of brain damage by German fans. Following the incident, German police contacted many of the known 2,000+ German hooligans to warn them they would be arrested if they travelled to upcoming matches in France. A German fan was arrested in 1998 and charged with attempted murder and in 1999, four more Germans were convicted in the attackThe main defendant, Andre Zawacki, was found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to ten years in jail. The other three defendants were convicted of grievous bodily harm and given jail sentences of between six months and three-and-a-half years. In 2001, Markus Warnecke, the German fan who was accused of leading the attack, was found guilty and jailed for five years and banned from France for ten years, and from all sports facilities for five years. German police prepare for hooliganism by wearing riot gear and using police dogs. In March 2005, German football fans fought with police and rival fans at a friendly match between Germany and Slovenia in Celje, Slovenia, damaging cars and shops, and shouting racist slogans. The German Football Association (DFB) apologised for the behaviour. As a result, 52 people were arrested; 40 Germans and 12 Slovenians. Following a 2‚Äì0 defeat to Slovakia in Bratislava, Slovakia, German hooligans fought with the local police, and six people were injured and two were taken into custody. The DFB again apologised for fans who chanted racist slogans. In June 2006, Germany beat Poland in a World Cup match in Dortmund, which led to violent clashes. The police detained over 300 people in Dortmund and German fans threw chairs, bottles and fireworks at the police. Of the 300 arrested, 120 were known hooligans. In October 2006, a task force was established to deal with violence and racism in German football stadiums.Theo Zwanziger (president of the DFB) and Werner Hackmann (president of Bundesliga) held a crisis meeting following violence at several German lower-division matches The worst incident took place at a Third division (North) match between the Hertha BSC Berlin B-team and Dynamo Dresden, in which 23 policemen were injured.Dynamo Dresden fans tried to invade the pitch, and threw missiles (including gas cartridges and plastic seats) at police. The police responded with batons and pepper spray. At a Second Division match between FC Augsburg and 1860 Munich, 21 people were arrested and police used pepper spray to disperse fans. In addition, 70 amateur and youth matches in Siegen- Wittgenstein were called off when referees refused to take to the pitch, fearing for their safety. In February 2007 in Saxony, all German lower league matches, from the fifth division downward were cancelled after about 800 fans attacked 300 police officers (injuring 39 of them) after a match between Lokomotive Leipzig and Erzgebirge Aue II. There were minor disturbances after the Germany and England match during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. An English flag was burned down amongst a mob of German supporters in Duisburg-Hamborn in Germany. =Greece= Hooligans of \\"GATE 13\\" Panathinaiko's attacking supporters of \\"GATE 4\\" Paok and punched in field of Leoforos Alexandras stadium. The first incidents between Football fans in Greece were recorded in June 1930, after the match between Aris Thessaloniki and Panathinaikos F.C. at Thessaloniki. While Panathinaikos fans where arriving at the port of Piraeus from Thessaloniki, Olympiakos fans, who had not forgotten the big loss of their team (8‚Äì2) by Panathinaikos F.C. rioted with the green fans. The word \\"hooliganism\\" was recorded at the early '60s where Greek students in the UK who had experienced the phenomenon of hooliganism there first taught the term to the journalists who were unable to explain why the fans were fighting each other and gave this situation a name. In 1962, after Panathinaikos F.C. and P.A.O.K. F.C. match incidents, newspapers wrote for the first time that hooligans (ŒßŒøœçŒªŒπŒ≥Œ∫Œ±ŒΩœÇ) vandalized Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium. It was on 19 November 1966 that a big flag, at the 13th gate of Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium announced the arrival of a new group on the scene. Gate 13 would be the first organized group that over the years became a part of the club by affecting club decisions and by following the club on all possible occasions. P.A.O.K. F.C. fans made Gate 4 in 1978 and Olympiacos fans create the Gate 7 in 1981. In 1982, between Aris FC ‚Äì Paok FC match incidents, Aris Dimitriadis was stabbed and later died in Thessaloniki's hospital. On 26 October 1986, at the Alkazar stadium of Larissa Charalambos Blionas was killed by a flare pistol thrown by the Paok fans. One month later anastasios Zontos was stabbed to death in Omonoia square in the center of Athens before the match AEK Athens F.C. & P.A.O.K. F.C.. In January 1991, before the derby of Aek F.C. and Olympiakos F.C., George Panagiotou died in the incidents between hooligans outside Nea Filadelfia's stadium hit by flare pistol. On 15 May 2005, in Thessaloniki derby Iraklis-Aris F.C., Aris' hooligans called Ierolohites invaded the pitch when the score was 2‚Äì1 for Iraklis. A football player Tasos Katsambis was injured during the clashes. The match was halted and Aris was punished with a 4-point deduction which led to their relegation to the Second Division. In April 2007, all sports stadiums were closed down in Greece for two weeks following the death of a fan in a pre-arranged fight between hooligans in Athens on 29 March. The fight involved 500 fans of rival Super League Greece clubs Panathinaikos, which is based in Athens, and Olympiacos, which is based in nearby Piraeus. The Greek government immediately suspended all team sports in Greece and severed the ties between teams and their supporters' organizations. A Third Division match between Panetolikos and Ilioupoli was stopped for thirty minutes when players and fans clashed following a Panetolikos disallowed goal. Two players and a coach were sent to the hospital. On 18 April, rival fans clashed with each other and riot police in Ioannina during and after a Greek Cup semi-final match between local rivals PAS Giannena and Larissa. There was trouble during the game in which Larissa won 2‚Äì0. Fans set fire to rubbish bins and smashed shop windows, while police tried to disperse them by firing tear gas. On 10 October 2009, a group of about 30 hooligans disrupted an \\"Under 17\\" match between local rivals PAOK and Aris Thessaloniki. Among the injured were a group of Aris Thessaloniki players and their coach, a veteran PAOK player and another official. On 7 October 2011, a group of Greek supporters firebombed the away section of a Euro 2012 qualifying match against Croatia in Athens. On 18 March 2012, during the match for the Super League Greek Championship in Athens Olympic Stadium between Panathinaikos and Olympiakos, home team Panathinaikos's fans who were inside the stadium attacked police forces with Molotov bombs, causing extended damages to the stadium, while police forces were unable to keep peace. Panathinaikos fans burn \\"spoils\\" inside stadium which were gained in battles against hooligans of Olympiakos in the past year. On 5 January 2014, in Aigaleo, a suburb in Athens, the local team Aigaleo FC was hosting AEK Athens, a Third Division match. Before the match clashes broke up between AEK and Aigaleo fans. Indeed, the clashes resulted in the arrest of a security guard of the stadium who was accused of participating in the clashes among Aigaleo hooligans and also accused of committing attempted murder against an AEK fan. On 15 September 2014, in Nea Alikarnassos, the team Herodotus:el:Œ†.Œë.Œ£.Œë. ŒóœÅœåŒ¥ŒøœÑŒøœÇ was hosting Ethnikos Piraeus , a Third Division match. On 75' minute of the game, a clash between the supporters of the two clubs forced the referee to stop the match. During the clash, a 45-year-old supporter of Ethnikos Piraeus suffered a severe head injury and died two weeks later. =Hungary= Local derbies between Budapest teams Ferencv√°rosi Torna Club (based in Ferencv√°ros) and √öjpest FC (based in √öjpest) are frequently occasions for violence between supporters. Other clubs whose supporters are reportedly involved in hooliganism include Debreceni VSC (Debrecen), Di√≥sgy≈ëri VTK (Miskolc), Ny√≠regyh√°za Spartacus FC (Ny√≠regyh√°za), Zalaegerszegi TE (Zalaegerszeg), Halad√°s VSE (Szombathely) and Videoton FC (Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r) =Italy= The term ultr√† or ultras is used to describe hooligans in Italy. In February 2001, A.S. Roma fans fought with police and Liverpool F.C. fans, and five English supporters were stabbed. After a weekend of violence in January 2007, the president of the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) threatened to halt all league football. An official of amateur club Sammartinese died when he was caught up in a fight between players and fans in Luzzi, among numerous incidents of disorder in Florence, Bergamo and elsewhere. In February 2007, the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) suspended all football matches after Police Officer Filippo Raciti was killed due to liver damage from blunt object trauma when football violence broke out at a Serie A match between Catania and Palermo. =Montenegro= In a Euro 2016 qualifying match in Podgorica on 27 March 2015, a few seconds in, a hooligan threw a flare at Russia goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev injuring him. The match was then temporarily suspended. Later fighting between the teams and more hooliganism rendered the game abandoned. In March 2019, during a Euro 2020 qualifying match between Montenegro and England, several England players including Danny Rose, Raheem Sterling and Callum Hudson-Odoi were allegedly subjected to monkey chants from Montenegro fans. =Netherlands= The earliest recorded case of hooliganism in the Netherlands occurred when Rotterdam club Feyenoord and English club Tottenham Hotspur met at the 1974 UEFA Cup Final, where Tottenham hooligans destroyed portions of the Feyenoord stadium tribunes. It was the first time the Netherlands encountered such destructive hooliganism. Other Dutch clubs associated with hooliganism include PSV Eindhoven, Ajax, FC Utrecht, FC Groningen, Twente Enschede and ADO Den Haag. The most violent rivalry is between Ajax and Feyenoord. A particularly serious incident was the so-called \\"Battle of Beverwijk\\" on 23 March 1997, in which several people were seriously injured and one killed. The 2002‚Äì03 season was marked by similar incidents, and also by fighting between fans of Ajax and FC Utrecht. PSV's Philips Stadion Other serious incidents include: * 16 June 1990, English fans were arrested for brawling before a World Cup match against the Netherlands in Italy. * 26 April 1999, 80 hooligans were arrested for rioting after Feyenoord won the title after having played NAC Breda. *19 February 2015, Feyenoord hooligans attacked Italian police with glass bottles and firecrackers in Piazza di Spagna before Europa League match A.S. Roma- Feyenoord,28 Dutch fans were arrested. =Poland= One of the biggest riots occurred at a World Cup qualifying match between Poland and England on 29 May 1993 in Chorz√≥w. Arranged football hooligan fights in Poland are known as ustawki; they have become common in Poland since the late 90s. On 30 March 2003, Polish police arrested 120 people after rival football supporters fought during a match between ≈ölƒÖsk Wroc≈Çaw and Arka Gdynia. During the riot, hooligans pelted police officers with stones and fought a running battle with knives and axes. One victim was seriously injured and later died in hospital. During the 1998‚Äì99 UEFA Cup, a knife was thrown at Italian footballer Dino Baggio, from Parma F.C. by Polish supporters (allegedly Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w fans), injuring his head. Supporters of Legia Warszawa also attracted negative attention after in Lithuania during the match against Vetra Vilnius on 10 July 2007. The most notable hooligan incidents happened in Krak√≥w where supporters of the Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w and KS Cracovia teams have a rivalry that reportedly extended to killings of opposing fans. Country-wide riots involving football fans were seen in 1998 in S≈Çupsk and 2015 in Knur√≥w, both incidents sparked by a killing of a fan by the police. =Republic of Ireland= On 15 July 2019 a League of Ireland match was the scene of crowd trouble following a match between Dublin clubs UCD and Bohemians. Missiles were thrown from the crowd where the referee and players had to be escorted away. =Russia= Spartak Moscow Football hooliganism has become prevalent in Russia since the beginning of the 2000s, Hooligans are associated with teams such as FC Spartak Moscow (Gladiators, Shkola, Union), FC Lokomotiv Moscow (Red-Green's, Vikings, BHZ, Trains Team), PFC CSKA Moscow (RBW, Gallant Steeds, Yaroslavka, Einfach Jugend), FC Dynamo Moscow (Capitals, 9-ka), FC Torpedo Moscow (Tubes, TroubleMakers) ‚Äì all from Moscow ‚Äì and FC Zenit Saint Petersburg (Music Hall, Coalition, Snakes Firm) from Saint Petersburg. Russian hooligans often show an underlying resentment towards Russia's perceived political rivals. At the UEFA Euro 2016 tournament, 50 Russian fans were deported and the international team fined ‚Ç¨150,000 following co-ordinated violent attacks. The aftermath of a football riot in Bryansk, Russia: broken chairs and seats. =Serbia= Red Star in Serbia provokes more support as refusing with mild condemnations, amnesties and graffitis The most prominent groups of hooligans are associated with Belgrade and Serbia's two main clubs, Red Star Belgrade and Partizan Belgrade. They are known as the Delije (\\"Heroes\\") and Grobari (\\"Gravediggers\\"), respectively. FK Rad is a less-successful Belgrade club, whose associated hooligans, known locally as \\"United Force\\", have notoriously been involved in many violent incidents. On 2 December 2007, a plainclothes police officer was seriously injured when he was attacked during a Serbian Superliga match between Red Star Belgrade and Hajduk Kula.The officer was attacked with burning flares and broken seats and he had to fire warning shots in the air in self-defence. He was treated for burns, cuts and bruises in a nearby hospital. The following day, the Football Association of Serbia requested government help to help crack down on football hooliganism in the country. On 14 April 2008 a football fan was killed near Novi Sad after clashes between FK Partizan's Grobari and fans of FK Vojvodina. That same week, after a Red Star Belgrade-Partizan cup match, three people were injured and a bus destroyed by hooligans. Football firm graffiti in Prague. On 19 September 2008 a Serbian football hooligan was sentenced to ten years in jail for an attack against a police officer at a Red Star Belgrade‚ÄìHajduk Kula game. On 12 October 2010 Serbia's Euro 2012 Qualifying clash with Italy was abandoned after only 6 minutes after several Serbian fans threw flares and fireworks onto the pitch and caused severe trouble in and out of the ground. Partizan Belgrade were disqualified from the UEFA Cup, after crowd trouble in Mostar, Bosnia & Herzegovina. Partizan fans threw flares and stones and fought with supporters of Zrinjski Mostar and police. Fourteen Partizan fans were convicted for the murder of Toulouse FC fan Brice Taton in Belgrade. They attacked him and other fans with baseball bats and flares while wearing surgical masks. The hooligans received up to 35 years in prison. =Spain= Football hooliganism in Spain arises from three main sources. The first is racism, as some black players have been victims of ethnic slurs. Samuel Eto'o, a former FC Barcelona player from Cameroon, has denounced the problem. Many black foreign players have been racially abused, such as at a 2004 friendly match between Spain and England, in which black England players such as Shaun Wright-Phillips and Ashley Cole endured monkey chants from Spain supporters. The second source is the strong rivalry between Real Madrid and Barcelona. After transferring from Barcelona to Real Madrid, Lu√≠s Figo's appearance in Barcelona's Nou Camp stadium triggered a strong reaction: the crowd threw bottles, mobile phones and other objects (including a pig's head). Although nobody was injured the match was followed by a large discussion on fan violence in the Spanish Primera Divisi√≥n. Hooliganism is also rooted in deep political divisions arising from the General Franco fascist regime days (some Real Madrid, Atl√©tico Madrid, Espanyol, Real Betis and Valencia ultras are linked to franquista groups), others with communist leanings (such as Deportivo La Coru√±a, Athletic Bilbao, Sevilla, Celta de Vigo, Rayo Vallecano) and the independence movements in Catalonia, Galicia and the Basque region. In Spain, organized hooligan groups are popularly called grupos ultra. Three notorious ones are the Boixos Nois, the Frente Atl√©tico and the Ultras Sur, supporter groups of FC Barcelona, Atl√©tico Madrid and Real Madrid respectively.Spain‚Äôs soccer hooligan map, El Pa√≠s, 12 December 2014 There also have been local or regional disputes between rival teams, for example between C√°diz and Xerez, Betis and Sevilla, Osasuna and Real Zaragoza, or Deportivo de La Coru√±a and Celta. In 1991, Frederiq Roiquier, a French supporter of Espanyol was killed by FC Barcelona hooligans who mistook him for a rival hooligan. In 1992, a 13-year-old child died at Espanyol's stadium after being struck by a flare. In 1998, Aitor Zabaleta, a supporter of Real Sociedad, was killed by an Atl√©tico Madrid hooligan who was linked to a neo-Nazi group (Basti√≥n), just before a match between these two teams. In 2003, a supporter of Deportivo La Coru√±a was killed in riots by hooligans following his club, when he tried to protect a supporter of the opposing team, SD Compostela. Since then, authorities have made attempts to bring hooliganism under control. In 2007, there were acts of hooliganism before a match between Atl√©tico Madrid and Real Madrid, with several cars being destroyed and policemen injured by flares and bottles which were thrown at them. Hooligan violence in Spain has decreased since the late 1990s due to an alcohol ban in sporting events as well as hooligan laws which attempt fines up to 600,000 euros and stadium bans. Since 2003 the FC Barcelona hooligans, the Boixos Nois, are not allowed to enter Camp Nou. The hardcore Barcelona hooligans subgroups were involved in police operations against organized crime. In 2008, after a hooligan incident versus Espanyol, FC Barcelona very publicly took a stand on violence, saying it hoped to stamp out violence for good. In 2007 Atl√©tico Madrid hooligans clashed with Aberdeen FC hooligans prior to a UEFA Cup match. In 2009 and 2010, Atl√©tico hooligans also clashed with FC Porto and Sporting Clube de Portugal groups in Portugal during UEFA Cup games. During crowd disorder control manoeuvres after a match between Athletic Bilbao and FC Schalke 04, home supporter {Interlanguage linkI√±igo CabacaseuI√±igo Cabacas auziavertical-align=sup}} (who was not involved in hooliganism) {was shot in the head with a 'Flash-ball' fired by a member of the Ertzaintza police service and later died. Later that year a Rayo Vallecano hooligan was arrested during riots in the 14 November general strike and accused of terrorism. In 2014, debate about eradicating Spanish hooligans arose after Frente Atl√©tico members caused the death of a Riazor Blues (Deportivo La Coru√±a radicals) member by throwing him into the Manzanares river;Depor fan dead after clash between ‚Äòultras‚Äô ahead of Atl√©tico match, El Pa√≠s, 1 December 2014 and after members of the Boixos Nois stabbed two PSG supporters in Barcelona. In 2016, football-related violence came once again to the public debate after a fight between Sevilla and Junventus supporters that occurred the day before their UEFA Champions League group stage match. Two Juventus supporters were stabbed (one of them was seriously injured but survived after being hospitalised) and a Sevilla supporter was hospitalized with head wounds caused by a glass bottle. Similarly, clashes between Spartak Moscow and Athletic Bilbao fans in 2018 received wider attention when one of the police officers involved in controlling the situation collapsed and died. =Sweden= Hooliganism began in Sweden in the early 20th century among fans of AIK, Hammarby and Djurg√•rden who clashed after derbies in Stockholm. Modern hooliganism began in 1970 when fans of IFK G√∂teborg invaded the pitch, destroyed the goalposts and fought the police at the end of a match that relegated G√∂teborg from the Allsvenskan. Hooliganism in Sweden became a growing problem in the 1980s, but pitch invasions and violence at football grounds decreased in the late 1990s; when hooligan firms started pre-arranging their fights away from the grounds and the regular supporters. Seven clubs that have large organised hooligans firms are AIK (Firman Boys), IFK G√∂teborg (Wisemen) Djurg√•rdens IF (DFG) Hammarby IF (KGB) Malm√∂ FF (True Rockers) GAIS (G√§rningsm√§nnen) and Helsingborgs IF (Frontline). But several other football, bandy and ice hockey clubs have active hooligan followings. In November 2002, 12 members of the Wisemen stood trial for inflicting life-threatening injuries on a Hammarby fan in 2001. In August 2002, Tony Deogan, a member of the Wisemen, was killed after a pre- arranged fight against Firman Boys. A second fatality occurred in March 2014, when a 43-year-old Djurg√•rden supporter was killed in Helsingborg in an assault on his way to Djurg√•rden's opening match in the 2014 Allsvenskan against Helsingborg. After the man's death became known, Djurg√•rden supporters invaded the pitch after 42 minutes of play, prompting officials to abandon the match. =Switzerland= In Switzerland, hooligan incidents are rare due to the fact that the stadiums are small. One incident, dubbed the 2006 Basel Hooligan Incident, 13 May 2006, occurred on the last day of the 2005‚Äì06 season, when FC Z√ºrich defeated FC Basel at St. Jakob Park to win the Swiss championship with a last-minute goal. After the final whistle, angry Basel hooligans stormed the field and attacked Z√ºrich players. The Z√ºrich team were forced to celebrate in the upper deck of the stands while the fighting continued. There was similar fighting in the streets that night. =Turkey= According to the Turkish Daily News, hooligan groups are well organised, have their own \\"leaders\\", and often consist of organised street fighters. These groups have a \\"racon\\" (code of conduct), which states that the intention must be to injure rather than kill and that a stab must be made below the waist. Other hooligans have fired firearms into the air to celebrate their team's victory, which has been known to accidentally kill innocent people watching the celebrations on their balconies. Trouble has arisen during matches between Istanbul rivals Galatasaray and Fenerbah√ße. However, the Turkish Football Federation has tightened security to try to contain the hooliganism. During the 2005 Turkish cup final between Galatasaray and Fenerbah√ße, 8,000 police, stewards and officials were employed to prevent violence. In 2006, the Turkish Football Federation introduced new measures to combat the threat of hooliganism and have made new regulations that allow the Professional Football Disciplinary Board to fine clubs up to YTL 250,000 for their fans' behavior. Repeat offenders could be fined up to YTL 500,000. Despite reports from the Turkish Football Federation, the Turkish police believe that football hooliganism is not a major threat and is \\"isolated incidents\\". Before Galatasaray's semi-final UEFA Cup match with Leeds United in 2000, two Leeds fans, Christopher Loftus and Kevin Speight, were stabbed to death in Istanbul following street fights between Turkish and British hooligans. UEFA allowed the game to proceed and Galatasaray won, 2‚Äì0. Leeds complained because home fans jeered while a message of condolence was read for the victims. Galatasaray's players refused to wear black arm bands. The Leeds chairman at the time, Peter Ridsdale, accused Galatasaray of \\"showing a lack of respect\\". He also revealed that his team's players had received death threats before the match. Ali √úmit Demir was arrested and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for the stabbing, but the sentence was reduced to 5 years on the basis of heavy provocation, while five others were given lesser sentences of under four months. The families of those accused of attacking with knives are reported to have defended their actions and approved of their children punishing the \\"rude British people\\". Galatasaray fans were banned from traveling to the return match to try to avoid further clashes between fans, although there were reports of attacks by Leeds fans on Turkish television crews and the police. However, the Assistant Chief Constable in charge of policing the game believed that the number of arrests was \\"no worse than a normal high category game\\". Hakan ≈û√ºk√ºr was hit with projectiles from Leeds United supporters and the Galatasaray team bus was stoned after driving through an underpass. The game saw Emre Bel√∂zoƒülu and Harry Kewell sent off and Galatasaray sealed their way to the final with a 2‚Äì2 score. Violence also occurred between Arsenal fans (mainly from The Herd) and Galatasaray fans before the 2000 UEFA Cup final in Copenhagen in which a Galatasaray fan, an Arsenal fan and a Dane were said to have been stabbed. Galatasaray later won the match after a penalty shoot-out. On 24 May 2001, 50 people were injured when fighting broke out at a match between French club PSG and Galatasaray at the Parc des Princes stadium.[16][17]PSG were initially given a record $571,000 fine, but it was reduced on appeal to $114,000. Galatasaray was initially fined $114,000 by UEFA, but it too was eventually reduced to $28,500.[18] In May 2001, six PSG fans from the Supporters Club, were arrested and charged with assault, carrying weapons, throwing items on the pitch and racism. The six were alleged to have deliberately entered a part of the Parc des Princes stadium where French fans of Turkish origin were standing, in order to attack them. The six were banned from all football stadiums for the duration of their trial. On 3 June 2011, after the Belgium vs. Turkey match, several riots occurred in the city center of Ghent after a 1‚Äì1 draw. 30 people were injured. During the 2003‚Äì2004 season, a Second League Category A, match between Kar≈üƒ±yaka and G√∂ztepe on 8 February 2004, involved rival Kar≈üƒ±yaka and G√∂ztepe supporters clashing and the match was subsequently stopped for 33 minutes. This was due to Kar≈üƒ±yaka leading 5‚Äì2 after coming back from a 2‚Äì0 deficit. After the match, G√∂ztepe fans clashed with the police, seven police officers were wounded and fifteen G√∂ztepe fans were arrested. Bursaspor fans clashed with policemen at a match against Samsunspor match in the S√ºper Lig in Adapazarƒ± at the end of the 2003‚Äì04 season. The match was played in Adapazarƒ± due to events at a previous match between Bursaspor and √áaykur Rizespor. Bursaspor were playing to avoid relegation. Bursaspor won 1‚Äì0 the but were relegated to Category A after rivals won. After the match, Bursaspor fans ripped out and threw seats at the Sakarya Atat√ºrk Stadium They also fought with craftsmen of G√∂lc√ºk during their journey to Adapazarƒ±. The Bursaspor-Diyarbakƒ±rspor game in March 2010 was suspended in the 17th minute after Diyarbakƒ±rspor supporters threw objects on the field. One object struck and knocked down an assistant referee. On 7 May 2011, Bursaspor supporters clashed with the police ahead of the team's match with rival Be≈üikta≈ü. 25 police officers and 9 fans were injured in the violence. During the Fenerbah√ße-Galatasaray game at the end of 2011‚Äì2012 season Fenerbah√ße fans clashed with the police, causing $2 million of damage. The 1967 Kayseri Atat√ºrk Stadium disaster was the worst hooliganism event in Turkish history. It resulted in 40 deaths and 600 injuries. The violence started following provocation by the Kayserispor fans at half-time, after Kayserispor took the lead in the first half. Supporters of the two teams, some of them armed with bats and knives, began to throw rocks at each other, and fans fleeing the violence caused a stampede in front of the stand exits. The events in the stadium were followed by vandalism in Kayseri and days of riots in Sivas. On 13 May 2013, a Fenerbahce fan was stabbed to death after the Istanbul derby. The Fenerbahce fan was on his way back home after the match between Fenerbah√ße and Galatasaray, when he was attacked by a group of Galatasaray fans at a bus stop, and died in hospital later. In 2015, confectioners √úlker‚Äîpreviously \\"one of Turkish football's biggest sponsors\\"‚Äîceased their support, reportedly due to \\"low crowds, violence and poor atmosphere at matches\\". =United Kingdom= There are records of football hooliganism in the UK from the 1880s, and from no later than the 1960s the UK had a worldwide reputation for it ‚Äì the phenomenon was often dubbed the English Disease. From the 1970s, many organised hooligan firms sprang up, with most Football League clubs having at least one known organised hooligan element. Hooliganism was often at its worst when local rivals played each other. Supporters of teams including Arsenal, Chelsea, Aston Villa, Leeds United, Millwall, Birmingham City, Tottenham Hotspur, Portsmouth, Sunderland A.F.C., Newcastle United, West Ham United, Leicester City, Bristol City, Wolverhampton Wanderers, and Cardiff City were among those most frequently linked to hooliganism. Racism became a major factor in hooliganism around the same time, as black players appeared regularly on English league teams from the 1970s. Black players were frequently targeted with monkey chants, and had bananas thrown at them. Members of far-right groups including the National Front also sprayed racist slogans and distributed racist literature at matches. Sectarian violence has long been a regular factor of crowd violence, as well as offensive chanting, at matches in Scotland between Celtic and Rangers. As a result of the Heysel Stadium disaster at Brussels, Belgium, in 1985 between Juventus and Liverpool, where rioting Liverpool fans led to the death of 39 Juventus fans, English clubs were banned from all European competitions until 1990, with Liverpool banned for an additional year. Many of the football hooligan gangs in the UK used hooliganism as a cover for acquisitive forms of crime, specifically theft and burglary. In the 1980s and well into the 1990s the UK government led a major crackdown on football- related violence. While football hooliganism has been a growing concern in some other European countries in recent years, British football fans now tend to have a better reputation abroad. Although reports of British football hooliganism still surface, the instances now tend to occur at pre-arranged locations including pubs rather than at the matches themselves. English and Welsh clubs who have made the headlines for the worst and most frequent cases of hooliganism include Birmingham City (whose multi-racial hooligan element gained the nickname \\"Zulus\\" from fans of rival teams in the 1970s when football hooligans were almost always White British), Chelsea (whose then chairman Ken Bates installed an electric fence at the club's stadium in the mid 1980s to combat hooligans, but was refused permission to switch it on during matches), Leeds United (who were banned from European competitions following a riot after the 1975 European Cup final against Bayern M√ºnchen), Liverpool (14 of whose fans were convicted after a riot at the 1985 European Cup final resulted in the deaths of 39 spectators at Heysel Stadium in Belgium when a stadium wall collapsed, leading to English clubs being banned from European competitions for 5 years), Manchester United (who were booted out of the European Cup Winner's Cup in 1977 after their fans rioted at a game in France, although they were reinstated to the competition on appeal), Millwall (whose most notorious hooliganism incident was in 1985 when their fans rioted in an FA Cup tie at Luton), Tottenham Hotspur who gained notoriety for the 1974 UEFA Cup Final disturbances and again in Rotterdam in 1983 (who had a section of fans banned from all football grounds in England in 2008 for their racial and homophobic abuse of former player Sol Campbell), Wolves (who had dozens of fans convicted of incidents in the late 1980s involving the Subway Army hooligan firm at matches against teams including Cardiff City and Scarborough when they were in the Fourth Division), and Cardiff City whose hooligan element, known as the Soul Crew, is one of the most infamous football hooligan firms. In March 2002, the Seaburn Casuals (a Sunderland A.F.C. firm) fought with hooligans from the Newcastle Gremlins in a pre-arranged clash near the North Shields Ferry terminal, in what was described as \\"some of the worst football related fighting ever witnessed in the United Kingdom\\". The leaders of the Gremlins and Casuals were both jailed for four years for conspiracy, with 28 others jailed for various terms, based on evidence gained after police examined the messages sent by mobile phone between the gang members on the day. = Ukraine = Football hooliganism in Ukraine started in the 1980s. The first big fight (more than 800 people) involving football hooligans occurred in September 1987 between Dynamo Kyiv and Spartak Moscow fans in the center of Kyiv. The 1990s passed in relative silence, as there were no big fights between hooligans. On 5 September 1998 an important game between Ukraine and Russia's national football teams was played. Ukrainian hooligans began to unite in \\"national crews\\" to resist Russian fans. However, the mass union did not take place due to police intervention and were mainly composed of Ukrainian fans from Kyiv and Dnipropetrovsk. In March 2001, several crews united and attacked 80 Belarusian fans after match between Ukraine and Belarus national football teams. At that exact time hooligans and ultras were separated, due to changes of views on supporting movement. On 15 April 2002 about 50 right-wing Dynamo fans attacked the Jewish quarter in Kyiv, targeting local businesses, the synagogue, and Jewish worshipers. Since 2005 clashes between hooligans have occurred mostly outside the city because of a greater police presence. During Euro 2012 several leaders of football hooligans came under government pressure. During the 2014 Ukrainian revolution the unification of all fans was announced and a ban was imposed on any provocation, such as burning attributes, fighting, or offensive songs. During the war in eastern Ukraine many hooligans and ultras went to the defense of the state. Ukrainian hooligans have also been involved in incidents with foreign clubs. After the match between FC Dnipro and Saint Etienne in Kyiv several French fans were hospitalized after stabbings. On 20 August 2015 there was a big fight in Hydropark between hooligans from Legia Warsaw and from Dynamo and Zorya hooligans. The biggest clash since unification occurred in Kyiv, 6 December 2016 between Dynamo and Besiktas hooligans. A few days before Kyiv about 7,000 fans arrived from Istanbul. Two days before the match, different parts of Ukrainian capital witnessed the outbreak of numerous conflicts on the streets. Typically the biggest confrontations involving Ukrainian hooligans occur in domestic competitions. The most famous confrontations are the Klasychne derby, South derby and South-West derby between FC Karpaty Lviv and Shakhtar Donetsk, as well as local derbys such as the Donetsk derby and the Kyiv derby. South America =Argentina= 1920s The first murder related to Argentine football occurred on 21 September 1922 in Rosario, during the second half of a home match of Tiro Federal Argentino and Newell's Old Boys for the Copa Est√≠mulo of the local first division, in a discussion between two fans. Enrique Battcock, a railroad worker and supporter of the home club (also former footballer and former member of the club's directing) was interpellated for Francisco Camp√° (Newell's Old Boys' supporter and member of the club's directing) for his behaviour, which carried a discussion that ended when Battcock hit in the face to Camb√°, who retired from the stadium, returned after a little while, extracted a gun and shot him, causing Battcock's death.Victims list Salvemos al F√∫tbol Another murder occurred in Montevideo on 2 November 1924 when Boca Juniors supporter Jos√© L√°zaro Rodr√≠guez shot and killed Uruguayan fan Pedro Demby after the final match of the South American Championship between Argentina and Uruguay, which Uruguay won.To 85 years of the death of Pedro Demby Pelota Afuera 1930s On 14 May 1939 at the stadium of Lan√∫s in Greater Buenos Aires), in a match between the minor divisions of the home team and Boca Juniors, both teams began to fight after a foul committed by a Lan√∫s player. Seeing this, Boca Juniors fans attempted to tear down the fence and invade the pitch, prompting the police to fire shots to disperse them, killing two spectators: Luis L√≥pez and Oscar Munitoli (a 9-year-old).An undesirable list who grow... La Naci√≥n 1940s But this violence was not only among fans, footballers or the police, but also against the referees. On 27 October 1946, during a match between Newell's Old Boys and San Lorenzo de Almagro at Newell's Old Boys stadium (in the city of Rosario), local fans tried to strangle the referee Osvaldo Cossio. The match was tied 2-2 when Cossio disallowed a goal by Newell's, and San Lorenzo de Almagro scored in the next play, aggravating the Newell's supporters. 89 minutes into the game, several Newell's Old Boys fans entered the pitch, hit the umpire and tried to hang him with his own belt.The shortest match of the history La Capital 1950s Although violence in Argentine football was already present from the beginning, organized groups called barras bravas began to appear in the 1950s (for example, Independiente, San Lorenzo de Almagro, Lan√∫s, Rosario Central, V√©lez Sarsfield, Racing) and 1960s (for example, Belgrano, Boca Juniors, River Plate), and continued to grow in the coming decades. With time, every football club in Argentina started to have its own barra brava of violent supporters. Argentine hooligans are reputed to be the most dangerous organized supporter groups in the world, and the most powerful of them are the barras bravas of Independiente (La barra del Rojo), Boca Juniors and Newell's Old Boys. The journalist Am√≠lcar Romero sets 1958 as the beginning of the current barras bravas (although some had already existed since some years), with the random murder by the police of Mario Alberto Linker (a Boca Juniors supporter -not identified as such- that circumstantially was watching a match between V√©lez S√°rsfield and River Plate at the Jos√© Amalfitani Stadium), that was located in the grandstand of River Plate fans when some of them started a fight and the police threw tear gas grenades, one of which hit to Linker in the chest, causing his death. Before the emergence of these groups, when visiting teams were harassed by rival fans. This prompted the organization of the barras bravas in response to that pressure: In this way, each club began having its own barra brava funded by the leaders of the institution. These groups were given their tickets and paid trips to the stadium. For the barra brava to be prestigious, it had to be violent, so they began to increase the level of violence.The origins of an evil without remedy Clar√≠n, especial \\"Violencia en el f√∫tbol\\" After the death of Linker, Argentine football began a phase marked by \\"habituation\\" to the violence of the barras bravas, and an increase in the number of deaths. According to Am√≠lcar Romero, between 1958 and 1985, 103 deaths related to football violence took place in Argentina, an average of one every three months. However, the origin of such deaths is not always confrontation in the stadium, and range from the premeditated clash between barras bravas outside the sporting venues, police repression against disorder, infighting in a barra brava or \\"accidents\\". 1960s In 1964 more than 300 football fans died and another 500 were injured in Lima, Peru in a riot during an Olympic qualifying match between Argentina and Peru on 24 May. On 11 April 1967 in Argentina, before a match between Hurac√°n and Racing de Avellaneda, a Racing fan of 15 years was murdered by the Hurac√°n barra brava at the Tom√°s Adolfo Duc√≥ stadium.The Souto case EF Deportes Over 70 Boca Juniors fans died in 1968 when crowds attending a Supercl√°sico in Buenos Aires stampeded after youths threw burning paper onto the terraces and the exit was locked. 1980s From the 1980s onwards, the nuclei of the biggest barras bravas began to attend the World Cup matches of the Argentina national football team. That caused fights against supporters of other countries (sometimes were hooligans or ultras) and between the Argentine barras bravas themselves. Also, in the 1980s and the 1990s the highest levels of violence in the history of the Argentine football were recorded, and there was a new phenomenon: the internal fragmentation of the barras bravas. It was produced by the emergence of sub-groups with their own names inside the barras bravas. Sometimes these sub-groups fought among themselves to have the power within the barra brava to which they belonged. An example of the violence of this years was the death of Roberto Basile. Before the start of a match between Boca Juniors and Racing in 1983 in the Bombonera stadium, this Racing supporter died after being pierced in the neck by a flare thrown from the Boca Juniors stand.The lost flare La Redo 1990s In 1997 a member of La Guardia Imperial (barra brava of Racing de Avellaneda) was murdered by an Independiente supporter.Barrabrava jailed for the murder of another supporter Clar√≠n 2000s In 2001, other supporter of Racing was killed, and the barra brava of Independiente was the main suspect.Nobody is taking responsibility and today are football in Racing again Clar√≠n Independiente and Racing (both from the city of Avellaneda, in the Greater Buenos Aires) have a huge rivalry, the second most important in Argentina but maybe the fiercest (notably, their stadiums are only 300 meters apart). The next year, one fan was killed and 12 people injured, including six police officers when fans of Racing Club de Avellaneda and Club Atl√©tico Independiente clashed in February 2002. An Independiente fan was shot dead, and another fan was shot in the back and hospitalized when about 400 rival fans fought outside Racing Clubs Estadio Juan Domingo Per√≥n in Avellaneda before the match. Between 70 and 80 people were arrested as a result. The match started late when Independiente fans threw a smoke bomb at Racing Club goalkeeper, Gustavo Campagnuolo. That same weekend, 30 people were arrested and 10 police officers injured when fighting broke out at a match between Estudiantes de La Plata and Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata in La Plata. A 2002 investigation into football hooliganism in Argentina stated that football violence had become a national crisis, with about 40 people murdered at football matches in the preceding ten years. In the 2002 season, there had been five deaths and dozens of knife and shotgun casualties. At one point the season was suspended and there was widespread social disorder in the country. The first death in 2002 was at a match between fierce rivals Boca Juniors and River Plate. The match was abandoned and one Boca Juniors fan was shot dead. Boca Juniors, one of the largest clubs in Argentina, may have the largest barra brava element in the country (it is similar to the barras bravas of Independiente and River Plate), with their self-styled leader, Rafael Di Zeo, claiming in 2002 that they had over 2,000 members (however there are doubts about the reliability of this information).The Boca group, known as La Doce (The Twelfth) has a long history of violence. In 2002 Diego Maradona was alleged to remain friends with the group's leaders, in spite of their reputation. Argentine hooligans revere Maradona In 2004, while driving up to Rosario to watch their side play Rosario Central, Los Borrachos del Tabl√≥n (River's Barra Bravas) confronted a bus of Newell's firm (one of the big rival firms) on Highway 9, in a battle that killed two Newell's fans. Up to this day, some members of Los Borrachos still face charges because of the deaths. In 2005 a footballer, Carlos Azcurra, was shot and seriously wounded by a police officer, when rival fans rioted during a Primera B Nacional match between local Mendoza rivals (but not a derby) San Mart√≠n de Mendoza and Godoy Cruz Antonio Tomba.At half-time, fans had thrown rocks onto the pitch, and just before the end of the match, fans from both clubs invaded the pitch and started fighting. The players who had stayed on the pitch, including Ezcurra, tried to calm the fans, and he was shot when police tried to stop the fans by firing rubber bullets.BBC NEWS  World  Americas Argentine footballer shot in riot During the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, there was a confrontationAgited early morning Clar√≠n between 6 members of the barra brava of Independiente and 16 members of the barras bravas of Boca Juniors and Defensa y Justicia (both were together) in the Czech Republic (the country where the three barras bravas were housed). As a result of the fight, a supporter of Boca Juniors had to be hospitalized. In 2007, during the match of the promotion/relegation playoff of the 2006‚Äì2007 season between Nueva Chicago and Tigre (in the Nueva Chicago's stadium), broke out a fight between the barras bravas of both teams because, when a penalty was sanctionaty for Tigre (who was winning the match 2‚Äì1, a result that relegated to Nueva Chicago to the Second division) in the 92nd minute, the barra brava of Nueva Chicago invaded the pitch and ran in the direction of the stand occupied by the supporters of Tigre to attack them. After this, were serious riots near the stadium (not only caused by the barras bravas, but also by regular supporters), and as a result of it, a fan of Tigre died.Madness in Mataderos: kill a supporter of Tigre 26 Noticias 2010s On 19 March 2010 in a bar in Rosario, the ex-leader of the Newell's Old Boys barra brava (Roberto \\"Pimpi\\" Camino) was fatally shot.Shot dead to Pimpi Camino, ex leader of the barra brava of Newell's La Capital Camino and his sub-group led the barra brava from 2002 to 2009, when they were expelled from it due to their defeat at the hands of another sub-group, which currently dominates La Hinchada M√°s Popular, the barra brava of Newell's Old Boys.

They act as the main supporters of each club and often sell products and even tickets. They have up to 60,000 members and are often involved in criminal activities other than fights such as drug dealing and threats to players. These fans establish alliances with other \\"torcidas organizadas\\" as they are called such as the alliance between Torcida Mancha Azul (Ava√≠ Futebol Clube), For√ßa Jovem Vasco (CR Vasco da Gama), Galoucura (Atl√©tico Mineiro) and Mancha Verde (SE Palmeiras), the alliance between Torcida Independente (S√£o Paulo F.C.), Torcida Jovem (CR Flamengo), M√°fia Azul (Cruzeiro Esporte Clube) and Le√µes da TUF (Fortaleza Esporte Clube) and some other alliances. The \\"torcidas organizadas\\" are usually bigger and more committed to the spectacle in the stadiums than the English hooligan fans but they often schedule fights against rival groups where many are injured and killed. Fans of local rivals TJP ‚Äì Torcida Jovem Ponte Preta (Associa√ß√£o Atl√©tica Ponte Preta) and TFI -Torcida F√∫ria Independente (Guarani Futebol Clube) clashed and rioted at a match in Campinas in 2002. Violence had been expected, and just before kick-off, fans started fighting. Police tried to intervene but were pelted by stones. As the fighting continued inside the stadium, a railing collapsed and numerous fans fell over 13 ft (four metres) into a pit between the stands and the pitch. Over 30 people were injured. =Uruguay= Following a 5‚Äì0 victory against arch-rivals Nacional in April 2014, Pe√±arol have adopted an increasingly violent attitude in the Uruguayan Clasico. While losing a championship play-off match against Nacional in June 2015, Pe√±arol's fans started a riot that delayed the game by 15 minutes before it was called off. In March 2016, Pablo Montiel ‚Äì a supporter of Nacional ‚Äì was shot to death by Pe√±arol fans while walking in the same neighborhood as Pe√±arol's new stadium. Ignacio Ruglio, a board member of Pe√±arol who have openly spread lies about Nacional, was interrogated by police following the murder of Montiel. In November 2016, the Uruguayan Clasico was cancelled before kick-off after Pe√±arol's supporters started a riot at the Estadio Centenario ‚Äì one supporter was arrested holding a pistol, intended to shoot down Nacional players from the Amsterdam tribune. After winning a Clasico for Pe√±arol in September 2017, team captain Cristian Rodr√≠guez openly called for murdering Nacional fans while celebrating the victory. North America =El Salvador= The Football War (Spanish: La guerra del f√∫tbol), also known as the Soccer War or 100 Hour War, was a brief war fought by El Salvador and Honduras in 1969. It was caused by political conflicts between Hondurans and Salvadorans, namely issues concerning immigration from El Salvador to Honduras. These existing tensions between the two countries coincided with the inflamed rioting during the second North American qualifying round of the 1970 FIFA World Cup. Honduras and El Salvador met in the second North American qualifying round for the 1970 FIFA World Cup. There was fighting between fans at the first game in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa on 8 June 1969, which Honduras won 1‚Äì0. The second game, on 15 June 1969 in the Salvadoran capital of San Salvador, which was won 3‚Äì0 by El Salvador, was followed by even greater violence. A play-off match took place in Mexico City on 26 June 1969. El Salvador won 3‚Äì2 after extra time. The war began on 14 July 1969, when the El Salvadoran military launched an attack against Honduras. The Organization of American States negotiated a cease-fire on the night of 18 July (hence \\"100 Hour War\\"), which took full effect on 20 July. El Salvadoran troops were withdrawn in early August. El Salvador dissolved all ties with Honduras, stating that \\"the government of Honduras has not taken any effective measures to punish these crimes which constitute genocide, nor has it given assurances of indemnification or reparations for the damages caused to Salvadorans\\".Anderson, Thomas P. The War of the Dispossessed: Honduras and El Salvador 1969. p. 105 Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1981. This led to border clashes between the two nations. =Mexico= Football hooliganism in Mexico appears to be low key, but there have been some incidents, such as small-scale fighting between fans of Monterrey and Morelia at a Primera Divisi√≥n match in Monterrey in 2003. In June 1998, one man died and several people were injured when Mexico football fans rioted after Mexico lost to Germany in the World Cup. After the match, hundreds of riot police were brought in to restore order because fans were looting and rioting. Fans then clashed with the police, and many fans were injured or arrested. In March 2014 dozens of Chivas supporters clashed with police during their derby with Atlas. Several police were hospitalized. As a result, Chivas banned all of their supporters for the Clasico against Club America. At the 2015 Gold Cup, Mexican hooligans threw trash and drinks in separate games against Trinidad & Tobago and Panama. =United States= While soccer is traditionally viewed in the United States as a family-friendly event, played by children and supported by parents, some violence does still occur. On 20 July 2008, in a friendly match between Major League Soccer side Columbus Crew and English Premier League club West Ham United, in Columbus, Ohio, a fight broke out between rival fans. Police estimated more than 100 people were involved. An unruly encounter occurred between Toronto FC fans in 2009, upset from a loss in the Trillium Cup, and Columbus Crew fans. One Toronto fan was tasered by Columbus police. That same weekend, a riot was narrowly avoided at a packed Giants Stadium as members of the New York Red Bulls supporters club, Empire Supporters Club (ESC), and members of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority security force clashed over what the ESC claimed was unfair and repeated mistreatment. Clashes also took place in the parking area around the stadium after the game, involving already ejected-for-life North Jersey Firm (NJF) members, and the New Jersey State Police were called to quell the situation. There were several arrests, mostly of known NJF hooligans. A rare moment of violence broke out in Seattle in March 2010 after a pre-season Portland Timbers win in Seattle, when three Sounders fans attacked a Timbers fan, choking and dragging him with his team scarf. On 21 April 2013 in Portland, a Portland Timbers supporter was assaulted by a group of San Jose Earthquakes supporters. While he was sitting in his car, he had taunted his scarf at a group of San Jose Supporters, one of which ran toward him and attacked him through his car window, breaking his car windshield and assaulting him. San Jose's 1906 Ultras were subsequently banned by the club from traveling to away matches. After much debate, the ban was lifted. On 10 August 2015, fans of New York Red Bulls and New York City FC clashed in a brawl outside a pub throwing trash and exchanging blows. On 23 May 2016, fans of both NYC FC and New York Red Bulls rioted outside Yankee Stadium in response to NYC FC's 7‚Äì0 defeat to the New York Red Bulls. However, football (soccer) and other sports hooliganism overall is rare in the United States in part because of stricter legal penalties for vandalism and physical violence, club markets having their own territory of fans, venues banning weapons, stricter security during games, and a stronger taboo on politics, class, race, and religion into the American sporting culture. Although isolated drunken fights at games do occur, they rarely escalate to major brawling comparable to Europe and Latin America. East Asia =China= Football hooliganism in China is often linked to accusations of corrupt refereeing, with Chinese football being plagued by allegations of match fixing in the early 2000s. After a match in 2000 between Shaanxi Guoli and Chengdu Wuniu in Xi'an, football fans clashed with police who used tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowd. Eight people were arrested but later released. In March 2002 hundreds of football fans rioted at a match in Xi'an between Shaanxi Guoli and Qingdao Yizhong, as a result of fans' suspicions of match- fixing. Two years earlier, following crowd trouble at a match also in Xi'an, the government demanded more action to stamp out football hooliganism. In June 2002, riots in Fuzhou, Fujian had to be put down by heavily armed paramilitary police. The disorder started when fans were unable to watch the World Cup match between China and Brazil at an outside broadcast. On 4 July 2004 fans rioted in Beijing when China lost 3‚Äì1 to Japan in the final of the AFC Asian Cup. Japanese flags were burned and a Japanese Embassy official's car vandalised. Japanese fans had to be protected by the police, and bussed to safety. The rioting was attributed to ill-feeling toward Japan for atrocities committed before and during the Second World War. =North Korea= There was brief unrest among North Korean fans at an international match against Iran in North Korea in 2005, when a North Korean player got into an argument with the Syrian referee.Andrei Lankov (19 April 2005) \\"North Koreans think the unthinkable\\". Asia Times Online. Retrieved 15 December 2009. South Asia =Bangladesh= Football hooliganism in Bangladesh does not appear to be a major problem. However, in August 2001, 100 people were injured when thousands of football fans rampaged at a B-League match between Mohammedan Sporting Club and Rahmatganj Sporting Club in the Bangabandhu National Stadium, Dhaka. When the referee disallowed a penalty, Mohammedan fans invaded the pitch, throwing stones at the police, who had to fire tear gas at the fans to try and restore order. Outside the stadium dozens of cars and buses were damaged and set on fire. =Nepal= Nepali supporters at Dasarath Stadium tend to act violently during international matches. Cell phones and other objects were thrown during a match against Bangladesh, and coins were hurled at players at a match against Palestine.Somesh Verma (8 March 2013) \\"\\". [eKantipur].

Southeast Asia =Indonesia= Between 1995 and 2018 there have been 70 deaths in Indonesian soccer, 21 deaths of which occurring at the hands of a mob. =Malaysia= Football hooliganism in Malaysia has occurred frequently in league or international matches since 1980, and frequently associated with the hooligan supporters from clubs such as Kedah FA, Kelantan FA, Johor Darul Takzim F.C., Pahang FA, Sarawak FA, Selangor FA and Terengganu FA. During the 2014 AFF Championship, after Malaysia lost 1‚Äì2 to Vietnam, some Malaysian hooligan fans rushed to the Vietnamese supporters' area and began attacking Vietnamese fans, resulting in injuries. After a series of investigation, a number of the hooligan supporters were found to be from the \\"Inter Johor Firm\\", one of the Johor Darul Takzim F.C. supporters and have since been banned from attending any matches. In early 17 May 2015, during the final FA Cup, Singapore LionsXII players and their fans were stranded at the Sultan Mizan Zainal Abidin Stadium for about five hours, after Terengganu fans turned violent over their team's failure to qualify to the Malaysian FA Cup final. Also in the same year on 8 September 2015, the FIFA World Cup qualification match between Malaysia and Saudi Arabia was abandoned after Malaysian hooligan supporters disrupted the match and attacked Saudi supporters. The scoreline before the match was abandoned was 1‚Äì2 in favour of Saudi Arabia. Another incident during the 2017 Southeast Asian Games that were hosted by Malaysia occurred on 21 August when two Myanmar football supporters was assaulted by a group of unidentified assailants after the end of the men's football group match between Malaysia and Myanmar. On 24 November 2018, it is reported that around 20 Myanmar fans, including girls, who were waiting for bus in Kuala Lumpur were attacked by around 30 Malaysians who physically and verbally assaulted the supporters after the end of a group match between Malaysia and Myanmar in the 2018 AFF Championship. According to the Myanmar fans, the attackers shouted \\"babi\\" (pigs) at them as some of them ran off from the scene with those left were injured in the attack and had to be taken to the nearby hospital with the help of a local charity organisation. The girls among the Myanmar fans were kicked at with three of them suffering serious injuries and their mobile phones also grabbed by the attackers. =Myanmar= Hooliganism at Myanmar's football matches is common. On 1 October 2011, FIFA announced that Myanmar would be banned from the 2018 World Cup qualifiers after a home tie against Oman had to be stopped when the crowd pelted the opposition with bottles and rocks. However, the ban was lifted on 7 November 2011 after FIFA reconsidered the appeal made by the Myanmar Football Federation (MFF). During the 2013 Southeast Asian Games which Myanmar hosted, the sudden defeat of Myanmar football team to Indonesia in the group match that caused them failed to qualify the semi-finals led the Myanmar hooligan supporters to tear up seats, hurl stones at officers and burn Southeast Asian Games memorabilia and other billboards. =Thailand= Hooliganism has begun to cast a dark spell on Thai football especially in the 2010s, with several club or international matches were marred with violences. During the 2014 Thai Premier League, the 3‚Äì1 victory of Muangthong United F.C. against Singhtarua F.C. sparked violence between the supporters of the two clubs. Another incident involving Thai supporters following Thai's victory against Vietnam in the 2015 AFF U-19 Youth Championship hosted by Laos began when they set off signal flares, causing the police to fire a warning shot after they entered the stands to quell the unrest and were met with a violent response. Also after their victory in the 2016 AFF Championship, the Football Association of Thailand (FAT) was fined U$30,000 for failing to prevent the hooligan supporters in their own stadium from setting off flares. Despite its cooperation with police in finding and arresting the hooligans, Thailand has been warned that severe punishment will be given if it happens again at any future FIFA or AFC matches. =Vietnam= Shortly after the end of the second leg 2016 AFF Championship semi-finals match in Hanoi between Indonesia and Vietnam, the Indonesian team while on their way back to their hostel was suddenly attacked by angry Vietnamese supporters riding motorcycles who threw two large rocks into their bus following the failure of the Vietnamese national team to qualify for the finals, resulting in minor injuries to an Indonesian goalkeeping coach and their team doctor. A replacement bus was eventually dispatched with heavy security from the Vietnamese authorities following the attacks. The Vietnam Football Federation (VFF) and other Vietnamese fans issued an apology for the incident. West Asia =Israel= In the 2000s, tensions surrounding the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict spilled over into sporadic riots between Jewish and Arab Israeli football fans. In December 2000 it was reported that every club in Israel was on a final warning following escalating violence and intimidation at matches. A number of incidents have involved Beitar Jerusalem, including racist abuse against overseas players, anti-Arab chants, use of smoke bombs and fireworks, and rioting. Beitar has a hooligan firm, La Familia, whose members consider Israeli Arabs to be their enemy. In November 2007 the Israel Football Association (IFA) ordered Beitar to play their game against the Arab club, Bnei Sakhnin behind closed doors after Beitar fans, led by La Familia, broke a minute's silence for former Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin and sang chants in praise of his assassin, Yigal Amir. After a pitch invasion led by La Familia on 13 April 2008, when Beitar were leading Maccabi Herzliya, 1‚Äì0, and about to win the Israeli Premier League, the match was abandoned and the points were awarded to their opponents. Beitar was docked two points and had to play its remaining home games behind closed doors. =Jordan= Football riots in Jordan are generally regarded as an expression of tension between the country's Palestinian ethnic group and those who regard themselves as ethnically Jordanian, the two groups being of roughly equal size. In December 2010, rioting broke out following a game between rival Amman clubs Al-Wehdat and Al- Faisaly clubs. Some Al-Faisali fans threw bottles at Al-Wehdat players and their fans. About 250 people were injured, 243 of them Al-Wehdat fans, according to senior officials from the hospitals. According to Al Jazeera, supporters of Al-Wehdat are generally of Palestinian origin, while Faisaly fans are of Jordanian origin. A similar riot occurred in 2009. =Syria= On 12 March 2004 a fight between Arab and Kurdish supporters of rival Syrian football clubs at a match in Qamishli, north east of Damascus, escalated into full-scale riots that left 25 people dead and hundreds injured. Africa =Democratic Republic of the Congo= Four died when troops opened fire at a derby match between AS Vita Club and DC Motema Pembe at the Stade des Martyrs in Kinshasa in November 1998. In April 2001, 14 people died following a stampede at a derby match between TP Mazembe and FC Saint Eloi Lupopo. When fans invaded the pitch after Mazembe had equalised, and rival fans started throwing missiles at each other, the police fired tear gas, and fans rushed to escape the effects of the tear gas. In the resulting stampede, 14 people died. Fans of the two clubs are alleged to have a history of hatred and violence towards each other. =Egypt= In January 2006 riot police attacked Libyan fans in the Cairo International Stadium after they threw missiles at the Egyptian fans in the tier above them during a match between the Egypt national football team and the Morocco national team. The Libyan fans had stayed on to watch the match after they had seen Libya lose 2‚Äì1 to Ivory Coast and had started taunting the home supporters. The Egyptian fans responded by asking them to leave the stadium and verbally attacking them at half time, and when, despite a plea to stop, it continued into the second half, the riot police were called in. The Libyan Football Association were fined $7,000 by the disciplinary commission of the Confederation of African Football. A melee broke out on 1 February 2012, after fans of Al-Masry, the home team in Port Said, stormed the field following a rare 3‚Äì1 win against Al-Ahly, Egypt's top team. Al-Masry supporters attacked the Al-Ahly players and their fans with knives, swords, clubs, stones, bottles, and fireworks. At least 79 people were killed and over 1,000 were injured on both sides in the Mediterranean port city. On 26 January 2013 rioting broke out in Port Said in response to the announcement of death sentences for 21 individuals involved in the February 2012 disturbance. A mob of Al-Masry supporters attempted to storm the prison where the sentenced were held; in the subsequent rioting 30 people were killed, including two police officers, and some 300 were injured. =Equatorial Guinea= At the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, at the semi-finals between the host country Equatorial Guinea and Ghana, hooligans invaded the pitch and threw bottles and missiles at the Ghana players. =Gambia= Massive riots occurred during and after a Cup of African Nations qualifying game between rival neighbours Senegal and Gambia at the Leopold Sedar Senghor Stadium in Dakar, Senegal in June 2003. Gambian supporters hurled missiles towards Senegalese fans and were subsequently charged by soldiers. After the game, violent clashes were reported in both Gambia and Senegal. In Gambia several severe beatings of Senegalese citizens occurred, which led to over 200 Senegalese seeking shelter at their embassy. In Senegal a Gambian BBC reporter was attacked and robbed by a group of youths. The riots eventually led to the closing of the border between Gambia and Senegal until order was restored. =Ghana= Up to 125 people died and hundreds were injured when football fans stampeded at a match in Accra in 2001. Accra Hearts were leading 2‚Äì1 against Asante Kotoko with five minutes left in the match when some fans began throwing bottles and chairs onto the pitch. Police then fired tear gas into the crowd, sparking a panic. Fans rushed to escape the gas, and in the ensuing crush, up to 125 people were killed. Asante Kotoko faced a ban after fans assaulted the referee in a CAF Confederation Cup game against √âtoile Sportive du Sahel of Tunisia. =Ivory Coast= Fighting among fans at a match on 6 May 2001 led to one death and 39 injuries. =Kenya= In Kenya, the most hotly contested rivalry is the Nairobi derby between A.F.C. Leopards and Gor Mahia, both of whose fans are regularly associated with hooliganism. On 18 March 2012, a derby match was held up for over 26 minutes when a riot broke out, leading to destruction of property and several injuries, after Gor Mahia midfielder Ali Abondo was shown a red card for a dangerous tackle on Leopards' defender Amon Muchiri. Gor Mahia were banned by the Sports Stadia Management Board from playing in their facilities for the rest of the 2012 season, meaning that the club would not be able to play in either the Nyayo National Stadium or the Moi International Sports Centre. The KPL Board has yet to announce further disciplinary measures on the club. =Libya= Eight fans died and 39 were injured when troops opened fire to stop both pro- and anti- Muammar al-Gaddafi sentiments being expressed in a Tripoli stadium during a match between Al Ahli and Al Ittihad in December 1996. =Mali= After a World Cup qualifying match between Mali and Togo on 27 March 2005, which Togo won 2‚Äì1, Mali fans rioted and went on a spree of destruction and violence. The trouble started when Togo scored the winning goal. Police fired tear gas at Mali fans who had invaded the pitch. The match was abandoned and the win awarded to Togo. The result set off a wave of violence in the capital of Mali, Bamako. Thousands of Mali fans in Bamako began chanting threats toward the Mali players, cars were set on fire, stores looted, property and monuments destroyed and a building housing the local Olympics committee was burned down. =Mauritius= In May 1999, seven people died when rioting football fans threw petrol bombs into a casino, following a match in Port Louis between the Mauritian League champions, Scouts Club, and Fire Brigade SC. After the match which Fire Brigade SC won, hundreds of Scouts fans went on a rampage, attacking police vehicles and torching sugar cane fields. =Mozambique= The government of Mozambique had to apologise for the violent behaviour of Mozambique fans, before, during and after a match between Mozambican club Clube Ferrovi√°rio de Maputo and Zimbabwean club Dynamos on 10 May 1998. Ferrovi√°rio fans attacked the Dynamo players and the referee, stoned vehicles and fought running battles with riot police outside the stadium. Fifteen people, including four Red Cross workers, needed hospital treatment. =South Africa= In Johannesburg, South Africa, on 14 January 1991, forty people died when fans surged toward a jammed exit to escape rival brawling fans at a match southwest of Johannesburg. On 11 February 2017, a match between Mamelodi Sundowns F.C. and Orlando Pirates F.C. at Loftus Versfeld Stadium was suspended for nearly an hour when Pirates supporters invaded the pitch and clashed with Sundowns fans after Sundowns scored their sixth goal. =Zimbabwe= In July 2000 twelve people died following a stampede at a World Cup qualifying match between Zimbabwe and South Africa in Harare. Police fired tear gas when the crowd started throwing missiles onto the pitch, after South Africa had taken a two-goal lead. After Delron Buckley scored South Africa's second goal bottles began to fly onto the pitch. The police then fired tear gas into the 60,000-person crowd, who began running to the exits to escape the effects of the tear gas. The match had to be abandoned as players from both sides felt the effects of the tear gas and had to receive medical treatment. The police were condemned for firing tear gas. In July 2002, two fans were shot when police opened fire on rioting fans at a match in Bulawayo. Seven police officers were injured and five vehicles badly damaged. Oceania =Australia= Since the formation of the A-League in 2004, and the fall of the National Soccer League, football hooliganism has died off in competitions and incidents have become rare events. The incident with most notoriety in Australia is the Pratten Park riot in 1985 where hundreds of fans stormed the pitch midway through a Sydney Olympic v Sydney City match. In a match between Melbourne Heart and Melbourne Victory in February 2013, 17 plastic seats were destroyed and flares were firing off. In a match between Sydney FC and Melbourne Victory in November 2013, one travelling Melbourne Victory fan was hospitalised with a stab wound by a sixteen-year-old civilian. In December 2013, a riot between Melbourne Victory and Western Sydney Wanderers broke out at a pub before the match later that day. At an international football friendly between Australia and Serbia in Melbourne in June 2011, fans lit flares both inside and outside the stadium, and in city streets. Banners supporting Ratko Mladiƒá, the Serbian military leader charged with war crimes by the International Court of Justice, were displayed, and a laser pointer was seen in use. In February 2011, Victoria Police said they were reluctant to cover Melbourne Victory games because of unacceptable behaviour by fans. Problems included violence, anti-social behaviour and the lighting of flares. Although the A-League is relatively young, being only 12 years old, there are hooligan and casual groups within club's active supporter bases. Although it is nothing like football hooliganism in Europe, anti-social events do occasionally occur. A primary example would be the Bourke Street brawl between Melbourne Victory and Western Sydney Wanderers fans, who gathered in numbers before a match in late 2013 and had a brawl in Melbourne, causing concern among football authorities in Australia. There are small hooligan and casual groups in Australia, the most prominent being from the League's biggest fanbases, Melbourne Victory, Sydney FC and Western Sydney Wanderers though others exist within other supporter groups. Media portrayal Football hooliganism has been depicted in films such as ID, The Firm, Cass, The Football Factory, Green Street, Rise of the Footsoldier, Awaydays, The Brothers Grimsby and Eurotrip. There are also many books about hooliganism, such as The Football Factory and Among the Thugs. Some critics argue that these media representations glamorise violence and the hooligan lifestyle.

Queen Victoria appreciated his merits and appointed Hayter her Principal Painter in Ordinary and also awarded him a Knighthood 1841.  Early life  Self-portrait of George Hayter aged 28, painted in 1820 (National Portrait Gallery) Hayter was the son of Charles Hayter (1761‚Äì1835), a miniature painter and popular drawing-master and teacher of perspective who was appointed Professor of Perspective and Drawing to Princess Charlotte and published a well-known introduction to perspective and other works. Initially tutored by his father, he went to the Royal Academy Schools early in 1808, but in the same year, after a disagreement about his art studies, ran away to sea as a Midshipman in the Royal Navy. His father secured his release, and they came to an agreement that Hayter should assist him while pursuing his own studies.Barbara Coffey Bryant, \\"Hayter, Sir George (1792‚Äì1871)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 7 June 2007 In 1809 he secretly married Sarah Milton, a lodger at his father's house (he was 15 or 16, she 28), the arrangement remaining secret until around 1811. Together they had three children Georgiana, Leopold and Henry. At the Royal Academy Schools he studied under Fuseli, and in 1815 was appointed Painter of Miniatures and Portraits by Princess Charlotte. Hayter was awarded the British Institution‚Äôs premium for history painting for the Prophet Ezra (1815; Downton Castle), purchased by Richard Payne Knight. Around 1816 his wife left him, for reasons which are not apparent. He subsequently began a relationship with Louisa Cauty, daughter of Sir William Cauty, with whom he lived openly for the next decade and who bore him two children, Angelo and Louisa (despite not having sought a divorce from his first wife).  Travel to Italy  Encouraged by his patron, John Russell, 6th Duke of Bedford, he travelled to Italy to study in 1816. There he met Canova, whose studio he attended while painting his portrait, where he absorbed Canova's classical style. He is also believed to have learned sculpture from Canova at this time. Canova was Perpetual Principal of the Accademia di San Luca (Rome's premier artistic institution) and doubtless put Hayter forward for honorary membership on the strength of his painting ‚ÄòThe Tribute Money‚Äô which was very favourably received in Rome. Hayter thereby became the Academy's youngest ever member.  Historical portraiture  A Controversy on Colour, by John Hayter (1800‚Äì1891) showing from left to right Charles Hayter (father of John and George), John Hayter, Edwin Landseer and George Hayter (Shipley Art Gallery, UK) Returning to London in 1818, Hayter practised as a portrait painter in oils and history painter. Dubbed ‚ÄòThe Phoenix‚Äô by William Beckford, Hayter showed a pomposity that irritated his fellow artists, but he mixed freely with many aristocratic families. His unconventional domestic life (separated from his wife, yet living with his mistress) set him apart from official Academy circles: he was never elected to the Royal Academy. Venus, supported by Iris, complaining to Mars, by George Hayter. Exhibited RA in 1820 and winner of the Royal Academy Painting of the Year in 1823 (Chatsworth House, UK)Hayter was most productive and innovative during the 1820s. George Agar-Ellis (later Lord Dover) commissioned the Trial of Queen Caroline in the House of Lords in 1820 (exh. Cauty's Great Rooms, 80-82 Pall Mall, 1823; London, National Portrait Gallery); painted on a large scale (2.33√ó2.66 m), Hayter's first (and most successful) contemporary history painting revealed a taste for high drama effectively realised. In the Trial of William, Lord Russell, in the Old Bailey in 1683 (1825; Woburn Abbey) Hayter celebrated John Russell's ancestry, in a work reminiscent of fashionable tableaux vivants of the country-house set.  Return to the Continent  In 1826 Hayter settled in Italy. The Banditti of Kurdistan Assisting Georgians in Carrying off Circassian Women (untraced), completed in Florence for John Proby, 1st Earl of Carysfort (exhibited British Institution 1829), demonstrated Hayter's assimilation of the style and exotic subject-matter of contemporary French Romantic art. In 1827 his mistress, Louisa Cauty, died after poisoning herself with arsenic. Although it was apparently an accident, in a bid for attention, it was widely assumed that he had driven her to suicide, and he was forced by the scandal to move from Florence to Rome. By late 1828 he was in Paris, where his portraits of English society members (some exhibited at the Salon in 1831) were stylistically akin to the work of recent French portrait painters such as Fran√ßois G√©rard.  Royal patronage  The State Portrait of Queen Victoria (Royal Collection)In 1831 Hayter returned to England. His grandiose plan to paint the first sitting after the passage of the Reform Bill resulted in his painting Moving the Address to the Crown on the Opening of the First Reformed Parliament in the Old House of Commons, 5 February 1833 (1833‚Äì1843; London, N.P.G.), for which he executed nearly 400 portrait studies in oil. Hayter was an ardent supporter of the reform movement and this painting was not commissioned but to all intents and purposes a labour of love. It occupied him for ten years with no guarantee of financial reward. This is one of the last images executed of the interior of the old House of Commons before its destruction in the fire of 1834. The painting was finally purchased by the government for the nation in 1854, 20 years after it was started. Having painted the young Princess Victoria (1832‚Äì3; destr.; oil sketch, Brit. Royal Col.), Hayter was not a surprising choice as the new Queen's 'Portrait and Historical Painter'. But on the death of Sir David Wilkie in 1841 Hayter's appointment as Principal Painter in Ordinary to the Queen caused some annoyance at the Royal Academy as this appointment had historically been the preserve of the President, then Sir Martin Archer Shee. In 1842 Hayter was knighted. He painted several royal ceremonies including Queen Victoria's coronation of 1838 and marriage of 1840 and also the Christening of the Prince of Wales of 1843 (all Brit. Royal Col.). He also painted several royal portraits including his most well-known work the State Portrait of the new Queen Victoria. Several versions of this portrait were done, with the assistance of the artist's son Angelo, to be sent as diplomatic gifts. Hayter's active period at court was short-lived, however, because Albert preferred German painters such as F. X. Winterhalter. Several significant examples of Hayter's works from this period remain a part of the Royal Collection, and both the State Portrait and Wedding painting are among those displayed to the public at Buckingham Palace. There is also a full-scale version of the State Portrait in the National Portrait Gallery and smaller copy at Holyrood House.  Later years  Self Portrait of Sir George Hayter in 1863, (Private Coll.) By the mid-1840s Hayter's portrait style was considered old-fashioned. He adjusted his type of history painting to suit the more literal taste of the early Victorian era (e.g. Wellington Viewing Napoleon's Effigy at Madame Tussaud's; destr. 1925; engraving, 1854). (V&A;) Hayter also painted several large religious paintings including two depicting important Reformist events, 'Bishop Latimer Preaching at Paul's Cross' and 'The Martyrdom of Bishops Ridley and Latimer' (exh. 1855), both of which were given to the Art Museum, Princeton University, USA in 1984. He painted several biblical scenes from the Old and New Testament, among them The Angels Ministering to Christ in 1849 (V&A;) and Joseph Interpreting the Baker's Dream in 1854 (Lancaster City Museums). He also produced fluent landscape watercolours (many of Italian views), etchings (he published a volume in 1833), decorative designs and sculpture. The contents of Hayter's studio were auctioned at Christie's, London, on 19 April 1871. His younger brother, John (1800‚Äì1895), was also an artist, known chiefly as a portrait draughtsman in chalks and crayons and his younger sister Anne worked as a miniaturist. Some sources say that the influential printmaker Stanley William Hayter was a direct descendant from John Hayter,*Innovation in printmaking: Obituary of Mr S W Hayter, The Times, London, May 7, 1988 although others say the ancestor was Sir George Hayter himself. However the family tree of John and George Hayter published in Crisps Visitations shows no possible link to SW Hayter.Visitation of England and Wales, Volume 17 1911, ed. Frederick Arthur Crisp, reprinted 1997 by Heritage Books Inc. What is known for certain is that the French painter and writer, Jean Ren√© Bazaine was a great great grandson of George Hayter, through his eldest daughter Georgiana Elizabeth, who married Pierre-Dominique Bazaine older brother of Marshal Bazaine.Jean Bazaine: Couleurs et Mots: le cherche midi √©diteur, 1997 (entretiens avec Paul Ric≈ìur et Henri Maldiney)  See also  * List of British painters * Henry Collen  References   Further reading  * R.

The pupae lack cocoons. Some species retain a functional sting. The petioles of Myrmicinae consist of two nodes. The nests are permanent and in soil, rotting wood, under stones, or in trees.Goulet, H & Huber, JT (eds.) (1993) Hymenoptera of the world: an identification guide to families. Agriculture Canada. p. 224  Identification  Myrmicine worker ants have a distinct postpetiole, i.e., abdominal segment III is notably smaller than segment IV and set off from it by a well-developed constriction; the pronotum is inflexibly fused to the rest of the mesosoma, such that the promesonotal suture is weakly impressed or absent, and a functional sting is usually present. The clypeus is well-developed; as a result, the antennal sockets are well separated from the anterior margin of the head. Most myrmicine genera possess well-developed eyes and frontal lobes that partly conceal the antennal insertions.  Tribes  Recently, the number of tribes was reduced from 25 to six: *Attini Smith, 1858 *Crematogastrini Forel, 1893 *Myrmicini Lepeletier de Saint-Fargeau, 1835 *Pogonomyrmecini Ward, Brady, Fisher & Schultz, 2015 *Solenopsidini Forel, 1893 *Stenammini Ashmead, 1905  Genera  In 2014, a majority of genera were placed into different tribes or moved to other subfamilies.

The elder son of a wealthy Budapest Jewish family (his father was head of public transport, his mother the daughter of a professor), Balogh studied at the city Gymnasium, considered 'the Eton of Hungarian youth', then at the universities of Budapest and Berlin. He took a two-year research position at Harvard University as a Rockefeller Fellow in 1928. Following this, Balogh worked in banking in Paris, Berlin and Washington before coming to England.A Biographical Dictionary of Dissenting Economists, ed. Philip Arestis, Malcolm C. Sawyer, pg 28-35, Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd, 2000 After getting British citizenship in 1938, he became a lecturer at Balliol College, Oxford, and was elected to a Fellowship in 1945, then became Reader in 1960. He was also the economic correspondent for the New Statesman, an economic adviser to Harold Wilson's Cabinet office following the 1964 Labour Party victory,Brief Lives, Paul Johnson, pp 22-24, Arrow Books, 2011 and member of the Secretariat of the League of Nations. As an advisor in the Cabinet Office after 1964, Balogh was a critic of consumption- and profit-orientated tax policies, arguing that \\"profit can be earned not merely by satisfying long felt wants more efficiently and in a better fashion, but also by creating new wants through artificially engendered satisfaction and the suggestion of status symbols\\", instead arguing that nationalisation was a better means of securing wage restraint and a more equitable tax system as a whole. Balogh was opposed to Britain's entry of the EEC.

He was a prominent single-tax activist following the political-economic reformer Henry George. He was the great-great-grandson of the famous potter Josiah Wedgwood. Biography Josiah Wedgwood was born at Barlaston in Staffordshire, the son of Clement Wedgwood. He was the great-great-grandson of the potter Josiah Wedgwood. His mother Emily Catherine was the daughter of the engineer James Meadows Rendel. He was educated at Clifton College and then studied at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. He married his first cousin Ethel Kate Bowen (1869‚Äì1952), daughter of Sir Charles Bowen, 1st Baron Bowen in 1894 but she left him in 1913 and divorced him in 1919. Since divorce at that time required a guilty party, he agreed to take the blame and was found guilty of adultery and desertion of his wife and children. This led to criticism from the press and pulpit. More criticism was levelled after the divorce was final and he revealed that the desertion was a formality and the adultery staged. They had seven children: *Helen Bowen Wedgwood (1895‚Äì1981), married the geneticist Michael Pease, son of Edward Reynolds Pease. One of their sons was the physicist Bas Pease and one of their daughters, Jocelyn Richenda Gammell Pease (1925‚Äì2003), married Andrew Huxley, the biologist. *Rosamund Wedgwood (1896‚Äì1960) *Francis Charles Bowen Wedgwood (1898‚Äì1959), 2nd Baron Wedgwood. He was father of the 3rd Baron. *Josiah Wedgwood V (1899‚Äì1968), managing director of Wedgwood. He was father of Dr John Wedgwood (1919‚Äì2007), former heir presumptive to the barony. *Camilla Hildegarde Wedgwood (1901‚Äì1955), anthropologist *Elizabeth Julia Wedgwood (1907‚Äì1993) *Gloria Wedgwood (1909‚Äì1974) In 1919 he remarried; his second wife was Florence Ethel Willett (1878‚Äì1969). Military and political career Wedgwood photographed by John Benjamin Stone in 1911 Proficient in mathematics, he joined the workshops of an arms manufacturer, Elswick. In 1891, he was commissioned in the 1st Northumberland (Western Division, Royal Artillery). He worked for a year from 1895 as an Assistant Naval Constructor in Portsmouth before returning to Newcastle upon Tyne to head the drawing office of another arms manufacturer, Armstrong. Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in late 1899 he was given the army rank of captain on 3 March 1900, and for three years commanded a volunteer battery of the Royal Field Artillery equipped by Elswick. He remained in South Africa after the war, spending two years as a Resident Magistrate in the district of Ermelo in the Transvaal. His studies of native land laws gave him an interest in Land Reform. Influenced by the writings of Henry George, he developed a lifelong belief in the Single Tax, advocating a tax on property to replace taxes on income and goods as a way of securing for workers the full reward for their work. He became president of the League for the Taxation of Land Values in 1908. Having returned to England, Wedgwood was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Newcastle-under-Lyme at the 1906 general election. Though he stood for the Liberal Party, he made it clear that he would take an independent line in Parliament if necessary, in accordance with his conscience. He was re-elected at both the January and December 1910 elections, and that year was also elected to Staffordshire County Council, remaining a councillor until 1918. He became disillusioned with the Liberals after 1910, when it became clear that the government would not honour campaign commitments to land reform and opposing vested interests. His disillusionment was increased by the government's reaction against the Suffragettes, whom he also supported. In 1913 he staged a filibuster against the government's Mental Deficiency Bill, which he saw as authoritarian and unjust. Over the course of two days in Parliament, he tabled 120 amendments and made 150 speeches in Parliament, sustaining himself with only barley-water and chocolate according to press reports, until his voice gave out. This campaign brought him to public attention outside of his own constituency and the Land Reform movement, and he became known as a leading backbencher. =World War I= Following the outbreak of the First World War, he volunteered for service with the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, holding the rank of lieutenant-commander. He returned to mechanical work and was posted to the Armoured Car Section of the Royal Naval Air Service. He served in Belgium and France in 1914 with the armoured cars. He was wounded in the Dardanelles Campaign in 1915, receiving the Distinguished Service Order for his service during the landing at Cape Helles, commanding the machine guns on SS River Clyde. It was while serving at Gallipoli that he met volunteers of the Zion Mule Corps commanded by Joseph Trumpeldor that would affect his views about British policy on Palestine.Greenfield, Murray S. & Hochstein, Joseph M., Jews' Secret Fleet, Gefen Publishing House, Jerusalem, 2010, p.56 Back in Parliament he expressed concern at under-staffing and support for national service, though he also defended the rights of conscientious objectors. Later that year he was posted as an army captain to the staff of General Jan Smuts in East Africa. In 1916 he was part of the Mesopotamia Commission of Inquiry. Promoted to Major he commanded a machine gun company in the 2nd South African Infantry Brigade in 1916. In 1917 he became Assistant Director of Trench Warfare with the rank of colonel. At the start of 1918 he was sent to Siberia where his mission was to encourage continued Russian participation in the war and to gathering intelligence on Bolshevik control in Siberia. =1918 General Election= In the 1918 General Election he sought re-election. There has been some confusion regarding his specific affiliation at the time of the election. He was officially supported by his local Liberal Association and he was officially endorsed by the Coalition Government. This led to him being described in many sources at the time as a Coalition Liberal. However, during the election campaign he publicly distanced himself from the Coalition Government. His own local election campaign was minimal because he was not opposed. In his election address he stated \\"I come before you, the same impenitent independent radical that you first elected in 1906\\".The Last of the Radicals by CV Wedgwood This had led some to incorrectly describe him in 1918 as an 'Independent Radical' even though in 1906 he was classified as a 'Liberal'. The usually reliable F. W. S. Craig, in his book British Parliamentary Election results, 1918-1949 described him as an 'Independent Liberal'. However his status as an official Liberal rather than an Independent Liberal was subsequently confirmed when he attended the first meeting of the Liberal parliamentary party on 3 February 1919.The Downfall of the Liberal Party by Trevor Wilson =Joining Labour= In 1919, Wedgwood took the Labour whip in the House of Commons and joined the Independent Labour Party. He enjoyed the freer atmosphere of Labour and the party warmly welcomed him, electing him joint Vice-Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party in 1921. Wedgwood maintained his reputation for championing new ideas and the interests of outsiders and underdogs. He supported a number of unpopular causes, including opposition to the reparations from Germany contained in the Treaty of Versailles. In 1920 he criticised the government's partition of British territories into Palestine and Transjordan, and continued to attack what he saw as its bias against Zionism for the next two decades. That year he also led a commission from the Labour Party and the TUC to Hungary, which reported on the extremely brutal treatment of suspected communists under the new authoritarian regime. He supported refugee causes in Britain, particularly that of anarchists from the Soviet Union, such as Emma Goldman. Most of all he became known for his support of the Indian independence movement. =Cabinet and the Lords= Josiah Wedgwood There was tacit co-operation between Labour and the opposition Liberals in some seats at the 1923 general election, and Wedgwood ran unopposed in Newcastle-under-Lyme. Having been re-elected Vice- Chairman of the party in 1922 and 1923, Wedgwood expected a seat in the Cabinet when Labour formed its first government at the start of 1924. There was speculation in the press that he would be made First Lord of the Admiralty and some expectation that he would become Secretary of State for the Colonies or for India. Sidney Webb believed Wedgwood would prefer to become President of the Board of Trade, and was willing to step aside in his favour. However, Ramsay MacDonald initially offered him only the junior position of Financial Secretary to the Treasury. After some pressing, MacDonald gave him a seat in the Cabinet, but with the sinecure title of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster rather than a departmental portfolio. In this capacity, he performed various de facto tasks in government. Later in the year, he was appointed Chief Industrial Commissioner, succeeding Arthur Henderson in a difficult position as the government's decision to maintain some of its predecessor's policies on industrial action caused much friction within the Labour movement. He was sworn into the Privy Council in 1924. He chaired a Cabinet Committee to contemplate the use of the Emergency Powers Act against strikes in the transport industry. He took a strong line on a number of issues, opposing disarmament and the promise of a loan to the Soviet Union. He was also wary of the state undertaking public works purely for the sake of doing so, without any utilitarian benefit. After the fall of the government, Wedgwood publicly criticised MacDonald's leadership and Labour's reliance on civil servants. He sat on Labour's front bench in opposition, speaking on, amongst other policy areas, local government, where he encouraged Clement Attlee. He was not offered a position in the second Labour government. In March 1929, he became chairman of the House of Commons Records Committee. He began compiling a history of the Commons, a subject that consumed his interest. He wrote a history of Staffordshire's parliamentary representatives from the thirteenth century to the First World War, and two volumes of biographies of MPs of the 15th century. Wedgwood's work in this area led eventually to the establishment of the History of Parliament Trust. Throughout the 1930s, he continued to speak in the Commons on issues of importance to him, particularly the Single Tax and native resistance to colonialism. In 1930 and 1931 he was made Mayor of Newcastle-under-Lyme after successfully campaigning for the town to remain independent of Stoke-on-Trent. From the mid-1930s he was critical of appeasement and of limitations on the migration of Jews to Palestine (1939 White Paper) and of German refugees to Britain and worked tirelessly to help European Jews. The actor Heinz Bernard's life was saved as a result of a parliamentary questionREFUGEES. (Hansard, 6 July 1939) asked by Wedgwood which resulted in his being given a visa to Britain. In the Second World War, he joined the Home Guard in 1940. In 1941 he toured the United States of America, putting Britain's case against Germany at public meetings. Whilst Wedgwood was in America, Winston Churchill offered him a peerage, inviting him to sit for Labour in the House of Lords. Wedgwood accepted, resigning as MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme after 36 years and becoming Baron Wedgwood, of Barlaston in the County of Stafford on 21 January 1942. The following year he died in London at age of 71. Zionism Wedgwood was impressed by his contact with the Zion Mule Corps in 1915, while serving in World War I, but said that he first became aware of Zionism \\"as a creed\\" in 1916 when Dorothy Richardson invited him to address a Zionist meeting.

In October 1926, Wedgwood, a devoted Zionist, visited Palestine and challenged the Mandatory government's policies in his 1928 book The Seventh Dominion, accusing the British administration of hindering the country's social and economic development.Josaih Wedgwood and the seventh dominion scheme, Joshua b. Stein In 1942 he prefaced the booklet STOP THEM NOW, the first public report printed in English about the non-stop destruction of the Jews in German-occupied territories, in which he says : \\"The Huns and the Mongols, Tamerlane with his mountains of skulls, all these demons of long ago were patterns of chivalry compared with the pureblooded devils into which Hitler has converted Germans.\\"STOP THEM NOW - German mass-murder of Jews in Poland, p. 3.

In 2003, Cauterize's first single Something Beautiful was released, with its only music video, was broadcast on the web site muchloud.com. Its second and third singles Choke and Killing Me were used in Nintendo's 1080 Avalanche video game and commercials, with a hidden live video within the game. Also in 2003, Cauterize recorded its 3rd CD, So Far From Real, produced by Murray Daigle. The band toured with Evanescence, Three Days Grace, and Hoobastank. It ceased touring, but in 2005 produced an independently released second album, Paper Wings, the band having left Wind-up Records. The same year, the band's personnel was augmented with guitarist Chuck Coles (previously of Murder Culture). Coles subsequently played in heavy metal band Brown Brigade, (with Sum 41 guitarist Dave Baksh), and has started a southern rock collaboration with Cauterize drummer Matt Worobec. In 2006 Darrin Pfeiffer, Cauterize's new manager, founded record label, High 4 Records, to promote Canadian Talent; Cauterize was one of his first acts. The band re-recorded a number of tracks from Paper Wings, and new material, with Greig Nori (from the bands Treble Charger and Sum 41) ; the new album, re-released in 2007 as Disguises, with songs Closer and Minor Key Symphony as single releases, was unsuccessful in securing radio play and sales. In 2007 a scheduled September 5 performance on MTV Live in Canada was canceled and on September 12, at a concert in Ottawa, Cauterize announced that they were breaking up after twelve years together.

Her father served in the Hungarian army until he was captured and brought to the Soviet Union and later back to Hungary, where he settled in Budapest. Bala»ô tried to reunite the family and move to Hungary, but although she managed to obtain a Hungarian passport in 1947, she was not allowed to leave Romania. When asked in an interview in 2005 whether she had ever thought about defection, she said that it had crossed her mind; however, as it could have resulted in serious retaliation against her relatives, she did not want to risk it. In the interview she said, \\"I feel sorry that I did not win Olympics for Hungary. But a person represents herself and after that a nation. It was not given for me to bear the Hungarian colors, to make happy those who speak my mother tongue.

In 1953 she transferred from Timi»ôoara club \\"Electrica\\" to CCA (CSA Steaua). After finishing fifth in the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, she won Olympic gold medals at Rome in 1960 (becoming the first Romanian woman to do so) and Tokyo in 1964. At the 1964 Olympics she competed with a torn tendon, which forced her later to withdraw from the 1966 European Championships. Nevertheless, between 1957 and 1966, Bala»ô won 154 consecutive competitions,\\"The Sport's Longest Winning Streak Gets Longer\\", Track & Field News (August 2016), p. 47. not including qualifying competitions or exhibitions. She improved the world record 14 times, from 1.75 m to 1.91 m, and equalled it once outdoors and once indoors. She was the first woman to jump over six feet. Her technique was a sophisticated version of the scissors technique. Her record of 1.91 m, set in 1961, lasted until the end of 1971 (beaten by Ilona Gusenbauer from Austria), when jumpers with a more efficient technique (the straddle technique, and later the Fosbury style) took over.

Its remains are today in the comune of Massa d'Albe. History It was originally a town of the Aequi, though on the frontier of the Marsi, but was occupied by a Roman colony (304 BC) owing to its strategic importance.Liv. 10.1.1.2 http://latin.packhum.org/loc/914/1/0#484 It lay on a hill just to the north of the Via Valeria, which was probably prolonged beyond Tibur at this very period. In the Second Punic War Alba at first remained faithful, but afterwards refused to send contingents and was punished. Endnote: A very good description of the site, with plans, is given by C. Promis, L'Antichit√† di Alba Fucense (Rome, 1836). After this it became a regular place of detention for important state prisoners, such as Syphax of Numidia, Perseus of Macedonia, Bituitus, king of the Arverni. It was attacked by the allies in the Social War, but remained faithful to Rome; and its strong position rendered it a place of some importance in the civil wars. Its prosperity, in the imperial period, can only be inferred from the number of inscriptions found there. The town was completely destroyed by the Saracens in the 10th century. Buildings It is chiefly remarkable for its finely preserved fortifications. The external walls, which have a circuit of about 3 km, are constructed of polygonal masonry; the blocks are carefully jointed, and the faces smoothed. With our present knowledge of such constructions their date cannot certainly be determined. They are not preserved to any very considerable height; but the arrangement of the gates is clearly traceable; as a rule they come at the end of a long, straight stretch of wall, and are placed so as to leave the right side of any attacking force exposed. On the north there is, for a length of about 150 m, a triple line of defences of later date (possibly added by the Roman colonists), inasmuch as both the city wall proper, and the double wall thrown out in front of it are partly constructed of concrete, and faced with finer polygonal masonry (in which horizontal joints seem to be purposely avoided). View of the forum of Alba Fucens Amphitheatre of Alba Fucens A mile to the north of the city a huge mound with a ditch on each side of it (but at a considerable distance from it) may be traced; for a couple of miles. Within the walls there are hardly any buildings of a later date. Excavations have only been made casually, though remains of buildings and of roads can be traced, and also an extensive system of underground passages perhaps connected with the defences of the place. The hill at the western extremity was occupied by a temple of the Tuscan order, into which was built the church of S. Pietro; this contains ancient columns, and some remarkably fine specimens of Cosmatesque work. It is the only monastic church in the Abruzzi in which the nave is separated from the aisles by ancient columns. The collegiate church of S. Nicola, in the village, contains a remarkable staurotheca of the 11th (?) century, and a wooden triptych in imitation of the Byzantine style with enamels, of the 13th century. Excavations In the 20th century the Belgian academy at Rome carried out excavations at the site, under the direction of Joseph Mertens. This project led to a series of publications of the site and its remains. Bibliography *J. Mertens. 1969. Alba Fucens 2 Rapports et √©tudes. Bruxelles: Rome Institut Historique Belge.

Given a complex manifold M, a differential of the first kind œâ is therefore the same thing as a 1-form that is everywhere holomorphic; on an algebraic variety V that is non-singular it would be a global section of the coherent sheaf Œ©1 of K√§hler differentials. In either case the definition has its origins in the theory of abelian integrals. The dimension of the space of differentials of the first kind, by means of this identification, is the Hodge number :h1,0. The differentials of the first kind, when integrated along paths, give rise to integrals that generalise the elliptic integrals to all curves over the complex numbers. They include for example the hyperelliptic integrals of type : \\\\int\\\\frac{x^k \\\\, dx}{\\\\sqrt{Q(x)}} where Q is a square- free polynomial of any given degree > 4\\\\. The allowable power k has to be determined by analysis of the possible pole at the point at infinity on the corresponding hyperelliptic curve. When this is done, one finds that the condition is :k ‚â§ g ‚àí 1, or in other words, k at most 1 for degree of Q 5 or 6, at most 2 for degree 7 or 8, and so on (as g = [(1+ deg Q)/2]). Quite generally, as this example illustrates, for a compact Riemann surface or algebraic curve, the Hodge number is the genus g. For the case of algebraic surfaces, this is the quantity known classically as the irregularity q. It is also, in general, the dimension of the Albanese variety, which takes the place of the Jacobian variety. Differentials of the second and third kind The traditional terminology also included differentials of the second kind and of the third kind. The idea behind this has been supported by modern theories of algebraic differential forms, both from the side of more Hodge theory, and through the use of morphisms to commutative algebraic groups. The Weierstrass zeta function was called an integral of the second kind in elliptic function theory; it is a logarithmic derivative of a theta function, and therefore has simple poles, with integer residues. The decomposition of a (meromorphic) elliptic function into pieces of 'three kinds' parallels the representation as (i) a constant, plus (ii) a linear combination of translates of the Weierstrass zeta function, plus (iii) a function with arbitrary poles but no residues at them. The same type of decomposition exists in general, mutatis mutandis, though the terminology is not completely consistent. In the algebraic group (generalized Jacobian) theory the three kinds are abelian varieties, algebraic tori, and affine spaces, and the decomposition is in terms of a composition series. On the other hand, a meromorphic abelian differential of the second kind has traditionally been one with residues at all poles being zero. One of the third kind is one where all poles are simple. There is a higher-dimensional analogue available, using the Poincar√© residue.

Description Monte Massico is an Italian mountain ridge. In antiquity, it was described as being in the territory of the Aurunci, and on the border of Campania and Latium adjectum attributed by most authors to the latter. It projects south-west from the volcanic system of Rocca Monfina (see Suessa Aurunca) as far as the sea, and separates the lower course of the Liris from the plain of Campania. It consists of limestone, with a superstratum of pliocenic and volcanic masses, and was once an island; its highest point is 811 meters (2661 feet) above sea-level. It was famous for its wine in ancient times. There was just room along the coast for the road to pass through; the pass was guarded by the Auruncan town of Vescia (probably on the mountain side), which ceased to exist in 314 BC after the defeat of the Ausones, but left its name to the spot. Its successor, Sinuessa, on the coast, a station on the Via Appia, was constructed in 312 BC, and a colony was founded there in 295 BC. It was mentioned by classical writers as a place in which travellers halted. Here Virgil joined Horace on the famous journey to Brundisium. Domitian considerably increased its importance by the construction of the Via Domitiana, which left the Via Appia here and ran to Cumae and Puteoli, and it was he, no doubt, who raised it to the position of colonia Flavia. The town was destroyed by the Saracens, but some ruins of it are still visible two miles north-west of the modern village of Mondragone - the mineral springs which still rise here were frequented in antiquity. \\\\---- Category:Mountains of Campania Category:Province of Caserta Category:Mountain ranges of Italy ","title":"Monte Massico"},{"id":"1138932","text":"Kyran Paul Patrick Bracken MBE (born 22 November 1971) is a world-cup winning former rugby union footballer who played at scrum-half for Saracens, Bristol and Waterloo. He won a total of 51 England caps and captained the team on three occasions, retiring from international rugby in 2004. Early life Bracken was born in Dublin, Ireland. His father was a dentist and his mother had played hockey for Ireland. They originally lived in Balbriggan but moved to England when Bracken was four. He was brought up in Liverpool and was educated at St. Edward's College, and later at Stonyhurst College in Lancashire, where he was coached by former England Rugby Union Head Coach, Brian Ashton. He attended a trial for Liverpool FC and scored three goals. He also flirted with the idea of playing rugby league for St. Helens. After school he read Law at the University of Bristol whom he represented at rugby union and later qualified as a solicitor. He was turned down by Ireland as 'not good enough' but signed up by Bristol. Rugby career Bracken made his England debut in November 1993 against the All Blacks. However, a stamp from Jamie Joseph seriously injured his ankle, putting him out of action for three months and leaving him with a permanent weakness. He started the 1994 Five Nations, but was dropped halfway through in favour of Dewi Morris. He missed the summer tour to South Africa, studying for law exams, but played in the 1995 Five Nations. Injury kept him out of the 1995 World Cup. Bracken joined Saracens in 1996 and was part of the team that won the Tetley's Bitter Cup against Wasps in 1998. He missed out on selection for the 1997 British and Irish Lions tour to South Africa in favour of Matt Dawson and Austin Healey, but was called up as injury replacement for Rob Howley but did not play in the tests. He then became an irregular scrum half for England, with Dawson generally having the upper hand but being frequently injured. Bracken himself had a serious back injury that kept him out for most of the 1999-2000 season, including the 1999 World Cup. He missed out on selection for 2001 Lions tour to Australia, instead captaining England on a three match development tour of North America. By then he was mostly having to compete with Matt Dawson as first-choice \\"number 9\\". In 2003 he played in the summer tour beating Australia and New Zealand. He appeared four times for England during the 2003 World Cup, mostly as a substitute or blood replacement, becoming a world-cup winner as England lifted the trophy. He won his 50th cap against Wales in the quarter-final, and gained his last cap in the semi-final against France. Bracken was also the player who drew groans from the cast of Friends after being tackled in the episode \\"The One with All the Rugby\\". Dancing on Ice Bracken starred in and won ITV's celebrity ice dancing competition Dancing on Ice in 2007, with partner Melanie Lambert. In the semi-final he received the highest score in the history of Dancing on Ice at that time (29.5 out of a possible 30) matched only by rival Clare Buckfield the next week. He was then was voted into the final alongside actress Clare Buckfield and former Blue member Duncan James. He won the final on 17 March 2007 after a performance which included the required element of \\"flying\\" on wires and a final performance of Bolero. On 24 March 2007 he won the special edition of Dancing on Ice 'The Champion of Champions', after repeating his record 29.5-point score. He toured with Holiday on Ice in their show \\"Romanza\\". Bracken made an appearance during preparations for Dancing on Ice 2008, week 5, to help contestant and friend Steve Backley with his performance. After finishing the tour with Holiday on Ice Bracken has confirmed he was appearing in the Dancing on Ice Live tour 2008. He also created his own Ice Party, held at the Hand Stadium, home of Clevedon Town, which starred himself, Clare Buckfield, Suzanne Shaw and many world-famous skaters. Bracken placed 5th in the 2014 'all stars' series of Dancing on Ice being eliminated in the Quarter-Finals. He was partnered with professional ice skater Nina Ulanova. Media career In 2020, Kyran launched a new podcast called Ruck It! with fellow England international Nick Easter. Personal life Bracken and his wife, Victoria, have three sons, Charlie, Jack and Lochlan, and they live in Hadley Wood. Charitable work Bracken is an Honorary President of the rugby charity Wooden Spoon improving the lives of disadvantaged children and young people in Britain and Ireland. He is also an Ambassador of the Royal National Children's Foundation (formerly the Joint Educational trust) which helps support vulnerable, disadvantaged young people at state and independent boarding schools throughout the UK. In 2009 he presented awards for Amersham & Wycombe College in their first awards ceremony.

Sesostris () was the name of a king of ancient Egypt who, according to Herodotus, led a military expedition into parts of Europe.  Account of Herodotus  In Herodotus' Histories there appears a story told by Egyptian priests about a Pharaoh Sesostris, who once led an army northward overland to Asia Minor, then fought his way westward until he crossed into Europe, where he defeated the Scythians and Thracians (possibly in modern Romania and Bulgaria). Sesostris then returned home, leaving colonists behind at the river Phasis in Colchis. Herodotus cautioned the reader that much of this story came second hand via Egyptian priests, but also noted that the Colchians were commonly known to be Egyptian colonists.\\"For it is plain to see that the Colchians are Egyptians; and what I say, I myself noted before I heard it from others.\\" Herodotus Histories 2.104 According to Diodorus Siculus (who calls him Sesoosis) and Strabo, he conquered the whole world, even Scythia and Ethiopia, divided Egypt into administrative districts or nomes, was a great law-giver, and introduced a caste system into Egypt and the worship of Serapis. Herodotus also relates that when Sesostris defeated an army without much resistance he erected a pillar in their capital with a vulva on it to symbolize the fact that the army fought like women.Herodotus Histories 2.102 Pliny the Elder also makes mention of Sesostris, who, he claims, was defeated by Saulaces, a gold-rich king of Colchis. Herodotus describes Sesostris as the father of the blind king Pheron, who was less warlike than his father. Modern research In Manetho's Aegyptiaca (History of Egypt), a pharaoh called \\"Sesostris\\" occupied the same position as the known pharaoh Senusret III of the Twelfth Dynasty, and his name is now usually viewed as a corruption of Senusret/Senwosret/Senwosri. In fact, he is commonly believed to be based on Senusret III, with the possible addition of memories of other namesake pharaohs of the same dynasty, as well as Seti I and Ramesses II of the much later Nineteenth Dynasty.Silverman, David P., Ancient Egypt, Oxford University Press (5 Jun 2003), , p. 29 \\"So far as is known no Egyptian king penetrated a day's journey beyond the Euphrates or into Asia Minor, or touched the continent of Europe\\". The images of Sesostris carved in stone in Ionia which Herodotus said he had seen\\"Most of the memorial pillars which King Sesostris erected in conquered countries have disappeared, but I have seen some myself in Palestine with the inscription I mentioned and the drawing of a woman's genitals. In Ionia also there are two images of Sesostris cut on rock, one on the road from Ephesos to Phocaea, the other between Sardis and Smyrna; in each case the carved figure is nearly seven feet high and represents a man with a spear in his right hand and a bow in his left, and the rest of his equipment to match ‚Äì partly Egyptian, partly Ethiopian.\\" Herodotus II.106 are likely to be identified with the Luwian inscriptions of Karabel Pass, the Karabel relief, now known to have been carved by Tarkasnawa, king of the Arzawan rump state of Mira.http://www.hittitemonuments.com/karabel/ The kings of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth dynasties were the greatest conquerors that Egypt ever produced, and their records are clear on the limits of Egyptian expansion. Senusret III raided into the Levant as far as Shechem, also into Ethiopia, and at Semna above the second cataract set up a stela of conquest that in its expressions recalls the stelae of Sesostris in Herodotus: Sesostris may, therefore, be the highly magnified portrait of this Pharaoh.

Culture  Trade beads found at a Wichita village site, ca. 1740, collection of the Oklahoma History Center The Wichita language is one of the Caddoan languages. They are related by language and culture to the Pawnee, with whom they enjoy close relations. The Wichita lived in fixed villages notable for their large, domed-shaped, grass-covered dwellings, sometimes up to 30 feet in diameter. The Wichita were successful hunters and farmers and skilled traders and negotiators. Their historical homelands stretched from San Antonio, Texas in the south to as far north as Great Bend, Kansas. A semi-sedentary people, they occupied northern Texas in the early 18th century. They traded with other Southern Plains Indians on both sides of the Red River and as far south as Waco. The Wichita made much of their own art, notably making their own ceramic pottery that greatly fascinated French and Spanish traders.Long unreported artifact collections from spanish fort bend wichita indian sites in oklahoma and texas. Plains Anthropologist, 57(221), 63-69. Wichita pottery is \\"virtually indistinguishable from the Osage and Pawnee\\", two other closely related Indigenous groups.Stephen M. Perkins & Timothy G. Baugh (2008) Protohistory and the Wichita, Plains Anthropologist, 53:208, 381-394, Historically, for much of the year, the Wichita lived in huts made of forked cedar poles covered by dry grasses. In the winter, they followed American bison (buffalo) in a seasonal hunt and lived in hunting camps. Wichita people relied heavily on bison, using all parts‚Äîfor clothing, food and cooking fat, winter shelter, leather supplies, sinew, medicine, and even armor. Each spring, Wichita families settled in their villages for another season of cultivating crops. Eventually, horses played a large role in the Wichita people's lifestyle. Increased access to horses in the mid 17th century caused Wichita hunting styles and seasons to become longer and more community-oriented. The Wichita economy also focused on horticulture, root-gathering, and fruits and nuts. Wichita people wore clothing from tanned hides, which the women prepared and sewed. They often decorated their dresses with elk canine teeth. Both men and women tattooed their faces and bodies with solid and dotted lines and circles. Wichita people had a history of intermarriage and alliance with other groups. Notably, the women of the Wichita worked with the Pueblo to harvest crops and engage in trade. Pueblo women were recorded to have intermarried with Wichita people and lived together in Wichita villages. In terms of social structure, the Wichita were organized by ranking of each tribe. Tribes were also led by two chiefs. = Name = The Wichita tribes call themselves Kitikiti'sh / Kirikirish (\\"raccoon-eyed people\\"), because of the historical practice of tattooing marks around their eyes. The kindred Pawnee called them K√≠rikuuruks / K√≠rikuruks (\\"bear-eyed people\\") and the Arikara referred to them as ƒåiriku√∫nux (a reference to the Wichita practice of tattoos). The Kiowa knew them as Thoe-Khoot (\\"tattoo faces\\"). = Bands = Wichita people have been a loose confederation of related peoples on the Southern Plains, including such bands or sub-tribes as Taovayas (Tawehash), Tawakonis, Wacos (who appear to have been the Yscani/Iscanis of earlier times), and Guichitas or Wichita Proper; smaller bands are listed as well: Akwits (also Akwesh, Asidahetsh, or Asidahesh, a former northern Pawnee splinter group, which joined the Wichita), Itaz, Kishkat, and Korishkitsu (the two latter names may be a Wichita name for the Kichai). The Taovaya were the most important in the 18th century. The French called the Wichita peoples Panis Piqu√©s (i.e. Pawnee Picts) or Panis Noirs (i.e. Black Pawnees), because they practiced tattooing; sometimes the Panis Piqu√©s or Panis Noirs are included into the listing of Wichita sub- tribes, but it seems that there were no known separate sub-tribe which can be identified by this name. One Pawnee splinter grouping known as Panismahas moved from what is now Nebraska to the Texas-Arkansas border regions where they lived with the Taovayas. = Language = The Wichita people had a unified language system with minor dialectical differences based on the geography of unique tribes. Derived from the Caddoan language, much of the Wichita language was indistinguishable between tribes they shared close alliances with. = Cultural institutions = In 2018, the Wichita Tribes opened the Wichita Tribal History Center in Anadarko, which shares Wichita history, archaeology, visual arts, and culture with the public. The Wichita Annual Dance, a powwow, is held at the Wichita Tribal Park on US-281, north of Anadarko, every August. =Historical Sites= Several sites spanning across different time periods are spread around the United States. These sites exist in terraces around the Red River in Oklahoma and Texas, and they contain artifacts such as pottery, arrows, knives, clay figurines, and European trade goods. Large-scale excavations of this s]s also reveal big good juciy large burial and ritualistic structures that the Wichita people used throughout history.  History  = Precontact history = The Ancestral Wichita people lived in the eastern Great Plains from the Red River in Arkansas north to Nebraska for at least 2,000 years.Schlesier, Karl H., Plains Indians, 500‚Äì1500 CE: The Archaeological Past of Historic Groups (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1994), 347-348. Early Wichita people were hunters and gatherers who gradually adopted agriculture. Farming villages were developed about 900 CE on terraces above the Washita and South Canadian Rivers in present-day Oklahoma. The women of these 10th-century communities cultivated varieties of maize, beans, and squash (known as the Three Sisters), marsh elder (Iva annua), and tobacco, which was important for religious purposes. The men hunted deer, rabbits, turkey, and, primarily, bison, and caught fish and harvested mussels from the rivers. These villagers lived in rectangular, thatched-roof houses. Archaeologists describe the Washita River Phase from 1250 to 1450, when local populations grew and villages of up to 20 houses were spaced every two or so miles along the rivers. These farmers may have had contact with the Panhandle culture villages in the Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles, farming villages along the Canadian River. The Panhandle villagers showed signs of adopting cultural characteristics of the Pueblo peoples of the Rio Grande Valley, with whom they interacted. In the late 15th century, most of these Washita River villages were abandoned for reasons that are not known today.  Great Bend settlements and council circles  Geophysical image depicting the subsurface archaeological footprint of a Great Bend aspect council circle Numerous archaeological sites in central Kansas near the Great Bend of the Arkansas River share common traits and are collectively known as the \\"Great Bend aspect.\\" Radiocarbon dates from these sites range from AD 1450 to 1700. Great Bend aspect sites are generally accepted as ancestral to the Wichita peoples described by Francisco V√°squez de Coronado and other early European explorers. The discovery of limited quantities of European artifacts, such as chain mail and iron axe heads at several Great Bend sites, suggests contact of these people with early Spanish explorers.Wood, W. Raymond (1998). Archaeology of the Great Plains University of Kansas Press. Great Bend aspect peoples' subsistence economy included agriculture, hunting, gathering, and fishing. Villages were located on the upper terraces of rivers, and crops appear to have been grown on the fertile floodplains below. Primary crops were maize, beans, squash, and sunflowers, cultivated for their seeds. Gathered foods included walnut and hickory nuts, and the fruits of plum, hackberry, and grape. Remains of animal bones in Great Aspect sites include bison, elk, deer, pronghorn, and dog,Hoard, Robert J. and William E. Banks (2006). Kansas Archaeology. University Press of Kansas one of the few domesticated animals in the pre-Contact Plains. Several village sites contain the remains of unusual structures called \\"council circles,\\" located at the center of settlements. Archaeological excavations suggest they consist of a central patio surrounded by four semi-subterranean structures. The function of the council circles is unclear. Archaeologist Waldo Wedel suggested in 1967 that they may be ceremonial structures, possibly associated with solstice observations.Wedel, Waldo (1967). \\"The Council Circles of Central Kansas: Were They Solstice Registers?\\", American Antiquity 32: pp. 54-63. Recent analysis suggests that many non-local artifacts occur exclusively or primarily within council circles, implying the structures were occupied by political and/or ritual leaders of the Great Bend aspect peoples.Vehik, Susan C. 2002. \\"Conflict, Trade, and Political Development on the Southern Plains\\", American Antiquity 67, no. 1: pp. 37‚Äì64. Other archaeologists leave open the possibility that the council circle earthworks served a defensive role.Hollinger, Eric (2005). Conflict and Culture Change in the Late Prehistoric and Early Historic American Midcontinent, PhD Dissertation. University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign. One of these sites was the city Etzanoa, located in present-day Arkansas City, Kansas, near the Arkansas River, that flourished between 1450 and 1700. = Post-contact history = Wichita camp, 1904 In 1541 Spanish explorer Francisco V√°squez de Coronado journeyed east from the Rio Grande Valley in search of a rich land called Quivira. In Texas, probably in the Blanco River Canyon near Lubbock, Coronado met people he called Teyas who might have been related to the Wichita and the earlier Plains villagers. The Teyas, if in fact they were Wichita, were probably the ancestors of the Iscani and Waco, although they might also have been the Kichai, who spoke a different language but later joined the Wichita tribe.Vehik, Susan C. \\"Wichita Cultural History.\\" Plains Anthropologist, Vol 37, No. 141, 1992, 328 Turning north, he found Quivira and the people later known as the Wichita near the town of Lyons, Kansas. He was disappointed in his search for gold as the Quivirans appear to have been prosperous farmers and good hunters but had no gold or silver. There were about 25 villages of up to 200 houses each in Quivira. Coronado said: \\"They were large people of very good build\\", and he was impressed with the land, which was \\"fat and black.\\"Winship, George Parker, The Journey of Coronado, 1540‚Äì1542, etc. New York: A.S. Barnes, 1904, 124, 215, 219 Though Coronado was impressed with Wichita society, he often treated the Wichita poorly in his expedition.Wedel, Mildred M. 1982a The Wichita Indians in the Arkansas River Basin. In Plains Indian Studies: A Collection of Papers in Honor of John C. Ewers and Waldo R. Wedel, edited by D.H. Ubelaker and H.J. Viola, pp. 118-134. Smithsonian Even after Wichita migration, some settlements were thought to have remained in northern Quivira in 1680. It was also noted: \\"They eat meat raw/jerky like the Querechos [the Apache] and Teyas. They are enemies of one another...These people of Quivira have the advantage over the others in their houses and in growing of maize\\".Brush, Rebecca. \\"The Wichita Indians\\", Texas Indians Tatum, a Wichita woman, 1898 The Quivirans apparently called their land Tancoa (which bears a resemblance to the later sub-tribe called Tawakoni) and a neighboring province on the Smoky Hill River was called Tabas (which bears a resemblance to the sub-tribe of Taovayas).Vehik, Susan C. \\"O√±ate's Expedition to the Southern Plains: Routes, Destinations, and Implications for late Prehistoric Cultural Adaptations.\\" Plains Anthropologist, Vol 31, No. 111, 1986, 28 Settlements existed here until the Wichita were driven away in the 18th century. Sixty years after Coronado's expedition the founder of New Mexico Juan de O√±ate visited Etzanoa, the Wichita city. O√±ate journeyed east from New Mexico, crossing the Great Plains and encountering two large settlements of people he called Escanjaques (possibly Yscani) and Rayados, most certainly Wichita. The Rayado city was probably on the Walnut River near Arkansas City, Kansas. O√±ate described the city as containing \\"more than twelve hundred houses\\" which would indicate a population of about 12,000. His description of the Etzanoa was similar to that of Coronado's description of Quivira. The homesteads were dispersed; the houses round, thatched with grass and surrounded by large granaries to store the corn, beans, and squash they grew in their fields.Bolton, Herbert Eugene, ed., Spanish Exploration in the Southwest, 1542‚Äì1706. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1916, 250-267 O√±ate's Rayados were certainly Wichita, probably the sub-tribe later known as the Guichitas.Vehik, \\"Wichita Cultural History,\\" p. 328 What the Coronado and O√±ate expeditions showed was that the Wichita people of the 16th century were numerous and widespread. They were not, however, a single tribe at this time but rather a group of several related tribes speaking a common language. The dispersed nature of their villages probably indicated that they were not seriously threatened by attack by enemies, although that would change as they would soon be squeezed between the Apache on the West and the powerful Osage on the East. European diseases would also probably be responsible for a large decline in the Wichita population in the 17th century. In 1719, French explorers visited two groups of Wichita. Bernard de la Harpe found a large village near present-day Tulsa, Oklahoma and Claude Charles Du Tisne found two villages near Neodesha, Kansas. Regarding religion, La Harpe noticed that the Wichita people \\"had little of it\\". He did, however, gain knowledge on the presence of a Great Spirit that the Wichita worshipped.Wedel, Mildred M. 1982a The Wichita Indians in the Arkansas River Basin. In Plains Indian Studies: A Collection of Papers in Honor of John C. Ewers and Waldo R. Wedel, edited by D.H. Ubelaker and H.J. Viola, pp. 118-134. Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge 30, Washington, D.C. Coronado's Quivira was abandoned early in the 18th century, probably due to Apache attacks. The Rayados of O√±ate were probably still living in about the same Walnut River location. Archaeologists have located a Wichita village at the Deer Creek Site dating from the 1750s on the Arkansas River east of Newkirk, Oklahoma. By 1757, however, it appears that all the Wichita had migrated south to the Red River.John, Elizabeth A. H. Storms Brewed in Other Men's Worlds. Lincoln, NE: U of Neb Press, 1975, 338 The most prominent of the Wichita sub-tribes were the Taovayas. In the 1720s they had moved south from Kansas to the Red River establishing a large village on the north side of the River at Petersburg, Oklahoma and on the south side at Spanish Fort, Texas. They adopted many traits of the nomadic Plains Indians and were noted for raiding, trading. They had a close alliance with the French, and in 1746 a French brokered alliance with the Comanche revived the fortunes of the Wichita. The village at Petersburg was \\"a lively emporium where Comanches brought Apache slaves, horses and mules to trade for French packs of powder, balls, knives, and textiles and for Taovaya-grown maize, melons, pumpkins, squash, and tobacco.\\"Elam, Earl Henry, \\"Anglo-American Relations with the Wichita Indians in Texas, 1822‚Äì1859.\\" Master's Thesis, Texas Technological College, 1967, 11 The Wichita and their Comanche allies were known to the Spanish as the ' (Northerners). The Wichita people and the Comanche attacked a Spanish military expedition in 1759. Afterwards, in response to the destruction by the of the San Saba Mission the Spanish undertook an expedition to punish the Indians. Their 500-man army attacked the twin villages on Red River, but was defeated by the Wichita and Comanche in the Battle of the Twin Villages. The Spanish suffered 19 dead and 14 wounded, leaving two cannons on the battlefield, although they claimed to have killed more than 100 Indians.John, 352 The alliance between the Wichita, especially the Taovayas, and the Comanche began to break up in the 1770s as the Wichita sought a better relationship with the Spanish. Taovaya power in Texas declined sharply after an epidemic, probably smallpox, in 1777 and 1778 killed about one-third of the tribe.Pekka Hamalainen, The Comanche Empire (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2008), p. 96 After the Americans took over their territory as a result of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and the independence of Texas in 1836, all the related tribes were increasingly lumped together and dubbed \\"Wichita.\\" That designation also included the Kichai of northern Texas, who spoke a different although a related language. The principal village of the Wichita in the 1830s was near the Wichita Mountains of Oklahoma although the Tawakoni and Wacos still lived in Texas and were moved onto a reservation on the upper Brazos River. They were forced out of Texas to a reservation in Oklahoma in 1859. During the Civil War, the Wichita allied with the Union side. They moved to Kansas, where they established a village at the site of present-day Wichita, Kansas.George Hyde, The Pawnee Indians (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1974), page 32, In 1867 they were relocated to a reservation in southwest Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma) in the area where most of them continue to reside today.http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/tribes/wichita/wichitaindianhist.htm, accessed July 15, 2010 On June 4, 1891, the affiliated tribes signed an agreement with the Cherokee Commission for individual allotments. Clashes with Texans and Americans throughout the early to mid 19th century led to the signing of a reservation treaty with America in 1846, resulting in their eventual displacement to an Oklahoman reservation in 1872.Stephen M. Perkins & Timothy G. Baugh (2008) Protohistory and the Wichita, Plains Anthropologist, 53:208, 381-394, =Relationships with Other Indigenous Tribes= For the most part, Wichita relationships were harmonious and cooperative. Notably, the Wichita were allies with the Comanche and traded with them. However, they were enemies with groups such as the Pawnee, the Missouri, and the Apache. The Apache were the Wichita's worst enemies, having driven them out of their homes before contact with Europeans. The Wichita people's relationship with the Osage is ambiguous - it is said to have been \\"cautiously hostile\\", but many Osage groups attacked them in the 18th century, eventually driving them out of the Arkansas River Basin. =Trade= Due to geographical isolation, it was difficult for the French and Spanish to trade with the Wichita. The French traded with the Wichita primarily for their horses during the 16th century. The Wichita sensed that trading with the French would be ideal. Their migration in 1714 was partly motivated by their desire to move closer to European traders. The Wichita first gained their European commodities in the mid 18th century, inspiring them to maintain close ties with the French in the 19th century. French traders were eager to exchange their goods with Wichita settlements as they traveled from Louisiana to Santa Fe.Perkins, S. M. & Drass, R. R. & Vehik, S. C. (2016). Decolonizing the Borderland: Wichita Frontier Strategies. Great Plains Quarterly 36(4), 259-280. University of Nebraska Press. Retrieved May 6, 2019, from Project MUSE database.  Population  The Wichita had a large population in the time of Coronado and O√±ate. One scholar estimates their numbers at 200,000.Smith, F. \\"Wichita Locations and Population, 1719-1901. Plains Anthropologist Vol. 53, No. 28, 2008, pp.407-414 Villages often contained around 1,000 to 1,250 people per village. Certainly they numbered in the tens of thousands. They appeared to be much reduced by the time of the first French contacts with them in 1719, probably due in large part to epidemics of infectious disease to which they had no immunity. In 1790, it was estimated there were about 3,200 total Wichita. Conflict with Texans in the early 19th century and Americans in the mid 19th century led to a major decline in population, leading to the eventual merging of Wichita settlements. By 1868, the population was recorded as being 572 total Wichita. By the time of the census of 1937, there were only 100 Wichita officially left. In 2018, 2,953 people were enrolled in the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes. In 2011, there were 2,501 enrolled Wichitas, 1,884 of whom lived in the state of Oklahoma. Enrollment in the tribe required a minimum blood quantum of 1/32.

UK  The IET defines a consumer unit, also known as a consumer control unit or electricity control unit, as \\"a particular type of distribution board comprising a type-tested co-ordinated assembly for the control and distribution of electrical energy, principally in domestic premises, incorporating manual means of double-pole isolation on the incoming circuit(s) and an assembly of one or more fuses, circuit breakers, residual current operated devices or signalling and other devices proven during the type-test of the assembly as suitable for use.\\"IET Wiring Regulations Seventeenth Edition - British Standard BS7671:2008, Part 2 Definitions  Examples  In the UK, there are four main types of Consumer Unit: * Main Switch Consumer Unit - Offers highest degree of circuit separation as all circuits must be protected from earth leakage independently. This can also be an expensive solution as it necessarily uses RCBOs instead of MCBs * Dual RCD Consumer Unit - Offers a cost-effective solution to meet 17th Edition Regulations by protecting two banks of circuits from earth leakage through the use of two RCDs. * High Integrity Consumer Unit - Usually used in larger properties with greater numbers of circuits, this type of consumer unit offers good circuit separation through the use of two or more RCDs whilst allowing for the independent use of RCBOs. Usually this type of consumer unit also allows for fully flexible configuration, meaning there is no restriction on the number of RCBOs used. * RCD Incomer Consumer Unit. Less common than the other types, an RCD incomer does not use a main switch. They are usually used as a sub-board to a main distribution panel. Modern consumer units usually use DIN-rail mount breakers. The rail and the shape of the front opening are standardized but the busbar arrangements are not. Therefore, mixing of brands should generally be avoided and, where unavoidable, care should be taken to ensure that the breaker chosen is a good fit for the busbars. The choice of consumer unit will reflect several factors such as the size and layout of the dwelling, number of floors, outbuildings, the expected load levels (ovens, showers, immersion heaters, electric blankets, car-chargers etc.), and how much protection is required for each circuit. Generally a \\"split load\\" arrangement is used with some circuits protected by the RCD, and others not. The box pictured top-right is a \\"Wylex standard\\" fitted with rewirable fuses. These boxes can also be fitted with cartridge fuses or miniature circuit breakers (MCBs). This type of consumer unit was very popular in Britain until 2001 when wiring regulations mandated residual current device (RCD) protection for sockets that could \\"reasonably be expected to\\" supply outdoor equipment (BS 7671:2001, ). There were a number of similar designs from other manufacturers but the Wylex ones are by far the most commonly encountered and the only ones for which fuseholders/breakers are still commonly available. Some manufacturers have added innovative features such as CPN Cudis who have added a LED strip light to their 'Lumo' consumer unit to enhance visibility in dark locations such as under staircases. = RCD protection types = RCD Protection Consumer Dual Split-Load Since the introduction of (BS 7671:2008 incorporating amendment no 1: 2011) 17th Edition IET Wiring Regulations, consumer units in the UK must provide RCD protection to all cables embedded in walls excepting high integrity circuits such as those for burglar alarms or smoke alarms. Consumer units have different methods of protecting circuits. For example, a dual split-load consumer unit can be arranged in a two-story dwelling as follows: RCD 1 *Upstairs Lights, *Downstairs Ring Final, *Garage Sockets, *Cooker RCD 2 *Downstairs Lights, *Upstairs Sockets, *Shower, *Heating By arranging the circuits like this, power will still be present on one of the floors if only one RCD trips out. Moreover, having sockets and lights on alternate RCD's means that if a faulty kettle downstairs trips that RCD for example, the kitchen lights will still be available, avoiding the hazard of investigating the fault in darkness. Another way to protect circuits under the 17th Edition IET Wiring Regulations is by fitting Residual Current Circuit Breaker With Overload (RCBOs) to every circuit, and although this is more costly than the RCD+MCB's option, it means any fault condition on a circuit trips only that circuit's RCBO, so the search for the fault is narrowed down from the start. When an electrician must be called out, this localised fault can be resolved faster (and therefore cheaper) in contrast with the RCD+MCB's arrangement, which only indicates a fault somewhere within that RCD's set of circuits. Some older systems such as those that use MK or old MEM Consumer Units that had one fuse per spur, so for instance: *Upstairs Lights Fuse 1 *Upstairs Sockets Fuse 2 *Downstairs Lights Fuse 3 *Downstairs Sockets Fuse 4 etc..

The prime mover for the mountain's observatory was Fred Whipple, a professor at Harvard University who was in charge of a small 25 inch mirror telescope in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In Cambridge the ambient light caused light pollution that limited the telescope's usefulness. That led to engineer Tom Hoffman being appointed by Whipple to search for a site in the U.S. that would provide a clear view of the sky at a high elevation, with minimal surrounding light pollution. After searching many locations, southern Arizona with its dry air and high elevations, and the assistance of The University of Arizona, brought Hoffman to focus on Mt Hopkins.

He was one of the founding artists of the Hyperrealist and Photorealist fine art movements.Stephen Bennett Phillips, Eric Ian Hornak Spoutz, \\"Ian Hornak Transparent Barricades,\\" exhibition catalogue, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Fine Art Program, Washington D.C., 2012Joan Adan, Eric Ian Hornak Spoutz, \\"Transparent Barricades: Ian Hornak, A Retrospective,\\" exhibition catalogue, Forest Lawn Museum, Glendale, California, May 2012 Biography Ian Hornak was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to parents who immigrated from Slovakia. The Hornak family relocated to Brooklyn, New York, when Ian Hornak was age 3 and the family then relocated again to Mount Clemens, Michigan, when he was age 8.Laura Litinsky, \\"Ian Hornak: A Profusion of Color,\\" Florida Design Magazine, Volume 1-2, June- Aug, 2001 At age 9 Hornak received a set of oil paints and a book of important Renaissance paintings from his mother as a gift. From the book he began credibly interpreting the works of Michelangelo Buonarroti, Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael Sanzio. During an interview with the 57th Street Review in 1976, Hornak remarked \\"I picked up my technique as a child through my interest in art and copying paintings I liked. I especially loved Renaissance painting, because it had clarity and simplification of form and great organization\\".Norman Lombino, \\"Interview\\", The 57th Street Review, January 1976 Upon graduating from high school in New Haven as an honors student, Hornak attended University of Michigan‚ÄìDearborn before transferring to Wayne State University in Detroit where he earned bachelor of fine arts and master of fine arts degrees. Between 1966 and 1968 he taught studio art courses at Henry Ford Community College, and Wayne State University. Hornak produced Hyperrealist and Photorealist artwork in the midst of the Pop Art movement. He was introduced in 1968 by art dealer Gertrude Kasle to Pop Artist, Lowell Blair Nesbitt. Hornak sublet one of Nesbitt‚Äôs large studios on West 14th Street in the Meatpacking District, they developed a friendship, and Nesbitt in-turn introduced Hornak into the New York City art scene. Hornak acquired a home and studio in East Hampton, New York which he used as his primary residence until his death in 2002. While living in East Hampton, Hornak befriended art world figures, Robert Motherwell, Willem de Kooning, Robert Indiana, Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg and Fairfield Porter. From 1969 until 1985 he had a secondary penthouse studio on New York City‚Äôs Upper East Side near the intersection of East 73rd Street and Park Avenue. Gallery representation Upon the recommendation of Robert Indiana, and Lowell Nesbitt, Eleanor Ward included Hornak‚Äôs artwork in his first New York City group exhibitions at the Stable Gallery between 1968 and 1969. In 1970, Lee Krasner, the widow of Jackson Pollock, introduced Hornak to Pollock‚Äôs nephew, Jason McCoy who was the assistant director of the Tibor de Nagy Gallery on West 57th Street (Manhattan) in New York City. McCoy signed Hornak to an exclusive contract with the gallery, where he had sold out solo exhibitions each year from 1971-1977. A. Aladar Marberger, director of the Fischbach Gallery on West 57th Street, signed Hornak to an exclusive contract in 1977, where Hornak had sold out solo exhibitions in 1977, 1979, 1981, and 1983. The son of Max Ernst, and stepson of Peggy Guggenheim, Jimmy Ernst recommended Hornak to the Armstrong Gallery on West 57th Street where he had a single solo exhibition in 1985. Whereas Hornak had exhibited paintings from his photorealist and hyperrealist multiple exposure and single exposure series, as well as select figurative paintings at Tibor de Nagy, and Fischbach, he chose to debut a series of Expressionistic landscape paintings at Armstrong. In contrast to the financial success and critical acclaim of all of his previous solo exhibitions, the Armstrong gallery exhibition went nearly unnoticed by the critics and was financially unsuccessful. The Katharina Rich Perlow Gallery of SoHo, Manhattan and later the Fuller Building on East 57th Street (Manhattan) signed Hornak to an exclusive contract in 1986. He debuted a series of floral and still life paintings inspired by the Dutch Golden Age which led to nine critically acclaimed, and financially successful solo exhibitions for the artist between 1986 and the artist‚Äôs death in 2002. Influences Hornak often cited the Hudson River School artists as major influences, especially Martin Johnson Heade and Frederic Edwin Church in addition to Nineteenth-Century German Romantic Artist, Caspar David Friedrich. Additionally the artist commented on his influences, *\\"What I so like about Poussin and C√©zanne is their sense of organization. I like the way in which they develop space and shape in architectural continuity - the rhythm across their paintings. When I paint a landscape, I get the greatest pleasure out of composing it. As I paint, I try to work out a visual sonata form or a fugue, with realistic images\\".Ian Hornak, exhibition catalogue, Sneed Gallery, Burpee Art Museum, 1976 Artwork Title: Hannah Tillich's Mirror: Rembrandt's Three Trees Transformed Into The Expulsion From Eden by Hornak, acrylic on canvas, 60 x 120 inches, 1978. Marcia Sewing, Variation III by Hornak, acrylic on canvas, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 1978 When Hornak began his career in New York in 1968, he created artworks that were pen & ink drawings, often erotic in subject matter. Many of Hornak‚Äôs paintings on canvas from 1968-1971 depicted human figures suspended surrealistically in space, clothed and nude, rendered with photorealistic precision in the medium of pen & ink on stark white painted acrylic backgrounds. These paintings were exhibited in group exhibitions at Eleanor Ward‚Äôs Stable Gallery. When Hornak was given his first New York solo exhibition in 1971 at the Tibor de Nagy Gallery, the gallery requested that Hornak attempt to approach a new series of work that would be more accessible to the mainstream New York art market. In response Hornak began produce multiple exposure landscape paintings as well as traditional landscape paintings. In 1985, Jimmy Ernst encouraged Hornak to create a new series of paintings, more expressionistic in technique. The result was a small series of paintings more abstract in technique, depicting apocalyptic landscapes. The paintings were the subject of Hornak‚Äôs 1985 solo exhibition at the New York City 57th Street, Armstrong Gallery. From 1986 until his death in 2002 Hornak produced Dutch & Flemish-inspired botanical and still life paintings with four to six inch painted borders, where the artist expanded the imagery of the primary painting onto the border. Hornak said of the development and creation of those paintings, \\"I begin with one flower, then add and subtract, balance and counterbalance. The finesse of the surface, the sensual appeal of the subject matter are there but the beauty lies deeper in the content. My flower pieces derive less from 19th century realists and/or impressionists, with their literal depiction of color, texture and form, and more from the 17th century Flemish painters whose flowers give visual pleasure, and imply a more generalized reality and symbolism\\". Although Hornak's earliest paintings from 1954-1969 were created using a traditional, brush application of oil paint on canvas, from 1970-1996 the artist chose to use acrylic paint before returning to oil from 1996-2002. Hornak said of his own artistic vision, \\"While I know that the beautiful, the spiritual and the sublime are today suspect, I have begun to stop resisting the constant urge to deny that beauty has a valid right to exist in contemporary art\\".Leslie Ava Shaw, \\"The Sanity of Absolute Beauty\\", Cover Magazine, Feb. 1994 Critical response In 1974 John Canaday wrote in the New York Times, \\"Mr. Hornak is right at the top of the list of romantically descriptive painters today\\".John Canaday, \\"Ian Hornak,\\" The New York Times, Jan. 12, 1974 As Hornak was nearing the end of the landscape series, Art Critic, Marcia Corbino wrote, \\"Not since the Hudson River School glorified the grandiose panorama of the natural world in meticulous detail has an American artist embraced landscape painting with the artistic totality of Ian Hornak\\".Marcia Corbino, Sarasota Herald Tribune, March 7, 1980 Gerrit Henry wrote of these works, \\"Hornak is a rather self- explanatory if not wholly tautological postmodernism. Perhaps, though, his excesses ring true for the approaching millennium: this is 'end-time' painting that exercises its romantic license to the fullest in its presentation of multiple styles of the last fin de si√®cle - naturalist, symbolist, allegorical, apocalyptic\\".Gerrit Henry, \\"Ian Hornak,\\" Art in America, July 1994 Personal life and art collection Ian Hornak, had a younger sister, Rosemary Hornak who was also a fine artist, and the sole beneficiary of his estate; and younger brother, Michael Hornak.

Together, Wolf and Hornak lived at their homes in New York City's Upper East Side and at their weekend home in East Hampton, New York where Hornak continued to live until his own death in 2002. Following Wolf's death in 1976, Frank Burton was Hornak's life partner until Burton's death in 1996. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Wolf dedicated himself to the collection of American Modernist and African American art, which he had developed a professional knowledge of during his time as assistant director of The Downtown Gallery. Later Hornak introduced Wolf to the contemporary art scene in New York City and educated him on the current trends in visual culture. Together Wolf and Hornak assembled a large collection of artwork and upon Wolf's death in 1976, per Wolf and Hornak's wishes, John G.

The battle was a chance encounter between two Japanese destroyers that had been undertaking a resupply run to Vila and a U.S. Navy force of three light cruisers and three destroyers that had been tasked with bombarding the Japanese shore facilities around Vila. The two forces clashed as the Japanese destroyers were withdrawing through the Kula Gulf. In the short battle that followed the two Japanese destroyers were sunk after which the U.S. ships completed their bombardment of Vila before returning to their base. Background After the American victory in the Guadalcanal campaign in early 1943, operations in the Solomon Islands shifted to the west, where the Japanese maintained a substantial garrison on Kolombangara. Airbases had been established at Munda, on the western coast of New Georgia, and at Vila on the southern coast of Kolombangara. Allied efforts to reduce these airbases initially focused on air strikes, but later included naval bombardment in preparation for a ground campaign to capture New Georgia that would eventually commence in late June and early July 1943. Meanwhile, the Japanese continued to build up these bases as part of their efforts to reinforce the southern defenses to their main base around Rabaul.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 106Stille, The Solomons 1943‚Äì44, backcover & p. 42 Kula Gulf separates Kolombangara from New Georgia to the southeast. On the night of 5 March 1943, the Japanese destroyers and took supplies to the Japanese base at Vila, on Kolombangara.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 107 Together, these ships formed part of the 2nd Fleet's Destroyer Squadron 4, which was under the command of Captain Masao Tachibana. Their passage to Vila was undertaken through the Vella Gulf and Blackett Strait, while they decided to return to the Shortland Islands via the shorter route through the Kula Gulf.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, pp. 107‚Äì108 Battle As the Japanese ships withdrew through the Kula Gulf after landing their cargo, they encountered Task Force 68 (TF 68), consisting of three light cruisers (, , and ) and three destroyers (, , and ) commanded by Rear Admiral Aaron S. Merrill. This force was en route to commence bombarding Japanese positions at Vila. Two submarines, Grayback and Grampus, had been assigned to support Merrill's force, and were stationed along likely Japanese withdrawal routes out of the Kula Gulf. Merrill's attack on Vila was timed to coincide with another attack on Munda by four destroyers under Captain Robert Briscoe. In a short battle, both Japanese destroyers were sunk. The U.S. force was proceeding in a southwesterly direction about off the New Georgia coast, cruising at about . Meanwhile, the Japanese ships were sailing in the opposite direction along the east coast of Kolombangara, northeast from Sasamboki Island, roughly offshore from Stanmore. First contact was established by the U.S. radar operators around 00:57 on 6 March and firing commenced at 01:01. The U.S. cruisers engaged to starboard with their 6-inch guns at a range of around . Radar controlled gunnery was in its infancy as a technique and there was a tendency for the initial barrage to fall on the same, usually nearest, target. In earlier naval battles in the Pacific, this tactical deficiency had allowed the Japanese to successfully engage attacking U.S. ships with torpedoes and had resulted in several losses for U.S. forces previously. In this case, the entire opening salvo straddled Murasame. As Minegumos captain began passing orders to his crew, Murasame was hit by the sixth salvo of American gunfire, which was followed shortly afterwards by a salvo of five torpedoes that had been fired by the destroyer Waller. At around 01:15, one of these torpedoes hit Murasame, which exploded, caught fire and eventually sank. The explosion was reportedly heard by Briscoe's force about away around Munda.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, pp. 108‚Äì109 The U.S. cruisers then rapidly shifted target, doing so before Minegumo could release any torpedoes. Radarscope image from Denver at around 01:00, just before opening fire. The large spot just off the Kolombangara shore is the Japanese destroyers Minegumo and Murasame. Meanwhile, Minegumo attempted to return fire, aiming for the flashes of the U.S. gun batteries off their starboard bow. After a few minutes, though, the second Japanese destroyer was also hit and began sinking in short order. As the surviving Japanese crew abandoned ship, firing ceased at 01:14. After the engagement, the U.S. vessels completed a turn to starboard when they were roughly due east of the Blackett Strait and north of Tunguirili Point. At 01:24, they commenced a northerly bombardment run off the Kolombangara coast, having been delayed by only 16 minutes. Under the direction of a reconnaissance aircraft flying overhead, the U.S. gunners targeted \\"supply dumps, runways, bivouacs and dispersed aircraft\\", according to Samuel Morison. The bombardment was reportedly very destructive and accurate. Several Japanese shore batteries responded, firing on the bombarding ships, but were knocked out quickly with counter battery fire. After completing their task at 01:40, Merrill's force withdrew through the New Georgia Sound.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, pp. 109‚Äì110 Aftermath A total of 174 Japanese sailors lost their lives during the battle on 6 March; 128 of these were from Murasame, while the rest were from Minegumo. The survivors swam to shore on Kolombangara. Fifty-three survivors from Murasame and 122 from Minegumo managed to reach Japanese lines. Two other survivors from Minegumo were later captured by U.S. forces.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, p. 110 One of the U.S. submarines assigned to support the operation, Grampus, went missing and did not return to base at the end of its patrol. The submarine's fate remains unknown and it is uncertain if it was lost as a result of actions during the Blackett Strait operation or before. It was officially listed a missing, presumed lost on or before 3 March although there is a possibility it was attacked by Minegumo during the evening of 5/6 March. =Mining operations= On 20 March, the Allies began mining operations in the central Solomons using U.S. Navy and Marine Corps torpedo bombers to sow mines throughout the northern Solomons. After a month, these operations were briefly suspended as a result of Operation I-Go due to the need to free up AirSols aircraft to respond in the event of further attacks. In May, these operations resumed. On 7 May, the minelayers , , and , escorted by , laid mines across Blackett Strait in an attempt to interdict Japanese ships traveling through the strait. The next day, the Japanese destroyers , , and all hit mines in that area. Kuroshio sank immediately. Kagero and Oyashio sank later that day after being attacked and further damaged by U.S. aircraft from Henderson Field following a radio report from an Australian coastwatcher on Kolombangara.Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, pp. 112‚Äì115 =PT-109= Later in the year, with the ground campaign around Munda reaching a climax, another engagement occurred in Blackett Strait when a force of 15 PT boats, including Lieutenant (Junior Grade) John F. Kennedy's PT-109 were sent to intercept the \\"Tokyo Express\\" supply convoy on 2 August. In what National Geographic called a \\"poorly planned and badly coordinated\\" attack, 15 boats with 60 available torpedoes went into action. However, of the 30 torpedoes fired by PT boats from four sections, not a single hit was scored.Donovan, PT-109: John F. Kennedy in WW II, pp. 95‚Äì99. In the battle, only four PT boats (the section leaders) had radar, and they were ordered to return to base after firing their torpedoes on radar bearings. When they left, the remaining boats were virtually blind. Patrolling just after the section leader had departed for home, PT-109 was run down on a dark moonless night by the Japanese destroyer , returning from the supply mission.Donovan, PT-109: John F. Kennedy in WW II, pp. 73, 100‚Äì107. The PT boat had her engines at idle to hide her wake from seaplanes.Donovan, PT-109: John F. Kennedy in WW II, pp. 60‚Äì61, 100. Conflicting statements have been made as to whether the destroyer captain spotted and steered towards the boat. Members of the destroyer crew believed the collision was not an accident, though other reports suggest Amagiri's captain had not intentionally rammed PT-109.Donovan, PT-109: John F. Kennedy in WW II, pp. 105, 108‚Äì109. Kennedy's crew was assumed lost by the U.S. Navy,Morison, Breaking the Bismarcks Barrier, pp. 211‚Äì212 but were found later by Solomon Islander scouts Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana.

Duncan (pop. 4,944) is a city on southern Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. Location The city is about 45 kilometres from both Victoria to the south and Nanaimo to the north. Although the City of Duncan has a population of just under 5,000, it serves the Cowichan Valley which has a population of approximately 84,000, many of whom live in North Cowichan and Cowichan Tribes. This gives Duncan a much larger perceived \\"greater\\" population than that contained within the city limits. People in areas of North Cowichan and bordering on Duncan usually use \\"Duncan\\" as their mailing address. Duncan has one seat on the Cowichan Valley Regional District Board. The name Cowichan is an Anglicization of Halkomelem , which means \\"the warm land\\". Transportation The city is served by Trans-Canada Highway which connects the city to points north/south. Highway 1 through Duncan is a four-lane street with two signalized intersections (within the city limits) and a speed limit of 50 km/hr. British Columbia Highway 18 connects Duncan (via North Cowichan) to the town of Lake Cowichan to the west. The Island Corridor Foundation railway continues to cross Duncan, though passenger and freight rail service on the south island corridor were both discontinued. Public transit is provided in conjunction between BC Transit and the Cowichan Valley Regional Transit System. The service provides connections from Duncan to the surrounding communities as well as regular commuter bus service to Victoria. History The community is named after William Chalmers Duncan (born 1836 in Sarnia, Ontario). He arrived in Victoria in May 1862, then in August of that year he was one of the party of a hundred settlers which Governor Douglas took to Cowichan Bay. After going off on several gold rushes, Duncan settled close to the present City of Duncan. He married in 1876, and his son Kenneth became the first Mayor of Duncan. There is a Kenneth Street, as well as a Duncan Street, in the City. Duncan's farm was named Alderlea, and this was the first name of the adjacent settlement. In August 1886, the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway was opened. No stop had been scheduled at Alderlea for the inaugural train bearing Sir John A. Macdonald and Robert Dunsmuir. However, at Duncan's Crossing, the level crossing nearest Alderlea, a crowd of 2,000 had assembled around a decorated arch and the train came to an unplanned halt, quite literally putting it on the map. In the early 1900s, Duncan's Chinatown was the social centre for the Cowichan Valley's Chinese population. Chinatown was concentrated in a single block in the southwestern corner of Duncan. At its largest point, Duncan's Chinatown included six Chinese families and 30 merchants who supplied goods and services to the loggers, millworkers, cannery and mine workers in the area. The city tore the buildings down in 1969 to build a new law courts complex. Some materials from the original buildings were used at Whippletree Junction.From Camp to Community - Where They Came From - China In the 1980s, the city was noted in coverage related to the 1985 bombings at Narita Airport in Japan and aboard Air India Flight 182, Canada's largest murder case. Resident Inderjit Singh Reyat purchased bomb parts and a radio at Duncan stores, and used the radio to conceal the bomb. Less than two weeks prior to the bombings, Reyat and suspected Air India mastermind Talwinder Singh Parmar were observed testing explosives in the woods outside of Duncan by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS).Sikh probe took wrong turn after Duncan blast: former CSIS agent, CBC News, May 24, 2007 Tourist attractions The City of Duncan was incorporated in 1912 and is known for one of the largest totem pole collections. The City was officially named \\"City of Totems\\" in 1985. The City had 44 totem poles in the collection, however one was destroyed in an auto accident, one was gifted to Kaikohe, New Zealand and one returned to earth. In 2007, the City of Duncan deemed copyright privileges of the totem poles. The use of the totems' images for commercial purposes requires the City of Duncan's approval.The Globe and Mail. The Cowichan Historical Society (Museum) provides free totem tours in the summer months. Duncan has a large Indigenous community and is the traditional home of the Cowichan Tribes, who are the largest band among the Coast Salish people. The Coast Salish men and women of the Cowichan Tribes are makers of the world-famous Cowichan Sweaters. Before the Canada‚ÄìUnited States softwood lumber dispute, Duncan and the whole Cowichan Valley were a thriving lumber centre in British Columbia. Cowichan Community Centre is located in the jurisdiction of the Municipality of North Cowichan, and serves purpose for all citizens in the Cowichan Valley Regional District (CVRD). The centre has the world's largest hockey stick which was made specifically for Expo 86 in Vancouver, and purchased by CVRD at the end of the event. In 1911, Norman Corfield drove the first car over the Malahat Highway, opening up vehicle traffic to Duncan. Construction of the Duncan Garage Heritage Building started in 1912 and appeared in Canadian Motorist Magazine (May 1913 issue) as \\"The most complete and up-to-date fireproof garage on Vancouver Island.\\" The Duncan Garage set a provincial record for the longest operating business in one location (65 years). It was designated a heritage building in 2002. Climate According to the K√∂ppen climate classification, Duncan has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen Csb). Education Duncan is part of British Columbia's School District 79 Cowichan Valley. It has one independent school. Queen Margaret's School, established in 1921, as a private secondary university preparatory school for girls which includes a co-ed junior school. Vancouver Island University (formerly Malaspina University-College) has a regional campus in the Municipality of North Cowichan, bordering Duncan, that offers a Bachelor of Education degree as well as programs and courses in university transfer, access, trades and applied technology, health and human services, and career and academic preparation. The campus also has a Continuing Education department that offers certificate programs, personal and professional development courses, and online courses. The current campus opened for classes in June 2011. Also bordering Duncan in the Municipality of North Cowichan, there are two public secondary schools, Cowichan Secondary School, and Quamichan Secondary School, as well as several elementary schools. The head offices of School District 79 Cowichan Valley are also located in North Cowichan. In the Cowichan region there are also has two denominational independent schools: Queen of Angels (Catholic school), serving preschool to Grade 9 students, and Duncan Christian School, whose campus is home to both an independent elementary and high school. Sunrise Waldorf School is a non-denominational K-8 independent school offering Waldorf education in the Cowichan Valley. Sports The Cowichan Community Sportsplex is located on the border of Duncan, but in the Municipality of North Cowichan and is the home of the British Columbia Hockey League's Cowichan Valley Capitals, who play in the Cowichan Community Sportsplex. It is home to a number of other sports and athletics organizations including the Cowichan Valley Athletic Club's (CVAC) Jaguars one of the many clubs and teams that practice & compete out of the extensive Cowichan Sportsplex.

A professional trust company may be independently owned or owned by, for example, a bank or a law firm, and which specializes in being a trustee of various kinds of trusts. The \\"trust\\" name refers to the ability to act as a trustee ‚Äì someone who administers financial assets on behalf of another. The assets are typically held in the form of a trust, a legal instrument that spells out who the beneficiaries are and what the money can be spent for. A trustee will manage investments, keep records, manage assets, prepare court accounting, pay bills (depending on the nature of the trust), medical expenses, charitable gifts, inheritances or other distributions of income and principal. Estate administration A trust company can be named as an executor or personal representative in a last will and testament. The responsibilities of an executor in settling the estate of a deceased person include collecting debts, settling claims for debt and taxes, accounting for assets to the courts and distributing wealth to beneficiaries. Estate planning is usually also offered to allow clients to structure their affairs so as to minimize inheritance taxes and probate costs. In the United States, one of the primary profit centers for a trust company is commissions earned from selling various types of insurance products designed to minimize the estate tax charged to a person. A trust officer may provide guardian and conservator services, acting as guardian of a minor's property until adulthood or as conservator of the estate of an adult unable to handle his or her own finances. =Environmental and historic preservation trusts= Some trust companies are formed not merely for the benefit of a minor or an individual trustee, but for the preservation of nature or historic sites. Asset management A trust department provides investment management, including securities market advice, investment strategy and portfolio management, management of real estate and safekeeping of valuables. Escrow services The trust company may also provide escrow services, invest education or retirement funds or hold 1031 Exchange proceeds where cash from the sale of US real estate is held in trust (for tax purposes) until used to buy replacement land. Corporate trust services Trust companies may also perform corporate trust services. Corporate trust services are services which assist, in the fiduciary capacity, in the administration of the corporation's debt. For example, in a normal bank loan, the lender normally lends money to the company (usually with conditions called \\"covenants\\"), accepts payments from the company monthly, and monitors the financial conditions of the company to ensure that it is meeting all its agreed upon conditions (for example, that its ratio of profits to expenses stays above a certain amount). However most large companies borrow money not from banks, but by selling bonds. When the company sells bonds, a corporate trust company can handle the acceptance of payments from the company (which it passes on to the bondholders), and is the entity which monitors the company to ensure it is meeting covenants. In the event of the company's bankruptcy, the corporate trust company represents the interests of the bondholders and acts to recover as much of the loan proceeds as possible.

Background Designed and first manufactured in 1925, it was for many years the most compact 35 mm motion picture film camera, having a 100-foot film capacity. Its small size and ruggedness made it a favorite choice for newsreel and combat cameramen (it was used throughout World War II and the Vietnam War, the War Department providing special manuals for it), and also found use for fiction and documentary filmmakers whenever a portable, rugged, and inconspicuous camera was needed. The Eyemo is still in use by some filmmakers. It is often used these days as a \\"crash-cam\\" for filming dangerous stunts and explosions, and shots in which the camera must be dropped from a building or other elevation. Construction Eyemo with Motor and Nikon Lens The Eyemo is a non-reflex camera: viewing while filming is through an optical viewfinder incorporated into the camera lid. Some models take one lens only. In 1929 there was the first three-port Eyemo, while the \\"spider model\\" features a rotating three-lens turret and a \\"focusing viewfinder\\" on the side opposite the optical viewfinder. Eyemos feature a 1¬Ω\\" diameter lens mount except the 71-k model, which is slightly different. Eyemos feature a built-in clockwork (spring wind) motor which, when wound by a ratchet key, runs about 20 seconds of film per winding at standard 24 fps (frames per second) speed, and also runs at speeds of four through 64 fps, depending on the model. The camera can be hand-cranked with a manual crank accessory. Several optional electric motors are available; some use DC battery power while others use household AC current. There is currently a synchronized motor available for sync sound filming, but no commercially available camera blimp to reduce the camera's noise. The Eyemo takes an internal load of 100 feet (30,5 m) of film, which lasts just over one minute when filming at 24 fps. Some models also accept a 400 ft or 1000 ft magazine that is attached to the back, and can hold 4‚Öì and 11 minutes of film respectively. When used with a 400 ft magazine, the Eyemo is cumbersome (but not impossible) to operate without the use of a tripod, while the use of a 1000-ft magazine requires tripod support. Some camera shops have modified Eyemos for reflex viewing, attached video taps and motors to them, and modified the proprietary lens mount to allow the camera to use different optics (such as lenses made for still Nikon cameras). Bell & Howell also built the successful 16 mm \\"Filmo\\" which became first available at the end of 1923. In the 1930s this camera was marketed as a 'semi professional' camera while the Filmo 127 was introduced as an amateur camera using 8 mm film.

It was officially ruled as a forward fumble by Raiders quarterback Ken Stabler that was recovered by his teammate, tight end Dave Casper, in the end zone for a touchdown, ultimately giving Oakland the 21‚Äì20 win. However, there have been differing interpretations of how this play should have actually been ruled, and it has remained a controversial play for fans of both teams involved. The NFL amended its rules after the 1978 season in order to prevent a recurrence of the play. Chargers fans refer to the play as the Immaculate Deception. Had the Chargers won this game, and had all other games that season remained with the same outcome, they would have made the playoffs taking the fifth seed over the Houston Oilers, by virtue of a tiebreaker. Both the Chargers and Oilers would have finished with a 10-6 record, but the Chargers' final game of the season was a victory over the Oilers, so the Chargers would have won the tiebreaker on a head-to-head matchup and clinched the fifth seed in the postseason. The final Houston-San Diego game therefore would have had direct playoff consequence, with the winner advancing to the playoffs and the loser being eliminated. The play With 10 seconds left in the game, the Raiders had possession of the ball at the Chargers' 14-yard line, trailing 20‚Äì14. Raiders quarterback Ken Stabler took the snap and found himself about to be sacked by Chargers linebacker Woodrow Lowe on the 24-yard line. The ball came out of Stabler's hands and moved forward towards the Chargers' goal line. Raiders running back Pete Banaszak appeared to try to recover the ball on the 12-yard line, but did not keep his footing, and pitched the ball with both hands even closer to the end zone. Raiders tight end Dave Casper was the next player to reach the ball but he also seemingly could not get a handle on it. He batted and kicked the ball into the end zone, where he fell on it for the game-tying touchdown as time ran out. With the ensuing extra point by placekicker Errol Mann, the Raiders won 21‚Äì20. According to the NFL rulebook, \\"If a runner intentionally fumbles forward, it is a forward pass.\\" Also during the play, the game officials ruled that Banaszak and Casper's actions were legal because it was impossible to determine if they intentionally batted the ball forward, which would have been ruled a penalty. The National Football League (NFL) also supported referee Jerry Markbreit's call that Stabler fumbled the ball instead of throwing it forward. For years, Stabler publicly stated that it was a fumble. However, in a 2008 interview on NFL Films, he was asked if he could convince the camera crew that he did not flip the ball forward. Stabler responded, \\"No, I can't convince you of that, because I did. I mean, what else was I going to do with it? Throw it out there, shake the dice.\\" Banaszak and Casper also admitted that they deliberately batted the ball towards the end zone. Reaction Chargers fans responded with T-shirts depicting a blindfolded referee signaling a touchdown along with the words Immaculate Deception. The nickname was a play off the Immaculate Reception, a play that went against the Raiders in the 1972 playoffs against Pittsburgh. In response to the Holy Roller, the league passed new rules in the off-season, restricting fumble advances by the offense. If a player fumbles after the two- minute warning in a half/overtime, or on fourth down at any time during the game, only the fumbling player can recover and advance the ball. If that player's teammate recovers the ball during those situations, it is placed back at the spot of the fumble, unless it was a recovery for a loss, in which case the ball is dead and placed at the point of recovery. The Holy Roller play was directly referenced on December 14, 2014 in response to a critical play in the Green Bay Packers' loss to the Buffalo Bills. When Aaron Rodgers had the ball knocked out of his hand by Mario Williams, it rolled backwards into the end zone and came to a complete stop; Packer RB Eddie Lacy picked up the ball and tried to run with it, but the referee approached quickly, waving his hands to declare the play dead, and after talking to the back judge, signaled a safety for Buffalo. The NFL Director of Officiating said that since the Holy Roller rules were in place, the only person who could have picked up the fumble and advanced it for Green Bay was the original fumbler (Rodgers) and the safety call was correct.

Geography The three main roads of the original development of Foxrock remain Brighton, Torquay and Westminster Roads. The boundaries of Foxrock as used by An Post extend east to take in the lands to the west of Clonkeen Road, Deansgrange Cemetery as far as Newtownpark Avenue. The N11 road runs through the area, as does a small stream. Foxrock borders the suburbs of Carrickmines, Cornelscourt, Deansgrange and Leopardstown. Education Foxrock has a number of primary schools, and one secondary school for girls only, Loreto Convent, Foxrock. Hollypark Boys and Girls primary schools also service the area. Transport =Rail= Foxrock was formerly served by the Harcourt Street line from central Dublin's Harcourt Street to Bray. A temporary platform opened in 1859 followed by a more permanent station in August 1861, finally closing in January 1959. Foxrock is bypassed by the Luas Green Line light rail system which deviates from the old railway line. The nearest Luas stop to Foxrock (not counting the unused stop at Leopardstown Racecourse) is at Carrickmines, which is where the Green Line rejoins the old railway route. =Bus= Dublin Bus high frequency services 46A and the 145 links Foxrock Church with the City Centre.

Life He born at Hampton Court Green on 29 September 1818, was third son of Hugh Blaydes (1777‚Äì1829) of High Paull, Yorkshire, and of Ranby Hall, Nottinghamshire, J.P. and high sheriff for the latter county; his mother was Delia Maria, second daughter of Colonel Richard Wood of Hollin Hall, Yorkshire. James Blaides of Hull, who married on 25 March 1615 Anne, sister of the poet Andrew Marvell, was a direct ancestor. After his father's death in 1829, Blaydes was sent to a private school at Boulogne, and then, on 14 September 1831, to St. Peter's School, York, where he became a free scholar in June 1832 and gained an exhibition before matriculating at Oxford, 20 October 1836, as a commoner of Christ Church. John Ruskin, about five months his junior, was already a gentleman commoner there, and Thomas Gaisford was dean. In 1838, Blaydes was elected Hertford scholar and was a student of Christ Church, and in Easter term 1840 was placed in the second class in literae humaniores along with George Webbe Dasent and James Anthony Froude. He graduated B.A. in 1840, proceeding M.A. in 1843. After a long tour through France and Italy in 1840-1, finally spending a week in Athens, he returned to Oxford in August 1841, and issued an edition of Aristophanes' Birds (1842), with short Latin notes. He was ordained deacon in 1842 and priest in 1843, he accepted the college living of Harringworth, Northamptonshire. Harringworth was Blaydes' home for forty-three years (1843‚Äì86). A staunch 'Protestant,' he joined on 10 December 1850 the deputation from his university which, headed by the Chancellor, the Duke of Wellington, presented an address to Queen Victoria against the 'papal aggression'. But Blaydes' interest and ample leisure were mainly absorbed by classical study. In 1845, he published an edition of a second play of Aristophanes the Acharnians. In 1859, he published in the Bibliotheca classica three plays of Sophocles. The reception of the book was not altogether favourable, and a difference with the publishers led him to issue separately the four remaining plays with Williams & Norgate. He reckoned that he gave more than twenty years to Sophocles, and, with intervals, more than fifty to Aristophanes. Blaydes resigned his benefice in 1884, and from 1886 lived at Brighton. In 1907, he moved to Southsea, where he died, retaining his vigour till near the end, on 7 September 1908; he was buried in Brighton Cemetery. Family Blaydes married first, in 1843, Fanny Maria Page-Turner, one of the co-heiresses of Sir Edward George Thomas Page-Turner, of Ambrosden, Oxfordshire, and Battlesden, Bedfordshire; she was killed in a carriage accident, 21 August 1884, leaving three sons and four daughters. Blaydes' second wife was Emma Nichols.

History In the 1980s Hugo Morales, a radio station executive sought to establish a Hispanic radio station in the Denver area as part of his organization Radio Biling√ºe. Florence Hern√°ndez-Ramos(born 1950), a graduate of Lamar High School and the University of Colorado at Boulder, helped establish the station. Hern√°ndez- Ramos had attended the Colorado School of Law to follow her passion for civil rights. She met Morales while working as a paralegal in the Colorado attorney general's office in 1982. Given her law background in civil rights and interest in increasing Hispanic representation, Hern√°ndez-Ramos was drawn into Morales‚Äô cause. She conducted research on how such a station could be put on the air and secured the grants necessary to fund it.

His father-in-law is the translator, novelist, and occasional critic Kotaka Nobumitsu. Work Hiroki Azuma is one of the most influential young literary critics in Japan, focusing on literature and on the idea of individual liberty in an age of ubiquitous information. He began writing inspired by the work of Kojin Karatani and Akira Asada. He is an associate of Takashi Murakami and the Superflat movement. His publishing debut was \\"Solzhenitsyn Essay\\" in 1993. Azuma handed the work directly to Karatani during his lecture series at Hosei University which Azuma was auditing. Azuma launched his career as a literary critic in 1993 with a postmodern style influenced by leading Japanese critics Kojin Karatani and Akira Asada. In the late 1990s, Azuma began examining various pop phenomena, especially the emerging otaku/Internet/video game culture, and became widely known as an advocate of the thoughts of a new generation of Japanese. He is interested in the transformation of the Japanese literary imagination under its current ‚Äúotaku-ization.‚Äù Azuma has published seven books, including Sonzaironteki, Yubinteki (Ontological, Postal) in 1998, which focuses on Jacques Derrida's oscillation between literature and philosophy. This work won the Suntory Literary Prize in 2000 and made Azuma the youngest writer to ever win that prize. Akira Asada stated that it is one of the best books written in the 90s; however, Hiroo Yamagata pointed out that the book is based on the misunderstanding of G√∂del's incompleteness theorem. He also wrote Dobutsuka- suru Postmodern (Animalizing Postmodernity) (translated as Otaku: Japan's Database Animals in 2001), which analyzes Japanese pop culture through a postmodern lens. He has also set up a non-profit organization to encourage cutting-edge critics who might be shut out of the existing publishing world. Works * Azuma, Hiroki.

He works in fine arts media (such as painting and sculpture) as well as commercial media (such as fashion, merchandise, and animation) and is known for blurring the line between high and low arts. He coined the term \\"superflat\\", which describes both the aesthetic characteristics of the Japanese artistic tradition and the nature of postwar Japanese culture and society, and is also used for Murakami's artistic style and other Japanese artists he has influenced. Murakami is the founder and President of Kaikai Kiki Co., Ltd., through which he manages several younger artists. He was the founder and organizer of the biannual art fair Geisai. Life and career =Academic background and early career= Artist Takashi Murakami with early work \\"Polyrhythm\\" at Galerie Mars in Tokyo 1992. Photo by Ithaka Darin Pappas Murakami was born and raised in Tokyo, Japan. From early on, he was a fan of anime and manga (Japanese comics), and hoped to work in the animation industry. He attended Tokyo University of the Arts to acquire the drafting skills necessary to become an animator, but eventually majored in Nihonga, the 'traditional' style of Japanese painting that incorporates traditional Japanese artistic conventions, techniques and subjects. Though he would go on to earn a Ph.D. in Nihonga, he gradually became disillusioned with its insular, highly political world and started to explore more contemporary artistic styles, media, and strategies. Murakami was dissatisfied with the state of contemporary art in Japan, believing it to be \\"a deep appropriation of Western trends.\\" Thus, much of his early work was done in the spirit of social criticism and satire. On an article naming and explaining all of Murakami's pieces lies the infamous My Lonesome Cowboy, a companion to his earlier Hiropon. The sculpture is that of a naked anime character with blond spiky hair with a spiral trail of semen circling him. This piece is Murakami's most expensive piece to date selling for $13,500,000 at Sothbye's New York auction in 2008. Efforts from this period include performance art (Osaka Mixer Project, 1992), parodies of the \\"message\\" art popular in Japan in the early '90s, (Dobozite Dobozite Oshamanbe, 1993), and conceptual works (e.g. Randoseru Project, 1991). He also began developing his own pop icon, \\"Mr. DOB,\\" which would later develop into a form of self- portraiture, the first of several endlessly morphing and recurring motifs seen throughout his work. Though he garnered attention, many of his early pieces were not initially well received in Japan. =New York= In 1994, Murakami received a fellowship from the Asian Cultural Council and participated in the PS1 International Studio Program in New York City for a year. During his stay, he was exposed to and highly inspired by Western contemporary artists such as Anselm Kiefer and especially the simulationism of artists such as Jeff Koons. He established a small studio, which, together with the Hiropon Factory in Japan, became the precursor to his company Kaikai Kiki. After returning to Japan, he would develop the core concepts behind his artistic practice and begin exhibiting regularly at major galleries and institutions across Europe and America. =Strategic approach= Cosmos Ball by Takashi Murakami, molded plastic, 2000, Honolulu Museum of Art Murakami has expressed since early on a frustration with the lack of a reliable and sustainable art market in postwar Japan. Largely for this reason, he formulated a strategy wherein he would first establish himself in the Western art world and then import himself back to Japan, building a new type of art market in the process. In order to create something rooted in his own Japanese culture and history but still fresh and valid internationally, he began searching for something that could be considered 'uniquely Japanese.' After concluding that elements of 'high' art were confounding at best, he began to focus on Japan's 'low' culture, especially anime and manga, and the larger subculture of otaku. His artistic style and motifs (cute/disturbing anime-esque characters rendered in bright colors, flat and highly glossy surfaces, life-size sculptures of anime figurines) derived from this strategy. This is demonstrated in his whimsical Cosmos Ball from 2000, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art. =Superflat= In 2000, Murakami published his \\"Superflat\\" theory in the catalogue for a group exhibition of the same name that he curated for the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. The theory posits that there is a legacy of flat, 2-dimensional imagery from Japanese art history in manga and anime. This style differentiates itself from the western approach in its emphasis on surface and use of flat planes of color. Superflat also served as a commentary on postwar Japanese society in which, Murakami argues, differences in social class and popular taste have 'flattened,' producing a culture with little distinction between 'high' and 'low'. The theory provided the context for his work and he elaborated on it with the exhibitions \\"Coloriage\\" (2002, Fondation Cartier pour l'art contemporain, Paris) and \\"Little Boy: The Arts of Japan's Exploding Subculture\\" (2005, Japan Society, New York). These helped introduce Japan's lesser-known creative culture overseas and such curatorial projects would become an integral part of Murakami's multifaceted artistic practice. In the past decade, Murakami's curatorship expanded to include Kazunori Hamana, Yuji Ueda, and Otani Workshop at Blum & Poe, New York (2016) and Juxtapox x Superflat at Vancouver Art Gallery (2016). In accordance with the Superflat concept, Murakami's practice involves repackaging elements usually considered \\"low\\" or subcultural and presenting them in the \\"high-art\\" market. He then further flattens the playing field by repackaging his \\"high-art\\" works as merchandise, such as plush toys and T-shirts, making them available at more affordable prices. =Factory= In 1996, Murakami launched the Hiropon Factory, his production workshop, in order to work on a larger scale and in a more diverse array of media. His model inherits the atelier system which has long existed in Japanese painting, printmaking and sculpture and is common to anime and manga enterprises, such as Hayao Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli. In 2001, Hiropon Factory was incorporated as Kaikai Kiki Co., Ltd. =Collaborations= In 2002, at the invitation of designer Marc Jacobs, Murakami began his long-lasting collaboration with the fashion brand Louis Vuitton. He began by contributing artwork which was used in the design of a series of handbags. The series re-envisioned the company's monogram and was a huge commercial success. Though he had previously collaborated with fashion designers such as Issey Miyake Men by Naoki Takizawa, his work with Louis Vuitton made him widely known for blurring the line between 'high art' and commercialism. It also elevated him to celebrity status in his home country of Japan. In 2007, Murakami provided the cover artwork for rapper Kanye West's album Graduation and directed an animated music video for West's song \\"Good Morning\\". He also provided cover artwork for West's 2018 collaboration album Kids See Ghosts with Kid Cudi. For Graduation and \\"Good Morning\\", Murakami would later 're-appropriate' these projects by incorporating their imagery into his paintings and sculptures, further blurring the boundaries between art and commercial branding and even questioning the existence of such a boundary. Asked about straddling the line between art and commercial products, Murakami responded: > I don't think of it as straddling. I think of it as changing the line. What > I've been talking about for years is how in Japan, that line is less > defined. Both by the culture and by the post-War economic situation. > Japanese people accept that art and commerce will be blended; and in fact, > they are surprised by the rigid and pretentious Western hierarchy of \\"high > art.\\" In the West, it certainly is dangerous to blend the two because people > will throw all sorts of stones. But that's okay‚ÄîI'm ready with my hard hat. Murakami has also collaborated with a wide range of creators and industries in Japan, a prominent example being the image characters he created for the press relations campaign of the major urban real estate development Roppongi Hills. In 2009, music producer Pharrell Williams unveiled a collaborative sculpture with Murakami at Art Basel, which Williams stated \\"illustrates the metaphor of value.\\" Murakami and McG directed short Akihabara Majokko Princess, where Kirsten Dunst sings a cover of The Vapors' 1980 song \\"Turning Japanese\\". This was shown at the \\"Pop Life\\" exhibition in London's Tate Modern museum from October 1, 2009, to January 17, 2010. It shows Dunst dancing around Akihabara, a shopping district in Tokyo, Japan. In May 2014, with Pharrell and kz of livetune, Murakami created a music video for the remix of the Hatsune Miku song \\"Last Night, Good Night (Re:Dialed)\\". The team was assembled by the YouTube channel The Creators Project, headed by Vice and Intel. The same year, Murakami's anime-inspired illustrations from his first film Jellyfish Eyes, also adorned a T-shirt by Billionaire Boys Club, the brand co-founded by Pharrell and Nigo. In 2018, Takashi Murakami collaborated with fashion designer Virgil Abloh on a series of artworks, bringing the fashion world to the art world but ultimately transcending both to create something more. Takashi and Virgil discuss their careers and their collaboration at length in their interview for Cultured Magazine's fall 2018 issue where they are featured on the cover. In March 2019, Billie Eilish released the official music video for you should see me in a crown, directed and animated by Takashi Murakami. Murakami stated in a press release that the anime-style video, which was animated using motion capture technology, took eight months for him to create. The video opens with an animated version of Eilish, dressed in a neon- green shirt and shorts, eventually morphing into a spider-like monster that wreaks havoc on a miniature city. The video features the \\"Blohsh\\", Eilish's signature logo, as well as Murakami's flowers. In March 2020, J Balvin released his album Colores featuring album cover designs and artwork by Takashi Murakami. The Murakami-designed artwork was carried over to merchandise to celebrate the release of his album. In April 2020, Supreme released a Box Logo Tee featuring artwork from Murakami. All the proceeds went to HELP USA, in order to support youth and families facing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic. =Market value= On November 11, 2003, ArtNews has described Murakami's work as being in great demand. Hiropon (1997), a life- sized, satirical sculpture of an anime character with gigantic lactating breasts whose milk stream forms a jump rope made of fiberglass, sold for $427,500 at Christie's auction house in May 2002. Miss ko2 (1996), a 6-foot- tall model of an anime-inspired blonde girl in a red and white maid outfit, was sold for $567,500 in 2003, and was put up for auction in 2010, where it sold for 22.9 million HKD. In May 2008, My Lonesome Cowboy (1998), an anime- inspired sculpture of a masturbating boy whose semen stream forms a lasso, sold for $15.2 million at Sotheby's. Murakami's current net-worth is estimated to be around US$100 million, and the value of his works continue to rise in today's market. =Current= From 2007 to 2009, Murakami's first retrospective ¬©Murakami traveled from the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) in Los Angeles (its multi-disciplinary approach to contemporary art), to the Brooklyn Museum of Art in New York, the Museum f√ºr Moderne Kunst in Frankfurt, and lastly the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, Spain. Sarah Thornton tracks the early stages of the exhibition's planning, including in-depth curatorial meetings between Murakami and prominent museum figures, in Seven Days in the Art World. The exhibition earned widespread attention for, among other things, including a fully functioning Louis Vuitton boutique as one of the exhibits. In 2008, Murakami was named one of Time magazine's \\"100 Most Influential People\\", the only visual artist included. In September 2010 Murakami became the third contemporary artist, and first Japanese, to exhibit at the Palace of Versailles in France, filling 15 rooms and the park with his sculptures, paintings, a decorative carpet, and lamps.Takashi Murakami at the Palace of Versailles Guardian.co.uk, September 10, 2010 In February 2012, Murakami opened an exhibition in Doha, Qatar. Titled Murakami-Ego, this showed around 60 old works alongside new ones designed especially for the exhibition. Among the new ones, a 100-metre long wall painting depicting the suffering of the Japanese people after the Fukushima nuclear disaster.Hundred-metre dash in the Economist, February 18, 2012 In March 2013, livetune released a PV, directed by Murakami, for Redial, featuring Hatsune Miku.livetune feat.

Jellyfish Eyes (originally titled \\"Me me me no kurage)Jellyfish Eyes Japanese website , June 23, 2013) is a live-action movie featuring CGI characters designed by Murakami called Friend.Jellyfish Eyes English website, June 23, 2013 Art style Murakami's art encompasses a wide range of media and is generally described as superflat. It has been noted for its use of color, incorporation of motifs from Japanese traditional and popular culture, flat/glossy surfaces, and content that could be described at once as \\"cute\\", \\"psychedelic\\", or \\"satirical\\". Among his best known recurring motifs are smiling flowers, iconic characters, mushrooms, skulls, Buddhist iconography, and the sexual complexes of otaku culture. One of Murakami's most famous pieces known as 'Hiropon' brings to light his love for otaku culture. The sculpture that was created in 2001 is said to show the \\"otaku culture and its strange, shocking sexuality in full force\\" and again like its counterpart 'The Lonesome Cowboy' semen rests floating around the female sculpture. In addition to large paintings such as 727 (permanent collection Museum of Modern Art, New York) and Tan Tan Bo Puking ‚Äì a.k.a. Gero Tan, he has also produced sculptures, balloons, 'all-over' wallpaper installations, animated works, prints, posters, and assorted merchandise. On June 21, 2011, Google featured a doodle tagged as \\"First Day of Summer\\" which was created by Murakami. This was accompanied by a Winter Solstice doodle for the Southern Hemisphere. Kaikai Kiki Murakami has incorporated his operations as Kaikai Kiki Co., Ltd. in Japan (2001), Kaikai Kiki New York, LLC in New York (2001), and Kaikai Kiki LA, LLC in Los Angeles (2010). Kaikai Kiki executes Murakami's wide range of artistic endeavors and consists of both offices and production studios. In addition to handling the production and promotion of Murakami's artwork and projects, the company manages the careers of young artists, organizes international art projects, produces and promotes merchandise, and handles the organization and operation of the Geisai art fair. Having earned success and recognition internationally, Murakami has devoted himself to nurturing and supporting the careers of a younger generation of Japanese artists. Likening the operation to that of a record label, he offers both logistic support and practical career advice. Through this endeavor, he also seeks to build an original and sustainable art market in Japan. In 2008, Kaikai Kiki converted the basement space beneath its Tokyo office into an art gallery. Kaikai Kiki Gallery has held exhibitions not only for the artists under its management but also international names such as Mark Grotjahn and Friedrich Kunath. All exhibitions are curated by Murakami. A second Gallery called Hidari Zingaro was opened in 2010 and has now expanded to include four separate locations within the Nakano Broadway shopping mall in Nakano, Tokyo. Geisai From 2002 until 2014, Murakami organized a unique direct-participatory art fair called Geisai. It was held once per year in Japan and once per year in a different city, such as Taipei, or Miami. Rather than give space to pre-screened galleries, the fair allowed artists to create their own booths and interact directly with potential buyers.

Szent Istv√°n was the only ship of her class to be built within the Hungarian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, a concession made to the Hungarian government in return for its support for the 1910 and 1911 naval budgets which funded the Tegetthoff class. She was built at the Ganz-Danubius shipyard in Fiume, where she was laid down in January 1912. She was launched two years later in 1914, but Szent Istv√°ns construction was delayed due to the smaller shipyards in Fiume, and further delayed by the outbreak of World War I in July 1914. She was finally commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in December 1915. Armed with a main battery of twelve guns in four triple turrets, Szent Istv√°n was assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the Austro-Hungarian Navy upon her commissioning. Alongside the other ships of her class, she was stationed out of the Austro-Hungarian naval base at Pola. Szent Istv√°ns commissioning into the fleet came too late for her to participate in the Bombardment of Ancona following Italy's declaration of war on Austria- Hungary in May 1915, and she saw little combat for the rest of the war due to the Otranto Barrage, which prevented the Austro-Hungarian Navy from leaving the Adriatic Sea. In June 1918, in a bid to ensure safer passage for German and Austro-Hungarian U-boats through the Strait of Otranto, the Austro- Hungarian Navy attempted to break the Barrage. This attack was to be spearheaded by all four ships of the Tegetthoff class but was abandoned after Szent Istv√°n and her sister ship, were attacked by Italian motor torpedo boats on the morning of 10 June. While Tegetthoff was unharmed, Szent Istv√°n was struck by two torpedoes launched from MAS-15, and capsized roughly three hours later off the island of Premuda. She is the only battleship whose sinking was filmed during World War I. The ship's wreck was located in the mid-1970s by the Yugoslav Navy. She lies upside down at a depth of . Her bow broke off when it hit the seabed while the stern was still afloat, but is immediately adjacent to the rest of the heavily encrusted hull. She is a protected site of the Croatian Ministry of Culture.  Background  Before the construction of Szent Istv√°n and the other three ships of the Tegetthoff class, most of Austria-Hungary's battleships had been designed for the defense of the Empire's coastline. During the 19th-century, sea power had not been a priority in Austrian foreign policy. As a result, the Austro-Hungarian Navy had little public interest or support. However, the appointment of Archduke Franz Ferdinand ‚Äì heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne and a prominent and influential supporter of naval expansion ‚Äì to the position of admiral in September 1902 greatly increased the importance of the Navy in the eyes of both the general public and the Austrian and Hungarian Parliaments. Franz Ferdinand's interest in naval affairs were largely motivated from his belief that a strong navy would be necessary to compete with Italy, which he viewed as Austria-Hungary's greatest regional threat. In 1904, the Austro-Hungarian Navy began an expansion program intended to equal that of the other Great Powers of Europe. This naval expansion program coincided with the establishment of the Austrian Naval League in September 1904 and the appointment of Vice-Admiral Rudolf Montecuccoli to the posts of Commander-in- Chief of the Navy (German: Marinekommandant) and Chief of the Naval Section of the War Ministry (German: Chef der Marinesektion) in October that same year. After Montecuccoli's appointment, the Admiral worked to pursue the efforts championed by his predecessor, Admiral Hermann von Spaun, and pushed for a greatly expanded and modernized navy. The origins of Szent Istv√°n and the Tegetthoff class can also be found in developments in the first decade of the 20th century which greatly increased the importance of sea power to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Between 1906 and 1907, railroads linking Trieste and the Dalmatian coastline to the interior of the Empire had been constructed through Austria's Alpine passes. Additionally, lower tariffs on the port of Trieste allowed for a rapid expansion of the city and a similar growth in Austria-Hungary's merchant marine. As Austria-Hungary became more connected to naval affairs than in past decades, a new line of battleships would be necessary to match the Empire's growing naval interests. Szent Istv√°n and her sister ships were first envisioned in the middle of a heated naval arms race between Austria-Hungary and its nominal ally, Italy. Since the Battle of Lissa in 1866, Italy's Regia Marina was considered the most-important naval power in the region which Austria-Hungary measured itself against, often unfavorably. The disparity between the Austro-Hungarian and Italian navies had existed since the unification of Italy; in the late 1880s Italy had the third-largest fleet in the world, behind the French Republic's Navy and the British Royal Navy. While the disparity between Italian and Austro-Hungarian naval strength had been somewhat equalized with the Russian Imperial Navy and the German Kaiserliche Marine surpassing the Italian Navy in 1893 and in 1894, Italy had once again regained the initiative by the turn of the century. In 1903, the year before Montecuccoli's appointment, Italy had 18 battleships in commission or under construction compared to 6 Austro-Hungarian battleships. Following the construction of the final two s in 1903, the Italian Navy elected to construct a series of large cruisers rather than additional battleships. Furthermore, a major scandal involving the Terni steel works' armor contracts led to a government investigation that postponed several naval construction programs for three years. These delays meant that the Italian Navy would not initiate construction of another battleship until 1909, and provided the Austro-Hungarian Navy an opportunity to even the disparity between the two fleets. The construction of Szent Istv√°n and her sister ships can thus be viewed in the context of the naval rivalry between Austria-Hungary and Italy, with the ship playing a role in a larger attempt by Austria-Hungary to compete with Italy's naval power. = Austro-Italian naval arms race = The revolution in naval technology created by the launch of the British in 1906 and the Anglo-German naval arms race that followed had a tremendous impact on the development of future battleships around the world, including Szent Istv√°n. Dreadnought, armed with ten large-caliber guns, was the first of a revolutionary new standard of \\"all-big-gun\\" battleships that rendered pre- dreadnought battleships obsolete. As a result, the value of older battleships declined rapidly in the years after 1906. This development gave Austria- Hungary the opportunity to make up for neglecting its navy in past years. Furthermore, Austria-Hungary's improved financial situation following the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 were beginning to reflect in the form of larger budgets being allocated to the Empire's armed forces. Political will also existed to construct Austria-Hungary's own dreadnought battleship, as both Archduke Ferdinand and Admiral Montecuccoli were supportive of constructing a new class of modern battleships. As a result, by 1908 the stage was set for the creation of Szent Istv√°n and the Tegetthoff class. Shortly after assuming command as Chief of the Navy, Montecuccoli drafted his first proposal for a modern Austrian fleet in the spring of 1905. While these plans were ambitious and included 12 battleships, none of the ships were near the eventual size of Szent Istv√°n. Additional proposals came from outside the Naval Section of the War Ministry. Two proposals from Slovenian politician Ivan ≈†uster≈°iƒç, and the Austrian Naval League in 1905 and 1909 included battleships which approached the size of Szent Istv√°n. While ≈†uster≈°iƒç's plan lacked the large-caliber guns that would later be found on Szent Istv√°n, the plans submitted by the Austrian Naval League three dreadnoughts of , similar to Szent Istv√°ns eventual displacement of . These plans were justified by the League by pointing out that newer battleships were necessary to protect Austria-Hungary's growing merchant marine, and that Italian naval spending was twice that of Austria-Hungary's. Following the construction of Austria- Hungary's last class of pre-dreadnought battleships, the , Montecuccoli submitted a proposal which would include the first design for Szent Istv√°n. With the threat of war with Italy from the Bosnian Crisis in 1908 fresh in the minds of the Austro-Hungarian military, Montecuccoli delivered a memorandum to Emperor Franz Joseph I in January 1909 proposing an enlarged Austro-Hungarian Navy consisting of 16 battleships, 12 cruisers, 24 destroyers, 72 seagoing torpedo boats, and 12 submarines. The most notable change in this memorandum compared to Monteccucoli's previous draft from 1905 was the inclusion of four additional dreadnought battleships with a displacement of at load. One of these ships would eventually become Szent Istv√°n.  Plans and budget  Montecuccoli's memorandum would eventually be leaked to Italian newspapers just three months after obtaining approval from Emperor Franz Joseph I. The Italian reaction to the Austro-Hungarian plans was swift, and in June 1909, the Italian dreadnought battleship was laid down at the naval shipyard in Castellammare di Stabia. While Dante Alighieri was being worked on in Italy, Austria-Hungary's own plans for Szent Istv√°n and the other ships of her class remained on paper. Funding necessary to begin construction was not to be had either, due to the collapse of S√°ndor Wekerle's government in Budapest. This left the Hungarian Diet without a prime minister for nearly a year. With no government in Budapest to pass a budget, the money necessary to pay for Szent Istv√°n could not be obtained. As a result, the largest shipbuilding enterprises in Austria-Hungary, the Witkowitz Ironworks and the ≈†koda Works, offered to begin construction on three Tegetthoff-class dreadnoughts at their own financial risk, in return for assurances that the Austro-Hungarian government would purchase the battleships as soon as funds were available. After negotiations which involved the Austro-Hungarian joint ministries of foreign affairs, war and finance, the offer was agreed to by Montecuccoli, but the number of dreadnoughts constructed under this arrangement was reduced to two. In his memoirs, former Austrian Field Marshal and Chief of the General Staff Conrad von H√∂tzendorf wrote that due to his belief that a war with Italy in the near future was likely, construction on the battleships should begin as soon as possible. He also worked to secure agreements to sell the ships to, in his words, a \\"reliable ally\\" (which only Germany could claim to be) should the budget crisis in Budapest fail to be settled quickly. =Outline= Although smaller than the contemporary dreadnought and super-dreadnought battleships of the German Kaiserliche Marine and the British Royal Navy, Szent Istv√°n was part of the first class of its type in the Mediterranean and Adriatic Seas. Szent Istv√°n and her sister ships were described by former Austro-Hungarian naval officer Anthony Sokol in his book The Imperial and Royal Austro- Hungarian Navy as \\"excellent ships\\", and she was acknowledged as one of the most powerful battleships in the region. The design of the battleship also signaled a change in Austro-Hungarian naval policy, as she was capable of far more than coastal defense or patrolling the Adriatic Sea. Indeed, Szent Istv√°n and her sister ships were so well received that when the time came to plan for the replacement of Austria-Hungary's old s, the navy elected to simply take the layout of her class and enlarge them to have a slightly greater tonnage and larger main guns. =Funding= The cost to construct Szent Istv√°n was enormous by the standards of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. While the , , and the Radetzky-class battleships cost the navy roughly 18, 26, and 40 million krone per ship, Szent Istv√°n was projected to cost over 60 million krone. Under the previous budgets for 1907 and 1908, the navy had been allocated some 63.4 and 73.4 million krone, which at the time was considered an inflated budget due to the construction of two Radetzkys. Montecuccoli worried that the general public and the legislatures in Vienna and Budapest would reject the need for a ship as expensive as Szent Istv√°n, especially so soon after the political crisis in Budapest. The dramatic increase in spending meant that in 1909 the navy spent some 100.4 million krone, a huge sum at the time. This was done in order to rush the completion of the Radetzky-class battleships, though the looming construction of three other dreadnoughts in addition to Szent Istv√°n meant the Austro-Hungarian Navy would likely have to ask the government for a yearly budget much higher than 100 million krone. A secret agreement to fund construction of Viribus Unitis and Tegetthoff, Szent Istv√°ns sister ships, was struck with the Rothschild family in Austria, who owned the Witkowitz Ironworks, the Creditanstalt Bank, and had significant assets in both the ≈†koda Works and the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino. Archduke Franz Ferdinand personally courted Albert Salomon Anselm von Rothschild to obtain his family's monetary support until the government could buy Szent Istv√°ns two older sister ships. Facing potential backlash over constitutional concerns that constructing two Tegetthoff-class battleships committed Austria-Hungary to spend roughly 120 million Krone without prior approval by either the Austrian Reichsrat or the Diet of Hungary, the deal remained secret. The agreement was ultimately leaked to the public in April 1910 by the Arbeiter-Zeitung, the newspaper of Austria's Social Democratic Party. However, by the time the Arbeiter-Zeitung broke the story, the plans had already been finalized on the Tegetthoff-class battleship and construction on two of Szent Istv√°ns sister ships was about to begin.  General characteristics  Designed by naval architect Siegfried Popper, Szent Istv√°n had an overall length of , with a beam of and a draught of at deep load. She was designed to displace at load, but at full combat load she displaced . Szent Istv√°ns hull was built with a double bottom, deep, with a reinforced inner bottom that consisted of two layers of plates. The hull design was intended by Popper to protect the battleship from naval mines, though it ultimately failed Szent Istv√°n when she was sunk by a torpedo in June 1918. The hull also failed for her sister ship Viribus Unitis when she was sunk by a mine in November of that same year. Szent Istv√°n also featured two Barr and Stroud optical rangefinder posts on both the starboard and port sides for the secondary guns of the battleship. These rangefinders were equipped with an armored cupola, which housed an Schwarzlose M.07/12 anti-aircraft machine gun. Unlike her sister ships, Szent Istv√°n was not equipped with torpedo nets. = Propulsion = Szent Istv√°n possessed two shafts and two AEG-Curtis steam turbines, which were housed in a separate engine-room and powered by twelve Babcock & Wilcox boilers. This differed from the four shaft arrangement present on her three sister ships. Szent Istv√°ns propulsion system was designed to produce a total of , which was theoretically enough to attain a maximum designed speed of . It was reported during the speed trials of her sister ship Tegetthoff that she attained a top speed of , though Szent Istv√°ns actual top speed is unknown as the official sea trial data and records for all ships of the Tegetthoff class were lost after the war. Szent Istv√°n also carried of coal, and an additional of fuel oil that was to be sprayed on the coal to increase its burn rate. At full capacity, Szent Istv√°n could steam for at a speed of . = Armament = alt=A diagram showing the location of the main guns on a Tegetthoff-class battleship. There are 12 guns in total divided into four turrets, with two apiece located near the bow and stern of the ship. Constructed at the ≈†koda Works in Plze≈à, Bohemia, Szent Istv√°ns main battery was one of the few pieces of the battleship to be built outside of Hungary. These guns consisted of twelve 45-calibre ≈†koda K10 guns mounted in four triple turrets. Two turrets each were mounted forward and aft of the ship's main superstructure in a superfiring pair. The implementation of triple turrets aboard Szent Istv√°n came about for two reasons: the need to ensure the ship had a more-compact design and smaller displacement to conform to Austro-Hungarian naval doctrine and budget constraints, and to counter the implementation of triple turrets on the Italian Dante Alighieri. Having three guns on each turret rather than two made it possible to deliver a heavier broadside than other dreadnoughts of a similar size and meant a shorter citadel and better weight distribution. Szent Istv√°n carried a secondary armament which consisted of a dozen 50-calibre ≈†koda K10 guns mounted in casemates amidships. Additionally, eighteen 50-calibre ≈†koda K10 guns were mounted on open pivot mounts on the upper deck, above the casemates. Three more ≈†koda K10 guns were mounted on the upper turrets for anti-aircraft duties. Two additional Schwarzlose M.07/12 anti- aircraft machine guns were mounted atop the armored cupolas of her rangefinders. Szent Istv√°n was also equipped with two ≈†koda G. L/18 landing guns, and two ≈†koda SFK L/44 S guns for use against small and fast vessels such as torpedo boats and submarines. Furthermore, she also fitted with four submerged torpedo tubes, one each in the bow, the stern, and each side. Complementing these torpedo tubes, Szent Istv√°n usually carried twelve torpedoes. = Armor = Szent Istv√°n was protected at the waterline with an armor belt which measured thick in the central citadel, where the most- important parts of the ship were located. This armor belt was located between the midpoints of the fore and aft barbettes, and thinned to further towards the bow and stern, but did not reach either. It was continued to the bow by a small patch of armor. The upper armor belt had a maximum thickness of , but it thinned to from the forward barbette all the way to the bow. The casemate armor was also thick. The sides of the main gun turrets, barbettes, and main conning tower were protected by of armor, except for the turret and conning tower roofs which were thick. The thickness of the decks ranged from in two layers. The underwater protection system consisted of the extension of the double-bottom upwards to the lower edge of the waterline armor belt, with a thin plate acting as the outermost bulkhead. It was backed by a torpedo bulkhead that consisted of two 25-millimetre plates. The total thickness of this system was only which made Szent Istv√°n incapable of containing a torpedo warhead detonation or mine explosion without rupturing. This design flaw would ultimately prove to be fatal for her and her sister ship Viribus Unitis.  Construction  Film about the construction of Szent Istv√°n in the Ganz- Danubius shipyard in Fiume in 1912 Montecuccoli's plans for the construction of Szent Istv√°n and her sister ships earned the approval of Emperor Franz Joseph I in January 1909, and by April plans for the design, construction, and financing for the battleships had been laid out. For a full year, the Austro- Hungarian Navy attempted to keep the looming construction of the first two battleships a state secret. This did not prevent rumors from circulating across Europe of two dreadnought battleships being constructed in Austria- Hungary. The French Naval Attach√© in Vienna complained to Paris in 1910 of extensive secrecy within the Austro-Hungarian Navy, which manifested itself in several ways. Among these were a ban on photography in the Pola, future home port of Szent Istv√°n, and near-constant observation by the Austro-Hungarian police. The Admiralty considered the rumored construction of the battleships \\"as a concealed addition to the German fleet\\", and interpreted the ships as Austria-Hungary's way of repaying Germany for her diplomatic support during the former's annexation of Bosnia in 1908. During the spring and summer of 1909, the United Kingdom was locked in a heated naval arms race with Germany which led the Royal Navy to look upon the battleship as a ploy by German Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz to outpace British naval construction, rather than the latest development in Austria-Hungary's own naval arms race with Italy. The Admiralty's concerns regarding the true purpose of the Tegetthoff class was so great that a British spy was dispatched to Berlin when Montecuccoli sent an officer from the Naval Section of the War Ministry to obtain recommendations from Tirpitz regarding the design and layout of the battleship. These concerns continued to grow and in April 1909, British Ambassador Fairfax Leighton Cartwright asked Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal about the rumored battleships. Aehrenthal denied the construction of any dreadnoughts, but admitted that plans to construct a new battleship class were being considered. In an attempt to assure Cartwright that Austria-Hungary was not constructing any ships for the German Navy, Aehrenthal justified any naval expansion as being necessary to secure Austria- Hungary's strategic interests in the Mediterranean. At the time, the potential that Austria-Hungary was constructing a class of dreadnought battleships was widely regarded among the British press, public, and politicians as a provocation on the part of Germany. Neither the Admiralty's suspicions, nor those of some politicians, managed to convince Parliament that the German government was attempting to use the battleships to escalate Germany and Britain's already contentious naval arms race however. When Winston Churchill was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty in 1911, he rejected any potential Austro-German collusion regarding the battleship. Roughly a year after Szent Istv√°ns plans were drafted, Arbeiter-Zeitung, the Austrian Social Democratic Party newspaper, reported the details of the battleship to the general public. The Christian Social Party, supportive of the construction of Szent Istv√°n and her sister ships, and operating on the advice of the navy, published in its own newspaper, Reichspost, that the secret project to construct the battleship and the related financial agreements to fund it were true. The Reichpost lobbied in support of the project, citing Austria-Hungary's national security concerns with an Italian dreadnought already under construction. When the story broke, Archduke Ferdinand also worked to build public support for the construction of the battleships, and the Austrian Naval League did the same.{{sfnSondhaus1994p=194} = Assembly and commissioning = 1st part: The launching of the nearly-finished Szent Istv√°n, 2nd part: video about the test of the battleship Szent Istv√°n would be the fourth and last ship of her class, was laid down in Fiume by Ganz-Danubius on 29 January 1912. Fiume was the only large Hungarian shipyard in Croatia. Ganz-Danubius had been awarded the contract to build the battleship in return for the Hungarian government agreeing to the 1910 and 1911 naval budgets which funded the Tegetthoff class. However, this contract involved great expense by the Hungarian government, as Fiume had hitherto only built smaller merchant ships for merchant firms such as the Austrian Lloyd. The shipyards in the city therefore had to be themselves refitted and enlarged for the building of a vessel as large as Szent Istv√°n. The final package of the budget agreement which funded Szent Istv√°n included provisions which ensured that while the armor and guns of the battleship were to be constructed within Austria, the electrical wiring and equipment aboard Szent Istv√°n was to be assembled in Hungary. Additionally, half of all ammunition and shells for the guns of the ship would be purchased in Austria, while the other half was to be bought in Hungary. Construction on Szent Istv√°n was delayed by the size of Fiume's shipyards and as a result, she was not launched until 17 January 1912. It was customary for either the Emperor or his heir to be present at the launching of a major warship, but Emperor Franz Joseph I was too feeble and his heir, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, refused to be there as a consequence of his anti-Hungarian attitudes. Franz Joseph I thus sent a telegram of congratulations which negated the snub offered by his heir. During the launching itself there was an accident when the starboard anchor had to be dropped to prevent the ship from hitting a ship carrying spectators, but the anchor chain had not been shackled to the ship and it struck two dockworkers, killing one and crushing the arm of the other. Originally referred to as \\"Battleship VII\\", discussion began over what to name the battleship while it was under construction in Trieste. The Naval Section of the War Ministry initially proposed naming the battleship Hunyadi. Newspapers within Austria reported during construction that one of the ships was to be named Kaiser Franz Joseph I, though it was later revealed the navy had no intentions of renaming the cruiser which already bore the Emperor's name. Archduke Franz Ferdinand proposed Laudon for the ship in honor of the Austrian field marshall. Emperor Franz Joseph I ultimately decided to name her Szent Istv√°n, after the 11th-century saint Stephen I, the first King of Hungary.  Career  Film about the artillery exercises of Szent Istv√°n in 1915 Following France and Britain's declarations of war on Austria-Hungary on 11 and 12 August 1914 respectively, the French Admiral Augustin Bou√© de Lapeyr√®re was issued orders to close off Austro-Hungarian shipping at the entrance to the Adriatic Sea and to engage any Austro-Hungarian ships his Anglo-French fleet came across. Lapeyr√®re chose to attack the Austro-Hungarian ships blockading Montenegro. The ensuing Battle of Antivari ended Austria- Hungary's blockade, and effectively placed the entrance of the Adriatic Sea firmly in the hands of Britain and France. Following her launching, Szent Istv√°n underwent sea trials before preparing to be commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the autumn of 1915. Szent Istv√°ns war logs record that on 18 November 1915, the battleship fired the first trial shots of her guns. Gunnery trials continued the following day and on 20 November, she underwent machinery trials in the Fasana Channel. These machinery trials continued on 22 November, where it was reported that Szent Istv√°n had attained an unofficial speed of . That same day, the battleship conducted torpedo launches from her four torpedo tubes, before anchoring at Fasana for the night. She returned to her home port of Pola on 25 November. Between 13 and 23 December, Szent Istv√°n conducted further gunnery trials before finally being commissioned into the 1st Battleship Division of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. = 1916 = alt=A two-funneled ship steams through a harbor with smoke billowing Like the other three ships of theTegetthoff class, Szent Istv√°n saw very little action during the course of the war, spending much of her time at her base at Pola. This general inactivity was partly caused by a fear of mines in the Adriatic. Grand Admiral Anton Johann Haus chose to keep most of his ships in port in order to use the Austro-Hungarian Navy as a fleet in being. This tactic earned sharp criticism from the Austro-Hungarian Army, the German Navy, and the Austro-Hungarian Foreign Ministry, but it also led to a far greater number of Entente naval forces being devoted to the Mediterranean and the Strait of Otranto. These could have been used elsewhere, such as against the Ottoman Empire during the Gallipoli Campaign. The most-important factor contributing to Szent Istv√°n spending most of her time at port may have been the lack of coal. Prior to the war, the United Kingdom had served as Austria- Hungary's primary source for coal. In the years before the war an increasing percentage of coal had come from mines in Germany, Virginia, and from domestic sources, but 75% of the coal purchased for the Austro-Hungarian Navy came from Britain. The outbreak of war meant that these sources, as well as those from Virginia, would no longer be available. Significant quantities of coal had been stockpiled before the war however, ensuring the Navy was capable of sailing out of port if need be. Even so, the necessity of ensuring the Navy's most-important ships such as Szent Istv√°n had the coal she needed in the event of an Italian or French attack or a major offensive operation resulted in the dreadnoughts remaining at port unless circumstances necessitated their deployment at sea. Commissioning into the Austro-Hungarian Navy too late to engage in the Bombardment of Ancona, Szent Istv√°n was mostly relegated to defending Austria-Hungary's coastline and of island seaboard for the next three years. The lack of combat engagements, or even instances where Szent Istv√°n left port, is exemplified by war logs. Between 1916 and 1918, the battleship rarely left the safety of the port except for gunnery practice in the nearby Fasana Strait. She only spent 54 days at sea during her 937 days in service and made only a single two-day trip to Pag Island. In total, only 5.7% of her life was spent at sea; and for the rest of the time she swung at anchor in Pola Harbour. Szent Istv√°n saw so little action and so little time at sea that she was never drydocked to have her bottom cleaned. =1917= In January 1917 Emperor Karl I attended a military conference at Schloss Pless with German Kaiser Wilhelm II and members of the German Army and Navy. Haus, along with members of Austria-Hungary's naval command at Pola, accompanied the Emperor to this conference in order to discuss naval operations in the Adriatic and Mediterranean for 1917. Days after returning from this conference, Grand Admiral Haus died of pneumonia aboard his flagship Viribus Unitis on 8 February 1917. Newly crowned Emperor Karl I attended his funeral in Pola. Despite his death, Haus' strategy of keeping the Austro-Hungarian Navy, and particularly its dreadnoughts, in port continued. By keeping Szent Istv√°n and the Tegetthoff class battleships as a fleet in being, the Austro- Hungarian Navy would be able to continue to defend its lengthy coastline from naval bombardment or invasion by sea. The major ports of Trieste and Fiume would also remain protected. Furthermore, Italian ships stationed in Venice were effectively trapped by the positioning of the Austro-Hungarian fleet, preventing them from sailing south to join the bulk of the Entente forces at the Otranto Barrage. Maximilian Njegovan was promoted to admiral and appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. With Njegovan appointed to higher office, command of the First Battle Division, which comprised all four Tegetthoff- class ships, fell to Vice-Admiral Anton Willenik. Njegovan had previously voiced frustration watching the dreadnoughts he had commanded under Haus sit idle at port and upon taking command he had some 400,000 tons of coal at his disposal, but he chose to continue the strategy of his predecessor. Despite a change in command of both the Austro-Hungarian Navy and the Empire which it served, there would be no change in strategy regarding the employment of the Tegetthoff class in battle. Having hardly ever ventured out of port except to conduct gunnery practice for the past two years, the most-significant moments Szent Istv√°n saw while moored in Pola were inspections by dignitaries. The first such visit was conducted by Emperor Karl I on 15 December 1916. During this brief visit the Emperor inspected Pola's naval establishments and boarded Szent Istv√°n. Karl I returned to Pola in June 1917 in the first formal imperial review of the Austro-Hungarian Navy since 1902. This visit was far grander than his previous trip to the naval base, with officers and sailors crowding the decks of their ships at port and the naval ensign of Austria- Hungary flying from every vessel. The Emperor received multiple cheers and salutes from the men at Pola, who had spent the past two years doing little more than shooting down Italian airplanes and airships. The third dignitary visit came during Kaiser Wilhelm II's inspection of Pola's German submarine base on 12 December 1917. During this trip, the German Emperor also took the time to inspect Szent Istv√°n in similar fashion to his Austro-Hungarian counterpart. Aside from these visits, the only action the port of Pola and Szent Istv√°n were subject to between the Bombardment of Ancona and the summer of 1918 were the more than eighty air raids conducted by the newly formed Italian Air Force. =1918 = upright=1 Following the Cattaro Mutiny in February 1918, Admiral Njegovan was fired as Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, though at Njegovan's request it was announced that he was retiring. Mikl√≥s Horthy de Nagyb√°nya, commander of Szent Istv√°ns sister ship Prinz Eugen, was promoted to rear admiral and named Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet. Horthy's promotion was met with support among many members of the naval officer corps, who believed he would use Austria-Hungary's navy to engage the enemy. Horthy's appointment did however pose difficulties. His relatively young age alienated many of the senior officers, and Austria-Hungary's naval traditions included an unspoken rule that no officer could serve at sea under someone of inferior seniority. This meant that the heads of the First and Second Battle Squadrons, as well as the Cruiser Flotilla, all had to go into early retirement. Horthy also used his appointment to take the Austro-Hungarian fleet out of port for maneuvers and gunnery practice on a regular basis. The size of these operations were the largest Szent Istv√°n had ever participated in at the time, and they were the largest the Austro-Hungarian Navy had seen since the outbreak of the war. These gunnery and maneuver practices were conducted not only to restore order in the wake of several failed mutinies, but also to prepare the fleet for a major offensive operation. Horthy's strategic thinking differed from his two predecessors, and shortly after assuming command of the navy he resolved to undertake a major fleet action in order to address low morale and boredom, and make it easier for Austro-Hungarian and German U-boats to break out of the Adriatic into the Mediterranean. After several months of practice, Horthy concluded the fleet was ready for a major offensive at the beginning of June 1918.  Otranto Raid  alt=A battleship leaning heavily to the right, about to capsize Horthy was determined to use the fleet to attack the Otranto Barrage. Planning to repeat his successful raid on the blockade in May 1917, Horthy envisioned a massive attack on the Allied forces with Szent Istv√°n and the other three Tegetthoff class ships providing the largest component of the assault. They would be accompanied by the three ships of the Erzherzog Karl-class pre-dreadnoughts, the three s, the cruiser Admiral Spaun, four s, and four torpedo boats. Submarines and aircraft would also be employed in the operation to hunt down enemy ships on the flanks of the fleet. On 8 June 1918 Horthy took his flagship, Viribus Unitis, and Prinz Eugen south with the lead elements of his fleet. On the evening of 9 June, Szent Istv√°n and Tegetthoff followed along with their own escort ships. Horthy's plan called for and to engage the Barrage with the support of the T√°tra-class destroyers. Meanwhile, Admiral Spaun and would be escorted by the fleet's four torpedo boats to Otranto to bombard Italian air and naval stations. The German and Austro-Hungarian submarines would be sent to Valona and Brindisi to ambush Italian, French, British, and American warships that sailed out to engage the Austro-Hungarian fleet, while seaplanes from Cattaro would provide air support and screen the ships' advance. The battleships, and in particular Szent Istv√°n and the other Tegetthoffs, would use their firepower to destroy the Barrage and engage any Allied warships they ran across. Horthy hoped that the inclusion of these ships would prove to be critical in securing a decisive victory. En route to the harbour at Islana, north of Ragusa, to rendezvous with Viribus Unitis and Prinz Eugen for the coordinated attack on the Otranto Barrage, Szent Istv√°n and Tegetthoff attempted to make maximum speed in order to catch up to the rest of the fleet. In doing so, Szent Istv√°ns turbines started to overheat and speed had to be reduced to . When an attempt was made to raise more steam in order to increase to Szent Istv√°n produced an excess of smoke. At about 3:15 am on 10 June, two Italian MAS boats, MAS-15 and MAS-21, spotted the smoke from the Austrian ships while returning from an uneventful patrol off the Dalmatian coast. The MAS unit was commanded by Capitano di corvetta Luigi Rizzo, who had sunk the Austro-Hungarian coastal defense ship in Trieste six months before. The individual boats were commanded by Capo timoniere Armando Gori and Guardiamarina di complemento Giuseppe Aonzo respectively. Both boats successfully penetrated the escort screen and split to engage each of the dreadnoughts. MAS-21 attacked Tegetthoff, but her torpedoes failed to hit the ship. MAS-15 fired her two torpedoes successfully at 3:25 am at Szent Istv√°n. Both boats evaded any pursuit although MAS-15 had to discourage the Austro-Hungarian torpedo boat Tb 76 T by dropping depth charges in her wake. Tegetthoff, thinking that the torpedoes were fired by submarines, pulled out of the formation and started to zigzag to throw off any further attacks. She repeatedly fired on suspected submarine periscopes. alt=A large battleship lists in the water as the crew evacuates the vessel before it capsizes. Szent Istv√°n was hit by two torpedoes abreast her boiler rooms. The aft boiler room quickly flooded and gave the ship a 10¬∞ list to starboard. Counterflooding of the portside trim cells and magazines reduced the list to 7¬∞, but efforts to use collision mats to plug the holes failed. While this was going on the dreadnought steered for the nearby Bay of Brgulje at low speed. However, water continued to leak into the forward boiler room and eventually doused all but the two boilers on the port side. This killed the power for the pumps and only left enough electricity to run the lights. The turrets were trained to port in a futile effort to counter the list and their ready ammunition was thrown overboard. Upon returning to the formation at 4:45 am, Tegetthoff attempted to take Szent Istv√°n in tow, which failed. Many of the crew members of the sinking battleship assembled on the deck to use their weight along with the turned turrets as a counterbalance, but the ship was taking on too much water. Szent Istv√°ns chaplain performed one final blessing while the crew of Tegetthoff emerged onto her decks to salute the sinking ship. At 6:12 am, with the pumps unequal to the task, Szent Istv√°n capsized off Premuda. 89 sailors and officers died in the sinking, 41 of them from Hungary. The low death toll can be partly attributed to the long amount of time it took for the battleship to sink, and the fact that all sailors with the Austro-Hungarian Navy had to learn to swim before entering active service. The captain of Szent Istv√°n, Heinrich Seitz, was prepared to go down with his ship but was saved after being thrown off the bridge when she capsized. Film footage and photographs exist of Szent Istv√°ns last half-hour, taken by Linienschiffsleutnant Meusburger of Tegetthoff with his own camera and by an official film crew. The two films were later spliced together and exhibited in the United States after the war. The battleship's sinking was one of only two on the high seas to ever be filmed, the other being that of the British battleship during World War II. Proceeds from the film of Szent Istv√°n capsizing were eventually used to feed children in Austria following the ending of the war. Fearing further attacks by torpedo boats or destroyers from the Italian navy, and possible Allied dreadnoughts responding to the scene, Horthy believed the element of surprise had been lost and called off the attack. In reality, the Italian torpedo boats had been on a routine patrol, and Horthy's plan had not been betrayed to the Italians as he had feared. The Italians did not even discover that the Austrian dreadnoughts had departed from Pola until 10 June when aerial reconnaissance photos revealed that they were no longer there. Nevertheless, the loss of Szent Istv√°n and the blow to morale it had on the navy forced Horthy to cancel his plans to assault the Otranto Barrage. The fleet returned to the base at Pola where it would remain for the rest of the war. = Legacy = After the war MAS-15 was installed in the Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II as part of the Museo del Risorgimento in Rome for the torpedo boat's role in the sinking of Szent Istv√°n. The anniversary of the sinking, 10 June, has been celebrated by the Regia Marina, and its successor, the Marina Militare, as the official Italian Navy Day (). The wreck of Szent Istv√°n was located in the mid-1970s by the Yugoslav Navy. She lies upside down at a depth of . Her bow broke off when it hit the seabed while the stern was still afloat, but is immediately adjacent to the rest of the heavily encrusted hull. The two holes from the torpedo hits are visible in the side of the ship as is another deep hole which may be from a torpedo fired at Tegetthoff by MAS 21. The wreck is a protected site of the Croatian Ministry of Culture.  Consequences  Konteradmiral Horthy cancelled the attack because he thought that the Italians had discovered his plan and ordered the ships to return to Pola. In fact the Italians did not even discover that the Austrian dreadnoughts had departed Pola until later on 10 June when aerial reconnaissance photos revealed that they were no longer there. Capitano di fregata Luigi Rizzo was awarded his second Gold Medal of Military Valor; his first was for sinking the pre-dreadnought battleship Wien in 1917, and appointed a knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy. After the war MAS 15 was installed in the Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II as part of the Museo del Risorgimento in Rome. The anniversary of the sinking has been celebrated by the Regia Marina, and its successor, the Marina Militare, as its Navy Day ().

It is known for its intellectual, liberal, artistic, musical and literary associations. It is an example of early twentieth-century domestic architecture and town planning in the London Borough of Barnet, northwest London. The master plan was prepared by Barry Parker and Sir Raymond Unwin. Comprising just over 5,000 properties, and home to around 13,000 people, undivided houses with individual gardens are a key feature. The area enjoys landscaped garden squares, several communal parks and Hampstead Heath Extension. History Hampstead Garden Suburb was founded by Henrietta Barnett, who, with her husband Samuel, had started the Whitechapel Art Gallery and Toynbee Hall. In 1906, Barnett set up the Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust Ltd, which purchased 243 acres of land from Eton College for the scheme and appointed Raymond Unwin as its architect. Among the scheme's aims were the following: * It should cater for all classes of people and all income groups * There should be a low housing density * Roads should be wide and tree-lined * Houses should be separated by hedges, not walls * Woods and public gardens should be free to all * It should be quiet, with no church bells This required a private bill before Parliament, as it was counter to local bylaws. The provisions of the new act, Hampstead Garden Suburb Act 1906, allowed less land to be taken up by roads and more by gardens and open spaces. The ideas for the \\"Garden Suburb\\" were clearly based on the ideas and experience of Parker and Unwin in the planning and development of Letchworth Garden City, the first development of its kind, inspired by the work of Ebenezer Howard. Other consultant architects involved with the Hampstead development include George Lister Sutcliffe and John Soutar. However, with no industry, no public houses and few shops or services, the suburb, unlike the garden cities, made no attempt to be self-contained. In the 1930s the \\"Suburb\\" (as it is known by locals) expanded to the north of the A1. While more characterful than most other suburban housing, some of the housing to the north is considered, overall, of less architectural value. On Central Square, laid out by Sir Edwin Lutyens, there are two large churches, St. Jude's Church and The Free Church, as well as a Quaker Meeting House. There are two mixed state primary schools in the Suburb, Garden Suburb and Brookland. There is also a state girls' grammar school, Henrietta Barnett School. The school used to house The Institute, an adult education centre, but The Institute moved first to East Finchley, then to Kingsbury and is currently in the process of closing down altogether. Shops and other services are provided in the shopping parade of Market Place. Shopping areas adjacent to the suburb include Temple Fortune, Golders Green and East Finchley. Little Wood contains an open-air arena, which is used for summer theatrical performances by a local amateur theatre society. Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust Freehold houses, flats and commercial premises within the Suburb are subject to a scheme of management approved pursuant to the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 by an Order of the Chancery Division of the High Court, dated 17 January 1974, as amended by a further Order dated 17 February 1983. The HGS Trust maintains the character and amenity of the Suburb and is responsible for implementing the management scheme. It has offices in Finchley Road. Freeholders are required to get the prior approval of the Trust before altering the external appearance of their properties. Consent is also required for significant changes to gardens, erection of garden sheds and felling or pruning of trees. The Trust is also the freeholder of the majority of the remaining leasehold property in the Suburb which are mostly held on very long leases. Hampstead Garden Suburb Act 1906 Urban town planning had been restricted by the byelaws established after the 1875 Housing Act, which had de facto called for a grid iron street layout, and a minimum housing density. This had prevented Cadbury building workers houses within a city, and caused Rowntree to build his housing in rural parishes. For Unwin to design a street structure that followed the contours, and built houses in cul-de-sacs a parliamentary act was needed. The Hampstead Garden Suburb Trust sponsored a private bill. The three relevant sections of the Act were ; Section 2:\\"There shall not be built in the Garden Suburb on the average throughout a greater proportion of houses to the acre than eight\\". :\\"On every road in the Garden Suburb (whatever the width of the said road) there shall be between any two houses standing on opposite sides of the road a space not less than fifty feet free of any buildings except walls, fences or gates.\\" ; Section 3:\\"With respect to any gardens, recreation grounds or open spaces provided by the Company for the common use of the inhabitants of any dwellings in the Garden Suburb the Company may make bye-laws for the regulation thereof....\\" ; Section 5:\\"Any road not exceeding 500 feet in length constructed primarily for the purpose of giving access to a group of houses in the Garden Suburb and not designed for the purposes of through traffic (known as an accommodation road), may with the consent of the local authority be exempted from any operation of any bye-laws of the local authority relating to the width of new streets and footways.\\" Section 2, defined a low building density, and wide streets with gardens or verges where trees could be planted. Section 5 distinguished between through-roads and accommodation roads, residential cul-de-sacs under . It recognised the difference between cul-de- sac roads of limited length and other roads, and allowed the suspension of certain the operation of local planning bye-laws Geography Parks and nature reserves The Suburb has large areas of open space, including Central Square; Hampstead Heath Extension; Northway Gardens; Lyttelton Playing Fields; and Big Wood and Little Wood. The southern end is close to Golders Hill Park. Local Politics Hampstead Garden Suburb is represented by three Councillors on Barnet Council. The Member of Parliament for the constituency is Mike Freer, who has represented the seat for the Conservative Party since 2010.

The abbey was founded in the 11th century by King Cnut's thegn Orc and his wife Tola, who handsomely endowed the monastery with lands in the area. The abbey prospered and became a local centre of power, controlling eight manor houses and villages. During the later Middle Ages, the abbey suffered much misfortune. In the time of the dissolution of the monasteries, the last abbot surrendered the abbey and the site became the property of Sir Giles Strangways. Today, a small part of the former Abbey estate, including the abbey's remains, and those of the nearby St Catherine's Chapel, are in the guardianship of English Heritage. Foundation The first reference to the site of Abbotsbury may be in a charter of King Edmund (r. 939‚Äì946) recording a grant of five hides of land at Abbedesburi to the thegn Sigewulf.Keynes, \\"The lost cartulary of Abbotsbury\\", p. 207. The name (Abbedesburi) may suggest that the land had once belonged to an abbot. During the reign of King Cnut (r. 1016‚Äì1035), the Scandinavian thegn Orc (also Urki, Urk) and his wife Tola took up residence in the area, having been granted land at Portesham.Keynes, \\"The lost cartulary of Abbotsbury\\", p. 208. Edward the Confessor (r. 1042‚Äì1066) also granted him Wootton and it was early in his reign that the couple founded a monastery at Abbotsbury, previously the site of a minor church. Orc and Tola, who had no children, enriched the monastery with a substantial amount of land, some of which was bequeathed after their deaths. By the time of the Domesday survey, Abbotsbury (itself worth 21 hides) was recorded to have held more than 65 hides of land TRE.Keynes, \\"The lost cartulary of Abbotsbury\\", p. 209. Orc also established his own guild, which according to the extant statutes, had its hall at Abbotsbury and protected the minster's interests.Dorothy Whitelock, English Historical Documents, no. 139. Last Period and Dissolution During the 14th century the Black Death killed many villagers and also the abbot. Moreover, the village was repeatedly attacked from the sea, reducing the security of the abbey and its status. In addition, the area suffered depradations from the forces sent to man the coastal defences. Later that century and in the century following the Abbey's situation had started to improve somewhat, and this gave rise to a good deal of building on the site, but then came the greatest disaster. In 1535 and 15391538 Henry VIII undertook the forcible Dissolution of the Monasteries. Under the last Abbot of Abbotsbury, Roger Roddon, the Abbey was dissolved in 1539, following a visit from the notorious Dr. Thomas Legh (Leigh, Lee). 'Houses of Benedictine monks: The abbey of Abbotsbury', in William Page (ed.), A History of the County of Dorset: Volume 2, London, 1908, pp. 48-53. British History Online http://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/dorset/vol2/pp48-53 [accessed 22 September 2020]. Legh's were never courtesy calls and the experience is unlikely to have been pleasant for the Abbotsbury community. A highly qualified lawyer, he was also a career diplomat, a former English ambassador to several European sovereigns. In visiting monasteries, he was always accompanied by fourteen men in livery and by his brother, all of whom had to be rewarded, no one less so than Legh himself. There was no end complaints about his harshness and insolence to the monks throughout the country. Cf. M.L. Robertson, Cromwell‚Äôs servants (Univ. California Los Angeles Ph.D. thesis, 1975), pp. 203-5, 518. Upon the surrender of the abbey, on 12 March 1539, Abbot Roger Roddon, along with the prior and eight brethren received pensions: the abbot, ¬£80; the prior, Thomas Bradford, ¬£9; Thomas Tolpuddle, ¬£7; six other brethren, including William Grey and John Vynsant, ¬£6 to ¬£5 each; Thomas Holnest, 40s.

Their loss was the gain of Sir Giles Strangwayshttps://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/dorset/vol2/pp48-53 (died 1546), the commissioner who had dissolved the monastery and who bought the abbey buildings, manor houses, water mills and Abbotsbury Swannery and much of the abbey's land for ¬£1,906, 10s (equivalent to ¬£ in ). The mentality of the time is perhaps difficult to fully understand. On the one hand Strangways' own father had in fact been buried in the Abbey which he despoiled, and when he himself died in 1546 his will bequeathed ¬£6 13s.4d. a year for two years for a priest to say Mass for the repose of his soul and the souls of his wife and son.http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/member/strangways- sir-giles-i-1486-1546#footnote8_rohmb6j [retrieved 22 September 2020]. Much of the land still belongs to Strangways' descendants, the Earls of Ilchester. Remains The abbey barn As was customary in such cases, Abbotsbury Abbey was largely demolished to maximize profit from the sale and to allow its stone to be reused. The 14th century Great Barn, which at 272 ft by 31 ft is reputedly the largest thatched tithe barn in the world, was spared. Though now only half roofed, the still impressive structure has two porches, each surmounted by a watching chamber. Also spared from the general destruction was St Catherine's Chapel, used at one time as a lookout across the sea and conversely as a landmark for mariners. Both are currently Grade I listed buildings and scheduled monuments. In the churchyard to the south of the present parish church, traces of the old abbey church can be found. A further survivor is part of the end wall of what may possible have been part of the abbot‚Äôs lodging, where two fireplaces can be seen. Other ruins visible on the site may have formed part of the guesthouse customary in monasteries. Often simple in style, these nevertheless offered much sought after safe shelter for travellers. Not far away, the Abbey's former swannery has become part of an internationally famous nature reserve.

It was developed as a dedicated export version of the PZL P.11, a gull wing all-metal fighter designed by Polish aeronautical engineer Zygmunt Pu≈Çawski. While the P.11 had been powered with a license- built Bristol Mercury radial engine, the terms of this license did not permit PZL to export the engine as well as placing restrictions upon any aircraft that were powered by it. The French engine manufacturer Gnome-Rh√¥ne proposed the adoption of their 14K engine to PZL and offered to partially finance the development of a fighter using the engine, which would have no such export restrictions. Accordingly, during early 1932, PZL commenced work on a new derivative of the P.11, which became known as the P.24. The prototypes soon demonstrated favourable performance during testing; notably, the second P.24/II prototype, often referred to as the \\"Super P.24\\", established a new world speed record for a radial engine-powered fighter of 414 km/h. The initial production aircraft closely resembled the P.24/II configuration, albeit with some changes such as the adoption of an enclosed cockpit. First entering operational service during 1936, the P.24 was exported to multiple countries, including Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Turkey. It was produced under licence by Romanian aviation firm Industria AeronauticƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ (IAR), who had also licence-produced the earlier P.11 as well. Reportedly, elements of the P.24, such as its tail section, were incorporated into a Romanian- designed monoplane fighter, the IAR 80. In Greece, the Royal Hellenic Air Force (EVA) was the only air service in Second World War to operate the P.24 as its primary fighter. However, wartime experience soon showed that, as a result of the rapid advances in aircraft design made during the late 1930s, the P.24 had become obsolete in comparison to newer fighters as early as 1940. Despite a relatively powerful engine and satisfactory armament, it could not stand up against some of the Axis fighters, such as the Macchi MC.200 and the Fiat G.50. Just like the Greek fighters, by 1942, it had become clear that Romania's P.24s were unable to effectively challenge the fighters of the VVS, and were relegated to training operations. Development =Background= During the early 1930s, PZL had developed a series of innovative gull wing all-metal fighters, headed by Polish aeronautical engineer Zygmunt Pu≈Çawski. The P.1, the P.7, and the P.11, each more refined than its preceding aircraft, were capable of outstanding performance for their time and were widely displayed at international exhibitions and competitive fly-offs, demonstrating their capabilities to the world. The Polish monoplanes were subject to considerable international interest, leading to PZL's offices receiving a deluge of enquiries on the topic of prospective export sales. According to aviation author J.B. Cynk, by 1933, outward interest had been expressed by Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, France, Greece, Hungary, Japan, Portugal, Romania, Sweden, Turkey and Yugoslavia.Cynk 1967, p. 3. In order for any export sales of the type to be successfully completed, PZL had to address two major obstacles. Firstly, the company was only capable of producing so many aircraft in the space of a year; PZL did not have the internal resources to substantially expand its production capacity, nor was financing from the Polish government or other bodies viewed as being particularly forthcoming during this time. According to Cynk, tentative customers for the fighter were typically adverse to making large currency exchanges as part of their payments, instead, they would usually prefer to pay in terms of goods (such as raw resources and industrial products) or to pay in numerous installments. Furthermore, Cynk claims that several deals which had been formed with PZL had fallen through or had been otherwise postponed due to difficulties encountered in agreeing acceptable terms of payment between the customer and the manufacturer. Another issue was posed by the engine used by the P.11. It was powered by a single Bristol Mercury radial engine, which was produced in Poland under a licensing agreement with the British Bristol Aeroplane Company; however, the terms of the 10-year agreement had stipulated that none of the Polish-built engines could be exported. In addition, the licensing agreement had placed restrictions upon the sale of those aircraft which were powered by the Bristol engine; these export restrictions were present even if the engines were to be supplied by the customers rather than by PZL themselves. Naturally, PZL was keen to eliminate or otherwise minimise any restrictions that were deterring export sales of their aircraft. According to Cynk, the initiative to develop a dedicated export-focused derivative of the P.11 received a considerable boost during the early 1930s by a French Air Force initiative to furnish itself with a large force of modern first-rate fighters. While the majority of projects considered by French officials were indigenously- developed, the French Air Force was also evaluating various foreign fighters as potential candidates for being licence-produced in France; Cynk claims that the P.11 was at the top of their list. This attention may have contributed to the decision by French engine manufacturer Gnome-Rh√¥ne to offer PZL a financial contribution of 150,000 francs towards the development of an export- suitable P.11 derivative, as well as to provide the first prototype's engine for free and to sponsor the fighter for the French competition, all of which was conditional to the selection of their engine to power the type. =Project launch= In accordance with these converging interests, PZL decided to embark upon preliminary design work into the prospective development of a further evolved form of the P.11 that would be aimed specifically at the export market. The project, and the resulting design produced by it, soon received its own designation as the P.24. The Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14K, a powerful French radial engine, had quickly emerged as a strong candidate to power the tentative fighter; thus the engine company's offer of support was quickly accepted.Cynk 1967, pp. 3-4. The project was headed by Wsiewolod Jakimiuk, who had assumed the position early on after the untimely death of Pu≈Çawski on 21 March 1931. During February 1932, the P.24 proposal was submitted for internal approval; this was granted two months later. During May 1933, the first P.24/I prototype, which was largely based on the P.11a and powered by a Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14Kds engine, conducted its maiden flight, flown by Boles≈Çaw Orli≈Ñski. This flight had been delayed since January 1933 due to a failure on the part of Gnome-Rh√¥ne to promptly deliver either the engine or its three-bladed metal propeller. Even following the installation of the engine and an alternative Szomanski-built propeller, issues were encountered during pre-flight powered runs, such as seizing fuel pumps. The maiden flight had not gone smoothly either; it had been cut short after severe vibrations had shattered the hub fairing, further damage to the propeller blades, engine bearing structure, and fuel tank attachments was also incurred, leading to the forward section of the prototype being reconstructed and reinforced. During October 1933, flight tests resumed.Cynk 1967, p. 4. The experiences with the first prototype had determined that in excess of 150 modifications to various aspects of the design, including the adoption of a long-chord NACA cowling, the reinforcement of a cannon mounting structure and the revision of the exhaust and cooling systems, were required, leading to the construction of a second prototype, known as the P.24/II. Performing its first flight during March 1934, this prototype, also named the \\"Super P.24\\", quickly demonstrated its excellent performance, such as its ability to easily exceed 400 km/h in level flight. On 28 June 1934, P.24/II established a F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale- recognised world speed record for radial engine-powered fighters of 414 km/h. Following Gnome-Rh√¥ne's announcement of the existence of a more powerful 14Kfs engine, a third P.24/III prototype, otherwise known as the \\"Super P.24bis\\", was called for, powered by this new engine. However, this engine was not immediately available due to a prior order placed by Finland having taken precedence; as such, the first 14Kfs engine did not arrive until July 1934.Cynk 1967, pp. 4-5. During August 1934, the third prototype conducted its first flight; two months later, it performed a demonstration outside Warsaw attended by various Polish officials and several members of foreign missions. During late 1934, the newly-completed P.24/III was publicly displayed at the Paris Air Show, where it reportedly attracted a high level of interest from visitors and other participants alike. According to Cynk, at the time of the Paris Air Show, the P.24 was commonly considered to have been both the quickest and the best-armed interceptor in the world. While the French Air Force were still expressing interest in the P.24 at this point, there was considerable political resistance to the procurement of it due to its non- indigenous origins and that French manufacturers were making their own advances, including some of those that were featured upon the P.24. As such, a French order was not forthcoming for the type.Cynk 1967, p. 5. =Production= During late 1934 and early 1935, the P.24/III was involved in several promotional flights, including evaluation flights held near Warsaw on behalf of visiting Turkish and Romanian military officials, as well as a demonstration tour which saw it visit neighbouring Hungary and Bulgaria. In the spring of 1935, having judged the likelihood of sales to have been high at this point, PZL decided to commence work on a batch of six pre-production P.24s at their Warsaw plant. Unlike the prototypes, these aircraft had enclosed cockpits and the armaments were entirely carried within the wings rather than the forward fuselage, as well as the adoption of wing and tail surfaces reminiscent of the P.11c, alongside minor refinements and alterations. Different armament arrangements were installed across the pre- production aircraft, representative to the configuration that was intended for several separate production models. One pre-production aircraft was shown at the 1936 Paris Air Show, after which it conducted several demonstration flights on behalf of the French Air Force.Cynk 1967, pp. 5-6. Gradually, the pre-production P.24s were modified to closely represent successive production variants of the type; this work included the installation of alternative engines, including the Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14N01, the Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14N21, the Renault 14T, and the Fiat A.80, which were freely provided by their respective manufacturers. During early 1936, Turkey became the first customer to place a firm order for the P.24, completing a deal to not only by 40 Polish-built fighters, but also a licensing arrangement and the materials to domestically produce a further 20 P.24As. These early fighters, which were furnished with a range of different armaments to conform with the specified Turkish requirements, were otherwise nearly identical to the pre-production aircraft. Production commenced almost immediately; the first deliveries took place during late 1936.Cynk 1967, p. 6. Following the encountering of greater-than- anticipated drag on early production aircraft, various aerodynamic improvements were implemented upon the next variant of the fighter, designated as the P.24C, which made up the majority of the Turkish order. On 29 May 1937, the first Turkish-built P.24 conducted its maiden flight, flown by Izfam Bay. According to Cynk, it is believed that in excess of 100 P.24s were ultimately constructed in Turkey at a peak rate of eight fighters being finished per month. Over time, a large proportion of Turkey's P.24 fleet were reportedly refitted with American Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp radial engines. Further orders for the type soon came from Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania.Cynk 1967, pp. 6-7. These aircraft featured various modifications, including increased endurance, customised armaments, and further aerodynamic improvements.Cynk 1967, p. 7. Despite being an objectively superior fighter to its P.11 predecessor, no P.24s were ever acquired by the Polish Air Force, which preferred to wait for the more advanced PZL.50. When it had become clear that the PZL.50 would not become available in time to counter the now-imminent German attack, figures within the Polish Air Force, such as General J√≥zef ZajƒÖc, advocated an accelerated purchase of the type. In addition, the viability of such a venture was increased by the issuing of a French armament loan permitting a large quantity of 14K engines to be purchased by Poland. During early 1939, an initial order for 70 P.24Hs was placed. This order was supplemented by orders for a variant of the older P.11, the P.11G, as well.Cynk 1967, pp. 7-8. Despite numerous rumours claiming such, there were no PZL.24s in use by the Polish defenders during the Polish Campaign; these rumours may have been a result of the common misidentification of the P.11 as being the later P.24 by German spotters. As late as 1939, further improvements of the P.24 were being studied. The conceptual P.24K, which was to feature an armament of four 20mm cannon, and the P.24L, a dedicated fighter-bomber design, were amongst the proposals mooted. Furthermore, significant international interest in the type was present at this point. According to Cynk, during 1939, negotiations for several large orders were either at an advanced stage or had been finalised; these customers had included Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, and Yugoslavia. However, none of these orders, tentative or otherwise, totalling in excess of 190 P.24s, would be completed; they were effectively cancelled as a consequence of the German invasion and occupation of Poland during September 1939.Cynk 1967, p. 8. Design The PZL P.24 was a gull wing all-metal fighter aircraft that drew extensively on the design of the earlier P.11, being essentially a more powerful and export- friendly version of it. It possessed a relatively conventional in layout, but incorporated recent innovations such as its all-metal structure and exterior covering, along with its then-unusual wing shape. The gull wing, otherwise known as \\"the Polish wing\\", was developed by Polish aeronautical engineer Zygmunt Pu≈Çawski; it possessed several advantages over its biplane contemporaries. One such benefit was the thin profile it presented as it drew near to the fuselage, which avoided obstructing the exterior view for the pilot. The wings used a modified Bartler 37/11a aerofoil section, sharply tapering in chord and thickness towards the tips and roots and incorporating an upwards twist towards the trailing edge for improved visibility; they were largely composed of duralumin, including the twin spars, ribs, and corrugated exterior, which was smooth on the leading edge and wing tips. The fuselage of the P.24 possessed an oval all-metal structure, the forward section of which comprising built-up girder sections and the rear using a combination of transverse duralumin bulkheads and smooth stressed skin construction. The tail unit, which shared similar construction to the wings, was fitted with a cantilever fin, a braced tailplane, while the elevators were furnished with Flettner tabs. The P.24 was provided with a conventional \\"scissor-type\\" fixed landing gear arrangement; each leg incorporated an independently spring oleo- pneumatic shock absorber, built by Avia. The wheels were furnished with spats and worked in conjunction with a fixed skid located almost directly underneath the aircraft's tail section. The undercarriage configuration was a patented innovation. The P.24 was powered either by a Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14K or Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14N supercharged geared radial engine, ranging in output from 900 hp to 1,050 hp, which drove a three-bladed metal variable-pitch propeller.Cynk 1967, pp. 8-9. The armament was a combination of 20 mm Oerlikon FF cannon and 7.92 mm Colt-Browning machine guns in the wings. On the P.24A, P.24E and P.24F models, it was armed with a pair of cannon and a pair of machine guns, while the P.24B, P.24C and P.24G variants were armed with an arrangement of four machine guns. Fuel was housed with an internal 360 liter tank located within the fuselage; in case of fire or similar emergency situations, this tank could be jettisoned.Cynk 1967, p. 9. On all production P.24s, the canopy was fully enclosed; according to Cynk, it provided pilots with exceptionally high levels of external visibility in comparison to other fighter aircraft of the era. The pilot's seat was adjustable and could accommodate either a back or seat-type parachute; it was normally equipped with a Borkowski self-adjusting safety belt system. Operational history =Greece= The Royal Hellenic Air Force (EVA) was the only air force during the Second World War to operate the PZL.24 as its main fighter type. Two different subtypes, consisting of 30 P.24F and six P.24G, were ordered and delivered between 1937 and 1938.Cynk 1967, pp. 6-8. Upon arrival, these were split between three Mirae Dioxeos (Fighter Squadrons): the 21st at Trikala, 22nd at Thessaloniki and 23rd at Larissa. The only other operational Greek fighters, stationed further south, were eight Bloch MB.151s and two each Gloster Gladiator Mk Is and Avia B-534 II, both of which were of limited value. During October 1940, the month in which Italy launched its invasion of Greece, the Polish fighter was the Greeks' only modern type in adequate numbers.Cynk 1967, p. 9. However, by 1940, the P.24 was no longer a front-runner, despite its use of a powerful powerplant and a satisfactory armament; the P.24 had no speed advantage over the Fiat CR.42, nor could it outfly the nimble Italian biplane, while it was considerably slower than the Macchi MC.200 and the Fiat G.50 it was often pitted against. Its armament was the only real advantage against the Italian fighters, whose reliance on the slow-firing Breda-SAFAT 12.7mm machine guns proved detrimental.Cynk 1967, p. 11. The P.24F, armed with a pair of 20mm Oerlikon FF cannon and two machine guns, gave the Greeks a temporary edge in combat until lack of ammunition and spares forced EVA to re-arm all P.24Fs with 4x Colt‚ÄìBrowning 7.7 mm MG40 machine guns. Overall, the P.24s performed gallantly during the early period of the conflict, holding their own against impossible numerical odds and despite the fact that their main target were enemy bombers, which forced them to fight at a disadvantage against enemy fighters.Cynk 1967, pp. 9-10. Italian claims of easy superiority over the Albanian front were vastly exaggerated and their kill claims even exceeded the total number of operational fighters on the Greek side. In total, Greek fighter losses in combat came to 24 aircraft, while the Greek fighter pilots claimed to have achieved 64 confirmed kills and 24 probables, around two-thirds of which were bombers). By April 1941, however, lack of spares and attrition had forced EVA to merge the five surviving P.24s into one understrength squadron, which was supported by five Gloster Gladiator Mk I and II's and the two surviving MB.151s. That month, these remaining fighters fought hopelessly against the Luftwaffe onslaught, scoring 4 kills (two Hs-126, one Ju 87B and one Do 17) while losing most of their surviving aircraft on the ground.Cynk 1967, pp. 10-11. None of the Pulawski fighters are believed to have survived the conflict. =Romania= Prior to its procurement of the P.24, the Romanian Air Force had already adopted the P.11F, which was manufactured under license by Industria AeronauticƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ (IAR) in Romania. The Romanian Air Force acquired a production license for the type along with an initial batch of six Polish- built P.24Es, which served as pattern aircraft. The P.24E was specifically designed in conform with the requirements set out by the Romanian Air Force, including compatibility with its IAR-built model of the 14K engine, its two- cannon and two-machine gun armament, and various refinements and aerodynamic improvements. Under the established licensing agreement, IAR proceeded with the construction of 25 IAR P.24E fighters by IAR between 1937 and 1939.Bern√°d 1999, p. 45. According to Cynk, the P.24E had played a significant role in the development of a new Romanian low-wing monoplane fighter, which was designated as the IAR 80. Specifically, the new fighter had adopted a fuselage which had been derived from the P.24, along with a nearly-identical tail section, which was paired up to a new cantilever wing and an inwardly-retractable undercarriage. In Romanian service, the type saw combat action during the Second World War; early on, Romanian P.24s were used to guard the capital city of Bucharest and the Ploie≈üti oilfields from attacks by Soviet bombers during the start of Operation Barbarossa. Flying from Otopeni military airbase, the P.24 fighters reportedly managed to shoot down 37 VVS bombers, which were typically unescorted and thereby more vulnerable to interception.Bern√°d 1999, p. 15. The P.24E was also routinely used for ground attack missions until the end of 1941; however, after 1942, the type was relegated to training duties because of its obsolescence in the face of improved opposition fighter aircraft. Variants During the development of Pulawski fighters, a new version of the P.11, the P.11c, was developed for the Polish Air Force. It had a new, reconfigured fuselage, and the radial engine was lowered to give a pilot a better view. These changes were applied also to the new P.24 prototype, flown in 1936. The P.24A and P.24B models could carry 4 x 12.5 kg bombs, while the P.24C, F and G could carry 2 x 50 kg bombs. ;P.24 :This design used the whole tail fuselage section from the P.11c, was powered with a Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14Kfs engine (930 hp), and was armed with two 20 mm cannon and two machine guns. ;P.24A :It entered production as the P.24A. ;P.24B :The P.24B version was armed with four machine guns. ;P.24C :The P.24C was armed with four machine guns and two 50 kg bombs. ;P.24D :The P.24D was developed for sale to Hungary, but it was not completed, Hungary purchasing the Fiat CR.32 instead. ;IAR P.24E :The P.24E version was license-built in Romania by Industria AeronauticƒÉ Rom√¢nƒÉ as the IAR P.24E. ;P.24F :The P.24F was armed with two cannon and two machine guns and bombs and powered with the more powerful Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14N-07 engine. ;P.24G :The last production version was the P.24G, produced from 1937 and powered with the more powerful Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14N-07 engine. The P.24G was armed with four machine guns and bombs. ;P.24H :The P.24H was to be powered with a Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14N-21 engine (1,100 hp) and carry four cannon or two cannon and two machine guns, but it was not completed. The P.24H was considered for purchase by the Polish Air Force, but progress was slow due to the P.24's similarity to the PZL P.11, which was already in service, and also interest in the hypothetically superior PZL.50 JastrzƒÖb then under development. World War II started before any of these plans could be realized. ;P.24J :The P.24J version was to be armed with four cannon and was to be sold for export. ;P-24/I :2 permanently guns pilot Vickers wz.

An active promoter of and contributor to fascist ideology and anti-Semitic sentiment, he was a financial backer of the Iron Guard in the late 1930s. His corporatist ideas influenced economic policy in several countries during the 1930s, particularly in Brazil. Biography =Early life= Born to a political family in Tecuci, he was the nephew of Alexandru BƒÉdƒÉrƒÉu, twice a minister in Conservative cabinets during the early 1900s, and a descendant of the Moldavian boyar known as LogofƒÉtul TƒÉutu; his grandfather was strong unionist, a supporter of the Union of Moldova with Wallachia, while his father was a member of the Socialist Party.Valeriu Dinu, \\"Prefa»õƒÉ. Schi»õƒÉ de portret: Mihail Manoilescu\\", √Æn Mihail Manoilescu, Memorii, 2 volume, edi»õie √ÆngrijitƒÉ, prefa»õƒÉ, note »ôi indice Valeriu Dinu, cuv√¢nt √Ænainte Mugur IsƒÉrescu (Bucure»ôti: Editura EnciclopedicƒÉ, 1993), p. 7. The Manoilescus moved to Ia≈üi when Mihail was a child. Having been the recipient of the Gazeta MatematicƒÉ prize in 1910, he went on to study at the \\"»òcoala de Poduri »ôi »òosele\\" (the School of Bridges and Roads) in Bucharest, completing his training as a valedictorian in 1915.Dinu, \\"Prefa»õƒÉ\\", p. 7. Manoilescu was subsequently assigned to the Ministry of Public Works, and later moved to an artillery regiment in Roman.MihƒÉi»õƒÉ. Upon Romania's entry into World War I, he was assigned to the Directorate of Ammunitions (led by Tancred Constantinescu), and designed an original type of 210 mm howitzer, which, after southern Romania was invaded by the Central Powers (see Romanian Campaign), was produced in Nicolina.MihƒÉi≈£ƒÉ After the conflict, in 1919, he had a minor role in the National Liberal Party (PNL) governments, assisting General Constantinescu as Head of the Industrial Recovery Directorate and later as General Director of Industry. =With Averescu= Soon, Manoilescu joined the People's Party, a populist force led by General Alexandru Averescu, becoming undersecretary of state in the latter's first cabinet.H√Æncu, p.69; Ornea, p.265 He was responsible for measures such as organizing the Industrial Exhibition, carrying out industrial statistics, and unifying legislation related to the industry. In 1921, he resigned his ministerial position, justifying it as an attempt to further his expertise and investigative range. During the period when the PNL returned to government, Manoilescu focused on his research, and contributed 18 individual works. He also became influential as an orator, and was a frequent presence in conferences hosted by the sociologist Dimitrie Gusti. Manoilescu returned to high office with the second Averescu executive, and drafted innovative legislation concerning tariffs and salary amortization. In 1926, while on a mission to Italy, where he was to negotiate a loan and pave the way for the friendship treaty signed between the two countries,H√Æncu, p.69; MihƒÉi≈£ƒÉ he met the fascist dictator Benito Mussolini and became his admirer (calling the Fascist regime \\"a truly constructive political revolution, one that can only compare itself with the great French revolution in scale and novelty\\").Manoilescu, 1926, in H√Æncu, p.69 Subsequently, he was active in collaboration with the Comitati d'azione per l'universalit√† di Roma and other Italian-led projects of international cooperation.Ornea, p.266; Veiga, p.253 =1927 trial= He was then an advocate of the crowning of Carol Caraiman as King of Romania (in the place of his underage son Mihai).Ciachir; MihƒÉi≈£ƒÉ; Ornea, p.265 In the autumn of 1927, while distributing Carol's appeals to the leaders of various political parties and carrying his letter to Queen Marie, he was arrested (martial law was proclaimed by the Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu government in the incident's wake).\\"More Carol-ings\\"; \\"Manoilescu Trial\\" Manoilescu, who benefited from Averescu's vocal support, was acquitted when tried by a court subordinated to the Council of War in late November.Ciachir; \\"Manoilescu Acquitted\\" His own testimony was indicated by Time as arguing that Carol was alarmed by an alleged growth in republicanism and only wished to be part of the Regency.\\"Manoilescu Trial\\" He also stated: > \\"The Prince is too loyal and decent to think of dethroning his own > son.\\"Manoilescu, in \\"Manoilescu Trial\\" While accusing the executive of having previously attempted to purchase his silence, Manoilescu stressed his belief that King Ferdinand had, just before his death, asked BrƒÉtianu for Carol to be allowed to return. He also speculated that Ferdinand had endorsed a regency only for as long as Carol continued to behave irresponsibly, and had not wanted to exclude his son from the throne. Averescu, who unsuccessfully called on both Carol and BrƒÉtianu to take the stand, backed this version by mentioning his own experience as a mediator between Ferdinand and Carol, during which the latter had allegedly agreed to comply, while the former had eventually become more open to Carol's return.\\"Manoilescu Acquitted\\" The acquittal came as a shock, given rumors that Premier BrƒÉtianu had instructed the court to find Manoilescu guilty.Ciachir In an unusual incident during the first day of trial, news correspondents from abroad were told that international phone connections had been severed‚Äîthey resorted to crossing the Danube into Bulgaria at Giurgiu, using phones there to contact their employers, and repeated the trip several times over the following days. =Camarilla= After Carol returned to rule as Carol II in mid-1930, Manoilescu was a very influential person in the king's camarilla, being the Minister of Economy in the National Peasants' Party (PN≈¢) cabinets of Iuliu Maniu and Gheorghe Mironescu (while he was a member of that party),Ornea, p.273; Pandrea as well as under Nicolae Iorga (1930‚Äì1931).Ornea, p.265; Veiga, p.127, 129, 213-214 He was elected to the Assembly of Deputies for the PN≈¢ in 1930, representing Cara≈ü County. His political adversaries speculated that he had forged documents and played a hand in bringing Carol's mistress, Magda Lupescu, back into the country.Argetoianu, p.87 In his memoirs, Manoilescu claimed that, at the time, he had played a hand in the release of Mihai Gheorghiu Bujor (imprisoned since 1918, due to his Bolshevik activism and designs for a communist revolution);Cioroianu, p.28 Manoilescu authored a series of articles in his support, and allegedly intervened alongside King Carol (it is generally accepted that the most decisive action in this respect was taken by Maniu, who spoke against imprisonment for political crimes such as Bujor's). At the time, he became a staunch rival of his fellow PN≈¢ member Virgil Madgearu. According to Petre Pandrea's hostile account, Manoilescu purchased from the writers Sergiu Dan and Ion Vinea an allegedly stolen text which appeared to be entirely written by Madgearu, but had been heavily forged by the two to include criticism of the king; Manoilescu attempted to use the document against its supposed author, but was exposed by Carol himself (who, according to Pandrea, was amused by the events).Pandrea The incident contributed to PN≈¢ inner-conflict that caused Manoilescu to leave the grouping. In 1931, Manoilescu was governor of the National Bank of Romania and began teaching Political economy at the Polytechnic Institute. As governor, he refused to salvage the Marmorosch Blank Bank with state funds, and clashed with Carol over the issue, being ultimately removed from office in November of the same year. He began editing a magazine, Lumea NouƒÉ, which was to become the main platform for his ideas, and, in 1932, created his own party‚ÄîLiga Na≈£ional-CorporatistƒÉ (National-Corporatist League).BoatcƒÉ, p.23; Veiga, p.214 Between 1932 and 1937, he was assigned a seat in the Senate, representing the Romanian Chamber of Commerce. =Political and economic theories= In Paris in 1929, he published the first version of his fundamental work, The theory of protectionism and international exchanges at the Giard publishing house (as part of the \\"Biblioth√®que √âconomique Internationale\\" collection). His intense advocacy of industrialization formed the main theme of the book The role and destiny of Romania's bourgeoisie (1942), which was one of the main works dealing with the development of a local middle class, alongside those written by ≈ûtefan Zeletin and Eugen Lovinescu (while sharing some perspectives with the essays of Emil Cioran);Ornea, p.48, 138, 266 the topic blended with his support for authoritarianism and the one-party system, as Manoilescu rejected democracy (which, in his view, encouraged the majority-forming peasantry to decide on matters that did not concern it).Ornea, p.46, 268-269; Stahl The role and destiny... criticized the course of Romanian social development: > \\"[...] an oversized bourgeoisie which mimicks the boyars of yesteryear and > has an over-bourgeois way of living, oversized in comparison with its means, > creates a certain social instability and features a high percentage of > individual failures. > That is why the Romanian bourgeoisie is not in fact a bourgeoisie in one of > its most essential features; whereas the Occident focuses on accumulation, > security and the future, our bourgeoisie will focus on spending, > satisfaction and the present. Whereas the Western bourgeois work for their > children, the Romanian bourgeois will often only work for > themselves.\\"Manoilescu, in Scurtu et al. (Manoilescu's italics) Among others, Manoilescu adopted some of the Poporanist ideas on capital and its international circulation, as present in the works of Constantin StereBoatcƒÉ, p.23; Love (in turn influenced by the Marxist Werner Sombart).BoatcƒÉ, p.17; Love He argued that a national economy could develop only if it minimized its contacts with the world market and relied instead on cultivating internal demand for a local industry.Chirot, p.250; Gallagher, p.33 At the same time, his magazine supported a nationalist and racist approach, viewing corporatism as \\"the guarantee of Romanianization\\",Victor Munteanu, 1936, in Ornea, p.273 and proclaiming that \\"the racial basis of Romania is the same as that of Aryan Europe\\".Al. Randa, 1941, in Ornea, p.108 Manoilescu himself welcomed the anti-Semitic policies of the Alexandru Vaida- Voevod government.Ornea, p.273-274 Manoilescu's corporatist and protectionist ideas began to be applied in Brazil, as the basis of that country's industrial development during its Estado Novo regime.Love His opinion that the engagement of productive forces in industry, seen as always more productive than agriculture and other raw materials, is a welcomed process constituted an influence on both Celso Furtado and Ra√∫l Prebisch (arguably, it also indirectly influenced the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean). Disputed by several neoclassical theorists, Manoilescu's ideas were abandoned after the 1930s. Manoilescu influenced not only business circles in Brazil, but his arguments were also referred to by the Lewiatan Group in Poland.Dilek Barlas, BRILL, 1998, Etatism and Diplomacy in Turkey: Economic and Foreign Policy Strategies in an Uncertain World, 1929-1939, p. 29 Mihail Manoilescu, together with the French economist Fran√ßois Perroux, prepared the way for the reception of corporatism in Brazil during the 1930s.Love, p. 221 Establishing corporatism in Brazil was partly achieved by translating and publishing into Portuguese some of Manoilescu's works.Elizabeth McQuerry, University of Texas at Austin, 1995, Economic liberalization in Brazil: business responses & changing patterns of behavior, p. 52 During the Interwar, Manoilescu's economic and political essays were published in Spain, Portugal, Brazil and Chile. His works also had some influence in Argentina, although not as much as in Brazil and Chile.Peter Hanns Reill, Central European University Press, 2011, Cores, Peripheries, and Globalization, p. 27 On the other hand, Manoilescu's advocacy of autarkic measures has been compared to the measures enforced by later Stalinist regimes, including that of Nicolae Ceau≈üescu in Romania,Chirot, p.251; Gallagher, p.33 who on at least one occasion described his works as a major contribution to the theory of underdevelopment.Gallagher, p.33 =Iron Guard= Despite the increasingly tense relations between Carol and the fascist Iron Guard, Manoilescu was viewed with interest by the latter.Argetoianu, p.87; Ornea, p.270 By the late 1930s, he was himself a supporter of the Guard (which he hoped to see turning into a corporatist movement‚Äî\\"an instrument to validate the goals of the [Guard's] national revolution\\"),Manoilescu, 1937, in Ornea, p.277 and donated part of his land to one of the latter's enterprises.Ornea, p.270 His new discourse was ridiculed by his former colleagues in the National Peasants' Party, as \\"desperate attempts to exit from the [old generation of politicians] and sit among the new men\\".Dreptatea, 1937, in Ornea, p.275 In February 1937, he began discreetly financing the Guard's newly created paper, Buna Vestire (he was exposed as the man behind it by virtually all political commentators of the time).Ornea, p.275‚Äì276 In the election of 1937, he ran for the Senate on the Everything for the Fatherland Party list (which served as a front for the Iron Guard).Wojciech Roszkowski, Jan Kofman, Routledge, 2016, Biographical Dictionary of Central and Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century, p. 624 According to his political adversary Constantin Argetoianu, the party's unofficial leader Corneliu Zelea Codreanu made similar proposals to philosopher Nae Ionescu and General Gheorghe Moruzi: Ionescu denied the request because, as a self-proclaimed pillar of the Guard, he could not accept such a lowly position, while Moruzi called Manoilescu \\"a con artist\\" and alluded to his reported connection with Magda Lupescu. Argetoianu sarcastically remarked, \\"the party of ¬´moral regeneration¬ª was left with one guest, with Manoilescu!\\" During the period, Manoilescu also applied changes to his earlier vision on industry and self-sufficiency, calling for Romania to develop itself by supplying raw materials to the rising force that was Nazi Germany.Gallagher, p.33; Stahl =Foreign Minister= In July 1940, at the moment of crisis when Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina were ceded to the Soviet Union, Manoilescu was named foreign minister in the pro-fascist government headed by Ion Gigurtu. The new executive was faced with eventually successful attempts by Hungary, backed by Italy and Nazi Germany, to revise its border with Romania by the Treaty of Trianon, in reality a dictate. Manoilescu, who was a supporter of the Axis alliance,Ornea, p.270‚Äì272; ≈ûandru attempted in vain to make use of his influence with Italian authorities. In order to ensure less international adversity toward Romania, he also offered to cede Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria (although Germany had not included this revision in its demands toward the Romanian executive), an approach eventually leading to the Treaty of Craiova. As foreign minister of Romania convoked by the Axis, on August 30, he signed the Second Vienna Award, which divided Transylvania between Hungary and Romania (see Northern Transylvania).\\"Fire in the Carpathians\\"; MihƒÉi≈£ƒÉ; Ornea, p.265 While German Foreign Minister, Joachim von Ribbentrop, communicated the final decision, in the Gold Room of the Belvedere Palace, Manoilescu fainted, after seeing the map of the new borders, imposed by Germany and Italy, whilst the Hungarian side jubilated.\\"Fire in the Carpathians\\" In September, he was involved in negotiations with Soviet envoys regarding a d√©tente between the two countries; at the time, examining the situation created by warm relations between the Axis and the Soviet Union (see Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact), the fall of France and the United Kingdom's isolation (which had deprived Romania of diplomatic alternatives), Manoilescu argued that Romania looked \\"with respect\\" towards Moscow, Berlin, and Rome.Manoilescu, in ≈ûandru Asked by the Soviet delegation to account for alleged new border incidents, he stiffly denied that these had ever occurred.≈ûandru =1940s, imprisonment and death= The responsibility for the Transylvanian compromise weighed heavily on him later in the following year, when the Iron Guard, revived by the leadership of Horia Sima, came to government and proclaimed the National Legionary State; it refused to appoint Manoilescu to any leadership position.Ornea, p.280 He did however continue to serve as Foreign Minister during the short-lived First Antonescu cabinet, bringing the overall duration of his 1940 term to 70 days (July 4 to September 14).National Commission of the Socialist Republic of Romania for UNESCO, 1972, Chronological history of Romania, p. 426 After the Iron Guard's 1941 Rebellion, he remained present on the political stage as a supporter of Ion Antonescu's dictatorship (see Romania during World War II).MihƒÉi≈£ƒÉ; Ornea, p.284-285 In autumn 1940, he represented his country to Rome, where he attempted to persuade Italian officials to look into information about Hungarian violence in Northern Transylvania, and, in July 1942, traveled to the Independent State of Croatia to meet with Otto Franges, his collaborator on an overview of Southeast European economy. On October 12, 1944, as Romania signed an armistice with the United Nations, Manoilescu was jailed without trial for 14 months, during which time he was expelled from his position at the Polytechnic Institute. Because of the bad sanitary conditions in prison, he became sick with endemic typhus, and sent to the hospital for contagious diseases in Colentina.Harre Set free in December 1945, he resumed work on his unfinished writings, and became an advocate of harvesting geothermal power in Romania (his innovations in the field were patented on the name of his son, Alexandru Manoilescu). He was once again jailed by Communist Romanian authorities on December 19, 1948, and was brought first to Jilava prison, and then to the prison of Ocnele Mari. While being held there, Manoilescu became, together with the philosopher Petre ≈¢u≈£ea, a members of an \\"underground academy\\" organized by inmates.Popescu, p.80 Manoilescu was ultimately brought to Sighet prison, where he died at the end of 1950.Dinu, p. 14; Chirot, p.250; Gallagher, p.33 Typhus had left him with heart problems, which were aggravated in detention; with no medical attention, this led to his death; his body was buried in a common grave. In 1951, although deceased, he was brought to trial by a civil court for his journalistic activities. On April 12, 1952 he was sentenced in absentia to 15 years in prison, 10 years deprivation of civil rights, and confiscation of all property, a measure which is thought to be unprecedented.Dinu, \\"Prefa»õƒÉ\\", p. 14. His family was told of his death only in May 1958.Dinu, p. 14. Honors In the world of economics, Manoilescu is primarily remembered for the \\"Manoilescu argument\\", which states that when the marginal productivity of labor in agriculture is lower than that in other sectors, surplus labor should be redirected to higher-productivity activities, such as manufacturing. On 14 April 2016, the National Bank of Romania issued a set of commemorative coins in honor of three former bank governors. Manoilescu, who led the bank for several months in 1931, was among them. Manoilescu's inclusion drew strong protests from the U.S. Embassy in Romania and the Wiesel Institute, on the grounds of Manoilescu's advocacy of Fascist ideology and antisemitism before World War II. In spite of the criticism, the Bank did not withdraw the coin.US Department of State, ROMANIA 2016 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT, p. 34 In the city of Ploie»ôti, a high school bears his name.

He was a member of the Venetian School, and was perhaps more famous and influential as a performer than as a composer. Nothing is known about his life prior to his arrival at Venice, but he was probably born at Udine sometime before the middle of the 16th century. He was first hired by the musical establishment of St Mark's Basilica on 29 January 1568, along with his two brothers, Giovanni and Nicol√≤, where they formed the first permanent instrumental ensemble . The sonorous acoustical environment of this basilica was the center of activity of the Venetians. Giovanni Gabrieli clearly had Dalla Casa's group in mind for much of his music, and the Dalla Casas are presumed to have played in many the elaborate polychoral compositions of the time. In 1572, Dalla Casa served as Venetian agent for the purchase of a large number of wind instruments and printed editions of music for the court of John of Austria, half-brother of Philip II of Spain and hero of the Battle of Lepanto in the previous year. The transaction, made though the Spanish resident ambassador in Venice, Diego Guzm√°n de Silva, came to the considerable sum of 154 scudi, 3 lire, and 20 soldi in gold. The instruments purchased included four tenor and two soprano shawms, six alto cornetts, five mute cornetts, two large [bass?] cornetts, two dulcians, and trumpets from Nuremberg and Augsburg. An unusually large sum was charged for a \\"'cassa di flauti grossi\\" (chest of large recorders), which may have included several SATB consorts. The music included five printed books by Cipriano de Rore, four books by Orlando di Lasso, four books by Vincenzo Ruffo, and a collection by Pedro Guerrero, as well as other books whose contents were not specified in the receipt, which is dated 20 February 1572 and signed in Dalla Casa's hand . Dalla Casa was a virtuoso player of the cornett (; ), which he described as 'the most excellent of all the wind instruments ... because it mimics the human voice better than the other instruments do' . The use of the Dalla Casas by Gabrieli and St. Mark's foreshadowed, and may have influenced, the development of the concertino- ripieno style of the concerto grosso in the later Baroque. Being a smaller group of virtuoso instrumentalists playing in contrast to larger instrumental and vocal forces arrayed around them, and being in the center of a hugely influential stylistic movement, they functioned as an early form of concertino. Much of the music which Gabrieli and the other Venetians wrote for them survives. Two books of madrigals and one book of motets survive from his compositional output, which probably was not large. More important to musicology, however, was his two-part 1584 treatise on ornamentation (Il vero modo di diminuir), which gives clear and precise examples of ornamentation as it was practiced in singing and playing French chansons and Italian madrigals at the time. In contrast to earlier ornamentation treatises, Dalla Casa introduced short ornamental patterns with jerky and discontinuous rhythms, such as the tremoli groppizati and groppi battute, to emphasize particular notes and heighten their emotional effect. Diminutions on intervalic skips of sixths, sevenths, and octaves also appear for the first time in this treatise, which is therefore regarded as marking the end of the purely Renaissance style of ornamentation and the beginnings of Baroque practice . From this treatise it is clear that polyphonic works were usually performed unadorned, but works in a more homophonic style, and especially grand polychoral works with frequent sectional changes and prominent cadences, were embellished with ornaments, few of which appear in the actual notated music.

Bromo-DragonFLY is considered a potent hallucinogen, having around one third the potency of LSD with a normal dose in the region of 200 Œºg to 800 Œºg, and it has an extremely long duration of action, up to several days. Bromo-DragonFLY has a stereocenter and (R)-(‚àí)-bromo-DragonFLY is the more active stereoisomer. History Bromo- DragonFLY was first synthesized by Matthew Parker in the laboratory of David E. Nichols in 1998. As with the earlier and less potent dihydrofuran series of compounds nicknamed FLY, Bromo-DragonFLY was named after its superficial structural resemblance to a dragonfly. Pharmacology Bromo-DragonFLY also has a high binding affinity for the 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C serotonin receptors, and is most accurately described as a non-subtype selective 5-HT2 agonist, as it is actually twice as potent an agonist for 5-HT2C receptors as for 5-HT2A, as well as being less than 5x selective for 5-HT2A over 5-HT2B. Bromo-DragonFLY is also a MAO-A inhibitor, and thus strongly inhibits oxidative deamination of 5-HT, increasing its risk profile. Dosage The typical dose of Bromo- DragonFLY is not known, however it has varied from 500 Œºg to 1 mg. It has about 300 times the potency of mescaline, or 1/3 the potency of LSD. It has been sold in the form of blotters, similar to the distribution method of LSD, which has led to confusion and reports of mistakenly consuming Bromo- DragonFly. It has a much longer duration of action than LSD and can last for up to 2‚Äì3 days following a single large dose, with a slow onset of action that can take up to 6 hours before the effects are felt. Toxicity 4BDF powder. The pink color is most likely due to an impurity. The color of pure BDF is usually white to off-white, similar to most recreational drugs, so there is no way to distinguish between them by eye. The toxicity of Bromo-DragonFLY appears to be fairly high for humans, with reports of at least five deaths believed to have resulted from Bromo-DragonFLY reported in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and the United States. Laboratory testing has confirmed that in October 2009, a batch of Bromo-Dragonfly was distributed, mislabeled as the related compound 2C-B-FLY, which is around 20x less potent than BDF by weight. This mistake is believed to have contributed to several lethal overdoses and additional hospitalizations. The batch implicated in these deaths also contained significant synthesis impurities, which may have contributed to the toxicity. Vasoconstrictive action resulting from severe overdose of Bromo- DragonFLY is known to have caused tissue necrosis of the extremities in at least one case. In September 2007, a 35-year-old Swedish male required amputation of the front part of his feet and several fingers on one hand after taking a massive (but unknown) overdose; reportedly, the compound acted as a long-acting efficacious vasoconstrictor, leading to necrosis and gangrene which became apparent several weeks after the overdose occurred. Treatment was of limited efficacy in this case, although tolazoline is reportedly an effective treatment where available.Bromo-dragonfly ‚Äì livsfarlig missbruksdrog (Swedish) Overdose-associated disturbing experiences and health problems have been described. One case in 2008 in England involved inhalation of vomit, causing nearly fatal asphyxia. Seizures have also been reported. On October 3, 2009, a 22-year-old male from Copenhagen died after ingesting Bromo-dragonfly. His friend described the trip saying, \\"It was like being dragged to hell and back again. Many times. It is the most evil [thing] I've ever tried. It lasted an eternity.\\" On May 7, 2011, in the United States, two young adults died after overdosing on Bromo-DragonFLY, which they thought was 2C-E, and several others were hospitalized during the same incident. Because they took a dosage appropriate for 2C-E, those who took the drug received, in some cases, 100x the normal dose. Both deaths followed seizures, vomiting blood, and terrifying hallucinations. Several surviving victims are reportedly still suffering from its physical effects. Drug prohibition laws =United States= Bromo- DragonFLY is listed as a Schedule I in Oklahoma. =Canada= Schedule III as of Oct 12, 2016. \\"2C-phenethylamines and their salts, derivatives, isomers and salts of derivatives and isomers that correspond\\" to a broad definition that includes anything with a 2,5-dimethoxyphenylethamine core. This includes most 2C-s, DOx, TMA, Aleph, NBOMes, NBOHs, NBF, bk-2-C-B, 2C-B-Fly, Bromo- DragonFLY, etc. See http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp- pr/p2/2016/2016-05-04/html/sor-dors73-eng.php. =United Kingdom= Bromo- DragonFLY is widely reported by the media as being a Class A drug. However, as of 2014, it remains unclear to what extent it is covered by the UK phenylethylamine catch-all clause, with commentators noting both the structural similarities and differences to the phenylethylamine class. If the prosecution could demonstrate structural similarity in court, it would be considered a Class A substance but as a benzodifuran it is significantly different to this class. It is not explicitly named in the misuse of drugs act. It would be covered by the UK Psychoactive Substances Act 2016. =Sweden= Sveriges riksdag added Bromo-Dragonfly to schedule IV (\\"substances, plant materials and fungi with medical use\\") as narcotics in Sweden as of Jan 3, 2008, published by Medical Products Agency in their regulation LVFS 2007:14 listed as Bromo-Dragonfly, brombensodifuranyl- isopropylamin. Bromo-DragonFLY was first classified as \\"health hazard\\" by Sveriges riksdags health ministry under the act (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of Jul 15, 2007, in their regulation SFS 2007:600 listed as brombensodifuranylisopropylamin (Bromo- Dragonfly), making it illegal to sell or possess. =Denmark= On December 3, 2007 the drug was banned in Denmark. The substance has been declared illegal by health minister Jakob Axel Nielsen, following recommendations from the Danish Health Ministry. It is currently classified as a dangerous narcotic and therefore its possession, manufacture, importation, supply or usage is strictly prohibited. Anyone involved in such activities can face legal action. =Norway= Bromo-DragonFLY is currently on the Norwegian narcotics list,. Thus it is effectively a narcotic drug by Norwegian law. =Poland= Currently, Bromo-DragonFLY is an uncontrolled substance in Poland. =Romania= The chemical compound has been added as an illegal substance under the Law 143/2000 on February 10, 2010. =Australia= As of 9 September 2011, Bromo-DragonFLY was added to Schedule 2 of the Queensland Drugs Misuse Regulation 1987. Nationally, the drug is listed under Schedule 9 (Prohibited) of the Poisons Standard. Accordingly, the drug is prohibited in all states and territories.Poisons Standard October 2015 =Finland= As of 12 March 2012, Bromo-DragonFLY is an illegal designer drug.Design drugs See also * 2C-B * DOB * 2C-B-FLY * 5-HT2A receptor * PiHKAL Notes References  Bromo-dragonfly ‚Äì livsfarlig missbruksdrog * Per, 35, blev stympad av d√∂dsdrogen - V√•rdades i respirator i tio dygn efter att ha tagit Bromo- Dragonfly * * Category:Bromoarenes Category:Designer drugs Category:Entheogens Category:Psychedelic phenethylamines Category:Serotonin receptor agonists Category:Substituted amphetamines ","title":"Bromo-DragonFLY"},{"id":"1139094","text":"Norman Island is an island at the southern tip of the British Virgin Islands archipelago. It is one of a number of islands reputed to be the inspiration for Robert Louis Stevenson's pirate novel Treasure Island.\\"Where's Where\\" (1974) (Eyre Methuen, London) , Norman Island.  History  It is said that the island was named after a pirate who bought it or leased it at some point during the early 18th century,See for example, Welcome Magazine, Vol. 36, No. 1: \\"The Real Pirates of the Caribbean\\" although supporting evidence for this contention is difficult to find. However, Norman Island also has a documented history of pirate booty being stowed upon the island. In August 1750, a Spanish treasure galleon named Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe sought shelter from a storm on the North Carolina coast. The crew mutinied and the treasure, said to consist of (amongst other things) 55 chests of silver coins, was loaded into two bilanders, one of which was manned by Owen Lloyd. The first vessel was lost, but Lloyd escaped to St. Croix. After disposing of some of the money, he proceeded to Norman Island where the treasure was buried. Lloyd and his crew were later arrested in St. Eustatius, but word of the treasure spread, and residents of Tortola went to Norman Island and dug it up for themselves. Part of the booty was later recovered by Gilbert Fleming, Lieutenant-General of the Leeward Islands at the time, who travelled to Tortola with two companies of soldiers. Fleming persuaded Abraham Chalwill, the acting Lieutenant Governor of the British Virgin Islands (who had coincidentally led the search for the treasure on Norman Island) to issue a proclamation whereby the treasure would be returned and the people who had dug it up would receive a one-third share as a reward.A History of the British Virgin Islands, Isaac Dookahn, There the historical record ends, but local rumours abound that a member of a well-known local family had been fishing near Norman Island and took shelter in one of the caves on the Western coast of Norman Island during a storm. The surge repeatedly banged his small boat against the walls of the cave, whilst the storm surge caused the water level to rise several feet. When the fortunate fisherman woke the next morning, a large number of rocks had broken off into his small craft, as had a small chest, supposedly filled with gold doubloons. The story cannot be verified as no legal application for treasure trove was ever made,Under applicable British Virgin Islands law, the Government would probably have been entitled to a half share, depending upon the coroner's finding as to the circumstances of the treasure's coming to be in the cave. but it is known that members of the family ceased being fisherman and left Tortola at about the time to open some shops in Charlotte Amalie in St. Thomas. Rumours persist of more pirate gold to be found on Norman Island, although to date no applications have ever been made for treasure trove.  Today  The island is uninhabited and privately owned by Henry Jarecki. Its area is about , and it is about long. A large harbour known as the Bight offers one of the most protected anchorages in the area. It is one of the \\"Little Sisters\\", along with Pelican Island, Peter Island, Salt Island, Dead Chest Island, and Ginger Island. This group of islands is smaller, lower, and more arid than other islands to the north and west. Snorkeling inside a cave at Norman Island, the island of Tortola is visible in the background Norman Island is a well-known destination for cruisers and other tourists because of three water-level caves at the base of cliffs just outside the western edge of the Bight. The caves are ideal for snorkeling, and, if one goes deeply enough into the cliffs, darkness makes the experience like a night dive. The island has no permanent inhabitants (other than wild goats), but there are two restaurants on the island, Pirates Bight and The Club. Previously anchored in the Bight was a modern copy of an old schooner named the Willy T, which operated as a bar and restaurant. In September 2017, the Willy T was destroyed by Hurricane Irma. The owners of the Willy T had a new ship built and in May 2018 it was announced that the BVI government would not let the Willy T anchor on Norman Island, but would instead be able to anchor in Great Harbour on Peter Island. The Willy T has since returned to its original location on Norman Island. = Cultural legacy = Some think that Norman Island and the tales about its treasures have inspired Robert Louis Stevenson to write Treasure Island. The estimated timeframe of Treasure Island approximates to the time of the salvaging of the booty of the Nuestra Se√±ora de Guadalupe on Norman Island. Norman Island has so many caves, hidden bays, and wrecks that many tourists still explore hoping to find treasure one day, and tourism operators in the British Virgin Islands have no interest in trying to discourage this. = Economic Development =  Joint Venture Agreement with the Henry Jarecki  On 22 November 2018, the BVI government, headed by Orlando Smith, entered into a Development Agreement with Audubon Holdings, owned by Henry Jarecki, to develop Norman Island as an environmentally conscious, luxury residential and tourist destination. Together with the island's owner, the BVI government expects to establish a model for environmentally sustainable development. After planning and environmental approvals have met, the government hopes that the first phase of the project starts in the course of 2019. Footnotes External links * Norman Island B.V.I.

Cycling UK is registered at Companies House (as \\"Cyclists‚Äô Touring Club\\"), and covered by company law. It works at a national and local level to lobby for cyclists' needs and wants, provides services to members, and organises local groups for local activism and those interested in recreational cycling. The original Cyclists' Touring Club began in the nineteenth century with a focus on amateur road cycling but these days has a much broader sphere of interest encompassing everyday transport, commuting and many forms of recreational cycling. Prior to April 2016, the organisation operated under the brand \\"CTC, the national cycling charity\\". , the organisation's president is the newsreader Jon Snow. Present-day activities Cycling UK promotes cycling in the UK, and had 68,431 members . Its objectives (registered with the Charity Commission) are to: #\\"Promote community participation in healthy recreation by promoting the amateur sport of cycling, cycle touring and associated amateur sports; #\\"Preserve and protect the health and safety of the public by encouraging and facilitating cycling and the safety of cyclists; #\\"Advance education by whatever means [Cycling UK's] trustees think fit, including the provision of cycling, training and educational activities related to cycling; #\\"Promote the conservation and protection of the environment.\\" Cycling UK works to encourage more people to take up cycling, to make cycling safer and more enjoyable, and to provide cyclists with the support and resources they need. Its activities vary from road safety promotion to the provision of organised cycling holidays. Cycling UK does not focus on competitive cycle sport, since that has its own organisation, British Cycling. Cycling UK's successes have been a benchmarking project to spread best practice in cycle-friendly infrastructure design, and a grant of nearly ¬£1 million to promote national standards for cycle training, standards Cycling UK helped to develop. In 2015, Cycling UK received funding of ¬£1million for their social outreach project, the Big Bike Revival. The Big Bike Revival ran over the summer of 2015 and held over 1,600 events throughout England, benefiting over 50,000 people by \\"reviving\\" people's old bikes and giving them the skills and confidence to cycle more. The project was awarded a further ¬£500,000 by Cycling Minister Robert Goodwill in February 2016 to continue in summer 2016, and in June the Scottish Government awarded Cycling UK Scotland ¬£450,000 to bring the Big Bike Revival to Scotland. Cycling UK is organised at district level, with Local Groups organising cycle rides on Sundays and during the week. The more leisurely rides are planned around caf√© stops, the quality of the ride often being judged on the standard of the cakes. In 2008, the CTC Charitable Trust (formerly a part of the organisation charged with cycling development activities) launched the Cycle Champions programme. Using funding from the National Lottery's Wellbeing Fund, CTC employed 13 Community Cycling development Officers around England to promote cycling in all sectors of the community, particularly those not traditionally associated with cycling. They recruited 'Cycle Champions' within the community to work towards these goals as volunteers. In 2009, CTC, in partnership with ContinYou and UK Youth, launched Bike Club, a programme funded by Cycling England with the intention of promoting cycling, and its associated learning experiences, among children and young people aged 10‚Äì20. Locally based officers advised on the establishment of clubs and the application for funding. The members' magazine, Cycle, covers subjects including ride reports, product reviews and legal and technical advice. Members benefit from public liability insurance, which is extended to cover rides organised under the auspices of Cycling UK Local Groups. Cycling UK is also the organisation behind the British Cycle Quest, an informal competition which challenges members to visit six designated places in each of the counties of England, Scotland and Wales. Cycling UK is currently a member of the European Cyclists' Federation. Cycling UK believes that UK cyclists should continue to be free to decide whether or not they wear cycle helmets, and campaigns to keep the UK's laws as they are. Cycling UK says that this is because putting too much emphasis on cycle helmets makes people think that cycling is much more dangerous than it actually is, and can put people off. Cycling UK believes that health benefits of cycling far outweigh the risks, so it is important that people are not discouraged. Cycling UK also feels that the real risks faced by cyclists, such as excessive vehicle speed, are often forgotten when all the discussions concentrate on cycle helmets. Cycling UK reviewed the current Highway Code before it was published, and helped reword some sections that could have been detrimental for cyclists. Cycling UK is a founder of the Slower Speeds Initiative, an unincorporated association dedicated to reducing traffic speeds on all roads. CTC works with organisations such as Transport 2000 and Sustrans, and has charitable offshoots, the CTC Charitable Trust and the Cyclists' Defence Fund. History Old CTC sign on display at the National Museum of Scotland Cycling UK has been known by various names over the course of its history: *The Bicycle Touring Club (1878-1883) *The Cyclists' Touring Club (1883-2009, remains CTC's legal name)Annual report for the CTC Council for year ending 30 September 2009, page 2. Publishing in 'Cycle', Apr-May 2009. The change from \\"Bicycle\\" to \\"Cyclists'\\" emphasised the fact that the club was also open to tricyclists - adult tricycles enjoyed considerable popularity at the time. *CTC, the national cyclists' organisation (2009-2012) *CTC, the national cycling charity (2012-2016) *Cycling UK (2016-) 2016's branding change is intended to reflect the organisation's current activities and avoid placing an undue emphasis on its historic touring focus. =Foundation= Cycling UK was founded at Harrogate, in Yorkshire, on 5 August 1878 by an Edinburgh medical student, Stanley Cotterell, under its original name of the Bicycle Touring Club. It claims to be the oldest transport organisation in the world. Its headquarters were wherever Cotterell happened to be living. It had 80 members, all men. The first woman, Jeanie A Welford, joined in 1880. In 1883, the Bicycle Touring Club was renamed the Cyclists' Touring Club to open membership to tricyclists. Membership rose to 10,627 and CTC opened a headquarters at 139-140 Fleet Street in London.CTC website www.ctc.org.uk Members, like those of other clubs, often rode in uniform. CTC appointed an official tailor. The uniform was a dark green Devonshire serge jacket, knickerbockers and a \\"Stanley helmet with a small peak\\". The colour changed to grey when green proved impractical because it showed the dirt.Cycling On, Ray Hallett, Dinosaur Publications 1978 Groups often rode with a bugler at their head to sound changes of direction or to bring the group to a halt. Confusion could be caused when groups met and mistook each other's signals.John Pinkerton, int. Wheels of Fortune, BBC Radio 4, 1988 =Cycling accommodation= CTC plaque on the wall of a guest house in Ingleton, North Yorkshire 1895 cartoon contrasting the bicycle suit (left) vs. conventional feminine attire (right) From 1887, the Cyclists' Touring Club gave seals of approval, in the form of a cast iron plaque (later replaced by an enamel plate) showing the winged-wheel symbol of CTC, for mounting on an outside wall of hotels and restaurants which offered good accommodation and service to cyclists. A few of the metal signs still exist, as do a handful of road signs put up by CTC to warn cyclists of steep hills: usually steep going down, which was as much a problem for riders of large-wheel ordinaries, or \\"penny-farthings\\", as going up. The CTC no longer puts up general road signs--although the right to do so is retained-- and approved establishments are offered a plastic window-sticker carrying the blue and yellow logo shown above. In 1898 CTC became embroiled in a court case to defend a member denied what she thought adequate service at a hotel carrying the club's badge. Florence Wallace Pomeroy, Viscountess Harberton (1843‚Äì1911), of Cromwell Road, Kensington -- wife of James, 6th Viscount Harberton, an Anglo-Irish peer, and president of the Western Rational Dress Society -- cycled on the morning of 27 October 1898 to have lunch at the Hautboy Hotel in Ockham, Surrey. Lady Harberton's campaigning for society to accept that women could wear \\"rational\\" dress on a bicycle and not ankle- length dresses led her to wear a jacket and a pair of long and baggy trousers which came together just above the ankle. She walked into the coffee room and asked to be served. The landlady, a Mrs Martha Sprague, showed her instead into the bar parlour. CTC went into action, mounting a prosecution for \\"refusing food to a traveller\\". The landlady was acquitted and CTC lost the unusually large amount of money it had allotted to the case, which had been considered at the root of cyclists' rights and the values of CTC. =Attempt to include motorists= In 1906 CTC asked the High Court to amend its constitution so that it could admit all tourists, including car-drivers. A majority of members - 10,495 to 2,231 - had voted the previous year for the change to take place. The court ruled that CTC could not protect the interests of cyclists and drivers at the same time and denied permission.Penguin Book of the Bicycle, Roderick Watson and Martin Gray, 1984 =Delaying Segregated Cycle Paths= In 1926 the CTC discussed an unsuccessful motion calling for cycle tracks to be built on each side of roads for \\"the exclusive use of cyclists\\", and that cyclists could be taxed, providing the revenue was used for the provision of such tracks. The first (and one of the very few) dedicated roadside optional cycle tracks was built in 1934, as an experiment for the Ministry of Transport, located in London beside Western Avenue between Hanger Lane and Greenford Road. It was thought that \\"the prospect of cycling in comfort as well as safety would be appreciated by most cyclists themselves\\". However, the idea ran into trenchant opposition from cycling groups, with the CTC distributing pamphlets warning against the threat of cycle paths.The Perils of the Cycle Path, Cyclists Touring Club, 1935 Local CTC branches organised mass meetings to reject the use of cycle tracks and any suggestion that cyclists should be forced to use such devices.Notes from history and the Hull mass cyclist demonstration of 1935 by Howard Peel, The Bike Zone, The Thinking Cyclist, accessed 23 January 2007 In 1935, a packed general meeting of the CTC adopted a motion rejecting ministerial plans for cycle path construction. The CTC were listened to, and the use of cycle tracks largely fell out of favour in the UK until the early 1970s. In 1996 the UK Cyclists' Touring Club and the Institute of Highways and Transportation jointly produced a set of Cycle-Friendly Infrastructure guidelines that placed segregated cycling facilities at the bottom of the hierarchy of measures designed to promote cycling.Cycle-Friendly Infrastructure: Guidelines for Planning and Design, Institution of Highways and Transportation, Cyclists Touring Club, 1996. =Conversion to charity= In September 2012, the Cyclists' Touring Club was merged with the CTC Charitable Trust, forming a single charitable organisation. This followed approval by The Charity Commission for England and Wales in June 2012. It was stated that conversion to a single unified charity would result in financial savings, allow the income of CTC to be boosted by up to ¬£100,000 by reclaiming Gift Aid, and help to build public recognition and support. CTC members had voted overwhelmingly in favour of amending the CTC's Memorandum and Articles to enable the registration as a unified charity, with almost 9,000 members voting at the AGM, and 92.7% voting in favour. =Rebrand to Cycling UK= In April 2016, CTC rebranded to Cycling UK, following a poll of members. However many of the district groups are still known as \\"CTC\\".Central London CTC http://www.centrallondonctc.org.uk/whatwedo (and others) A poll was demanded of the entire club after the collection more than the required 200 signatures of CTC members a poll was instigated. The name was confirmed by the following: Total for poll = 10,227 that represents 15.26% of the membership. Total for CTC = 3,694 that represents 5.51% of the membership. Total for CTC = 36.12% of members who voted. Total for CUK = 6,533 that represents 9.75% of the membership. Total for CUK = 63.87% of members who voted.

Biography Manson was born in Piqua, Ohio, to David Manson, Jr., and Sarah Cornwall. He was a descendant of David Manson, an aide to Revolutionary War General George Washington. His family moved to Crawfordsville, Indiana. He was a school teacher in Montgomery County, Indiana. He studied medicine in Cincinnati, Ohio, and gave medical lectures in New Orleans. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War he served with the 5th Indiana Volunteers as a captain. He was a druggist in Crawfordsville, Indiana, and a member of the Indiana Legislature. At the beginning of the Civil War he was appointed a captain in the 10th Indiana Infantry and was promoted to colonel in less than a month. He commanded a brigade in the Army of the Ohio at the Battle of Mill Springs in 1862 and was promoted to brigadier general on March 24, 1862, based on his actions there. General Manson was wounded in the thigh and captured by Confederate forces at the Battle of Richmond, Kentucky. He was exchanged two months later and fought Morgan on his raid into Ohio. In the span of two months Manson advanced from brigade, to division and then to command the XXIII Corps. He led the corps during the Knoxville Campaign seeing action at Campbell's Station and Knoxville. General Manson returned to brigade command, in the Army of the Ohio, during the Atlanta Campaign and was seriously wounded in the Battle of Resaca, Georgia. After the war he served in the United States House of Representatives as a Democrat from 1871 to 1873, was state auditor, and the 20th Lieutenant Governor of Indiana from 1885‚Äì1886.

Dixon.  Biography  = Early life = The son of a school principal, McFarlane was raised in the town of Haileybury, Ontario. He became a freelance writer shortly after high school. He and his family moved to Whitby, Ontario, in 1936. This period is described in his 1975 book A Kid in Haileybury. = Journalist = As a young man he worked in Sudbury, Ontario, as a newspaper reporter, then for a weekly paper in Toronto, before taking a job at the Springfield Republican newspaper in Springfield, Massachusetts. = Stratemeyer Syndicate = While in the U.S., he replied to a want ad placed by the Stratemeyer Syndicate, publisher of such titles as Nancy Drew, Tom Swift and the Bobbsey Twins. As a result, he freelanced in 1926 and 1927 as one of the authors using the pseudonym Roy Rockwood to write seven of the Dave Fearless serialized mystery novels. The Hardy Boys This led to his involvement with the Hardy Boys, a project on which he was a large contributor, writing 19 of the first 25 books between 1927 and 1946, and 21 overall. He also wrote books in several other juvenile series, published in pulp magazines, novellas or novels over his fifty-year career, at one point writing six novels in one year. McFarlane earned as little as $85 per book during the Great Depression, yet he continued because he had a growing family. According to his son, McFarlane regarded the Hardy Boys books as a nuisance. \\"In his diaries, my father talks about having to write another of those nuisent books, in order to earn another $85 to buy coal for the furnace. And he never read them over afterward. It was only much later that he accepted plaudits for the work.\\" His daughter, Norah McFarlane Perez, said in an interview that \\"They'd give him an outline, but to make it palatable, he'd come up with different characters and add colour and use large words, and inject his wonderful sense of humour. And then he'd finish and say, 'I will never write another juvenile book.' But then the bills would pile up and he'd start another.\\" However, McFarlane was not bitter about not earning a cut of the enormous revenues generated by his work. \\"He was very philosophical about it. His attitude was, 'Look, I took these on and I was glad to get the deal.' There was no rancour,\\" according to his daughter. Nancy Drew, The Dana Girls McFarlane also wrote the first four volumes of The Dana Girls series for the Stratemeyer Syndicate under the pseudonym Carolyn Keene, which the Syndicate also used for the Nancy Drew series of books. Although there are claims that his last Hardy Boys book, The Phantom Freighter, was actually written by his wife Amy,\\"Remembering Hardy Boys author Leslie McFarlane,\\" CBC Radio his biographer Marilyn Greenwald concluded that this was unlikely. In his 1976 autobiography Ghost of the Hardy Boys, McFarlane says that The Phantom Freighter \\"was written in 1946 in motel rooms at night on a location in Nova Scotia when I was directing a film\\". = Film and television work = While still writing for the series for the Stratemeyer Syndicate, McFarlane returned to Canada to work for the National Film Board of Canada (NFB). As part of the NFB in Montreal, he wrote and directed documentaries and short dramas including the 1951 documentary Royal Journey, Here's Hockey, a 1953 documentary about ice hockey featuring Montreal Canadiens star Jean B√©liveau. He also wrote the documentary titled Herring Hunt, nominated for an Academy Award for Live Action Short Film. Moving to Toronto he wrote for CBC television and at the suggestion of his friend Lorne Greene.  Legacy  The Leslie McFarlane Public School in Whitby, Ontario, was named in his honor until it was demolished in early 2010 when it was deemed more expensive to repair than it would be to build a new structure.http://www.durhamregion.com/DurhamRegion/Article/1115903 His son, Brian McFarlane, is well known as a former commentator on Hockey Night in Canada. He was the subject of the 2004 book The Secret of the Hardy Boys: Leslie McFarlane and the Stratemeyer Syndicate by Marilyn Greenwald. In 2006, McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, acquired Leslie McFarlane's diaries, correspondence, and early material, along with first editions of The Secret of the Caves and The Tower Treasure. The university plans to acquire early first editions of all of McFarlane's books. The archive donated to McMaster is estimated to have a value of $150,000.

It is related to the Schubert cell decomposition of Grassmannians: see Weyl group for this. More generally, any group with a (B, N) pair has a Bruhat decomposition. Definitions *G is a connected, reductive algebraic group over an algebraically closed field. *B is a Borel subgroup of G *W is a Weyl group of G corresponding to a maximal torus of B. The Bruhat decomposition of G is the decomposition :G=BWB =\\\\coprod_{w\\\\in W}BwB of G as a disjoint union of double cosets of B parameterized by the elements of the Weyl group W. (Note that although W is not in general a subgroup of G, the coset wB is still well defined because the maximal torus is contained in B.)  Examples  Let G be the general linear group GLn of invertible n \\\\times n matrices with entries in some algebraically closed field, which is a reductive group. Then the Weyl group W is isomorphic to the symmetric group Sn on n letters, with permutation matrices as representatives. In this case, we can take B to be the subgroup of upper triangular invertible matrices, so Bruhat decomposition says that one can write any invertible matrix A as a product U1PU2 where U1 and U2 are upper triangular, and P is a permutation matrix. Writing this as P = U1‚àí1AU2‚àí1, this says that any invertible matrix can be transformed into a permutation matrix via a series of row and column operations, where we are only allowed to add row i (resp. column i) to row j (resp. column j) if i > j (resp. i < j). The row operations correspond to U1‚àí1, and the column operations correspond to U2‚àí1. The special linear group SLn of invertible n \\\\times n matrices with determinant 1 is a semisimple group, and hence reductive. In this case, W is still isomorphic to the symmetric group Sn. However, the determinant of a permutation matrix is the sign of the permutation, so to represent an odd permutation in SLn, we can take one of the nonzero elements to be ‚àí1 instead of 1. Here B is the subgroup of upper triangular matrices with determinant 1, so the interpretation of Bruhat decomposition in this case is similar to the case of GLn.  Geometry  The cells in the Bruhat decomposition correspond to the Schubert cell decomposition of Grassmannians. The dimension of the cells corresponds to the length of the word w in the Weyl group. Poincar√© duality constrains the topology of the cell decomposition, and thus the algebra of the Weyl group; for instance, the top dimensional cell is unique (it represents the fundamental class), and corresponds to the longest element of a Coxeter group. Computations The number of cells in a given dimension of the Bruhat decomposition are the coefficients of the q-polynomialThis Week's Finds in Mathematical Physics, Week 186 of the associated Dynkin diagram.

It generalizes the polar decomposition or singular value decomposition of matrices. Its history can be traced to the 1880s work of √âlie Cartan and Wilhelm Killing.  Cartan involutions on Lie algebras  Let \\\\mathfrak{g} be a real semisimple Lie algebra and let B(\\\\cdot,\\\\cdot) be its Killing form. An involution on \\\\mathfrak{g} is a Lie algebra automorphism \\\\theta of \\\\mathfrak{g} whose square is equal to the identity. Such an involution is called a Cartan involution on \\\\mathfrak{g} if B_\\\\theta(X,Y) := -B(X,\\\\theta Y) is a positive definite bilinear form. Two involutions \\\\theta_1 and \\\\theta_2 are considered equivalent if they differ only by an inner automorphism. Any real semisimple Lie algebra has a Cartan involution, and any two Cartan involutions are equivalent. = Examples = * A Cartan involution on \\\\mathfrak{sl}_n(\\\\mathbb{R}) is defined by \\\\theta(X)=-X^T, where X^T denotes the transpose matrix of X. * The identity map on \\\\mathfrak{g} is an involution. It is the unique Cartan involution of \\\\mathfrak{g} if and only if the Killing form of \\\\mathfrak{g} is negative definite or, equivalently, if and only if \\\\mathfrak{g} is the Lie algebra of a compact semisimple Lie group. * Let \\\\mathfrak{g} be the complexification of a real semisimple Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g}_0, then complex conjugation on \\\\mathfrak{g} is an involution on \\\\mathfrak{g}. This is the Cartan involution on \\\\mathfrak{g} if and only if \\\\mathfrak{g}_0 is the Lie algebra of a compact Lie group. * The following maps are involutions of the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{su}(n) of the special unitary group SU(n): *# The identity involution \\\\theta_1(X) = X, which is the unique Cartan involution in this case. *# Complex conjugation, expressible as \\\\theta_2 (X) = - X^T on \\\\mathfrak{su}(2). *# If n = p+q is odd, \\\\theta_3 (X) = \\\\begin{pmatrix} I_p & 0  0 & -I_q \\\\end{pmatrix} X \\\\begin{pmatrix} I_p & 0  0 & -I_q \\\\end{pmatrix}. The involutions (1), (2) and (3) are equivalent, but not equivalent to the identity involution since \\\\begin{pmatrix} I_p & 0  0 & -I_q \\\\end{pmatrix} otin \\\\mathfrak (n). *# If n = 2m is even, there is also \\\\theta_4 (X) = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & I_m  -I_m & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix} X^T \\\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & I_m  -I_m & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}.  Cartan pairs  Let \\\\theta be an involution on a Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g}. Since \\\\theta^2=1, the linear map \\\\theta has the two eigenvalues \\\\pm1. If \\\\mathfrak{k} and \\\\mathfrak{p} denote the eigenspaces corresponding to +1 and -1, respectively, then \\\\mathfrak{g} = \\\\mathfrak{k}+\\\\mathfrak{p}. Since \\\\theta is a Lie algebra automorphism, the Lie bracket of two of its eigenspaces is contained in the eigenspace corresponding to the product of their eigenvalues. It follows that : [\\\\mathfrak{k}, \\\\mathfrak{k}] \\\\subseteq \\\\mathfrak{k}, [\\\\mathfrak{k}, \\\\mathfrak{p}] \\\\subseteq \\\\mathfrak{p}, and [\\\\mathfrak{p}, \\\\mathfrak{p}] \\\\subseteq \\\\mathfrak{k}. Thus \\\\mathfrak{k} is a Lie subalgebra, while any subalgebra of \\\\mathfrak{p} is commutative. Conversely, a decomposition \\\\mathfrak{g} = \\\\mathfrak{k}+\\\\mathfrak{p} with these extra properties determines an involution \\\\theta on \\\\mathfrak{g} that is +1 on \\\\mathfrak{k} and -1 on \\\\mathfrak{p}. Such a pair (\\\\mathfrak{k}, \\\\mathfrak{p}) is also called a Cartan pair of \\\\mathfrak{g}, and (\\\\mathfrak{g},\\\\mathfrak{k}) is called a symmetric pair. This notion of a Cartan pair here is not to be confused with the distinct notion involving the relative Lie algebra cohomology H^*(\\\\mathfrak{g},\\\\mathfrak{k}). The decomposition \\\\mathfrak{g} = \\\\mathfrak{k}+\\\\mathfrak{p} associated to a Cartan involution is called a Cartan decomposition of \\\\mathfrak{g}. The special feature of a Cartan decomposition is that the Killing form is negative definite on \\\\mathfrak{k} and positive definite on \\\\mathfrak{p}. Furthermore, \\\\mathfrak{k} and \\\\mathfrak{p} are orthogonal complements of each other with respect to the Killing form on \\\\mathfrak{g}.  Cartan decomposition on the Lie group level  Let G be a non-compact semisimple Lie group and \\\\mathfrak{g} its Lie algebra. Let \\\\theta be a Cartan involution on \\\\mathfrak{g} and let (\\\\mathfrak{k},\\\\mathfrak{p}) be the resulting Cartan pair. Let K be the analytic subgroup of G with Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{k}. Then: * There is a Lie group automorphism \\\\Theta with differential \\\\theta at the identity that satisfies \\\\Theta^2=1. * The subgroup of elements fixed by \\\\Theta is K; in particular, K is a closed subgroup. * The mapping K\\\\times\\\\mathfrak{p} \\\\rightarrow G given by (k,X) \\\\mapsto k\\\\cdot \\\\mathrm{exp}(X) is a diffeomorphism. * The subgroup K contains the center Z_G of G, and K/Z_G is compact. * The subgroup K is the maximal subgroup of G that contains the center and for which K/Z_G is compact. The automorphism \\\\Theta is also called the global Cartan involution, and the diffeomorphism K\\\\times\\\\mathfrak{p} \\\\rightarrow G is called the global Cartan decomposition. If we write P=\\\\mathrm{exp}(\\\\mathfrak{p})\\\\subset G this says that the product map K\\\\times P \\\\rightarrow G is a diffeomorphism so G=KP. For the general linear group, X \\\\mapsto (X^{-1})^T is a Cartan involution. A refinement of the Cartan decomposition for symmetric spaces of compact or noncompact type states that the maximal Abelian subalgebras \\\\mathfrak{a} in \\\\mathfrak{p} are unique up to conjugation by K. Moreover, :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\mathfrak{p}= \\\\bigcup_{k\\\\in K} \\\\mathrm{Ad}\\\\, k \\\\cdot \\\\mathfrak{a}.} \\\\qquad\\\\text{and}\\\\qquad \\\\displaystyle{P= \\\\bigcup_{k\\\\in K} \\\\mathrm{Ad}\\\\, k \\\\cdot A.} where A = e^\\\\mathfrak{a}. In the compact and noncompact case the global Cartan decomposition thus implies :G = KAK, Geometrically the image of the subgroup A in G/K is a totally geodesic submanifold.  Relation to polar decomposition  Consider \\\\mathfrak{gl}_n(\\\\mathbb{R}) with the Cartan involution \\\\theta(X)=-X^T. Then \\\\mathfrak{k}=\\\\mathfrak{so}_n(\\\\mathbb{R}) is the real Lie algebra of skew-symmetric matrices, so that K=\\\\mathrm{SO}(n), while \\\\mathfrak{p} is the subspace of symmetric matrices. Thus the exponential map is a diffeomorphism from \\\\mathfrak{p} onto the space of positive definite matrices. Up to this exponential map, the global Cartan decomposition is the polar decomposition of a matrix. The polar decomposition of an invertible matrix is unique.

Non-Archimedean Iwasawa decomposition There is an analog to the above Iwasawa decomposition for a non-Archimedean field F: In this case, the group GL_n(F) can be written as a product of the subgroup of upper- triangular matrices and the (maximal compact) subgroup GL_n(O_F), where O_F is the ring of integers of F., Prop. 4.5.2 See also * Lie group decompositions * Root system of a semi-simple Lie algebra References * * Category:Lie groups ","title":"Iwasawa decomposition"},{"id":"1139167","title":"Wealth tax"},{"id":"1139171","text":"Ivorian may refer to: Country * Something of, from, or related to the country of C√¥te d'Ivoire * A person from C√¥te d'Ivoire, or of Ivorian descent (for information about the Ivorian people, see Demographics of C√¥te d'Ivoire and Culture of C√¥te d'Ivoire) ** Specified Persons List of Ivorians * Note that there is no language called \\"Ivorian\\" (for languages spoken in C√¥te d'Ivoire, see Languages of C√¥te d'Ivoire) Other *Ivorian stage, in British stratigraphy a stage in the lower Carboniferous Category:Language and nationality disambiguation pages Category:Demonyms ","title":"Ivorian"},{"id":"1139175","text":"Lola Violeta Ana-Maria Bobesco (9 August 1921‚Äì 4 September 2003) was a Belgian violinist of Romanian origin. She was born in Craiova, Romania, and began her career as a child prodigy, giving her first recital there at the age of 6 with her father, composer and conductor Aurel Bobesco. She continued her studies at the Ecole Normale Musique de Paris (1928‚Äì1935) with Marcel Chailley (violin), and at the Conservatoire de Paris (1931‚Äì1935) with Jules Bucher, where she gained her first prize in 1934, and graduated with the \\"Prix d'Excellence.\\" She took private violin lessons with George Enescu and Jacques Thibaud. She became known internationally after appearing in Paris (1936) aged 17 with the Colonne Orchestra under the baton of Paul Paray, where she performed a concerto by Romanian composer Stan Golestan. The following year, 1937, she obtained the seventh prize at the Eug√®ne Ysa√øe contest. Although established abroad even before the end of World War II, she returned to Romania and regularly appeared in concerts with the Radio Philharmonic in Bucharest, and the provinces in Craiova, Brasov, Iasi, Timi»ôoara. She founded two musical groups in Belgium: in 1958, the Orchestre Royal de Chambre de Wallonie in Li√®ge; and in 1990, the string quartet L'Arte del Suono in Brussels. She was also a professor at the French-language Conservatoire royal de Bruxelles and professor of violin at the Conservatory of Li√®ge (1962‚Äì1974). She was on the jury of the Queen Elizabeth Competition in 1971 and 1993. She recorded sonatas of Ludwig van Beethoven, Gabriel Faur√©, Johannes Brahms, C√©sar Franck and Claude Debussy, and also baroque music including concertos by Johann Sebastian Bach. She also worked with major orchestral ensembles of the world, including: Berlin and London Philharmonics, French orchestra Colonne, Lamoureux and Pas de loup, Concertgebouw Orchestra (Amsterdam), La Suisse Romande (Geneva), and the Orchestra Accademia Santa Cecilia (Rome). At concert and chamber music recitals, she was often accompanied by pianist Jacques Genty. A violinist of exceptional artistic force in spite of her delicate physique, Bobesco balanced technical virtuosity with simplicity and interpretative austerity. Purity of lyrical expression, clear intonation, warm communicative musical phrasing, and originality of conception put her among the top international female performers. She recorded for Decca, Columbia, Les Discophiles Fran√ßais, Nippon Program Arcophon, and others. She died in Spa, Belgium. Her violin was a G.B Guadagnini with a beautiful and rich tone. The street 'Rue Lola Bobesco' that encircles behind the cultural centre at the Brussels commune of Woluwe-Saint- Lambert, is named after her.

The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 1966 Atlantic hurricane season, Faith developed from an area of disturbed weather between Cape Verde and the west coast of Africa on August 21\\\\. Tracking westward, the depression gradually intensified and became Tropical Storm Faith on the following day. Moving westward across the Atlantic Ocean, it continued to slowly strengthen, reaching hurricane status early on August 23\\\\. About 42 hours later, Faith reached an initial peak with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), before weakening slightly on August 26\\\\. Located near the Lesser Antilles, the outer bands of Faith produced gale force winds in the region, especially Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Antigua. Minor coastal damage occurred as far south as Trinidad and Tobago. By August 28, the storm began to re-intensify, after curving north-northwestward near The Bahamas. At 0000 UTC on the following day, Faith peaked as a 125 mph (205 km/h) Category 3 hurricane Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale. Eventually, the storm weakened back to a Category 2 hurricane and re-curved to the northeast. One person drowned in the western Atlantic after his ship sank. Heavy rainfall and strong winds pelted Bermuda, though no damage occurred. The storm maintained nearly the same intensity as a Category 2 hurricane for several days, while tracking northeastward into the far North Atlantic Ocean. Faith finally weakened while north of Great Britain and became extratropical near the Faroe Islands on September 6\\\\. Three other drowning deaths occurred in the North Sea near Denmark. A fifth death occurred after a man succumbed to injuries sustained during a boating incident related to the storm. Meteorological history Television Infrared Observation Satellite XI (TIROS XI) imagery indicated the presence of an area of disturbed weather over Ivory Coast on August 18\\\\. The system moved slowly westward and eventually reached the Atlantic Ocean. It is estimated that a tropical depression developed at 0000 UTC on August 21, while located about southeast of Cape Verde. Continuing westward, the depression intensified, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Faith on the following day. Gradual intensification persisted as Tropical Storm Faith headed nearly due westward at . By August 23, Faith was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane. Curving slightly west-northwestward, the storm reached Category 2 intensity and briefly peaked at sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). Hurricane Faith curved to the northwest and weakened back to a Category 1 hurricane while approaching the northeastern Leeward Islands on August 25\\\\. Initially, Faith was scheduled to be seeded as part of Project Stormfury. However, the scheduled seeding was cancelled as Faith was approaching The Bahamas. Bypassing the Leeward Islands, Faith remained at nearly the same intensity, until re-strengthening into Category 2 hurricane on August 28, near Turks and Caicos Islands. The storm quickly intensified further into a Category 3 hurricane only six hours later. Nimbus 2 satellite image of the precursor to Faith on August 20, emerging off the west coast of Africa At 00:00 UTC on August 29, Faith attained its maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h). After reaching maximum sustained winds late on August 29, Faith began to gradually weaken and decreased to Category 2 hurricane intensity early on August 30\\\\. By that time, the storm turned to the northeast around the periphery of an Atlantic subtropical anticyclone while located about midway between Bermuda and Florida. Faith remained well offshore of the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada, after veering eastward on September 1\\\\. Thereafter, it began to accelerate and eventually curved northeastward. While approaching Europe, Faith's forward speed increased to as much as 50 mph (75 km/h). At 0600 UTC on September 3, a minimum barometric pressure of was recorded - the lowest in relation to the storm. After remaining a Category 2 hurricane since August 29, Faith weakened slightly to a Category 1 hurricane early on September 6, as it neared the Faroe Islands. Crossing the North Sea, Faith finally transitioned into an extratropical storm at 1200 UTC later that day, while centered about 125 miles (200 km) east-northeast of T√≥rshavn. The extratropical remnants of Faith headed eastward and affected Norway with winds as high as 60 mph (95 km/h). Tracking over Scandinavia, the extratropical storm weakened to the equivalent of a tropical depression before entering the Soviet Union (present day Russia). Eventually, the storm degenerated into an extratropical low pressure area, curved northward, and retained its identity until September 15, when it was over Franz Josef Land, which is roughly 600 miles (965 km) from the North Pole. Impact and records Track map of Hurricane Faith as an extratropical cyclone In the Leeward Islands, the approach of Faith caused the tracking station on Antigua - which was monitoring an unmanned rocket launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) - to shut down 45 minutes after the rocket lifted off. Faith also produced gale force winds across Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, though only minor damage and no fatalities or injuries were reported. Further south, Faith brought rough seas to Trinidad and Tobago, with waves ranging from . These conditions inflicted minor damage to small boats and jetties. In the Turks and Caicos Islands, sea defenses suffered some damage as Faith passed about 65 miles (105 km) to the east-northeast. Along the East Coast of the United States, the storm produced rough seas and high tides from Cape Canaveral (then Cape Kennedy), Florida, to the Virginia Capes. Additionally, the Weather Bureau warned of possible gale force winds in The Carolinas and Virginia, but also noted that the area would only experience fringe effects from the storm. In Bermuda, the outer rainbands of Hurricane Faith produced heavy rainfall and wind gusts up to . Five people died as a result of the storm, though only one of them on land. Rough seas in the western Atlantic battered the Alberto Benati, pitching one man overboard. Two others drowned near Denmark while attempting to cross the Atlantic Ocean in a rowboat. Another man was missing and presumed dead after heavy seas forced him and his shipmates to abandon their boat off the northern coast of Denmark. Property damage was minimal, mainly because the areas impacted by Faith were sparsely populated. A 2,726 ton Norwegian car ferry known as Skagerak began to sink as it headed for Hirtshals in Region Nordjylland of Denmark. Waves pounded the side hatches, which flooded in the engine room, causing the ship to become disabled. A large-scale search operation was conducted to rescue the 144 passengers aboard. All passengers were rescued and treated for their injuries in Hj√∏rring, Denmark. However, one person later died in the hospital. In Norway, the remnants of Faith impacted areas between Ryfylke and Sunnfjord. The storm brought heavy rainfall and resulted in glacier melting, which in turn caused rampant flooding in some locations. Discharge from the Folgefonna, Fj√¶rland, and Sunnfjord glaciers reached a record high melt due to the remnants of Faith. Throughout its duration, Faith traveled for , making it the longest track of an Atlantic hurricane and the second longest worldwide, after Hurricane John in 1994 in the Eastern Pacific Ocean. Faith also traveled to the northernmost latitude of any Atlantic tropical cyclone, reaching as far north as 61.1¬∞N.

The Nuba Mountains are labeled in Southern Kordofan The Nuba Mountains, also referred to as the Nuba Hills (), is an area located in South Kordofan, Sudan. The area is home to a group of indigenous ethnic groups known collectively as the Nuba peoples. In the Middle Ages, the Nuba mountains probably had been part of the Nubian kingdom of Alodia. In the 18th century, they became home to the kingdom of Taqali that controlled the hills of the mountains until their defeat by Mahdi Muhammad Ahmad. After the Mahdi's defeat by the British, Taqali was restored as a client state. Infiltration of the Messiria tribe of Baggara Arabs has been influential in modern conflicts. Up to 1.5 million people live in the mountains mostly ethnic Nuba and small minority of Baggara. Geography The mountains cover an area roughly 64 km wide by 145 km long (40 by 90 miles), and are 450 to 900 meters (1,500 to 3,000 feet) higher in elevation than the surrounding plain. The mountains stretch for some 48,000 square kilometers (19,000 square miles). The climate is tropical, hot semi-arid with 300 to 800 mm of rain per year on average, but lush and green compared with most nearby areas. There are almost no roads in the Nuba Mountains; most villages there are connected by ancient paths that cannot be reached by motor vehicle. The rainy season extends from mid-May to mid-October, and annual rainfall ranges from 300 to 800 millimeters, allowing grazing animals and seasonal rain-fed agriculture. Political status The region stayed under the control of the central government and the Comprehensive Peace Agreement did not give the Nuba Mountains the right to join South Sudan in its vote for independence in 2011. Residents of the Nuba Mountains were required to hold ill-defined \\"popular consultations\\" to determine their future.Will Sudan's Nuba Mountains be left high and dry? by Peter Martell, BBC News, 24 November 2009SUDAN: The Nuba Mountains - straddling the north-south divide, IRIN, 12 November 2009 Not only the Nuba Mountains but the whole of South Kordofan state would be eligible to vote, essentially to accommodate the Messiria. Additionally, the Sudanese government maintained a heavy military presence in the region and even prospective \\"popular consultations\\" were seen likely to be barred. The ambiguous situation and fears of future communal violence invoked concerns that South Kordofan could be the \\"next Darfur\\".Sudan's Southern Kordofan Problem: The Next Darfur?, International Crisis Group report, 21 October 2008The Daily Telegraph: \\"New war in Sudan's Nuba mountains?\\" November 4, 2009.BBC: \\"Sudan: Could Nuba mountains be next conflict?\\" May 10, 2011 As of June 2011, South Kordofan's governor Ahmed Haroun had suspended the process of popular consultations and conflict between Sudan People's Armed Forces and Nuba fighters of the SPLM-N followed (see Sudan‚ÄìSPLM-N conflict (2011)). The war in Sudan began in 1983 until the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) signed on 9 January 2005 with independence vote set for 9 July 2011-the vote on 9 July 2011 succeeded the south into Africa's newest country, the Republic of South Sudan. The capital is located in Juba. The Nuba Mountains are geographically in the north in the area called South Kordofan (see Wikipedia for in-depth review). The people of the Nuba Mountains (a five mountain chain rising from the desert to 1,000 metres (3,000 feet)) were not aligned with the north under sharia law nor the Arabic language. This cultural dispute was in part the reason for people in Nuba being prosecuted by indiscriminate bombing, attacks on civilians and mines at entry points to the Nuba Mountains. Samuel Totten described the campaign of the Sudanese government in the Nuba Mountains as a \\"genocide by attrition\\" using starvation as a tool of extermination. In 2002, due to the extreme starvation of the people of the Nuba Mountains and under the international pressure from the UN, Khartoum under President Bashir (at that time, the government was termed the National Islamic Front) authorizes an interim cease fire to provide food and medical equipment/support to the people of the Nuba Mountains. In exchange, the Sudan People's Liberation Army/SPLA agree not attack the south-north pipeline to Port Sudan on the Red Sea coast. An international group of observers/advisers deployed to South Kordofan Province/Kadugli with several US advisers deployed directly into the Nuba Mountains, specifically to be co-located with the SPLA. One of the advisers/observers was Randolph Hampton (US) located in Kauda co-located with the SPLA command element. Reports of indiscriminate bombing of civilians and mining entry points primarily for relief operation was reported and documents (with photos) during this time. Abdel Aziz Adam El Hilu was at that time, the governor of the Nuba Mountains and former military leader for the SPLA. He is currently (as of March 2012) back in the Nuba Mountains supporting relief and security operations. The international community, including a number of celebrities such as actor George Clooney and reporter Nicholas Kristof,A rain of bombs in the Nuba have recently travelled to the Nuba Mountains and documented the continued genocidal activities of the Bashir government. President Bashir is an indicted war criminal at the International Criminal Court (ICC) as a result of the genocidal activities of Sudan in Darfur. Human Rights Watch says that cluster bombs are used in the region.

This classification suits most heroes of a number of traditional folk tales, including \\"Snow White\\", \\"Sleeping Beauty\\", and \\"Cinderella\\", even if in the original story they were given another name, or no name at all. Often handsome and romantic, these characters are essentially interchangeable, serving as a foil to the heroine; in many variants, they can be viewed as a metaphor for a reward the heroine achieves for the decisions she makes.Orenstein, Catherine (2002). Little Red Riding Hood Uncloaked: Sex, Morality, and the Evolution of a Fairy Tale. New York: Basic Books. . p. 121. The prominence of the character type makes him an obvious target for revisionist fairy tales. \\"Prince Charming\\" is also used as a term to refer to the idealized man some people dream of as a future spouse. History of term Charles Perrault's version of Sleeping Beauty, published in 1697, includes the following text at the point where the princess wakes up: \\"'Est-ce vous, mon prince?' lui dit-elle, 'vous vous √™tes bien fait attendre'. Le Prince charm√© de ces paroles... ne savait comment lui t√©moigner sa joie\\". (\\"'Are you my prince?' she said. 'You've kept me waiting a long time'. The prince charmed by her words... did not know how to express his joy.\\") It has sometimes been suggested that this passage later inspired the term, \\"Prince Charming\\", even though it is the prince who is charmed (charm√©) here, not who is being charming (charmant). In the 17th century, Madame d'Aulnoy wrote two fairy tales, The Story of Pretty Goldilocks, where the hero was named Avenant (\\"Fine\\", \\"Beautiful\\", in French), and The Blue Bird, where the hero was Le roi Charmant (\\"The Charming King\\"). When Andrew Lang retold the first (in 1889) for The Blue Fairy Book, he rendered the hero's name as \\"Charming\\"; the second, for The Green Fairy Book, as \\"King Charming\\". Although neither one was a prince and the first was not royal, this may have been the original use of \\"Charming\\". Walter Crane, Prince Charming in the Forest, NGA 65745 Then, Oscar Wilde's 1890 novel The Picture of Dorian Gray refers ironically to \\"Prince Charming\\", perhaps the earliest use of the exact term. The main character, Dorian, is supposed to be a young actress's \\"Prince Charming\\", but he abandons her and in despair she commits suicide. In the early Disney animated feature, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), when Snow White tells the dwarfs about her prince, she says, \\"Anyone could see that the prince was charming, the only one for me.\\" However, he is never referred to specifically as \\"Prince Charming\\". Andreas Deja initially struggled with the concept of animating a handsome villain in Beauty and the Beast. Deja ultimately based Gaston's appearance on those of handsome soap opera actors in order to create a grotesque version of the Prince Charming stock character. In other languages, like Spanish and Italian, he is called the \\"Blue Prince\\". In Portuguese, a translation mistake occurred and he is called \\"Charmed Prince\\" (Pr√≠ncipe Encantado; the correct term for \\"Charming\\" should be Encantador or Charmoso), coincidentally closer to the sense in Perrault's story mentioned atop this section. Modern usage *The Broadway musical Into the Woods (first produced in 1986) explores the character as polygamous, and where there are not one, but two Prince Charmings. Here, they are shown as brothers pursuing Cinderella and Rapunzel, then later, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White, after they have married their first wenches. Cinderella's Prince has an affair with the baker's wife as well, and when confronted about his womanizing, states \\"I was raised to be charming, not sincere.\\" In the 2014 Disney film adaptation of Into the Woods, Prince Charming is portrayed by Chris Pine. * As implied by the title, the 1991 fantasy novel Bring Me the Head of Prince Charming by Roger Zelazny and Robert Sheckley includes sharp satire of the traditional fairy tale theme. *Prince Charming is a prominent character in the Fables comic book (2002‚Äì2015). Polygamy is explored again: in that version, he successively married Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella with each marriage ending in divorce due to his compulsive womanizing. He himself comments: \\"I always truly love a woman when I first pursue her...I'm just no good at the happily-ever-after part.\\" He parlays his charm into election as the mayor of Fabletown, the underground \\"Fable\\" community, and finds the job more difficult than he had anticipated. He died in the Battle for the Homelands by activating a bomb to End the War. *The character of Prince Charming is deconstructed in the 2004 movie Shrek 2 and its 2007 follow-up Shrek the Third, wherein he is the son of the Fairy Godmother and has an unpleasant and ruthless personality unfitting for a fairy-tale prince. *In the fantasy novel series The Sisters Grimm (2005‚Äì2012), Prince Charming is the mayor of Ferryport Landing, a town inhabited by fairy-tale characters- or everafters. He is shown to be rude, arrogant and boastful, but turns out to be a valuable ally to the protagonists of the series. He is shown to have married and slept with many of the girls in this town, among them Cinderella, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty. But he clarifies that he truly loves Snow White and proposes to her. He then separates himself from her for her protection. *The concept of the Prince Charming is parodied in the 2007 film Enchanted when Edward is looking for Princess Giselle in the New York City. While knocking the doors he finds a pregnant housewife holding three kids, who tells him, in a scoffing voice, \\"You're too late.\\" *In the television series Once Upon a Time (2011‚Äì2017), Prince Charming is David Nolan (portrayed by Josh Dallas), the husband of Snow White, though neither of them remembers this in Storybrooke, where the character's name is David Nolan (\\"Charming\\" is the nickname given to him by Snow White). In his previous life, David is actually the brother of the real prince James (also portrayed by Josh Dallas) who died and was replaced with his twin. Both brothers were born to a poor farm couple who made a deal with Rumpelstiltskin to save their farm; they gave up one son to King George, whose wife could not conceive. After James's death his brother found out the truth and took his place, becoming engaged to Abigail, daughter of King Midas (reluctantly, after his family is threatened by the real prince's adoptive father) in a deal that unites two kingdoms with Midas giving the King George gold in exchange for the prince defeating a dragon. Later, the prince meets and marries Snow White with whom he has a daughter named Emma and finds out he has a grandson named Henry. In Storybrooke, David is a John Doe with amnesia who meets and falls for Mary Margaret, who is really Snow White, before recovering his memory and working at the Storybrooke Sheriff Department. He later has another child with Snow White named Neal. * A Charming Affair (c. 2011‚Äì2013 ) by Robert Scott (1984) is an 8-minute sketch published by Lazy Bee Scripts portraying Prince Charming as a bigamist. When Snow White, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty learn the truth, they plan to assassinate him with a poisoned apple. The sketch was performed in 2014 in Short and Sweet Theatre Festival by the American Theatre of Dubai, and the script became the Judges Award Winner. * In the book series The Land of Stories (2012) by Chris Colfer, there are four Prince Charmings, who are brothers. Three of them are married with Snow White, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty, the other is lost.

The chalk downland of the South Downs and southern edges of Salisbury Plain were settled in the neolithic, and these settlers built hill forts such as Winklebury and may have farmed the valleys of Hampshire. Hampshire was part of an Ancient British kingdom the Celts called Gwent (not be confused with the county in Wales) or Y Went, which also covered areas that would later belong to Somerset and Wiltshire). In the Roman invasion of Britain, Hampshire was one of the first areas to fall to the invading forces. During the period of Anglo-Saxon settlement, modern Hampshire and the Isle of Wight were occupied by Jutish tribes ‚Äì a people separate initially from the Saxons and Angles. Jutes founded kingdoms known as Wihtwara (Wight), Meonwara (Meon Valley) and Ytene (in an area similar to the later site of the New Forest). According to St Bede, however, the Jutes were conquered by the surrounding Saxon kingdoms during the 7th century. Hamtunscƒ´r (after Hamtun, the original name of Southampton) was one of the first Saxon shires to be recorded, in 755. For two centuries Hampshire represented the western frontier of Saxon England, as the Britons fought off advances into Dorset and Somerset. After the Saxons advanced west Hampshire became the centre of the Kingdom of Wessex, and many Saxon kings are buried at Winchester. A statue in Winchester celebrates the powerful King Alfred, who stabilised the region in the 9th century. After the Norman Conquest the county was favoured by Norman kings who established the New Forest as a hunting forest. The county was recorded in the Domesday Book divided into 44 hundreds. These later consolidated to 37. These were Alton, Andover, Barmanstip, Barton Stacey, Basingstoke, Bedbridge, Bondsborough, Bosmere, Buddlesgate, Christchurch, Chutely, Crondall, East Meon, Evinger, Fawley, Finchdean, Fordingbridge, Hambledon, Heling, Holdsett, King's Somborne, Kingsclere, Mansbridge, Meanstoke, Micheldever, New Forest, Odiham, Overton, Pastrow, Portsdown, Ringwood, Shelbourn, Sutton, Thorngate, Titchfield, Waltham and Wherwell. Over several centuries a series of castles and forts were constructed along the coast of the Solent to defend the harbours at Southampton and Portsmouth. These include the Norman Portchester Castle which overlooks Portsmouth Harbour, and a series of forts built by Henry VIII including Hurst Castle, situated on a sand spit at the mouth of the Solent, Calshot Castle on another spit at the mouth of Southampton Water, and Netley Castle. Southampton and Portsmouth remained important harbours when rivals, such as Poole and Bristol declined, as they are amongst the few locations that combine shelter with deep water. Southampton has been host to many famous ships, including the Mayflower and the Titanic, the latter being crewed largely by Hampshire natives. Hampshire played a large role in World War II due to its large Royal Navy harbour at Portsmouth, the army camp at Aldershot and the military Netley Hospital on Southampton Water, as well as its proximity to the army training ranges on Salisbury Plain and the Isle of Purbeck. Supermarine, the designers of the Spitfire and other military aircraft, were based in Southampton, which led to severe bombing of the city. Aldershot remains one of the British Army's main permanent camps. The county has in the past been called \\"Southamptonshire\\" and appears as such on some Victorian maps. The name of the administrative county was changed from 'County of Southampton' to 'County of Hampshire' on 1 April 1959. The short form of the name, often used in postal addresses, is Hants. The old name appears as the place of embarkation of many of the immigrants into Ellis Island. It is recorded in the 'Commonwealth Instrument of Government, 1653, which was adopted by Oliver Cromwell when he assumed the office of 'Lord Protector' in 1654. The Isle of Wight has been for some purposes in the past treated traditionally part of Hampshire, but has been administered separately from Hampshire for over a century, obtaining a county council of its own in 1890. The Isle of Wight became a full ceremonial county in 1974. The island is excluded from the hundreds given above ‚Äì it was traditionally divided into East Medina and West Medina hundreds. Apart from a shared police force there are now no formal administrative links between the Isle of Wight and Hampshire. The towns of Bournemouth and Christchurch also fall within the historic county of Hampshire.

College career Born in Columbus, Ohio, Taylor grew up in Irvine, California and played college soccer at UCLA from 2000 to 2003. Taylor was mostly a substitute his first year, but earned a larger role as a sophomore, finishing the season with seven goals and two assists. As a junior, he bettered that, registering 12 goals and eight assists, while being an important part of a UCLA team that won the NCAA Championship. Taylor's senior season was his best, as he scored 14 goals and had 8 assists, was named the Pac-10 Player of the Year, and was a Hermann Trophy finalist. Taylor was the nation's leading scorer in the NCAA tournament during UCLA's championship run in 2002 and was named to the all tournament team at the college cup. Taylor is also the all-time leading scorer for UCLA in post season tournament play. During his college years he played several games alongside former German National Team player J√ºrgen Klinsmann with Orange County Blue Star in the USL Premier Development League. Professional career An excellent MLS Combine saw the Kansas City Wizards trade up to draft him 4th overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft. Although stuck behind Davy Arnaud and Josh Wolff and receiving little playing time in 2003, Taylor showed his scoring acumen registering three goals and an assist in only 524 minutes from a substitute's role. After his first season, Taylor was left unprotected for the 2004 MLS Expansion Draft, and was selected 8th overall by Chivas USA. He became one of the few non-Hispanics on the squad. Taylor was Chivas USA's first ever player to be named MLS player of the week. Taylor's first four years in MLS were hampered by injuries including a broken tibia, and double hernia surgery. Taylor became a first eleven player for Chivas USA coach Hans Westerhof and responded by leading all offensive categories in a starter's role. Taylor just started to regain the speed and quickness to match his work rate when he decided to leave Chivas USA over a contract dispute with then coach Preki. On July 25, 2007, Taylor signed for Portland Timbers. He had a short stint at the amateur side Hollywood United in the Los Angeles-based USASA-affiliated Coast Soccer League, where he scored two goals on penalty kicks against his former club the Portland Timbers in the first round of the 2008 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, helping Hollywood to a shocking 3-2 win over the USL side. On August 14, 2008, Taylor moved to TuS Koblenz, then playing in the Germany's second tier 2. Fu√üball-Bundesliga just three days before their season started and scored in his first game for the team. On October 5, 2008, he scored a hat trick for Koblenz in a 5-0 win over Kaiserslautern. On May 27, 2009 Taylor signed a two-year contract with FSV Frankfurt, but left for 3. Liga club Rot Weiss Ahlen after playing only on year for FSV. Taylor moved to Preu√üen M√ºnster for the 2012/13 3. Liga season after playing the 2011/12 season with SC Paderborn 07 in the 2. Bundesliga. Two years later he signed for 1. FC Saarbr√ºcken.

Cavalcade of Stars Gleason's first variety series, which aired on the DuMont Television Network under the title Cavalcade of Stars, first aired June 4, 1949. The show's first host was comedian Jack Carter, who was followed by Jerry Lester. After Lester quit in June 1950 (soon to become the star of NBC's first late-night series, Broadway Open House), Gleason‚Äîwho had made his mark on the first television incarnation of The Life of Riley sitcom‚Äîstepped into Cavalcade on July 15, 1950 and became an immediate sensation. The show was broadcast live in front of a theater audience, and offered the same kind of vaudevillian entertainment common to early television revues. Gleason's guests included New York-based performers of stage and screen, including Bert Wheeler, Smith and Dale, Patricia Morison, and Vivian Blaine. Production values were modest, owing to DuMont's humble facilities and a thrifty sponsor (Quality Drugs, representing most of the nation's drug stores). In 1952, CBS president William S. Paley offered Gleason a considerably higher salary. The series was retitled The Jackie Gleason Show and premiered on CBS Television on September 20, 1952. Paley used the show's position on CBS to showcase artists like Frankie Laine, Frankie Avalon, Doris Day, and the teenage guitar prodigy Zane Ashton. In 1953, CBS' own orchestral accordionist John Serry Sr. made a cameo appearance. While much of DuMont's programming archive was destroyed after they ceased broadcasting, a surprising number of Cavalcade of Stars episodes survive, including several episodes at the UCLA Film and Television Archive. Additionally, at least 14 Gleason episodes survive at the Paley Center for Media. In his book The Forgotten Network, author David Weinstein mentions an unusual aspect of the DuMont network. He notes that while Drug Store Productions was technically the sponsor, they in turn sold the commercial air time to various companies and products. Weinstein notes this as an early example of U.S. network television moving away from the single- sponsor system typical of the early 1950s. He quotes former DuMont executive Ted Bergmann describing the DuMont version as featuring six commercial breaks during the hour, with each break comprising a single one-minute commercial. Format The show typically opened with a monologue from Gleason, followed by sketch comedy involving Gleason and a number of regular performers (including Art Carney) and a musical interlude featuring the June Taylor Dancers. (Taylor later became Gleason's sister-in-law; he married her sister Marilyn in 1975.) Gleason portrayed a number of recurring characters, including: *supercilious, mustachioed playboy millionaire Reginald Van Gleason III (Gleason's personal favorite)\\"The Great Drunkard\\" *friendly Joe the Bartender *loudmouthed braggart Charlie Bratten *Rum Dum, a hapless dipsomaniac with a walrus mustache *mild-mannered Fenwick Babbitt *The Bachelor who was forever unmarried *bombastic Rudy the Repairman *a put-upon character known only as the Poor Soul, whom Gleason performed in pantomime. *Stanley R. Sogg, late-night movie pitchman for Mother Fletcher's products (\\"No-Cal Chicken Fat\\") *blowhard Brooklyn bus driver Ralph Kramden The series was a big hit for CBS, finishing at #8 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1953-1954 season and #2 in 1954-1955. The Jackie Gleason Show also earned Emmy nominations for best variety series in 1953, 1954 and 1955, for Gleason as best star in 1954 and 1955, for Audrey Meadows as best supporting actress in 1954 and 1957, Art Carney for best supporting actor in 1957, June Taylor for best choreography in 1956, and best writing and best engineering effects in 1955. The series won Emmys for Meadows as best supporting actress in 1955, Carney as best supporting actor in 1954 and 1955, and Taylor for choreography in 1955. Gleason never received an Emmy. The Honeymooners Gleason and Audrey Meadows as Ralph and Alice Kramden, 1956. By far the most memorable and popular of Gleason's characters was blowhard Brooklyn bus driver Ralph Kramden, featured originally in a series of Cavalcade skits known as \\"The Honeymooners\\", with Pert Kelton as his wife Alice, and Art Carney as his upstairs neighbor Ed Norton. These were so popular that in 1955 Gleason suspended the variety format and filmed The Honeymooners as a regular half- hour sitcom (television's first spin-off), co-starring Carney, Audrey Meadows (who had replaced the blacklisted Kelton after the earlier move to CBS), and Joyce Randolph. Finishing 19th in the ratings, these 39 episodes were subsequently rerun constantly in syndication, often five nights a week, with the cycle repeating every two months for decades. They are probably the most familiar body of work from 1950s television with the exception of I Love Lucy starring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. The show's original variety format and title returned in September 1956 and continued until June 1957. Then, in October 1958, Gleason debuted a half-hour version of The Jackie Gleason Show, with Buddy Hackett as a sidekick, but it was short-lived, cancelled in January 1959. The Jackie Gleason Show (1961 revision) In 1961, Gleason began an ill-fated stint as host of a game show called You're in the Picture, which lasted only one episode, and was so poorly received that it led to Gleason offering an on-air apology to his viewers the following week. Committed to filling a quota of episodes, Gleason renamed the series The Jackie Gleason Show and turned it into a short-lived talk show, featuring one-on-one informal interviews with Art Carney, Jayne Mansfield, Bobby Darin, and other friends and celebrities. It ran for eight episodes. American Scene Magazine, 1962‚Äì1965 In 1962, Gleason returned to the tried-and-true variety format with his American Scene Magazine. The official title of the show was, again, The Jackie Gleason Show. In its first year, Gleason's ratings killed the competition: A revived comedy-western-variety program, The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Show, on ABC and the legal drama Sam Benedict with Edmond O'Brien on NBC. Photo postcard in response to ticket requests after The Jackie Gleason Show moved to Miami. Note a very tanned Gleason. American Scene was initially taped in New York City; after two seasons, production moved to Miami Beach (1964), on Jackie's insistence. (This caused difficulties for announcer Johnny Olson, who had several other announcing jobs; Olson commuted frequently between New York City and Miami to accommodate Gleason.) Gleason would begin his monologue each week and be surprised by the flamboyant jackets worn by bandleader Sammy Spear. (Beholding Spear's animal-print blazer, Gleason quipped, \\"I've heard of Tiger Rag, but this is ridiculous!\\") Ralph Kramden, Reggie Van Gleason, the Poor Soul, and the rest of Gleason's comic characters were regular attractions. Frank Fontaine, as bug-eyed, grinning \\"Crazy\\" Guggenheim, starred in the Joe the Bartender skits, delighting fans with his nutty speaking voice and goofy laugh, and charmed by his surprisingly mellow singing voice. June Taylor's chorus girl routines revived for the television generation the aerial pattern kaleidoscope formations made famous on film by Busby Berkeley. During this time, Gleason's show finished #17 for the 1962-1963 season, #15 for 1963-1964, #21 in 1964-1965 and #24 in 1965-1966. The Jackie Gleason Show ‚Äì 1966 In fall 1966, the show title reverted to simply The Jackie Gleason Show (dropping the American Scene format), and would remain so until its cancellation in 1970. By this point episodes included guest stars and skits. A component during this period was the musical Honeymooners episodes, which had first been tried on Gleason's variety show during the 1956-1957 season. These were later collected as The Color Honeymooners, with Sheila MacRae and Jane Kean as Alice and Trixie, respectively. The regular cast included Art Carney; Milton Berle was a frequent guest star. The show was shot in color on videotape at the Miami Beach Auditorium (today called the Fillmore at the Jackie Gleason Theatre), and Gleason never tired of promoting the \\"sun and fun capital of the world\\" on camera. Hordes of vacationers took Gleason's advice, boosting Florida's economy. Later specials were taped at the Olympia Theatre's Gusman Center across Biscayne Bay in downtown Miami. The shows began with the television camera in front of a boat speeding toward the shore of Miami Beach, and ended with Gleason bellowing, \\"Miami Beach audiences are the greatest audiences in the world!\\" During this period, The Jackie Gleason Show earned three more Emmy nominations, for Carney for special classification in 1966 and for variety series and writing in 1967. Carney won two Emmys for his work in 1967 and 1968. The series also ranked at No. 5 in 1966-1967 and No. 9 in 1967-1968. At the end of the 1968‚Äì1969 season, The Jackie Gleason Show still garnered decent ratings, ranking at No. 25 in the Nielsens and CBS renewed it for an eighth season. The following year would bring a radical change to the series: Gleason went on a stringent diet in 1969 and lost approximately 60 pounds. When the show returned in September 1969, there was much publicity about Gleason's new slimmer look. To gracefully incorporate his weight loss into the show, it was explained that Ralph Kramden also had gone on a diet and lost weight. This change proved to be somewhat of a detriment ‚Äì especially since Carney had gained weight. Jokes about Kramden's weight had been a strong component of humor for the Honeymooners sketches. A skinnier Ralph did not seem as funny to viewers and the overall ratings for the program began to slip. Coupled with the fact that the CBS network was concerned with demographics and wanted to change its image with more urban-oriented shows (to attract younger, more affluent audiences). In addition, CBS wanted Gleason to do only the hour-long Honeymooners and drop the variety episodes that garnered lower ratings. Gleason objected to this and, on February 16, 1970, CBS announced the cancellation of Gleason's series, during a time frame that also saw the cancellation of The Red Skelton Hour and Petticoat Junction, in the opening salvos of what would become popularly known as the rural purge. Beginning in late December 1970 CBS began airing selected reruns of The Jackie Gleason Show (featuring only the color Honeymooners episodes) in prime time on Sunday nights at 10 p.m. which replaced the Tim Conway Comedy Hour.

A low tack masking tape. Masking tape, also known as painter's tape, is a type of pressure-sensitive tape made of a thin and easy-to-tear paper, and an easily released pressure-sensitive adhesive. It is available in a variety of widths. It is used mainly in painting, to mask off areas that should not be painted. The adhesive is the key element to its usefulness, as it allows the tape to be easily removed without leaving residue or damaging the surface to which it is applied. The tape is available in several strengths, rated on a 1‚Äì100 scale based on the strength of the adhesive. Most painting operations will require a tape in the 50 range. Household masking tape is made of an even weaker paper and lower-grade adhesive. History Masking tape was invented in 1925 by 3M employee Richard Drew. Drew observed autobody workers growing frustrated when they removed butcher paper they had taped to cars they were painting. The strong adhesive on the tape peeled off some of the paint they had just applied. Touching up the damaged areas increased their costs. Drew realized the need for tape with a gentler adhesive. Usage For its original use of marking off areas where body paint is not desired, a special grade of painter's masking tape is needed. With this special grade, very clean lines can be produced. Without it, the paint bleeds under the edges of the tape, producing a fuzzy or varied line. Drafting tape looks similar to ordinary household masking tape, but has a lower tack. It is intended to hold blueprints to a drawing board or light table, and to pull off easily without damaging the drawing. House painter's tape is rated by how many days it can be left up without leaving residue on the surface being masked. It is available in 1-, 3-, 7-, 14-, 30-, and 60-day ratings, with the 7- and 14-day tapes being the most common. The longer-rated tapes are typically less adhesive, and are sold for use on smooth, delicate surfaces such as vinyl wallpaper and recently painted walls. Painter's (decorator's) tape in the U.S is most often the blue variety or sometimes purple in color as opposed to the tan or off white household masking tape. Spraying WD-40 is a popular way to remove any sticky residue.Masking tape residue Masking tape is also used in long strips on larger glass panes in situations where the glass might be shattered, harming those in the vicinity. Other types When constructed with plastic films instead of paper, masking tapes can be used for more rigorous applications. Polyester-based tapes are used to mask off during etching, plating, and in particular, powder coating. Tapes based on polyimide films can resist molten solder in electronics applications. Glass cloth tapes are often used in powder coating and sandblasting operations. Foil or vinyl tapes are often used in plating. Layered tapes made from multiple materials laminated together can be used for masking flame spray, thermal spray and HVOF. Masking tape can also be used to adhere posters to walls up to the day rating. Masking tape can basically be used for any purpose required of it, and is not limited solely to painting needs. The adhesive applied to a tape is often a critical determining factor for a given masking situation. There are three thin types of adhesives (with many chemical variations of each): rubber- based, acrylic-based, and silicone-based. Rubber-based adhesives generally provide the greatest adhesion, but the lowest temperature resistance. Acrylic- based adhesives offer a wide temperature range, providing adhesion from sub- freezing temperatures up to 275‚Äì325 ¬∞F (about 150 ¬∞C). Silicone-based adhesives provide the highest temperature resistance, with some tapes (such as some polyimide films and glass cloth tapes) allowing for intermittent use up to 500 ¬∞F (260 ¬∞C).

He combined his official role and his amateur interests to create a series of works about the history and geography of India, and in particular the area then known as Rajputana that corresponds to the present day state of Rajasthan, and which Tod referred to as Rajast'han. Tod was born in London and educated in Scotland. He joined the East India Company as a military officer and travelled to India in 1799 as a cadet in the Bengal Army. He rose quickly in rank, eventually becoming captain of an escort for an envoy in a Sindian royal court. After the Third Anglo-Maratha War, during which Tod was involved in the intelligence department, he was appointed Political Agent for some areas of Rajputana. His task was to help unify the region under the control of the East India Company. During this period Tod conducted most of the research that he would later publish. Tod was initially successful in his official role, but his methods were questioned by other members of the East India Company. Over time, his work was restricted and his areas of oversight were significantly curtailed. In 1823, owing to declining health and reputation, Tod resigned his post as Political Agent and returned to England. Back home in England, Tod published a number of academic works about Indian history and geography, most notably Annals and Antiquities of Rajast'han, based on materials collected during his travels. He retired from the military in 1826, and married Julia Clutterbuck that same year. He died in 1835, aged 53.

He was the second son for his parents, James and Mary (n√©e Heatly), both of whom came from families of \\"high standing\\", according to his major biographer, the historian Jason Freitag.Freitag (2001), p. 29. He was educated in Scotland, whence his ancestors came, although precisely where he was schooled is unknown.Freitag (2009), p. 35. Those ancestors included people who had fought with the King of Scots, Robert the Bruce; he took pride in this fact and had an acute sense of what he perceived to be the chivalric values of those times.Freitag (2007), p. 49. As with many people of Scots descent who sought adventure and success at that time, Tod joined the British East India Company and initially spent some time studying at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.Tod (1839), p. xviii. He left England for India in 1799 and in doing so followed in the footsteps of various other members of his family, including his father, although Tod senior had not been in the Company but had instead owned an indigo plantation at Mirzapur.Freitag (2001), p. 30. The young Tod journeyed as a cadet in the Bengal Army, appointment to which position was at the time reliant upon patronage.Freitag (2001), p. 31. He was appointed lieutenant in May 1800 and in 1805 was able to arrange his posting as a member of the escort to a family friend who had been appointed as Envoy and Resident to a Sindian royal court. By 1813 he had achieved promotion to the rank of captain and was commanding the escort.Freitag (2009), pp. 34‚Äì36. Painting of James Tod with his Jain guru, Yati Gyanchandra.

Original inscription: Kaptan Jems Tad Sahab (master), is riding from Udaipur to the Dabok Bungalow. Guru Gyanchandra rides also. Rather than being situated permanently in one place, the royal court was moved around the kingdom. Tod undertook various topographical and geological studies as it travelled from one area to another, using his training as an engineer and employing other people to do much of the field work. These studies culminated in 1815 with the production of a map which he presented to the Governor- General, the Marquis of Hastings. This map of \\"Central India\\" (his phrase) became of strategic importance to the British as they were soon to fight the Third Anglo-Maratha War. During that war, which ran from 1817 to 1818, Tod acted as a superintendent of the intelligence department and was able to draw on other aspects of regional knowledge which he had acquired while moving around with the court. He also drew up various strategies for the military campaign.Freitag (2009), p. 37. In 1818 he was appointed Political Agent for various states of western Rajputana, in the northwest of India, where the British East India Company had come to amicable arrangements with the Rajput rulers in order to exert indirect control over the area. The anonymous author of the introduction to Tod's posthumously published book, Travels in Western India, says that Tod continued his surveying work in this physically- challenging, arid and mountainous area.Gupta & Bakshi (2008), p. 132. His responsibilities were extended quickly: initially involving himself with the regions of Mewar, Kota, Sirohi and Bundi, he soon added Marwar to his portfolio and in 1821 was also given responsibility for Jaisalmer.Freitag (2009), pp. 37‚Äì40. These areas were considered a strategic buffer zone against Russian advances from the north which, it was feared, might result in a move into India via the Khyber Pass. Tod believed that to achieve cohesion it was necessary that the Rajput states should contain only Rajput people, with all others being expelled. This would assist in achieving stability in the areas, thus limiting the likelihood of the inhabitants being influenced by outside forces. According to Ramya Sreenivasan, a researcher of religion and caste in early modern Rajasthan and of colonialism, Tod's \\"transfers of territory between various chiefs and princes helped to create territorially consolidated states and 'routinised' political hierarchies.\\"Sreenivasan (2007), pp. 126‚Äì127.Peabody (1996), p. 203. His successes were plentiful and the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography notes that Tod was Tod was not, however, universally respected in the East India Company. His immediate superior, David Ochterlony, was unsettled by Tod's rapid rise and frequent failure to consult with him. One Rajput prince objected to Tod's close involvement in the affairs of his state and succeeded in persuading the authorities to remove Marwar from Tod's area of influence. In 1821 his favouritism towards one party in a princely dispute, contrary to the orders given to him, gave rise to a severe reprimand and a formal restriction of his ability to operate without consulting Ochterlony, as well as the removal of Kota from his charge. Jaisalmer was then taken out of his sphere of influence in 1822, as official concerns grew regarding his sympathy for the Rajput princes. This and other losses of status, such as the reduction in the size of his escort, caused him to believe that his personal reputation and ability to work successfully in Mewar, by now the one area still left to him, was too diminished to be acceptable. He resigned his role as Political Agent in Mewar later that year, citing ill health. Reginald Heber, the Bishop of Calcutta, commented that In February 1823, Tod left India for England, having first travelled to Bombay by a circuitous route for his own pleasure.Freitag (2009), p. 40. During the last years of his life Tod talked about India at functions in Paris and elsewhere across Europe. He also became a member of the newly established Royal Asiatic Society in London, for whom he acted for some time as librarian. He suffered an apoplectic fit in 1825 as a consequence of overwork,Tod (1839), p. xlvii. and retired from his military career in the following year, soon after he had been promoted to lieutenant-colonel. His marriage to Julia Clutterbuck (daughter of Henry Clutterbuck) in 1826 produced three children ‚Äì Grant Heatly Tod-Heatly, Edward H. M. Tod and Mary Augusta Tod ‚Äì but his health, which had been poor for much of his life,Freitag (2009), p. 41. was declining. Having lived at Birdhurst, Croydon, from October 1828, Tod and his family moved to London three years later. He spent much of the last year of his life abroad in an attempt to cure a chest complaint and died on 18 November 1835 soon after his return to England from Italy. The cause of death was an apoplectic fit sustained on the day of his wedding anniversary, although he survived for a further 27 hours. He had moved into a house in Regent's Park earlier in that year. Worldview Historian Lynn Zastoupil has noted that Tod's personal papers have never been found and \\"his voluminous publications and official writings contain only scattered clues regarding the nature of his personal relationships with Rajputs\\".Zastoupil (2002). This has not discouraged assessments being made of both him and his worldview. According to Theodore Koditschek, whose fields of study include historiography and British imperial history, Tod saw the Rajputs as \\"natural allies of the British in their struggles against the Mughal and Maratha states\\".Koditschek (2011), p. 68. Norbert Peabody, an anthropologist and historian, has gone further, arguing that \\"maintaining the active support of groups, like the Rajputs for example, was not only important in meeting the threat of indigenous rivals but also in countering the imperial aspirations of other European powers.\\"Peabody (1996), p. 204. He stated that some of Tod's thoughts were \\"implicated in [British] colonial policy toward western India for over a century.\\"Peabody (1996), p. 185. The Residency building in Udaipur, which was the home of the Political Agent. The title of \\"Political Agent\\" for the region was changed to \\"Resident\\" in 1881.British Library, Residency. Tod favoured the then-fashionable concept of Romantic nationalism. Influenced by this, he thought that each princely state should be inhabited by only one community and his policies were designed to expel Marathas, Pindaris and other groups from Rajput territories. It also influenced his instigation of treaties that were intended to redraw the territorial boundaries of the various states. The geographical and political boundaries before his time had in some cases been blurred, primarily due to local arrangements based on common kinship, and he wanted a more evident delineation of the entities, He was successful in both of these endeavours. Tod was unsuccessful in implementing another of his ideas, which was also based on the ideology of Romantic nationalism. He believed that the replacement of Maratha rule with that of the British had resulted in the Rajputs merely swapping the onerous overlordship of one government for that of another. Although he was one of the architects of indirect rule, in which the princes looked after domestic affairs but paid tribute to the British for protection in foreign affairs, he was also a critic of it. He saw the system as one that prevented achievement of true nationhood, and therefore, as Peabody describes, \\"utterly subversive to the stated goal of preserving them as viable entities.\\"Peabody (1996), pp. 206‚Äì207. Tod wrote in 1829 that the system of indirect rule had a tendency to \\"national degradation\\" of the Rajput territories and that this undermined them because There was a political aspect to his views: if the British recast themselves as overseers seeking to re- establish lost Rajput nations, then this would at once smooth the relationship between those two parties and distinguish the threatening, denationalising Marathas from the paternal, nation-creating British. It was an argument that had been deployed by others in the European arena, including in relation to the way in which Britain portrayed the imperialism of Napoleonic France as denationalising those countries which it conquered, whereas (it was claimed) British imperialism freed people; William Bentinck, a soldier and statesmen who later in life served as Governor-General of India, noted in 1811 that \\"Bonaparte made kings; England makes nations\\".Peabody (1996), p. 209. However, his arguments in favour of granting sovereignty to the Rajputs failed to achieve that end, although the frontispiece to volume one of his Annals did contain a plea to the then English King George IV to reinstate the \\"former independence\\" of the Rajputs.Peabody (1996), p. 217. While he viewed the Muslim Mughals as despotic and the Marathas as predatory,Peabody (1996), p. 212. Tod saw the Rajput social systems as being similar to the feudal system of medieval Europe, and their traditions of recounting history through the generations as similar to the clan poets of the Scottish Highlanders. There was, he felt, a system of checks and balances between the ruling princes and their vassal lords, a tendency for feuds and other rivalries, and often a serf-like peasantry.Metcalf (1997), pp. 73‚Äì74. The Rajputs were, in his opinion, on the same developmental trajectory that nations such as Britain had followed. His ingenious use of these viewpoints later enabled him to promote in his books the notion that there was a shared experience between the people of Britain and this community in a distant, relatively unexplored area of the empire. He speculated that there was a common ancestor shared by the Rajputs and Europeans somewhere deep in prehistory and that this might be proven by comparison of the commonality in their history of ideas, such as myth and legend. In this he shared a contemporary aspiration to prove that all communities across the world had a common origin.Sreenivasan (2007), pp. 130‚Äì132.Koditschek (2011), p. 69.Tod (1829), Vol. 1., pp. 72‚Äì74. There was another appeal inherent in a feudal system, and it was not unique to Tod: the historian Thomas R. Metcalf has said that Above all, the chivalric ideal viewed character as more worthy of admiration than wealth or intellect, and this appealed to the old landed classes at home as well as to many who worked for the Indian Civil Service. In the 1880s, Alfred Comyn Lyall, an administrator of the British Raj who also studied history, revisited Tod's classification and asserted that the Rajput society was in fact tribal, based on kinship rather than feudal vassalage. He had previously generally agreed with Tod, who acknowledged claims that blood-ties played some sort of role in the relationship between princes and vassals in many states. In shifting the emphasis from a feudal to a tribal basis, Lyall was able to deny the possibility that the Rajput kingdoms might gain sovereignty. If Rajput society was not feudal, then it was not on the same trajectory that European nations had followed, thereby forestalling any need to consider that they might evolve into sovereign states. There was thus no need for Britain to consider itself to be illegitimately governing them.Peabody (1996), p. 215. Tod's enthusiasm for bardic poetry reflected the works of Sir Walter Scott on Scottish subjects, which had a considerable influence both on British literary society and, bearing in mind Tod's Scottish ancestry, on Tod himself. Tod reconstructed Rajput history on the basis of the ancient texts and folklore of the Rajputs, although not everyone ‚Äì for example, the polymath James Mill ‚Äì accepted the historical validity of the native works. Tod also used philological techniques to reconstruct areas of Rajput history that were not even known to the Rajputs themselves, by drawing on works such as the religious texts known as Puranas. Publications Jug Mandir Palace, Lake Pichola, Udaipur. Plate 8 of Tod's Annals (1829) The bridge at Noorabad. Plate 24 from Tod's Annals (1829) Koditschek says that Tod \\"developed an interest in triangulating local culture, politics and history alongside his maps\\", and Metcalf believes that Tod \\"ordered [the Rajputs'] past as well as their present\\" while working in India.Metcalf (1997), p. 73. During his time in Rajputana, Tod was able to collect materials for his Annals and Antiquities of Rajast'han, which detailed the contemporary geography and history of Rajputana and Central India along with the history of the Rajput clans who ruled most of the area at that time. Described by historian Crispin Bates as \\"a romantic historical and anecdotal account\\"Bates (1995), p. 242. and by David Arnold, another historian, as a \\"travel narrative\\" by \\"one of India's most influential Romantic writers\\",Arnold (2004), p. 343. the work was published in two volumes, in 1829 and 1832, and included illustrations and engravings by notable artists such as the Storers, Louis Haghe and either Edward or William Finden.The Literary Gazette and Journal (1829), Sights of books, p. 536. He had to finance publication himself: sales of works on history had been moribund for some time and his name was not particularly familiar either at home or abroad.Tod (1839), pp. li‚Äìlii. Original copies are now scarce, but they have been reprinted in many editions. The version published in 1920, which was edited by the orientalist and folklorist William Crooke, is significantly editorialised.Peabody (1996), p. 187. Freitag has argued that the Annals \\"is first and foremost a story of the heroes of Rajasthan ... plotted in a certain way ‚Äì there are villains, glorious acts of bravery, and a chivalric code to uphold\\".Freitag (2001), p. 20. So dominant did Tod's work become in the popular and academic mind that they largely replaced the older accounts upon which Tod based much of his content, notably the Prithvir√£j R√£jo and the Nainsi ri Khy√£t.Freitag (2009), p. 10. Kumar Singh, of the Anthropological Survey of India, has explained that the Annals were primarily based on \\"bardic accounts and personal encounters\\" and that they \\"glorified and romanticised the Rajput rulers and their country\\" but ignored other communities.Singh (1998), p. xvi. One aspect of history that Tod studied in his Annals was the genealogy of the Chathis Rajkula (36 royal races), for the purpose of which he took advice on linguistic issues from a panel of pandits, including a Jain guru called Yati Gyanchandra.Freitag (2009), pp. 112, 120, 164. He said that he was \\"desirous of epitomising the chronicles of the martial races of Central and Western India\\" and that this necessitated study of their genealogy. The sources for this were Puranas held by the Rana of Udaipur.Tod (1829), Vol. 1., p. 17. Tod also submitted arch√¶ological papers to the Royal Asiatic Society's Transactions series. He was interested in numismatics as well, and he discovered the first specimens of Bactrian and Indo-Greek coins from the Hellenistic period following the conquests of Alexander the Great, which were described in his books. These ancient kingdoms had been largely forgotten or considered semi-legendary, but Tod's findings confirmed the long-term Greek presence in Afghanistan and Punjab. Similar coins have been found in large quantities since his death.The Gentleman's Magazine (February 1836), Obituary, pp. 203‚Äì204.Wilson (1998), pp. 4‚Äì10. In addition to these writings, he produced a paper on the politics of Western India that was appended to the report of the House of Commons committee on Indian affairs, 1833. He had also taken notes on his journey to Bombay and collated them for another book, Travels in Western India. That book was published posthumously in 1839. Reception Palace and fortress at Bundi. Plate 1 of Tod's Annals (1832) Bust of Tod made after he returned to England Criticism of the Annals came soon after publication. The anonymous author of the introduction to his posthumously published Travels states that Further criticism followed. Tod was an officer of the British imperial system, at that time the world's dominant power. Working in India, he attracted the attention of local rulers who were keen to tell their own tales of defiance against the Mughal empire. He heard what they told him but knew little of what they omitted. He was a soldier writing about a caste renowned for its martial abilities, and he was aided in his writings by the very people whom he was documenting. He had been interested in Rajput history prior to coming into contact with them in an official capacity, as administrator of the region in which they lived. These factors, says Freitag, contribute to why the Annals were \\"manifestly biased\\".Freitag (2009), pp. 3‚Äì5. Freitag argues that critics of Tod's literary output can be split into two groups: those who concentrate on his errors of fact and those who concentrate on his failures of interpretation. Tod relied heavily on existing Indian texts for his historical information and most of these are today considered unreliable. Crooke's introduction to Tod's 1920 edition of the Annals recorded that the old Indian texts recorded \\"the facts, not as they really occurred, but as the writer and his contemporaries supposed that they occurred.\\"Crooke (Annals, 1920 ed.), introduction to Vol. 1., p. xxx. Crooke also says that Tod's \\"knowledge of ethnology was imperfect, and he was unable to reject the local chronicles of the Rajputs.\\"Crooke (Annals, 1920 ed.), introduction to Vol. 1., p. xxxi. More recently, Robin Donkin, a historian and geographer, has argued that, with one exception, \\"there are no native literary works with a developed sense of chronology, or indeed much sense of place, before the thirteenth century\\", and that researchers must rely on the accounts of travellers from outside the country.Donkin (1998), p. 152. Tod's work relating to the genealogy of the Chathis Rajkula was criticised as early as 1872, when an anonymous reviewer in the Calcutta Review said that Other examples of dubious interpretations made by Tod include his assertions regarding the ancestry of the Mohil Rajput clan when, even today, there is insufficient evidence to prove his point.Handa (1981), p. RA-120. He also mistook Rana Kumbha, a ruler of Mewar in the fifteenth century, as being the husband of the princess-saint Mira BaiNilsson (1997), pp. 12, 19. and misrepresented the story of the queen Padmini.Sreenivasan (2007), p. 140. The founder of the Archaeological Survey of India, Alexander Cunningham, writing in 1885, noted that Tod had made \\"a whole bundle of mistakes\\" in relation to the dating of the Battle of Khanwa,Cunningham (1885), p. 97. and Crooke notes in his introduction to the 1920 edition that Tod's \\"excursions into philology are the diversions of a clever man, not of a trained scholar, but interested in the subject as an amateur.\\"Crooke (Annals, 1920 ed.), introduction to Vol. 1., p. xxxix. Michael Meister, an architectural historian and professor of South Asia Studies, has commented that Tod had a \\"general reputation for inaccuracy ... among Indologists by late in the nineteenth century\\", although the opinion of those Indologists sometimes prevented them from appreciating some of the useful aspects in his work.Meister (1981), p. 57. That reputation persists, with one modern writer, V. S. Srivastava of Rajasthan's Department of Archaeology and Museums, commenting that his works \\"are erroneous and misleading at places and they are to be used with caution as a part of sober history\\".Srivastava (1981), p. 120. In its time, Tod's work was influential even among officials of the government, although it was never formally recognised as authoritative. Andrea Major, who is a cultural and colonial historian, has commented on a specific example, that of the tradition of sati (ritual immolation of a widow): The romantic nationalism that Tod espoused was used by Indian nationalist writers, especially those from the 1850s, as they sought to resist British control of the country. Works such as Jyotirindranath Tagore's Sarojini ba Chittor Akrama and Girishchandra Ghosh's Ananda Raho retold Tod's vision of the Rajputs in a manner to further their cause. Other works which drew their story from Tod's works include Padmini Upakhyan (1858) by Rangalal Banerjee and Krishna Kumari (1861) by Michael Madhusudan Dutt.Mehrotra (2006), pp. 7-8 In modern-day India, he is still revered by those whose ancestors he documented in good light. In 1997, the Maharana Mewar Charitable Foundation instituted an award named after Tod and intended it to be given to modern non- Indian writers who exemplified Tod's understanding of the area and its people.Freitag (2009), pp. 2, 4. In other recognition of his work in Mewar Province, a village has been named Todgarh,Sebastian (2010). and it has been claimed that Tod was in fact a Rajput as an outcome of the process of karma and rebirth.Freitag (2009), n. 2 p. 2. Freitag describes the opinion of the Rajput people Furthermore, Freitag points out that \\"the information age has also anointed Tod as the spokesman for Rajasthan, and the glories of India in general, as attested by the prominent quotations from him that appear in tourism related websites.\\"Freitag (2009), pp. 8‚Äì9.

The lower (early) Cretaceous rocks are sandstones and mudstones whilst those of the upper (late) Cretaceous are the various formations which comprise the Chalk Group and give rise to the county's downlands. Overlying these rocks are the less consolidated Palaeogene clays, sands, gravels and silts of the Lambeth, Thames and Bracklesham Groups which characterise the Hampshire Basin. Hampshire Basin In the south, along the coast, soft Eocene and Oligocene clays and gravels form low flat terrain, the Hampshire Basin. Protected from sea erosion by the Isle of Purbeck, Dorset, and the Isle of Wight, this land supports heathland and woodland habitats, a large area of which form part of the New Forest. Much of the coastal landscape of the Hampshire Basin results from sea level rise in the Flandrian (after the last ice age) some 6000 years BP. There are several large estuaries and rias, notably the 12 mile long Southampton Water and the large convoluted Portsmouth Harbour. The Solent, which separates the Isle of Wight from the coast of Hampshire, is itself a flooded river valley, further erosion having broken the remaining chalk link with the mainland. Chalk Downs In the centre and north of the county the substrate is the chalk of the Hampshire Downs and the South Downs. These are high hills with steep slopes where they border the clays to the south. The downland supports a calcareous grassland habitat, important for wild flowers and insects, as well as arable agriculture. The hills dip steeply forming a scarp onto the Kennet valley to the north, and dip gently to the south. The highest point in the county is Pilot Hill, which reaches the height of 286m/938ft. The rivers Test and Itchen flow from the downland through green valleys, both supporting trout and other wildlife. A series of east-west trending folds in the chalk to the north of the Hampshire Basin is controlled by faults in the underlying Jurassic strata. From south to north these are the Winchester-East Meon Anticline, the Winchester-King's Somborne Syncline/Alderbury - Mottisfont Syncline, the Stockbridge Anticline and the Micheldever Syncline. The Winchester-East Meon Anticline in particular gives rise to many hills including Yew Hill, Compton Down, Oliver's Battery, Magdalen (Morn) Hill, Chilcomb Down, Cheesefoot Head, Telegraph Hill, Deacon Hill, Twyford Down, St. Catherine's Hill, Beacon Hill, Old Winchester Hill and Henwood Down. Around the chalk margins to the north are the Pewsey-Kingsclere Anticline and to the south the Dean Hill Anticline, Portsdown Anticline, Forest of Bere Syncline and Chichester Syncline. Further north, beyond the downs, the landscape is again lowland clay and gravel heathland, though the north is generally greener and more diverse than the south.

Smith (born ) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. She was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 2003 to 2011 who represented the riding of Nipissing. She was a cabinet minister in the government of Dalton McGuinty. Background Smith was born and raised in North Bay, Ontario, the largest city in the Nipissing riding. She has a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto, and a law degree from Queen's University. After graduating, she worked at the Toronto law firm of McCarthy T√©trault until 1997, when she resigned to work as chief of staff for provincial Liberal leader Dalton McGuinty. She served as director of operations for the Liberals in the 1999 provincial election, which the party lost. After this election, Smith became executive director of the Association of Canadian Publishers, and represented the organization across the country. She returned to North Bay in 2002, and worked for the firm of Larmer and Larmer. Her father, Dick Smith, represented Nipissing in the legislature from 1965 to 1977. Her mother Marthe Smith was the Liberal candidate for the riding in 1987. Politics Smith ran for political office in the 2003 provincial election, in the Nipissing riding (until recently held by former Progressive Conservative Premier Mike Harris). Despite her roots in the North Bay community, she was often described as a \\"Toronto lawyer\\" and a \\"parachute candidate\\" by the Tory campaign. These criticisms were not an obstacle to her being elected, and she defeated Harris' immediate successor, Al McDonald, by just over 3,000 votes. The Liberals won the election, and Smith was subsequently named parliamentary assistant to George Smitherman, the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care. In December 2003, Smitherman commissioned her to undertake a comprehensive review of the province's long-term care system. The review was published in May 2004 calling for more funding and inspections. On October 30, 2007 following the provincial election, Premier Dalton McGuinty appointed Smith into cabinet as the province's Minister of Revenue. In a cabinet shuffle on September 18, 2008, Smith was appointed as the province's Minister of Tourism. On February 4, 2009 Smith was appointed Government House Leader. She continued as Minister of Tourism until she was appointed Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs in January 2010. On November 19, 2010, Smith announced that she would not run in the 2011 election. In August 2013, Premier Kathleen Wynne appointed Smith to represent the Government of Ontario at its office at the Canadian Embassy in Washington, DC.

Designed by a partnership under military auspices of Sparkman & Stephens and General Motors Corporation (GMC), the DUKW was used for the transportation of goods and troops over land and water. Excelling at approaching and crossing beaches in amphibious warfare attacks, it was intended only to last long enough to meet the demands of combat. Surviving DUKWs have since found popularity as tourist craft in marine environments. Etymology The name DUKW comes from General Motors Corporation model nomenclature: * D, Designed in 1942 * U, Utility * K, All-wheel drive * W, Dual-tandem rear axles Decades later, the designation was explained erroneously by writers such as Donald Clarke, who wrote in 1978 that it was an initialism for \\"Duplex Universal Karrier, Wheeled\\". History The DUKW was designed by Rod Stephens, Jr. of Sparkman & Stephens, Inc. yacht designers, Dennis Puleston, a British deep-water sailor resident in the U.S., and Frank W. Speir from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Developed by the National Defense Research Committee and the Office of Scientific Research and Development to solve the problem of resupply to units which had just performed an amphibious landing, it was initially rejected by the armed services. When a United States Coast Guard patrol craft ran aground on a sand bar near Provincetown, Massachusetts, an experimental DUKW happened to be in the area for a demonstration. Winds up to , rain, and heavy surf prevented conventional craft from rescuing the seven stranded Coast Guardsmen, but the DUKW had no trouble, and military opposition to the DUKW melted. The DUKW later proved its seaworthiness by crossing the English Channel. The final production design was perfected by a few engineers at Yellow Truck & Coach in Pontiac, Michigan. The vehicle was built by Yellow Truck and Coach Co. (GMC Truck and Coach Div. after 1943) at their Pontiac West Assembly Plant and Chevrolet Div. of General Motors Corp. at their St. Louis Truck Assembly Plant; 21,147 were manufactured before production ended in 1945. Description DUKW at the Eden Camp museum, England The DUKW was built around the GMC AFKWX, a cab-over-engine (COE) version of the GMC CCKW six-wheel-drive military truck, with the addition of a watertight hull and a propeller. It was powered by a GMC Model 270 straight- six engine. A five-speed overdrive transmission drove a transfer case for the propeller, then a two-speed transfer case to drive the axles. The propeller and front axle were selectable from their transfer case. A power take-off on the transmission drove an air-compressor and winch. It weighed empty and operated at on road and on water. It was long, wide, high with the folding- canvas top down and high with the top up.Rear view of a DUKW preserved at the Fort Lewis Military Museum, Washington. The propeller tunnel, propeller, and rudder can be seen (2009) It was not an armored vehicle, being plated with sheet steel between thick to minimize weight. A high-capacity bilge pump system kept it afloat if the thin hull was breached by holes up to in diameter. One in four DUKWs mounted a Browning heavy machine gun on a ring mount.Fitzsimons, Bernard, general editor. The Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare (London: Phoebus, 1978), Vol. 8, p.802, \\"DUKW\\". The DUKW was the first vehicle to allow the driver to vary the tire pressure from inside the cab. The tires could be fully inflated for hard surfaces such as roads and less inflated for softer surfaces, especially beach sand. This added to its versatility as an amphibious vehicle. This feature is now standard on many military vehicles. Service history = World War II = A British DUKW carries American airborne troops and supplies across the River Waal at Nijmegen, 30 September 1944 The DUKW was supplied to the U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps and Allied forces, and 2,000 were supplied to Britain under the Lend-Lease program; 535 were acquired by Australian forces, and 586 were supplied to the Soviet Union, which built its own version, the BAV 485, after the war. DUKWs were initially sent to Guadalcanal in the Pacific Theater, but were used by an invasion force for the first time in the European theater, during the Sicilian invasion, Operation Husky, in the Mediterranean. They were used on the D-Day beaches of Normandy and in the Battle of the Scheldt, Operation Veritable, and Operation Plunder. In the Pacific, USMC DUKW's were used to cross the coral reefs of islands such as Saipan and Guam and the tires were not affected by the coral.p. 26 The Marines in the Pacific War The Marine Corps Gazette, Volume 31 Marine Corps Association, 1947 Some DUKWs used in WW2 were reported to have capsized while landing at Omaha beach during the Normandy invasion. =After the war= After World War II, reduced numbers were kept in service by the United States, Britain, France, and Australia, with many stored pending disposal. Australia transferred many to Citizens Military Force units. The U.S. Army reactivated and deployed several hundred at the outbreak of the Korean War with the 1st Transportation Replacement Training Group providing crew training. DUKWs were used extensively to bring supplies ashore during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter and in the amphibious landings at Incheon. Ex-U.S. Army DUKWs were transferred to the French military after World War II and were used by the Troupes de marine and naval commandos. Many were used for general utility duties in overseas territories. France deployed DUKWs to French Indochina during the First Indochina War. Some French DUKWs were given new hulls in the 1970s, with the last being retired in 1982. Britain deployed DUKWs to Malaya during the Malayan Emergency of 1948‚Äì60. Many were redeployed to Borneo during the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation of 1962‚Äì66. =Later military use= The Royal Marines used five of these vehicles for training at 11 (Amphibious Trials and Training) Squadron, 1 Assault Group Royal Marines at Instow, North Devon. Four were manufactured between 1943 and 1945. The fifth is a DUKW hull copy manufactured in 1993 with unused World War II-vintage running gear parts. In 1999, a refurbishment programme began to extend their service life to 2014. DUKWs were removed from service in 2012. The DUKWs were used for safety, allowing all ranks to undertake training drills for boat work for the landing craft ranks, and drivers undertaking wading drills from the Landing Craft Utility. =Principal military users= * United States * Australia ‚Äì 535 * Brazil * Canada ‚Äì about 800 * Dominican Republic * France * Philippines * Iraq * Soviet Union ‚Äì 586 * United Kingdom ‚Äì about 2,000 Developments Superduck prototype In the latter 1940s and throughout the 1950s, while Speir, now project engineer for the Army's Amphibious Warfare Program, worked on \\"bigger and better\\" amphibious vehicles such as the \\"Super Duck\\", the \\"Drake\\", and the mammoth BARC (Barge, Amphibious, Resupply, Cargo), many DUKWs were made surplus and used as rescue vehicles by fire departments and Coast Guard stations. In 1952, the Soviet Union produced a derivative, the BAV 485, adding a rear loading ramp. The Zavod imeni Stalina factory built it on the structure of its ZiS-151 truck, and production continued until 1962, with over 2,000 units delivered. Civilian use The \\"Moby Duck\\" at a parade in Seattle (2006) Many were used after WWII by civilian organizations such as the police, fire departments, and rescue units. The Australian Army lent two DUKWs and crew to Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions for a 1948 expedition to Macquarie Island. Australian DUKWs were used on Antarctic supply voyages until 1970. From 1945 to 1965, the Australian Commonwealth Lighthouse Service supply ship Cape York carried ex-Army DUKWs for supplying lighthouses on remote islands. One DUKW is in use by the Technisches Hilfswerk (THW) of Germersheim in Germany, a civil protection organisation. Tourist attractions DUKWs are still in use as tourist transport in harbor and river cities across the globe, and have been associated with a number of fatal accidents. The first \\"duck tour\\" company was started in 1946 by Mel Flath in Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin. The company is still in operation under the name Original Wisconsin Ducks.

Prehistoric Kent Swanscombe Skull Kent has been occupied since the Lower Palaeolithic as finds from the quarries at Swanscombe attest. The Swanscombe skull, uncovered at Barnfield Pit, a quarry in Swanscombe, is the oldest skull found in Britain. Identified as Homo heidelbergensis it dates to the Hoxnian Interglacial 400,000 years ago. During the Neolithic the Medway megaliths were built and there is a rich sequence of Bronze Age occupation indicated by finds and features such as the Ringlemere gold cup. Iron Age Kent The name Kent probably means 'rim' or 'border' (compare the dictionary words cant in English, Kant in German, etc.), regarding the eastern part of the modern county as a 'border land' or 'coastal district.' Historical linguists believe that the proto-Indo-European root *kanthos could not pass into a Germanic language with its initial K sound intact, so the word must have passed via an intermediate language, either Celtic or Latin. Julius Caesar described it as Cantium, although he did not record the inhabitants' name for themselves, in 51 BC. His writings suggest localised groups of people whose chieftains were flattered by his description of them as 'kings'. Writing of the Britons generally in his Commentarii de Bello Gallico Caesar noted that: \\"...by far the most civilised are those who inhabit Cantium, the whole of which is a maritime region; and their manners differ little from those of the Gauls\\". Pottery studies indicate the county east of the River Medway was inhabited by Belgic peoples who were part of an economic and cultural region embracing south east England and the lands across the English Channel. The extreme west of the modern county was occupied by other Iron Age tribes; the Regnenses and possibly another ethnic group occupying The Weald known today as the Wealden People. During the late pre-Roman Iron Age the names of a few British kings are known, such as Dumnovellaunus and Adminius. An Iron Age settlement seems to have formed the basis for the later town of Folkestone, whilst a hillfort of that date seems to be the forerunner of Dover Castle. Roman Kent Ruins Richborough Fort Although now two miles from the sea amid the marshes of east Kent, Richborough Castle was arguably the Romans' main entry point when they invaded Britain in circa AD 43. They established a bridgehead and commemorated their success by building a triumphal arch whose cross shaped foundations still survive at the site which is now looked after by English Heritage. Roman Britain was under attack by Saxon and other raiders in the 3rd century and it became necessary to fortify the once-prosperous commercial port of Rutupiae. Triple ditches and ramparts were dug (still visible round the site of the arch Richborough Castle although the defences were completely revamped after a decade or so and Richborough was provided with its circuit of towered stone walls and outer ditches, becoming one of the most important of the Saxon shore forts. It was one of the last to be regularly occupied and there is evidence of a large Roman population here in the early 5th century, some of them worshipping in the Early Christian church discovered in a corner of the fort. Early Medieval Kent Kent in the 4th century shown on the Peutinger Map. Following the withdrawal of the Romans, a large-scale immigration of Germanic peoples occurred in Kent.Stuart Brookes and Susan Harrington, The Kingdom and People of Kent, AD 400-600 (2010), p. 24 These groups introduced the Old English language to Britain. It is likely that some of the native Romano- Britons remained in the area, however, as they were able to influence its name (recorded as Cantia or Cent) even after the settlement of the Germanic tribes.Stuart Brookes and Susan Harrington, The Kingdom and People of Kent, AD 400-600 (2010), p. 35 East Kent became one of the kingdoms of the Jutes during the 5th century (see Kingdom of Kent). The early Medieval inhabitants of the county were known as the Cantwara or Kentish people, whose capital (the only town called a metropolis by BedeHindley, Geoffrey. A Brief History of The Anglo-Saxons. 2007.) was at Canterbury. Canterbury is the religious centre of the Anglican faith, and see of Saint Augustine of Canterbury. Augustine is traditionally credited with bringing Christianity to Anglo Saxon England, landing at Ebbsfleet, Pegwell Bay on the Isle of Thanet (northeast of Kent) in the spring of 597. A lathe was an ancient administration division of Kent, and may well have originated during the Jutish colonisation of the county. These ancient divisions still exist, but have no administrative significance today. There were seven Lathes in Kent at the time of the Domesday Book, which reveals that in 1086 Kent was divided into the seven lathes or \\"lest(um)\\": Aylesford, Milton, Sutton, Borough, Eastry, Lympne and Wye. For administrative, judicial and taxation purposes these units remained important for another 600 years, although by 1295 the number of lathes had reduced to five: Borough and Eastry were merged to form the Lathe of St. Augustine, the lathe of Lympne was renamed the Lathe of Shepway, the lathes of Milton and Wye were merged to form the Lathe of Scray.J. E. A. Jolliffe, \\"The Hidation of Kent\\", in English Historical Review, Vol. 44, No. 176 (October 1929), pp. 612-618 1611 map of the Lathes of Kent accessed 6 March 2008 Each of the lathes were divided into smaller areas called hundreds, although the difference between the functions of lathes and hundreds remains unclear.Jessup, Frank W. History of Kent. 1958 Medieval Kent Following the invasion of Britain by William of Normandy the people of Kent adopted the motto Invicta meaning \\"unconquered\\" and claimed that they had frightened the Normans away. This claim was given credence by the fact that the Normans had quickly marched to London without subduing the Kentish lords and peasantry, constantly harassed and ambushed by the Kentish populace at every turn. Kent did not submit to Norman rule until their rights and privileges had been acknowledged and unmolested. As a result, Kent became a semi-autonomous County Palatine under William's half-brother Odo of Bayeux, with the special powers otherwise reserved for counties bordering Wales and Scotland. A decade after the Norman conquest, Penenden Heath near Maidstone was the scene of a successful trial of Odo of Bayeux. The trial, ordered by William I at the behest of Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury challenged the Earl's purported landholdings in the county, an event which represented an important attempt by Saxon landowners to reassert their pre-Norman rights and privileges. Gavelkind was one of the most interesting examples of customary law in England. After the Norman Conquest, gavelkind was superseded by the feudal law of primogeniture in the rest of England, but in Kent gavelkind meant that on death, a man's property was equally divided amongst his surviving sons, which led to land being divided into ever smaller parcels. Therefore, the strip system of farming in open fields was never established in Kent. This gives evidence to the Invicta legend and seems to support that, at least among smaller land owners and common folk, Normans were forced to respect Kentish rights and law. Gavelkind was finally abolished by the Law of Property Act in 1925. During the medieval period, Kent produced several rebellions including the Peasants' Revolt led by Wat Tyler and later, Jack Cade's rebellion of 1450. Thomas Wyatt led an army into London from Kent in 1553, against Mary I. Canterbury became a great pilgrimage site following the martyrdom of Thomas Becket, who was eventually canonised in 1246. Canterbury's religious role also gave rise to Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, a key development in the rise of the written English language and ostensibly set in the countryside of Kent. Rochester had its own martyr, William of Perth, and in 1256 Lawrence, Bishop of Rochester travelled to Rome to obtain William's canonisation. As well as numerous fortified manor houses, Kent has a number of traditional militarily significant castles, including those at Allington, Chilham, Dover, Hever, Leeds, Rochester and Walmer, built to protect the coast, the River Medway or routes into London. Kent also played a significant role in the English Civil War around 1648. Early Modern Kent The Royal Navy first used the River Medway in 1547 when a storehouse was rented on 'Jyllingham Water'. By the reign of Elizabeth I (1558‚Äì1603) a small dockyard had been established at Chatham. By 1618, storehouses, a ropewalk, a drydock and houses for officials had been built downstream from Chatham. By the 17th century, tensions between Britain and the continental powers of the Netherlands and France led to increasing military build-up in the county. Forts were built along the coast following a raid by the Dutch navy on the shipyards of the Medway towns in 1667. The 18th century was dominated with wars with France, and the Medway became the prime position to base a fleet that would act against the Dutch and French Coasts. When the theatre of operation moved to the Atlantic, Portsmouth and Plymouth assumed these roles and Chatham concentrated on shipbuilding and ship repair. Many of the Georgian naval buildings are still extant. In peacetime the work force at Chatham Dockyard was reduced to a quarter of its wartime roll. Chatham Dockyard built over 400 naval ships including in the age of ships of the line, ironclads including 1905, and 57 submarines, while also refitting ships. The keel for HMS Victory was laid at Chatham on 23 July 1759. During World War II, Chatham refitted 1360 warships such as HMS Ajax. Charles Dickens' father worked in the dockyard, and Chatham, Rochester and the Cliffe marshes were to feature in many of his books. As an indication of the area's military importance, the first Ordnance Survey map ever drawn was the 1 inch map of Kent, published in 1801. Work on the map started in 1795. In the early 19th century smugglers were very active on the Kent coastline, with gangs, such as the Aldington Gang bringing spirits, tobacco and salt to Kent, taking goods like wool across the English Channel to France. On Saturday night, 28 August 1830, a widespread uprising by rural workers began in East Kent, with the destruction of threshing machines in the Elham Valley area and by the third week of October, over one hundred machines had been destroyed. The uprising, that eventually became known as the Swing Riots, spread across southern England and East Anglia. The general unrest, particularly about the state of the workhouses, was instrumental in the introduction of the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834.  Recent discoveries  In May, 2019 Kent Archaeological Field School uncovered 150 ft-long by 50 ft wide Roman building at Abbey Farm. According to the Dr Paul Wilkinson, the building contained broken stone walls covering huge amounts of box flue tiles, which were used to direct hot air up the indoor walls, glazed terracotta floors, an untouched underfloor with hypocaust heating and tons of ceramic roof tiles. Although the plaster painted from these walls were mostly white, plaster walls colored with green, red and yellow panels were found in the hot sauna room on the north side of the building. Kent and London As London developed over time, especially during the 19th century, it expanded into north-west Kent. Settlements in this area became urbanised and increasingly regarded as suburbs of London. This view became stronger as local government areas in the region were created that were more closely aligned with London than with Kent. An administrative area known as the County of London was created by the Local Government Act 1888. The new county incorporated part of north west Kent including Deptford, Greenwich, Woolwich and Lewisham. Penge was gained from Surrey by the London Government Act 1899. The London Government Act 1963 created an enlarged Greater London in 1965 which took in more of northwest Kent. The Local Government Act 1972 abolished the previous structure of local government in 1974 and created a new non-metropolitan county of Kent, divided into districts. It also abolished Canterbury as a county borough which became a district under the new county council. The places that had been removed in 1888 were amalgamated to form the London Borough of Lewisham and the Royal Borough of Greenwich and two further boroughs were created. These were the London Borough of Bromley, an amalgamation of Bromley, Beckenham, Chislehurst, Orpington and Penge and the London Borough of Bexley comprising Bexley, Sidcup, Erith and Crayford. Modern Kent Much of the Battle of Britain during World War II was fought in the skies over the county, and between June 1944 and March 1945, over 10,000 V1 flying bombs, or Doodlebugs were fired on London from bases in Northern France. Many were destroyed by aircraft, anti-aircraft guns or barrage balloons, but around 2500 fell on the capital - but almost the same number fell in Kent, and the area became known as Doodlebug Alley. The town of Deal was also the target for a 1989 attack by the IRA. Much of the north-west of the county is part of the London commuter belt. The Thames Gateway regeneration area includes riverside areas of north Kent as far east as Sittingbourne and largely to the north of the A2 road. Much of Kent, especially the Medway area, saw post-war migration from London. This was partly because of the heavy damage and destruction sustained by London in World War II. In 1998, Rochester, Chatham, Gillingham and Rainham left the administrative county of Kent to form the Unitary Authority of Medway, but remain in the ceremonial county of Kent. The two cities in Kent were Canterbury, the seat of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Rochester, the seat of the Bishop of Rochester. However, since 1998 when local government was reorganised, Rochester lost its official city status, thought at the time to be through an administrative oversight.. In 2018, it was reported that the loss of city status was not accidental. Man of Kent or Kentish Man? Kent is traditionally divided into East Kent and West Kent and such a division can be traced back at least as far as the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Kent. Those from the East are known as Men of Kent (or Maids of Kent) and those from the West as Kentish Men (or Kentish Maids). =Iron Age and Roman Period= Julius Caesar called Kent, Cantium, and the pre-Roman local tribe the Cantiaci subsequently become a civitas (unit of local administration) of Roman Britain, based at Durovernum Cantiacorum (modern Canterbury). The Germanic settlers adopted the Romano-British name of Cantium and this lends weight to the idea that civitas passed from British to Germanic (Jutish) hands with its structure essentially intact.Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England, Barbara Yorke Tellingly, the civitas territory may only have consisted of East Kent so the origins of the sub-divisions of Kent may thus exted back to the Iron Age. =Anglo-Saxon Period= The East and West Kentish identities date back at least as far as the Anglo-Saxon period. In the early days of the English church it was usual for kingdoms, even large ones like Mercia and Northumbria, to be served by just one diocese, but Kent was unique in having two, Rochester in the west, and Canterbury in the east. This seems to have reflected political divisions with eastern and western political units in place at that time. In the late 7th century, Kent is recorded as being under the control of co-Kings, one in the west (Swaefherd, of the East Saxon royal house) and one in the east ‚Äì both of these being under the overlordship of Aethelred of Mercia. These political divisions may reflect the varying ethnic make-up of the leadership of Kent at that time, the difference being between the Jutes who settled in the east and south of the county shortly after the Roman armies' departure early in the 5th century and the Angles and Saxon who may have settled in the west of the county slightly later, or simply a divided, decentralized Jutish kingdom. Modern DNA testing suggests the people of Kent have a greater genetic affinity with each other than persons from other counties in England. F. F. Smith's 1929 work A History of Rochester quotes a 1735 glossary by the Rev. Samuel Pegge on the subject: The history of early Anglo-Saxon England is very uncertain and prone to re-interpretation according to the fashion of the time. A Jutish elite may have formed their kingdom in the east, expelling or absorbing rival tribes and Jutish kings settling the land with their own followers until the kingdom reached its traditional borders, as was customary across Britain during the initial Anglo-Saxon invasions and settlement. Whatever the case, Jutish cultural influence was evident across the whole county by the Norman period. According to the BBC website,BBC - Kent Places - Man of Kent or Kentish Man? legend holds that a few hundred years later, it is said the Men of Kent resisted William the Conqueror more stoutly than the Kentish Men, who surrendered. A stone monument in the town of Swanscombe, erected in 1958, claims that both the Kentish Men & Men of Kent fought with equal ferocity to expel Duke William. =Boundaries and Usage= Kent is traditionally divided into East Kent and West Kent by the River Medway. However, some towns, such as the Medway Towns ‚Äì Rochester, Chatham and Gillingham (although Rainham was annexed from Swale, and is thus considered part of East Kent) and Maidstone ‚Äì lie on the east / south bank of the river. Further investigation also shows that the division is not, in fact, the river Medway, but lies further east in Gillingham, or, more precisely, at Rainham. Along the London road at Rainham is a small hamlet, now part of the town itself, known as Rainham Mark. Here once stood an ancient boundary stone, near The Hops and Vine public house ‚Äì formerly The Belisha Beacon ‚Äì and since replaced by a milestone that, traditionally, marks the division of Kent into its eastern and western zones. Edward Hasted, in his 1798 description of Rainham, writes: According to one local historian, Freddie Cooper, a former mayor of Gillingham, this division remained in force until 1 April 1929 when Rainham was transferred, despite protest, from the administration of Milton Rural District Council to that of Gillingham. F. F. Smith's 1929 work A History of Rochester quotes a 1735 glossary by the Rev. Samuel Pegge on the subject: One example of this traditional subdivision are Kent's two historic local regiments, the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment and the Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment), now both part of the Princess of Wales' Royal Regiment. Another is its two historical parliamentary constituencies, West Kent and East Kent. West Kent and East Kent each had their own Quarter Sessions until 1814, when the separate administrations of East and West Kent were merged. The West Kent Quarter Sessions Division was based in Maidstone and consisted of the Lathe of Aylesford, the Lathe of Sutton-at-Hone, and the lower division of the Lathe of Scray.Lewis, Topographical Dictionary of England, Vol. II, 1831 The East Kent Quarter Session, corresponding roughly to the Diocese of Canterbury, consisted of the three lathes: Lathe of St Augustine, Lathe of Shepway, and the upper division of the Lathe of Scray.Lewis Topographical Dictionary of England, Vol. II, 1831 The distinction between these two-halves of the county is perpetuated in the present-day by the Association of the Men of Kent and Kentish Men, an organisation formed in 1913. Places in East Kent include: *Broadstairs *Ashford *Canterbury *Deal *Dover *Faversham *Folkestone *Herne Bay *Margate *Ramsgate *Romney *Sandwich *Sheppey *Sittingbourne *Thanet *Whitstable Places in West Kent include: *Cranbrook *Dartford *Edenbridge *Gillingham *Gravesend *Hawkhurst *Headcorn *Maidstone *Northfleet *Rochester *Royal Tunbridge Wells *Sevenoaks *Swanley *Tenterden *Tonbridge *Westerham The historic area of West Kent included a number of places now in Greater London; specifically the London Boroughs of Bexley, Bromley, Greenwich and Lewisham, including: *Beckenham *Bexley *Biggin Hill *Bromley *Chislehurst *Deptford *Eltham *Greenwich *Lewisham *Orpington *Sidcup *Woolwich and North Woolwich Nickname Most English counties have nicknames for people from that county, such as a Tyke from Yorkshire and a Yellowbelly from Lincolnshire; the traditional nickname for people from Kent is \\"Kentish Long- Tail\\", deriving from the long-held belief on the continental mainland of Medieval Europe that the English had tails.

Biography  Alban Butler was born in 1710, at Appletree, Aston le Walls, Northamptonshire, the second son of Simon Butler, Esq. His father died when he was young and he was sent to the Lancashire boarding school ran by Dame Alice. He went on to a Catholic further education at the English College, Douai, in France. In 1735 Butler was ordained a priest. At Douai, he was appointed professor of philosophy, and later professor of theology. It was at Douai that he began his principal work The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs and Other Principal Saints. He also prepared material for Richard Challoner's Memoirs of Missionary Priests, a work on the martyrs of the reign of Elizabeth. In 1745, Butler came to the attention of the Duke of Cumberland, younger son of King George II, for his devotion to the wounded English soldiers during the defeat at the Battle of Fontenoy. Around 1746, Butler served as tutor and guide on the Grand Tour to James and Thomas Talbot, nephews of Gilbert Talbot, 13th Earl of Shrewsbury. Their elder brother, George, succeeded their uncle as 14th Earl of Shrewsbury. Both James and Thomas Talbot later became Catholic bishops. Ward, Bernard. The Dawn of the Catholic Revival in England, 1781-1803, Vol. 1, Longmans, Green, 1909, p. 19 He laboured for some time as a missionary priest in Staffordshire, and was finally appointed president of the English seminary at Saint Omer in France, where he remained until his death. Butler returned to England in 1749 and was made chaplain to the Duke of Norfolk, whose nephew and heir, the Hon. Edward Howard, Butler accompanied to Paris as tutor. While he was in Paris, Butler completed his Lives. During his term as President of the English seminary, Butler also served the bishops of Arras, Saint-Omer, Ypres, and Boulogne-Sur- Mer as their Vicar-General. Butler died in Saint-Omer in 1773 and was buried in the parish church of Saint-Denis. See An Account of the Life of A. B. by C. B., i.e. by his nephew Charles Butler (London, 1799); and Joseph Gillow's Bibliographical Dictionary of English Catholics, vol. i.  The Lives of Saints  The Lives of the Saints Butler's great work, The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs and Other Principal Saints (\\"Butler's Lives\\"), the result of thirty years' study, was first published in four volumes in London, 1756‚Äì1759. It is a popular and compendious reproduction of the Acta Sanctorum, exhibiting great industry and research, and is in all respects the best compendium of Acta in English. Butler's magnum opus has passed many editions and translations. = The first edition (1756‚Äì1759) = This edition was printed initially in 4 octavo volumes, with no stated publisher or author's name. However they were so thick that they were usually bound in more volumes. There were actually 6 title pages since Vol. 3 and Vol. 4 both have a \\"part II\\" issued thus: vol. I, vol. II, vol. III, vol. III part II, vol. IV, and vol. IV part II. Each \\"volume\\" contained three months of the liturgical calendar's Saints' lives. Vol. I also had a copperplate engraving with figures of the Roman devices of torture used, and a 2-page explanation of their use. Charles Butler's assertion that \\"all the notes\\" were left out of the first edition at the suggestion of Bishop Challoner is exaggerated. There are many useful, and even extended, notes in the first edition, but not to the extent that they appear in the second, and succeeding editions. According to Charles Knight, the 1847 edition published in twelve volumes is considered the best and most complete. =Modern editions= Since Fr.

According to contemporary Western press reports, most investors were aware of the fraudulent nature of the scheme, but still hoped to profit from it by withdrawing money before it collapsed. In 2011, MMM re-opened as \\"MMM Global\\". History MMM was established in 1989 by Sergei Mavrodi, his brother Vyacheslav Mavrodi, and Olga Melnikova. The name of the company was taken from the first letters of the three founders' surnames. Initially, Mavrodi operated a network of computer-importing cooperatives. In January 1992, tax police accused MMM of tax evasion, leading to the collapse of MMM-bank, and causing the company to have difficulty obtaining financing to support its operations. Faced with difficulties in funding its foreign trade, the company switched to the financial sector. It offered American stocks to Russian investors, but met with little success. In December 1992, MMM-Invest was created as a voucher investment fund, a type of entity created to collect privatization vouchers. It was renamed Russ-Invest in May 1995, to distance it from the MMM scheme. The MMM Ponzi scheme was launched in February 1994, promising annual returns of up to %. The company started an aggressive TV ad campaign, spending 330 million rubles in March 1994. The ad campaign appealed to the general public by using \\"ordinary\\" characters that viewers could identify with. The most famous of them, a \\"folk hero\\" of early 1994, was Lyonya Golubkov. Another notable marketing effort was a giveaway of free Metro trips to all Moscow citizens on a particular day. At its peak the company was taking in millions of dollars each day from the sale of its shares to the public. Mavrodi reportedly owned enough cash to pack several rooms full with banknotes. The success of MMM in attracting investors led to the creation of other similar companies, including Tibet, Chara, Khoper-Invest, Selenga, Telemarket, and Germes. All of these companies were characterised by aggressive television advertising and extremely high promised rates of return. One company promised annual returns of %. Regular publication in the media of the rising MMM share price led President Boris Yeltsin to issue a decree in June 1994 to protect investors from false advertising. On July 22, 1994, the Ministry of Finance issued a statement listing MMM among a number of investment firms which had illegally issued unregistered securities. Thousands of investors staged a mass protest in front of the company headquarters, prompting the intervention of riot police. By the next day, the firm was no longer operational. The company attempted to continue the scheme for a few days, and even issued new shares. As Russia did not have any laws against Ponzi schemes, the government decided to seek tax evasion charges. At that point, Invest-Consulting, one of the company's subsidiaries, owed more than 50 billion rubles in taxes (US$26 million), and MMM itself owed between 100 billion and 3 trillion rubles to the investors (from US$50 million to US$1.5 billion). MMM shares fell from 115,000 rubles to 1,000 rubles (about $0.50). In the aftermath, some investors reportedly threatened to set themselves on fire. Several organisations of \\"investors\\" made efforts to recover their lost investments, but Sergei Mavrodi manipulated their indignation and directed it at the government. Mavrodi was arrested on tax evasion charges, unrelated to the MMM scheme, on 4 August 1994. Most shareholders blamed the government for their losses. A 'Union of Defense of the Rights of MMM Shareholders' emerged, attempting to collect the 1 million signatures required to hold a no-confidence referendum against Yeltsin's government. In October 1994 Mavrodi managed to win a by-election to replace Andrey Aizderdzis in the State Duma, and with it immunity from prosecution. Mavrodi claimed to be the victim of jealous bureaucrats, and that MMM shares would regain their value if he was elected. During the campaign he was supported by Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who hoped that Mavrodi would provide him with future financial backing. After being elected he appeared in the State Duma only once, to vote against an attempt to strip him of parliamentary immunity. Mavrodi launched his own political party, the Party of People's Capital, but it was barred from registering after violating election laws. He decided to stage a protest against a decision, but this time only 200 people showed up. In October 1995, the Duma cancelled Mavrodi's right to immunity as a deputy. In 1996, he tried to run for Russia's presidency, but his bid was rejected after officials ruled that most of the signatures he submitted had been forged. MMM declared bankruptcy on September 22, 1997. The original investigation was closed in 1997 for lack of evidence. The Prosecutor General's Office reopened the case in 1998, when Mavrodi was investigated for fraud and placed on an international wanted list. While it was believed that Sergei Mavrodi fled to Greece, he was ultimately arrested in Moscow, and investigators concluded that he probably never left the city. Mavrodi was found and arrested in February 2003. While in custody, Mavrodi was given until January 31, 2006 to read the documents in his fraud case against him (the criminal case consisted of 650 volumes, each 250-270 pages long). At the end of April 2007, Mavrodi was convicted of fraud, and given a sentence of four- and-a-half years. Since he had already spent over four years in custody, he was released less than a month later, on May 22, 2007. Though no longer current, MMM Biletov share certificates, which bear a resemblance to banknotes and formerly issued in ‚Äòdenominations‚Äô of varying amounts, have gained some interest as collectors items. The MMM scandal led to increased regulation of the Russian stock market, but the legacy of the fraud led many to become extremely suspicious of any joint stock companies.  Fraud scheme in developing countries  From 2011, Mavrodi started targeting developing countries in Asia and Africa, promising 30% monthly returns and other promotional offers. It claimed that this was not a high-yield investment programme of HIYP. Rather it was mentioned on the website that a community of people were \\"selflessley helping each other\\" in a form of \\"Global Fund of mutual aid.\\" Participants were asked to send financial help to fellows with the promise that they would be helped when in need by returning a sum more than what they had sent. In India, for example, many victims of this scheme reported that once they sent the \\"help\\", they received messages saying that the system has restarted and that they couldn't access their investments anymore.

It has been among the country's largest and most economically and culturally important cities for eight centuries. The Bristol area has been settled since the Stone Age and there is evidence of Roman occupation. A mint was established in the Saxon burgh of Brycgstow by the 10th century and the town rose to prominence in the Norman era, gaining a charter and county status in 1373. The change in the form of the name 'Bristol' is due to the local pronunciation of 'ow' as 'ol'. Maritime connections to Wales, Ireland, Iceland, western France, Spain and Portugal brought a steady increase in trade in wool, fish, wine and grain during the Middle Ages. Bristol became a city in 1542 and trade across the Atlantic developed. The city was captured by Royalist troops and then recaptured for Parliament during the English Civil War. During the 17th and 18th centuries the transatlantic slave trade and the Industrial Revolution brought further prosperity. Edmund Burke, MP for Bristol, supported the American Revolution and free trade. Prominent reformers such as Mary Carpenter and Hannah More campaigned against the slave trade. The late 18th and early 19th centuries saw the construction of a floating harbour, advances in shipbuilding and further industrialisation with the growth of the glass, paper, soap and chemical industries aided by the establishment of Bristol as the terminus of the Great Western Railway by I. K. Brunel. In the early 20th century, Bristol was in the forefront of aircraft manufacture and the city had become an important financial centre and high technology hub by the beginning of the 21st century. Pre-Norman =Palaeolithic and Iron Age= There is evidence of settlement in the Bristol area from the palaeolithic era, with 60,000-year-old archaeological finds at Shirehampton and St Annes. Stone tools made from flint, chert, sandstone and quartzite have been found in terraces of the River Avon, most notably in the neighbourhoods of Shirehampton and Pill. There are Iron Age hill forts near the city, at Leigh Woods and Clifton Down on either side of the Avon Gorge, and at Kingsweston, near Henbury. Bristol was at that time part of the territory of the Dobunni. Evidence of Iron Age farmsteads has been found at excavations throughout Bristol, including a settlement at Filwood. There are also indications of seasonal occupation of the salt marshes at Hallen on the Severn estuary. =Roman era= During the Roman era there was a settlement named Abona at the present Sea Mills; this was important enough to feature in the 3rd-century Antonine Itinerary which documents towns and distances in the Roman empire, and was connected to Bath by a road. Archaeological excavations at Abona have found a street pattern, shops, cemeteries and wharves, indicating that the town served as a port. Another settlement at what is now Inns Court, Filwood, had possibly developed from earlier Iron Age farmsteads. There were also isolated villas and small settlements throughout the area, notably Kings Weston Roman Villa and another at Brislington. =Saxon era= A minster was founded in the 8th century at Westbury on Trym and is mentioned in a charter of 804. In 946 an outlaw named Leof killed Edmund I in a brawl at a feast in the royal palace at Pucklechurch, which lies about six miles from Bristol. The town of Bristol was founded on a low hill between the rivers Frome and Avon at some time before the early 11th century. The main evidence for this is a coin of Aethelred issued c. 1010. This shows that the settlement must have been a market town and the name Brycg stowe indicates \\"place by the bridge\\". It is believed that the Bristol L (the tendency for the local accent to add a letter L to the end of some words) is what changed the name Brycg stowe to the current name Bristol. It appears that St Peter's church, the remains of which stand in modern Castle Park, may have been another minster, possibly with 8th-century origins. By the time of Domesday the church held three hides of land, which was a sizeable holding for a mere parish church. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that in 1052 Harold Godwinson took ship to Brycgstow and later in 1062 he took ships from the town to subdue the forces of Gruffydd ap Llywelyn of Wales, indicating the status of the town as a port. Brycg stowe was a major centre for the Anglo-Saxon slave trade. Men, women and children captured in Wales or northern England were traded through Bristol to Dublin as slaves. From there the Viking rulers of Dublin would sell them on throughout the known world. The Saxon bishop of Worcester, Wulfstan, whose diocese included Bristol, preached against the trade regularly and eventually it was forbidden by the crown, though it carried on in secret for many years. Middle Ages =Norman era= Bristol Castle, as depicted on James Millerd's 1673 map of Bristol At some time after the Norman conquest of England in 1066 a motte-and- bailey was erected on the present site of Castle Park. Bristol was held by Geoffrey de Montbray, Bishop of Countances, one of the knights who accompanied William the Conqueror. William ordered stone castles to be built so it is likely that the first parts of Bristol Castle were built by Geoffrey in his reign. After the Conqueror's death (1087), Geoffrey joined the rebellion against William Rufus. Using Bristol as his headquarters, he burned Bath and ravaged Somerset before submitting to Rufus. He eventually returned to Normandy and died at Coutances in 1093. Rufus created the Honour of Gloucester, which included Bristol, from his mother Queen Matilda's estates and granted it to Robert Fitzhamon. Fitzhamon enlarged and strengthened Bristol castle and in the latter years of the 11th century conquered and subdued much of south and west Wales. His daughter Mabel was married in 1114 to Henry I's bastard son Robert of Caen. Her dowry was a large part of her father's Gloucestershire and Welsh estate and Robert of Caen became the first Earl of Gloucester, c. 1122. He is believed to have been responsible for completing Bristol castle. In 1135 Henry I died and the Earl of Gloucester rallied to the support of his sister Matilda against Stephen of Blois who had seized the throne on Henry's death. Stephen attempted to lay siege to Robert at Bristol in 1138 but gave up the attempt as the castle appeared impregnable. When Stephen was captured in 1141 he was imprisoned in the castle, but when Robert was captured by Stephen's forces, Matilda was forced to exchange Stephen for Robert. Her son Henry, later to become Henry II of England, was kept safe in the castle, guarded and educated by his uncle Robert. The castle was later taken into royal hands, and Henry III spent lavishly on it, adding a barbican before the main west gate, a gate tower, and magnificent hall. The Earl of Gloucester had founded the Benedictine priory of St James in 1137. In 1140 St Augustine's Abbey was founded by Robert Fitzharding, a wealthy Bristolian who had loyally supported the Earl and Matilda in the war. As a reward for this support he would later be made Lord of Berkeley. The abbey was a monastery of Augustinian canons. In 1148 the abbey church was dedicated by the bishops of Exeter, Llandaff, and St. Asaph, and during Fitzharding's lifetime the abbey also built the chapter house and gatehouse. In 1172, following the subjugation of the Pale in Ireland, Henry II gave Bristolians the right to reside in and trade from Dublin. The medieval Jewish community of Bristol was one of the more important in England. The Jews of Bristol were accused in a blood libel in 1183, but not many details are known. At the end of the 12th century, an archa was established in the city, without which Jews would not have been legally allowed to conduct business. In 1210, all Jewish householders in England were imprisoned in Bristol and a hefty levy of 60,000 or 66,000 marks was imposed on them. During the Second Barons' War, the city's archa was burned and the Jewish community was violently attacked. There was another attack in 1275, but without fatalities. The community was expelled with the rest of England's Jews in 1290. There is a surviving mikveh, Jewish ritual bath, from this time period now known as Jacob's Well. =Later Middle Ages= Church of St John the Baptist with the tower over the city gateway. By the 13th century Bristol had become a busy port. Woollen cloth became its main export during the fourteenth to fifteenth century, while wine from Gascony and Bordeaux, was the principal import. In addition the town conducted an extensive trade with the Anglo-Irish ports of southern Ireland, such as Waterford and Cork, as well as with Portugal.E.M. Carus Wilson, 'The overseas trade of Bristol' in E. Power & M.M. Postan (eds.), Studies in English Trade in the Fifteenth Century (London, 1933) From about 1420‚Äì1480 the port also traded with Iceland, from which it imported a type of freeze-dried cod called 'stockfish'.E.M. Carus-Wilson, 'The Iceland trade' in E. Power & M.M. Postan (eds.), Studies in English Trade in the Fifteenth Century (London, 1933) In 1147 Bristol men and ships had assisted in the Siege of Lisbon, which led to that city's recapture from the Moors. A stone bridge was built across the Avon, c. 1247 and between the years of 1240 and 1247 a Great Ditch was constructed in St Augustine's Marsh to straighten out the course of the River Frome and provide more space for berthing ships. Redcliffe and Bedminster were incorporated into the city in 1373. Edward III proclaimed \\"that the town of Bristol with its suburbs and precincts shall henceforth be separate from the counties of Gloucester and Somerset and be in all things exempt both by land by sea, and that it should be a county by itself, to be called the county of Bristol in perpetuity.\\" This meant that disputes could be settled in courts in Bristol rather than at Gloucester, or at Ilminster for areas south of the Avon which had been part of Somerset. The city walls extended into Redcliffe and across the eastern part of the march which now became the Town Marsh. The major surviving part of the walls is visible adjacent to the only remaining gateway under the tower of the Church of St John the Baptist. By the mid-14th century Bristol is considered to have been England's third-largest town (after London and York), with an estimated 15‚Äì20,000 inhabitants on the eve of the Black Death of 1348‚Äì49. The plague inflicted a prolonged demographic setback, with the population estimated at between 10,000 and 12,000 during the 15th and 16th centuries. One of the first great merchants of Bristol was William Canynge. Born c. 1399, he was five times mayor of the town and twice represented it as an MP. He is said to have owned ten ships and employed over 800 sailors. In later life he became a priest and spent a considerable part of his fortune in rebuilding St Mary Redcliffe church, which had been severely damaged by lightning in 1446. Bristol's overseas trade as recorded in 1492/3 customs accounts. The end of the Hundred Years War in 1453 meant that Britain, and thus Bristol, lost its access to Gascon wines and so imports of Spanish and Portuguese wines increased. Imports from Ireland included fish, hides and cloth (probably linen). Exports to Ireland included broadcloth, foodstuffs, clothing and metals. It has been suggested that the decline of Bristol's Iceland trade for 'stockfish' (freeze dried cod) was a hard blow to the local economy, encouraging Bristol merchants to turn west, launching unsuccessful voyages of exploration in the Atlantic by 1480 in search of the phantom island of Hy-Brazil.David Beers Quinn, 'England and the Discovery of America, 1480‚Äì1620 (London, 1974), pp. 47‚Äì50. More recent research, however, has shown that the Iceland trade was never more than a minor part of Bristol's overseas trade and that the English fisheries off Iceland actually increased during the late 15th and 16th centuries. In 1487, when king Henry VII visited the city, the inhabitants complained about their economic decline. Such complaints, however, were not uncommon among corporations that wished to avoid paying taxes, or which hoped to secure concessions from the Crown. In reality, Bristol's customs accounts show that the port's trade was growing strongly during the last two decades of the fifteenth century.E.M. Carus-Wilson, and Olive Coleman, England's Export Trade 1275‚Äì1547 (Oxford, 1963), pp. 142‚Äì43David Harris Sacks, The Widening Gate: Bristol and the Atlantic Economy, 1450‚Äì1700 (University of California Press, 1991), pp. 21‚Äì24. In great part this was due of the increase of trade with Spain.Wendy R. Childs, Anglo- Castilian Trade in the Later Middle Ages (Manchester, 1978)Evan T. Jones and Margaret M. Condon, Cabot and Bristol's Age of Discovery: The Bristol Discovery Voyages 1480‚Äì1508 (University of Bristol, Nov. 2016), pp. 37‚Äì38. The map of Bristol in The Maire of Bristowe is Kalendar. This was drawn by Robert Ricart after he became the common clerk of the town in 1478. His drawing was the first such plan of an English town. =Exploration= In 1497 Bristol was the starting point for John Cabot's voyage of exploration to North America. For many years Bristol merchants had bought freeze-dried cod, called stockfish, from Iceland for consumption in England. However the Hanseatic League, which was trying to control North Atlantic trade at this time, sought to cut off supplies to English merchants.E.M. Carus-Wilson, 'The Iceland trade' in E. Power & M.M. Postan (eds.), Studies in English Trade in the Fifteenth Century (London, 1933) It has often been suggested that this drove Bristol's merchants to look West for new sources of cod fish. On the other hand, while Bristol merchants did largely abandon Iceland in the late-15th century, Hull merchants continued to trade there.W.R. Childs, 'England's Icelandic trade in the fifteenth century: The role of the port of Hull' Northern Seas (1995) Moreover, recent research has shown that England's fisheries off Iceland actually grew significantly from the 1490s, albeit the centre for this activity shifted from Bristol to East Anglia. This makes it hard to sustain the argument that Bristol merchants were somehow 'pushed out' of Iceland. In 1481 two local men, Thomas Croft and John Jay, sent off ships looking for the mythical island of Hy-Brasil. There was no mention of the island being discovered but Croft was prosecuted for illegal exports of salt, on the grounds that, as a customs officer, he should not have engaged in trade.J.A. Williamson, The Cabot Voyages and Bristol Discovery Under Henry VII (Hakluyt Society, Second Series, No. 120, CUP, 1962), p. 20 Professor David Beers Quinn, whose theories form the basis for a variety of popular histories, suggested that the explorers may have discovered the Grand Banks off Newfoundland, waters rich in cod.D.B. Quinn, England and the Discovery of America, 1481‚Äì1620 (London, 1974) John Cabot was sponsored by Henry VII on his voyage in 1497, looking for a new route to the Orient. Having discovered North America instead, on his return Cabot spoke of the great quantities of cod to be found near the new land.Letter: Raimondo de Raimondi de Soncino, Milanese Ambassador in England, to Ludvico Maria Sforza, Duke of Milan, 18 December 1497 In 1498 Cabot set sail again from Bristol with an expedition of five ships and is believed to have never returned from this voyage, although recent research conducted at the University of Bristol, suggests that he might have. From 1499 to 1508 a number of other expeditions were launched from Bristol to the 'New found land', the earliest being undertaken by William Weston. One of these, led by John Cabot's son, Sebastian Cabot, explored down the coast of North America until he was ‚Äòalmost in the latitude of Gibraltar‚Äô and ‚Äòalmost the longitude of Cuba‚Äô. This would suggest that he reached as far as the Chesapeake, close to what is now Washington D.C.J.A. Williamson, The Cabot Voyages and Bristol Discovery Under Henry VII (Hakluyt Society, Second Series, No. 120, Cambridge University Press, 1962), pp. 266‚Äì69. Early modern =Tudor and Stuart periods= thumb Bristol was made a city in 1542, with the former Abbey of St Augustine becoming Bristol Cathedral, following the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII.Joseph Bettey, St Augustine's Abbey, Bristol (Bristol Branch of the Historical Association 1996), pp. 7, 11‚Äì15, 21, 24‚Äì25. The Dissolution also saw the surrender to the king of all of Bristol's friaries and monastic hospitals, together with St James' Priory, St Mary Magdalen nunnery, a Cistercian abbey at Kingswood and the College at Westbury on Trym. In the case of the friaries at Greyfriars and Whitefriars, the priors had fled before the arrival of the royal commissioners, and at Whitefriars a succession of departing priors had plundered the friary of its valuables. Although the commissioners had not been able to point to as much religious malpractice in Bristol as elsewhere, there is no record of Bristolians raising any objections to the royal seizures. In 1541 Bristol's civic leaders took the opportunity of buying up lands and properties formerly belonging to St Mark's Hospital, St Mary Magdalen, Greyfriars and Whitefriars for a total of a thousand pounds. Bristol thereby became the only municipality in the country which has its own chapel, at St Mark's. Bristol Grammar School was established in 1532 by the Thorne family and in 1596 John Carr established Queen Elizabeth's Hospital, a bluecoat school charged with 'the education of poor children and orphans'. Trade continued to grow: by the mid-16th century imports from Europe included, wine, olive oil, iron, figs and other dried fruits and dyes; exports included cloth (both cotton and wool), lead and hides. Many of the city's leading merchants were involved in smuggling at this time, illicitly exporting goods like foodstuffs and leather, while under- declaring imports of wine.Jones, Evan T., 'Illicit business: accounting for smuggling in mid-sixteenth century Bristol' , Economic History Review, 54 (2001). Jones, Evan T., Inside the Illicit Economy: Reconstructing the Smugglers' Trade of Sixteenth Century Bristol (Ashgate, June 2012) In 1574 Elizabeth I visited the city during her Royal Progress through the western counties. The city burgesses spent over one thousand pounds on preparations and entertainments, most of which was raised by special rate assessments. In 1577 the explorer Martin Frobisher arrived in the city with two ships and samples of ore, which proved to be worthless. He also brought, according to Latimer \\"three savages, doubtless Esqiumaux, clothed in deerskins, but all of them died within a month of their arrival.\\" Bristol sent three ships to the Royal Navy fleet against the Spanish Armada in 1588, and also supplied two levies of men to the defending land forces. Despite appeals to the Privy Council no reimbursement was made for these supplies. The corporation also had to repair the walls and gates of the city. The castle had fallen into disuse in the late Tudor era, but the City authorities had no control over royal property and the precincts became a refuge for lawbreakers. =English Civil War= In 1630 the city corporation bought the castle and when the First English Civil War broke out in 1642, the city took the Parliamentary side and partly restored the fortifications. However Royalist troops under the command of Prince Rupert captured Bristol on 26 July 1643, in the process causing extensive damage to both town and castle. The Royalist forces captured large amounts of booty and also eight armed merchant vessels which became the nucleus of the Royalist fleet. Workshops in the city became arms factories, providing muskets for the Royalist army. In the summer of 1645, Royalist forces were defeated by the New Model Army at the Battle of Langport, in Somerset. Following further victories at Bridgwater and Sherborne, Sir Thomas Fairfax marched on Bristol. Prince Rupert returned to organise the defence of the city. The Parliamentary forces besieged the city and after three weeks attacked, eventually forcing Rupert to surrender on 10 September. The First Civil War ended the following year. There were no further military actions in Bristol during the second and third civil wars. In 1656, Oliver Cromwell ordered the destruction of the castle. In 1634, John Whitson established a school for girls, \\"to be apparelled in red\\", henceforth known as The Red Maids' School =Slave trade= William de la Founte, a wealthy Bristol merchant has been identified as the first recorded English slave traders. Of Gascon origin, in 1480 he was one of the four venturers granted a licence \\"to trade in any parts\\". Renewed growth came with the 17th-century rise of England's American colonies and the rapid 18th-century expansion of Bristol's part in the \\"Triangular trade\\" in Africans taken for slavery in the Americas. Over 2000 slaving voyages were made by Bristol ships between the late 17th century and abolition in 1807, carrying an estimated half a million people from Africa to the Americas in brutal conditions. Average profits per voyage were seventy percent and more than fifteen per cent of the Africans transported died or were murdered on the Middle Passage. Some slaves were brought to Bristol, from the Caribbean; notable among these were Scipio Africanus, buried at Henbury and Pero Jones brought to Bristol by slave trader and plantation owner John Pinney. The slave trade and the consequent demand for cheap brass ware for export to Africa caused a boom in the copper and brass manufacturing industries of the Avon valley, which in turn encouraged the progress of the Industrial Revolution in the area. Prominent manufacturers such as Abraham Darby and William Champion developed extensive works between Conham and Keynsham which used ores from the Mendips and coal from the North Somerset coalfield. Water power from tributaries of the Avon drove the hammers in the brass batteries, until the development of steam power in the later 18th century. Glass, soap, sugar, paper and chemical industries also developed along the Avon valley. Edmund Burke was elected as Whig Member of Parliament for Bristol in 1774 and campaigned for free trade, Catholic emancipation and the rights of the American colonists, but he angered his merchant sponsors with his detestation of the slave trade and lost the seat in 1780. Anti- slavery campaigners, inspired by Non-conformist preachers such as John Wesley, started some of the earliest campaigns against the practice. Prominent local opponents of both the trade and the institution of slavery itself included Anne Yearsley, Hannah More, Harry Gandey, Mary Carpenter, Robert Southey, William Wordsworth and Samuel Coleridge. The campaign itself proved to be the beginning of movements for reform and women's emancipation. 18th and 19th centuries The Bristol Corporation of the Poor was established at the end of the 17th century and a workhouse, to provide work for the poor and shelter for those needing charity, was established, adjacent to the Bridewell. John Wesley founded the very first Methodist Chapel, The New Room in Broadmead in 1739, which is still in use in the 21st century. Wesley had come to Bristol at the invitation of George Whitfield. He preached in the open air to miners and brickworkers in Kingswood and Hanham. Kingswood is the site of a recent archaeological excavation 2014) which uncovered the diversity of artisans living in the area at the time. Bristol Bridge, the only way of crossing the river without using a ferry, was rebuilt between 1764 and 1768. The earlier medieval bridge was too narrow and congested to cope with the amount of traffic that needed to use it. A toll was charged to pay for the works, and when, in 1793, the toll was extended for a further period of time the Bristol Bridge Riot ensued. 11 people were killed and 45 injured, making it one of the worst riots of the 18th century. Competition from Liverpool from 1760, the disruption of maritime commerce through war with France (1793) and the abolition of the slave trade (1807) contributed to the city's failure to keep pace with the newer manufacturing centres of the North and Midlands. The cotton industry failed to develop in the city; sugar, brass and glass production went into decline. Abraham Darby left Bristol for Coalbrookdale when his advanced ideas for iron production received no backing from local investors. Buchanan and Cossons cite \\"a certain complacency and inertia [from the prominent mercantile families] which was a serious handicap in the adjustment to new conditions in the Industrial Revolution period.\\" The long passage up the heavily tidal Avon Gorge, which had made the port highly secure during the Middle Ages, had become a liability which the construction of a new \\"Floating Harbour\\" (designed by William Jessop) in 1804‚Äì09 failed to overcome. Nevertheless, Bristol's population (61,000 in 1801) grew fivefold during the 19th century, supported by growing commerce. It was particularly associated with the leading engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel, who designed the Great Western Railway between Bristol and London, two pioneering Bristol-built steamships, the SS Great Western and the SS Great Britain, and the Clifton Suspension Bridge. A map of Bristol published in 1866. The new middle class, led by those who agitated against the slave trade, in the city began to engage in charitable works. Notable were Mary Carpenter, who founded ragged schools and reformatories, and George M√ºller who founded an orphanage in 1836. Badminton School was started in Badminton House, Clifton in 1858 and Clifton College was established in 1862. University College, the predecessor of the University of Bristol, was founded in 1876 and the former Merchant Venturers Navigation School became the Merchant Venturers College in 1894. This later formed the nucleus of Bristol Polytechnic, which in turn became the University of the West of England. The Bristol Riots of 1831 took place after the House of Lords rejected the second Reform Bill. Local magistrate Sir Charles Wetherall, a strong opponent of the Bill, visited Bristol to open the new Assize Courts and an angry mob chased him to the Mansion House in Queen Square. The Reform Act was passed in 1832 and the city boundaries were expanded for the first time since 1373 to include \\"Clifton, the parishes of St. James, St. Paul, St. Philip, and parts of the parishes of Bedminster and Westbury\\". The parliamentary constituencies in the city were revised in 1885 when the original Bristol (UK Parliament constituency) was split into four. Bristol lies on one of the UK's lesser coalfields, and from the 17th century collieries opened in Bristol, and what is now North Somerset and South Gloucestershire. Though these prompted the construction of the Somerset Coal Canal, and the formation of the Bristol Miners' Association, it was difficult to make mining profitable, and the mines closed after nationalisation. At the end of the 19th century the main industries were tobacco and cigarette manufacture, led by the dominant W.D. & H.O. Wills company, paper and engineering. The port facilities were migrating downstream to Avonmouth and new industrial complexes were founded there. Bristol Bridge seen across the Harbour Modern history The British and Colonial Aeroplane Company, which later became the Bristol Aeroplane Company, then part of the British Aircraft Corporation and finally BAE Systems, was founded by Sir George White, owner of Bristol Tramways in 1910. During World War I production of the Bristol Scout and the Bristol F.2 Fighter established the reputation of the company. The main base at Filton is still a prominent manufacturing site for BAE Systems in the 21st century. The Bristol Aeroplane Company's engine department became a subsidiary company Bristol Aero Engines, then Bristol Siddeley Engines; and were bought by Rolls-Royce Limited in 1966, to become Rolls-Royce plc which is still based at Filton. Shipbuilding in the city docks, predominately by Charles Hill & Sons, formerly Hilhouse, remained important until the 1970s. Other prominent industries included chocolate manufacturers J. S. Fry & Sons and wine and sherry importers John Harvey & Sons. Bristol City F.C. (formed in 1897) joined the Football League in 1901 and became runners up in the First Division in 1906 and losing FA Cup finalists in 1909. Rivals Bristol Rovers F.C. (formed in 1883) joined the league in 1920. Gloucestershire County Cricket Club was formed in 1870 and have been runners up in the County Championship many times since. Bristol City Council built over 15,000 houses between 1919 and 1939, enabling clearance of some of the worst slums in the city centre. The new estates were at Southmead, Knowle, Filwood Park, Sea Mills and Horfield. The city boundaries were extended to north and south to accommodate this growth. In 1926, the Portway, a new road along the Avon Gorge built at a cost of around ¬£800,000, was opened linking the floating harbour to the expanding docks at Avonmouth. As the location of aircraft manufacture and a major port, Bristol was a target of bombing during the Bristol Blitz of World War II. Bristol's city centre also suffered severe damage, especially in November and December 1940, when the Broadmead area was flattened, and Hitler claimed to have destroyed the city. The original central area, near the bridge and castle, is still a park featuring two bombed out churches and some fragments of the castle. Slightly to the north, the Broadmead shopping centre and Cabot Circus were built over bomb-damaged areas. As with other British cities, there was immigration from various Commonwealth countries in the post war years, which did lead to some racist tension. In 1963, a colour bar operated by Bristol Omnibus Company, which at that time refused to employ Black or Asian bus crews, was successfully challenged in the Bristol Bus Boycott, which was considered to have been instrumental in the eventual passage of the Race Relations Act 1968. In 1980 a police raid on a cafe in St Paul's sparked the St Pauls riot, which highlighted the alienation of the city's ethnic minorities. Bristol aviation continued to develop in post war years. The Bristol Brabazon was a large trans-Atlantic airliner built in the late 1940s, based on developments in heavy bombers during the World War, but it received no sales orders and never went into production. Concorde, the first supersonic airliner was built in the 1960s, first flying in 1969. The aircraft never achieved commercial success, but its development did lay the foundation for the successful Airbus series of airliners, parts of which are produced at Filton in the 21st century. In the 1980s the financial services sector became a major employer in the city and surrounding areas, such as the business parks on the northern fringe of what was now referred to as Greater Bristol or the Bristol Urban Area comprising the city, Easton-in-Gordano, Frampton Cottrell and Winterbourne, Kingswood, Mangotsfield and Stoke Gifford. High technology companies such as IBM, Hewlett Packard, Toshiba, and Orange, along with creative and media enterprises become significant local employers as traditional manufacturing industries declined. Like much of British post- war planning, regeneration of Bristol city centre was characterised by large, cheap tower blocks, brutalist architecture and expansion of roads. Since the 1990s this trend has been reversed, with the closure of some main roads and the regeneration of the Broadmead shopping centre. In 2006 one of the city centre's tallest post-war blocks was torn down. Social housing tower blocks have also been demolished to be replaced by low rise homes. The removal of the docks to Avonmouth, seven miles (11 km) downstream from the city centre, relieved congestion in the central zone of Bristol and allowed substantial redevelopment of the old central dock area (the Floating Harbour) in the late 20th century. The deep-water Royal Portbury Dock was developed opposite Avonmouth Docks in the 1970s and following privatisation of the Port of Bristol has become financially successful. At one time the continued existence of the old central docks was in jeopardy as it was seen merely as derelict industry rather than an asset to be developed for public use. Since the 1980s millions of pounds have been spent regenerating the harbourside. 1999 saw the redevelopment of the city centre and the construction of Pero's footbridge; which now links the At-Bristol science centre at Canon's Marsh, opened in 2000, with other Bristol tourist attractions. Private investors are also constructing studio apartment buildings. The regeneration of the Canon's Marsh area is expected to cost ¬£240 million. Crest Nicholson were the lead developers constructing 450 new flats, homes and waterside offices, under the guidance of The Harbourside Sponsors‚Äô Group which is a partnership between the City Council, developers, businesses, and public funders.

In the GM brands hierarchy, Buick was surpassed in luxury and comfort appointments only by Cadillac, which did not produce performance models. As a result, the Buick GS series were the most opulently equipped GM sport models of their era. Skylark based Gran Sports The 1965 Skylark Gran Sport was the intermediate Buick Skylark with the Gran Sport option added. Although a V8 was already offered in the Skylark, the Gran Sport had the largest engine permitted by GM - a Buick V8 (called a 400 by Buick because that was the maximum engine size allowed in intermediate body cars). This engine produced 325 hp (242 kW) and 445 lb¬∑ft (603 Nm) and was known as the \\"nailhead\\" engine. Buick sold more than 15,000 Skylarks with the Gran Sport option that first year, and almost as many the next. It was renamed the GS 400 in 1967, and the Gran Sport became its own model in (about) that same year along with a new \\"400\\" engine quite different from the famously reliable but becoming-obsolete nailhead engine design that was first introduced in 1953. Sales fell somewhat in the face of increasingly higher-performance and more popular muscle cars from other marques when compared to those from the more stodgy and expensive Buick. Buick, however, stepped it up a notch when introducing the Stage 1 option in 1969. This limited production (less than 1,500 cars in 1969) version delivered 340 hp (253 kW) and 440 lb¬∑ft (597 Nm). The name Gran Sport replaced the GS moniker with the 1973 Gran Sport, and was again revived in the late eighties on the FWD Skylark model with various performance options added. =GS California= A rare GS California in a shopping center in Weeki Wachee, Florida. Buick touted the California as \\"The Distinctive Personal Car for Americana on the GO\\", using the Skylark platform. The merchandising creation of the West Coast's Mickey Garrett, the California GS became one of Buick's entries into what is now often known as a junior musclecar. The intent of these autos were to provide the visual impact of the era's supercars with the low maintenance and price of a more economical car, while maintaining reasonable performance levels. When reviewed with these thoughts in mind the California GS delivered quite nicely. They were fitted with the small block GS drivetrain and the exterior received the full treatment including vinyl top, chrome moulding package, GS emblems, and special California scripts. This marketing approach was also used in Colorado, using the \\"Colorado\\" name instead of \\"California\\".1969 Buick GS Colorado, www.flickr.comA Brief History of the GS Colorado, Ken's Buick GS Home Page Retrieved 18 June 2017 1967 was the maiden year for the California GS. It was available in California only and was not advertised nationally by Buick. Built on the thin-pillar coupe chassis it came equipped with the 340 ci/260 hp engine and Super Turbine 300 transmission. Bench seats were standard and accessories were kept to a minimum to help keep the price down. Car Life tested one in their June issue and ran the 1/4 in 16.7 seconds at 81 mph, they also recorded a top speed of 105 mph. The article contains a lengthy description of the car and how it performed during testing, it is a must read for anyone interested in learning more about the '67 California GS. Mid year 1968 saw the official introduction of the California GS, and it is frequently known as a '69 model.Guide to Muscle Cars Magazine, 2/87, p.64. Buick asked \\"Why settle for less when the California GS, built especially for YOU, costs no more?\\" Exclusively designed for Golden State motorists, Buick advertised the car nationally as a high performance family sports car at an economy car price. Though the car was not included in Buick's yearly catalog it was shown in a two-page black and white fold out brochure. Custom California GS emblems again graced the rear fenders while GS ornamentation could be found in the grille and sail panels. The drivetrain included Buick's new for '68 350-4 V8 with 10.25:1 compression and Rochester (GM) 4GC Quadrajet four-barrel (four-choke) carburetor,Guide to Muscle Cars Magazine, 2/87, p.62. producing 280 hp and 375 lb¬∑ft of torque. The two-speed Super Turbine 300 transmission (driving a 3.23:1 rear axle gear, designed for highway cruising) and bench seat interior were again the only choices. Buick also added chrome plated wheels and air cleaner lid to the two-door thin pillar coupe. Tires were on rims. 1969 was the last year of production for the California GS. The car was for the first time featured in Buick's big brochure. A two-page color picture of the thin pillar coupe and pictures of the again standard bench seat interior were included along with equipment descriptions. Tom McCahill tested the car and recorded a 0‚Äì60 mph time of 9.5 seconds and a top speed of 110 mph. Again the car came with Buick's 280 hp 350-4 engine but now it was mated to the new Turbo 350 transmission. Custom California emblems again graced the rear fenders, and the rear marker lights were plain red without Buick's normal 350 or 400 script. Vinyl tops, as with previous years, were standard fare with the California's distinctive GS logo on the sail panel. =Gran Sport 340/350= In 1967 Buick added a version, there was the GS 340 and the GS California sub-model, little more than the Skylark hardtop with new badging and trim,Flory, J. \\"Kelly\\", Jr. American Cars 1960-1972 (Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Coy, 2004), p.484. The 340 produced and 365 lb¬∑ft (495 Nm), and less than 4,000 cars were sold. It was replaced the next year with the GS 350 and similar GS California; these used Buick's small- block engine. A California 2-door coupe appeared in 1969;Flory, p.641. total GS sales for the year, not counting the new California coupe, were 12,465 (4,933 GS 350s, 7,532 GS 400s). Sales of the GS 350 for 1970 climbed to 9,948;Flory, p.718. in addition, 10,148 2-doors were built. The Gran Sport 350 outlived its big brothers, lasting until V8 Gran Sport production stopped in 1975, replaced by the Gran Sport 231. =Gran Sport 400= 1969 Buick Skylark GS 400 convertible In 1968 and 1969 Buick offered the GS 400 in a convertible and hardtop model. Standard issue of the GS 400 was a 400 cubic inch (6.6 L) engine (with likely lower stated horsepower rating to keep insurance premiums lower) of 340 horsepower (350 hp stage 1 ) and 440 ft. lbs. torque, a four barrel Rochester Quadrajet carburetor, dual exhaust, 2.93 standard gear ratio optional ( limited slip differential, (3.64 stage 1 option, 3.42 with A/C ), and the available three speed turbo Super Turbine 400 automatic transmission (revered as the finest automatic transmission ever built, and commonly called Turbo Hydra-matic 400), U-shape Hurst (automatic transmission) shifter and linkage, located on a center console. A 1968 or 1969 GS400 equipped with the TH400 auto transmission was faster off the line than many of its contemporaries thanks to an unusually \\"low\\" 1st gear. Shift pattern for the TH400 from most forward position is Park, Reverse, Neutral, Drive, Second, First. A standard three-speed or optional four-speed manual gearbox was also available. Compression ratio on this engine was a moderately high 10.25:1, which allowed for the use of any grade gasoline to be used in normal driving without pinging. The factory air cleaner was covered with a large round chromed cover, secured with a wing nut. The small air scoop behind the hood hinge-line on the 1968 model was generally fake, although it could be functional if ordered with the very rare ram air package. 1969 brought ram air as standard to the GS. Like all of the GM versions of this body style in this period, the convertible chassis was considerably more robust than the hardtop version. In fact, the convertible chassis was a full box frame chassis that had numerous lightening holes. The hardtop chassis was a 3/4 box frame with no lightening holes. The only GM hardtop ever built with the \\"Swiss cheese\\" convertible chassis was the GTO Judge. Same chassis. All of the GS400 convertibles were built at GM's Fremont, California assembly line. =Gran Sport 455= Buick GS 455 convertible The 400 was replaced for 1970 with the Buick V8 engine, used in the GS 455. The base model was rated at and at 2800 rpm of torque. In the optional Stage 1 trim equipped with a single 4-barrel Rochester Quadrajet carburetor was rated at SAE gross at 4600 rpm and at 2800 rpm of torque. As with all American engines produced prior to the 1972 model year, these were SAE gross ratings, which are generally significantly higher than SAE net ratings and are not indicative of what actual production engines produce in their \\"as installed\\" condition (with all engine accessories and full exhaust system in place). The fastest magazine test results from this period were obtained by MOTOR TREND Magazine, which managed to extract a 13.38 ET at 105.5 mph from their 3,810 pound GS Stage 1 coupe test car. Using Hale's Trap Speed formula, this result indicated actual \\"as installed\\" peak HP of approximately 360 SAE Net (ironically the same as its advertised Gross Figure, meaning this engine was very conservatively rated for that time period). Dennis Manner, Buick Engine development engineer still recalls the production- line pulled engine dyno test results from 1970 where the lowest HP output of the 15 tested 455 Stage 1 engines was 376 hp. The December 2004 issue of Musclecar Enthusiast magazine conducted an engine dynamometer test of a freshly rebuilt and well documented 1970 455 Stage 1 (bored .040\\" over to 464 cubic inches and minus the power-robbing factory engine fan, air cleaner assembly and mufflers). In that condition and with factory timing and carburetor tuning, the engine produced a maximum of 360.9 Gross Horsepower. Optimal carburetor and ignition tuning yielded a peak Gross HP reading of 381.7 HP - again with no engine fan, air cleaner or mufflers in place. While urban legend would have us believe that these engines made \\"420 HP from the factory,\\" actual empirical results prove otherwise. Although another dynamometer test on a 1970 Skylark GS Stage I showed 471 SAE gross hp, which is more consistent with the engine producing about 360 SAE net hp. The Stage 1 engine option used cylinder heads that, while using raw castings of the same pattern as all of the other Buick 455s sharing the same model year, were machined differently in order to accept larger valves (2.13\\" intake and 1.755\\" exhaust), and to produce smaller compression chambers for increased static compression ratio. The option also included a more aggressive camshaft, a specially tuned 4-barrel Quadrajet carburetor, more aggressive ignition timing,5/8 inch oil pickup tube and a higher numerical final drive, and was available with either Turbo Hydra-matic 400 3-speed automatic transmission, or a Muncie M-22 4-speed manual transmission (although it was later discovered, and confirmed, that one 1970 GS Stage 1 convertible was produced with a 3-speed manual and a standard 3.64:1 Positraction axle ratio). Stage 1 cars equipped with air conditioning received a 3.42 axle ratio. While powerful in production form, the Buick 455 (including Stage 1) engines had problematic engine blocks. All used 2 bolt main bearing caps; the oiling system was undersized for high-rpm use (including Stage 1 engines) and thin walls in the lifter valleys promoted cracking. The magic of the Stage 1, it would seem, was primarily attributable to its advanced (for the period) cylinder heads, stunningly high torque and the relatively high mid-range horsepower they produced. The relatively unknown, very expensive, and very rare 1970 GS 455 Stage 1 drew a great amount of attention and controversy in the muscle-car world when in the 1980s it was listed as faster than any of the Chrysler Hemi cars in the original \\"50 fastest muscle cars\\" list. This Hemi vs. Stage 1 controversy has prompted several contests to settle the issue; it remains an unsettled matter and has been a great boon to car magazine sales over the years. Buick GS Stage 2. There was also a rare ‚ÄúStage 2‚Äù option produced. This was a dealer-installed package (known as a \\"dealer option\\"), first offered in 1969. It included a cam, headers, intake manifold, high compression forged pistons, hollow pushrods, and some calibration changes to the ignition and carburetor . In 1970(?) the Stage 2 package was designed for the 455 and included special round exhaust port Stage 2 heads, matching Kustom brand headers, a radical cam, high compression forged pistons, Edelbrock B4B aluminum intake, Holley carburetor #4781 850 cfm, and other equipment for racing. Few Stage 2s even exist and Buick only ever factory assembled 1 Stage 2 test unit, it was a factory GSX clone test mule with 4-speed manual transmission used for speed testing. That GSX test mule was equipped with 4.78 gearing and was driven on the streets and tracks on the West Coast. The Stage 2 package's existence was not made public until 1972 when the Stage 2 parts could be ordered in any combination. There is little documentation about any Stage 2 cars that were sold. Three are known to exist and all three of these cars were built as Stage 1 cars at the factory. One was owned by Kenne-Bell a factory backed Buick high performance specialist based in California . Sponsored by Reynolds Buick .This car was used as a test car in the development of the Stage 2 components in conjunction with Buick engineering . The second Stage 2 was known as the Jones-Benisek car. The Jones/Benisek car is known to have been delivered as a Stage 1 car .The Stage 2 hood and scoop was added later . The Stage 2 iron heads were purchased by the owner at a local Buick Dealer. The car had a very successful drag racing career with many wins and some world records also. The third Stage 2 is known as Wiley Coyote and as the Turner car. It was originally owned by Bob Thetford and campaigned as \\"Wiley Coyote\\" in the NHRA. Sponsored by Kenne-Bell and Dunn Buick in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Later it was owned by Jim Turner and was very successful in NMCA winning 5 National Records. Output and sales for the assembly-line cars were down after 1970 largely due to reduced engine compression ratios and a change from gross to net horsepower ratings. In later years, air quality regulations further limited the power in part due to the addition of catalytic converters and single exhaust pipes. However, Stage 2 parts were available over the Buick parts counter although the Stage 2 heads were discontinued after about 75 sets were produced. The discontinuation was due to porosity problems with castings. The discontinuation of the Stage 2 also was due to the ever-tightening emission standards which resulted in lower performance. =GSX= 1970 GSX 455 Stage 1 in Apollo white GSX / GSX Stage 1 was Buick's contribution to the Classic era American Muscle car list, based on the GS455 which was in turn based on the Skylark platform adding an appearance, performance and handling package available starting in the 1970 model year. The GSX Performance and Handling package was a $1,100 option on the GS455. The GSX was Buick‚Äôs attempt to increase showroom traffic on a newly designed Skylark body style for 1970 which started off slow but sales improved. The GSX was Buick's answer to Pontiac's GTO Judge, Oldsmobile's 4-4-2 W-30, and Chevrolet's Chevelle SS. Buick advertised it as \\"A Brand New Brand Of Buick\\" and \\"Another 'Light Your Fire' Car From Buick\\". It came standard with a 455ci engine with or without the optional Stage 1 performance engine upgrades during the first year of release. Although near the top of GM's brand hierarchy, the GSX hardtop's basic bodyshell was the same as the lower-priced 1970 Chevrolet Chevelle but with differing guards, grill, bumpers, doors, etc, while Pontiac and Oldsmobile midsize hardtop coupes shared a slightly different body. In Saturn Yellow '72 GSX Rear view Due to the late introduction of the GSX, a very special prototype was displayed at the Chicago Motor Show in February 1970 to test consumer reaction. This particular GSX had Mother Of Pearl white paint, a special fiberglass/steel ram air hood with unique modified hood scoops, one-off 3 piece rear spoiler and a prototype front spoiler, custom multicolored leather interior featuring checkerboard black and white X patterned seats and door panels. It became a hit and production started with the factory GSX looking slightly different than the prototype GSX. The GSX did not appear in the standard model catalog for 1970, however a GSX pamphlet was made available to the public. A four page, full size pamphlet announced the GSX with artist drawn pictures and specifications. Only 678 GSXs were produced in the second half of the 1970 model year beginning in March 1970. and ending in May of 1970. Just 278 were equipped with the standard 455, a further 400 purchasers selected the optional Stage 1 performance package. The impressive performance is partly due to the light weight of the 455 which is roughly less than the 426 Hemi or Chevrolet 454. At 510 lb-ft the Buick 455 produced the highest torque output of any American production performance car, a record held for 33 years until finally surpassed by the Series 2 V10 Viper in 2003. The 1970 Buick GSX has, without doubt, the most extensive list of standard equipment high performance features of any classic era muscle car. It is this last fact that truly sets the GSX in a class of its own when compared to its late '60s - early '70s peers. Every single 1970 GSX Stage 1 produced received the full list of performance and handling parts. You could buy a poorly optioned Chevelle SS, a leaf-sprung, bench seat Hemi Roadrunner or even a Pontiac GTO Judge with the smaller 400ci engine and drum brakes, but there is no such thing as an under-equipped 1970 GSX. In 1970, the GSX option was available in only two colors, Saturn Yellow and Apollo White and always with the 455ci stump-puller and black interior (in 1971 and 1972 6 other colors were available for the GSX). All GSXs had the distinctive full body length black stripe that crossed over the standard equipment rear spoiler and was outlined in red pin stripes. A large area of the hood was also black with a hood mounted tachometer (Buick engineers disliked the hood tachometer because it was a Pontiac part) and black front spoiler. Also standard equipment were black bucket seats, floor shifter, wide oval tires, quick ratio steering and anti-sway bars front and rear and quad- link suspension attached to a limited-slip rear differential. Some other options were automatic transmission or four speed manual, A/C or Non-A/C. Restored matching numbers versions have sold in Barrett-Jackson's and Mecum auctions for as much as $200,000. During 1971 and 1972, the GSX package became an option that was available on any Gran Sport. Production dropped in 1971 to only 124, and again to 44 in 1972. These numbers include the available 350-4 bbl option, the standard 455, and the Stage 1 engines. Many GSXs survive to this day and can be seen at the Buick Gran Sport Nationals held annually in Bowling Green, KY in the middle of May (for the past number of years this time had been changed to September because of weather concerns) along with many other examples of '60s, '70s and '80s Buick performance models. Another Buick event is the Buick Performance Group Nationals which is held at National Trail Raceway in Columbus, Ohio early during the month of August each year. Other Gran Sports =Riviera GS= 1968 Riviera GS The Riviera Gran Sport was a high-performance luxury version of the Buick Riviera, produced from 1965 through 1975. In 1965, it was called Riviera Gran Sport and the later models were still officially called Gran Sport but showed GS badges instead of Gran Sport. Unlike the mid-size GS models, the Riviera and Wildcat GS package included a standard 3.42 positraction rear axle until 1973. The 1965 (and optional in 1966) Riviera Gran Sport also came with a 425 cubic \\"Super Wildcat\\" engine, with dual carbs and dual snorkel chrome air cleaner. You could add H2 option (Ride and handling package) for even better road handling. Shorter gear ratio for steering, 1 inch lower suspension. =Wildcat GS= 1966 Buick Wildcat GS convertible Another GS option package was available on the Buick Wildcat and Wildcat Custom, hardtop and convertible. The GS package included a 3.42 ratio posi rear, variable rate suspension springs, quick ratio steering box, heavy duty sway bars, and a switch-pitch Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission. The addition of the Y48 option gave the purchaser a pair of Carter AFB four barrel carburetors, and finned aluminum valve covers on the 425 nailhead engine. This was a one-year only option, existing in 1966 only. The Y48 option was delivered in the trunk and installed by the dealer. =Century GS / Century GS Stage 1= 1973 Buick Century GS 1973 Buick Century GS In 1973‚Äì75 and in 1986, there was a Century Gran Sport. For 1973, Buick renamed its intermediate line from Skylark to Century, a nameplate previously used on Buick's full-sized performance cars from 1936 to 1942 and 1954 to 1958. Like all GM intermediates, the 1973 Century received new Colonnade styling, which amounted to pillared hardtop sedans, coupes and station wagons - each of which utilized frameless windows along with fixed rear side windows, and convertibles were discontinued. on third generation Buick Century the GS name badge became the \\"Gran Sport\\" and was now an option package on the semi- fastback Century Colonnade coupes. The \\"Gran Sport\\" option included decals on the rear fenders and trunk lid reading \\"gran sport\\" along with suspension and appearance upgrades. The standard engine was a 150-horsepower 350 two-barrel V8, which was the standard engine for all Centurys. In addition to the 175-horsepower 350 four-barrel V8 (with single exhaust), the 190-horsepower 350 four-barrel V8 (with dual exhaust) was available only on the Gran Sport. Two 455 cubic-inch V8s were available including the 250-horsepower four-barrel and the Stage 1 four-barrel rated at 270 horsepower (both with dual exhaust) - all net figures and similar to the 1972 models. In 1973 only 979 Century Gran sport 455 and 728 Century Gran sport 455 Stage 1 models were assembled, For 350 engines there was 3 transmissions available, 3 speed manual or 4 speed M21 manual and Turbo Hydra-matic 350 Automatic and for 455 engines only M21 four speed manual and Automatic Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission. The 1974 Century \\"gran sport\\" received exterior and interior trim changes. The same selection of engines was carried over from 1973 including the 350 four-barrel, 455 four-barrel and the 455 Stage 1 four-barrel (the 455s downrated to 245 and 255 net horsepower respectively). In this Year 455 stage 1 was one of first GM cars that receive High energy ignition distributor. Like 1973 model year for 350 engines there was 3 speed manual or 4 speed M21 manual and Turbo Hydra- matic 350 Automatic and for 455 engines M21 four speed manual and Automatic Turbo Hydra-matic 400 transmission. Radial tires were a new option for 1974 along with reclining Strato bucket seats. In 1974 only 579 Century Gran sport 455 and 478 Century Gran sport 455 Stage 1 models were assembled. For 1975, the Century GS, or \\"gran sport\\" entered its third and final year on the Colonnade body. It was reduced to a mere appearance/handling package as the 455/Stage 1 options were discontinued and Buick's revived 231 cubic-inch V6 was the standard engine, mated to a standard three-speed manual transmission or optional Turbo Hydra-matic. The only optional engines were two 350 V8s, a two-barrel 155 horsepower version or the four-barrel option rated at 175 horsepower and offered only with the Turbo Hydra-matic. Both engines were also mated to catalytic converters for the first time this year, which mandated the use of unleaded gasoline and precluded the availability of true dual exhaust systems. Radial tires were now standard equipment and the Strato bucket seat option reverted to the non-reclining version. Both the Century GS and the larger Riviera GS (which also had been continually produced since 1965) were discontinued after the 1975 model year due to sagging sales for high- performance cars following the 1973‚Äì74 energy crisis and subsequent trends toward smaller and more fuel-efficient cars. Performance versions of the Century (and its companion Regal line) and Riviera would return in the late 1970s with the advent of Buick's turbocharged 231 V6 introduced in 1978 on the Century/Regal intermediates and the full-sized LeSabre Sport Coupe and then the newly introduced front drive Riviera in 1979 for the \\"S-Type\\" which later became the T-Type, a moniker that would ultimately replace the GS badge for sporty/performance Buicks in the early 1980s. The Century GS model returned in 1986 for what was now Buick's front-drive intermediate-sized car (Regal continued as a coupe on the 1978-vintage rear-drive G-body until 1987). The GS was only offered as a two-door coupe and was powered by a fuel-injected 3.8 liter (231 cubic-inch) V6 mated to a four-speed overdrive automatic transmission but with far less horsepower than the rear-drive Regal GN's turbocharged/intercooled version rated at 245 horsepower. This Century GS was a one-year-only offering in 1986 sold alongside the Century T-Type coupe and sedan. =Apollo GSX= In 1974, the GSX consisted of a trim package on Buick's small, X-bodied Apollo. Three engines were available on the 1974 GSX: the Chevrolet supplied 250 6-cyl.,and two Buick engines:the 350 2 barrel and 350 4 barrel versions. =Regal GS / Regal GSX= 1988 Buick Regal GS coupe 1990‚Äì1994 Buick Regal GS sedan 1997-2004 Buick Regal GSX sedan 2008-2017 Buick Regal GS sedan 2018-present Buick Regal GS sedan The 3800 Series II L67 Supercharged engine in a 1998 GS From 1988 to 2004 and 2010 to present There is Buick Regal GS and Gran Sport models. For third Generations Buick Regal there was a Gran Sport version model. The Gran Sport option generally contained the following items: * Leather bucket seats and center console * Black, wide, body side moldings (coupe only) * Gran Touring (FE3) suspension - which included faster power steering, and revised springs and struts * Front air dam and aero rocker panels (coupe only) * 16 inch aluminum wheels * Fog lamps * Two tone paint (sedan only) * Leather steering wheel Beginning in late 1990, the 3.8L (231 cu in) Series I V6 producing was available. The 1997‚Äì2004 body style featured a 3.8L Series II supercharged V6. For 4th Generation Buick Regal The 3.8 liter V6 supercharged Regal GS had a 1/4 mile ET of 14.9 seconds, and acceleration to 60 mph (97 km/h) took 6.7 seconds. The Regal GS, equipped with the supercharged 3.8 liter V6 engine (L67) produced and of torque. The Regal GS's PCM has programming that activates torque management to reduce wheel spin at launch. Regal GS was EPA rated at 18/27 MPG city/freeway. In the 2003 and 2004 model years, Buick, in collaboration with SLP Performance, came out with the Buick Regal GSX. They offered dealer-installed options and dealer supplied accessories for GS models. Like the GS Buicks that came before it, the SLP GSX came in three power train packages, referred to as stages. The Stage 1 package added 10 horsepower with the addition of a dual stainless steel cat-back exhaust system and free-flowing cold air induction system. For the Stage 2 package, a Hypertech Power Programmer with an SLP custom calibration tune was included with the Stage 1 components good for an extra 20 horsepower. The range-topping Stage 3 package added a 3.5 inch smaller diameter supercharger pulley to crank up the boost. With an advertised 30 more horsepower than stock, the Stage 3 GSX was conservatively rated at 270 horsepower and 312 pound-feet of torque. Since the parts were available from SLP over the counter for many years, there have been quite a few Regal GS sedans that have been cloned into a GSX for both appearance and performance purposes. Though the model didn‚Äôt officially debut until 2003, a licensed SLP dealer could perform the transformation on any Regal GS from 1997 to 2004. A true GSX can be verified from an SLP door jamb label with the correct part number for the kit. For the 5th generation Buick Regal, the GS version of the Regal was based on the Opel Insignia OPC and the Vauxhall Insignia VXR. This front-wheel drive sedan GS features Buick's Interactive Drive Control System with GS mode, a choice of an FGP Germany F40-6 six-speed manual or Aisin AF-40 (G2) six-speed automatic transmission, high performance brakes with Brembo front calipers and high performance strut (HiPerStrut) front suspension. 19 inch wheels will be standard and 20 inch forged aluminum wheels will be available. The GS is expected to accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in under seven seconds. It is equipped with GS-only high-output version of the Ecotec 2.0L turbo engine with and of torque. The GM LHU engine used in the GS trim makes 135 hp per liter. For the 6th generation Regal, from 2018 Buick released an updated version of the Regal GS. The new Regal is equipped with a GM LGX V6 3.6 producing 310 horsepower paired with a 9-speed automatic transmission yielding acceleration from zero to 60 mph in under six seconds.

It was connected to Canning Dock to the south and George's Basin to the north. History Construction of the dock began in 1762, and was known as North Dock prior to completion. The dock, which opened in 1771, was designed and built by Henry Berry and named after the reigning monarch, King George III. The dock basin originally covered an area of slightly more than . The Goree Warehouses were built to the east of the dock in 1793, and severely damaged during a fire in 1802 which caused over ¬£320,000 of damage. The dock was rebuilt and expanded between 1822‚Äì5, after losing its American and Caribbean shipping to Prince's Dock, being expanded by John Foster, Sr.. Following the rebuild and expansion, the dock was mainly used by schooners carrying perishable goods. The adjoining George's Basin was filled in 1874. In 1899-1900 the dock was filled in to create what is now the Pier Head, to provide one central place for Liverpool Docks' offices, which before were scattered across different sites. A section of the original George's Dock wall is still visible in the basement of the Cunard Building which stands on the site. The Goree Warehouses, which had been named after a slave market in West Africa, were destroyed by bombing during World War II. By March 2009, work was completed on a ¬£22 million extension of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal on the site of the former basin. The canal extension provides a further 1.4 miles of navigable waterway.

Mittal Steel was based in Rotterdam but managed from London by Mittal and his son Aditya. It was formed when Ispat International N.V. acquired LNM Holdings N.V. (both were already controlled by Lakshmi Mittal) and merged with International Steel Group in 2004. On 25 June 2006, Mittal Steel decided to take over Arcelor, with the new company to be called ArcelorMittal. The takeover has been successfully approved by shareholders and directors of Arcelor making L.N. Mittal the largest steel maker in the world. History It was formed as Ispat International in 1978, at the time it was part of the Indian Steel making company Ispat Industries which was founded by Lakshmi Mittal's father and was owned by his family, but in 1995 it separated from that company after various disagreements between Lakshmi and his father. In 1989, the company acquired Iron & Steel Company of Trinidad & Tobago. In 1992, the company acquired Sibalsa. In 1994, the company acquired Sidbec-Dosco. In 1995, the company acquired Hamburger Stahlwerke, which formed Ispat International Ltd. and Ispat Shipping, and also bought Karmet Steel of Temirtau, Kazakhstan. In 1997, the company acquired Walzdraht Hochfeld GmbH and Stahlwerk Ruhrort. In 1997, the company went public as Ispat International NV. In 1998, the company acquired Inland Steel Company. In 1999, the company acquired Unim√©tal. In 2001, the company acquired ALFASID and Sidex. In 2002, it bought a majority stake in Iscor. In 2003, the company acquired Nowa Huta. In 2004, the company acquired Polskie Huty Stali, BH Steel, and certain Macedonian facilities from Balkan Steel. In 2005, the company hired Deloitte as the primary auditors for the company. In 2005, the company acquired International Steel Group. In 2005, the company acquired Kryvorizhstal. In 2005, the company announced the investment of $9 billion in Jharkhand, India. In 2006, the company merged with Arcelor after much controversy. In 2006, the company announced investment for a 12 million tonne capacity steel plant in Odisha, India.  Bids and acquisitions  In October 2005 Mittal Steel acquired Ukrainian steel manufacturer Kryvorizhstal for $4.8 billion in an auction after a controversial earlier sale for a much lower price to a consortium including the son-in-law of ex-President Leonid Kuchma was cancelled by the incoming government of President Viktor Yushchenko. In 2005 Lakshmi Mittal flew into Jharkhand, India to announce a $9 billion investment to build a greenfield steel plant with a 12 million tonnes per annum production capacity. On 27 January 2006 it announced a $23.3 billion (‚Ç¨18.6 billion, ¬£12.7 billion) bid for Arcelor. On 19 May 2006 Mittal increased its offer for Arcelor by 38.7% to $32.4bn, or $47.34 per share (‚Ç¨25.8bn, ‚Ç¨37.74 per share). On 25 June 2006 Arcelor, in a board meeting announced that it has accepted a further sweetened offer ($50.68 or ‚Ç¨40.4 per share) and the new company would now be called ArcelorMittal, thus successfully ending one of the most controversial and publicised takeover bids in modern corporate history. ArcelorMittal is now by far the largest steelmaker in the world by turnover as well as volume, controlling 10% of the total world steel output.

The dock was built on the River Mersey in Liverpool, England, starting in 1710 and completed in 1716. A natural tidal pool off the river Mersey, which probably gave its name to Liverpool centuries earlier, was partially filled and locked in from the river with quay walls erected. History The Old Dock was built at a cost of ¬£11,000 and opened on 31 August 1715. Thomas Steers was the engineer responsible; and additional advice was obtained from George Sorocold. Originally a tidal basin was accessed directly from the river, and from 1737 access was via Canning Dock. The dock was built with one graving dock; a second and third graving dock where added in 1746 and the 1750s. The dock walls were constructed from brick laid directly on to sandstone bedrock. The dock gates would have allowed as much as 10% of the water out between high tides, resulting in a water level drop of several feet. This may have been offset by water entering the dock from a stream. It accommodated up to 100 ships. Although Liverpool vessels were involved in the slave trade before the dock opened, it would have served ships involved in the Africa-America trade, propelling Liverpool to world leader of this trade. The dock led to Liverpool's establishment as the leading European port and subsequent world trading port. Redevelopment Viewing window to the Old Dock In the early 19th century, the dock was considered too small for the growing size of shipping using the port; the quays were too narrow; the city's sewage polluted the dock's water; and the narrow wooden drawbridge across its entrance channel caused traffic jams. Sentiment saved the Old Dock for 20 years, but the Old Dock closed on 31 August 1826 and was filled in. Liverpool‚Äôs fourth Custom House, designed by John Foster, was built on the site between 1828 and 1837, and was demolished after severe bomb damage during the Battle of Britain (World War II). In 1999 an office block on the site, Steers House, was demolished, and the resulting waste ground was used as an NCP car park until 2004, when the site was incorporated into the Paradise Project. A water feature has been built on the site of Old Dock to commemorate its history. A portion of the dock wall is exposed in the basement of the new development, and can be viewed from the pavement above through a viewing window in the ground. The excavated site was opened to the public in May 2010. Tours of the Old Dock are currently operated by National Museums Liverpool on a weekly basis. Media The excavation of the dock featured in a Time Team Special episode, first broadcast on Channel 4 on Monday 21 April 2008.

Although of considerable local importance, the organisation remained much smaller and less influential at a national level than the National Sailors' and Firemen's Union, (NSFU). The BSU was formed in Southampton on 6 October 1911, as a breakaway from the NSFU. In August 1912, a second breakaway took place in Glasgow, and a branch of the BSU was established in that port. The cause of the split was ostensibly the same in both ports: the rebels claimed that the NSFU was reckless and extravagant with its funds, that members had little control over the direction of the organisation, and that its leading officials were unaccountable. The NSFU itself vigorously denied these allegations. It accused the BSU of sectionalism, and of being the product of the political ambitions of its leading officials, Tommy Lewis and Manny Shinwell. In June 1912, the BSU took part in the national dock strike of 1912. The NSFU, although affiliated to the body which had called the strike, the National Transport Workers' Federation, refused to support the strike except in London. Unlike the NSFU, the BSU was not granted a role on the National Maritime Board which was formed in 1917 to decide on working practices in the merchant shipping industry. In May 1921, the Board imposed wage reductions which were resisted by both the BSU and the National Union of Ship's Stewards. Later that year, these two organisations were merged to form the Amalgamated Marine Workers' Union, (AMWU).

Computable functions are the formalized analogue of the intuitive notion of algorithms, in the sense that a function is computable if there exists an algorithm that can do the job of the function, i.e. given an input of the function domain it can return the corresponding output. Computable functions are used to discuss computability without referring to any concrete model of computation such as Turing machines or register machines. Any definition, however, must make reference to some specific model of computation but all valid definitions yield the same class of functions. Particular models of computability that give rise to the set of computable functions are the Turing-computable functions and the Œº-recursive functions. Before the precise definition of computable function, mathematicians often used the informal term effectively calculable. This term has since come to be identified with the computable functions. Note that the effective computability of these functions does not imply that they can be efficiently computed (i.e. computed within a reasonable amount of time). In fact, for some effectively calculable functions it can be shown that any algorithm that computes them will be very inefficient in the sense that the running time of the algorithm increases exponentially (or even superexponentially) with the length of the input. The fields of feasible computability and computational complexity study functions that can be computed efficiently. According to the Church‚ÄìTuring thesis, computable functions are exactly the functions that can be calculated using a mechanical calculation device given unlimited amounts of time and storage space. Equivalently, this thesis states that a function is computable if and only if it has an algorithm. Note that an algorithm in this sense is understood to be a sequence of steps a person with unlimited time and an unlimited supply of pen and paper could follow. The Blum axioms can be used to define an abstract computational complexity theory on the set of computable functions. In computational complexity theory, the problem of determining the complexity of a computable function is known as a function problem. Definition Computability of a function is an informal notion. One way to describe it is to say that a function is computable if its value can be obtained by an effective procedure. With more rigor, a function f:\\\\mathbb N^k\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbb N is computable if and only if there is an effective procedure that, given any -tuple \\\\mathbf x of natural numbers, will produce the value f(\\\\mathbf x). In agreement with this definition, the remainder of this article presumes that computable functions take finitely many natural numbers as arguments and produce a value which is a single natural number. As counterparts to this informal description, there exist multiple formal, mathematical definitions. The class of computable functions can be defined in many equivalent models of computation, including * Turing machines * Œº-recursive functions * Lambda calculus * Post machines (Post‚ÄìTuring machines and tag machines). * Register machines Although these models use different representations for the functions, their inputs and their outputs, translations exist between any two models, and so every model describes essentially the same class of functions, giving rise to the opinion that formal computability is both natural and not too narrow. For example, one can formalize computable functions as Œº-recursive functions, which are partial functions that take finite tuples of natural numbers and return a single natural number (just as above). They are the smallest class of partial functions that includes the constant, successor, and projection functions, and is closed under composition, primitive recursion, and the Œº operator. Equivalently, computable functions can be formalized as functions which can be calculated by an idealized computing agent such as a Turing machine or a register machine. Formally speaking, a partial function f:\\\\mathbb N^k\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbb N can be calculated if and only if there exists a computer program with the following properties: # If f(\\\\mathbf x) is defined, then the program will terminate on the input \\\\mathbf x with the value f(\\\\mathbf x) stored in the computer memory. # If f(\\\\mathbf x) is undefined, then the program never terminates on the input \\\\mathbf x.  Characteristics of computable functions  The basic characteristic of a computable function is that there must be a finite procedure (an algorithm) telling how to compute the function. The models of computation listed above give different interpretations of what a procedure is and how it is used, but these interpretations share many properties. The fact that these models give equivalent classes of computable functions stems from the fact that each model is capable of reading and mimicking a procedure for any of the other models, much as a compiler is able to read instructions in one computer language and emit instructions in another language. Enderton [1977] gives the following characteristics of a procedure for computing a computable function; similar characterizations have been given by Turing [1936], Rogers [1967], and others. * \\"There must be exact instructions (i.e. a program), finite in length, for the procedure.\\" Thus every computable function must have a finite program that completely describes how the function is to be computed. It is possible to compute the function by just following the instructions; no guessing or special insight is required. * \\"If the procedure is given a k-tuple x in the domain of f, then after a finite number of discrete steps the procedure must terminate and produce f(x).\\" Intuitively, the procedure proceeds step by step, with a specific rule to cover what to do at each step of the calculation. Only finitely many steps can be carried out before the value of the function is returned. * \\"If the procedure is given a k-tuple x which is not in the domain of f, then the procedure might go on forever, never halting. Or it might get stuck at some point (i.e., one of its instructions cannot be executed), but it must not pretend to produce a value for f at x.\\" Thus if a value for f(x) is ever found, it must be the correct value. It is not necessary for the computing agent to distinguish correct outcomes from incorrect ones because the procedure is defined as correct if and only if it produces an outcome. Enderton goes on to list several clarifications of these 3 requirements of the procedure for a computable function: # The procedure must theoretically work for arbitrarily large arguments. It is not assumed that the arguments are smaller than the number of atoms in the Earth, for example. # The procedure is required to halt after finitely many steps in order to produce an output, but it may take arbitrarily many steps before halting. No time limitation is assumed. # Although the procedure may use only a finite amount of storage space during a successful computation, there is no bound on the amount of space that is used. It is assumed that additional storage space can be given to the procedure whenever the procedure asks for it. To summarise, based on this view a function is computable if: (a) given an input from its domain, possibly relying on unbounded storage space, it can give the corresponding output by following a procedure (program, algorithm) that is formed by a finite number of exact unambiguous instructions; (b) it returns such output (halts) in a finite number of steps; and (c) if given an input which is not in its domain it either never halts or it gets stuck. The field of computational complexity studies functions with prescribed bounds on the time and/or space allowed in a successful computation.  Computable sets and relations  A set of natural numbers is called computable (synonyms: recursive, decidable) if there is a computable, total function such that for any natural number , if is in and if is not in . A set of natural numbers is called computably enumerable (synonyms: recursively enumerable, semidecidable) if there is a computable function such that for each number , is defined if and only if is in the set. Thus a set is computably enumerable if and only if it is the domain of some computable function. The word enumerable is used because the following are equivalent for a nonempty subset of the natural numbers: * is the domain of a computable function. * is the range of a total computable function. If is infinite then the function can be assumed to be injective. If a set is the range of a function then the function can be viewed as an enumeration of , because the list will include every element of . Because each finitary relation on the natural numbers can be identified with a corresponding set of finite sequences of natural numbers, the notions of computable relation and computably enumerable relation can be defined from their analogues for sets.  Formal languages  '' In computability theory in computer science, it is common to consider formal languages. An alphabet is an arbitrary set. A word on an alphabet is a finite sequence of symbols from the alphabet; the same symbol may be used more than once. For example, binary strings are exactly the words on the alphabet . A language is a subset of the collection of all words on a fixed alphabet. For example, the collection of all binary strings that contain exactly 3 ones is a language over the binary alphabet. A key property of a formal language is the level of difficulty required to decide whether a given word is in the language. Some coding system must be developed to allow a computable function to take an arbitrary word in the language as input; this is usually considered routine. A language is called computable (synonyms: recursive, decidable) if there is a computable function such that for each word over the alphabet, if the word is in the language and if the word is not in the language. Thus a language is computable just in case there is a procedure that is able to correctly tell whether arbitrary words are in the language. A language is computably enumerable (synonyms: recursively enumerable, semidecidable) if there is a computable function such that is defined if and only if the word is in the language. The term enumerable has the same etymology as in computably enumerable sets of natural numbers. Examples The following functions are computable: * Each function with a finite domain; e.g., any finite sequence of natural numbers. * Each constant function f : Nk ‚Üí N, f(n1,...nk) := n. * Addition f : N2 ‚Üí N, f(n1,n2) := n1 \\\\+ n2 * The greatest common divisor of two numbers * A B√©zout coefficient of two numbers * The smallest prime factor of a number If f and g are computable, then so are: f + g, f * g, f \\\\circ g if f is unary, max(f,g), min(f,g), arg max{y ‚â§ f(x)} and many more combinations. The following examples illustrate that a function may be computable though it is not known which algorithm computes it. * The function f such that f(n) = 1 if there is a sequence of at least n consecutive fives in the decimal expansion of œÄ, and f(n) = 0 otherwise, is computable. (The function f is either the constant 1 function, which is computable, or else there is a k such that f(n) = 1 if n < k and f(n) = 0 if n ‚â• k. Every such function is computable. It is not known whether there are arbitrarily long runs of fives in the decimal expansion of œÄ, so we don't know which of those functions is f. Nevertheless, we know that the function f must be computable.) * Each finite segment of an uncomputable sequence of natural numbers (such as the Busy Beaver function Œ£) is computable. E.g., for each natural number n, there exists an algorithm that computes the finite sequence Œ£(0), Œ£(1), Œ£(2), ..., Œ£(n) ‚Äî in contrast to the fact that there is no algorithm that computes the entire Œ£-sequence, i.e. Œ£(n) for all n. Thus, \\"Print 0, 1, 4, 6, 13\\" is a trivial algorithm to compute Œ£(0), Œ£(1), Œ£(2), Œ£(3), Œ£(4); similarly, for any given value of n, such a trivial algorithm exists (even though it may never be known or produced by anyone) to compute Œ£(0), Œ£(1), Œ£(2), ..., Œ£(n).  Church‚ÄìTuring thesis  The Church‚ÄìTuring thesis states that any function computable from a procedure possessing the three properties listed above is a computable function. Because these three properties are not formally stated, the Church‚ÄìTuring thesis cannot be proved. The following facts are often taken as evidence for the thesis: * Many equivalent models of computation are known, and they all give the same definition of computable function (or a weaker version, in some instances). * No stronger model of computation which is generally considered to be effectively calculable has been proposed. The Church‚ÄìTuring thesis is sometimes used in proofs to justify that a particular function is computable by giving a concrete description of a procedure for the computation. This is permitted because it is believed that all such uses of the thesis can be removed by the tedious process of writing a formal procedure for the function in some model of computation.  Provability  Given a function (or, similarly, a set), one may be interested not only if it is computable, but also whether this can be proven in a particular proof system (usually first order Peano arithmetic). A function that can be proven to be computable is called provably total. The set of provably total functions is recursively enumerable: one can enumerate all the provably total functions by enumerating all their corresponding proofs, that prove their computability. This can be done by enumerating all the proofs of the proof system and ignoring irrelevant ones. = Relation to recursively defined functions = In a function defined by a recursive definition, each value is defined by a fixed first-order formula of other, previously defined values of the same function or other functions, which might be simply constants. A subset of these is the primitive recursive functions. Every such function is provably total: For such a k-ary function f, each value f(n_1, n_2... n_k) can be computed by following the definition backwards, iteratively, and after finite number of iteration (as can be easily proven), a constant is reached. The converse is not true, as not every provably total function is primitive recursive. Indeed, one can enumerate all the primitive recursive functions and define a function en such that for all n, m: en(n,m) = fn(m), where fn is the n-th primitive recursive function (for k-ary functions, this will be set to fn(m,m...m)). Now, g(n) = en(n,n)+1 is provably total but not primitive recursive, by a diagonalization argument: had there been a j such that g = fj, we would have got g(j) = en(j,j)+1 = fj (j)+1= g(j)+1, a contradiction. (The G√∂del numbers of all primitive recursive functions can be enumerated by a primitive recursive function, though the primitive recursive functions' values cannot.) One such function, which is provable total but not primitive recursive, is the Ackermann function: since it is recursively defined, it is indeed easy to prove its computability (However, a similar diagonalization argument can also be built for all functions defined by recursive definition; thus, there are provable total functions that cannot be defined recursively ). = Total functions that are not provably total = In a sound proof system, every provably total function is indeed total, but the converse is not true: in every first-order proof system that is strong enough and sound (including Peano arithmetic), one can prove (in another proof system) the existence of total functions that cannot be proven total in the proof system. If the total computable functions are enumerated via the Turing machines that produces them, then the above statement can be shown, if the proof system is sound, by a similar diagonalization argument to that used above, using the enumeration of provably total functions given earlier. One uses a Turing machine that enumerates the relevant proofs, and for every input n calls fn(n) (where fn is n-th function by this enumeration) by invoking the Turing machine that computes it according to the n-th proof. Such a Turing machine is guaranteed to halt if the proof system is sound.  Uncomputable functions and unsolvable problems  Every computable function has a finite procedure giving explicit, unambiguous instructions on how to compute it. Furthermore, this procedure has to be encoded in the finite alphabet used by the computational model, so there are only countably many computable functions. For example, functions may be encoded using a string of bits (the alphabet }). The real numbers are uncountable so most real numbers are not computable. See computable number. The set of finitary functions on the natural numbers is uncountable so most are not computable. Concrete examples of such functions are Busy beaver, Kolmogorov complexity, or any function that outputs the digits of a noncomputable number, such as Chaitin's constant. Similarly, most subsets of the natural numbers are not computable. The halting problem was the first such set to be constructed. The Entscheidungsproblem, proposed by David Hilbert, asked whether there is an effective procedure to determine which mathematical statements (coded as natural numbers) are true. Turing and Church independently showed in the 1930s that this set of natural numbers is not computable. According to the Church‚ÄìTuring thesis, there is no effective procedure (with an algorithm) which can perform these computations. Extensions of computability =Relative computability= The notion of computability of a function can be relativized to an arbitrary set of natural numbers A. A function f is defined to be computable in A (equivalently A-computable or computable relative to A) when it satisfies the definition of a computable function with modifications allowing access to A as an oracle. As with the concept of a computable function relative computability can be given equivalent definitions in many different models of computation. This is commonly accomplished by supplementing the model of computation with an additional primitive operation which asks whether a given integer is a member of A. We can also talk about f being computable in g by identifying g with its graph. =Higher recursion theory= Hyperarithmetical theory studies those sets that can be computed from a computable ordinal number of iterates of the Turing jump of the empty set. This is equivalent to sets defined by both a universal and existential formula in the language of second order arithmetic and to some models of Hypercomputation. Even more general recursion theories have been studied, such as E-recursion theory in which any set can be used as an argument to an E-recursive function. =Hyper-computation= Although the Church‚ÄìTuring thesis states that the computable functions include all functions with algorithms, it is possible to consider broader classes of functions that relax the requirements that algorithms must possess. The field of Hypercomputation studies models of computation that go beyond normal Turing computation.

It is served by London Underground (LU) and National Rail trains on independent platforms. It is the western terminus of the Central line's West Ruislip branch; Ruislip Gardens is the next Underground station towards central London. The Central line and Chiltern Railways platforms and ticket office hall are managed by LU. The closest station on the Metropolitan and Piccadilly lines is Ickenham, from West Ruislip Station. History A 1914 Railway Clearing House map of railways in the vicinity of West Ruislip (shown here as Ruislip & Ickenham) The station was opened on 2 April 1906 as Ruislip & Ickenham by the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway (GW&GCJR;). The GW&GCJR; connected London and the Midlands via High Wycombe and provided an alternative route to the Great Central Railway's (GCR's) main line through Aylesbury, Harrow and Wembley which shared its route with the Metropolitan Railway. Prior to the Second World War plans had been made for a number of extensions to the Central line. The London Passenger Transport Board's (LPTB's) 1935-40 New Works programme included the extension of the Central line to run alongside the Great Western Railway (GWR) tracks from North Acton to South Ruislip and the GW&GCJR; tracks from there as far as Denham; the post-war introduction of the Metropolitan Green Belt caused the extension to be cut back to West Ruislip. Had the Central line extension been completed as planned, the next station would have been Harefield Road. Preparatory work on this section had started just before the war and a section of trackbed constructed for the extension can be seen to the west of the road overbridge, beyond the buffer stops of the Central line tracks alongside the National Rail line. The additional tracks were constructed by the GWR on behalf of the LPTB and on 30 June 1947, the first section of the western extension opened from North Acton to Greenford. On the same date the station name was changed to West Ruislip (for Ickenham). Central line services began running from West Ruislip on 21 November 1948. The station building was built by British Railways for London Underground and was not completed until the 1960s and at about the same time the sub-title was omitted from the station name. Some Central line stations with older signage still show the longer name on the line diagrams on their platforms. The station was transferred from the Western Region of British Rail to the London Midland Region on 24 March 1974. The London Borough of Hillingdon announced in June 2011 that it would be lobbying Transport for London to have the Central line extended from West Ruislip to Uxbridge. Such a project would require a business case approved by TfL and the completion of signal upgrade work on the Metropolitan line. Services = National Rail - Chiltern Railways = The Monday - Friday off-peak service consists of: *1 train per hour to *1 train per hour to A parliamentary train used to run once a day on weekdays from London Paddington to West Ruislip. The train now terminates at High Wycombe, passing West Ruislip without stopping. = London Underground - Central Line = The peak time (06:30-09:30 & 16:00-19:00 Mon to Fri) service currently consists of: * 7tph to Epping * 5tph to Debden The off-peak service currently consists of: * 9tph to Epping Present day West Ruislip station is aligned approximately east-west with the main station buildings on the road overbridge across the lines at the western end of the station. The station has four platforms; two each for London Underground and National Rail services. The London Underground tracks are south of the National Rail ones and operate from an island platform whilst the National Rail platforms are outside of their tracks. The National Rail platforms are also served by a separate station building north of the tracks and adjacent to the car park. In a legacy of the original scheme to continue the extension to Denham, the Central line tracks continue for a short distance beyond the station before ending at buffers. The intended alignment of the unbuilt tracks can be seen from the width of the unused railway land south of the existing tracks. The Central line's Ruislip depot is east of West Ruislip station, and has a connection via a shunting neck to the Network Rail westbound track west of the station to allow rolling stock and material deliveries. The depot also has a connection to the Uxbridge branch tracks of the Metropolitan and Piccadilly Lines which pass under the Central line east of West Ruislip; it is used only for empty stock movements and works train access. Two sidings west of the station to the north of the running lines provide layover facilities for works trains. There are ticket barriers at the main entrance to the station, controlling access to the Central line platforms from the public highway and the pedestrian walkway linking the car park to the station. The Chiltern platforms can be reached from the car park walkway without tickets. Connections London Buses routes 278, U1 and U10 serve the station.

The titanosaurians were the last surviving group of long-necked sauropods, with taxa still thriving at the time of the extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous. This group includes some of the largest land animals known to have ever existed, such as Patagotitan‚Äîestimated at long with a weight of ‚Äîand the comparably-sized Argentinosaurus and Puertasaurus from the same region. The group's name alludes to the mythological Titans of ancient Greek mythology, via the type genus (now considered a nomen dubium) Titanosaurus. Together with the brachiosaurids and relatives, titanosaurians make up the larger sauropod clade Titanosauriformes. Titanosaurs have long been a poorly-known group, and the relationships between titanosaur species are still not well-understood. Description Xinghesaurus\\" Titanosaurs had small heads, even when compared with other sauropods. The head was also wide, similar to the heads of Camarasaurus and Brachiosaurus, though somewhat more elongated. Titanosaurian nostrils were large (\\"macronarian\\") and all had crests formed by the nasal bones. Their teeth were either somewhat spatulate (spoon-like) or like pegs or pencils, but were always very small. Titanosaur necks were of average length for sauropods, and their tails were whip-like though not as long as in the diplodocids. While the pelvis was slimmer than some sauropods, the pectoral (chest) area was much wider, giving them a uniquely \\"wide-legged\\" stance. As a result, the fossilized trackways of titanosaurians are distinctly broader than other sauropods. Their forelimbs were also stocky, and often longer than their hind limbs. Unlike other sauropods, some titanosaurs had no digits, walking only on horseshoe-shaped \\"stumps\\" made up of the columnar metacarpal bones.Apestegu√≠a, S. (2005). \\"Evolution of the titanosaur metacarpus\\". Pp. 321‚Äì345 in Tidwell, V. and Carpenter, K. (eds.) Thunder-Lizards: The Sauropodomorph Dinosaurs. Indianapolis: Indiana University Press. Their vertebrae (back bones) were solid (not hollowed-out), which may be a reversal to more basal saurischian characteristics. Their spinal column was relatively flexible, likely making them more agile than other sauropods and more able to rear onto their hind legs. One of the most characteristic features shared by most titanosaurs were their procoelous caudal vertebrae, with ball-and-socket articulations between the vertebral centra. From skin impressions found with fossils, it has been determined that the skin of many titanosaurians was armored with a small mosaic of small, bead-like scales surrounding larger scales. While most titanosaurs were very large animals, many were fairly average in size compared to other giant dinosaurs. Some island-dwelling dwarf titanosaurs, such as Magyarosaurus, were probably the result of allopatric speciation and insular dwarfism. =Body size= Titanosauria have the largest range of body size of any sauropod clade, and includes both the largest known sauropods and some of the smallest. One of the largest titanosaurs, Patagotitan, had a body mass estimated to be , whereas one of the smallest, Magyarosaurus, had a body mass of approximately . Even relatively closely related titanosaurs could be very different body sizes, as the small rinconsaurs were closely related to the gigantic lognkosaurs. The smallest titanosaurs, such as Magyarosaurus, inhabited Europe, which was largely made up of islands during the Cretaceous, and were likely island dwarfs. =Skull= The heads of titanosaurians are poorly known. However, several different cranial morphologies are apparent. In some species, such as Sarmientosaurus, the head resembled that of brachiosaurids. In others, such as Rapetosaurus and Nemegtosaurus, the head resembled that of diplodocids. In some titanosaurs, the skull was especially diplodocid-like due to square- shaped jaws; the titanosaur Antarctosaurus is especially similar to the rebbachisaurid Nigersaurus. =Vertebrae= The dorsal vertebrae of titanosaurs show multiple derived features among sauropods. Similarly to the Rebbachisauridae, titanosaurs lost the , a set of surfaces between vertebrae that prevent additional rotation of the bones. Andesaurus, one of the most basal titanosaurs, shows a normal hyposphene. The same area is reduced in Argentinosaurus to only two ridges, and is fully absent in taxa like Opisthocoelicaudia and Saltasaurus. Both Argentinosaurus and Epachthosaurus bear similar intermediate \\"hyposphenal ridges,\\" which suggests they represent a more primitive form of dorsal vertebrae. =Limbs= Manus of Diamantinasaurus, the only titanosaur known to have multiple phalanges Sauropod hands already are highly derived from other dinosaurs, being reduced into columnar metacarpals and blocky phalanges with fewer claws. However, titanosaurs evolved the manus even further, completely losing the phalanges and heavily modifying the metacarpals. Argyrosaurus is the only titanosaur known to possess carpals. Other taxa like Epachthosaurus show a reduction of phalanges to one or two bones. Opisthoeoclicaudia shows even more reduction of the hand than other titanosaurs, with both carpals and phalanges completely absent. However, Diamantinasaurus, while lacking carpals, preserves a manual formula of , including a thumb claw and phalanges on all other digits. This, coupled with the preservation of a single phalanx on digit IV of Epachthosaurus and potentially Opisthocoelicaudia (further study is necessary), show that preservation biases may be responsible for the lack of hand phalanges in these taxa. This suggests that Alamosaurus, Neuquensaurus, Saltasaurus and Rapetosaurus - all known from imperfect or disarticulated remains previously associated with a lack of phalanges - may have had phalanges but lost them after death. Titanosaurs have a poor fossil record of their pedes (feet), only being complete in five definitive titanosaurians. Among these, Notocolossus is the largest, and also has the most specialized pes: like all titanosaurs, its pes is composed of short, thick metatarsals of approximately the same lengths; however, metatarsals I and V are notably more robust than in other taxa. =Osteoderms= Ampelosaurus, a titanosaur with osteoderms, depicted with the osteoderms arranged in a pair of rows Some titanosaurs had osteoderms. Osteoderms were first confirmed in the genus Saltasaurus but are now known to have been present in a variety of titanosaurs within the clade Lithostrotia. The exact arrangement of osteoderms on the body of a titanosaur is not known, but some paleontologists consider it likely that the osteoderms were arranged in two parallel rows on the animal's back, an arrangement similar to the plates of stegosaurs. Several other arrangements have been proposed, such as a single row along the midline, and it is possible that different species had different arrangements. The osteoderms were certainly far more sparse than those of ankylosaurs, and did not completely cover the back in scutes. Because of their sparse arrangement, it was unlikely that they served a significant role in defense. However, they may have played an important role in nutrient storage for titanosaurs living in highly seasonal climates and for female titanosaurs laying eggs. Osteoderms were present on both large and small species, so they were not solely used by smaller species as protection against predators. Classification Titanosaurs are classified as sauropod dinosaurs. They are a highly diverse group form the dominant clade of Cretaceous sauropods. Within Sauropoda, titanosaurs were once classified as close relatives of Diplodocidae due to their shared characteristic of narrow teeth, but this is now known to be the result of convergent evolution. Titanosaurs are now known to be most closely related to euhelopodids and brachiosaurids; together they form a clade named Titanosauriformes. For much of the 20th century, most known species of titanosaurs were classified in the family Titanosauridae, which is no longer in widespread use. Titanosauria was first proposed in 1993 as a taxon to encompass titanosaurids and their close relatives. It has been phylogenetically defined as the clade composed of the most recent common ancestor of Saltasaurus and Andesaurus and all of its descendants. The relationships of species within Titanosauria remain largely unresolved, and it is considered one of the most poorly-understood areas of dinosaur classification. One of the few areas of agreement is that the majority of titanosaurs except Andesaurus and some other basal species form a clade called Lithostrotia, which some researchers consider equivalent to the deprecated Titanosauridae. Lithostrotians include titanosaurs such as Alamosaurus, Isisaurus, Malawisaurus, Rapetosaurus, and Saltasaurus. =Early history= Lectotype of Titanosaurus indicus, the name-bearing genus of Titanosauria Titanosaurus indicus was first named by British paleontologist Richard Lydekker in 1877, as a new taxon of dinosaur based on two caudals and a femur collected on different occasions at the same location in India. While it was later given a position as a sauropod within Cetiosauridae by Lydekker in 1888, he named the new sauropod family Titanosauridae for the genus in 1893, which included only Titanosaurus and Argyrosaurus, united by caudals, presacrals, a lack of pleurocoels and open chevrons. Following this, Austro-Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa reviewed reptile genera in 1928, and provided a short classification of Sauropoda, where he placed the Titanosaurinae (a reranking of Lydekker's Titanosauridae) in Morosauridae, and included the genera Titanosaurus, Hypselosaurus and Macrurosaurus because they all had strongly procoelous caudals. German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene provided a significant revision of Titanosauridae the following year in 1929, where he reviewed the dinosaurs of Cretaceous Argentina, and named multiple new genera. Huene included multiple species of Titanosaurus from India, England, France, Romania, Madagascar and Argentina, Hypselosaurus and Aepisaurus from France, Macrurosaurus from England, Alamosaurus from United States, and Argyrosaurus, Antarctosaurus, and Laplatasaurus from Argentina. The material between them represented almost all regions of the skeleton, which showed they were derived sauropods Huene interpreted as closest to Pleurocoelus of the various non-titanosaurid genera. Skeletal mount of Neuquensaurus australis For his 1986 thesis, Argentinian paleontologist Jaime Powell described and classified many new genera of South American titanosaurs. Using the family Titanosauridae to include them all, he grouped the genera into Titanosaurinae, Saltasaurinae, Antarctosaurinae, Argyrosaurinae and Titanosauridae indet. Titanosaurinae included Titanosaurus and the new genus Aeolosaurus, united by multiple features of the caudal vertebrae; the new clade Saltasaurinae was created to include Saltasaurus and the new genus Neuquensaurus, united by very distinct dorsals, caudals, and ilia; the new clade Antarctosaurinae was created to include Antarctosaurus, distinguished by large size, a different form of braincase, more elongate girdle bones, and more robust limb bones; and Argyrosaurinae was created for Argyrosaurus, bearing a more robust forelimb and hand and more primitive dorsals. The new genus Epachthosaurus was named for a more basal titanosaurid classified as Titanosauridae indet. along with unnamed specimens, Clasmodosaurus and Campylodoniscus. John Stanton McIntosh provided a synopsis of sauropod relationships in 1990, using Titanosauridae as the group to contain all taxa like previous authors. Opisthocoelicaudia was placed in Opisthocoelicaudiinae within Camarasauridae, following its original description and not later works, and Nemegtosaurus and Quaesitosaurus were placed within Dicraeosaurinae. Titanosauridae included many previously named genera, plus taxa like Tornieria and Janenschia. Saltasaurus included the species previously known as Titanosaurus australis and T. robustus, which were named Neuquensaurus by Powell in 1986. McIntosh provided a large diagnosis of the family: \\"dorsals with irregularly shaped pleurocoels and spines directed strongly backward; transverse processes directed dorsally as well as laterally, very robust in shoulder region; a second dorsosacral, its rib fused to ilium; caudals strongly procoelous with a prominent ball on distal end of centrum throughout tail; caudal arches on front half of centrum; sternal plates large; preacetabular process of ilium swept outward to become almost horizontal,\\" but stressed that the relationships of titanosaurids to other sauropod groups couldn't be determined due to a lack of cranial material. A brief review of putative titanosaurids from Europe was authored by Jean Le Loeuff in 1993, and covered the supposed genera known so far. The Barremian (middle Early Cretaceous) species Titanosaurus valdensis, named decades previous by Huene, was kept as the oldest of the titanosaurid and given the new genus name Iuticosaurus. The French taxon Aepisaurus was removed from the family and placed in undetermined Sauropoda. Macrurosaurus was considered a chimaera of titanosaurid and non-titanosaurid material because of the presence of both procoelous and caudals. Huene's species Titanosaurus lydekkeri was left as a nomen dubium, but left within Titanosauridae. Maastrichtian fossils from France and Spain were removed from Hypselosaurus and Titanosaurus, with Hypselosaurus being declared dubious like T. lydekkeri. The variety of Romanian fossils named as Magyarosaurus by Huene were also moved into the same species again, M. dacus as originally named by Nopcsa. =Titanosauria named= Argentinosaurus dorsal and sauropod paleontologist Matt Wedel Jos√© Bonaparte and Rodolfo Coria in 1993 concluded that a new clade of derived sauropods was necessary because Argentinosaurus, Andesaurus and Epachthosaurus were distinct from Titanosauridae as they possessed , but were still very closely related to the titanosaurids. The taxa that possessed the articulations were united within the new family Andesauridae, and the two families were grouped together within the new clade Titanosauria. The titanosaurs were diagnosed by possessing small centered within an anteroposteriorly elongate depression and the presence of two well defined depressions on the posterior face of the neural arch. The entire group was compared favourably with cetiosaurids like Patagosaurus and Volkheimeria. Overlooking the naming of Titanosauria, Paul Upchurch in 1995 named the clade Titanosauroidea, to include Opisthocoelicaudia and the more derived Titanosauridae (Malawisaurus, Alamosaurus and Saltasaurus). United by: caudals with anteriorly-shifted neural spines, extremely robust forearm bones, a prominent concavity on the ulna for articulation with the humerus, a laterally flared and flattened ilium, and a less robust pubis; Upchurch considered the clade sister taxon to Diplodocoidea, because of their shared dental anatomy, although he noted that peg-like teeth might have been independently evolved. This was followed up by Upchurch's 1998 study on sauropod phylogenetics, which additionally recovered Phuwiangosaurus and Andesaurus within Titanosauroidea and resolved Opisthocoelicaudia as the sister of Saltasaurus instead of the most basal titanosauroid. This result places Titanosauroidea in a group with Camarasaurus and Brachiosaurus, although Nemegtosauridae (Nemegtosaurus and Quaesitosaurus) was still classified as the basalmost family of diplodocoids. Upchurch chose to use Titanosauroidea as a replacement name for Titanosauria due to the recommended use of Linnean taxonomy and ranks. In 1997, Leonardo Salgado et al. published a phylogenetic study on Titanosauriformes, including relationships within Titanosauria. They provided a definition for the clade of \\"including the most recent common ancestor of Andesaurus delgadoi and Titanosauridae and all of its descendants\\". Titanosauria resolved including the same two subclades as Bonaparte & Coria (1993), where Andesauridae was monotypic, only including the name genus, and Titanosauridae was all other titanosaurs. Titanosauria was additionally rediagnosed, with eye-shaped pleurocoels, forked infradiapophyseal , centro-parapophyseal laminae, procoelous anterior caudals, and a significantly longer pubis than ischium. Titanosauridae was less strongly defined because of the polytomy between Malawisaurus and Epachthosaurus, so some diagnostic eatures couldn't be resolved. Saltasaurinae was defined as the most recent ancestor of Neuquensaurus, Saltasaurus and its descendants, and diagnosed by short cervical , vertically compressed anterior caudals, and a posteriorly shifted anterior caudal neural spine. Mounted rearing skeleton of Epachthosaurus Contributing additional work to the systematics of titanosaurs, Spanish paleontologist Jos√© Sanz et al. published an additional study in 1999, utilizing both the names Titanosauria and Titanosauroidea in displaying their results. Similar to Upchurch (1995), Sanz et al. recovered Opisthocoelicaudia as a titanosauroid outside Titanosauria, while Titanosauria was redefined to include only the taxa classified by their study. Eutitanosauria was proposed as a name for the titanosaurs more derived than Epachthosaurus, and noted the presence of osteoderms as a probable synapomorphy of this clade. Aeolosaurus, Alamosaurus, Ampelosaurus and Magyarosaurus were looked at using their character list, but were considered too incomplete to add to the final study. Argentinian paleontologist Jaime Powell published his 1986 thesis in 2003, with revisions to bring his old work up to date, including the addition of more phylogenetics and the recognition of Titanosauria as a clade name. Using the datamatrix of Sanz et al. (1999) and modifying it to include additional taxa and some character changes, Powell found that titanosaurs formed mostly a single gradual radiation beginning with Epachthosaurus as the most basal titanosaur, and Ampelosaurus and Isisaurus as the most derived. Titanosauroidea (following Upchurch 1995), was distinguished by pre- and post- spinal laminae in anterior caudals, a laterally flared ilium, a lateral expansion of the upper femur, and strongly opisthocoelous posterior dorsals. Less inclusive, Titanosauria was diagnosed by horizontally facing dorsal , prominent procoelous anterioy caudals, and a ridge on the sternal plates. Within Titanosauria, Eutitanosauria was characterized by the absence of a hyposphene-hypantrum, no femoral fourth trochanter, and osteoderms. A small clade of Alamosaurus, Lirainosaurus and the \\"Peir√≥polis titanosaur\\" (Trigonosaurus) was resolved, and diagnosed by only a rotation of the tibia so the proximal end is perpendicular to the distal end. More derived clades, while resolved, were only weakly supported, or characterized by reversions of diagnostic traits of larger groups (below and left). Powell (2003) Curry- Rogers & Forster (2001) Rapetosaurus was described in 2001 by Kristina Curry- Rogers and Catherine Forster, who additionally provided a new phylogenetic analysis of Titanosauriformes (above and right). Titanosauria was strongly supported, distinguished by up to 20 characters depending on unknown traits in basal taxa. Similarly, Saltasaurinae was characterised by up to 16 traits, and the clade of Rapetosaurus and related taxa possessed four unique features. Nemegtosaurus and Quaesitosaurus were resolved within Titanosauria for the first time, after being placed in Diplodocoidea by multiple other analyses, because Rapetosaurus provided the first significant titanosaur cranial material with associated postcrania. All three genera were resolved in a clade together, although Curry-Rogers & Forster noted that it was possible the group was only resolved because no other titanosaurs had comparable cranial material. Opisthocoelicaudia was also nested deeply in Saltasaurinae, though a further investigation of titanosaur interrelationships was proposed. Mounted skeleton of a juvenile Rapetosaurus American paleontologist Jeff Wilson presented another revision of overall sauropod phylogeny in 2002, resolving strong support for most groups, and a similar result to Upchurch (1998) although with Euhelopus closest to titanosaurs instead of outside Neosauropoda. More internal clades were resolved for Titanosauria, with Nemegtosaurus and Rapetosaurus united within Nemegtosauridae, and Saltasauridae including two subfamilies, Opisthocoelicaudiinae and Saltasaurinae. Saltasauridae was defined as a node-stem triplet, where everything descended from the common ancestor of Opisthocoelicaudia and Saltasaurus was within Saltasauridae, and the subfamilies Saltasaurinae and Opisthocoelicaudiinae were for every taxon on one branch of the saltasaurid tree or the other. Wilson and Paul Upchurch followed this study up in 2003 with a significant revision of the type genus Titanosaurus, and revisited all the material that had been assigned to the genus while reviewing titanosaur inter-relationships. Because they found Titanosaurus to be a dubious name, they proposed that Linnaean-named groups Titanosauridae and Titanosauroidea should be considered invalid as well. Wilson & Upchurch (2003) supported the definition of Salgado et al. (1997) for Titanosauria, since it was oldest and most similar to the original content of the group when named by Bonaparte & Coria (1993). Lithostrotia (Upchurch et al. 2004) was defined to be Malawisaurus and all more derived titanosaurs, and the clade Eutitanosauria (Sanz et al. 1999) was considered a possible synonym of Saltasauridae. Wilson & Upchurch (2003) presented a reduced cladogram of Titanosauria, including only the most commonly-analyzed taxa from previous studies, resulting in a tree similar to that of Wilson (2002) but with Rapetosaurus and Nemegtosaurus excluded and Epachthosaurus included. Alamosaurus and Opisthocoelicaudia were united within Opisthocoelicaudiinae, Neuquensaurus and Saltasaurus formed Saltasaurinae, and Isisaurus placed as the next most derived titanosaurid. Holotype skeleton of Opisthocoelicaudia At the same time as Wilson & Upchurch redescribing the species of Titanosaurus, Saldago (2003) looked over the potential invalidity of the family Titanosauridae and redefined the internal clades of Titanosauria. Titanosauria was defined as more inclusive than Titanosauroidea, contrasting with earlier used by Upchurch (1995) and Sanz et al. (1999), as all taxa in Somphospondyli closer to Saltasaurus than Euhelopus. In order to create additional stability, Saldago also defined Andesauroidea for only Andesaurus, as every titanosaur closer to that genus than Saltasaurus, and also it's opposite Titanosauroidea as every titanosaur closer to Saltasaurus than Andesaurus. Next most inclusive, Salgado revitalised Titanosauridae to include everything descended from the ancestor of Epachthosaurus and Saltasaurus, and to replace the node-stem triplet of Saltasauridae, defined the clades Epachthosaurinae and Eutitanosauria as Epachthosaurus>Saltasaurus and Saltasaurus Life restoration of Rinconsaurus, a derived titanosaur possessing unique caudals that significantly change articular surfaces throughout the tail Following the clade definitions proposed in previous Salgado studies, Bernardo Gonz√°lez-Riga published two papers in 2003 describing new taxa in Titanosauria: Mendozasaurus, and Rinconsaurus (with Jorge O. Calvo). In both studies, the new taxa formed clades within Titanosauridae, although neither were named, and new diagnostic features were proposed for the family. For Mendozasaurus, the new genus grouped with Malawisaurus as basal within Titanosauridae, but because of the features of caudal vertebrae in these basal taxa, Gonz√°lez-Riga recommended revising the diagnosis of the family, instead of changing the content. The situation of caudals in Rinconsaurus also suggested procoelous caudals were no longer diagnostic, because in the tail of Rinconsaurus the vertebrae regularly changed their articular surfaces, being from procoelous caudals interspersed with amphicoelous, opisthocoelous and biconvex vertebrae. Rinconsaurus was then included in Aeolosaurini, a clade named the following year by Aldirene Franco-Rosas et al. containing everything closer to Aeolosaurus and Gondwanatitan than Saltasaurus or Opisthocoelicaudia. Only the three genera and various intermediate specimens were included in Aeolosaurini in their 2004 paper, with the tribe being considered to be within Saltasaurinae. The second edition of The Dinosauria, published in 2004, included newly described titanosaurs and other taxa reidentified as titanosaurs. Written by Upchurch, Paul Barrett and Peter Dodson, a review of Sauropoda included a more expansive Titanosauria for sauropods more derived than brachiosaurids. Titanosauria, defined as everything closer to Saltasaurus than Brachiosaurus, included a very large variety of taxa, and the new clade Lithostrotia was named for a large number of more derived taxa, although Nemegtosauridae was placed in Diplodocoidea following earlier publications of Upchurch. Lithostrotia adopted the distinguishing feature of strongly procoelous caudals, previously used for Titanosauria. =New phylogenetic frameworks= In 2005, Curry-Rogers proposed a new phylogenetic analysis that focused on the inter-relationships of Titanosauria and included the most expansive character and taxon list of any study before it. 364 characters were selected from all previous phylogenetic analyses and scored across 29 probable titanosaurs, ranging from the Late Jurassic African Janenschia to the large variety of Late Cretaceous global genera. Proposing her analysis as the basis for a new phylogenetic framework of Titanosauria, Curry-Rogers recommended only using named for clades that were very strongly supported. For the strict consensus, every taxon more derived than Brachiosaurus was in an unresolved polytomy except for a clade of Rapetosaurus and Nemegtosaurus, and one of Saltasaurinae. Within the recommended results, she only named Titanosauria, Lithostrotia, Saltasauridae, Saltasaurinae and Opisthocoelicaudiinae, because of the weakness of support (below and left). Curry-Rogers (2005) Carballido et al. (2017) Another form of composite matrix was created by Calvo, Gonz√°lez-Riga and Juan Porfiri in 2007, based upon multiple previous studies between 1997 and 2003. The final analysis included 15 titanosaurs and 65 characters, and the typical titanosaur subclades were resolved, Titanosauridae being used over Lithostrotia following Salgado (2003), and the new clade Rinconsauria for the clade of Rinconsaurus and Muyelensaurus. The new clade (defined as Rinconsaurus and Muyelensaurus) was placed as the sister taxon of Aeolosaurini, which together grouped with Rapetosaurus as sister to Saltasauridae. In the same year, Calvo et al. published another paper, describing the basal titanosaur Futalognkosaurus. The only difference in the resulting phylogeny, based on the matrix of the Calvo, Gonz√°lez-Riga & Porfiri (2007), was the addition of Futalognkosaurus as the sister taxon to Mendozasaurus in a clade Calvo et al. named Lognkosauria, defined by the two genera classified within it. A very similar result was also recovered by Gonz√°lez-Riga et al. in 2009 in a phylogenetic analysis based partially on that of Calvo et al. (2007), although Epachthosaurus was nested with Rapetosaurus outside the clades of aeolosaurines. Further updates and modifications were then made by Palbo Gallina & Apestegu√≠a in 2011, with the additions of Ligabuesaurus, Antarctosaurus, Nemegtosaurus and Bonitasaura and character updates to match, bringing the total to 77 characters and 22 taxa. Significantly contrasting the earlier results, internal relationships of Titanosauria were rearranged. Malawisaurus nested with Andesaurus in a clade of the basalmost titanosaurs outside Titanosauroidea, where Lirainosaurus, instead of being the basal member of the saltasaur-branch was instead basalmost titanosauroid. Lognkosauria moved to be within rinconsaurs, while Nemegtosauridae was resolved as the sister of Aeolosaurus and Gondwanatitan, and the rinconsaur-lognkosaur branch. Antarctosaurus was unstable, but placed in a polytomy with the lognkosaurs and rinconsaurs before being excluded. Saltasaurinae and its relationship with Opisthocoelicaudia remained the same. Skull of Tapuiasaurus macedoi Nemegtosauridae was additionally revised by Hussam Zaher et al. (2011) with the description of Tapuiasaurus, which nested closer to Rapetosaurus than Nemegtosaurus, with all three forming a clade of derived lithostrotians. Using the matrix of Wilson (2002), following the additions of a few cranial characters and Diamantinasaurus, Tangvayosaurus and Phuwiangosaurus, remained the same as originally found by Wilson but with Diamantinasaurus sister to Saltasauridae and the other two genera as basal titanosaurs outside Lithostrotia, since Titanosauria, while undefined, was labelled to include all taxa closer to Saltasaurus than Euhelopus. Following a revision of the skull of Tapuiasaurus, Wilson et al. (2016) rescored the analysis of Zaher et al. and recovered similar results for everything but Nemegtosauridae, where the family dissolved into a more basal Tapuiasaurus outside Lithostrota and Nemegtosaurus outside Saltasauridae. While non- titanosaur phylogeny remained identical in every single result, the topology within Titanosauria was very labile and prone to change with minor adjustments. Mounted skeleton of Futalognkosaurus dukei Also following the 2002 analysis of Wilson, Jos√© Carballido and colleagues published a redescription of Chubutisaurus in 2011, and utilized an updated Wilson matrix, expanded to 289 characters across 41 taxa, including 15 titanosaurs. The primary focus of the analysis was on the basal titanosauriform taxa, but Titanosauria was defined, as the most recent common ancestor of Andesaurus delgadoi and Saltasaurus loricatus, and all its descendants, although the only autapomorphy of the group recovered was the absence of a prominent ventral process on the scapula. This same matrix and basis of characters was further utilized and expanded for analyses on Tehuelchesaurus, Comahuesaurus and related rebbachisaurs, Europasaurus, and Padillasaurus, before being expanded upon once again in 2017 by Carballido et al. during the description of Patagotitan to 405 characters and 87 taxa, including 28 titanosaurs (above and right). The definition of Titanosauria was preserved following Salgado et al. (1997) as Andesaurus plus Saltasaurus. Eutitanosauria (closer to Saltasaurus than Epachthosaurus) was resolved as a very inclusive clade composed of two distinct branches, one leading to the larger-bodied lognkosaurs and the other to the smaller-bodied saltasaurs. On the lognkosaur branch of Eutitanosauria, there is a branch of lognkosaurs and one of Rinconsauria. Following Calvo, Gonz√°lez-Riga and Porfiri (2007), Rinconsauria was defined as Muyelensaurus plus Rinconsaurus, and Lognkosauria was defined as Mendozasaurus plus Futalognkosaurus. Rinconsauria included taxa typically found within Aeolosaurini as well, so Aeolosaurini was redefined as Aeolosaurus rionegrinus plus Gondwanatitan to preserve the original restricted content, otherwise the entire rinconsaur-lognkosaur branch would be classified within Aeolosaurini. Lithostrotia, Saltasauridae and Saltasaurinae had their definitions preserved from earlier studies, and included their typical content. Philip Mannion and colleagues redescribed Lusotitan in 2013, creating a new analysis of 279 characters drawn from significant previous analyses by Upchurch and Wilson supplemented by other studies. 63 sauropods were included, focusing on non- titanosaurian sauropods, although 14 probable titanosaurs were included. Unique to Mannion et al., continuous characters were distinguished in a run of the matrix, which resolved almost all of Somphospondyli within Titanosauria because of Andesaurus placing very basal in a large group of Andesauroidea. Titanosauroidea was tentatively retained as the opposite clade of titanosaurs, which included all other traditional titanosaurs, although it was noted because of the invalidity of Titanosaurus, Titanosauroidea should be considered an invalid name as well. While the original analysis didn't focus on titanosaurs, it was utilised during the descriptions of Savannasaurus and Diamantinasaurus, Yongjinglong, an osteology of Mendozasaurus, and redescribing Tendaguria. From these updates, an analysis of 548 characters and 124 taxa was published by Mannion et al. in 2019 for a redescription of Jiangshanosaurus and Dongyangosaurus, and additional revisions of Ruyangosaurus were made. No differentiation between continuous and discrete characters was made like performed by Mannion et al. (2013), but a large clade of Andesauroidea was still resolved with implied weights. Both redescribed Asian taxa, as well as Yongjinglong, previously considered derived titanosaurs related to Saltasauridae, were removed to outside the clade. In the description of Mansourasaurus, Sallam et al. (2017) published a phylogenetic analysis of Titanosauria including the most taxa of any analysis of the clade. In an updated version of the analysis, with the taxon Mnyamawamtuka added, Gorscak & O'Connor (2019) got similar results, with slightly different relationships within small clades. Humerus of Ampelosaurus (left) and Magyarosaurus (right), and femora of (left to right) Magyarosaurus, Lirainosaurus and Ampelosaurus Paleobiology =Diet= Fossilized dung associated with late Cretaceous titanosaurids has revealed phytoliths, silicified plant fragments, that offer clues to a broad, unselective plant diet. Besides the plant remains that might have been expected, such as cycads and conifers, discoveries published in 2005 revealed an unexpectedly wide range of monocotyledons, including palms and grasses (Poaceae), including ancestors of rice and bamboo, which has given rise to speculation that herbivorous dinosaurs and grasses co-evolved. =Nesting= Diagram showing titanosaur nest excavation and egg laying A large titanosaurid nesting ground was discovered in Auca Mahuevo, in Patagonia, Argentina and another colony has reportedly been discovered in Spain. Several hundred female saltasaurs dug holes with their back feet, laid eggs in clutches averaging around 25 eggs each, and buried the nests under dirt and vegetation. The small eggs, about in diameter, contained fossilised embryos, complete with skin impressions. The impressions showed that titanosaurs were covered in a mosaic armour of small bead-like scales. The huge number of individuals gives evidence of herd behavior, which, along with their armor, could have helped provide protection against large predators such as Abelisaurus. =Range= Patagotitan skeleton cast on display at the American Museum of Natural History The titanosaurs were the last great group of sauropods, which existed from about 136 to 66 million years ago, before the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event, and were the dominant herbivores of their time. The fossil evidence suggests they replaced the other sauropods, like the diplodocids and the brachiosaurids, which died out between the late Jurassic and the mid-Cretaceous Periods. Titanosaurs were widespread. In December 2011, Argentine scientists announced titanosaur fossils had been found on Antarctica‚Äîmeaning that titanosaur fossils have been found on all continents. They are especially numerous in the southern continents (then part of the supercontinent of Gondwana). Australia had titanosaurs around 96 million years ago: fossils have been discovered in Queensland of a creature around long. Remains have also been discovered in New Zealand. One of the largest ever titanosaur footprints was discovered in the Gobi desert in 2016. One of the oldest remains of this group was found from the Valley of the Dinosaurs, Para√≠ba state of Brazil, representing a 136-million-year-old subadult individual.  Exhibits  # The Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, has a permanent exhibit of a titanosaur skeleton named Maximo. The specimen belongs to one of the largest known dinosaurs, Patagotitan. The exhibit unseated the famous Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton named Sue. The Field Museum also has a mount of a real skeleton of a juvenile Rapetosaurus from Madagascar, and a right femur of Argyrosaurus from Argentina. # The Naturmuseum Senckenberg in Germany Argentinosaurus huinculensis # Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Canada Futalognkosaurus References Category:Kimmeridgian first appearances Category:Maastrichtian extinctions ","title":"Titanosauria"},{"id":"1139349","text":"Barceloneta may refer to: * Barceloneta, Puerto Rico, municipality in Puerto Rico * Barceloneta, Barcelona, beach and a neighborhood in the Ciutat Vella district of Barcelona, Spain ** Barceloneta (Barcelona Metro) * Barceloneta, the old nickname of the city of Alghero, Sardinia ","title":"Barceloneta"},{"id":"1139354","text":"William Gilbert (1799‚Äì1877) established Gilbert company, the manufacturer of sports equipment, in 1823.

The series follows the adventures of Ruff, a smart and steadfast cat and Reddy, a good-natured and brave (but not overly bright) dog and also was presented by Screen Gems, the television arm of Columbia Pictures. It premiered in December 1957 and ran for fifty episodes until April 1960, comprising three seasons. Hanna and Barbera created the series as the first of their fledgling television operation, first named H-B Enterprises. The \\"buddy\\" theme had previously been explored in their Tom and Jerry theatrical shorts, but unlike Tom and Jerry, Ruff and Reddy are not adversaries, but housemates and best friends. The series is notable as one of the earliest original animated television programs, and a pioneering use of limited animation techniques. History =Background= In 1957, the animation/director team of William Hanna and Joseph Barbera were terminated from an eighteen-year-long tenure at MGM Studios, producing the animated Tom and Jerry theatrical short subjects. Their staff, composed of 110 inkers, painters, and animators, were also let go. MGM found it more profitable to continually re-release older cartoons than produce new ones. Hanna and Barbera remained a partnership and invested $30,000 out of pocket into a new venture, H-B Enterprises. The duo began work on storyboards featuring new characters, the first among them Ruff, a cat, and Reddy, a dog. Hanna later equated their respective names with he and his partners' dispositions at the period in which they were created. They forged a deal with former MGM colleague George Sidney in which he forged a small percentage of the new company in return for acting as a business representative. Sidney arranged for a meeting at Screen Gems, who had at the time been considering re-entering the animation business. Feeling confidence in the Ruff and Reddy characters, the duo presented their proposal, along with a streamlined production budget employing limited animation. =Animation= Ruff and Reddy, as one of the first original animated series produced for television, pioneered the technique of limited animation. Limited animation would require far fewer drawings, and, by extension, less inking and painting. This method was employed by necessity, as higher budgets had been the cause for the collapse of the theatrical cartoon business. Hanna, in a six-page memo, had attempted to convince his superiors at MGM to employ economized techniques in order to reduce the cost of their short films, but received no response. At that time, he had estimated a six-minute cartoon to cost $17,500 if it employed the limited animation technique (down from the $35,000 budget the duo received at MGM). When pitching to Screen Gems, Hanna had worked down the numbers to a much smaller $3,000, and the duo were very confident the company would respond with great excitement. Screen Gems appreciated the show concept, but explained to the duo that the budget for television, still an experimental medium, would be very stringent. Eventually, the company gave the partnership an option to produce five five-minute segments, with an escalating budget starting from $2,700. Hanna described the process in his 1996 memoir, A Cast of Friends: \\"It was essential that we select only the key poses necessary to convincingly impart the illusion of movement in our cartoons.\\" This method often emphasizes close-ups, rather than full or medium shots. All in all, the production process for Ruff and Reddy was not dissimilar from the process used to create theatrical cartoons: a script was written, followed by a storyboard illustrating key poses. Afterwards, a recorded soundtrack with dialogue was used to create a \\"pose reel,\\" which would give the filmmakers a sense of timing. Watching pose reels during their MGM years had emphasized that simple key poses would be enough to demonstrate humor. Hanna believed the process in line with the nature of television during the period, stressing \\"intimacy rather than spectacle,\\" represented an entirely different viewing experience (a large movie screen versus a small, standard-dimension television screen). In addition to the quicker, cheaper production process, Hanna and Barbera made the decision to produce the segments in full color. \\"It was one of the smartest things we did,\\" Hanna said. \\"We said, 'Color will be here soon. Cartoons last forever. Let's go ahead and do them in color, and we'll be a jump ahead of the game.'\\" This strategy paid off in 1959, when color television was introduced. Ruff and Reddy also eschewed lavish, detailed background art for simple, colorful illustrations. =Writing and music= Hanna and Barbera were fond of the \\"ongoing comedic rapport\\" of cartoon duos, among them the Wile E. Coyote/Road Runner and Sylvester/Tweety rivalries of Warner Bros. cartoons. Their own creation at MGM, Tom and Jerry, had been a variation on this theme. With Ruff and Reddy, they decide to delete the nemesis theme and make the characters best friends instead. \\"Consequently, this softer relationship placed a greater emphasis on the humor and wit conveyed to the audience through dialogue,\\" wrote Hanna. Hanna wrote the series' theme music, in his first foray into theme music composition, which would become a staple of Hanna-Barbera for nearly 30 years. His goal to capture the spirit of the characters while also catching the listeners' ear, he penned the lyrics one morning while storyboarding, handing off the sheet music to musical director Hoyt Curtin, who composed the melody. Unlike Tom and Jerry, the two new characters would speak, and the duo held auditions to find voice artists. Mainly selecting those they worked with at MGM, Hanna and Barbera decided to cast Don Messick as Ruff and Daws Butler as Reddy. Messick and Butler became the main long-time voice actors of H&B; cartoons. Reception The series was set to be the opening and closing acts for a half-hour children's program airing on Saturday mornings. While they had screened the pilot episode prior to broadcast, Hanna later admitted he was nervous as to how the public would respond. He writes in his book that reviews in trade papers were mainly positive, deeming it an \\"entertaining and clever cartoon program.\\" NBC, following this success, signed the duo to a five-year contract to produce and develop additional animated television series. NBC paired the opening and closing episodes of the show (usually with a cliffhanger) with live segments and classic cartoons of The Fox and the Crow and Lil Abner directed by Frank Tashlin and produced by Dave Fleischer for Screen Gems.

Primitive tools that date to that period have been found. Stone Age remains have been found showing more permanent habitation during the Neolithic period, and by the Iron Age the area is known to have been occupied by the Celtic Cornovii tribe and possibly the Deceangli. The Romans occupied Cheshire for almost 400 years, from 70 AD, and created the town and fort of Deva Victrix, now Chester. After the Romans withdrew, Cheshire formed part of Mercia, an Anglo-Saxon kingdom, that saw invasions from the Welsh and Danes. The Norman Conquest in 1070 saw Cheshire harshly ruled by the occupiers as local people resented the invaders and rebelled. War again swept the county during the English Civil War in 1642, despite an attempt by local gentry to keep the county neutral. The industrial revolution saw population changes in Cheshire as farm workers moved to the factories of Manchester and Lancashire. In the 18th and 19th centuries there was a resurgence in the country houses of Cheshire and canals and railways were built. Contemporary Cheshire is now a ceremonial county administered by four unitary authorities; Cheshire East, Cheshire West and Chester, Halton, and Warrington. (Warrington, formerly in Lancashire, was added to Cheshire in 1974.) Cheshire retains the offices of Lord Lieutenant and High Sheriff for ceremonial purposes. Toponymy Cheshire's name was originally derived from an early name for Chester, and was first recorded as Legeceasterscir in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,Harris, B. E. and Thacker, A. T. (1987). p. 237. meaning the shire of the city of legions.Crosby, A. (1996). page 31. Although the name first appears in 980, it is thought that the county was created by Edward the Elder around 920. In the Domesday Book, Chester was recorded as having the name Cestrescir (Chestershire), derived from the name for Chester at the time. A series of changes that occurred as English itself changed, together with some simplifications and elision, resulted in the name Cheshire, as it occurs today. Prehistory Cheshire periodically lay under ice until the end of the Younger Dryas ice age about 11,500 years ago. However, primitive tools have been found that date to the Hoxnian Interglacial, between 400,000 and 380,000 years BP, showing that Cheshire was inhabited at that time, probably by Homo heidelbergensis. There is evidence of Old Stone Age (Paleolithic) occupation with axe heads being found at Tatton dating to 10,000 B.C. The Bridestones More permanent occupation of Cheshire occurred during the New Stone Age (Neolithic). For example, there is a chambered tomb known as the Bridestones, near Congleton. It belongs to the \\"megalithic culture\\" characterised by the practice of collective burial in stone-built chambers beneath mounds of earth and stone. It lies approximately three miles east of Congleton and is the oldest megalithic structure in the whole of Cheshire. Farming is also likely to have started to develop during the Neolithic period, with flint artefacts and burnt grain being found at Tatton dating to 2,600 B.C., and the Oversley Farm find. During Bronze Age, occupation of upland hill sites at Beeston Castle and Eddisbury hill fort suggested a move to a more military society. Into the Iron Age, Cheshire became occupied by the Celtic Cornovii, bordering the Brigantes to the North and the Deceangli and Ordovices to the West. The Cornovii tribe had their capital at The Wrekin, Shropshire and were known to trade in salt from mines at Middlewich and Northwich. For the important Oversley Farm (near Manchester Airport) neolithic and Bronze Age longhouse find, see Oversleyford#Oversley Farm. Roman Model of how Deva Victrix would probably have looked. The Romans arrived in the lands of the Cornovii in 48 AD and defeated them at a battle at The Wrekin. By 70 AD the Romans had founded the fortress and town of Deva Victrix, now Chester, according to ancient cartographer Ptolemy,Ptolemy (1992), Book II Chapter 2Mason (2001), p. 42. The fortress was 20% larger than other fortresses in Britannia built around the same time at York (Eboracum) and Caerleon (Isca Augusta);Carrington (2002), p. 33‚Äì35. this has led to the suggestion that the fortress, rather than London (Londinium), was intended to become the capital of the Roman province of Britannia Superior.Carrington (2002), p. 46. The civilian amphitheatre, which was built in the 1st century, could seat between 8,000 and 10,000 people. It is the largest known military amphitheatre in Britain,Carrington (2002), p. 54‚Äì56. and is also a Scheduled Monument. The Romans developed the settlements at Condate (Northwich) and Salinae (Middlewich) due to the importance as their salt mines Salt was very important in Roman society; and highly valued by the Roman occupation forces. Other Roman industries included smelting of lead at Runcorn and potteries at Wilderspool, though the county retained most of its rural character and native Britons tended more towards agriculture than industry. Chester was garrisoned by the legion until at least the late 4th century. Although the army had abandoned the fortress by 410 when the Romans retreated from Britannia,Mason (2001), p. 209‚Äì210. the civilian settlement continued (probably with some Roman veterans staying behind with their wives and children) and its occupants probably continued to use the fortress and its defences as protection from raiders from the Irish Sea. Mercian The Roman Empire fell in the 5th century, and the Romano-British established a number of petty kingdoms in its place. The region was on the boundary of Northumbria, Mercia and north Wales so turbulent times continued. In 616, √Üthelfrith of Northumbria defeated armies from the kingdoms of Powys and Gwynedd at the Battle of Chester and probably established the Anglo-Saxon position in the area from then on. Later in the 7th century, Cheshire formed part of the kingdom of Mercia. However, with increased invasions from Danes, the Anglo-Saxons extended and strengthened the walls of Chester for protection. This did not stop the Danes from taking Chester until eventually King Alfred, of Wessex and eventually Mercia, drove them out of the city in 894‚Äì895 and a peace treaty was agreed granting the Danes settlements in the Wirral, which can be seen by their Danish place names, such as Thingwall (from thing meaning 'a meeting place'). Alfred's daughter Ethelfleda, Lady of the Mercians, built the new Anglo-Saxon 'burh' at Chester. By the middle of the 7th century, Christianity had also become widespread, and one of the earliest churches was at Eccleston. Eccleston shows signs of Christian burials as early as 390 AD, the earliest known Christian burials in Cheshire. Towards the end of the 7th century, Saint Werburgh founded a religious institution on the present site of Chester's St John's Church which later became the first cathedral. By this time, the River Mersey is likely to have formed the natural boundary between Mercia and Northumbria. The threat was now from the Danish kingdom based at York, so the Mercian kingdom built a fort at Eddisbury in 914 to serve as a defence for Chester. All along the length of the River Mersey as far as Manchester, fortified defensive settlements were created, including Rhuddlan, Runcorn, Thelwall, Bakewell and Penwortham. During his reign of Edward the Elder parts of old Derbyshire were also added to the Mercian kingdom. These are now modern-day Longdendale and Macclesfield. By 930, relative peace reigned across the area until the Norman occupation. In 973, the Anglo Saxon Chronicle records that, two years after his coronation at Bath, King Edgar of England, came to Chester where he held his court in a palace in a place now known as Edgar's field near the old Dee bridge in Handbridge. After the kings swore fealty and allegiance they rowed him back to the palace. As he entered he is reported to have said that with so many kings' allegiance his successors could boast themselves to be kings of the English. Chester became headquarters of Eadric Streona in 1007,Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, 1007: the King's ealdorman of Cheshire, Staffordshire and Shropshire. This transferred to the governorship of the Earl of Mercia: firstly Leofric (c. 1030‚Äì1057); then √Ülfgar (1057‚Äì1062); and finally Edwin (1062‚Äì1070). Mercian place names can be seen throughout the county. They can be recognised by the suffix 'ham' (from the Saxon word 'hamm' meaning a settlement)-for example Frodsham, Eastham, Weaverham; and 'burgh' or 'bury' (meaning a fortified settlement or stronghold) such as Wrenbury and Prestbury. Norman William I led the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. Confiscation of lands by the conquerors led to resistance and dissent for many years, and Cheshire, as a remote part of the kingdom, provided the Normans with stiff resistance. This led the Normans to treat Cheshire particularly harshly with land and villages being destroyed, crops burned and people made homeless. In 1069 the final attempt at resistance was finally put down and Edwin and other Saxon landlords had their property confiscated and their land was passed to Norman lords. Edwin attempted another rebellion in 1071, but was betrayed and killed. Proof of the devastation can be seen from the Domesday survey of 1086 most of the lands in Cheshire were recorded as \\"wasta\\", or wasteland, as \\"abandoned or useless lands\\".Earl, Middlewich 900-1900 Prior to the conquest the lands had been fertile. Chester was sieged in 1070 and eventually sacked, largely demolished and devastated. With control of the county, William built a castle in Chester at a defensive location overlooking the River Dee from where it could dominate and control the city and therefore administer the county. The old Roman walls were repaired making Chester probably one of the most heavily defended cities in Britain at that time. Hugh d'Avranches William abolished the Earldom of Mercia and created a new Earldom of Chester. William made Hugh d'Avranches the first Earl.C. P. Lewis, 'Avranches, Hugh d', first earl of Chester (d. 1101)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 28 Oct 2007 Hugh was nicknamed Hugh Lupus, or wolf, and ruled almost autonomously and with the full authority of the King. Cheshire was therefore declared a County palatine, a title it still holds today.Harris, B. E. (Ed.) (1979). page 98. The county continued to be ruled and administered by Norman earls and they imposed their own courts of law, civil service and independent powers, until the 7th Earl, John, died without a male heir in 1237. By that time King Henry III had declared the female line of inheritance to be invalid and took back the title, passing it to his son, Prince Edward - later to become King Edward I. Ever since that time the eldest son of all English monarchs has held the title of Earl of Chester and the title was created in conjunction with the Prince of Wales. By the 13th century, so important were the city and castle at Chester regarded, that extensions were built to include a royal apartment for King Edward I during the various wars with the neighbouring Welsh. Many other Norman castles were subsequently constructed throughout the county of Cheshire in order to maintain the peace and to exert control over the disenchanted population of the region who bitterly hated their Norman overseers for many generations. Hundreds of Cheshire in Domesday Book. Areas highlighted in pink now principally Flintshire. The Cheshire of 1086, as recorded in the Domesday Book, was a larger county than it is today. With minor variations in spelling across sources, the complete list of hundreds of Cheshire at this time are: Atiscross, Bochelau, Chester, Dudestan, Exestan, Hamestan, Middlewich, Riseton, Roelau, Tunendune, Warmundestrou and Wilaveston.Harris, B. E., and Thacker, A. T. (1987); pages 340‚Äì341. It included two hundreds, Atiscross and Exestan, that later became part of North Wales, now principally Flintshire. At the time of the Domesday Book, it also included as part of Duddestan Hundred the area of land later known as Maelor Saesneg (which used to be a detached part of Flintshire). The area in between the Mersey and Ribble (referred to in the Domesday Book as \\"Inter Ripam et Mersam\\") formed part of the returns for Cheshire.Morgan (1978). pp.269c‚Äì301c,d.Sylvester (1980). p. 14. Although this has been interpreted to mean that at that time south Lancashire was part of Cheshire,Roffe (2000) more exhaustive research indicates that the boundary between Cheshire and what was to become Lancashire remained the River Mersey.Harris and Thacker (1987) write on page 252: Phillips and Phillips (2002); pp. 26‚Äì31.Crosby, A. (1996) writes on page 31: This period of uncertainty of the northern border lasted until 1182, when the land north of the Mersey became administered as part of the new county of Lancashire. Later, the hundreds of Atiscross and Exestan became part of Wales. Over the years the remaining ten hundreds consolidated to just seven with changed names: Broxton, Bucklow, Eddisbury, Macclesfield, Nantwich, Northwich, and Wirral. Markets had existed in Chester, Middlewich and Nantwich well before 1066, and the suffix \\"port\\" (meaning \\"market\\") suggests the likelihood in pre-Norman markets at towns like Stockport. However the 12th and 13th centuries saw an escalation of towns being granted market rights, probably as the local population grew more used to Norman rule. Aldford and Alderley markets were created in 1253; Macclesfield in 1261; Congleton in 1272 and Over in 1280. However competition was fierce and markets are known to have failed at Aldford, Coddington, Brereton and Burton before the start of the 14th century. In 1397 the county had lands in the march of Wales added to its territory, and was promoted to the rank of principality. This was because of the support the men of the county had given to King Richard II, in particular by his standing armed force of about 500 men called the \\"Cheshire Guard\\". As a result, the King's title was changed to \\"King of England and France, Lord of Ireland, and Prince of Chester\\". No other English county has been honoured in this way, although it lost the distinction on Richard's fall in 1399.Davies, R. R. 'Richard II and the Principality of Chester' in The Reign of Richard II: Essays in Honour of May McKisack, ed. F. R. H. Du Boulay and Caroline Baron (1971) 17th century Map of Cheshire showing the hundreds by Wenceslas Hollar (1607‚Äì1677) By the early 17th century, Cheshire had established its own gentry descended from the Normans stock. These families dominated trade, legal and community affairs and of course dominated land ownership. However, the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 changed this. People aligned with either the Royalist or Parliamentarian causes regardless of social status, but more due to their own conscience. Chester was a Royalist stronghold, while the market towns of Stockport, Knutsford, Nantwich, Congleton, Middlewich and Northwich remained in Parliamentarian hands. After initial skirmishes in 1642, there was an attempt by Cheshire gentry to keep the county neutral during the civil war. The Bunbury Agreement was agreed locally, but the strategic position of Cheshire and the port of Chester meant that national commanders could never accept the local neutrality and the forces ended up clashing in the First Battle of Middlewich in March 1643. The county saw many battles fought on its lands ‚Äî notably, the sieges of Nantwich and Chester. In August 1655, England was placed under military rule and Cheshire, Lancashire and North Staffordshire were governed by Charles Worsley. Riots were planned, even by Parliamentarians, notably Sir George Booth of Dunham Massey near Altrincham, though these were quashed and the leaders executed. Eventually military rule ended in 1658 and the monarchy was restored with King Charles II of England. In 1689, Henry, Duke of Norfolk, raised a regiment on the little Roodee in Chester in an effort to resist any attempt by James II to re-take the English throne. This regiment became the Cheshire Regiment and now forms part of the 1st Battalion, The Mercian Regiment (Cheshire). 18th and 19th centuries Tatton Hall At the end of the 18th century, land enclosure and district reorganisations took place. As well as local industries, industrialisation of the Lancashire and Manchester mill towns saw Cheshire farms abandoned as workers sought a better living in the industrial towns. These lands were absorbed into bigger estates culminating in 98% of Cheshire land belonging to only 26% of the population. For example, by 1870 Peckforton Castle was over . However, industrialisation also bought benefits to Cheshire. The completion of the Trent and Mersey Canal in 1777 and innovations such as the Anderton Boat Lift, allowed Cheshire cheese and salt to become major county exports. Also the silk industry was developing in Macclesfield, triggered by Charles Roe building a watermill in Macclesfield in 1744. Cheshire continued to develop into a wealthy county in the 19th century. Tatton Hall and Dunham Massey are examples of country houses developed during the period. The Egerton family extensively remodelled Tatton Hall between 1760 and 1820, and the 17th-century house at Dunham Massey saw significant 19th century development and expansion. The railways came through Cheshire in the 1830s. The Grand Junction Railway was authorised by Parliament in 1833 and designed by George Stephenson and Joseph Locke. It opened for business on 4 July 1837, running for from Birmingham through Wolverhampton, Stafford, Crewe, Hartford and Warrington, then via the existing Warrington and Newton Railway to join the Liverpool and Manchester Railway at a triangular junction at Newton Junction. The GJR established its chief engineering works at Crewe, moving there from Edge Hill, in Liverpool. metropolitan counties in 1974 In 1874, John Brunner and Ludwig Mond founded Brunner Mond in Winnington near Northwich and started manufacturing soda ash using the Solvay ammonia-soda process. This process used salt as a main raw material. The chemical industry used the subsided land for the disposal of waste from the manufacture of soda- ash. The waste was transported through a network of cranes and rails to the produce limebeds. This was a dangerous alkaline substance and caused the landscape to be abandoned as unusable. Bartholomew's Gazetteer of the British Isles (1887) described Cheshire's industry: The 19th century also saw the creation of formal civic organisations in Cheshire. Cheshire Constabulary was founded in 1857 and Cheshire County Council was created in 1889. 20th and 21st centuries Through the Local Government Act 1972, which came into effect on 1 April 1974, some areas in the north-west became part of the metropolitan counties of Greater Manchester and Merseyside. Stockport (previously a county borough), Hyde, Dukinfield and Stalybridge in the north-east became part of Greater Manchester. Much of the Wirral Peninsula in the north-west, including the county boroughs of Birkenhead and Wallasey, joined Merseyside. At the same time the Tintwistle Rural District was transferred to Derbyshire. The area of Lancashire south of the Merseyside/Greater Manchester area, including Widnes and the county borough of Warrington, was added to the new non-metropolitan county of Cheshire.Local Government Act 1972 Halton and Warrington became unitary authorities independent of Cheshire County Council on 1 April 1998, but remain part of Cheshire for ceremonial purposes and also for fire and policing. Four unitary authorities of Cheshire A referendum for a further local government reform connected with an elected regional assembly was planned for 2004, but was abandoned ‚Äì see Northern England referendum, 2004. As part of the local government restructuring in April 2009, Cheshire County Council and the Cheshire districts were abolished and replaced by two new unitary authorities, Cheshire East and Cheshire West and Chester. The existing unitary authorities of Halton and Warrington were not affected by the change. Cheshire is now a ceremonial county administered by four unitary authorities; Cheshire East, Cheshire West and Chester, Halton, and Warrington. Cheshire retains the offices of Lord Lieutenant and High Sheriff for ceremonial purposes under the Lieutenancies Act 1997. Policing and fire and rescue services continue to be provided across all four areas together, with the Cheshire Police Authority and Cheshire Fire Authority consisting of members of the four councils.

Continuous occupation started around 10,000 years ago after the end of the last ice age. When recorded history started in the first century BCE, the spoken language was Common Brittonic, and that would develop into Southwestern Brittonic and then the Cornish language. Cornwall was part of the territory of the tribe of the Dumnonii that included modern-day Devon and parts of Somerset. After a period of Roman rule, Cornwall reverted to rule by independent Romano-British leaders and continued to have a close relationship with Brittany and Wales as well as southern Ireland, which neighboured across the Celtic Sea. After the collapse of Dumnonia, the remaining territory of Cornwall came into conflict with neighbouring Wessex. By the middle of the ninth century, Cornwall had fallen under the control of Wessex, but it kept its own culture. In 1337, the title Duke of Cornwall was created by the English monarchy, to be held by the king's eldest son and heir. Cornwall, along with the neighbouring county of Devon, maintained Stannary institutions that granted some local control over its most important product, tin, but by the time of Henry VIII most vestiges of Cornish autonomy had been removed as England became an increasingly centralised state under the Tudor dynasty. Conflicts with the centre took place with the Cornish Rebellion of 1497 and Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549. By the end of the 18th century, Cornwall was administered as an integral part of the Kingdom of Great Britain along with the rest of England and the Cornish language had gone into steep decline. The Industrial Revolution brought huge change to Cornwall, as well as the adoption of Methodism among the general populace, turning the area nonconformist. Decline of mining in Cornwall resulted in mass emigration overseas and the Cornish diaspora, as well as the start of the Celtic Revival and Cornish revival which resulted in the beginnings of Cornish nationalism in the late 20th century. Cornwall's Early Medieval history, in particular the early Welsh and Breton references to a Cornish King named Arthur, have featured in such legendary works as Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, predating the Arthurian legends of the Matter of Britain (see the list of legendary rulers of Cornwall). Pre-Roman Cornwall =Stone Age= Cornwall was only sporadically occupied during the Palaeolithic, but people returned around 10,000 years ago in the Mesolithic, after the end of the last ice age. There is substantial evidence of occupation by hunter gatherers in this period. The upland areas of Cornwall were the parts first open to settlement as the vegetation required little in the way of clearance: they were perhaps first occupied in Neolithic times (Palaeolithic remains are almost non-existent in Cornwall). Many megaliths of this period exist in Cornwall and prehistoric remains in general are more numerous in Cornwall than in any other English county except Wiltshire. The remains are of various kinds and include menhirs, barrows and hut circles.Hencken, H. O'Neill (1932) The Archaeology of Cornwall and Scilly. London: Methuen.Pevsner, Nikolaus (1970). Cornwall. \\"Introduction: Prehistory,\\" pp. 25‚Äì29. Penguin Books =Bronze Age= M√™n-an-Tol (\\"Holed stone\\"), an Early Bronze Age monument near Madron, in the far west of Cornwall. Cornwall and neighbouring Devon had large reserves of tin, which was mined extensively during the Bronze Age by people associated with the Beaker culture. Tin is necessary to make bronze from copper, and by about 1600 BCE the West Country was experiencing a trade boom driven by the export of tin across Europe. This prosperity helped feed the skilfully wrought gold ornaments recovered from Wessex culture sites. There is evidence of a relatively large-scale disruption of cultural practices around the 12th century BCE that some scholars think may indicate an invasion or migration into southern Britain. =Iron Age= A map of camps and earthworks in Cornwall Around 750 BCE the Iron Age reached Britain, permitting greater scope of agriculture through the use of new iron ploughs and axes. The building of hill forts also peaked during the British Iron Age. During broadly the same time (900 to 500 BCE), Celtic cultures and peoples spread across the British Isles. During the British Iron Age Cornwall, like all of Britain south of the Firth of Forth, was inhabited by Celts known as the Britons. The Celtic language spoken at the time, Common Brittonic, eventually developed into several distinct tongues, including Cornish.Philip Payton. (1996). Cornwall: A History. Fowey: Alexander Associates The first account of Cornwall comes from the Sicilian Greek historian Diodorus Siculus (c. 90 BCE ‚Äì c. 30 BCE), supposedly quoting or paraphrasing the 4th-century BCE geographer Pytheas, who had sailed to Britain: Iron Age Celtic tribes of Southern Britain. A map of inscription stones, with and without Ogham inscriptions. Claims have been made that the Phoenicians traded directly with Cornwall for tin. There is no archaeological evidence for this and modern historians have debunked earlier antiquarian constructions of \\"the Phoenician legacy of Cornwall\\",Halliday, p.52. pp. 107, 132 pp.123‚Äì131 (Chapter 21 \\"The Phoenician myth\\") p. 21. including belief that the Phoenicians even settled Cornwall. =Toponymy= By the time that Classical written sources appear, Cornwall was inhabited by tribes speaking Celtic languages. The ancient Greeks and Romans used the name Belerion or Bolerium for the south-west tip of the island of Britain, but the late-Roman source for the Ravenna Cosmography (compiled about 700 CE) introduces a place-name Puro coronavis, the first part of which seems to be a misspelling of Duro (meaning Fort). This appears to indicate that the tribe of the Cornovii, known from earlier Roman sources as inhabitants of an area centred on modern Shropshire, had by about the 5th century established a power-base in the south-west (perhaps at Tintagel).Cornwall Guide Ancient History page. The tribal name is therefore likely to be the origin of Kernow or later Curnow used for Cornwall in the Cornish language. John Morris suggested that a contingent of the Cornovii was sent to South West Britain at the end of the Roman era, to rule the land there and keep out the invading Irish, but this theory was dismissed by Professor Philip Payton in his book Cornwall: A History. The Cornish Cornovii may even be a completely separate tribe, taking their name from the horn shape of the peninsula. The English name, Cornwall, comes from the Celtic name, to which the Old English word Wealas \\"foreigner\\" is added. In pre-Roman times, Cornwall was part of the kingdom of Dumnonia, and was later known to the Anglo-Saxons as \\"West Wales\\", to distinguish it from \\"North Wales\\" (modern-day Wales). Roman Cornwall During the time of Roman dominance in Britain, Cornwall was rather remote from the main centres of Romanisation. The Roman road system extended into Cornwall, but the only known significant Roman sites are three forts:- Tregear near Nanstallon was discovered in early 1970s, the other two found more recently at Restormel Castle, Lostwithiel (discovered 2007) and a fort near to St Andrew's Church in Calstock (discovered early in 2007). A Roman style villa was found at Magor Farm near Camborne.Roman-British Villa Magor Farm , Illogan, Redruth, Cornwall. Pottery and other evidence suggesting the presence of an ironworks have been found at the undisclosed location near St Austell, Cornwall. Experts say the discovery challenges the belief that Romans did not settle in the county and stopped in east Devon where Isca Dumnoniorum became a flourishing provincial capital of the Dumnonii. Prof Barry Cunliffe notes that \\"in the southwest peninsula of Devon & Cornwall the lack of Romanization, after a brief military occupation in the first century, is particularly striking. West of Exeter the native socio-economic system simply continued unhindered\\".The Ancient Celts, 2nd ed., Cunliffe (2018) Furthermore, the British tin trade had been largely eclipsed by the more convenient supply from Iberia although Cunliffe's excavations at Mount Batten and a recent find of tin ingots at Burgh Island in West Devon indicate that cross channel trade continued. The Roman milestone in St Materiana's Church, Tintagel Only a few Roman milestones have been found in Cornwall; two have been recovered from around Tintagel in the north, one at Mynheer Farm near the hill fort at Carn Brea, Redruth, another two close to St Michael's Mount, one of which is preserved at Breage Parish Church, and one in St Hilary's Church, St Hilary (Cornwall). The stone at Tintagel Parish Church bears an inscription to Imperator Caesar Licinius, and the other stone at Trethevy is inscribed to the Imperial Caesars Trebonianus Gallus and Volusianus.Roman Milestones near Nanstallon The Trethevy stone can be dated c. 252 as both Caesars died in the following year. According to L√©on Fleuriot, however, Cornwall remained closely integrated with neighbouring territories by well-travelled sea routes. Fleuriot suggests that an overland route connecting Padstow with Fowey and Lostwithiel served, in Roman times, as a convenient conduit for trade between Gaul (especially Armorica) and the western parts of the British Isles.Fleuriot, L√©on (1982) Les Origines de la Bretagne. Paris: Payot; p. 18 Archaeological sites at Chysauster Ancient Village and Carn Euny in West Penwith and the Isles of Scilly demonstrate a uniquely Cornish 'courtyard house' architecture built in stone of the Roman period, entirely distinct from that of southern Britain, yet with parallels in Atlantic Ireland, North Britain and the Continent, and influential on the later development of stone- built fortified homesteads known in Cornwall as \\"Rounds\\". Post-Roman and Medieval periods King Doniert's Stone, memorial High cross to Dungarth, the last recorded King of Cornwall 875 CE. The kingdom of Dumnonia around the year 800. West Wales and Wessex 936. In the wake of the Roman withdrawal from Great Britain in about 410, Saxons and other Germanic peoples were able to conquer and settle most of the east of the island over the next two centuries. In the west, Devon and Cornwall held out as the British kingdom of Dumnonia. Dumnonia had close cultural contacts with Christian Ireland, Wales, Romano-Celtic Brittany and Byzantium via the West Atlantic trade network, and there is exceptional archaeological evidence for Late Antique trading contacts at the stronghold of Tintagel in Cornwall.Excavations at Tintagel Castle, Cornwall, 1990‚Äì1999, R Barrowman, C Batey, C Morris, Society of Antiquities, London 2007 The Breton language is closer to Cornish than to Welsh, showing the close contacts between the areas.Charles-Edwards, Wales and the Britons, p. 23 =Relationship with Wessex= The early kings of Wessex are notable for their possible prevalence of Brythonic namesDavid Dumville: Britons and Anglo Saxons in the Early Middle Ages : The West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List and the chronology of Wessex [1977] and therefore care should be exercised in assuming a stark ethnic antipathy between emergent 'British' and 'English' identities, peoples and culture; rather a struggle for dominance of warring elites more or less aligned with eastern 'Germanic' and western 'Romano-Celtic' cultures and peoples. Atlantic Brythons were often recorded in alliance with Scandinavian forces such as the Danes, or Normans in Brittany, up to the period of the Norman Conquest.La Bretagne; des origines a nos jours; Bernard Medrignac, Editions Ouest France, 2009 In the early eighth century, Cornwall was probably a sub-division of Dumnonia, and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that in 710, Geraint, king of Dumnonia, fought against Ine, king of Wessex. The Annales Cambriae states that in 722, the Battle of Hehil \\"among the Cornishmen\\" was won by the Britons. In the view of the historian Thomas Charles-Edwards, this probably indicates that Dumnonia had fallen by 722, and that the British victory of that year against Wessex secured the survival of the new kingdom of Cornwall for another one hundred and fifty years. There were intermittent battles between Wessex and Cornwall for the rest of the eighth century, and Cuthred, king of Wessex, fought against the Cornish in 743 and 753.Charles- Edwards, Wales and the Britons pp. 428‚Äì430 However, according to John Reuben Davies, Dumnonia ceased to exist around the beginning of the ninth century, but: :The kingdom of Cornwall, on the other hand, remained as an independent British territory in the face of pressure from Wessex, cut off from fellow Brittonic-speakers in Wales and Brittany by the sea and the West Saxons.Davies, \\"Wales and the West\\", p. 341 In 814, King Egbert of Wessex ravaged Cornwall \\"from the east to the west\\", and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that in 825 the Cornish fought the men of Devon. In 838 the Cornish in alliance with Vikings were defeated by the West Saxons at the Battle of Hingston Down.This was probably the Hingston Down in east Cornwall, although there is also a Hingston Down in Devon. (Charles-Edwards, Wales and the Britons, p. 431) This was the last recorded battle between Cornwall and Wessex, and possibly resulted in the loss of Cornish independence. In 875, the Annales Cambriae record that king Dungarth of Cornwall drowned, yet Alfred the Great had been able to go hunting in Cornwall a decade earlier suggesting Dungarth was likely an under-king. Kenstec (c.833-c.870) became the first bishop of Cornwall to profess obedience to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and in the same period the bishop of Sherborne was instructed to visit Cornwall annually to \\"root out the errors of the Cornish Church\\", further indications that Cornwall was becoming subject to Wessex in the middle of the ninth century.Davies, \\"Wales and the West\\" p. 342Charles-Edwards, Wales and the Britons, p. 431 In the 880s Alfred the Great was able to leave estates in Cornwall in his will.Keynes & Lapidge eds, Alfred the Great, p. 175 William of Malmesbury, writing around 1120, says that in about 927, King √Üthelstan of England expelled the Cornish from Exeter and fixed Cornwall's eastern boundary at the River Tamar. T. M. Charles-Edwards dismisses William's account as an \\"improbable story\\" on the ground that Cornwall was by then firmly under English control.Charles-Edwards, Wales and the Britons, pp. 22, 432 John Reuben Davies sees the expedition as the suppression of a British uprising, which was followed by the confinement of the Cornish beyond the Tamar and the creation of a separate bishopric for Cornwall.Davies, \\"Wales and the West\\", p. 343 Although English kings granted land in the eastern part in the ninth century, no grants are recorded in the western half until the mid-tenth century.Oliver Padel, \\"Cornwall\\" Cornwall now acquired Anglo-Saxon administrative features such as the hundred system. Unlike Devon, Cornwall's culture was not anglicised. Most people still spoke Cornish, and place-names are still mainly Brittonic. In 944 √Üthelstan's successor, Edmund I, styled himself 'King of the English and ruler of this province of the Britons'.Todd, The South West to AD 1000, pp. 287‚Äì9. The antiquarian William Camden wrote in his book Britannia in 1607: :As for those Cornwallians, although they stoutly bent all their force together in defence of their Countrey, yet soone became they subject to the Saxons, as who neither matched then in number, neither was their Countrey sufficiently fenced by nature to defend them.Camden, Britannia =The Cornish Church= The first centuries after the Romans left are known as the 'age of the saints', as Celtic Christianity and a revival of Celtic art spread from Ireland, Wales and Scotland into Great Britain, Brittany, and beyond. According to tradition the area was evangelised in the 5th and 6th centuries by the children of Brychan Brycheiniog and saints from Ireland. Cornish saints such as Piran, Meriasek, or Geraint exercised a religious and arguably political influence; they were often closely connected to the local civil rulers and in some cases were kings themselves. There was an important monastery at Bodmin and sporadically, Cornish bishops are named in various records. Will of Alfred the Great, AD 873‚Äì888 (11th-century copy, British Library Stowe MS 944, ff. 29v‚Äì33r)Charter S 1507 at the Electronic Sawyer By the 880s more Saxon priests were being appointed to the Church in Cornwall and they controlled some church estates like Polltun, Caellwic and Landwithan (Pawton, in St Breock; perhaps Celliwig (Kellywick in Egloshayle?); and Lawhitton. Eventually they passed these over to Wessex kings. However, according to Alfred the Great's will the amount of land he owned in Cornwall was very small. West of the Tamar Alfred the Great only owned a small area in the Stratton region, plus a few other small estates around Lifton on Cornish soil east of the Tamar). These were provided to him through the Church whose Canterbury appointed priesthood was increasingly English dominated. The early organisation and affiliations of the Church in Cornwall are unclear, but in the mid-9th century it was led by a Bishop Kenstec with his see at Dinurrin, a location which has sometimes been identified as Bodmin and sometimes as Gerrans. Kenstec acknowledged the authority of Ceolnoth, bringing Cornwall under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Canterbury. In the 920s or 930s King Athelstan established a bishopric at St Germans to cover the whole of Cornwall, which seems to have been initially subordinated to the see of Sherborne but emerged as a full bishopric in its own right by the end of the 10th century. The first few bishops here were native Cornish, but those appointed from 963 onwards were all English. From around 1027, the see was held jointly with that of Crediton, and in 1050, they were merged to become the diocese of Exeter. =The 11th century= King Cnut, Wales and Cornwall fell outside his British realms In 1013 Wessex was conquered by a Danish army under the leadership of the Viking leader and King of Denmark Sweyn Forkbeard. Sweyn annexed Wessex to his Viking empire which included Denmark and Norway. He did not, however, annex Cornwall, Wales and Scotland, allowing these \\"client nations\\" self-rule in return for an annual payment of tribute or \\"danegeld\\". Between 1013 and 1035 Cornwall, Wales, much of Scotland and Ireland were not included in the territories of King Canute the Great.Shepherd, William R. (1911) Historical Atlas. \\"Dominions of Cnut\\". The chronology of English expansion into Cornwall is unclear, but it had been absorbed into England by the reign of Edward the Confessor (1042‚Äì1066), when it apparently formed part of Godwin's and later Harold's earldom of Wessex.Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (2000), p.177. The Old English word translated by Swanton as \\"Cornwall\\" is \\"Wealas\\", which some translations render as \\"Wales\\". However, in the Anglo-Saxon period this terminology was applied equally to all Brythonic people and their lands, not specifically to Wales and the Welsh in the modern sense. Since this reference concerns a parcel of adjoining territories contiguous with Cornwall but not with Wales, and since Wales was not under English rule at this date whereas the evidence of Domesday Book indicates that Cornwall was, it may reasonably be concluded that the land in question was \\"West Wales\\" (i.e. Cornwall), not \\"North Wales\\". The records of Domesday Book show that by this time the native Cornish landowning class had been almost completely dispossessed and replaced by English landowners, the largest of whom was Harold Godwinson himself.Williams, Ann and Martin, G. H. (tr.) (2002) Domesday Book: a complete translation, London: Penguin, pp. 341‚Äì357. The Cornish language continued to be spoken, particularly in west and mid Cornwall, and acquired a number of characteristics establishing its identity as a separate language from Breton. However, Cornwall showed a very different type of settlement pattern from that of Saxon Wessex and places continued, even after 1066, to be named in the Celtic Cornish tradition.Mills, Jon (2010) Genocide and Ethnocide: The Suppression of the Cornish Language. In: Interfaces in Language. Cambridge Scholars, pp. 189‚Äì206. . Mills argues that the Breton rulers of Cornwall, as allies of the Normans, brought about an 'Armorican Return' with Cornu-Breton retaining its status as a prestige language. =Post Norman conquest (1066‚Äì1485)= Tintagel Castle: part of ruined curtain wall According to William Worcester, writing in the 15th century, Cadoc (Cornish: Kadog) was a survivor of the Cornish royal line and was appointed as the first Earl of Cornwall by William the Conqueror following the Norman conquest of England. In 1068 Brian of Brittany, son of Eudes, Count of Penthi√®vre, was created Earl of Cornwall, and naming evidence cited by medievalist Edith Ditmas suggests that many other post-Conquest landowners in Cornwall were Breton allies of the Normans, the Bretons being descended from Britons who had fled to what is today France during the early years of the Anglo-Saxon conquest. and further proposed this period for the early composition of the Tristan and Iseult cycle by poets such as B√©roul from a pre-existing shared Brittonic oral tradition.E. M. R. Ditmas (1969) Tristan and Iseult Twelfth Century Romance by Beroul retold from Norman French Earl Brian defeated a second raid in the southwest of England, launched from Ireland by Harold's sons in 1069. Brian was granted lands in Cornwall but by 1072 he had probably returned to Brittany: he died without issue. Much of the land in Cornwall was seized and transferred into the hands of a new Norman aristocracy, with the lion's share going to Robert, Count of Mortain, half- brother of King William and the largest landholder in England after the king. Some land was held by King William and by existing monasteries ‚Äì the remainder by the Bishop of Exeter, and a single manor each by Judhael of Totnes and GotshelmDomesday Book, tr. Williams and Martin, pp. 341‚Äì357. (brother of Walter de Claville). Robert became Earl in succession to Brian; nothing is known of Cadoc apart from what William Worcester says four centuries later. Four Norman castles were built in east Cornwall at different periods, at Launceston, Trematon, Restormel and Tintagel. A new town grew up around Launceston castleThe name Launceston belonged in Anglo-Saxon times to St Stephen's by Launceston (lan stefan tun) where there was a monastery. and this became the capital of the county. On several occasions over the following centuries noblemen were created Earl of Cornwall, but each time their line soon died out and the title lapsed until revived for a new appointee. In 1336, Edward, the Black Prince was named Duke of Cornwall, a title that has been awarded to the eldest son of the Sovereign since 1421. A popular Cornish literature, centred on the religious-themed mystery plays, emerged in the 14th century (see Cornish literature) based around Glasney College‚Äîthe college established by the Bishop of Exeter in the 13th century. It has been claimed as one of the great ironies of history that three Cornish-speaking Cornishmen brought the English language back from the verge of extinction ‚Äì John of Cornwall, John Trevisa and Richard Pencrych. John of Trevisa was a Cornish cleric instrumental in translation of the Bible into English under John Wycliffe's proto-Reformation and, ironically for a Cornish-speaker, is the third most cited source for the very first appearance of many words in the English language. He also added many notes to his translation c. 1387 of the Polychronicon relating to the geography and culture of Cornwall. Norman absentee landlords became replaced by a new Cornish-Norman ruling class including scholars such as Richard Rufus of Cornwall. These families eventually became the new rulers of Cornwall, typically speaking Norman French, Breton-Cornish, Latin, and eventually English, with many becoming involved in the operation of the Stannary Parliament system, the Earldom and eventually the Duchy of Cornwall.Payton (2004), chapter 5. The Cornish language continued to be spoken and acquired a number of characteristics establishing its identity as a separate language from Breton. Tudor and Stuart period =1485‚Äì1603= The general tendency of administrative centralisation under the Tudor dynasty began to undermine Cornwall's distinctive status. For example, under the Tudors, the practice of distinguishing between some laws, such as those related to the tin industry, that applied simply in Anglia or in Anglia et Cornubia (in England and Cornwall) ceased. The Cornish Rebellion of 1497 originated among Cornish tin miners who opposed the raising of taxes by Henry VII to make war on Scotland. This levy was resented for the economic hardship it would cause; it also intruded on a special Cornish tax exemption. The rebels marched on London, gaining supporters as they went, but were defeated at the Battle of Deptford Bridge. The Cornish also rose up in the Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549. Much of south-western Britain rebelled against the Act of Uniformity 1549, which introduced the obligatory use of the Protestant Book of Common Prayer. Cornwall was mostly Catholic in sympathy at this time; the Act was doubly resented in Cornwall because the Prayer Book was in English only and most Cornish people at this time spoke the Cornish language rather than English. They therefore wished church services to continue to be conducted in Latin; although they did not understand this language either, it had the benefit of long-established tradition and lacked the political and cultural connotations of the use of English. Twenty percent of the Cornish population are believed to have been killed during 1549: it is one of the major factors that contributed to the decline in the Cornish language.Rowse, A. L. (1941) Tudor Cornwall. London: Cape. =English Civil War (1642‚Äì1649)= Maps of territory held by Royalists (red) and Parliamentarians (green), 1642‚Äì1645 Cornwall played a significant role during the English Civil War, as it was a Royalist enclave in the generally Parliamentarian south-west. The reason for this was that Cornwall's rights and privileges were tied up with the royal Duchy and Stannaries and so the Cornish saw the King as protector of their rights and Ducal privileges. The strong local Cornish identity also meant the Cornish would resist any meddling in their affairs by any outsiders. The English Parliament wanted to reduce royal power. Parliamentary forces invaded Cornwall three times and burned the Duchy archives. In 1645 Cornish Royalist leader Sir Richard Grenville, 1st Baronet made Launceston his base and he stationed Cornish troops along the River Tamar and issued them with instructions to keep \\"all foreign troops out of Cornwall\\". Grenville tried to use \\"Cornish particularist sentiment\\" to muster support for the Royalist cause and put a plan to the Prince which would, if implemented, have created a semi- independent Cornwall.Stoyle, Mark (2002).

The epicentre was approximately off Cape St Vincent on the Portuguese coast, over south west of the Lizard. At St Michael's Mount, the sea rose suddenly and then retired, ten minutes later it rose very rapidly, then ebbed equally rapidly, and continued to rise and fall for five hours. The sea rose in Penzance and at Newlyn. The same effect was reported at St Ives and Hayle. The 18th-century French writer, Arnold Boscowitz, claimed that \\"great loss of life and property occurred upon the coasts of Cornwall\\".Cornwall Council. Sources of Cornish History ‚Äì The Lisbon Earthquake =Developments in tin mining= Richard Trevithick's steam engine. At one time the Cornish were the world's foremost experts of mining (See Mining in Cornwall and Devon ) and a School of Mines was established in 1888. As Cornwall's reserves of tin began to be exhausted, many Cornishmen emigrated to places such as the Americas, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa where their skills were in demand. There is no current tin mining undertaken in Cornwall. However, a popular legend says that wherever you may go in the world, if you see a hole in the ground, you'll find a Cornishman at the bottom of it. Several Cornish mining words are in use in English language mining terminology, such as costean, gunnies, and vug. Since the decline of tin mining, agriculture and fishing, the area's economy has become increasingly dependent on tourism‚Äîsome of Britain's most spectacular coastal scenery can be found here. However, Cornwall is one of the poorest parts of Western Europe and it has been granted Objective 1 status by the EU. In 2019, Canadian mining company, Strongbow Exploration announced it was looking to resume tin mining at South Crofty. =Politics, religion and administration= Cornwall and Devon were the site of a Jacobite rebellion in 1715 led by James Paynter of St. Columb. This coincided with the larger and better-known \\"Fifteen Rebellion\\" which took place in Scotland and the north of England. However, the Cornish uprising was quickly quashed by the authorities. James Paynter was tried for High Treason but claiming his right as a Cornish tinner was tried in front of a jury of other Cornish tinners and was cleared. Industrialised communities have long appeared to weaken the pre-eminence of the Church of England, and as the Cornish people were readily involved in mining, a rift developed between the Cornish people and their Anglican clergy in the early 18th century.Cornwall County Council ‚Äì Cornish Methodism Resisting the established church, many ordinary Cornish people were Roman Catholic or non-religious until the late 18th century, when Methodism was introduced to Cornwall during a series of visits by John and Charles Wesley. Methodist separation from the Church of England was made formal in 1795. In 1841 there were ten hundreds of Cornwall: Stratton, Lesnewth and Trigg; East and West Wivelshire; Powder; Pydar; Kerrier; Penwith; and Scilly. The shire suffix has been attached to several of these, notably: the first three formed Triggshire; East and West appear to be divisions of Wivelshire; Powdershire and Pydarshire. The old names of Kerrier and Penwith have been re-used for modern local government districts. The ecclesiastical division within Cornwall into rural deaneries used versions of the same names though the areas did not correspond exactly: Trigg Major, Trigg Minor, East Wivelshire, West Wivelshire, Powder, Pydar, Kerrier and Penwith were all deaneries of the Diocese of Exeter but boundaries were altered in 1875 when five more deaneries were created (from December 1876 all in the Diocese of Truro).Cornish Church Guide (1925). Truro: Blackford = Smuggling heyday = The peak of smuggling in Cornwall was evident in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Import taxes and other duties on goods led to a number of traders and consumers evading the extra price burden by using the county's ragged coastline as a landing point for dutiable goods. The most trafficked items were brandy, lace and tobacco, imported from Continental Europe. The Jamaica Inn pub on Bodmin Moor has been noted for its early association with smuggling. By the 19th century, a large proportion of the population of Cornwall ‚Äì an estimated 10,000 people, including women and children ‚Äì were thought to take part in the smuggling business. The rate of smuggling subsided in the coming century, and by the 1830s, two factors were established to have combined to make smuggling less worthwhile ‚Äì improvements in coastguard services which lead to capture, and the reduction of excise duties on imported goods. 20th and 21st centuries A revival of interest in Cornish studies began in the early 20th century with the work of Henry Jenner and the building of links with the other five Celtic nations. A political party, Mebyon Kernow, was formed in 1951 to attempt to serve the interests of Cornwall and to support greater self-government for the county. The party has had elected a number of members to county, district, town and parish councils but has had no national success, although the more widespread use of the Flag of St Piran has been accredited to this party. There have been some developments in the recognition of Cornish identity or ethnicity. In 2001 for the first time in the UK the inhabitants of Cornwall could record their ethnicity as Cornish on the national census, and in 2004 the schools census in Cornwall carried a Cornish option as a subdivision of white British. On 24 April 2014 it was announced that Cornish people will be granted minority status under the European Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities.

Thereby the East German government also accepted the division of K√ºstrin, Frankfurt (Oder), Guben and G√∂rlitz. This border drawing gave Poland a quarter of the Germany territory according to the borders of 1937, whose German-speaking population had been expelled in the wake of the German defeat. The treaty was worded as a declaration and was, initially, not recognised as a legitimate international treaty by West Germany insisting on its exclusive mandate and the members states of NATO. Four years later when the Soviet Union granted East Germany independence,Declaration of the Government of the U.S.S.R. Concerning the Granting of Sovereignty to the German Democratic Republic, 25 March, 1954 the Soviet Union reserved rights over East Germany (similar to the rights reserved by the Western Allies over West Germany under the Bonn‚ÄìParis conventions) pending a final peace treaty with Germany - the 1990 Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany. So although the treaty was binding on Poland and East Germany, for several decades it was not seen by many western members of the international community as such. The West German government continued to maintain that the status of the territories east of the Oder-Neisse line were \\"under Polish and Soviet administration\\" until in 1970 Chancellor Willy Brandt signed the Treaty of Warsaw, giving de facto acknowledgement of the border and confirming West Germany's acceptance of the Treaty of Zgorzelec as an international agreement binding on the states that were party to it. The validity of the Treaty of Zgorzelec was explicitly confirmed in a judgement of the Federal Constitutional Court of 1973 on the Basic Treaty between East and West Germany. Reunited Germany formally accepted the Oder-Neisse boundary in the German‚ÄìPolish Border Treaty (1990). The community centre in which the treaty was signed is one of Zgorzelec's main sights and is found in a park beside the road bridge border crossing.

Some old sources wrongly refer to a charter from 926 for land at Hope and Ashford as being ‚Äúin Derbyshire‚Äù but the original of the charter does not say Derbyshire, it just says Hope and Ashford. On the other hand, the later and final appearance of the Mercian Kingdoms' province of the Peak District occurs in a charter of King Edgar in 963, where land at Ballidon near Wirksworth is being granted. This charter refers to the land as being ‚Äúin pago Pecset‚Äù not \\"on Deorbyscire\\". Administrative change of the Mercian provinces is often attributed to King Edgar and if this were so then his charters would reflect it, but the Ballidon charter of 963 doesn't. Therefore, it is more likely that the shiring of Derbyshire and the dismemberment of the Pecsaete took place after 975 in the reign of Aethelred the Unready with the remainder of the Peak District being hived off to Nottinghamshire (two hundreds); Cheshire (one hundred) and Staffordshire (one, possibly two, hundreds), the remaining seven forming Derbyshire. Medieval and later Derbyshire Derbyshire was traditionally divided into Hundreds or Wapentakes (later), namely Appletree, High Peak, Morleyston and Litchurch, Repton and Gresley, Scarsdale, Wirksworth (whose hundred was also known as the Hamenstan Hundred early in its development). These were based on the seven earlier hundreds recorded in the Domesday Book, with a merging of Repton and Gresley taking place, among other gradual changes in the Hundred or Wapentake names. Derbyshire had a detached part in north-western Leicestershire, surrounding Measham and Donisthorpe. This escaped regularisation in 1844, and was incorporated into Leicestershire in 1888 when the county councils were set up. The thin strip of Leicestershire between the exclave and Derbyshire, containing Overseal and Netherseal, is now considered part of Derbyshire. Apart from this, some parishes in historic Derbyshire, including Dore, Norton and Totley, are now in the City of Sheffield in South Yorkshire, having formerly been in the Scarsdale Wapentake.

Rouse in 1939, was a publicly held shopping mall and community developer from 1956 until 2004, when General Growth Properties (GGP) purchased the company. Beginnings - Moss- Rouse Company The Moss-Rouse Company was founded as a FHA mortgage company with a loan from Hunter Moss's sister. Rouse leveraged his knowledge as loan guarantee specialist at the Federal Housing Administration to establish a Baltimore-based mortgage company specializing in FHA backed loans. Moss-Rouse hired a World War Two Navy friend, Churchill G. Carey from Connecticut General, who in turn provided capital for future projects. Carey would hold positions ranging from president to CEO of the mortgage company subsidiary. In 1952-1953 the company built one of the first modern architecture office buildings on Saratoga Street in Baltimore, while also dropping its commercial lending business line. Jim Rouse hired his brother, Willard Rouse II, in 1952, and partner, Hunter Moss, phased out of operations, selling his shares of the company, while remaining temporarily on the board of directors. The firm was renamed the James W. Rouse & Company, Inc., with Rouse owning 50% equity, his brother, Willard, 10%, and 40%, to company officers. The James W. Rouse Company The James W. Rouse Company built some of the first enclosed shopping malls, and it pioneered the development of festival marketplaces, such as Jacksonville Landing in Jacksonville, Faneuil Hall in Boston, South Street Seaport in New York City, Harborplace in Baltimore, and Bayside Marketplace in Miami. They also developed The Shops at National Place in downtown Washington, D.C. that opened in 1984‚Äì85. On 20 June 1966, The James W. Rouse Company was renamed as The Rouse Company. The company has been credited as the pioneer of the first successful food court in an enclosed shopping mall, when the food court at the Sherway Mall in Toronto opened in 1971. It followed an unsuccessful attempt at the Plymouth Meeting Mall in 1968, which reportedly failed because it was \\"deemed too small and insufficiently varied.\\" The company moved its headquarters to the Cross Keys development, then to the project at Columbia, Maryland in December 1969. Its community projects include the Village of Cross Keys in Baltimore and the planned cities of Columbia, Maryland (where it was headquartered), Bridgeland Community, Texas, and Summerlin, Nevada. To develop these projects, in 1962 Rouse brought on Bill Finley, who built a planned \\"company town\\", Ravenswood, West Virginia, was a former planner with the National Capital Planning Commission proposing planned cities, and was a proponent of public-private partnerships. Columbia Research and Development was founded as a public company and Howard Research and Development was formed as a Rouse subsidiary in 1956 to raise capital for four mall projects and later to facilitate the Columbia Project with Connecticut General and Chase Manhattan as stakeholder with interest deferred loans. In 1966 The James W Rouse Company was restructured as the Rouse Company, adding Howard Research and Development (HRD) as a separate entity shielded Rouse Corporation from debt liability of the Columbia development. HRD lost money, with new rules affecting the parent company as well. In 1974, HRD was refinanced. Columbia Development Corporation was formed a subsidiary of HRD using subcontracted Rouse Company employees. In 1985 CIGNA (Connecticut General) divested its interest in HRD and the project back to Rouse for $120 million at a net loss. Rouse created the subsidiary company The American City Corporation to take advantage of the National Urban Policy and New Community Development Act of 1970, A HUD program which granted developers incentives and loans to build Title VII \\"New Towns\\" with mandatory percentages of low income housing projects. Rouse's former ACTION member, Leo Molinaro was selected to run the subdivision. The symposiums held by the company gathered together investors like George Mitchell, who would go on to develop Woodlands, Texas using the Columbia model. The subsidiary was based at \\"Two Wincopin\\" in the second office building in built in Columbia in 1968. It was renamed to the American City Building using the subsidiary to lease the empty space and develop the system of Public-Private partnerships that Rouse would use worldwide to minimize risk in developments using public debt. The business was given its own postal office, the American Cities Station in 1977. The Columbia development was marketed as a progressive community for all races. In 1971, the company responded to pressure from the NAACP that the company was absent of African Americans at all management levels and its businesses in Columbia were predominantly white owned. The company responded with an affirmative action program in November 1971. In 1973, the former assistant attorney general of Maryland, Mathias J. DeVito, left the Rouse-owned legal firm of DLA Piper to replace James W. Rouse as President of the Rouse Company, and Rouse became Chairman. DeVito cut staff from 1,700 to 500 to keep the company afloat in 1975. In 1974, the Columbia development got a political boost as the population of Columbia supported a slate of at-large council candidates with Columbia interests, including Ruth U. Keeton, Lloyd Knowles, and Columbia's city manager, Richard L. Anderson. In 1979, Simon H. Schuer acquired a 7.5% interest in the Rouse Company. He was the creator of \\"The Shrink\\", a method where an investor buys an interest in a company, then orders stock buy-backs to make the interest more valuable. Schuer died the day after the purchase, and Trizec Properties then acquired the shares and bought a 25% stake. In 1986, the company attempted to purchase a majority share. In 1985, The Rouse Company absorbed all of Connecticut General's interests in the Howard Research and Development subsidiary. In 1986, former general manager of Columbia and executive vice president of development Micheal Spear became president as a successor to Rouse. In 1990, Spear died in a crash with his wife and one daughter in his Piper PA-31T Cheyenne attempting a single engine missed approach near Logan International Airport. In 1997, Anthony Deering took over as CEO of the company. In 1996, Howard Hughes Corporation, which had extensive property and other business interests, became a subsidiary. On November 12, 2004, the Rouse Company was sold to General Growth Properties. In 2012, General Growth Properties spun off 30 malls into a new real estate investment trust, Rouse Properties.

It has a population of 20,630 inhabitants. The landmark of the city is the fact that it was the principal religious and cultural center of the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church in Transylvania. History Blaj is first mentioned in 1271 as Villa Herbordi, after the deed of a Count Herbod. In 1313, the domain passed to Herbod's son Blasius Cserei and the town was mentioned as Blasii. Started as a hamlet for the twenty families of servants of the noble's court, it was awarded town status on May 19, 1737. Blaj is the principal religious and cultural center of Greek Catholics in Transylvania. At 27 October 1687 begins the history of the Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic, history directly connected to the history of the town Blaj. It all started at the end of the treaty through which Transylvania was entering under the protection of Austria, renouncing the protection of the Turkish Empire. The first public school in Romanian was established in Blaj in 1754. Blaj was the first place to have Romanian written with Latin alphabet instead of Cyrillic in which it had traditionally been written. Blaj was also a center for the Romanian Age of Enlightenment, being the founding site of the Transylvanian School that promoted the Roman cultural heritage of the Romanians. Thus Blaj gained the nickname \\"The Little Rome\\", as Romania's national poet Mihai Eminescu called it. In 1848, C√¢mpia LibertƒÉ»õii in Blaj was where over 40,000 Romanians met to protest Transylvania becoming a part of Hungary, holding that the lands would be stolen from them. Geography Blaj lies at the confluence of the two T√¢rnava Rivers, in a wine-growing region. The city has a continental temperate climate, characteristic for the Transylvanian Plateau, with moderate precipitations of around 550 mm/m2.

There is evidence of occupation in the county from Stone Age times onward. Its recorded history starts in the Roman period when it was a civitas. It was then a separate kingdom for a number of centuries until it was incorporated into early England. It has remained a largely agriculture based region ever since though tourism is now very important. Prehistory Devon was one of the first areas of Great Britain settled following the end of the last ice age. Kents Cavern in Torbay is one of the earliest places in England known to have been occupied by modern man. Dartmoor is thought to have been settled by Mesolithic hunter- gatherer peoples from about 6000 BC, and they later cleared much of the oak forest, which regenerated as moor. In the Neolithic era, from about 3500 BC, there is evidence of farming on the moor, and also building and the erection of monuments, using the large granite boulders that are ready to hand there; Dartmoor contains the remains of the oldest known buildings in England. There are over 500 known Neolithic sites on the moor, in the form of burial mounds, stone rows, stone circles and ancient settlements such as the one at Grimspound. Stone rows are a particularly striking feature, ranging in length from a few metres to over 3 km. Their ends are often marked by a cairn, a stone circle, or a standing stone (see menhir). Because most of Dartmoor was not ploughed during the historic period, the archaeological record is relatively easy to trace. The name \\"Devon\\" derives from the tribe of Celtic people who inhabited the south-western peninsula of Britain at the time of the Roman invasion in 43 AD, the Dumnonii - possibly meaning 'Deep Valley Dwellers' (Cornish: Dewnans, Welsh: Dyfnaint, Breton: Devnent) or 'Worshippers of the god Dumnonos'. This tribal name carried on into the Roman and post- Roman periods. The Dumnonii did not mint coins, unlike their neighbours to the east the Durotriges, but coins of the Dobunni have been found in the area. Early trading ports are known to have existed at Mount Batten (Plymouth)Barry Cunliffe : Mount Batten Plymouth: A Prehistoric and Roman Port. Oxford University Press 1988 and at Bantham where ancient tin ingots were found in 1991-92 according with classical reports of tin trading with the Mediterranean The Archaeology of Mining & Metallurgy in Southwest BritainAillen Fox, 1996. Roman period Devon was not as Romanised as Somerset and Dorset, with evidence of occupation limited mainly to the area around Exeter where the Roman walls can still be seen. It is likely a settlement at Exeter of some sort pre-existed the Romans and that the local Brythonic tribe inhabiting the area, the Dumnonii, maintained a tradition of independence. It appears that initially the Dumnonii tribe of Britons were a client kingdom of Rome, but from about AD 55 the Romans held at least part of the area under military occupation, maintaining a naval port at Topsham and a garrison of the 2nd Augustan Legion at Exeter, which they called 'Isca'. This banked and palisaded fortress contained mostly barracks and workshops, but also a magnificent bath- house and was occupied for approximately twenty years. Then the legion moved to Caerleon and the civilians of the surrounding settlement took control. All the associated trappings of local government followed, such as a forum and basilica and, eventually a stone city wall. The Roman administration stayed here for over three centuries. There were several smaller forts across the county and a number of pagan shrines, as remembered in the name of the Nymet villages (Nemeton), but the lands west of the Exe remained largely un- Romanized. The higher status locals there often lived in banked homesteads known as 'Rounds', while East Devon had a number of luxurious villas, such as that discovered at Holcombe, as well as Roman roads of the sophisticated cobbled type. Post Roman Independence After the end of Roman rule in Britain in about 410, the kingdom of Dumnonia emerged covering Devon, Cornwall and Somerset, based on the former Roman civitas and named after the pre-Roman Dumnonii. Gildas castigated King Constantine, who was probably a second generation ruler of Dumnonia in the early sixth century. The Roman episcopal structure survived, and shortly before 705 Aldhelm, abbot of Malmesbury, wrote a letter to King Geraint of Dumnonia and his bishops. Exeter, known as ‚ÄúCaer Uisc‚Äù, may have been central to the kingdom but some historians and antiquaries have speculated that the Kings of Dumnonia may have been itinerant with no fixed capital and moved their court from place to place. The Welsh Triads name Celliwig in Cornwall as a possible site of a royal court, another is High Peak close to Sidmouth. The former Roman city of Exeter may have become an ecclesiastical centre, as evidenced by a sub-Roman cemetery discovered near the cathedral. The Brythonic cemetery in Exeter may have been attached to the monastery attended by the young Wilfred St. Boniface (said to be a native of Crediton) in the late 7th century. However its Abbot had a purely Saxon name, suggesting it was an Anglo-Saxon foundation.  Anglo-Saxon conquest of Dumnonia  The date that the Anglo-Saxons began to settle in Devon is not certain. Raids westwards from the core territories of Wessex seem to have been set in motion about 660. After a battle fought probably at Penselwood in 658 the West Saxons advanced to the River Parrett and by 682 they had reached the Quantocks and were pressing forward into the coastal plain.H. R.

The end of the fighting appears to have been a protracted and miserable affair. Campaigns by King Ecgberht of Wessex in Devon between 813 and 822 appear to have resulted in the defeat of the West Welsh in Cornwall but not their complete disposition. William of Malmesbury reports negotiations between King Alfred of Wessex and King Dungarth of the Cornish in c. 876 held somewhere near Exmoor in Devon; presumably Alfred would have sought reassurances over his western frontier as he conspired to defeat the Danes.Major, Albany (1913) Early Wars of Wessex, pp. 97. Blandford Press. . It seems most likely that the final acts of conquest of Devon by Wessex came under King √Üthelstan of the English. William of Malmesbury claimed that \\"the Britons and Saxons inhabited Exeter aequo jure\\" - \\"as equals\\". However √Üthelstan notably expelled ‚Äúthat filthy race‚Äù from Exeter in 927.Payton, Philip (1996) Cornwall. Fowey: Alexander Associates Some sources, notably the Cornish antiquary William Borlase, state that the expulsion of the Britons from Exeter was the first act in a military campaign against the West Welsh led by √Üthelstan. William Borlase says there was a battle against King Howel of the West Welsh at Haldon near Teignmouth in 936 where the West Welsh were soundly defeated. It seems they were then pursued westwards across the River Tamar and through Cornwall where they were defeated again close to Land's End in what may have been a ‚Äúlast-ditch‚Äù encounter that probably ended in slaughter, thus rendering the statement made centuries earlier and known to us as The Groan of the Britons seem morbidly appropriate; \\"The barbarians drive us to the sea, the sea drives us to the barbarians, between these two means of death we are either killed or drowned\\". An inflamed and astonished Welsh reaction to these events is found in the contemporary poem, Armes Prydein, where the last independent king of Cornwall, reputedly King Howel, was said to lament: > \\"Sorrow springs from a world upturned.\\"Wood, Michael (1981) In Search of the > Dark Ages, p.135. BBC Books. . The Britons (West Welsh, Cornishmen) certainly survived in Devon beyond this date because they apparently re-entered Exeter at a later date and an area was known as \\"Brittayne\\" in the south west quarter of the city until the 18th century. The Celtic language is reputed to have survived in parts of Devon until the Middle Ages, in particular the South Hams, according to Risdon and Carew. Evidence for the Anglo-Saxon genetic influence on Devon has been found in UK wide genetic studies by the Wellcome Trust, University of Oxford & University College London. They discovered that Devon is markedly distinct from Cornwall, and that although Devon was also distinct from the rest of Southern England, it was less so than Cornwall. Oxford University researcher, Sir Walter Bodmer, said this could likely be explained by the Anglo-Saxons contributing less DNA to the gene pool in Cornwall than in Devon. It is notable that these distinct genetic groups closely match the traditional county boundaries, both between Cornwall and Devon but also between Devon and it's eastern neighbours. . Devon in Anglo Saxon times A Map of British Kingdoms circa 800 AD By the 9th century, the major threat to peace in Devon came from Viking raiders. To confound them, Alfred the Great refortified Exeter as a defensive burh, followed by new erections at Lydford, Halwell and Pilton, although these fortifications were relatively small compared to burhs further east, suggesting these were protection for only the elite. Edward the Elder built similarly at Barnstaple and Totnes. The English defeated a combined Cornish and Danish force at Callington in 832. Sporadic Viking incursions continued, however, until the Norman Conquest, including the disastrous defeat of the Devonians at the Battle of Pinhoe in 1001. A few Norse placenames remain as a result, for example Lundy Island. The men of Devon are said by Asser to have fought the Danes at the battle of the Battle of Cynwit in 878, which may have been at Kenwith Castle or Countisbury, although Cannington in Somerset is also claimed as the site of the battle. In 894, the Danes attempted to besiege Exeter but were driven off by King Alfred but it was sacked in 1001. Devon formed part of the bishopric of Sherborne (Dorset) after this was set up in 705 AD. In the early 10th century, King Athelstan refounded the monastery at Exeter. Roman Catholicism gradually took over from Celtic Christianity as minster churches were established across the county. Devon was given its own bishopric in 905, initially at Bishop's Tawton, though it quickly moved to Crediton. As part of the general move towards urban cathedrals in the late Saxon period, Bishop Leofric eventually transferred his see to the old abbey at Exeter in 1050. The boundary between Devon and Cornwall was fixed as the east bank of the River Tamar by King Athelstan of Wessex in 928. Norman and medieval period Immediately after the Norman Conquest, William the Conqueror recognised the importance of securing the loyalty of the West Country and thus the need to secure Exeter. The city managed to withstand an eighteen-day siegePalliser, David Michael; Clark, Peter; and Daunton, Martin J. (2000). The Cambridge Urban History of Britain, p. 595. Cambridge University Press. . and the new king was only eventually allowed to enter upon honourable terms. The many great estates subsequently held by William's barons in Devon were known as \\"honours\\". Chief amongst them were Plympton, Okehampton, Barnstaple, Totnes and Harberton. In the 12th century, the honour of Plympton, along with the Earldom of Devon, was given to the Redvers family. In the following century, it passed to the Courtenays, who had already acquired Okehampton, and, in 1335, they received the earldom too. It was also in the 14th century that the Dukedom of Exeter was bestowed on the Holland family, but they became extinct in the reign of Edward IV. The ancestors of Sir Walter Raleigh, who was born at East Budleigh, held considerable estates in the county from a similar period. Devon was given an independent sheriff. Originally an hereditary appointment, this was later held for a year only. In 1320, the locals complained that all the hundreds of Devon were under the control of the great lords who did not appoint sufficient bailiffs for their proper government. During the civil war of King Stephen‚Äôs reign, the castles of Plympton and Exeter were held against the king by Baldwin de Redvers in 1140. Conflict resurfaced in the 14th and 15th centuries, when the French made frequent raids on the Devon coast and, during the Wars of the Roses, when frequent skirmishes took place between the Lancastrian Earl of Devon and Yorkist Lord Bonville. In 1470, Edward IV pursued Warwick and Clarence as far as Exeter after the Battle of Lose-coat Field. Warwick eventually escaped to France via Dartmouth. Later, Richard III travelled to Exeter to personally punish those who had inflamed the West against him. Several hundred were outlawed, including the Bishop and the Dean. Dartmoor and Exmoor (mainly in Somerset) were Royal Forests, i.e. hunting preserves. The men of Devon paid 5000 marks to have these deforested in 1242. The 11th to 14th centuries were a period of economic and population growth, but the Black Death in 1348 and subsequent years caused decline in both with resulting social change; many villages and hamlets such as 12th century Hound Tor were said to have been deserted whilst new settlements were later granted to the rising class of tenant farmers exemplified by the surviving 14th century Dartmoor longhouse settlement at Higher Uppacott such that peasant farmers subsequently prospered with large flocks of sheep and cattle. Towns such as Totnes were particularly noted for their wealth owing to the wool and tin trade with the Continent in this period. Tudor and Stuart period Maps of territory held by Royalists (red) and Parliamentarians (yellow), 1642 ‚Äî 1645 Early in Henry VII's reign, the royal pretender, Perkin Warbeck, besieged Exeter in 1497. The King himself came down to judge the prisoners and to thank the citizens for their loyal resistance. Great disturbances throughout the county followed the introduction of Edward VI's Book of Common Prayer. The day after Whit Sunday 1549, a priest at Sampford Courtenay was persuaded to read the old mass.Heal, Felicity (2003). Reformation in Britain and Ireland, p. 225. Oxford University Press. . This insubordination spread swiftly into serious revolt. The Cornish quickly joined the men of Devon in the Prayer Book Rebellion and Exeter suffered a distressing siege until relieved by Lord Russell.Secor, Philip Bruce (1999). Richard Hooker: Prophet of Anglicanism, p. 13. Continuum International Publishing Group. . Devon is particularly known for its Elizabethan mariners, such as Sir Francis Drake, Mayor of Plymouth, Gilbert, Sir Richard Grenville and Sir Walter Raleigh. Plymouth Hoe is famous as the location where Drake continued to play bowls after hearing that the Spanish Armada had been sighted. Plymouth was also the final departure point for the Mayflower in 1620, although the settlers themselves were mainly drawn from England. During the Civil War, the cities of Devon largely favoured the Parliamentarian cause, and by and large the rural areas favoured the Royalists. but there was a great desire for peace in the region and, in 1643 a treaty for the cessation of hostilities in Devon and Cornwall was agreed. Only small-scale skirmishes continued until the capture of Dartmouth and Exeter in 1646 by Sir Thomas Fairfax. He then captured Tiverton and defeated Lord Hopeton's army at Torrington. The last place held for the king was Charles Fort at Salcombe. After the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685, Judge Jefferies held one of his ‚Äòbloody assizes‚Äô at Exeter. In 1688, the Prince of Orange first landed in England at Brixham (where his statue stands in the town harbour) to launch the Glorious Revolution and his journey to London to claim the English throne as William III. He was entertained for several days at both Forde and at Exeter. Modern period In the modern period, after 1650, the City of Plymouth has had a large growth becoming the largest city in Devon, mainly due to the naval base at Devonport on its west. Plymouth played an important role as a naval port in both World War I and World War II. South Devon was a training and assembly area during World War II for the D-Day landings and there is a memorial to the many soldiers who were killed during a rehearsal off Slapton Sands. Both Plymouth and Exeter suffered badly from bombing during the war and the centre of Exeter and vast swathes of Plymouth had to be largely rebuilt during the 1960s. Cold winters were a feature of the 17th century, that of 1676 being particularly hard. Smallpox epidemics occurred in the 1640s, 1710s and 1760s, resulting in many deaths. In October 1690 there was an earthquake in Barnstaple. Daniel Defoe published an account of a tour through Devon in 1724 and 1727. South Devon impressed him but be thought that north Devon was wild, barren and poor. During the Napoleonic War a prison was built at Princetown on Dartmoor to hold French and American prisoners of war. This prison is still in use. In 1842 the population was said to be mainly employed in agriculture. The population declined in the 19th century but has subsequently increased due to the favourable climate and the arrival of the railways. In the 19th and 20th centuries. Devon has experienced great changes, including the rise of the tourist industry on the so-called English Riviera, decline of farming and fishing, urbanisation, and also proliferation of holiday homes in for example Salcombe. Devon has become famous for its clotted cream and cider. Dartmoor has become a National Park, as has Exmoor. Devon has suffered many severe storms, including one that largely swept away Hallsands in 1917. Politically Devon has had a tendency to lean towards the Conservative and Liberal/Liberal-Democrat parties. Mining history Devon has produced tin, copper and other metals from ancient times. Until about 1300 it produced more than Cornwall but production declined with the opening of the deep Cornish mines. Tin was found largely on Dartmoor's granite heights, and copper in the areas around it. It was exported from Mount Batten in prehistoric times. The Dartmoor tin-mining industry thrived for hundreds of years, continuing from pre-Roman times right through to the first half of the 20th century. In the eighteenth century Devon Great Consols mine (near Tavistock) was believed to be the largest copper mine in the world. Devon's tin miners enjoyed a substantial degree of independence through Devon's stannary parliament, which dates back to the twelfth century. Stannary authority exceeded English law, and because this authority applied to part-time miners (e.g. tin streamers) as well as full-time miners the stannary parliament had significant power. Until the early 18th century the stannary parliament met in an open air parliament at Crockern Tor on Dartmoor with stannators appointed to it from each of the four stannary towns. The parliament maintained its own gaol at Lydford and had a brutal and 'bloody' reputation (indeed Lydford law became a byword for injustice), and once even gaoled an English MP in the reign of Henry VIII.

A communist from an early age, he wrote many poems and songs in praise of the Soviet Union, but his most famous song is doubtless the rather apolitical Katyusha. Biography Mikhail Isakovsky was born in the village of Glotovka, Yelninsky Uyezd, Smolensk Governorate, to a poor peasant family of ethnic Russians. A local priest taught him to read and write.

Slayage, v. 24. It has since been used to describe annual villains in other television series, and has also been used in scholarly work discussing Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  On Buffy the Vampire Slayer  The term \\"Big Bad\\" was originally used on American television program Buffy the Vampire Slayer (which aired 1997‚Äì2003). According to author Kevin Durand (2009), \\"While Buffy confronts various forms of evil during each episode, each season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer had its own 'big bad' villain who dominates throughout the season. The power of the 'big bad' always threatens to end the world, but Buffy ultimately overcomes him or her in the season finale.\\" The series balanced its episodic stories with advancing that season's big bad story arc. The term was originally used in the episode \\"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered\\", in which Buffy Summers describes the newly soulless Angel as \\"the big, bad thing in the dark\\". The prior episode, \\"Phases\\", has Xander Harris \\"being\\" the werewolf and saying, \\"I'm the big, bad wolf.\\" The phrase may originate in various fairy tales (particularly \\"Three Little Pigs\\" and the related song) about the \\"Big Bad Wolf\\". The phrase \\"big bad\\" by itself as a noun was first used on screen in Season 3, in the episode \\"Gingerbread\\" where Buffy says that an occult symbol is harmless, \\"not a big bad\\". Slang generation was encouraged in the writers' room. Marti Noxon, writer and eventually showrunner, said that \\"Big Bad\\" was used \\"long before the characters themselves started using the phrase\\". Using \\"big bad\\" as a noun instead of using as an adjective is a functional shift, which was done often on the show. The first \\"Big Bad\\" villain on the program was The Master, played by Mark Metcalf. According to author Jan Jagodzinski, the battle between Buffy and the evil Master is \\"the central issue of season one\\"; The Master, like all the \\"big bads\\", is a \\"symptom of postmodernity\\". David Sims of The Atlantic wrote that Joss Whedon, creator of the series, made the model for the Golden Age of television:  On other television series  The use of Big Bads has become common in TV science fiction and fantasy series, especially with more binge-watching of serialized shows. In the Arrowverse, after 8 years and 20 collective seasons, the series Arrow, The Flash, Supergirl and Legends of Tomorrow had 22 Big Bads, which TVLine ranked based on \\"Compelling Backstory, Fearsome Appearance, Powers/Skills, Utter Ruthlessness, Eeeevilness of Agenda, Despicable Damage Done\\". But Den of Geek's Dave Golder questioned the continued use of the \\"season-long baddie\\" plot device. The Doctor Who revival has occasionally used Big Bads. Jef Rouner of the Houston Press wrote how Doctor Who series 6 succeed with the \\"proper format,\\" beginning with a new villain to the series, the Silence. He also wrote that for series 11, \\"The main villain is regular old human cruelty and apathy to suffering\\", adding this had some similarity to Buffy the Vampire Slayer season 6's Big Bad, ‚Äúlife.‚Äù But Lacy Baugher wrote on Syfy Wire that the show can have the smaller personal, emotional stories, and doesn't need the \\"big, sweeping arcs and grand monsters\\". \\"Each Big Bad the Doctor faced had to be the most dangerous in the universe.\\"  See also  *Boss (video gaming)  References   Further reading  *  External links  * The Buffy Formula: Patterns in the Buffyverse on SpoilerSlayer.com * Opposing Buffy: Power, Responsibility and the Narrative Function of the Big Bad in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Master of Arts Thesis by Joseph Lipsett Category:Buffyverse Category:Supervillains ","title":"Big Bad"},{"id":"1139461","text":"Young Judaea is a peer-led Zionist youth movement that runs programs throughout the United States for Jewish youth in grades 2‚Äì12. In Hebrew, Young Judaea is called Yehuda Hatzair (◊ô◊î◊ï◊ì◊î ◊î◊¶◊¢◊ô◊®) or is sometimes referred to as Hashachar (◊î◊©◊ó◊®), lit. \\"the dawn\\". Founded in 1909, it is the oldest Zionist youth movement in the United States. History and organization Founded in 1909, Young Judaea is a peer-led youth movement. Its programs include youth clubs, conventions, camps and Israel programs with an emphasis on social action and Jewish identity. Young Judaea has 15 regions in the United States and is affiliated with the Federation of Zionist Youth (United Kingdom) and Tzofim (Israel). The age levels are Ofarim (Hebrew for \\"fawns;\\" grades 2‚Äì5), Tsofim (\\"scouts,\\" grades 6‚Äì7), and Bogrim (\\"elders,\\" grades 8‚Äì12). Young Judaea's university arm was formerly called HaMagshimim, meaning \\"the fulfillers\\"), now college programs focus primarily on volunteering and interning in Israel as well as Birthright trips. In 1967, Hadassah became the sponsor of Young Judaea. This relationship continued until 2011, when it was announced that Hadassah would no longer sponsor Young Judaea. This change formally occurred on July 2, 2012. Principles All Young Judaea programs are centered around the movement's ideology. The charter of the organization, officially titled \\"Yehudah Hatzair Leumi Chukah,\\" outlines the ideology and goals of the organization. Its main points include: * Young Judaea is a politically non-partisan and religiously pluralistic organization. * Young Judaea is a Zionist youth movement, recognizes the State of Israel as a central part of Jewish life and encourages visiting Israel. * As a Jewish youth movement, Young Judaea stresses Jewish values, Jewish education, and the preservation of the identity of the Jewish people. * Social action is a part of both our Jewish and Zionist identities and as such Young Judaea works to help Jews and others in need both local and worldwide. * A cohesive community can be built regardless of religious and political affiliations. Leadership Young Judaea is a peer run organization with mazkiriyot (boards) of peer leaders on local, regional, and national levels. The National Mazkirut is elected at Young Judaea's National Midwinter Convention by a convention body consisting of Bogrim (9th-12th grade members of the movement). The National Mazkirut serves for a one-year period. The regional Mazkirut level varies throughout the country. Most regions contain at least five of the positions listed below. The local, or club level also works differently throughout the country as there are many different clubs of different sizes, and often club Mazkirut members fill multiple positions. Clubs will often have an adult advisor. =Young Judaea leadership positions= * Mazkir or Mazkira (literally: secretary) This position is president of the Mazkirut. * Merakez/et Irgun (literally: organizational coordinator) This position is the Administrative Vice President (AVP) of the Mazkirut. Responsibilities include finances, membership, and logistics for the national level and overseeing the regional AVPs, along with acting as general Vice President to the Mazkir. * Merakzei Chinuch (literally: educational coordinators) These positions create educational programming for each of the different age groups. Prior to the mid-1990s there was one national coordinator for all of the age groups. These positions exist on both a national and regional levels with the national level coordinators assisting the regional ones. ** Bogrim. This position creates curriculum and activities for the Bogrim (8th‚Äì12th grade) age group. Responsibilities include programming for the Bogrim National Midwinter Convention and National Summer Convention. ** Ofarim/Tsofim. This position creates curriculum and activities for the Ofarim and Tsofim (2nd‚Äì7th grade) age group. Responsibilities include programming, encouraging members to attend Ofarim/Tsofim regional summer camps and encouraging continuing participation in Young Judea after finishing the Ofarim/Tsofim age level. * Merakez/et Tikkun Olam Social Action Programmer (SAP). This position develops social action events and ensures that tikkun olam values are built into all programs at the national level and regional levels. Their educational focus is defined by tikkun groups‚Äîdifferent social action groups formed that are focused on five different issues (threats to Israel, pikuach nefesh, environmentalism, human rights, and poverty). They also manage volunteer opportunities for participants. * Pirsumim (literally: \\"advertising\\") This position is responsible for publishing newsletters, informational documents and advertisements for the movement. This includes the national online newsletter (Kol Ha'Tnua; literally \\"voice of the movement), event promotion, web pages, and press releases. * Merakez/et Havurah Metahnenet (Russian Programming Coordinator) This position plays the role of coordinating events and programming in relations to Machaneh Tel Yehudah‚Äôs Havurah Program. Machaneh Tel Yehudah‚Äôs Havurah program is a part of Young Judaea to inspire Russian- speaking Jews to strengthen their identity, culture, and heritage in a unique community. S/he must engage the Russian-Jewish community to influence their self-identity. * As of 2019-2020, the National Mazkirut is still very active in running this peer-led youth movement. *The positions are held by: **Eitan Weinkle - Mazkir (President) ** Hannah Slavsky - Merakezet Irgun (Administrative Vice President) **Jessica Siegel - Merakezet Chinuch l'Bogrim (High School Programmer) **Nikki Lerner - Merakezet Chinuch l'Offarim/Tsofim (Elementary/Middle School Programmer) **Sara Saidel - Merakezet Tikkun Olam (Social Action Programmer) **Gabby Rub - Pirsumim (Publicity) *The positions for the 2020-2021 term will be held by: **Allegra Wertheim - Mazkira (President) **Max Canning - Merakez Irgun (Administrative Vice President) **Manni Burach - Merakezet Chinuch l'Bogrim (High School Programmer) **Julia Cooper - Merakezet Chinuch l'Offarim/Tsofim (Elementary/Middle School Programmer) **Massimo Bertini - Merakez Tikkun Olam (Social Action Programmer) **Sivan Ornstein-Luks - Pirsumim (Publicity) Merchavim and regions Young Judaea is divided into five units, called Merchavim (the singular: Merchav), which are titled according to their geographical location in the United States (including Puerto Rico). The Merchavim are subdivided into geographical regions. Each region is composed of clubs. Until the mid-1970s, the regions were referred to using English language names. Currently the regions are referred to using Hebrew language names. The five Mechavim are: The Southeast Merchav (known colloquially as \\"Boom Boom\\") contains G'lil Yam (North Carolina, minus Hendersonville and Asheville, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and the District of Columbia), Or Hadarom (Florida minus the Panhandle and Puerto Rico), and Lev Hadarom (Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee. South Carolina, Arkansas, eastern Louisiana, the Florida Panhandle, and western North Carolina) The Southwest Merchav is a single region, Ookaf Hadarom (Texas, Oklahoma and western Louisiana) The West Merchav contains Chagurat Hashemesh (Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and Montana), Ruach Hama'arav (Nevada and California), and Yoreh (Washington state, Oregon and Idaho) The Midwest Merchav is composed of Pneinu Artza (the Great Plains ‚Äì North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Indiana), Ayelet Hashachar (the central states ‚Äì Michigan, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky), and Ruach B'Tzion (western Pennsylvania, abbreviated WPA) The Northeast Merchav contains Ya'ar Penn (eastern Pennsylvania, abbreviated \\"EPA\\"), Empiria (English: Empire ‚Äì New York state, excluding Long Island and New York City, and Fairfield County, Connecticut), Ganei Yehudah (New Jersey), Eeyey Tsiyon (Long Island/New York City abbreviated \\"LINYC\\" or \\"LI/NYC\\"), and Uri Tsafon (New England ‚Äì Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, excluding Fairfield County) Programs =Conventions= Conventions are central to the Young Judaea experience. They fall into two categories: Merchav/Regional, and National. Merchav/Regional Conventions are organized by the local Regional/Merchav Mazkirut, there are two a year and are held in late fall/early winter and spring. During these conventions, regional Mazkirut are elected. Typical convention programming features educational workshops called sadnaot, educational activities called peulot, prayers, and plenty of chofesh (free time) for socializing. The National Midwinter convention takes place every year during Presidents' Day weekend. National Summer Convention is held in mid-August at Camp Tel Yehudah. Both of these conventions are open to any member of the movement in 9th through 12th grade. At the Midwinter Convention the movement elects a new National Mazkirut and makes amendments to the Chukah (the movement's constitution). At the Summer Convention, the newly elected members of the National Mazkirut are sworn in and changes are made to the Chukah. =Summer camps= Like many other youth movements, YJ operates summer camps for its members. Ofarim and Tsofim can attend one of four regional camps: * Camp Young Judaea Midwest in Waupaca, Wisconsin * Camp Young Judaea Texas in Wimberley, Texas * Camp Young Judaea Sprout Lake in Verbank, New York * Camp Judaea in Hendersonville, North Carolina Bogrim (high schoolers) attend Camp Tel Yehudah, the national teen leadership Camp in Barryville, New York. Programs there include Alumim (Jewish/Israeli history and development of a Jewish Identity for entering 9th graders), Yachad (community building for entering 10th graders), Hadracha (leadership and activism for entering 11th graders), and Alternative Summer Break (an immersive community service program open to rising 10th‚Äì12th graders). Tel Yehudah has two sessions that are each three and a half weeks long. The Alumim age group includes two days of hiking, one day of rafting on the Delaware River, and a one-day trip to a big city (often either Philadelphia or New York City). The Yachad age group includes the choice of a four-day kayaking, hiking, biking, photography or volunteering trip in Manhattan. The Hadracha age group goes to Washington, D.C. for four days on \\"Day on the Hill\\" to meet with national leaders and representatives and discuss specific modern day issues, as well as national advocacy organizations. =Israel programs= As a Zionist movement, Israel trips are a crucial part of the Young Judaea experience. Youth entering 11th‚Äì12th grade can spend several weeks in Israel through Machon or Israel Discovery. Both programs include a Special Interest Week, for example a desert trek, a stay on a kibbutz or training with the Israeli army. Recent high school graduates can also apply to spend 9 months on the Young Judaea Year Course in Israel program. Young Judaeans participating in Young Judaea Year Course are often able to transfer credits received on Year Course to their college. The basic Year Course program is broken up into sections with participants spending four months living in Jerusalem, four months living in the coastal town of Bat Yam with the option to spend two of those months participating in Marva, volunteering, or living in a youth village, and finally one month exploring special interests around the country. Young Judaea Year Course differentiates itself from most other movement freshman year abroad programs by immersing participants in Israeli life. Participants are encouraged to become part of Israeli society for their year in Israel. There are also many specialty tracks catering to participants' hobbies or interests. A few examples include Sports, Medical, Arts, Business, and Activism. Also available are religious-centered tracks (Shevet and Shalem) and travel-intensive tracks (Olami). Young Judaea alumni founded Kibbutz Ketura together with members of the Israeli scouts in 1973. =Social activism= Young Judaea has been active in social action projects including involvement in bringing constituencies to Darfur rallies and raising funds for victims of Hurricane Katrina. Young Judaea has raised nearly $30,000 for various causes, including Hadassah Hospital, the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies, and Latet, all in Israel. In the fall of 2005, after Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast, Young Judaea embarked on a program called Caravan 4 Katrina. The \\"Caravan\\" consisted of four truckloads (two from the Northeastern U.S. and two from the Southeastern U.S.) of food, toys, and clothes were collected and delivered to Katrina victims in Jackson, Mississippi in time for Thanksgiving. Another activism program Young Judaea leads is an annual Alternative Winter Break. Starting in 2007, participants traveled to different regions of the United States to perform community service and learn about the culture of the region. Previous trips have included New Orleans LA; Navajo Nation AZ; New York City, NY; Los Angeles, CA; Southern Florida; and Puerto Rico. Songs Singing is a large part of Young Judaea camps around America. The official song of Young Judaea is Ani v'Ata by Arik Einstein. Many songs sung in Young Judaea can be found in the Young Judaea shiron (song book). Alumni A number of Young Judaea alumni groups have been established. There is an online Young Judaea alumni blog, the Chorsha. Notable alumni who have been honored by Young Judaea at its annual gala are Seth Merrin, Anne Heyman, the Merrin Family, Jennifer Sylvor, Steve Greenberg, Alon Tal, David Rosenblatt, David Ruderman and Sharon Schoenfeld. Each of these honorees are recognized for their work on behalf of Young Judaea and their impact on our world in the spirit of tikuun olam - repairing the world. They stand for their strong values and lifelong commitment to Young Judaea. They make us proud and blaze the path for future Young Judaeans to make positive contributions to our world and Israel. Four alumni from the camp in Sprout Lake -- MLB.com reporter Jonathan Mayo, Daniel Miller, Jeremy Newberger, and Seth Kramer, of Ironbound Films -- were the producers of Heading Home: The Tale of Team Israel, a 2018 award-winning documentary film about the Israel national baseball team competing for the first time in the World Baseball Classic.Jonathan Mayo (February 1, 2017). \\"Cementing Israel‚Äôs ties to America‚Äôs pastime,\\" The Pittsburgh Jewish Chronicle.

In 2018, Bloomberg positioned Short Hills at fifth in the country in its 100 Richest places ranking, with an average household income of $354,479.. Accessed May 15, 2018.  History  = Beginnings = Originally, the area that would become Short Hills was part of Springfield Township, Union County, New Jersey, and its eponymous hills are thought to have played a role in the movement of the Continental Army under George Washington during the Battle of Springfield. While troops may have been present in the area, the Battle of Short Hills (June 26, 1777) took place in Scotch Plains and Metuchen New Jersey. Short Hills began as a planned community, when Stewart Hartshorn (who became wealthy from developing, perfecting and manufacturing the self-acting shade roller) purchased of land in Millburn Township, near the present Hobart Avenue, Parsonage Hill Road, and Chatham Road. Hartshorn's purpose was to create \\"a harmonious community for people who appreciated nature,\\" and \\"where natural beauty would not be destroyed by real estate developments, and where people of congenial tastes could dwell together.\\" He later increased his land holdings to for himself and for the whole village, with each plot not owned by Hartshorn being no larger than 1/2 acre. Hartshorn chose the name \\"Short Hills\\" because it reflected the topography of the region, and also because the local Lenape Native Americans used that same name to describe the region. One local resident suggested that he call his village \\"Hartshornville,\\" but he refused, quietly content with Short Hills sharing his initials. = Railroad and postal connections = Short Hills Station, Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad ca. 1895 Hartshorn situated his \\"ideal town\\" near enough to a railroad to allow for an easy commute to Hoboken and, from there, to New York City. Hence, his decision in 1879 to build, at his own expense, a railroad station along the original Morris and Essex Railroad line. He also persuaded the United States Post Office to open a branch in his new railroad station in 1880, and in fact, the Post Office has always had a presence in Short Hills from that day and its own ZIP Code, 07078. = Buffer zones = Hartshorn deliberately preserved strips of land along the railroad right-of-way from any development west of Old Short Hills Road. These strips separate Hobart Avenue to the north, and Chatham Road to the south, from the railway line. The only structure that has ever stood directly adjacent to the line is the railroad station. In 1944, the Hartshorn family also donated Crescent Park to Millburn Township, directly across from the station, with the stipulation that the park always remain open to the public. = Common elements = After seventeen houses were erected, Hartshorn turned his attention to other \\"common elements.\\" These included a Music Hall, which later became the Short Hills Racquets Club. However, Short Hills remains a relatively quiet place. Stewart Hartshorn died in 1937 at the age of 97. His daughter Cora survived him, wrote her own history of the hamlet, and helped establish the Arboretum that bears her name.Meisner, Marian. A History of Millburn Township., Millburn, NJ: Millburn-Short Hills Historical Society and Millburn Free Public Library, 2002. = Later events = In 1968 Temple B'nai Jeshurun relocated from Newark, NJ, to a site in Short Hills. It is the oldest Reform Jewish congregation in New Jersey and, with 1,100 member families, one of the largest Jewish congregations in the state at the time of the move. Most of the property was purchased from Congressman Robert Kean, father of future New Jersey governor Thomas Kean. The land had been given to Kean's family by King George III of the United Kingdom.Strunsky, Steve. \\"ON THE MAP; A Plot of Land, From King George III to a Short Hills Synagogue\\", The New York Times, September 27, 1998.

Seven people, including the drivers of the train and the car, were killed. Collision Class 165 train from Paddington to passing through the level crossing. A half- barrier, with red and white stripes, is lowered over the left-hand carriageway. On 6 November 2004 at 18:12 GMT, the 17:35 service from to , an InterCity 125 (HST) led by a Class 43 power car (43019) collided with a stationary car at an automatic level crossing close to the rural West Berkshire village of Ufton Nervet. The inquest concluded that the crash was caused by Brian Drysdale, a chef at Wokefield Park Hotel away, committing suicide by parking his car on the crossing. All eight coaches derailed and the rear of the InterCity 125 train came to rest about beyond the crossing. Seven people were killed in the crash: the car's driver, the driver of the train, and five of its passengers. About 200 people were on board at the time of the incident (official estimates are around 180‚Äì200). About half of these were injured, 12 of them seriously. Eleven people were cut free from the wreckage. The high structural integrity of the Mark 3 coaches prevented a much higher death toll, plus the fact that the more lightly loaded first-class coaches were at the leading end of the train. More than 20 ambulances from five counties and 14 fire engines attended the crash. Injured passengers were first helped at the Winning Hand pub, to the north. After the collision survivors in some carriages used emergency hammers to break the train windows to escape. The accident occurred at night, and so passengers used emergency glow sticks and their mobile phones to provide some light. Sixty one injured passengers were taken variously to the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading and the North Hampshire Hospital in Basingstoke. Other passengers were treated at the scene and the pub for minor injuries. The crash, investigation and necessary repairs blocked the direct railway between London and the southwest until the morning of 16 November 2004. The line reopened under temporary speed restrictions to allow the bedding in of ballast. In the meantime long-distance trains operated via and and local services were replaced by rail and bus shuttles. Leading power car 43019 was written off. =Background= In the United Kingdom, automatic half-barrier level crossings (AHB/AHBC) are used on roads where traffic is unlikely to queue across the crossing and where rail line-speed is not more than . Other than the train driver's line of sight, which is less effective at night, railway signalling control and train drivers have no means of knowing whether this level crossing (and many others) are clear. Half barriers close the crossing to road traffic but allow any road user on the crossing to escape without the need for a local controller to raise the barriers. =Site= The crash was at a level crossing on the narrow lane linking the village of Ufton Nervet to the Bath Road (A4), about from their junction. Most of the surrounding land is rural including all of the land immediately by the railway. =List of fatalities= * Stanley Martin, 54, of Torquay, Devon (the train driver) * Anjanette Rossi, 38, of Speen, Berkshire (the mother of Louella Main) * Louella Main, 9, of Speen, Berkshire (the daughter of Anjanette Rossi) * Charlie Matthews, 72, of Warminster, Wiltshire * Barry Strevens, 55, of Wells, Somerset * Emily Webster, 14, of Doccombe, Moretonhampstead, Devon * Brian Drysdale, 48, of Reading, Berkshire (the car driver) Investigation An investigation was carried out by Thames Valley Police and British Transport Police. A preliminary report by the Health and Safety Executive indicated that the car stopped on the level crossing before any warnings and failed to react to the barrier alarm sequence. A minor deflection of the stationary car to one side by the train derailed the forward bogie, which continued to travel at about 25¬∞ to the rails until reaching the points at the start of a loop. At this point the power car derailed completely, causing the remainder of the train to derail. The Rail Safety and Standards Board published a preliminary report on 1 February 2005 that stated: * The automatic half-barrier equipment and its associated ancillary equipment is in good condition and properly maintained. * The train driver shut off power and coasted for around four seconds, which was normal for this point in the journey. He then applied the emergency brakes at or about the time of impact with the car. * All lighting was lost in all the coaches during the accident. As a result, passengers and crew found orientation difficult, though the provision of glow sticks alleviated this to some extent. Some passengers who attempted to break windows in order to escape from the vehicle were hampered by the emergency hammers breaking, and by the difficulty of reaching the upper windows of a vehicle leaning heavily to one side. * No evidence has been presented that the maintenance condition of the train contributed in any way to the derailment or exacerbated its consequences. * No evidence has been presented to the inquiry that would indicate there were any deficiencies in the fitness for duty on the part of the staff of either Network Rail or First Great Western. The RSSB report made recommendations including improving emergency communications at the level crossing and moving a set of points whose position was a factor in the train's derailment. Network Rail implemented all the safety recommendations. On 1 June 2005 it was announced that an inquest into the crash would be held at the Guildhall in Windsor, Berkshire. The inquest was expected to last 12 days, starting on 17 October 2005. A delay ensued over whether the families of the victims should be granted legal aid. The inquest finally began in October 2007. A policeman who had witnessed the crash, PC Brazier, testified at the inquest. He told the jury that he believed the crash was caused by a suicide attempt. The Forensic Accident Investigator, David Price, told the inquest that he had been able to determine that the car had been parked on the level crossing with its engine switched off, the handbrake fully applied, the vehicle's lights switched off, the steering on a partial left-hand turn (which was not consistent with driving across the crossing), and that its fuel tank still contained at least 8 litres (about 2 gallons) of petrol. On 1 November 2007 the inquest returned the verdict that the crash was caused by Brian Drysdale's suicide. A support network, the Ufton Nervet Train Crash Network,Ufton Nervet Train Crash Network was set up for survivors and relatives of the victims. Subsequent events =Royal Humane Society awards= In 2005 the Royal Humane Society awarded its bronze medal to two passengers who were on the train: salesman Brian Kemsley and Royal Marines company sergeant major Tom McPhee. The two men found nine- year-old Louella Main and her mother Anjanette Rossi, both of whom had been thrown out of the train by the force of the crash. Rossi was dead but Kemsley testified to the 2007 inquest: Despite the men's efforts Main died of her injuries. Kemsley then found a clergyman who had been a passenger on the train, and got him to walk back to the bodies to say a prayer. McPhee also found injured passenger Sharmin Bacchus trapped in the wreckage, and kept her conscious until she was freed. =Memorial= Ufton Nervet Memorial, Area of Reflection Beside the level crossing a small area of reflection has been created with two wooden benches facing an engraved steel memorial plaque remembering all people affected by the collision. Also, on what would have been his 55th birthday, First Great Western named power car 43139 after the driver of the train. A plaque at the memorial reads: =Replacement bridge= In July 2012 an Internet petition called for the level crossing to be replaced with a bridge. Network Rail subsequently announced that it was considering either converting the crossing to full barriers or a bridge. In March 2014, Network Rail stated that it \\"remained on course\\" to replace the level crossing \\"by mid-2014 or 2015\\". West Berkshire Council approved plans for a road bridge in August 2015, and preparatory work began the following month. On 18 April 2016, Network Rail held a ceremony as construction began. The bridge was officially opened on 16 December 2016. Further incidents After the 2004 crash there were deaths at the crossing in 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2014. The 2010 death was found not suspicious. The coroner's inquest into the 2012 death recorded an open verdict as there was insufficient evidence to be certain that that fatality was the result of suicide. The 2012 collision also caused injury to the InterCity 125 driver. British Transport Police concluded that the circumstances surrounding the 2014 fatality were not suspicious. There was a near miss at the same level crossing on 4 September 2011. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch investigated the cause, which was found to be an error by a signaller working in a central location who failed to contact the train driver and the attendant at the crossing. This failure was likely due to work overload of the signaller.

Among many other works, he wrote the famous \\"Katyusha\\" (1938), performed to this day internationally. He was active as a composer until 1975, producing more than two thousand songs. Childhood and education Birthplace of Matvey Blanter Blanter, the son of a Jewish craftsman, was born in the town of Pochep, then in the Chernigov Governorate of the Russian Empire. He studied piano and violin at the Kursk Higher Music School. From 1917 to 1919, he continued his education in Moscow, studying violin and composition. Career Blanter's first songs were composed in the 1920s. At the time, he wrote light dance and jazz music, including \\"John Gray\\" (1923), a foxtrot that became a major hit. In the 1930s, as Soviet culture grew more ideologically strict, Blanter shifted toward writing Soviet propaganda songs. He emerged as one of the creators of the Soviet \\"mass song\\". Some of Blanter's 1930s songs were styled after the Red Army songs of the Russian Civil War (1918‚Äì1921) and mythologized the war's Bolshevik heroes. The most famous among these are \\"The Song of Shchors\\" (1935), telling the tale of Ukrainian Red Army commander Nikolai Shchors, and \\"Partisan Zheleznyak\\" (1936), which combines the energetic rhythms of a military marching song with elements of a mournful ballad as it describes Commander Zheleznyak's heroic death in battle (the song opens and closes with a stanza about Zheleznyak's lonely burial mound in the steppes). Other notable Blanter songs from that period include \\"Youth\\" (1937), a cheerful marching song asserting that \\"right now, everyone is young in our young, beautiful country\\"; \\"Stalin Is Our Battle-Glory\\" (1937), a widely performed hymn to Joseph Stalin; and \\"The Football March\\" (1938), music from which is still performed at the start of every soccer match in Russia. In 1938, Blanter began his long-lasting collaboration with the poet Mikhail Isakovsky. Their first song, undoubtedly the most famous of Blanter's works, was the world-renowned \\"Katyusha\\". In it, Blanter combined elements of the heroic, upbeat battle song and of a peasant song representing a woman's lamentation for an absent lover. Standing on a high riverbank, a young woman, Katyusha, sings of her beloved (compared to \\"a gray eagle of the steppes\\"), who is far away serving on the Soviet border. The theme of the song is that the soldier will protect the Motherland and its people while his girl will preserve their love. While the song is joyful and filled with the imagery of a fertile, blooming land, it also conveys the sense that the motherland is under threat. \\"Katyusha\\" gained fame during World War II as an inspiration to defend one's land from the enemy. In 1937, Pravda published a request for thousands of Soviet girls to go to work in the far east of the county, to help construct military defences. Blanter was commissioned to write the highly-popular operetta On the Bank of the Amur River to celebrate the initiative: the premiere took place at Moscow Operetta Theatre in 1939, and the work was broadcast by Moscow Radio as well as taken up by operatic companies throughout the country. Blanter accompanied the Red Army to Berlin in early 1945. He was commissioned by Stalin to compose a symphony about the capture of Berlin. (Inside Hitler's Bunker, by Joachim Fest, page 136) Blanter wrote several other highly popular wartime songs. His 1945 song, \\"The Enemy Burned Down His Home\\", about a soldier who returns from the front to find his entire family dead, became controversial when the authorities deemed it too pessimistic and banned its performance; it was performed for the first time in 1961. Blanter's postwar songs include \\"The Migratory Birds Are Flying\\" (1949), a patriotic Soviet song in which the narrator watches migratory birds fly away and asserts that he can think of no better place to be than the Motherland, and \\"Dark-Eyed Cossack Girl\\" (Russian: –ß–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–≥–ª–∞–∑–∞—è –∫–∞–∑–∞—á–∫–∞), written especially for the bass- baritone Leonid Kharitonov. Blanter's grave at the Novodevichy Cemetery In 1983, Blanter became a member of the Anti-Zionist Committee of the Soviet Public, an organization created by the Soviet Union as a tool against the Israeli state's aggression against its Arab neighbours. He died in Moscow in 1990.

The Last Battle. London: Collins, 1966. Cornelius Ryan records that Blanter accompanied the Red Army into Berlin during the last days of the war and the collapse of Nazi power. Blanter was present at a hastily convened conference on 1 May 1945, a few hours after Hitler's suicide, between Colonel-General Vasily Ivanovich Chuikov and Lieutenant-General Hans Krebs, Chief of the OKH General Staff, to negotiate surrender of the city. Krebs noted later that there were several Russian 'senior officers' present, yet Chuikov introduced none of them to Krebs: the others were in fact merely war correspondents and interpreters, not military staff - Chuikov had not been able to assemble his staff at such short notice. In a footnote, Ryan adds: > With the two correspondents... was a visiting Soviet composer, Matvei > Isaakovich Blanter, sent by Stalin to write a symphony commemorating the > Berlin victory. The correspondents asked the General what to do with the > composer, and Chuikov said 'Bring him along.' But when Blanter arrived he > was wearing civilian clothes, and it was clear that he could not be passed > off as a Red Army officer. He was hastily shoved into a clothes closet > adjoining the meeting room. He stayed there for most of the ensuing > conference. Just before the visitors left, he fainted from lack of air and > fell into the room, to the utter astonishment of the Germans. It appears that no such symphony was ever composed. In the 2004 film, Downfall, Blanter plays a small role and is portrayed by Boris Schwarzmann. In the film, he is stuffed into the closet of Vasily Chuikov's office, who is in a rush to meet the Nazi general, Hans Krebs.

Pass interference may include tripping, pushing, pulling, or cutting in front of the receiver, covering the receiver's face, or pulling on the receiver's hands or arms. It does not include catching or batting the ball before it reaches the receiver. Once the ball touches any defensive player or eligible offensive receiver, the above rules no longer apply and the defender may tackle the receiver or attempt to prevent him from gaining control of the ball. Once a forward pass is in the air it is a loose ball and thus any eligible receiver ‚Äì all defensive players are eligible receivers ‚Äì may try to catch it. When a defensive player catches a forward pass it is an interception and his team gains possession of the ball. Some actions that are defined as pass interference may be overlooked if the defender is attempting to catch or bat the ball rather than focusing on the receiver. The intended receiver may find himself a defender if a defensive player has a better chance to catch a forward pass. If an offensive player commits pass interference against a defensive player attempting to intercept a forward pass it is offensive pass interference. Variations Rules for pass interference differ between American and Canadian football: * Pass interference rules in American high school and college football clearly cover only forward passes that travel beyond the neutral zone. In the National Football League (NFL), the rule is that \\"there can be no pass interference at or behind the line of scrimmage\\". In Canadian football, pass interference rules are applied throughout the field of play. This leads to differences in the application of the rule on screen passes in which the intended receiver is behind the line of scrimmage: ** A defender who makes contact with an intended receiver behind the line of scrimmage cannot be called for pass interference at any level of American football, although he may still be guilty of a different foul. The NFL is specific about which foul can be called in that situation, stating that \\"defensive actions [behind the line of scrimmage] such as tackling a receiver can still result in a 5-yard penalty for defensive holding, if accepted.\\" In the same situation in Canadian football, the defender can be called for pass interference if his contact is deemed illegal. ** Offensive pass interference cannot be called behind the line of scrimmage in American football. In Canadian football, although the pass interference rule applies, offensive players are explicitly allowed to interfere with a defender attempting to intercept a screen pass (within certain limitations). In the NFL, the defender may make continuous contact with receiver within the first five yards of the line of scrimmage. Anything after that is penalized as illegal contact. Pass interference is called if the defensive player contacts the offensive player while he is trying to catch the pass, unless the defender has turned his head to face the oncoming pass and is attempting to intercept it. Accidental, glancing contact is not penalized. In high school and college, the defender may make contact with the receiver as long as the receiver is in front of the defender. These provisions end when the pass is in the air. If the incident occurred on a special teams fake play, the rule does not apply under NFL rules. Penalties In the NFL and the Canadian Football League (CFL) the penalty for defensive pass interference is an automatic first down at the spot of the foul. If the foul occurs in the end zone, the ball is placed at the one-yard line (or half the distance to the goal if the line of scrimmage was inside the two-yard line). In U.S. college football and amateur Canadian football, the penalty is an automatic first down at the spot of the foul, up to a maximum of 15 yards from the previous spot. In U.S. high school rules the penalty for both offensive and defensive pass interference is 15 yards from the previous spot with the down replayed. Prior to 2013, the penalty for defensive pass interference also included an automatic first down while the penalty for offensive pass interference included a loss of down. In the NFL and CFL, the penalty for an offensive pass interference is 10 yards from the previous spot. In amateur Canadian football, the penalty is 15 yards. In certain situations a defensive player might deliberately try to commit pass interference against an intended receiver who would surely make a huge gain or score a touchdown were he to catch the ball. This is especially true in NCAA and amateur Canadian football, where the penalty for pass interference that occurs more than 15 yards upfield is less severe than under professional rules. In U.S. high school, if the covering official deems the interference intentional rather than incidental, 15 additional yards may be assessed.

It flows from Joeperry Lake to join the Moira River in Tweed. The river's name is thought to come from Ojibwa words meaning \\"burnt shoreline\\". Course The river begins at Joeperry Lake in Bon Echo Provincial Park in Addington Highlands, Lennox and Addington County, northwest of Cloyne, at an elevation of . It flows south, taking in the right tributary Rainy Creek, and reaches Pearson Lake. The river continues south and empties into Skootamatta Lake at an elevation of . The right tributary Killer Creek joins at the lake. It flows south over Skootamatta Dam, continues south and reaches Slave Lake at an elevation of . It continues south over a small dam, takes in the right tributary Partridge Creek, and arrives in the community of Flinton. The Skootamatta River then flows over Flinton Dam, heads southwest, passes into Hastings County and takes in the left tributary Flinton Creek at an elevation of . The river continues south, takes in the left tributary Little Skootamatta Creek at an elevation of , and turns west just north of Highway 7. The river takes in the right tributary Elzevir Creek, heads southwest under the highway at Actinolite and runs parallel to Highway 37. It reaches its mouth at the Moira River, at an elevation of , which flows into the Bay of Quinte on Lake Ontario. History Until 1908, the river was used to transport logs to sawmills in the Belleville area. At one time, there was a small hydroelectric station on the river near Slave Lake which generated power for a nearby gold mine.

politician of the Democratic Party in Montana; he served as a United States Senator from 1923 until 1947. He returned to his law practice and lived in Washington, D.C. for his remaining years. Wheeler was an independent Democrat who initially represented the left wing of the party, receiving support from Montana's labor unions. In 1923, he played a crucial role in exposing the Harding administration's unwillingness to prosecute people involved in the Teapot Dome scandal.https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/07/archives/burton-k-wheeler- isolationist-dies.html He ran for vice president in 1924 on the Progressive Party ticket headed by Wisconsin Republican Robert La Follette, Sr.. An ardent New Deal liberal until 1937, he broke with President Franklin D. Roosevelt on the issue of packing the United States Supreme Court. In foreign policy from 1938 to 1941 he became a leader of the non-interventionist wing of the party, fighting against entry into World War II until the attack on Pearl Harbor. Background Wheeler was born in Hudson, Massachusetts, to Mary Elizabeth Rice (n√©e Tyler) and Asa Leonard Wheeler.Burton K. Wheeler (with Paul F. Healy), Yankee From The West: The Candid, Turbulent Life Story of the Yankee- born U.S. Senator from Montana, Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1962, full text online at Internet Archive website, accessed December 12, 2012 He grew up in Massachusetts, attending the public schools. He first worked as a stenographer in Boston, Massachusetts. He traveled west to attend University of Michigan Law School, where he graduated in 1905. He initially intended to settle in Seattle, but after getting off the train in Butte, Montana, he lost his belongings in a poker game. The new attorney settled there and began practicing law. Career =1910s= Wheeler was elected as a Montana state legislator in 1910, and in that position, he gained a reputation as a champion of labor against the Anaconda Copper Mining Company, which dominated the state's economy and politics. He was appointed as a United States Attorney. During his tenure, he was notable for not issuing a single sedition indictment during World War I, especially significant as Montana was a large stronghold of the Industrial Workers of the World. In other parts of the country, IWW membership was suppressed under the new sedition law. =1920s= Time cover, 18 Jun 1923 US Senator Burton K. Wheeler In 1920, Wheeler ran for Governor of Montana, easily winning the Democratic primary, and he won the support of the Non-Partisan League in the general election. The ticket included a multi- racial set of candidates, unusual for 1920, including an African American and a Blackfoot Indian.Current Biography 1940, p. 858 Wheeler was defeated by Republican former U.S. Senator Joseph M. Dixon. Wheeler ran as a Democrat for the Senate in 1922, and was elected over Congressman Carl W. Riddick, the Republican nominee, with 55% of the vote. He broke with the Democratic Party in 1924 to run for Vice President of the United States on the Progressive Party ticket led by La Follette. They carried one state‚ÄîLa Follette's Wisconsin‚Äîand ran well in union areas and railroad towns. Early on in his career as a U.S. Senator, Wheeler played a leading role in exposing the Harding Administration's unwillingness to prosecute administration officials involved in the Teapot Dome scandal. His special committee held sensational Senate hearings regarding bribery and other corruption in Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty's Justice Department, which ultimately resulted in the indictment of Daugherty and others.https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/burton_wheeler/411492https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1993/04/23/the- indictment-and-trial-of-sen-wheeler/0291e2af-9aa7-4914-a279-8956a8743542/ In 1925, Wheeler faced investigation, without major impact, by Blair Coan, a Justice Department investigator from Chicago, who suspected Wheeler of involvement in communist conspiracy. Wheeler returned to the Democratic Party after the election, which Republican Calvin Coolidge won in an Electoral College landslide. He served a total of four terms and was re-elected in 1928, 1934, and 1940. =1930s= In 1930, Wheeler gained national attention when he successfully campaigned for the reelection to the U.S. Senate of his friend and Democratic colleague Thomas Gore, the colorful \\"Blind Cowboy\\" of Oklahoma. Wheeler supported President Franklin D. Roosevelt's election, and many of his New Deal policies. He broke with Roosevelt over his opposition to the Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937, and also opposed much of Roosevelt's foreign policy before World War II. In the 1940 presidential election, there was a large movement to \\"Draft Wheeler\\" into the presidential race, possibly as a third party candidate, led primarily by John L. Lewis. In 1938, Wheeler introduced Senate Resolution 294, a \\"sense of the senate\\" statement that, in order to insure fair competition, AM radio stations in the United States should be limited to a transmitter power of 50,000 watts.\\"Limitation of Power of Radio Broadcast Stations\\" (Senate Resolution 294), Journal of the Senate of the United States of America (Seventy-Fifth Congress, Third Session), June 9, 1938, page 507. Now commonly known as the Wheeler resolution, it was approved on June 13, 1938\\"Radio Stations Broadcasting in Standard Band\\", Journal of the Senate of the United States of America (Seventy-Fifth Congress, Third Session), June 13, 1938, page 539. and the next year the Federal Communications Commission implemented a 50,000 watt cap, which still remains in force.\\"Proposed New FCC Rules Well Received\\", Broadcasting, February 1, 1939, pages 16-17, 70-73. =1940s= Wheeler, an outspoken non- interventionist, opposed the U.S. entry into World War II. As tensions mounted in Europe, he supported the anti-war America First Committee, appearing to give the Nazi salute at a rally for the committee in 1941. As chair of the \\"Wheeler Committee\\" (formally, the Subcommittee to Investigate Railroads, Holding Companies, and Related Matters of the United States Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce), Wheeler announced in August 1941 he would investigate ‚Äúinterventionists‚Äù in the motion picture industry, which was interpreted as anti-Semitic. He questioned why so many foreign-born men were allowed to shape American opinion. \\"Critics charged that the Committee was motivated by animus to Jewish studio heads.\\"David Gordon.America First: the Anti-War Movement, Charles Lindbergh and the Second World War, 1940-1941 Representing the studios was 1940 Republican Presidential candidate Wendell Willkie who charged that Wheeler and other critics sought to impose the same kind of censorship that Nazi Germany was enacting all over Europe. Wheeler also led the attack on Roosevelt's Lend Lease Bill charging that if passed \\"it would plow under every fourth American boy\\".Inside U.S.A. (Gunther), p. 175. Roosevelt in response charged that Wheeler's statement was \\"the damnedest thing said in a generation\\". After the start of World War II in Europe, Wheeler opposed aid to Britain or the other Allies, already fighting in the war. On October 17, 1941, Wheeler said: \\"I can't conceive of Japan being crazy enough to want to go to war with us.\\" One month later, he added: \\"If we go to war with Japan, the only reason will be to help England.\\" The United States Army secret Victory Program was leaked on 4 December 1941 to Wheeler, who passed this information on to three newspapers.Charles E. Kirkpatrick, Writing the Victory Plan of 1941, Ch. 4, \\"Detailed Planning\\", United States Army Center of Military History, CMH Pub 93-10. Following Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, Wheeler supported a declaration of war saying, \\"The only thing now to do is to lick the hell out of them.\\" Wheeler sought renomination in 1946 but was defeated in the Democratic primary by Leif Erickson, who attacked Wheeler as insufficiently liberal and for his \\"pre-war isolationist\\" views. Erickson in turn was defeated by Republican state representative Zales Ecton. =1950s= On September 15, 1950, Wheeler served as counsel to fellow Democrat from Minnesota Max Lowenthal during the latter's testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee. Wheeler did not return to politics, nor full-time to Montana, but took up his law practice in Washington, D.C. Aided by research by his daughter, Frances (died 1957), Wheeler wrote his autobiography, with Paul F. Healy, Yankee from the West, published in 1962 by Doubleday & Company. He dedicated the book to his wife and daughter. Personal life and death Wheeler married Lulu M. White. They had six children: John, Elizabeth, Edward, Frances, Richard and Marion. Frances helped her father with his research for his autobiography, Yankee from the West: The Candid, Turbulent Life Story of the Yankee-born U.S. Senator from Montana, which he published in 1962 and dedicated to her and his wife.Yankee from the West: The Candid, Turbulent Life Story of the Yankee-born U.

In popular culture *The 1939 film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and its source material, the unpublished novel \\"The Gentleman from Montana,\\" were loosely based on Wheeler's experience investigating the Harding administration.https://www.loc.gov/static/programs/national-film-preservation- board/documents/mr_smith.pdf *During the 1946 campaign, David George Plotkin wrote and published The Plot Against America: Senator Wheeler and the Forces Behind Him, a political pamphlet against Wheeler by supporters of the Communist Party USA. It accused Wheeler and Harry S. Truman of being part of a fascist conspiracy.\\"Wheeler's Progress: The Evolution of a Progressive\\", antiwar.com, May 1, 2009. * In Philip Roth's alternate history novel The Plot Against America (2004), and its television adaptation, Wheeler serves as vice president during the fictional presidency of Charles Lindbergh. Roth depicted Wheeler as a political opportunist, who, while serving as acting president during Lindbergh's absence, imposes martial law. (However, Wheeler had historically been known as a leading opponent of the martial law imposed by the Governor of Montana Sam V. Stewart during World War I.) * In a lesser- known alternate history novel, The Divide (1980) by William Overgard, Wheeler becomes President in 1940, campaigning on a platform of isolationism despite Axis victories (far larger than those which actually occurred). When the U.S. belatedly enters the war, it is defeated in 1946 and partitioned between Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, and Wheeler is ultimately executed as a war criminal.

The Concise Household Encyclopedia states, \\"Some people eat this apple raw in order to cleanse the palate, but Bramley's seedling is essentially the fruit for tart, pie, or dumpling.\\"The Concise Household Encyclopedia (ca. 1935), Amalgamated Press Ltd, London Once cooked, however, it has a lighter flavour. A peculiarity of the variety is that when cooked it becomes golden and fluffy. Tree Bramley's Seedling apple trees are large, vigorous, spreading and long-lived. They tolerate some shade. The apples are very large, two or three times the weight of a typical dessert apple. They are flat with a vivid green skin which becomes red on the side which receives direct sunlight. The tree is resistant to apple scab and mildew and does best when grown as a standard in somewhat heavy clay soil. It is a heavy and regular bearer, and as a triploid, it has sterile pollen. It needs a pollinator but cannot pollinate in return, so it is normally grown with two other varieties of apple for pollination. It has won many awardsBramley Apples website: History accessed 17 January 2010 and currently holds the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (H4). Edward Cocking, the scientist who developed the Bramley Clones Most of the stock of Bramley's Seedling commercially available is slightly different in its growth habit and other characteristics from the original tree, probably because of a chance mutation (or mutations) that occurred unnoticed over the years. Plants produced from the still-surviving (then 180-year-old) tree by tissue culture in 1990 have proved to be much more compact and free-branching than the widely available commercial stock. The cloning work was done by scientists at the University of Nottingham, including Professor Edward Cocking, because the original tree was suffering from old age and was under attack by honey fungus. Twelve of the cloned trees now grow in the University grounds; one was also planted beside the old tree at Southwell, but was cut down when it was 10 years old.Science Daily website: \\"Turning back the clock to save the Bramley apple\\" (3 April 2009) accessed 17 January 2010 History Bramley's Seedling apples from Nottinghamshire The first Bramley's Seedling tree grew from pips planted by Mary Ann Brailsford-Trump when she was a young girl in her garden in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, UK in 1809. The tree in the garden was later included in the purchase of the cottage by a local butcher, Matthew Bramley, in 1846. In 1856, a local nurseryman, Henry Merryweather, asked if he could take cuttings from the tree and start to sell the apples. Bramley agreed but insisted that the apples should bear his name. On 31 October 1862, the first recorded sale of a Bramley was noted in Merryweather's accounts. He sold \\"three Bramley apples for 2/- to Mr Geo Cooper of Upton Hall\\". On 6 December 1876, the Bramley was highly commended at the Royal Horticultural Society's Fruit Committee exhibition. In 1900, the original tree was knocked over during violent storms; it survived, and is still bearing fruit two centuries after it was planted. However, it was reported in 2016 that the tree was suffering from a fungal infection and may be dying. The variety is now the most important cooking apple in England and Wales, with 21.68 km¬≤, 95% of total culinary apple orchards in 2007. DEFRA Orchard fruit survey 2007 The Bramley is almost exclusively a British variety; however it is also grown by a few United States farms, and can be found in Canada, Australia and Japan. The town of Southwell hosts many celebrations of the Bramley Apple including the Bramley Apple Festival. On the 3rd Saturday in October, Southwell Minster hosts the Opening Ceremony and the Food & Drink Festival. The Bramley Apple Inn is located just a few doors away from the original apple tree, BBC visits the original Bramley apple tree which is considered to be a town treasure. In 2018, 27 Church Street was bought by Nottingham Trent University to preserve the building and the tree for posterity. The tree can be visited by prior appointment. A blue plaque on the house in Southwell now commemorates the apple, and in 2009 a window commemorating the 200th anniversary of the planting of the tree was installed in Southwell Minster. thumb As a young man Henry Merryweather worked as a gardener on the nearby Norwood Park Estate, and when John Ralph Starkey bought the Hall, Gardens and pasture in 1880, he turned to Henry Merryweather for advice about which apples and fruit he should be planting on his acreage. Being a new local celebrity, the Bramley Apple was suggested and the first commercial orchard of Bramley was established at Maythorne Orchard, close to the Lower Kirklington Road on what is now a Golf course. Armagh Bramleys Bramley apples from County Armagh enjoy Protected Geographical Indication status within the European Union. The apples have a tarter taste than those grown in England, and over 40,000 tonnes are produced annually. Cooking Bramleys work well in pies, cooked fruit compotes and salads, crumbles, and other dessert dishes. They are also used for chutneys but only form a base for cider, due to their acidity. Whole Bramley apples, cored and filled with dried fruit, baked, and served with custard is an inexpensive and traditional British dessert. Bramleys are also used for apple sauce. Regardless of the dish, Bramley apples are generally cooked in the same basic way. First the fruit is peeled and then sliced, and the pieces covered in lemon juice (or some other acidic juice) to stop them turning brown. Sugar is often added. In pies and crumbles, the fruit is simply covered with the topping and baked; the moisture in the apples is sufficient to soften them while cooking. The flavour may be spiced, according to taste, with cloves, mixed spice or cinnamon. To make apple sauce, the apples are sliced and then stewed with sugar and lemon juice in a saucepan. Bramley's Seedling apples are favoured for producing a jelly which is very pale in colour.Florence White (1952), Good English Food, Jonathan Cape, London. Because the tree is a heavy cropper and liable to glut, it is a fine candidate for the domestic production of fruit wine, alone or with other fruits, and cider if mixed with a sweeter Cox or similar.

It was founded in 1982, and at 21 July 2020 had 3931 members overall, of whom 3033 were accredited professionals; it also has 80 accredited organisations.. CIfA members are drawn from across the archaeological community, and from around the world - in 2018 the membership included archaeologists from 40 countries. Accredited membership is by election following a satisfactory demonstration of archaeological experience and competence and an undertaking to abide by the Institute's Code of conduct. CIfA's aims are to advance the practice of archaeology and allied disciplines by promoting professional standards and ethics for conserving, managing, understanding and promoting enjoyment of the heritage. CIfA is currently based at the University of Reading. History The idea of establishing an institute for archaeologists came about in 1973 when the Council for British Archaeology set up a working party on Professionalism in Archaeology. This was due to a rapid increase in the number of employed archaeologists and the need for a body to be responsible for the establishment and maintenance of professional standards in archaeology. In 1979 an Association for the Promotion of the Institute of Field Archaeologists (APIFA) was established. This group determined that the objectives of the proposed Institute of Field Archaeologists (IFA) should include ‚Äòthe definition and maintenance of appropriate standards of * Training and education in field archaeology * Responsible and ethical conduct in the execution and supervision of work * Conservation of the archaeological heritage‚Äô In May 1980 APIFA published a draft Code of conduct; the election of the Institute‚Äôs founding Council was held on 21 December 1982. The first chair and Member No 1 was Professor Peter Addyman and other notable early members were Mick Aston (21), Philip Barker and Francis Pryor (15). Recognising that archaeologists work in all aspects of the historic environment, in 2008 members voted in favour of adopting a trading name of the Institute for Archaeologists along with a rebrand to reflect this. At the 2013 AGM, members agreed that a formal petition for Royal Charter should be made to the Privy Council and on 9 December 2014 the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists was officially launched marking a significant step for the archaeological profession and bringing it in step with other chartered institutes. Services CIfA is responsible for the production and maintenance of a Code of conduct along with a variety of Standards and Guidance documents and policy statements and practice guides . It promotes the value of professional ethics and provides a number of online resources As well as lobbying and making representations to national and local government and other agencies on behalf of its members, it champions professionalism in archaeology. CIfA's overall goal is for clients to engage only accredited professionals with the necessary skills to carry out archaeological services and to support this is organises conferences and training initiatives, accredits courses, provides online Continuing Professional Development facilities, and has a wide range of specialist and area networks. Its publications include a regular magazine The Archaeologist, and a Yearbook and Directory. Members also receive a reduction on The Historic Environment: Policy and Practice, a journal published by Taylor & Francis. CIfA also holds an annual conference in spring, and its Annual General Meeting (AGM) - which usually also incorporates a training event - in the autumn. Membership =Individual= CIfA offers three professionally accredited grades: Practitioner (PCIfA) accreditation is open to those who have undertaken skilled tasks within the historic environment sector under the guidance of others; Associate (ACIfA) accreditation is open to those who have carried out, delegated or brought to conclusion pieces of work within the historic environment sector, with some autonomy but without holding ultimate responsibility, and Members (MCIfAs) accreditation is open to those with the highest level of responsibility within the historic environment sector with sole responsibility to initiate, negotiate, carry out and/or delegate, and bring to conclusion pieces of work. Accredited members may be professional or amateur archaeologists and are permitted to use the relevant post nominal abbreviation after their names. All accredited members have full voting rights within the Institute. CIfA accreditation is recognised by the Construction Skills Certification Scheme to qualify for a CSCS card. Affiliate and student memberships are also available. Student membership is open to students in full or part-time at under- or post-graduate level, where archaeology is studied in equal or greater weight to another subject. Student membership is retained for up to 12 months after graduation after which it is automatically transferred to Affiliate membership. Affiliate membership is open to those who have an active interest in archaeology but do not yet qualify for a accreditation. =Organisation= In 1996 CIfA launched a Register of Archaeological Organisations which provides a quality assurance scheme for archaeological organisations. Like with individual accreditation, in return for registration, the scheme requires organisations to comply with the Code of conduct and to work in accordance with defined policies and procedures, and current best practice. =International= CIfA regards itself as a UK-based organisation that operates internationally, and individual membership is open to archaeologists from any part of the world. In 2017-18 the German archaeological association DGUF worked with CIfA to set up CIfA Deutschland; the group was formally established in 2019. A CIfA Australia group was set up in the following year. CIfA has also entered into memoranda of understanding with other archaeological associations with similar objectives. These include the European Association of Archaeologists (EAA), the Register of Professional Archaeologists (RPA) in the United States of America, DGUF in Germany, and the Institute of Archaeologists of Ireland (IAI). Issues Low pay and poor job security in archaeology have been a major problem throughout the Institute's history and there is often a misunderstanding about CIfAs role, as a professional association in addressing this as opposed to a trade union or trade association. The Institute has a vital role to play in improving and maintaining standards of archaeological work, and in enhancing the status of archaeologists. It believes that inadequate pay and conditions undermines the work it does in these areas and is keen to ensure that the issue of pay is proactively addressed by the whole sector. As a result CIfA has a published policy statement on pay and pushed to establish an Industry Group to discuss relevant issues within the sector with Prospect and Federation of Archaeological Managers and Employers.

Der Deutsche Michel (\\"Michael the German\\") is a figure representing the national character of the German people, rather as John Bull represents the English. He originated in the first half of the 19th century. Overview Michel differs from figures that serve as personifications of the nation itself, as Germania did the German nation and Marianne the French, in that he represents the German people. He is usually depicted wearing a nightcap and nightgown, sometimes in the colors of the German flag, and represents the Germans' conception of themselves, especially in his easy-going nature and Everyman appearance. In any event, the nightgown and the night cap, which have been present in all pictorial representations of the German Michel - the first ones dating from the first half of the nineteenth century - are also interpreted in a way that the German Michel is, in fact, a rather naive and gullible person, not prone, for example, to question the authority of the government. On the contrary, he prefers a decent, plain and quiet lifestyle. Over the centuries, the character traits attributed to the German Michel were subject to some change. The British historian Eric Hobsbawm wrote the most notable aspect of Deutscher Michel as portrayed in Imperial Germany was that: \\"The point about Deutscher Michel is that his image stressed both the innocence and simple- mindedness so readily exploited by cunning foreigners, and the physical strength he could mobilize to frustrate their knavish tricks and conquests when finally roused. 'Michel' seems to have been essentially an anti-foreign image\\". The central problem of creating a national identity in the newly unified Reich was all of the various German states had their own histories and traditions, none of which could be used as a symbol to appeal to everybody, leading to a situation where Hobsbawam noted: \\"Like many another liberated' people', 'Germany' was more easily defined by what it was against than in any way\\". The xenophobic tendency to the Deutscher Michel character in the 19th century, whose innocence stands in marked contrast to the cunning and devious foreigners who are always trying to trick him, reflected the fact it was more easy to define the Reich in terms of what it was against rather than it was for. In this regard, Deutscher Michel was very different from Marianne who was defined in a more positive way as a symbol of the republic and its values. A typical cartoon featuring Deutscher Michel occurred in the May 1914 edition of the magazine Kladderadatsch where Deutscher Michel is working happily in his garden with a seductive and voluptuous Marianne on one side and a brutish muzhik (Russian peasant) on the other; the message of the cartoon was that France should not be allied to Russia, and would be better off allied to Germany, since Deutscher Michel with his well tended garden is clearly a better potential husband than the vodka-drinking muzhik whose garden is a disorderly disaster. To further reinforce the point, Deutscher Michel is pouring cold water on two chickens in a cage whose initials stand for Alsace- Lorraine, meaning that Germany can pour cold water on France's hopes of taking back Alsace-Lorraine anytime it wants. The caption has Deutscher Michel saying that he wants peace, but if his neighbors want war, then they will get it, reflecting the fact that Michel for all his good-natured and easy-going ways, is utterly ferocious when angered. In German, Michel is also the short form of Michael, though quite rare today.

These Goths were mentioned in the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries. History Emperor Valens (r. 364‚Äì378) settled Goths in Moesia and planned to use them for protection. In 382, the Thervingi received land in Moesia by treaty with Roman Emperor Theodosius I. In the 460s, the Thracian Goths were recognized ' (barbarian military aid to the Romans) of the Eastern Roman Empire, and seem to have prospered. They had an annual subsidy, and some influence due to the proximity of Thrace to Constantinople. In 471, the Thracian Goths under Theodoric Strabo revolted after fearing they would be removed, Emperor Leo having come under the influence of his son-in-law, general Zeno. Two years later the Pannonian Goths (Ostrogoths) under Theodemir decided to move into Thrace, presumably wanting to share the benefits of the Thracian Goths. Leo made agreements with both Gothic groups, settling the Goths under Theodemir in Macedonia and renewing Strabo's subsidy and elevating him to '. Zeno succeeded Leo after his death in 474, while Strabo supported a coup staged by Leo's widow to put her brother Basiliscus on the throne; however, Zeno won back power in 476 with his Isaurian troops. In 476/77, Zeno allied himself with Theodoric Strabo's rival, Theoderic the Great or Theoderic the Amal (r. 474‚Äì526), the successor of Theodemir, and ordered him to attack Strabo. The leader of the Thracian Goths sent an embassy to the Byzantine emperor, offering peace and blaming the Amal. Zeno believed that this offering was hiding further conspiracies, and obtained that the Byzantine senate and army declare Strabo a public enemy. Zeno planned to have the two Theoderics attack each other. He sent the Amal against Strabo, with the promise of a huge East Roman force as reinforcement (478). The Ostrogoths under king Theoderic advanced as far as Marcianopolis in Thrace in 478. The Moesian Goths prepared to cross the Balkan mountains (Sondis), and were then told that their Roman gold awaited south of the mountain. Theoderic the Amal did not find the Roman reinforcement army he expected, but Theoderic Strabo's army instead, in a strongly fortified camp. Strabo provoked the Amal, running in front of the Moesian Gothic camp and claiming that the leadership of the Amal had reduced the Goths to fighting each other, and only for the Roman gain, to have none of the wealth for which they had moved from their territories. With this speech recalling the common interest of the Goths, Strabo forced the Amal to ask for peace. The two Theodorics agreed to put forward a joint request to the Emperor, in order to extend Moesian Gothic territory to the south. According to Jordanes ( 551), the Moesian Goths were taught to write by Ulfilas (311‚Äì383). They were, according to him, still present in Moesia, \\"numerous, but poor and unwarlike, rich in nothing save flocks of various kids and pasture-lands for cattle and forests for wood ...

The 122 was similar to the first two generations of the General Motors 60¬∞ V6 engine; sharing cylinder bore diameters and some parts . The 122 was available in the US beginning in 1982 for the GM J platform compact cars and S-series trucks. For the J cars, it evolved through 2002 when it was replaced by GMs Ecotec line of DOHC 4-cylinder engines. In the S-10 related models, it evolved through 2003 and was known as the Vortec 2200. Production ceased consistent with the replacement of the S-series trucks with the GMT 355 sub-platform. Generation I =1.8= L46 The 1.8 L pushrod engine was the first engine to power the J-Body cars.

They were in common use in China from the twelfth century, and were used by the Aztecs. Surviving examples of chairs from medieval Europe are often ornate works associated with royalty and nobility. During the Renaissance, chairs came into more common use, their design reflecting the changing costumes and furnishings of the period. Distinctive designs developed in France and England. In modern times the range of chair designs and materials has increased enormously. Egyptian chairs The chair of Hetepheres I, the mother of Khufu Egyptian chairs.Ancient Egyptian Furniture in Egypt appear to have been of great richness and splendour. Fashioned of ebony and ivory, or of carved and gilded wood and metal, they were covered with costly materials and supported upon representations of the legs of beasts or the figures of captives. Egyptians believed that the chairs need to represent natural forms to avoid creating chaos in the universe, by creating an artificial object. This tendency is seen all over Egyptian art and manufacture. An arm-chair in fine preservation found in a tomb in the Valley of the Kings is astonishingly similar, even in small details, to that \\"Empire style\\" which followed Napoleon's campaign in Egypt. The earliest monuments of Nineveh represent a chair without a back but with tastefully carved legs ending in lions' claws or bulls' hoofs. Others are supported by figures in the nature of caryatides or by animals. Greco-Roman Chairs Klismos chair, with curved backrest and tapering, outcurved legs, on the stele of Xanthippos, Athens, ca. 430-20 BCE alt= The earliest known form of Greek chair dates back to six or seven centuries BCE. On the frieze of the Parthenon, Zeus occupies a square seat with a bar-back and thick turned legs; it is ornamented with winged sphinxes and the feet of beasts. The characteristic Roman chairs were of marble, also adorned with sphinxes. The curule chair was originally very similar in form to the modern folding chair, but eventually received a good deal of ornament. The most famous of the very few chairs which have come down from a remote antiquity is the reputed Chair of Saint Peter in St Peter's Basilica at Rome. The wooden portions are much decayed, but it would appear to be Byzantine work of the 6th century, and to be really an ancient sedia gestatoria. It has ivory carvings representing the labours of Hercules. A few pieces of an earlier oaken chair have been let in; the existing one, Gregorovius says, is of acacia wood. The legend that this was the curile chair of the senator Pudens is necessarily apocryphal. It is not, as is popularly supposed, enclosed in Gian Lorenzo Bernini's bronze chair, but is kept under triple lock and exhibited only once in a century. Byzantium, like Greece and Rome, affected the curule form of chair, and in addition to lions‚Äô heads and winged figures of Victory (or Nike) and dolphin- shaped arms used also the lyre-back which has been made familiar by the pseudo-classical revival of the end of the 18th century. Mexican chairs One type of chair in ancient Mexico is called the icpalli and is mentioned by Jacques Soustelle. The icpalli can be seen in Diego Rivera's mural of the Aztec market of Tlatelolco, Palacio Nacional, Mexico City. The icpalli is also featured in the Codex Telleriano-Remensis; dignitaries and emperors are depicted sitting in them. Medieval chairs Seigneurial chairs at a table with tin cutlery, pottery, medieval glass and earthenware in majolica, c. 1465 The chair of Maximian in the cathedral of Ravenna is believed to date from the middle of the 6th century. It is of marble, round, with a high back, and is carved in high relief with figures of saints and scenes from the Gospels‚Äîthe Annunciation, the Adoration of the Magi, the flight into Egypt and the baptism of Christ. The smaller spaces are filled with carvings of animals, birds, flowers and foliated ornament. The Chair of St. Augustine, dating from at least the early thirteenth century is one of the oldest cathedrae is not in use. Another very ancient seat is the so-called \\"Chair of Dagobert\\" in the Louvre. It is of cast bronze, sharpened with the chisel and partially gilt; it is of the curule or faldstool type and supported upon legs terminating in the heads and feet of animals. The seat, which was probably of leather, has disappeared. Its attribution depends entirely upon the statement of Suger, abbot of St Denis in the 12th century, who added a back and arms. Its age has been much discussed, but Viollet-le-Duc dated it to early Merovingian times, and it may in any case be taken as the oldest faldstool in existence. To the same generic type belongs the famous abbots‚Äô chair of Glastonbury; such chairs might readily be taken to pieces when their owners travelled. The faldisterium in time acquired arms and a back, while retaining its folding shape. The most famous, as well as the most, ancient, English chair is that made at the end of the 13th century for Edward I, in which most subsequent monarchs have been crowned. It is of an architectural type and of oak, and was covered with gilded gesso which long since disappeared. Passing from these historic examples we find the chair monopolized by the ruler, lay or ecclesiastical, to a comparatively late date. As the seat of authority it stood at the head of the lord's table, on his dais, by the side of his bed. The seigneurial chair, more common in France and the Netherlands than in England, is a very interesting type, approximating in many respects to the episcopal or abbatial throne or stall. It early acquired a very high back and sometimes had a canopy. Arms were invariable, and the lower part was closed in with panelled or carved front and sides‚Äîthe seat, indeed, was often hinged and sometimes closed with a key. That we are still said to sit \\"in\\" an arm-chair and \\"on\\" other kinds of chairs is a reminiscence of the time when the lord or seigneur sat \\"in his chair.\\" These throne-like seats were always architectural in character, and as Gothic feeling waned took the distinctive characteristics of Renaissance work. The furniture makers also covered their crude work with gold which is called gilding. Chinese chairs Chinese gentleman sitting in a chair while listening to music and watching a dancer, close-up detail in a 12th-century Song Dynasty remake of the 10th-century original Night Revels of Han Xizai. Chinese armchair made from roots. Qing Dynasty, Qianlong reign, 18th century Before the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), the predominant sitting positions in the Han Chinese culture, as well as several of its neighbors, were the seiza and lotus position on the floor or sitting mats. The earliest images of chairs in China are from sixth-century Buddhist murals and stele, but the practice of sitting in chairs at that time was rare. It was not until the twelfth century that chairs became widespread in China. Scholars disagree on the reasons for the adoption of the chair. The most common theories are that the chair was an outgrowth of indigenous Chinese furniture, that it evolved from a camp stool imported from Central Asia, that it was introduced to China by Nestorian missionaries in the seventh century, and that the chair came to China from India as a form of Buddhist monastic furniture.Kieschnick, John. The Impact of Buddhism on Chinese Material Culture, Princeton University Press, 2003, pp.222-248. In modern China, unlike Korea or Japan, it is not common to sit at floor level. Renaissance In Europe, it was owing in great measure to the Renaissance that the chair ceased to be a mark of high office, and became the customary companion of whoever could afford to buy it. Once the idea of privilege faded the chair speedily came into general use. We find almost at once began to reflect the fashions of the hour. No piece of furniture has ever been so close an index to sumptuary changes. It has varied in size, shape and sturdiness with the fashion not only of women's dress but of men's also. Thus the chair which was not, even with its arms purposely suppressed, too ample during the several reigns of some form or other of hoops and farthingale, became monstrous when these protuberances disappeared. Again, the costly laced coats of the dandy of the 18th and early 19th centuries were so threatened by the ordinary form of seat that a ‚Äúconversation chair‚Äù was devised, which enabled the buck and the ruffler to sit with his face to the back, his valuable tails hanging unimpeded over the front. The early chair almost invariably had arms, and it was not until towards the close of the 16th century that the smaller form grew common. The majority of the chairs of all countries until the middle of the 17th century were of timber (the commonest survival is oak)Knell, David (2000), English Country Furniture: The Vernacular Tradition 1500-1900, ACC, 44. . without upholstery, and when it became customary to cushion them, leather was sometimes employed; subsequently velvet and silk were extensively used, and at a later period cheaper and often more durable materials. . In Abraham Bosse's engraving (illustration, left), a stylish Parisian musical party of about 1630 have pulled their low chairs (called \\"backstools\\" in contemporary England) away from the tapestry-hung walls where they were normally lined up. The padded back panels were covered with needlework panels to suit the tapestries, or in other settings with leather, plain or tooled. Plain cloth across the back hid the wooden framing. Stools with column legs complement the set, but aren't en suite. In seventeenth century France the berg√®re chair became fashionable among the nobility and was often made of walnut. Leather was not infrequently used even for the costly and elaborate chairs of the faldstool form‚Äîoccasionally sheathed in thin plates of silver‚Äîwhich Venice sent all over Europe. To this day, indeed, leather is one of the most frequently employed materials for chair covering. The outstanding characteristic of most chairs until the middle of the 17th century was massiveness and solidity. Being usually made of oak, they were of considerable weight, and it was not until the introduction of the handsome Louis XIII chairs with cane backs and seats that either weight or solidity was reduced. English chairs An English side chair (c. 1850) of unknown maker. The chair is made of papier-m√¢ch√© with inlaid mother of pearl, gilded and painted decoration. Part of the Baltimore Museum of Art collection. Although English furniture derives so extensively from foreign and especially French and Italian models, the earlier forms of English chairs owed but little to exotic influences. This was especially the case down to the end of the Tudor period, after which France began to set her mark upon the British chair. The squat variety, with heavy and sombre back, carved like a piece of panelling, gave place to a taller, more slender, and more elegant form, in which the framework only was carved, and attempts were made at ornament in new directions. The stretcher especially offered opportunities which were not lost upon the cabinet-makers of the Restoration. From a mere uncompromising cross- bar intended to strengthen the construction it blossomed, almost suddenly, into an elaborate scroll-work or an exceedingly graceful semicircular ornament connecting all four legs, with a vase-shaped knob in the centre. The arms and legs of chairs of this period were scrolled, the splats of the back often showing a rich arrangement of spirals and scrolls. This most decorative of all types appears to have been popularized in England by the cavaliers who had been in exile with Charles II, and had become familiar with it in the north- western parts of the European continent. During the reign of William III and Mary II these charming forms degenerated into something much stiffer and more rectangular, with a solid, more or less fiddle-shaped splat and a cabriole leg with pad feet. The more ornamental examples had cane seats and ill- proportioned cane backs. From these forms was gradually developed the Chippendale chair, with its elaborately interlaced back, its graceful arms and square or cabriole legs, the latter terminating in the claw and ball or the pad foot. George Hepplewhite, Thomas Sheraton and Robert Adam all aimed at lightening the chair, which, even in the master hands of Thomas Chippendale, remained comparatively heavy. The endeavour succeeded, and the modern chair is everywhere comparatively slight. 18th-century chairs A reading of Moli√®re, Jean Fran√ßois de Troy, about 1728 Informal, galante manners and a new half- reclining posture that replaced the former bolt-upright demeanor of court and aristocracy in the age of Louis XIV went hand-in-hand with new commodious seat furniture, developed in Paris about 1720 (illustration, right). The new Rococo chairs were upholstered √† chassis, on removable frames secured by clips, so that changes from winter to summer furniture could be effected without recourse to the menuisier. Off-season upholstered frames were stored in the garde-meuble. These early Louis XV chairs have backs upholstered √† la reine, with the back in a flat panel that was ordinarily placed squared to the wall, so that the top-rails' curves complemented those of the boiserie panels behind them. In the illustration, the symmetrical cusped and scrolling seatrails that flow into stubby cabriole legs of these comfortable low armchairs (chauffeuses) have their direct origins in Chinese lacquer tables (not chairs).

French fashions in chairs, as with everything else, radiated from Paris. From the late 1720s, fashionable \\"Louis XV\\" French chairs were constructed without stretchers, which interfered with the unified flow of curved seatrails into cabriole legs that generally ended in scroll feet. According to strict guild regulations in force until the Revolution, French chairmaking was the business of the menuisier alone, whose craft was conjoined with that of the upholsterer (huissier), both of whom specialized in seat- furniture-making in Paris. A range of specialised seats were developed and given fanciful names, of which the comfortable berg√®re (\\"shepherdess\\") is the most familiar. Walnut and beech were the characteristics woods employed; finishes were painted in clear light tones en suite with wall panelling, gilded (sometimes rechampi en blanc) or left in the natural color (√° la capuchine), in which case walnut was the timber used. Fruitwoods were popular for chairmaking in the provinces, where the menuisier might also be called upon to provide carved and moulded boiseries for rooms. Lyon, Bordeaux and Li√®ge all produced characteristic variations on Paris models between ca. 1725 and 1780. A giltwood neoclassical chair, made circa 1770 and signed by Georges Jacob. In the late 1760s in Paris the first Parisian neoclassical chairs were made, even before the accession of Louis XVI, whose name is attached to the first phases of the style. Straight tapering fluted legs joined by a block at the seat rail and architectural mouldings, characterize the style, in which each element is a discrete entity. Louis Delanois, Jean- Claude Sen√© and Georges Jacob were three leading chairmakers in the 1770s and 80s. The 18th century was indeed the golden age of the chair, especially in France and England (including Colonial America), between which there was considerable give and take of ideas. Even Diderot could not refrain from writing of them in his Encyclop√©die. The typical Louis Seize style chair, oval-backed and ample of seat, with descending arms and round-reeded legs, covered in Beauvais or some such gay tapestry woven with Boucher or Watteau- like scenes, is a very gracious object, in which the period reached its high- water mark. The Empire brought in squat and squabby shapes, comfortable enough no doubt, but entirely destitute of inspiration. English Empire chairs were often heavier and more sombre than those of French design. Though some stories attribute its invention to Benjamin Franklin, historians trace the rocking chair's origins to North America during the early 18th century. It arrived in England shortly after its development, although work continued in America. The production of wicker rocking chairs reached its peak in America during the middle of the 18th century. 19th-century chairs The art nouveau school produced chairs of simplicity. The Arts and Crafts movement produced heavy, straight lined, minimally ornamented chairs. One of the most famous of those chairs is the Michael Thonet Bendwood chair or the bistro chair, created in 1859. It has revolutionized the industry and is still being produced today. 20th-century and modern chairs The 20th century saw an increasing use of technology in chair construction with such things as all-metal folding chairs, metal-legged chairs, the Slumber Chair, moulded plastic chairs and ergonomic chairs, recliner chairs (easy chair), butterfly chair, beanbag chairs, the egg or pod chair, plywood and laminate wood chairs, and massage chairs. Architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright and Eero Saarinen also designed chairs to match the design of their buildings.

History Founded in 1886 by a German Jesuit on the invitation of Bishop Richard Gilmour, the school was originally a six-year secondary school based on the German Gymnasium that was to be attended after the completion of six years of grammar school. Separate four- year high school and college programs were formed in 1902, with the college changing its name to John Carroll University in 1923 and moving out of the Cleveland location to neighboring University Heights, Ohio in 1935. The words and music of St. Ignatius' alma mater were composed by the school's band director, Jack T. Hearns, Sr., in August 1937. His band debuted the alma mater at halftime during a football game on October 1, 1937, replacing their customary \\"Victory March\\". In 1958, St. Ignatius gave St. Xavier High School in Cincinnati permission to adapt the song. Campus Saint Ignatius High School remains at its original location at 1911 West 30th Street.

A pioneering project for New Zealand, the successful rail trail joined the New Zealand Cycle Trail umbrella organisation in 2012, having been one of the inspirations for it. The trail runs in an arc between Middlemarch and Clyde, along the route of the former Otago Central Railway. The trail has become a popular tourist attraction, with 10,000‚Äì12,000 users per year as a conservative estimate, and yearly (and ongoing) user increases for 6 out of the last 7 years (as of 2011). The trail is also accepted as being, by a large margin, the biggest non-farming economic factor in the Maniototo-Alexandra area. History The original railway line was completed at the turn of the 20th century, and provided a link between Central Otago and Dunedin until closure in 1990. The first 64 km from the junction with the Main South Line in Wingatui remain operational; the initial 4 km form KiwiRail's Taieri Industrial Siding and the remaining 60 km through the Taieri Gorge to Middlemarch is operated by Dunedin Railways as a tourist attraction. The New Zealand Department of Conservation recognised that the remainder of the route to Clyde had potential as a recreational facility, and bought the formation after the rails and sleepers had been salvaged. Since, the trail has come to be recognised as an important feature of the region, highlighted for example by strong interest from numerous groups in a 2011 workshop, where 120 people attended to discuss the further future of the trail, and how to encourage users to stay in the area for longer. The success of the rail trail played an important role in ensuring the New Zealand Cycle Trail project succeeded in gaining funding, and was cited as an example of the kind of infrastructure the project is to provide by New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key. Location of the rail trail. Trail walking / cycling Poolburn Viaduct, one of the former rail bridges re-established for the cycle trail. The trail starts at Middlemarch in the east, loops north through the spectacular countryside of the Strath Taieri and the Maniototo to end at Clyde, on the banks of the Clutha River. The return journey to Middlemarch or Dunedin can be made on foot or by bicycle over the historic Old Dunstan Road, used by the early gold miners to access Central Otago. It traverses open country with little accommodation or food between the typical stops. Users need to be self-sufficient for much of each day. Towns in the area have, however, developed facilities for trail users, and companies have been developed to aid travellers on the trail, such as transporting luggage between destinations. Due to the increasing numbers of pubs now available on the track route, the trail has also been nicknamed the 'Ale Trail'. To enjoy the scenery, the engineering involved in building the railway and the towns and people along the way, 5‚Äì7 days should be allowed to walk the Trail or 3‚Äì5 days to cycle it. The trail starts at 201 metres (660 ft) above sea level in Middlemarch and rises at its highest point to 618 metres (2,028 ft) between Ranfurly and Oturehua. On the journey it passes through three tunnels (the two Poolburn Gorge Tunnels and the Prices Creek Tunnel) and over several large viaducts. A torch (flashlight) is advised for the tunnels. The trail is well maintained and signposted. Toilets are available at several points and the contours are best described as easy, having been built to allow steam trains to climb the gentle inclines even in winter, with frost on the rails. The trail passes through or past several small towns. Mountain bikes can be rented from outlets in Middlemarch, Ranfurly, Alexandra and Clyde. Some of these cycle shops will also provide transport for riders and bikes, and will move luggage. The trail is very popular, and accommodation should be booked well in advance during busy periods such as long weekends and holidays. The trail passes through one of the few parts of New Zealand to have a continental climate, with extremes of temperature common. Midsummer daytime temperatures frequently climb above , and winters can include entire days with a temperature staying below freezing point. One known issue on the trail can be the strong winds that can develop from the nearby mountain ranges under certain weather conditions, slowing riders going in the wrong direction to a crawl. On the Rail Trail The manager of the trail, the Otago Central Rail Trail Charitable Trust, has a website and publishes a leaflet that provides detailed information on the route, and advertisements for businesses providing services to users of the trail. There are visitor information centres in Alexandra, Cromwell, Roxburgh, Ranfurly and Dunedin. Several books on the trail and the surrounding area can be purchased at bookshops throughout New Zealand. The Otago Central Rail Trail at Ranfurly  Usage / Statistics  The trail is used by 10,000‚Äì12,000 users per year as a conservative estimate (14,000 in other estimates) and up to 80,000 further (mostly local) users of part sections. The Poolburn Gorge section was the most popular, with around 24,000 yearly users. Trail patronage is counted using electronic counters, with the numbers at four remote locations extrapolated to estimate the whole trail usage, as not all riders ride the full trail. The users of the trail have been shown as approximately 9% guided tour customers, 50% independent travellers (renting a bicycle) and 41% New Zealanders bringing their own bicycles. A business evaluation has credited the trail with supporting around 1,000 full and part-time jobs, and having created 200 additional or part-time jobs.Investment for the Development of the New Zealand Cycleway Project ‚Äì Cabinet Paper, Ministry of Tourism, May 2009 Annual maintenance and development costs for the trail have been estimated at somewhat over $316,000.

The fastener can take different forms, but typically fall under threaded, unthreaded, or tapped. The bolts may be automatically fed into the stud welder. Weld nuts generally have a flange with small nubs that melt to form the weld. Weld studs are used in stud welding systems. Manufacturers create weld studs for the two main forms of stud welding: capacitor discharge stud welding and drawn arc stud welding  Drawn arc stud welding  Drawn arc stud welding joins a stud and another piece of metal together by heating both parts with an arc. The stud is usually joined to a flat plate by using the stud as one of the electrodes. The polarity used in stud welding depends on the type of metal being used. Welding aluminium, for example, would usually require direct-current electrode positive (DCEP). Welding steel would require direct-current electrode negative (DCEN).Manufacturing Engineering and Technology 6th Edition by Serope Kalpakjian and Steven R. Schmid Page 912 Stud welding uses a flux tip and a ferrule, a ceramic ring which concentrates the heat, prevents oxidation and retains the molten metal in the weld zone. The ferrule is broken off of the fastener after the weld is completed. This lack of marring on the side opposite the fastener is what differentiates stud welding from other fastening processes. = Drawn arc welding studs = Drawn arc studs range from a #8 to 1\\" diameter. The lengths are variable from 3/8\\" to 60\\" (for deformed bars). Arc studs are typically loaded with an aluminium flux ball on the weld end which aids in the welding process. Drawn arc weld studs are commonly made from mild steel and stainless steel. = Short cycle stud welding = Short cycle stud welding is a faster form of drawn arc stud welding which can use capacitor discharge weld studs instead of drawn arc studs. This method can tolerate welding studs to thinner sheet metals than the drawn arc process, though it does not achieve welds that are as strong or penetrative. It also does not require the use of ceramic ferrules. Sometimes operators using this process use shrouding gas to reduce spatter.  Capacitor discharge stud welding  Capacitor discharge stud welding differs from drawn arc stud welding, in that capacitor discharge welding does not require flux. The weld time is shorter, enabling the weld to bond with little oxidation and no need for heat concentration. It also allows for small-diameter studs to be welded to thin, lightweight materials. This process uses a direct-current arc from a capacitor. The weld time in this process is between 1 and 6 milliseconds. Capacitor discharge stud welding with the latest equipment can create a weld without burn-through showing on the opposite side of very thin metals. CD stud welding is often used for smaller diameter studs and pins, as well as on non- standard materials and for accuracy. Drawn arc stud welding is primarily used for structural purposes and larger diameter weld studs. = Capacitor discharge weld studs = Capacitor discharge weld studs range from 14 gauge to 3/8\\" diameter. They come in many different lengths, ranging from 1/4\\" to 5\\" and larger. They are usually manufactured from mild or stainless steel, brass, aluminium, and aluminium alloy. The tip on the weld end of the stud serves a twofold purpose: * It acts as a timing device to keep the stud off the base material. * It disintegrates when the trigger is pulled on the gun. When the tip disintegrates, it melts and helps solidify the weld to the base material.  Automated and robotic stud welding  Portable stud welding machines are available. Welders can also be automated, with controls for arcing and applying pressure. CNC stud welding machines can increase the speed and accuracy of manufacturing and construction work. Stud welding is versatile; typical applications include automobile bodies, electrical panels, shipbuilding and building construction. Shipbuilding is one of the oldest uses of stud welding, and the process revolutionized the shipbuilding industry. Other manufacturing industries can also use stud welding for a variety of purposes, from electrical and mechanical to decorative and consumer products.

In a wasted spark system, the spark plugs fire in pairs, with one plug in a cylinder on its compression stroke and the other plug in a cylinder on its exhaust stroke. The extra spark during the exhaust stroke has no effect and is thus \\"wasted\\". This design halves the number of components necessary in a typical ignition system, while the extra spark, against much reduced dielectric resistance, barely impacts the lifespan of modern ignition components. In a typical engine, it requires only about 2‚Äì3 kV to fire the cylinder on its exhaust stroke. The remaining coil energy is available to fire the spark plug in the cylinder on its compression stroke (typically about 8 to 12 kV). Advantages Perhaps the most significant advantage of the system, compared to a single coil and distributor systems, is that it eliminates the high-tension distributor. This significantly improves reliability, since many problems with a conventional system are caused by the distributor being affected by dampness from rain or condensation, dirt accumulation, and degradation of insulating materials with time. Although plug-top coil systems would later offer this same advantage, they were not available for another 30 years. Plug-top systems increase the number of coils required, increase the heat that these coils must survive and thus require more sophisticated and expensive materials to survive routine usage. Timing signal Wasted spark systems still require a timing signal from the crankshaft. In a conventional four-stroke engine, this signal must also observe the phase of the camshaft relative to the crankshaft, so contact breakers are normally driven from the camshaft and distributor drive. With a wasted spark, the crankshaft can be used instead, as the system fires on both upward strokes. It simplifies the mechanical arrangements since there is no distributor drive and the contact breaker cam can be fixed to the crankshaft. Although a 2:1 reduction gear is still required to operate the camshaft and valves, the precision of this drive is now less critical (ignition timing is more critical for engine performance than valve timing): engines continue to run adequately even with worn camshaft drives and imprecise timing. Practical examples of 'wasted spark' This system has been widely used, including such engines as the MG MG6 1.8T engine; Mitsubishi Evolution 4G63 engine, Mercedes-Benz inline sixes (M104.94x, M104.98x, M104.99x); Buick 3800 engines (LN3 and newer); Harley-Davidson V-Twin; air-cooled BMW Motorcycles; 1948 Citro√´n 2CV, Mazda B engines; Chrysler V10s; GY6 engine; Volkswagen Mark 3 2.8 VR6 (other than 2.0); Saturn Corporation 4 cylinders; Toyota 5VZ-FE V6s; Toyota 5E-FE and Chrysler 1.8, 2.0 & 2.4 engines. Some Ford engines also do. Many Honda and Kawasaki motorcycle and PWC engines also follow a similar design, to allow for a smaller number of more powerful coils to replace a larger number of smaller coils in the same limited space. In practical use, a V-6 engine would only need three coil packs instead of six. Each individual coil fires the spark plugs in two cylinders simultaneously, the spark plug in one cylinder on a compression stroke where the power comes from, and the spark plug in the other cylinder on an exhaust stroke. Coils in a wasted spark system may be in pack form, or they may be in Coil-On-Plug (COP) form, with a spark plug cable attached to each COP unit, which connects to another spark plug. Single cylinder use Most single cylinder [four-stroke] engines use the wasted spark system in order to capitalise on the simplicity and reliability of the flywheel magneto. These engines need a flywheel to run smoothly, and the heavy current-generating magnets help provide the momentum while delivering a zero-maintenance drive to the ignition system. Bolted to the end of the crankshaft, this flywheel rotates twice for each compression stroke. As well as the build-weight and maintenance advantages of this system, there is a tuning advantage. Mounted directly on the end of the crankshaft, all the stress that spark generation would otherwise place on the camshaft chain (or another special purpose half- speed drive) is avoided, while there is virtually none of the strain that necessarily degrades the ignition timing in systems relying on chains or gears. Unlike the multi-cylinder systems noted above (which fire two plugs simultaneously from a double-ended coil) the coil in this system has only a single HT lead running to the single plug. The flywheel magneto provides other services in, for instance, small motorcycles, as it can easily be built to provide direct-current battery-charging power at almost no additional cost or weight. Effect on component life In modern conditions, this method has a very small impact on the length on the service intervals of the vehicle and the longevity of individual components. Modern ignition systems do not have breaker points, which have been almost entirely replaced by electronic systems. Modern ignition coils outlast most other components of the vehicle and modern spark plugs have excellent service life, though there is a slight- difference between the two plugs as to erosion suffered at the center electrode. Because the spark jumps in opposite directions on the companion plugs, one bank will erode the center electrode more, and the opposite bank will erode the ground electrode more. Spark plugs used in wasted spark systems should have precious metals, such as platinum and/or iridium, on both the central and ground electrodes in order to increase the average service interval time before replacement is needed. See p. 824 of the 2015 Champion Master Catalog. http://www.fme-cat.com/catalogs.aspx  Twin plug combustion  Since the earliest gasoline engines, some have used twin spark systems. These have two spark plugs in each cylinder. Each set of plugs is supplied separately. There may be several reasons for this: reliability (typically aircraft), starting, or better combustion performance by initiating the flamefront at opposing points simultaneously (e.g. Alfa Romeo). These are not considered as wasted spark systems, as their sparks all take place after the useful compression stroke, rather than \\"wasted\\" in the exhaust stroke.

The island is in area, rising out of the South Atlantic Ocean south-west of Tristan da Cunha. Inaccessible Island is part of the archipelago of Tristan da Cunha, which is part of the overseas territory of the United Kingdom known as Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. Tristan da Cunha itself is accessible only by sea via a seven-day sail from Cape Town, South Africa, by landing during the 60 days of the year that the harbor allows for access to the island.  Geography  The island sits approximately to the southwest of the main island of the Tristan da Cunha archipelago. Mostly desolate and inhospitable, the island has one small landing site named Port David on the northwesternmost point. Inaccessible Island is fringed with sheer sea cliffs but can be landed on via a few boulder beaches. Generations of sailors were wary of the difficult landings and inhospitable terrain. Inaccessible Island has been without permanent inhabitants since 1873. Along with Gough Island, Inaccessible Island is a protected wildlife reserve and both make up the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Gough and Inaccessible Islands. Inaccessible Island is home to the endemic Inaccessible Island rail, the world's smallest extant flightless bird. History Inaccessible Island was discovered in January 1656 during a voyage by ‚Äôt Nachtglas (\\"the night glass\\"), a Dutch ship under the command of Jan Jacobszoon, 146 years after Tristan da Cunha was first sighted by Portuguese sailors. Jacobszoon originally named it \\"Nachtglas\\" island. There are two explanations for the name \\"Inaccessible\\" island. One is that on maps the newly found island was referred to as \\"inaccessible\\" because the Dutch crew who landed were not able to reach its interior. The other claims that French captain d'Etcheverry renamed the island in 1778 after not being able to land.√âdouard Duc√©r√©, Histoire maritime de Bayonne: Les corsaires sous laÃìncien r√©gime (Bayonne, 1895:307-24) reproduces the sieur d'Etcheverry's manuscript narrative of his voyage to Moluccas in 1770 in the Etoile du Matin and mentions a second voyage in 1772. In 1803, US sealers led by Amasa Delano made landfall on the island. Northern rockhopper penguins, from an engraving after a photograph, published in a book by the naturalist aboard HMS Challenger The Stoltenhoff brothers, who arrived on Inaccessible from Germany in 1871, lived there for two years intending to make a living sealing and selling their wares to passing traders, though such trade was minimal. Due to the scarcity of food, they were \\"overjoyed\\" to be rescued in 1873 during HMS Challenger's visit to examine the flora and fauna there.A Naturalist on the \\"Challenger\\", H. N. Moseley. Page 116. Macmillan and Co., 1879. Fetched from archive.org on 3 June 2009. The South African author Eric Rosenthal chronicled the Stoltenhoffs' adventure in 1952.Rosenthal, Eric (1952) Shelter from the Spray, Cape Town, South Africa: Howard Timmins The nearby Stoltenhoff Island is named after the brothers. In 1922, the Shackleton‚ÄìRowett Expedition's ship, the Quest, stopped by Inaccessible briefly, and on-board naturalist Hubert Wilkins discovered a bird later named (after him) the Wilkins finch (Nesospiza wilkinsi). In 1938, the Norwegian Scientific Expedition spent three weeks on the island, during which time they managed to gain access to the plateau and extensively catalogued plants, birds, and rocks. Another attempt at mapping the island was made during the Royal Society's expedition of 1962 to Tristan da Cunha, which took scientists to Inaccessible Island. Like many other explorers before them, the scientists were not able to reach the interior of the island. Inaccessible Island was declared a nature reserve under the Tristan da Cunha Conservation Ordinance of 1976. Tristan islanders, however, were still permitted to harvest seabirds from the island. In a 1982 expedition (October 16, 1982 ‚Äì February 10, 1983), students and faculty of Denstone College in England made detailed maps of the island, studied its flora, fauna, and geology, and carried out a bird ringing programme on more than 3,000 birds.Denstone Expedition to Inaccessible Island: Denstonian Supplement (Autumn 1983), page 2. In 1997, Inaccessible Island's territorial waters out to were declared a nature reserve under the Tristan da Cunha Conservation Ordinance of 1976. Currently, only guides from Tristan are allowed to take visiting cruise ships to Inaccessible; indeed, most trips to the island are now made at the request of expatriates. In 2004 Inaccessible Island was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Gough Island to create a new site of Gough and Inaccessible Islands. =Shipwrecks= At least three confirmed shipwrecks have occurred off the coast of Inaccessible Island. The first was Blenden Hall, a British ship which set sail in 1821 with 54 passengers and crew aboard with destination Bombay. Captain Alexander Grieg intended to sail past Saint Helena, but adverse currents carried her to Tristan da Cunha. She got caught in seaweed and on 22 July drifted aground on Inaccessible Island. All but two of those aboard survived the shipwreck. They spent the next four months subsisting on wild celery, seals, penguins, and albatross. They managed to build a boat some months later. The first attempt to sail to Tristan failed, resulting in the loss of six people; but the second attempt alerted the Tristanians to their plight. The remainder were then brought to Tristan, where the brig Nerina arrived about two months later and took most to Cape Town, South Africa.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ5692. The other two shipwrecks are the wreck of Shakespeare at Pig Beach in 1883, and Helenslea at North Point in 1897. Flora and fauna When Corporal William Glass and his family became the first settlers at Tristan da Cunha in 1816, goats and pigs were brought to Inaccessible Island to serve as a source of food. Some domestic animals remained for at least 57 years and helped to keep the Stoltenhoff brothers alive during their expedition, but they have now died out. Cattle, sheep, and dogs were also introduced to the island at various points in the island's history, but none remain. No land mammals, reptiles, amphibians, butterflies, or snails have been found at Inaccessible. The island does have 64 native plant species, including 20 types of flowering plants and 17 species of ferns. In addition, 48 invertebrate species exist on the island, 10 of which were introduced. Subantarctic fur seals and southern elephant seals have also been seen at the island in increasing numbers, and cetaceans live in the surrounding waters most notably southern right whales and resident population of dusky dolphins. =Birds= Inaccessible rail Inaccessible is perhaps best known for the Inaccessible Island rail, the world's smallest living flightless bird. The island has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International as a breeding site for seabirds and its endemic landbirds. Birds for which the IBA is significant include northern rockhopper penguins (up to 27,000 breeding pairs), Tristan albatrosses (2‚Äì3 pairs), sooty albatrosses (200 pairs), Atlantic yellow-nosed albatrosses (1,100 pairs), broad-billed prions (up to 500,000 pairs), soft-plumaged petrels (up to 50,000 pairs), spectacled petrels, great shearwaters (up to 2 million pairs), little shearwaters (up to 50,000 pairs), white-faced storm petrels (up to 50,000 pairs), white-bellied storm petrels (up to 50,000 pairs), Antarctic terns, Inaccessible rails (up to 5,000 pairs), Tristan thrushes and Inaccessible buntings. Economy Inaccessible Island has been used by the islanders of Tristan da Cunha for several economic purposes. The island has guano deposits and eggs, but due to the difficulty of traveling about the island, the islanders have generally chosen to go to Nightingale Island instead. In popular culture *Edgar Allan Poe's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket alluded to Nightingale Island, Inaccessible Island, and Tristan da Cunha. *In Patrick O'Brian's The Thirteen Gun Salute (1989), pp. 120‚Äì29, Captain Aubrey's ship Diane, in a dead calm, is carried toward Inaccessible Island by the inshore current. One of the sailors recounts the wreck of a whaling ship that he witnessed when it was lost with all hands in similar conditions. Only a fortunate breeze saves Aubrey's ship. The episode is depicted in the cover painting of the book showing the towering cliffs plunging directly into the sea. *\\"Sea Lion\\", the pseudonym of \\"a serving naval officer\\" (Geoffrey Martin Bennett), wrote The Phantom Fleet (1946), a novel that was predicated on the supposition that Inaccessible Island contained a natural harbour, the entrance to which was concealed from the sea. The antagonists were assembling a fleet of obsolescent warships in this harbour, with the intention of striking a coup de main leading to world domination, a scheme foiled by the derring-do of a naval officer and the guns of the Royal Navy. *Eric Newby passed within sight of Inaccessible Island on his 1938/1939 voyage from Ireland to Australia aboard Moshulu, as chronicled in his books The Last Grain Race and Learning the Ropes. Inaccessible Island was the only land the crew saw on the voyage, until reaching Australia, and was therefore a cause for some excitement. *Daniel Suarez's 2014 novel Influx refers to this island as the location of the underground prison 'Hibernity'.

It has above all food, textile and remnants of mining industries. History Archaeological finds show that the region was densely settled by miners as early as around 1200. The first written mention stems from 1291, the royal free town status from 1410. The Roman Catholic diocese of Rozsny√≥ was founded in 1776. In the Middle Ages, Rozsny√≥ was a prosperous mining town for gold, silver, and iron. Mining activities stagnated from the 16th century (when territories to the south of the town were conquered by Ottoman Turks). Mining - this time mainly of iron ore - was renewed around 1800 and was present in the town throughout the 20th century. It was ruled by Ottoman Empire as part of Filek sanjak (Its centre was Rimaszombat) during periods of 1554-1593 and 1596-1686. It was known as \\"Rojna\\" during Ottoman period. The name of the town probably derives from the German word for rose (Rose, in the German name of the town \\"Rosenau\\").

The population in 2011 was 1,096,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica occupying an area of .Eurostat History The fertile lands were first settled in the early 16th century, resulting in narrow parcels radiating from north to south. Guadalupe became the centre of cereal production on the island, with the lands acquired by many of the principal families of Santa Cruz. Consequently, many of the great houses obtained their wealth from the fields and pasturelands in the west. The parish was create in 1644, following the disaggregation of the western half of the municipality of Santa Cruz da Graciosa, which was then part of the Vila da Praia) and the parish of Santa Cruz da Graciosa. With a population exceeding 3000 inhabitants by the 19th century, for many years the parish was the most populous centre of the island, surpassing the populations in the principal urban centres: Praia and Santa Cruz. Geography The parish of Guadalupe is constituted by several agglomerations, aligned in a dispersed- oriented form along the islands main roadways. It is a multi-polar structure, highlighted by isolated centres that include some residences, churches, schools and imp√©rios, while the majority of homesteads are dispersed along the roadways. The parish is therefore an administrative entity, rather the a social construct; residents are adhere, therefore, more to their locality, rather than the parish. The principal localities in the parish, include: * Guadalupe, the parish centre and location of the parochial church, situated in the heart of the Courelas plain, a zone of fertile lands. With connection to the Santa Cruz, some away, it is the point of convergence of the road network to the northwest and centre. The urban area includes the locations of Pontal, Cruz do Barro Branco (which had its own school until 2003), P√© de Ladeira and, partially, Feteira (sites linked along the axis that connected Guadalupe with Luz), locally known as Sul, owing to the valley formed between Serra das Fontes (in the north) and Serra Dormida (south); * Vit√≥ria, a settlement that occupied the extreme northwest of the island, between the volcanic spatter cones of Pico das Bichas, Pico da Brasileira and Pico das Ter√ßas. Its hermitage, situated in Beira-Mar da Vit√≥ria, was dedicated to Our Lady of Victories, was constructed in 1623 in commemoration of the victory Graciosenses over the Barbary coast pirates on 19 May 1623, in Afonso do Porto (today Porto Afonso). The place had (until the late 20th century) two primary schools, constructed by former residents who had made their fortunes in Brazil, at the end of the 19th century.The building offered by Manuel Jos√© do Conde, the first Viscount of Ros√°rio, for boys' school is marked by a coat-of- arms on its southern facade; and Jo√£o In√°cio Pacheco Leal, was responsible for the construction of a building for girls' school. In addition to the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora da Vit√≥ria, the curate of Vit√≥ria, instituted in 1886, includes the Church of Santo Ant√≥nio, constructed between 1904 and 1907, through contributions from the emigrante community in Brazil and North America, while two imp√©rios were constructed, in Beira-Mar da Vit√≥ria (1918) and in Santo Ant√≥nio da Vit√≥ria (1914). The area of Terra do Conde is celebrated for its wine production and vineyards. * Ribeirinha, is a locality situated north of Serra Branca, between the localities of Brasileira and Almas, is constituted by five agglomerations, that correspond to the axis that converge (from the localities of Alto da Ribeirinha, Caldeiras, Pedreiras, Esperan√ßa Velha and Grotas). These roadways converge at the settlements centre, dominated by the Church of Nossa Senhora da Esperan√ßa, square and bandshelter (inaugurated on 30 July 1967), imp√©rio and old primary school (closed in 2003). The Church of Nossa Senhora da Esperan√ßa was constructed in 1847 and expanded in 1898. The hall was constructed by the Brotherhood of the Holy Spirit, equipped with traditional kitchen, used by gatherings of seniors, functioning as community civic centre at times. In the area of Esperan√ßa Velha a cross identifies the place of the primitive 17th century church, long since destroyed. * Brasileira, a small place situated in a valley fronting the sea, between Pico da Brasileira, Pico das Ter√ßas and Pico das Caldeiras, constituted by an urban area and locality of Jorge Gomes. Without its own hermitage or school, the zone is an extension of Ribeirinha. It was in this locality that, on 13 July 1929, an Amiot 123 titled Marsza≈Çek Pi≈Çsudski piloted by Ludwik Idzikowski crashed, killing the aviator. The plane became lost during the pilot's attempt at crossing the Atlantic, departing from France and destined for New York, the plane tried to land, lost control and crashed: the local is marked by a cross. * Almas, is a locality along the axis linking Guadalupe to the Serra Dormida, marked by a school (closed in 1993), Hermitage of S√£o Miguel Arcanjo (dedicated in the 18th century) and imp√©rio (from 1963). The locality includes the place of Tanque and Manuel Gaspar. Tanque is marked by an interesting reservoir, associated with three springs, dating from the 17th century, encircled by a complex of washhouse. This fertility and open space made settlement and population growth rapid, especially between the end of 15th century and 1550. With increased poverty, the population began to decrease, resulting in an exodus to the United States by the second half of the 20th century.

Due to its elevation, the Blue Ridge Mountains have a humid continental climate. The climate of Virginia, a state on the east coast of the United States, is considered mild compared to other areas of the United States. Most of Virginia east of the Blue Ridge Mountains, the southern part of the Shenandoah Valley, and the Roanoke Valley, has a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfa). In the mountainous areas west of the Blue Ridge, the climate becomes warm-summer humid continental (K√∂ppen Dfb) and oceanic climate (K√∂ppen Cfb). Severe weather, in the form of tornadoes, tropical cyclones, and winter storms, impacts the state on a regular basis. Central Virginia received significant snowfall of 20 inches in December 2009. Climate zones A lot of variations occur because of the state's significant relief. Elevations in Virginia vary from sea level to Mount Rogers at 5,729 ft (1,746 m) above sea level, with major gradations occurring at the edges of the Atlantic Ocean, the end of the Piedmont, and the Blue Ridge and Allegheny chains of the Appalachian Mountains. The moderating influence of the ocean from the east, powered by the Gulf Stream, also creates the potential for hurricanes near the mouth of Chesapeake Bay. Cold air masses arrive over the mountains, especially in winter, which can lead to significant snowfalls when coastal storms known as noreasters move up the Atlantic coast. The interaction of these elements with the state's topography create micro-climates in the Shenandoah Valley, the mountainous southwest, and the coastal plains that are slightly but noticeably distinct from each other. Statistics for selected cities The highest recorded temperature is at Balcony Falls on July 15, 1954 and the lowest recorded temperature is at Mountain Lake on January 22, 1985. Severe weather Thunderstorms are a frequent concern in Virginia. Severe weather is a concern in Virginia. Hurricanes make the coastal area of Virginia vulnerable. It is rare for a major hurricane to threaten the Virginia coast as hurricanes this far north tend to weaken due to cooler coast waters and increasingly westerly winds aloft. Heavy rain from tropical cyclones remains a concern, however. Hurricane Isabel in 2003 brought much destruction from wind and rain, killing 10 directly and doing nearly two billion dollars in damage. Hurricane Gaston in 2004 inundated Richmond after moving ashore South Carolina.David M. Roth. Hurricane Gaston Rainfall Graphic. Hydrometeorological Prediction Center. Retrieved on 2008-01-13.

It is a prequel to his three previous books featuring his most famous character, the cannibalistic serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter. The novel was released with an initial printing of at least 1.5 million copies and met with a mixed critical response. Audiobook versions have also been released, with Harris reading the text. The novel was adapted (by Harris himself) into a film of the same name in 2007, directed by Peter Webber. Producer Dino De Laurentis implied around the time of the novel's release that he had coerced Harris into writing it under threat of losing control over the Hannibal Lecter character, accounting for the perceived diminished quality from Harris' previous books.  Plot Opening in Lithuania during 1941, Hannibal Lecter is eight years old and living in a castle with his parents and sister, Mischa. With the castle located near the eastern front of World War II, the Lecter family escapes to their lodge to elude the advancing German troops. With the castle abandoned, it is soon raided by Germans and civilians aiding them, their hidden art collection being among the stolen loot. Three years later, an advancing Soviet tank stops at the Lecter family's lodge looking for water, only to be bombed by a German Stuka, the explosion killing all but the children. Surviving in the lodge, Hannibal and Mischa are captured when six deserters appear: Vladis Grutas, Zigmas Milko, Bronys Grentz, Enrikas Dortlich, Petras Kolnas and Kazys Porvik. Storming and looting the lodge, they lock the Lecters in the barn. Running low on supplies, the soldiers soon take Mischa; realizing they intend to cannibalize her, Hannibal tries to stop them, only to have his arm broken before he blacks out. Hannibal is later spotted by a Soviet tank crew, wearing shackles and rendered mute. Returned to Lecter Castle, now a Soviet orphanage, Hannibal is found to be irreparably traumatized by the ordeal. Removed from the orphanage by his uncle Robert Lecter, Hannibal goes to live with him in France with his aunt, Lady Murasaki. Visiting a marketplace with his aunt, Lecter assaults butcher Paul Momund when he insults Murasaki. Count Lecter, learning of the slight against his wife, violently confronts the butcher and collapses and subsequently dies from a heart attack. Losing most of the Count's estate to death duties, Lecter and Murasaki move across France, and Lecter flourishes as a medical student, assisting by preparing cadavers for lessons. Locating Momund the butcher, Lecter murders him for his actions, eviscerating and beheading him before eating his cheeks. Suspected by Inspector Popil, Lecter escapes suspicion when Murasaki falsifies evidence, suggesting Momund's death was political. Using sodium thiopental to recall the lodge, Lecter remembers Mischa's murder and her killer's faces, and that the lodge was shelled; the building burning and soldiers fleeing, Lecter was freed by Porvik, who was then crushed by falling debris. Working with Popil to recover his family's stolen art, Lecter attends a recovered art exhibition with Murasaki, and speaks with one of Grutas' men selling the art. Afraid he will uncover their identities, Grutas sends Dortlich to murder him. Returning to the dilapidated lodge, Lecter searches the ruins and finds a bag of buried loot, which also contains the hidden dogtags of his captors. Attacked by Dortlich, Lecter strikes him with his shovel, and ties him to a tree stump. Noosed to a horse, Dortlich confirms Grentz relocated to Canada, and that Kolnas owns a restaurant in Fontainebleau; despite his pleas, Lecter uses the horse to tear off Dortlich's head. Returning to France, Lecter is kissed by Murasaki, who insists that he promise to stop killing and to co-operate with Popil; Lecter responds that he already promised revenge for Mischa, and leaves. Lecter continues his studies only to be stalked during his night-shift by Milko. Outwitting Milko and drugging him, Lecter interrogates him for information on Grutas, before drowning him in an embalming tank and incinerating his remains. Eating at Kolnas' restaurant, Lecter notices his daughter is wearing Mischa's stolen bracelet. Entering Grutas' property, Hannibal sets an improvised bomb and confronts him as he bathes, only to be interrupted by Grutas' guards. As Lecter is about to be killed, his bomb detonates and cuts the power, allowing him to wound the guards and escape in the chaos. Returning to Murasaki's home, Lecter receives a call from Grutas, who threatens to kill her unless he surrenders; overhearing ortolans singing in the background of the phone call, Lecter breaks into Kolnas' home, and then heads to his restaurant. Lecter shows he took Mischa's bracelet from his daughter and, in exchange for information, offers to spare Kolnas and free his family. Giving up the location of Grutas' houseboat, Kolnas then realizes Lecter was lying about holding his family. Attacked by Kolnas, Lecter fatally stabs him through the head with a tant≈ç. Finding and reaching the boat, Lecter sneaks aboard but is wounded by the captain. Killing the guards and captain, Lecter rushes to save Murasaki, only to be shot in the back by Grutas, who boasts while molesting a bound Murasaki. Lecter removes his tant≈ç, dimpled by Grutas' bullet, and uses it to cut Grutas' hamstring. With Grutas disarmed, Murasaki begs Lecter spare him for Popil, only for Grutas to mock him. Taunting that Lecter drank broth made from Mischa, he suggests Lecter kills only to continue lying to himself; enraged, Lecter carves several \\"M\\"s into Grutas, fatally wounding him. Horrified by Lecter, Murasaki declares there's nothing human left inside him to love, and dives overboard. Detonating the houseboat with an improvised explosive, Lecter flees the scene. Arrested by Popil, Lecter is soon freed when popular support for his dispatch of war criminals combines with a lack of hard evidence. Lecter meets with Murasaki, and they say their goodbyes and part. Offered a residency at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, Lecter heads overseas to North America, stopping briefly to visit bar-owner Grentz in Quebec, Canada.  Development  The February 22, 2007 issue of Entertainment Weekly features a quote that suggests that the only reason Thomas Harris wrote the story was out of the fear that a Lecter prequel/origin story would inevitably be written without his involvement. Hannibal Rising film producer Dino De Laurentiis said \\"I say to Thomas, 'If you don't do [the prequel], I will do it with someone else... I don't want to lose this franchise. And the audience wants it...' He said, 'No. I'm sorry.' And I said, 'I will do it with somebody else.' And then he said, 'Let me think about it. I will come up with an idea.'\\"  References   External links  * Hannibal Rising at IMDb * Official Dino De Laurentiis Company website * Official Thomas Harris website * Official Hannibal Rising website * Rising Movie Reviews at Metacritic * Official Hannibal Rising MySpace site Category:Hannibal Lecter novels Category:2006 American novels Category:Fiction set in 1941 Category:American thriller novels Category:Johns Hopkins Hospital in fiction Category:American novels adapted into films Category:Prequel novels Category:Novels about orphans Category:Novels about serial killers Category:Novels about psychopathy Category:Novels set in the 1940s Category:Novels set in France Category:Novels set in Lithuania Category:Novels set in the Stalin era Category:Novels set during World War II Category:Novels about Nazi hunters Category:Novels about Nazi fugitives ","title":"Hannibal Rising"},{"id":"1139577","text":"An agricultural show parade An agricultural show is a public event exhibiting the equipment, animals, sports and recreation associated with agriculture and animal husbandry. The largest comprise a livestock show (a judged event or display in which breeding stock is exhibited), a trade fair, competitions, and entertainment. The work and practices of farmers, animal fanciers, cowboys, and zoologists may be displayed. The terms agricultural show and livestock show are synonymous with the North American terms county fair and state fair. Agricultural shows are an important part of cultural life in small country towns, and a popular event in larger towns and cities. Shows range from small events in small country towns usually lasting two days, through medium-sized events of three days, to large shows, which may run for up to two weeks and combine elements of an amusement park with those of an agricultural show. Although in many countries agriculture shows are increasingly under financial pressure, many towns or areas have a show society and in some areas, several towns and villages in the area all have an annual show. Larger shows often include live entertainment and fireworks in the main arena. The first known agricultural show was held by Salford Agricultural Society, Lancashire, in 1768. Events Cheddar cheese competition. Since the 19th century, agricultural shows have provided local people with an opportunity to celebrate achievements and enjoy a break from day-to-day routine. With a combination of serious competition and light entertainment, annual shows acknowledged and rewarded the hard work and skill of primary producers and provided a venue for rural families to socialise. City shows also provide city people with an opportunity to engage directly with rural life and food production. Agriculture shows are often enlivened with competitive events, including sheaf tossing, show jumping, food competitions, and tent pegging. Demolition derbies and rodeos are popular in the US and campdrafting and wood chopping are often held in Australia. Studs are generally available for a fee. =Livestock shows= Border Leicesters lined up for the judge A livestock show is an event where livestock are exhibited and judged on certain phenotypical breed traits as specified by their respective breed standard. Species of livestock that may be shown include pigs, cattle, sheep, goats, horses, rabbits, llamas, and alpacas. Poultry such as chickens, geese, ducks, turkeys, and pigeons are also shown competitively. There are also competitive shows for dogs, sheepdogs, and cats. Prize-winners at agricultural shows are generally awarded inscribed medals, cups, rosettes or ribbons. The National Museum of Australia has a rare collection of medals documenting the history of agricultural shows and rural industries across Australia. The 111 medals range in date from the mid-19th to the early 20th century and many are associated with significant individuals and organizations.David Allen collection agricultural medals purchased by the National Museum - images and details Agricultural shows and swine influenza =Background= Agricultural shows can be sources of swine influenza transmission in both animal and human populations. Swine influenza is a communicable disease caused by one of several different strains of influenza A virus. Currently, the subtypes of influenza A virus which have been identified in pig populations within the United States are referred to as H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2, all named for their specific genetic makeups.Swine influenza. The Merck Veterinary Manual. 2008. . Archived from the original on 4 March 2016. Retrieved 25 October 2019. These viruses are extremely common in pigs across various industries, including pig showmanship at agricultural fairs, and are easily passed between pigs when proper hygiene and safety measures are not carried out. It is rare for the virus to spread to humans; however, genetic reassortment can lead to susceptibility among humans.Jilani, T. N., Jamil, R. T., & Siddiqui, A. H. (9 June 2019). H1N1 Influenza (Swine Flu). Retrieved 25 October 2019, from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513241/.

(3 January 2019). Retrieved from https://www.cdc.gov/flu/swineflu/keyfacts- In cases such as the 2009 flu pandemic, the virus was transmitted from swine to humans and caused a global pandemic which led to the deaths of approximately 12,000 people in the United States alone.CDC Estimates of 2009 H1N1 Influenza Cases, Hospitalizations and Deaths in the United States, April 2009 ‚Äì 13 February 2010.

For this reason, people who work or spend any time in close proximity with pigs are at risk for infection and must follow specific precautions to prevent the spread of swine influenza. =Swine influenza risk= Certain populations at agricultural fairs are at increased risk of developing serious complications after swine influenza exposure. For instance, pregnant women are more susceptible to swine influenza and have been shown to have increased rates of swine influenza mortality relative to the general population.Maternal and Infant Outcomes Among Severely Ill Pregnant and Postpartum Women with 2009 Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) ‚Äì United States, April 2009‚ÄìAugust 2010. (2011). Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, 60(35), 1193-1196. Similarly, adolescents, infants, and those with serious medical comorbid conditions have disproportionately high rates of mortality with swine influenza.Louie, J., Acosta, Winter, Jean, Gavali, Schechter, . . . California Pandemic Working Group. (2009). Factors Associated With Death or Hospitalization Due to Pandemic 2009 Influenza A(H1N1) Infection in California. JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association, 302(17), 1896-1902. This is concerning as over 3.5 million children in the United States participate in youth agricultural programs every year.Stewart, R.J., Rossow, J., Conover, J.T., et al. (2018). Do animal exhibitors support and follow recommendations to prevent transmission of variant influenza at agricultural fairs? A survey of animal exhibitor households after a variant influenza virus outbreak in Michigan. Zoonoses Public Health, 65(1), 195‚Äì 201. Agricultural fairs can readily lead to swine influenza infection in vulnerable populations because agricultural fairs are frequently visited by entire families, including children and pregnant women. Persons who visit agricultural fairs during a known outbreak of swine influenza should be aware of the potential signs and symptoms of infection. The most common symptoms of swine flu are very nonspecific and include fever, cough, malaise, nausea, and vomiting.Crum-Cianflone, N., Blair, P., Faix, D., Arnold, J., Echols, S., Sherman, S., . . . Hale, B. (2009). Clinical and Epidemiologic Characteristics of an Outbreak of Novel H1N1 (Swine Origin) Influenza A Virus among United States Military Beneficiaries. Clinical Infectious Diseases, 49(12), 1801-1810. Importantly, individuals can have swine flu and exhibit no symptoms whatsoever. In certain populations, however, swine flu can lead to serious medical complications including organ damage and/or death. Individuals with recent swine exposure need to be aware of the symptoms of swine flu and have a low threshold to seek medical care. =Recent swine flu variant outbreaks in the United States= Swine influenza variant viruses have been responsible for several recent outbreaks in the United States associated with contact with pigs at agricultural fairs. The three main Influenza A viruses responsible for these outbreaks are variants of the Influenza A viruses H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2. Recent swine influenza variant outbreaks associated with agriculture fairs in the United States: *2009: global spread of H1N1, starting from the United States in April 2009. On 11 June 2009 the World Health Organization issued an imminent pandemic alert. At this time, 70 countries reported ongoing outbreaks, and over 1 million ongoing cases were documented in the United States alone. H1N1 is now a regularly occurring human influenza virus that continues to circulate seasonally and globally with the other influenza viruses.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). (2010).

There are other recommended prevention strategies to reduce the spread of swine influenza at agricultural fairs. It is suggested that people do not bring food into pig areas, do not take any items such as toys, pacifiers or similar items near the pig areas, avoid close contact with any pigs, and wash hands before and after handling pigs.CDC Take Actions to Prevent the Spread of the Flu Between Pigs and People, July 24th 2019.

Field days typically do not involve livestock, showbags or sideshows, but may include events such as ploughing competitions not usually associated with shows due to the larger space required. In some communities in northern England Field Days (or Club Days) have lost their agricultural character and have become community celebrations. The events are good sources of agricultural information, as organizers can arrange for guest speakers to talk on a range of topics, such as the talk on the yellow-flowering alfalfa at the South Dakota field day. Pecan growers were given a talk on insect control by an entomologist at a recent field day at LSU AgCenter's Pecan Research/Extension Station in Shreveport, La. A Landcare survey conducted in 1992/93 revealed that field days in Australia have a high value among local farmers.

Manchester began expanding \\"at an astonishing rate\\" around the turn of the 19th century as part of a process of unplanned urbanisation brought on by a boom in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. The transformation took little more than a century. Having evolved from a Roman castrum in Celtic Britain, in the Victorian era Manchester was a major locus of the Industrial Revolution, and was the site of one of the world's first passenger railway stations as well as many scientific achievements of great importance. Manchester also led the political and economic reform of 19th century Britain as the vanguard of free trade.Asa Briggs, Victorian cities (1965) pp 83-136pp The mid-20th century saw a decline in Manchester's industrial importance, prompting a depression in social and economic conditions. Subsequent investment, gentrification and rebranding from the 1990s onwards changed its fortunes and reinvigorated Manchester as a post- industrial city with multiple sporting, broadcasting and educational institutions. Manchester has been on a provisional list for UNESCO World Heritage City on numerous occasions. However, since the 1996 bombing, local authorities have persisted on a course of economic evolution rather than prioritising the past. This economic evolution is perhaps best illustrated with the 558 foot (170 metres) Beetham Tower which instantly \\"torpedoed\\" any possibility of World Heritage City status according to one author. Despite this, areas perceived as internationally important in the Industrial Revolution, such as Castlefield and Ancoats, have been sympathetically redeveloped. Etymology The name Manchester originates from the Latin name Mamucium or its variant Mancunio. These names are generally thought to represent a Latinisation of an original Brittonic name. The generally accepted etymology of this name is that it comes from Brittonic *mamm- (\\"breast\\", in reference to a \\"breast-like hill\\").The Cambridge Dictionary of English Place- Names Based on the Collections of the English Place-Name Society, ed. by Victor Watts (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), under MANCHESTER.Hylton (2003), p. 6. However, more recent work suggests that it could come from *mamma (\\"mother\\", in reference to a local river goddess). Both usages are preserved in Insular Celtic languages, such as mam meaning \\"breast\\" in Irish and \\"mother\\" in Welsh. The suffix -chester is from Old English ceaster (\\"Roman fortification\\", itself a loanword from Latin castra, \\"fort; fortified town\\"). The Latin name for Manchester is often given as Mancuniun. This is most likely a neologism coined in Victorian times, similar to the widespread Latin name Cantabrigia for Cambridge (whose actual name in Roman times was Duroliponte). Prehistory Runway 2 of Manchester Airport lies on top of Oversley Farm, a Neolithic farming community. Prehistoric evidence of human activity in the area of Manchester is limited, although scattered stone tools have been found.Nevell (2008), p. 11. There is evidence of Bronze Age activity around Manchester in the form of burial sites. Although some prehistoric artefacts have been discovered in the city centre, these have come from redeposited layers, meaning they do not necessarily originate from where they were found; wider evidence has been found for activity in other parts of the borough.Nevell (2008), p. 12. Before the Roman invasion of Britain, the location lay within the territory dominated by the Brigantes and prior to the Roman conquest of the area in the 70s AD, it was part of the territory of the Brigantes, a Celtic tribe, although it may have been under the control of the Setantii, a sub-tribe of the Brigantes.Kidd (1996), p. 12. For the important prehistoric farm site at Oversley Farm, see . Roman A reconstructed gateway of Mamucium fort The Roman fort of Mamucium was established c. AD 79 near a crossing point on the River Medlock.Gregory (2007), pp. 1, 3. The fort was sited on a sandstone bluff near the confluence of the rivers Medlock and Irwell in a naturally defensible position.Gregory (2007), p. 1. It was erected as a series of fortifications established by Gnaeus Julius Agricola during his campaign against the Brigantes who were the Celtic tribe in control of most of what would become northern England.Mason (2001), pp. 41‚Äì42. It guards the Deva Victrix (Chester) to Eboracum (York) Roman road running east to west, and a road heading north to Bremetennacum (Ribchester).Gregory (2007), pp. 1‚Äì2. The neighbouring forts were Castleshaw and Northwich.Walker (1999), p. 15. Built first from turf and timber, the fort was demolished around 140. When it was rebuilt around 160, it was again of turf and timber construction.Gregory (2007), p. 3. In about 200 the fort underwent another rebuild, this time enhancing the defences by replacing the gatehouse with a stone version and facing the walls with stone.Philpott (2006), p. 66. The fort would have been garrisoned by a cohort, about 500 infantry, of auxiliary troops. Retrieved on 20 July 2008. Evidence of both pagan and Christian worship has been discovered. Two altars have been discovered and there may be a temple of Mithras associated with Mamucium. A word square was discovered in the 1970s that may be one of the earliest examples of Christianity in Britain.Shotter (2004), p. 129. A civilian settlement (the first in Manchester), or vicus, grew in association with the fort, made up of traders and families of the soldiers. An area which has a concentration of furnaces and industrial activity has been described as an industrial estate.Shotter (2004), p. 117. The vicus was probably abandoned by the mid 3rd century, although a small garrison may have remained at Mamucium into the late 3rd and early 4th centuries.Gregory (2007), p. 190. The Castlefield area of Manchester is named after the fort. Post-Roman Looking west along Nico Ditch, near Levenshulme Once the Romans left Britain, the focus of settlement in Manchester shifted to the confluence of the rivers Irwell and Irk.Hylton (2003), pp. 3, 8. During the Early Middle Ages that followed ‚Äì and persisted until the Norman conquest ‚Äì the settlement of Manchester was in the territory of several different kingdoms.Hylton (2003), p. 7. In the late 6th and early 7th centuries, the kingdom of Northumbria extended as far south as the River Mersey, south of what was then the settlement of Manchester. Etymological evidence indicates that the areas to the north west of Manchester (such as Eccles and Chadderton) were British while the parts of Manchester (such as Clayton, Gorton and Moston) were Anglian, and the south west of Manchester was Danish (including Cheadle Hulme, Davyhulme, Hulme and Levenshulme). Between the 6th and 10th centuries, the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex struggled for control over North West England. In 620, Edwin of Northumbria may have sacked Manchester, and the settlement may have been sacked again in 870 by the Danes.Hylton (2003), p. 8. According to legend, Nico Ditch ‚Äì which runs east‚Äìwest from Ashton-under-Lyne to Stretford and passes through Gorton, Levenshulme, Burnage, Rusholme, Platt Field Park in Fallowfield, Withington and Chorlton-cum-Hardy ‚Äì is a defence against Viking invaders and was dug in 869‚Äì870. Whether this is true is uncertain, but the ditch does date from between the 7th and 9th centuries.Nevell (1992), pp. 77‚Äì83. The Anglo Saxon Chronicle detail that in 919 Edward the Elder sent men \\"to Mameceaster, in Northumbria, to repair and man it\\"; this probably refers to a burh at Manchester as an advanced post of Mercia. Although it is unsure where the site is, it is possibly a reference to the Roman fort. In 1055, most of what later became Lancashire was under the control of Tostig. The ancient parish of Manchester covered a wider area than today's metropolitan borough (although not including its full extent), and was probably established in the Anglo- Saxon period (there were at that time only two churches in the parish: at Manchester and Ashton-under-Lyne). Forty distinct townships developed in the parish and in medieval times the royal manor of Salford was the most important of these. Medieval Salford Hundred, with Manchester in the south-east Map of the ancient parish of Manchester Chetham's School of Music Shambles Square was built in 1552. Manchester was administratively part of the Salford Hundred.Kidd (1996), p. 13. In 1086 the hundred covered about and had a population of about 3,000.Hylton (2003), p. 10. It was given to Roger de Poitou; Roger divided the hundred into fiefdoms and made the Gresle family barons of Manchester. Albert de Gresle was the first baron of Manchester. Although the Gresle family did not reside at the manor, Manchester continued to grow in their absence and stewards represented the lords of the manor.'The city and parish of Manchester: Introduction', A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 4 (1911), pp. 174‚Äì187. URL: http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=41404. Retrieved on 4 August 2008. Manchester's entry in the Domesday Book reads \\"the Church of St Mary and the Church of St Michael hold one carucate of land in Manchester exempt from all customary dues except tax\\".Hylton (2003), p. 9. St Mary's Church was an Anglo- Saxon church on the site of Manchester Cathedral; St Michael's Church may have been in Ashton-under-Lyne. The parish of Manchester ‚Äì of which St Mary's Church was a part ‚Äì was the ecclesiastical centre of the Salford Hundred. It covered about and extended as far as the edges of Flixton and Eccles in the west, the Mersey between Stretford and Stockport in the south, the edge of Ashton-under-Lyne in the east, and the edge of Prestwich in the north. That such a large area was covered by a single parish has been taken as evidence of the area's \\"impoverished and depopulated status\\". The only tax the parish was subject to was Danegeld. There was a castle in Manchester overlooking the rivers Irk and Irwell, where Chetham's School of Music stands today. This castle was probably a ringworkNewman (2006), p. 141. and has been described as \\"of no political or military importance\\". By the late 13th century the Grelleys or Gresles, who were barons of Manchester for two centuries, had replaced the castle with a fortified manor house. They used the house as the administrative centre of the manor.Kidd (1996), p. 14. While the town was owned by the lords of the manor, they directly leased land to tenants and created burgage tenements for indirect rent; as well as containing a house, these plots of land could also contain workshops and gardens. The family also owned the only corn mill in the manor which was used by all the tenants of the manor to grind their corn. Medieval Manchester was centred on the manor house and the Church of St Mary mentioned in the Domesday Book. As well as a castle at Manchester, there was also one in Ringway. Ullerwood Castle, a motte-and- bailey, probably dates from the 12th century and was owned by Hamon de Massey who owned several manors in the north east of Cheshire.Nevell (1997), p. 27, 33, 35. The first lord of the manor to actually live in Manchester was Robert Grelley (1174‚Äì1230); his presence led to an influx of skilled workers, such as stonemasons and carpenters, associated with the construction of the manor house.Hylton (2003), p. 11 In the early 13th century, Manchester for a period was not under the control of the Grelleys. Robert Grelley was one of the barons who made King John sign Magna Carta. Grelley was excommunicated for his role in the rebellion and when King John later ignored the terms of Magna Carta, Grelley forfeited his lands. King John died in 1216 and Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent, returned Grelley's land to him on behalf of King Henry III In the medieval period Manchester grew into a market town and had a market every Saturday.Kidd (1996), p. 15. In 1223, Manchester gained the right to hold an annual fair; the market was held in Acresfield ‚Äì where St Ann's Square is today ‚Äì on what was then arable land. It was the first fair to be established in the Salford Hundred and the fourth in south Lancashire.Kidd (1996), pp. 14‚Äì15. Manchester became a market town in 1301 when it received its Charter. On 1 November 1315, Manchester was the starting place of a rebellion by Adam Banastre. Banastre, Henry de Lea, and William de Bradshagh rebelled against Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster.'Liverpool: The castle and development of the town', A History of the County of Lancaster: Volume 4 (1911), pp. 4‚Äì36.

The medieval town's defences incorporated the rivers Irk and Irwell on two sides and a long ditch on the others. The ditch, known as Hanging Ditch, was up to wide and deep. It was spanned by Hanging Bridge, the main route in and out of the town. The name may derive from hangan meaning hollow,Hylton (2003), p. 16. although there is an alternative derivation from the Old English hen, meaning wild birds, and the Welsh gan, meaning between two hills.Cooper (2003), p. 52. It dates to at least 1343 but may be even older.Cooper (2003), p. 51. In the 14th century, Manchester became home to a community of Flemish weavers, who settled in the town to produce wool and linen. This in part helped to develop a tradition of cloth production in the region, which in turn sparked the growth of the city to become Lancashire's major industrial centre. The various townships and chapelries of the ancient parish of Manchester became separate civil parishes in 1866. Thomas de la Warre was a Lord of the Manor and also a priest. He obtained licences from the Pope and King Henry V to enable him to found and endow a collegiate church, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, St. George and St. Denys or St. Denis, the latter two being the patron saints of England and France respectively. Construction began around 1422, and continued until the first quarter of the 16th century. The 'merchant princes' of the town endowed a number of chantry chapels, reflecting an increasing prosperity based on wool. This church later became Manchester Cathedral. Thomas also gave the site of the old manor house as a residence for the priests. It remains as one of the finest examples of a medieval secular religious building in Britain and is now the home of Chetham's School of Music. Growth of the textile trade thumb By the 16th century the wool trade had made Manchester a flourishing market town. The collegiate church, which is now the cathedral, was finally completed in 1500‚Äì1510. The magnificent carved choir stalls date from this period, and in 1513 work began on a chapel endowed by James Stanley, Bishop of Ely, in thanksgiving for the safe return of his kinsman (sometimes said to be his son) John Stanley from the Battle of Flodden. The English Reformation resulted in the collegiate church being refounded as a Protestant institution. One of the more famous Wardens of this institution at the time was Dr John Dee, known as \\"Queen Elizabeth's Merlin\\". The town's growth was given further impetus in 1620 with the start of fustian weaving. In this period Manchester grew heavily due to an influx of Flemish settlers who founded Manchester's new weaving industry.Frangopulo, N. (ed.) (1962) Rich Inheritance. Manchester: Education Committee; pp. 109‚Äì111 In the course of the 17th century, thanks to the development of the textile industry and contacts with the City of London, Manchester became a noted centre of puritanism. Consequently, it sided with Parliament in the quarrel with Charles I. Indeed, it might be said that the English Civil War started here. In 1642, Lord Strange, the Royalist son of the Earl of Derby attempted to seize the militia magazine stored in the old college building. In the ensuing scuffle, Richard Percival, a linen weaver, was killed. He is reckoned by some to be the first casualty in the English Civil War. Lord Strange returned and attempted to besiege the town, which had no permanent fortifications. With the help of John Rosworm, a German mercenary, the town was vigorously defended. Captain Bradshaw and his musketeers resolutely manned the bridge to Salford. Eventually, Strange realised that his force was ill-prepared, and after hearing that his father had died, withdrew to claim his title. During the Commonwealth, Manchester was granted a seat in Parliament for the first time. Maj Gen Charles Worsley, scion of an old Lancashire family and one of Cromwell's most trusted lieutenants, had been given the Mace at the famous dissolution of Parliament in 1654. Elected Manchester's first MP, he did not sit for long before Parliament was again dissolved, leading to the Rule of the Major Generals: effectively martial law. Worsley, given responsibility for Lancashire, Cheshire and Staffordshire, took his duties seriously, turning out alehouses, banning bear baiting and cracking down on the celebration of Christmas. He eventually died in 1656, at a time of the gradual ebbing away of Cromwell's authority.Durston, Christopher (2001) Cromwell's Major-Generals. Worsley and his descendants lived at Platt Hall, Rusholme (now a museum) until 1906. On the English Restoration in 1660, as a reprisal for its defence of the Parliamentarian cause, Manchester was deprived of its recently granted Members of Parliament. No MP was to sit for Manchester until 1832. The consequences of the restoration led to a great deal of soul searching. One clergyman, Henry Newcombe, could not remain in the remodelled Anglican Church, and was instrumental in the establishment of the Cross Street Chapel in 1694. This later passed into Unitarian hands, and a new chapel on the original site can be visited. Humphrey Chetham purchased the old college buildings after the civil war, and endowed it as a bluecoat school. Chetham's Hospital, as it was known, later became Chetham's School of Music. The endowment included a collection of books, which in 1653 became Chetham's Library, the first free public library in the English-speaking world. As of 2017, it is still open and free to use. Retrieved on 6 July 2007. Despite the political setbacks, the town continued to prosper. A number of inhabitants supported the Glorious Revolution in 1688. They became discontented with the Tory clergy at the collegiate church, and a separate church, more to their tastes, was founded by Lady Ann Bland. St Ann's Church is a fine example of an early Georgian church, and was consecrated in 1712. The surroundings, what is now St Ann's Square but was previously known as Acresfield, were in imitation of a London square. About this time, Defoe described the place as \\"the greatest mere village in England\\", by which he meant that a place the size of a populous market town had no form of local government to speak of, and was still subject to the whims of a lord of the manor. In 1745, Charles Edward Stuart and his army entered Manchester en route to London. Despite its previous radicalism, the town offered no resistance and the Jacobites obtained enough recruits to form a 'Manchester Regiment'. It is suggested that this was because the town had no local government to speak of, and the magistrates, who could have organised resistance, were mostly conservative landowners. Moreover, these Tory landowners had taken to apprenticing their sons to Manchester merchants, so the political complexion of the town's elite had changed. The Jacobite army got no further than Derby and then retreated. On their way back through Manchester, the stragglers were pelted by the mob. The luckless 'Manchester Regiment' were left behind to garrison Carlisle, where they quickly surrendered to the pursuing British Army. Industrial Revolution Cotton mills in Ancoats about 1820.

The overhang contained privies, whose waste fell straight into the River Medlock below.Hylton, p. 144. Manchester remained a small market town until the late 18th century and the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. The Spinning Jenny in 1764 marked the beginning of the Industrial Revolution and brought with it the first fully mechanised production process, although some sources define the start of the Industrial Revolution as July 1761, when the Duke of Bridgewater's canal reached Castlefield.Manchester.com Castlefield; guidebook manchester.com Retrieved on 20-December-2017 The myriad small valleys in the Pennine Hills to the north and east of the town, combined with the damp climate, proved ideal for the construction of water-powered cotton mills such as Quarry Bank Mill,Established as a silk mill in 1784 by Samuel Greg at Styal, Cheshire. Pevsner, Nikolaus & Hubbard, Edward (1971) Cheshire. Harmondsworth: Penguin; p. 347. which industrialised the spinning and weaving of cloth. Indeed, it was the importing of cotton, which began towards the end of the 18th century, that revolutionised the textile industry in the area. This new commodity was imported through the port of Liverpool, which was connected with Manchester by the Mersey and Irwell Navigation‚Äîthe two rivers had been made navigable from the 1720s onwards. Manchester now developed as the natural distribution centre for raw cotton and spun yarn, and a marketplace and distribution centre for the products of this growing textile industry. Richard Arkwright is credited as the first to erect a cotton mill in the city. His first experiment, installing a Newcomen steam engine to pump water for a waterwheel failed, but he next adapted a Watt steam engine to directly operate the machinery. The result was the rapid spread of cotton mills throughout Manchester itself and in the surrounding towns. To these must be added bleach works, textile print works, and the engineering workshops and foundries, all serving the cotton industry. During the mid-19th century Manchester grew to become the centre of Lancashire's cotton industry and was dubbed \\"Cottonopolis\\", and a branch of the Bank of England was established in 1826. The city had one of the first telephone exchanges in Europe (possibly the first in the UK) when in 1879 one was opened on Faulkner Street in the city centre using the Bell patent system. By 1881 it had 420 subscribers‚Äîjust 7 years later a new exchange had the capacity for 10 times that number. Manchester Central exchange was still the largest outside the capital in Edwardian times when it employed 200 operators and the city had several other important roles in the history of telephony. Transport The growth of the city was matched by the expansion of its transport links. The growth of steam power meant that demand for coal rocketed. To meet this demand, the first canal of the industrial era, the Duke's Canal, often referred to as the Bridgewater Canal, was opened in 1761, linking Manchester to the coal mines at Worsley. This was soon extended to the Mersey Estuary. Soon an extensive network of canals was constructed, linking Manchester to all parts of England. One of the world's first public omnibus services began in 1824; it ran from Market Street in Manchester to Pendleton and Salford. = The world's first steam passenger railway = In 1830, Manchester was again at the forefront of transport technology with the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the world's first steam passenger railway. This provided faster transport of raw materials and finished goods between the port of Liverpool and mills of Manchester. By 1838, Manchester was connected by rail with Birmingham and London, and by 1841 with Hull. The existing horse-drawn omnibus services were all acquired by the Manchester Carriage Company, Ltd in 1865. Horse-drawn trams began in Salford (1877) and Manchester (1880‚Äì81), were succeeded by electric trams in 1901‚Äì03 and by 1930 Manchester Corporation Tramways were running the third largest system in the UK.Bett, W. H. & Gillham, J. C. (1976) The Tramways of South-east Lancashire. Hanwell, London: Light Railway Transport League ; pp. 5‚Äì6 Population Manchester's population exploded as people moved from the surrounding countryside, and from other parts of the British Isles, into the city seeking new opportunities. Particularly large numbers also came from Ireland, especially after the Potato Famine of the 1840s. The Irish influence continues to this day and, every March Manchester plays host to a large St Patrick's Day parade. It is estimated that about 35% of the population of Manchester and Salford has at least some Irish ancestry. Large numbers of (mostly Jewish) immigrants later came to Manchester from Central and Eastern Europe. The area, including Broughton, Prestwich and Whitefield today has a Jewish population of about 40,000. This is the largest Jewish community outside London by quite some way. To these groups may be added (in later years) Levantines (involved in the Egyptian cotton trade), Germans and Italians. By the end of the 19th century, Manchester was a very cosmopolitan place. Intellectual life The unconventional background of such a diverse population stimulated intellectual and artistic life. The Manchester Academy, for example, opened in Mosley Street in 1786, having enjoyed an earlier incarnation as the Warrington Academy. It was originally run by Presbyterians being one of the few dissenting academies that provided religious nonconformists, who were excluded from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, with higher education. It taught classics, radical theology, science, modern languages, language and history. In the arts, the Hall√© Orchestra, was patronised in its early years, by the German community and attracted a loyal following. Manchester's rapid growth into a significant industrial centre meant the pace of change was fast and frightening. At that time, it seemed a place in which anything could happen‚Äînew industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the so-called 'Manchester School', promoting free trade and laissez-faire), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects and new forms of labour organisation. Such radicalism culminated in the opening of the Free Trade Hall which had several incarnations until its current building was occupied in 1856. It attracted educated visitors from all parts of Britain and Europe. \\"What Manchester does today,\\" it was said, \\"the rest of the world does tomorrow.\\" Benjamin Disraeli, at that time a young novelist, had one of his characters express such sentiments. \\"The age of ruins is past ... Have you seen Manchester? Manchester is as great a human exploit as Athens ...\\" Reform The Peterloo Massacre was a major event in the history of the city At the beginning of the 19th century, Manchester was still governed by a court leet on the medieval model, and a Boroughreeve was responsible for law and order during the daylight hours. The Manchester and Salford Police Act of 1792 created Police Commissioners, whose job was to provide a night-watch. The commissioners were also given responsibility for road-building, street cleaning, street lighting and the maintenance of fire engines.Reid (1989), p. 21. The end of the 18th century saw the first serious recession in the textile trade. There were food riots in 1797, and soup kitchens were established in 1799. Manchester was the scene of the Blanketeer agitation in 1817. Popular unrest was paralleled by discontent with Manchester's lack of representation at Westminster, and the town quickly became a centre of radical agitation. The protest turned to bloodshed in the summer of 1819. A meeting was held in St Peter's Field on 16 August to demonstrate for parliamentary reform. It was addressed by Henry Hunt, a powerful speaker known as Orator Hunt. Local magistrates, fearful of the large crowd estimated at 60,000‚Äì80,000, ordered volunteer cavalry from the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry to clear a way through the crowd to arrest Hunt and the platform party. The Yeomanry were armed with sabres and some reports say that many of them were drunk. They lost control and started to strike out at members of the crowd. The magistrates, believing that the Yeomanry were under attack, then ordered the 15th Hussars to disperse the crowd, which they did by charging into the mass of men, women and children, sabres drawn. These events resulted in the deaths of fifteen people and over six hundred injured. The name \\"Peterloo\\" was coined immediately by the radical Manchester Observer, combining the name of the meeting place, St Peter's Field, with the Battle of Waterloo fought four years earlier. One of those who later died from his wounds had been present at Waterloo, and told a friend shortly before his death that he had never been in such danger as at Peterloo: \\"At Waterloo there was man to man but there it was downright murder.\\"Reid (1989), p. 201. The Manchester Guardian, a newspaper with a radical agenda, was established shortly afterwards. In 1832, following the Great Reform Act, Manchester elected its first MPs since the election of 1656. Five candidates, including William Cobbett, stood and Liberals Charles Poulett Thomson and Mark Philips were elected. The Great Reform Act led to conditions favourable to municipal incorporation. Manchester became a municipal borough in 1838, and what remained of the manorial rights were later purchased by the town council. Industrial and cultural growth The prosperity from the textile industry led to an expansion of Manchester and the surrounding conurbation. Many institutions were established including Belle Vue Zoological Gardens (founded by John Jennison in 1836), the Manchester Athenaeum (1836‚Äì37), the Corn Exchange (1837) and the Royal Victoria Gallery of Practical Science (1840‚Äì42). This wealth fuelled the development of science and education in Manchester. The Manchester Academy had moved to York in 1803 and, though it returned in 1840, in 1853 it moved again to London, eventually becoming Harris Manchester College, Oxford. However, a Mechanics' Institute, later to become UMIST, was founded in 1824 by among others, John Dalton the \\"father of atomic theory\\". In 1851 Owens College was founded by the trustees of John Owens, a textile merchant who had left a bequest for that purpose. Owens College was to become the first constituent college of the Victoria University which was granted its Royal Charter in 1880. This flowering of radicalism and reform took place within the context of ferment in Manchester's cultural and intellectual life. John Dalton lectured on his atomic theory at the Literary and Philosophical Society in 1803. The establishment of the Portico Library in 1806, the Royal Manchester Institution (later the Art Gallery) in 1823, and the Manchester Botanical and Horticultural Society in 1827 are evidence of this. The growth of city government continued with Manchester finally being incorporated as a borough in 1838, covering what is now the city centre, along with Cheetham, Beswick, Ardwick, Chorlton upon Medlock and Hulme. In 1841, Robert Angus Smith took up work as an analytical chemist at the Royal Manchester Institution and started to research the unprecedented environmental problems. Smith went on to become the first director of the Alkali Inspectorate and to characterise, and coin the term, acid rain. Manchester continued to be a nexus of political radicalism. From 1842 to 1844, the German social philosopher Friedrich Engels lived there and wrote his influential book Condition of the Working Class in England (1845). He habitually met Karl Marx in an alcove at Chetham's Library. In 1846 the Borough bought the manorial rights from the Mosley family and the granting of city status followed in 1853. In 1847 the Manchester diocese of the Church of England was established. In 1851, the Borough became the first local authority to seek water supplies beyond its boundaries. By 1853, the number of cotton mills in Manchester had reached its peak of 108.Miller and Wild (2007), p. 77. Warehouses became commonplace in what now makes up the city centre. These 19th century Mancunian warehouses were often decorative and ornate for a building of such simple function. The most notable 19th century warehouse is Watts Warehouse on Portland Street. The Cooperative Wholesale Society was formed in 1863. Manchester is now home to the Co-operative Group, the largest mutual business in the world with over six million members. The group remained based on their listed estate in Manchester city centre. The outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 saw an immediate shortage of cotton and the ensuing cotton famine brought enormous distress to the area until the war ended in 1865. The first Trades Union Congress was held in Manchester (at the Mechanics' Institute, David Street), from 2 to 6 June 1868. Manchester was the subject of Friedrich Engels' The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, Engels himself spending much of his life in and around Manchester. Manchester was also an important cradle of the Labour Party and the Suffragette Movement. Manchester's golden age was perhaps the last quarter of the 19th century. Many of the great public buildings (including the town hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the Hall√© Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy. Albert Square During the late 19th century Manchester began to suffer an economic decline, partly exacerbated by its reliance on the Port of Liverpool, which was charging excessive dock usage fees. Championed by local industrialist Daniel Adamson, the Manchester Ship Canal was built as a way to reverse this. It gave the city direct access to the sea allowing it to export its manufactured goods directly. This meant that it no longer had to rely on the railways and Liverpool's ports. When completed in 1894 it allowed Manchester to become Britain's third busiest port, despite being 40 miles (64 km) inland. The Manchester Ship Canal was created by canalising the Rivers Irwell and Mersey for from Salford to the Mersey estuary at the port of Liverpool. This enabled oceangoing ships to sail right into the Port of Manchester (actually in Salford). The docks functioned until the 1970s when their closure led to a large increase in unemployment in the area. = The world's first industrial estate = Trafford Park in Stretford (outside the city boundaries) was the world's first industrial estate and still exists today, though with a significant tourist and recreational presence. Manchester suffered greatly from the inter-war depression and the underlying structural changes that began to supplant the old industries, including textile manufacture. Further expansion Expansion of the city limits was constrained westwards (with the borough of Salford immediately to the west, having been given a charter in 1844). These areas were included in the city limits of Manchester at these dates:- * 1885: Harpurhey, Bradford-with- Beswick, Rusholme * 1890: Crumpsall, Blackley and Moston, Newton Heath, Clayton, Openshaw, West Gorton * 1903: Heaton Park. So far most expansion had been northerly and easterly. * 1904: Moss Side, Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Withington, Burnage, Didsbury, all to the south. * 1909: Gorton, Levenshulme. * 1931: The parishes of Northenden, Baguley and Northen Etchells, beyond the River Mersey, previously in Bucklow Rural District in Cheshire. They later formed the Wythenshawe housing estate. This followed an unsuccessful attempt to annex the same area in 1927.Manchester Extension Bill Approved.

Chandler). Retrieved 28 August 2007 In the early 20th century Manchester's economy diversified into engineering chemical and electrical industries. The stimulus of the ship canal saw the establishment of Trafford Park, the world's first industrial park, in 1910 and the arrival of the Ford Motor Company and Westinghouse Electric Corporation from the USA. The influence is still visible in \\"Westinghouse Road\\" and a grid layout of numbered streets and avenues. In 1931 the population of Manchester reached an all-time peak of 766,311. However, the period from the 1930s onwards saw a continuous decline in population. During this period, textile manufacture, Manchester's traditional staple industry went into steep decline, largely due to the Great Depression of the 1930s and foreign competition. Significant changes in this period were the move of the Manchester Royal Infirmary from Piccadilly in 1908 and the building of a new public library and town hall extension in the 1930s. =Second World War= Manchester Central Library, St Peter's Square In the Second World War Manchester played a key role as an industrial manufacturing city, including the Avro aircraft factory (now BAE Systems) which built countless aircraft for the RAF, the most famous being the Avro Lancaster bomber. As a consequence of its war efforts, the city suffered heavily from bombing during the Blitz in 1940 to 1941. It was attacked a number of times by the Luftwaffe, particularly in the \\"Christmas Blitz\\" of December 1940, which destroyed a large part of the historic city centre and seriously damaged the cathedral. =Post-war= The Royal Exchange ceased trading in 1968. The 1950s saw the start of Manchester's rise as a football superpower. Despite the Munich air disaster, Manchester United F.C. went on to become one of the world's most famous clubs, rising to a dominance of the English game from the early 1990s onwards. Mancunian Films had been established by John E. Blakeley in the 1930s as a vehicle for northern comedians such as George Formby and Frank Randle. The company opened its own studios in Manchester in 1947 and produced a successful sequence of films until Blakeley's retirement six years later. The studio was sold to the BBC in 1954, the same year that saw the advent of commercial television in the UK. The establishment of Granada Television based in the city attracted much of the production talent from the studios and continued Manchester's tradition of cultural innovation, often with its trademark social radicalism in its programming. The same period saw the rise to national celebrity of local stars from the Granada TV soap opera Coronation Street, which was first aired on ITV in December 1960 and remains on air more than 50 years later. The city also attracted international media and public attention for the success of its two senior football clubs‚ÄîManchester United and Manchester City. Manchester United had won two league titles and a FA Cup in the first two decades of the 20th century, but the inter-war years had been blighted by a loss of form on the pitch and ongoing financial problems. The club's revival occurred with the appointment of Matt Busby as manager in 1945; he guided the club to an FA Cup triumph in 1948 and a league title in 1952. He then built a highly successful new side consisting of mostly young players (nicknamed the Busby Babes by the media) which went on to win two league titles and became the first English club to play in the new European Cup. Then tragedy struck in February 1958; eight of the club's players (three of them established England internationals; Roger Byrne, Tommy Taylor and Duncan Edwards) died as a result of the Munich air disaster on the return flight from a European Cup tie in Yugoslavia and two others injured to such an extent that they never played again. Busby, who was seriously injured in the crash, was left to build a new team. His new United side, built around Munich crash survivors including Bill Foulkes and Bobby Charlton, went on to dominate the English game in the 1960s, featuring new stars like Denis Law and George Best, winning two more league titles, a FA Cup and then the European Cup in 1968‚Äîthe first English club to win the trophy. Busby retired the following year after 24 years in charge. The club was less successful in the 1970s, its only major trophy of the decade being the FA Cup in 1977, and the club even spent a season outside the top division of English football. The 1980s were slightly more successful with a further two FA Cups wins and regular top four league finishes, but the club has enjoyed an unmatched run of success which began after the appointment of Alex Ferguson as manager in 1986. By the time Ferguson retired in 2013 after 27 years as manager, the club had won a further 13 league titles, five FA Cups, four League Cups and two European Cups. High-profile players to have played for the club during Sir Alex Ferguson's management (he was knighted in 1999) include Bryan Robson, Mark Hughes, Ryan Giggs, Eric Cantona, David Beckham and Wayne Rooney. Manchester City entered the Football League in 1899, and won their first major honour with the FA Cup in 1904. Manchester City had been league champions once and FA Cup winners twice by 1939, but enjoyed further success in the post-war years, starting with an FA Cup win in 1956. The club's next success came more than a decade later, with a league championship triumph in 1968, an FA Cup triumph in 1969, and a double of the European Cup Winners' Cup and Football League Cup in 1970 under the management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. Great players of the 1950s and 1960s sides included Don Revie, Bert Trautmann, Francis Lee, Colin Bell and Tony Book. They won the League Cup in 1976 but after losing the 1981 FA Cup Final, the club went through a period of decline, which eventually saw them relegated as far down as third tier of English football by the end of the 1997‚Äì98 season. They since regained promotion to the top tier in 2001‚Äì02 and have remained a fixture in the Premier League since 2002‚Äì03. For 80 years until 2003, the club had played at the Maine Road stadium in the Moss Side area of the city, before moving to the City of Manchester Stadium to the east of the city centre, which had been constructed for the previous year's Commonwealth Games. In 2008, Manchester City was purchased by Abu Dhabi United Group for ¬£210 million and received considerable financial investment. The club's next major trophy was the FA Cup in 2011. The club's first top division league title for 44 years followed in 2012, and a League Cup triumph followed in 2014. The club have now won six domestic league titles. Under the management of Pep Guardiola they won the Premier League in 2018 becoming the only Premier League team to attain 100 points in a single season. In 2019, they won four trophies, completing an unprecedented sweep of all domestic trophies in England and becoming the first English men's team to win the domestic treble. Manchester City's revenue was the fifth highest of a football club in the world in the 2017‚Äì18 season at ‚Ç¨527.7 million. UK Business Insider In 2018, Forbes estimated the club was the fifth most valuable in the world at $2.47 billion. As with many British cities during the period. The 1950s and 1960s saw extensive re-development of the city, with old and overcrowded housing cleared to make way for high-rise blocks of flats. This changed the appearance of Manchester considerably, although the high-rise experiment later proved unpopular and unsuccessful. The city-centre also saw major re-development, with developments such as the Manchester Arndale. Manchester's key role in the industrial revolution was repeated and the city became a centre of research and development. Manchester made important contributions to the computer revolution. The father of modern computing Alan Turing was based at Manchester University and it was his idea of the stored-program concept that led in 1948 to the Manchester Baby, which was the first electronic stored-program computer to run a programme. This was developed by Frederic C. Williams and Tom Kilburn at the University of Manchester. This was followed by the Manchester Mark 1, in 1949. These inventions were commercialised in the Ferranti Mark 1, one of the first commercially available computers. In the late 1950s, Manchester was chosen as a testing ground for a new telephone service which formed the foundations of what we now know of as mobile phone technology. The \\"Post Office South Lancashire Radiophone Service\\" was controlled from the city's Peterloo telephone exchange and enabled customers with the apparatus installed in their vehicle to phone to any UK subscriber. In 1974, Manchester was split from the county of Lancashire, and the Metropolitan Borough of Manchester was created. The diversification of the city's economy helped to cushion the blow of this decline. However, as with many inner-city areas, the growth of car ownership and commuting meant that many people moved from the inner-city and into surrounding suburbs. By 1971 the population of Manchester had declined to 543,868, and by 2001 422,302. =IRA bomb and its effects= IRA bombing Exchange Square undergoing extensive regeneration. During the 1980s, with the demise of many traditional industries under the radical economic restructuring often known as Thatcherism, the city and region experienced some decline. The revival started towards the end of the decade, catalysed, not only by wider growing prosperity in the UK but by the creative music industry. New institutions such as Factory Records and Fac 51 Hacienda earned the city the sobriquet Madchester. At 11.20 am on Saturday 15 June 1996, the IRA detonated a large bomb in the city centre, the largest to be detonated on British soil. Fortunately, warnings given in the previous hour had allowed the evacuation of the immediate area, so this bomb caused over 200 injuries but no deaths. The principal damage was to the physical infrastructure of nearby buildings. Since then the city centre has undergone extensive rejuvenation alongside the more general efforts to regenerate previously run-down areas of the wider city (such as Hulme and Salford). This reconstruction spurred a massive regeneration of the city centre, with complexes such as the Printworks and the Triangle creating new city focal points for both shopping and entertainment. The following regeneration took over a decade to complete. The completion of the renovated Manchester Arndale in September 2006 allowed the centre to hold the title of the UK's largest city centre shopping mall.\\"CADWeb Project Management - Manchester Arndale\\", CADWeb, 2005, retrieved 28 June 2007 The bomb is commemorated by a plaque fixed to a nearby postbox which withstood the blast, which reads \\"This postbox remained standing almost undamaged on June 15, 1996 when this area was devastated by a bomb. The box was removed during the rebuilding of the city centre and was returned to its original site on November 22nd 1999\\". 21st century Beetham Tower, Manchester's tallest building, was completed in 2006 In 2002, the city hosted the XVII Commonwealth Games very successfully, earning praise from many previously sceptical sources. Manchester has twice failed in its bid to host the Olympic Games, losing to Atlanta in 1996 and Sydney in 2000. In the 1990s, Manchester earned a reputation for gang-related crime, particularly after a spate of shootings involving young men, and reports of teenagers carrying handguns as \\"fashion accessories\\". A more concerted effort to reduce such crime has focused on prohibiting the availability of firearms, working with the community, deterring young individuals from joining gangs and jailing ringleaders have all helped to reduce gun crime. Consequently, gun crime has plummeted year on year since 2007. Crime figures from 2011 show there were 19.2 firearm crimes per 100,000 population in Greater Manchester‚Äîcompared to 35.1 in the Metropolitan Police area and City of London, and 34.3 in the West Midlands. The Canal Street area of the city is well known as the \\"Gay Village\\". Manchester's claim to the status of \\"gay capital of the UK\\" was strengthened in 2003 when it played host city to the annual Europride festival. During the 1980s, the Victoria University of Manchester had somewhat complacently exploited its reputation as one of the leading red brick universities. During the same period, many of those universities established post-war vigorously pursued policies of growth and innovation. The university consequently saw its standing decline and only in the 1990s did it embark on a catch-up programme. In October 2004 the Victoria University of Manchester and UMIST merged to form the University of Manchester, the largest University in the UK with ambitious plans to be one of the world's leading research-intensive universities. Since the regeneration after the 1996 IRA bomb, and aided by the XVII Commonwealth Games, Manchester's city centre has changed significantly. Large sections of the city dating from the 1960s have been either demolished and re-developed or modernised with the use of glass and steel; a good example of this transformation is the Manchester Arndale. Many old mills and textile warehouses have been converted into apartments, helping to give the city a much more modern, upmarket look and feel. Some areas, like Hulme, have undergone extensive regeneration programmes and many million-pound lofthouse apartments have since been developed to cater for its growing business community. The 168 metre tall, 47-storey Beetham Tower, completed in 2006, provides the highest residential accommodation in the United Kingdom‚Äîthe lower 23 floors form the Hilton Hotel, while the upper 24 floors are apartments. The Beetham Tower was originally planned to stand 171 metres in height, but this had to be changed due to local wind conditions. In January 2007, the independent Casino Advisory Panel awarded Manchester a licence to build the only supercasino in the UK to regenerate the Eastlands area of the city, ‚Ä¢ but in March the House of Lords rejected the decision by three votes rendering previous House of Commons acceptance meaningless. This left the supercasino, and 14 other smaller concessions, in parliamentary limbo until a final decision was made. On 11 July 2007, a source close to the government declared the entire supercasino project \\"dead in the water\\". A member of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce professed himself \\"amazed and a bit shocked\\" and that \\"there has been an awful lot of time and money wasted\\". After a meeting with the Prime Minister, Manchester City Council issued a press release on 24 July 2007 stating that \\"contrary to some reports the door is not closed to a regional casino\\". The supercasino was officially declared dead in February 2008 with a compensation package described by the Manchester Evening News as \\"rehashed plans, spin and empty promises.\\" Parts of the city centre were affected by rioting by Rangers fans during the 2008 UEFA Cup Final riots. As of 2011, Manchester and Salford are on a tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage Site status. The proposal centres on the Bridgewater Canal, regarded as the first true canal which helped create the industrial revolution. On Tuesday 9 August, the centres of Manchester and Salford were affected by the 2011 England riots. On 22 May 2017, an Islamic terrorist carried out a suicide bombing following a concert by the American singer Ariana Grande at the Manchester Arena. The bomb killed 23, including the attacker, and injured over 800 with many being children and teenagers. It was the deadliest terrorist attack and the first suicide bombing in Britain since the 7 July 2005 London bombings. The attack caused worldwide condemnation and the changing of the UK's threat level to \\"critical\\" for the first time since 2007. Many of the injured and dead were from the Greater Manchester area and neighbouring parts of Cheshire and Lancashire. Civic history The town of Manchester (as it was then) was granted a charter in 1301 by Thomas de Grelley, Baron of Manchester, who was also the Lord of the Manor of Manchester. Until the 19th century, Manchester was one of the many townships in the ancient parish of Manchester which covered a wider area than today's metropolitan borough. In 1792 commissioners, usually known as police commissioners, were established for the improvement of the Township of Manchester. By the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, the Borough of Manchester was established in 1838 as a local authority, which included the areas of Manchester, Beswick, Cheetham, Chorlton-on-Medlock and Hulme townships. On 11 December 1840, the Manchester Poor Law Union was formally declared and took responsibility for the administration and funding of the Poor Law in the area. =City of Manchester= In 1853 the Borough was elevated to city status. In 1885 further areas were added to the City of Manchester with Bradford, Harpurhey, Rusholme and parts of Moss Side and Withington townships. By the Local Government Act 1888, the City of Manchester became in 1889 a county borough, although it still kept the city title. Other areas, which had been under the control of Lancashire County Council, were added to the city between 1890 and 1933: * 1890: Blackley, Crumpsall, Moston, Openshaw and Newton (incl. Kirkmanshulme) townships, Clayton area (part of Droylsden township) and part of Gorton township. * 1901: A very small part of Gorton Urban District. * 1903: Part (Heaton Park area) of Prestwich Urban District. * 1904: Burnage, Didsbury and Chorlton-cum-Hardy civil parishes and Moss Side and Withington Urban Districts. * 1909: Levenshulme Urban District and the remaining area of Gorton Urban District. * 1913: Part of Heaton Norris Urban District. * 1933: Part of Denton Urban District. * In addition to these areas, in 1931 the Cheshire civil parishes of Baguley, Northenden and Northen Etchells were also added to the City of Manchester. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the City of Manchester, with the addition of the civil parish of Ringway, became on 1 April 1974 one of the ten Metropolitan Boroughs of the newly created Metropolitan County of Greater Manchester. In 1986 Greater Manchester County Council was abolished by the Local Government Act 1985 and most of its functions were devolved to the ten boroughs, making them effectively unitary authorities. Some of the County Council's functions were taken over by joint bodies such as a passenger transport authority, and joint fire, police and waste disposal authorities. In one of its most noted acts, Manchester City Council carried a resolution in 1980 to create the UK's first Nuclear Free Zone The Peace Gardens were later constructed on a small piece of land in St. Peters Square. Greater Manchester Before 1974 the area of Greater Manchester was split between Cheshire and Lancashire with numerous parts being independent county boroughs. The area was informally known as \\"SELNEC\\", for \\"South East Lancashire North East Cheshire\\". Also, small parts of the West Riding of Yorkshire (around Saddleworth) and Derbyshire were covered. SELNEC had been proposed by the Redcliffe-Maud Report of 1969 as a \\"metropolitan area\\". This had roughly the same northern boundary as today's Greater Manchester but covered much more territory in north-east Cheshire ‚Äì including Macclesfield and Warrington. It also covered Glossop in Derbyshire. In 1969 a SELNEC Passenger Transport Authority was set up, which covered an area smaller than the proposed SELNEC, but different from the eventual Greater Manchester. Although the Redcliffe-Maud report was rejected by the Conservative Party government after it won the 1970 general election, it was committed to local government reform and accepted the need for a county based on Manchester. Its original proposal was much smaller than the Redcliffe-Maud Report's SELNEC, but further fringe areas such as Wilmslow, Warrington and Glossop were trimmed from the edges and included instead in the shire counties. The metropolitan county of Greater Manchester was eventually established in 1974. Greater Manchester's representative county council was abolished in 1986, following the Local Government Act 1985. However, Greater Manchester is still a metropolitan county and ceremonial county.

The Snares consist of the main North East Island and the smaller Broughton Island as well as the Western Chain Islands some to the west-southwest. Collectively, the Snares have a total land area of . The islands are listed with the New Zealand Outlying Islands. The islands are an immediate part of New Zealand, not part of any region or district, but instead Area Outside Territorial Authority, like all the other outlying islands except the Solander Islands. History The island group was first sighted by Europeans on 23 November 1791 independently by the two ships HMS Discovery under Captain George Vancouver, and HMS Chatham, commanded by Lieutenant William R. Broughton, both of the Vancouver Expedition. Vancouver named the islands \\"The Snares\\" because he considered them a shipping hazard; an islet east of the Western Chain bears the name Vancouver Rock, and the second largest island is named after Broughton. The islands were already known to the MƒÅori, who called one of the larger islands Te Taniwha (\\"The sea-monster\\"). Unlike other subantarctic islands that were greatly affected by the whaling and sealing industry in the 19th century, the Snares remain one of the last pristine areas in New Zealand. The Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998 officially altered the name to \\"Snares Islands/Tini Heke\\" ‚Äì one of many such changes under the NgƒÅi Tahu Treaty settlement. Geography The main island of the Snares group, North East Island, as its name suggests, lies at the northeastern corner of the group. It has roughly the shape of a triangle, but with two concave edges, this causing both the southern and northwestern coast to be in the form of large irregular bays. Cliffs and reefs are found along the northeastern coast and part of the southern coast, with the islands highest point ‚Äì rising to 130 metres ‚Äì being located on the long westward-pointing finger which lies between them. In contrast, the east coast is relatively flat and sloping, and provides the only easy access-point for landing, close to Station Point. Several small bays dot the east coast, among them Punui Bay, Ho Ho Bay, and Mollymawk Bay. The island's northernmost and southernmost points are the prosaically named North Promontory and South Promontory. Several small islets, the Daption Rocks, lie off the tip of North Promontory, and are the island group's northernmost point.NZMS 272/1+5 (1981) \\"Snares Islands and Bounty Islands\\", Wellington:NZ Government Department of Lands and Surveys. The group's second largest island, Broughton Island, lies to the southeast of South Promontory. Steeply sloping, it is surrounded by cliffs, reefs and small islets on three sides, with only the northern side being relatively accessible. The long finger on the western coast of the main island has several small islands located close to its tip. The largest of these, Alert Stack, is located to the south of the peninsula and separated from it by a narrow channel. The peninsula points almost directly towards the Western Chain, a line of stacks located some 4 kilometres to the southwest of the main island. These islets are simply named Tahi, Rua, Toru, Wha, and Rima, the MƒÅori words for the numerals one to five. Between this chain and North East island lies the small stack of Vancouver Rock. Environment The islands provide a home to endemic bird species, such as the Snares penguin (Eudyptes robustus), the Snares snipe (Coenocorypha huegli) and Snares tomtit (Petroica macrocephala dannefaerdi), as well as to several endemic invertebrates such as Grypotheca horningae. North East Island is forested and is the world's premier breeding area for the sooty shearwaters (Ardenna grisea), with up to three million individuals being present during the breeding season (November‚ÄìApril). A dangerous reef (Seal Reef) lies ten kilometres to the south of the group. Megaherb communities grow on the islands. The islands enjoy a status of high protection and are rated by the New Zealand Department of Conservation as \\"minimum impact islands\\". Landing on the islands is generally prohibited or by special research permit only. The area is among one of five subantarctic island groups forming the New Zealand Subantarctic Islands, designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.New Zealand Sub-Antarctic Islands - UNESCO World Heritage Centre See also * List of Antarctic and subantarctic islands * List of islands of New Zealand * List of islands * Desert island References  External links  * TerraNature - Snares crested penguin and island images * Birds Of the Snares Islands - New Zealand * Info and Map of the Snares Islands - New Zealand Department of Conservation * Expedition Snares Islands video ‚Äì Te Papa Category:New Zealand subantarctic islands Category:Archipelagoes of New Zealand Category:Archipelagoes of the Southern Ocean Category:Subantarctic islands ","title":"Snares Islands / Tini Heke"},{"id":"1139590","text":"Vivendi SA is a French media conglomerate headquartered in Paris. Widely known as the owner of Universal Music Group, Groupe Canal+ and Dailymotion, the company has activities in music, television, film, video games, book publishing, tickets and video hosting services.  History  = Origins = Original Vivendi logo On 14 December 1853, a water company named Compagnie G√©n√©rale des Eaux (CGE) was created by an imperial decree of Napoleon III. In 1854, CGE obtained a concession in order to supply water to the public in Lyon, serving in that capacity for over a hundred years. In 1861, it obtained a 50-year concession with the City of Paris.History CGE-Vivendi-Veolia Environment 1853-1900 CGE also supplied water to Nantes, Venice (from 1880), Constantinople (from 1882) and Porto (from 1883). For more than a century, Compagnie G√©n√©rale des Eaux remained largely focused on the water sector. Following the appointment of Guy Dejouany as CEO in 1976, CGE extended its activities into other sectors with a series of takeovers. Beginning in 1980, CGE began diversifying its operations from water into waste management, energy, transport services, and construction and property. It acquired the Compagnie G√©n√©rale d'Entreprises Automobiles (CGEA), specialized in industrial vehicles, which was later divided into two branches: Connex (later Veolia Transport) in 1999 and Onyx Environnement (later Veolia Environmental Services) in 1989. CGE then acquired the Compagnie G√©n√©rale de Chauffe, and later the Montenay group, with these companies later becoming the Energy Services division of CGE, and later renamed \\"Dalkia\\" in 1998. In 1983, CGE helped to found Canal+, the first pay-TV channel in France, and in the 1990s, they began expanding into telecommunications and mass media, especially after Jean-Marie Messier succeeded Guy Dejouany on 27 June 1996, acquiring companies such as the Babelsberg Studio. In 1996, CGE created Neuf Cegetel to take advantage of the 1998 deregulation of the French telecommunications market, accelerating the move into the media sector which would culminate in the 2000 demerger into Vivendi Universal and Vivendi Environnement (Veolia).History CGE-Vivendi-Veolia Environment 1950-2000 = Creation of \\"Vivendi\\" = Vivendi Universal logo from 2000 to 2006 In 1998, Compagnie G√©n√©rale des Eaux changed its name to Vivendi, and sold off its property and construction divisions the following year to what would become Vinci SA. Vivendi went on to acquire stakes in or merge with Maroc Telecom, Havas, Cendant Software, Grupo Anaya, and NetHold, a large Continental European pay-TV operator. Beginning in 1998, Vivendi launched digital channels in Italy, Spain, Poland, Scandinavia, Belgium, and the Netherlands. In June 1999, Vivendi merged with Path√©, the exchange ratio for the merger fixed at three Vivendi shares for every two Path√© shares. The Wall Street Journal estimated the value of the deal at US$2.59 billion. Following the completion of the merger, Vivendi retained Path√©'s interests in British Sky Broadcasting Group PLC and CanalSatellite, a French broadcasting corporation, then sold all remaining assets to J√©r√¥me Seydoux's family-owned holding company, Fornier SA, who changed its name to Path√©. Vivendi Universal SA was created on 8 December 2000 with the merger of the Vivendi media empire with Canal+ television networks and the acquisition of media assets of Canadian company Seagram Company Ltd, owner of Universal Studios. Vivendi Universal acquired MP3.com and a leading American publisher, Houghton Mifflin in year 2001. To raise the funds, Vivendi Universal sold its trade and medical publishing businesses to a group led by Cinven. Vivendi Environnement Vivendi Environnement was formed in 1999 by Vivendi to consolidate its environmental divisions, which were CGEA Transport, Onyx Environnement (now Veolia Environmental Services), Dalkia and CGE water division. As a result, CGEA Transport was renamed Connex (later Veolia Transport), and CGE's water division was renamed Vivendi Water (now Veolia Water). In July 2000, Vivendi Environnement was divested through IPOs in Paris and later New York in October 2001. Initially, Vivendi Universal retained a 70% stake in Vivendi Environnement in 2000, but by December 2002, it was reduced to 20.4%. In 2003, Vivendi Environnement was renamed to Veolia Environnement. = Corporate loss = Vivendi Universal disclosed a corporate loss of ‚Ç¨23.3 billion in its 2002 annual report. It responded with financial reshuffling, trying to shore up media holdings while selling off shares in its spin-off companies. Amid intense media scrutiny, its chairman and CEO, Jean- Marie Messier (who had overseen the most dramatic phase of the company's diversification), was subsequently replaced by Jean-Ren√© Fourtou. Messier was found guilty of embezzlement in 2011, but not before he was paid over US$20 million as part of his severance package. The company reduced its stake in Vivendi Environnement to 40% and sold its stake in Vinci SA. The company then began reorganizing to stave off bankruptcy, announcing a strategy to sell non- strategic assets. Its largest single shareholder was the family of Edgar Bronfman Jr., who was head of Seagram at the time of the merger. Vivendi sold its stake in Vizzavi to Vodafone, with the exception of Vizzavi France. It also sold 20.4% of Vivendi Environnement's capital to a group of investors, and its stake in North American satellite operator EchoStar Communications Corporation. It also sold its European book publishing to Lagard√®re. It also sold Houghton Mifflin to Thomas H Lee, Blackstone and Bain consortium for US$1.66 billion. Also in 2002, Vivendi Universal sold the Belgian and Dutch activities of its subsidiary Scoot Europe to Kapitol, the parent company of online directory Infobel. In 2003, Vivendi Universal sold Canal+ Technologies to Thomson SA; Tele+ to News Corporation and Telecom Italia. It also sold its 26.3% interest in Xfera. Also in 2003, it sold its consumer magazines to Socpresse and its free newspapers to France Antilles. On 1 December, Vivendi Universal closed a deal to sell MP3.com to CNET. Despite predictions that it would be unable to raise the cash needed, Vivendi Universal bought out one of the two minority shareholders in Cegetel, taking its holding to 60 percent, with Vodafone holding the remaining 40 percent. Management viewed the mobile communications firm as a core asset once the bulk of media assets had been sold off. = Further acquisitions, mergers and divestments = In 2004, 80% of the Vivendi Universal subsidiary was sold to GE, to form NBC Universal, with Vivendi retaining a 20 percent stake. At the same time, it sold a 50% stake in Canal+ and StudioCanal to the new company. Vivendi also sold its interests in Kencell (re-branded Celtel, Kenya), Monaco Telecom and Sportfive (which it held through Canal+ Group), and sold Newsworld International to the business partnership of Joel Hyatt and former Vice-President of the United States Al Gore. Vivendi also sold Babelsberg Studio. On 16 December 2005, it was announced that Canal Plus would merge with TPS, France's second largest Pay-TV provider. If the ‚Ç¨5 billion (US$5.9 billion; ¬£3.4 bn) tie-up is approved, VU will own 85% of the combined entity. On 17 January 2006, Vivendi Universal announced it would end its American Depositary Receipt program and its listing on the New York Stock Exchange by the end of the second quarter of 2006, due to lowered trading volume on its shares and high costs. On 20 April 2006, Vivendi in its current form came into existence, following the sale of an 80% stake in the Vivendi Universal unit to General Electric to form NBC Universal (merging GE's NBC unit and Vivendi's Vivendi Universal unit) and the gradual recovery of the company from its disastrous over-expansion in the late 1990s and the early 2000s. The company announced that shareholders had approved the name change to \\"Vivendi\\". In August 2006, Vivendi signed a deal with Spiralfrog to distribute Vivendi's songs online in the United States and Canada. On 8 September, the company announced that Sierra Entertainment would be publishing the new game for Double Fine Productions, later revealed to be Br√ºtal Legend. On 2 December 2007, Vivendi announced that it would be merging its game publishing unit with Activision in a $18.8 billion deal.Video game giants in $18bn merger - BBCGuitar Hero meets Warcraft in Vivendi-Activision deal - Reuters This will allow the merged company, Activision Blizzard, to rival Electronic Arts, the world's biggest video games publisher. The merger closed on 9 July 2008, for $9.8 billion. Vivendi held a 52% majority stake in the new business. On 8 September 2009, Vivendi announced negotiations to buy the Brazilian phone operator Global Village Telecom (GVT). Vivendi took control of GVT at a cost of 56 reais per share, on 13 November, trumping Telef√≥nica's bid. On 3 December 2009, GE announced it would purchase Vivendi's stake in NBC Universal, which would become a joint venture between GE and Comcast. Vivendi sold its stake in NBC Universal on 25 January 2011. On 4 April 2011, Vodafone sold its 44% stake in mobile service provider SFR to Vivendi for about $11 billion and giving Vivendi full control of its largest unit. In 2012, Vivendi announced having entered a strategic review of its assets and decided to refocus its activities on media and content activities while maximizing its telecoms assets. On 25 July 2013, Vivendi asset Activision Blizzard announced the purchase of 429 million shares from Vivendi for $5.83 billion, dropping the shareholder from a 63% stake to 11.8% by the end of the deal in September, ending Vivendi's majority ownership of Activision Blizzard. In November 2013, Vivendi also sold its 53% stake in Maroc Telecom to Dubai-based Etisalat for around $4.2 billion. Vivendi also confirmed in November 2013 its intention to launch a demerger plan which would result in Vivendi becoming an international media group consisting primarily of Canal+, Universal Music Group and GVT, while SFR would be listed separately on the stock market. As a result of the foregoing, Vivendi group results for the first semester 2014 are in a strong growth, witnessing the success of its repositioning strategy. Net income was up 84,8% to ‚Ç¨1.9 billion. In August 2014 Vivendi sells GVT to Telef√¥nica Vivo, a subsidiary of Telef√≥nica in Brazil. The moves have allowed Vivendi to rapidly pay down debt and increase cash returns to shareholders while leaving it with ammunition to do acquisitions of its own. Indeed, once the SFR deal closes, Vivendi will have a cash pile of around ‚Ç¨5 billion, leaving it with some room to maneuver even after it pays down debt and returns nearly ‚Ç¨5 billion in dividends and share buybacks to shareholders. Vivendi's priority is now content. The French group is expected to expand its assets in the content industries in the coming year. In 2014, Vivendi decided to sell mobile companies SFR (France) to Patrick Drahi's company, Altice, and GVT (Brazil) to the Brazilian company Telef√¥nica Vivo. On 28 May 2014, Vivendi sold half of its remaining shares (nearly 41.5 million shares) in Activision Blizzard for $850 million, reducing its stake to 6%. In April 2015, it was announced that a shareholder in the company Bollor√© raised its stake from 10.2 percent to 12.01 percent for a total fee of ‚Ç¨568 million. In 2015, Vivendi bought 80% share in Dailymotion. According to the Wall Street Journal, the \\"French media group offered around $273 million for streaming service\\". Vivendi was in talks with Orange, to Buy 80% stake in Dailymotion. Also, Vivendi announced extra payouts in compromise with P. Schoenfeld Asset Management shareholder. It was revealed in October 2015 that Vivendi would increase its stake in Telecom Italia to around 19% of the ordinary share capital as part of its aims to increase its influence in the group. As of May 2017, Vivendi owns 24.6% of the company with Vivendi's CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine becoming Executive Chairman of Telecom Italia. In October 2015, Vivendi bought minority stakes in the French video game studios Gameloft and Ubisoft. On 17 December 2015, Vivendi acquired a 64.4% majority stake in Belgian online radio aggregator Radionomy (including its media player platform Winamp and internet radio streaming software Shoutcast). Its shareholders, including its employees and U.S.-based investment firm Union Square Ventures, however, retained their stakes in the company. In June 2016, after having triggered a mandatory tender offer in February 2016 by reaching 30% ownership, and then becoming its largest shareholder, Vivendi completed a hostile takeover of Gameloft with the acquisition of its founders' stake. At the same time, Vivendi also further increased its stake in Ubisoft, which had led to concern from the company's management that Vivendi was also planning a hostile takeover of Ubisoft, however as of 2018 Vivendi is no longer in the position to do so. Vivendi (once the owner of Blizzard, later Activision Blizzard), searching for a new games publisher property has started investing in both Ubisoft and Gameloft. The brothers in charge of Ubisoft and Gameloft, Yves Guillemot and Michel Guillemot respectively, view the investments as a hostile takeover attempt, and are raising capital from within the family and from Canadian investors to maintain control of the companies. As of 8 June 2016, Vivendi has acquired a controlling stake in Gameloft. In news from 11 September 2016 Yves Guillemot is set to buy an additional 3.5% of Ubisoft shares to raise his stake to 12.5% to attempt to block a takeover from Vivendi. Yves has been attempting to lobby other shareholders to prevent them selling their shares to Vivendi. As of 20 March 2018, Vivendi has sold all its shares in Ubisoft and Tencent has bought in in their place. In an auction on 6 June, Vivendi won a bid to acquire Flavorus from SFX Entertainment for $4 million. Also that month, it acquired Paddington and Company Limited-owner of Paddington Bear and other properties, and The Copyrights Group. Vivendi declared that it owned 12.3% of Mediaset in December 2016. In January 2019, Vivendi completed its ‚Ç¨900 million acquisition of Editis, one of France's major book publishers. At the end of the first quarter of 2020, Vivendi completed a partial sale of Universal Music Group to a consortium led by Tencent, a Chinese media conglomerate. The amount of stake of the world's largest record label group that has been sold to the consortium is 10% and the valuation of which was $3.3 billion. The Tencent-led consortium retained an option to purchase another 10% at the same valuation until January 2021. Vivendi is also said to be eyeing an IPO of the music group by 2023 at the latest. In April 2020, Vivendi bought a 10.6% stake in Lagard√®re Group, another French media group. The investment was made at the time when Lagard√®re, the assets of which include the world's third-largest book publisher Hachette, is faced with attacks from a group of fierce and well- funded activist investors, and a year after Vivendi completed its takeover of Editis, the smaller domestic book publisher. By August, Vivendi has doubled its stake in Lagard√®re to 23.5%, becoming the largest shareholder of the rival group.

It is a land-locked county that was several times the seat of Parliament. From origins in brewing and papermaking, through aircraft manufacture, the county has developed a wider range of industry in which pharmaceuticals, financial services and film- making are prominent. Today, with a population slightly over 1 million, Hertfordshire services, industry and commerce dominate the economy, with fewer than 2000 people working in agriculture, forestry and fishing. Hertfordshire is one of the historic counties of England first recorded in the early 10th century. Its development has been tied with that of London, which lies on its southern border. London is the largest city in Western Europe; it requires an enormous tonnage of supplies each day and Hertfordshire grew wealthy on the proceeds of trade because no less than three of the old Roman roads serving the capital run through it, as do the Grand Union Canal and other watercourses. In the 19th century, rail links sprang up in the county, linking London to the north. Hatfield in Hertfordshire has seen two rail crashes of international importance (in 1870 and 2000). Though nowadays Hertfordshire tends to be politically conservative, historically it was the site of a number of uprisings against the Crown, particularly in the First Barons' War, the Peasants' Revolt, the Wars of the Roses and the English Civil War. The county has a rich intellectual history, and many writers of major importance, from Geoffrey Chaucer to Beatrix Potter, have connections there. Quite a number of Prime Ministers were born or grew up in Hertfordshire. The county contains a curiously large number of abandoned settlements, which K. Rutherford Davis attributes to a mixture of poor harvests on soil hard to farm, and the Black Death which ravaged Hertfordshire starting in 1349. Early history The earliest evidence of human occupation in Hertfordshire come from a gravel pit in Rickmansworth. The finds (of flint tools) date back 350,000 years,Rook 1984, p. 20. long before Britain became an island. Beech Bottom Dyke constructed at the end of the Iron Age People have probably lived in the land now called Hertfordshire for about 12,000 years, since the Mesolithic period\\"The Early Mesolithic Period\\" , Hertfordshire County Council, retrieved 9 August 2009. in Ware (making Ware one of the oldest continuously occupied sites in Europe).\\"Ware - The Story so Far \\" , Ware Online, retrieved 20 December 2012. Settlement continued through the Neolithic period, with evidence of occupation sites, enclosures, long barrows and even an unusual dog cemetery in the region.Williamson 2000, p. 23.Castleden 1992, pp. 123-126 Although occupied, the area had a relatively low population in the Neolithic and early Bronze Age, perhaps because of its heavy, relatively poorly drained soil.Williamson 2000, p. 24. Nevertheless, just south of present-day Ware and Hertford there is some evidence of an increase in the population, with typical round huts and farming activity having been found at a site called Foxholes Farm.Kiln & Partridge 1994, p. 18. There is no evidence of settlement at Hertford itself from this period,Kiln & Partridge 1994, p. 23. although Ware and perhaps Hertford seem to have been occupied during Roman times.Kiln & Partridge 1994, pp. 28-62. In the Iron Age, a Celtic tribe called the Catuvellauni occupied Hertfordshire. Their main settlement (or oppidum) was Verlamion on the River Ver (near present-day St Albans). Other oppida in Hertfordshire include sites at Cow Roast near Tring, Wheathampstead, Welwyn, Braughing, and Baldock.Williamson 2000, p. 37. Hertfordshire contains several Iron Age hill forts, including the largest example in Eastern England at Ravensburgh Castle in Hexton.\\"Tribes and Chieftains: The Iron Age\\" , Hertfordshire County Council, retrieved 9 August 2009. There is a wealth of Iron Age burial sites in Hertfordshire, making it a place of international importance in Iron Age study. The large number of sites of all types indicates dense and complex settlement patterns immediately prior to the Roman invasion.Cuncliffe 2005, p. 163. =The Roman Invasion of Britain= The Devil's Dyke, probably the site of Caesar's defeat of the Catuvellauni In 55 BCE when the Romans first attempted to invade Britain, the Catuvellauni (which is Brythonic for \\"Expert Warrior\\") were the largest British tribe.Shields 2010, p. 13. Caesar's report to the Senate said that \\"Cassivellaun\\" (Cassivellaunus) was leader of the Britons, and Cassivellaunus' headquarters were near Wheathampstead in Hertfordshire.Shields 2010, p. 17. On Caesar's second invasion attempt in 54 BCE, Cassivellaunus led the British defensive forces. The Romans besieged him at Wheathampstead, and partly because of the defection of the Trinovantes (whose King Cassivellaunus had had murdered), the Catuvellauni were forced to surrender.Shields 2010, p. 18. However, after the siege of Wheathampstead, Caesar returned to Rome without leaving a garrison. Cunobelinus became king of the Catuvellauni in 9 or 10 CE and ruled for about thirty years,\\"British History Timeline\\", BBC, retrieved 5 May 2010. conquering such a large area of Britain that the Roman writer Suetonius called him Britannorum Rex ( \\"King of Britain\\"). He built Beech Bottom Dyke, a defensive earthwork, at St Albans,Cunliffe 2005, p. 161. which may be related to another Iron Age defensive earthwork, the Devil's Dyke, at Cassivellaunus' headquarters in nearby Wheathampstead. The Romans defeated the Catuvellauni again in July 43 CERobinson 1978, p. 3. and this time, garrisoned Britain. When the Romans took over, their settlement, laid out in 49 CE,Robinson 1978, p. 4. became known as Verulamium. Alban, a Roman army officer who became Britain's first Christian martyr after his arrest at Chantry Island, died in the 3rd or 4th century and gave his name to the modern town of St Albans. Verulamium became one of Roman Britain's major cities, the third-largest and the only to be granted self-governing status.Darvill et al. 2002, pp. 262-263 Strong though Verulamium's defences may have been, they were not enough to stop Boudica, who burned the city in 61 CE.Williamson 2000, p. 48. Verulamium was rebuilt, with defences enclosing a site of some and was occupied into the 5th century. A number of Roman Roads run through Hertfordshire including Watling Street and Ermine Street. The ancient trackway, the Icknield Way also runs through Hertfordshire. These are three of the \\"four highways\\" of medieval England (the other being the Fosse Way, which does not run through Hertfordshire) which were still the main routes through the country more than a thousand years later. The first Roman Road to be built was the Military Way, constructed very early in the Roman conquest to speed the troops' access north. Later, Ermine Street would be built directly on top of it.Kiln & Partridge 1994, p. 41. =Hertfordshire in the Early Middle Ages= After the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain, the Hertfordshire area formed parts of the Kingdom of Mercia and the Kingdom of Essex.Williamson 2000, p. 85. The main early Saxon tribes there seem to have been the Hicce, Brahhingas and W√¶clingas.Williamson 2000, p. 64. Place names tend to derive from Celtic rather than Saxon, and there is a \\"singular lack of Early Saxon place names.\\"Kiln & Partridge 1994, p. 63. The Synod of Hertford, which was the first national Synod of the English Church, took place on 26 September 672‚Äì3.Robinson 1978, p. 7. It was at this Synod that the \\"question of Easter\\" was settled, and the church agreed how to calculate the date of Easter. The Synod also marked the end of the conflict between the Celtic Church and the Romanised church introduced by Saint Augustine.Page 1959, p. 16. King Offa of Mercia (died 796) built a church at Hitchin in Hertfordshire, but it burned down in 910 CE and the monks moved to St Albans.Shields 2010, p. 20. Offa defeated Beornred of Mercia at Pirton, near Hitchin and gave his name to the village of Offley (\\"Offa's Lea\\").Lydekker 1909, p. 78. Some sources (including Matthew Paris, who was a monk at St Albans) suggest he died at Offley, though he was buried fifteen miles away in Bedford.Keynes 1991, p. 133. One of Offa's last acts was to found St Albans Abbey.Shields 2010, p. 25. =Origins of the county= Great Britain The word Hertfordshire (Saxon \\"Heorotfordscir\\" or \\"Heorotfordsc√≠r\\") is attested from 866.Shields 2010, p. 26. The first reference (as \\"Heoroford\\") in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is for 1011,Robinson 1978, p. 12. but the county's true origins lie in the 10th century, when Edward the Elder established two burhs in Hertford in 912 and 913 respectively.Williamson 2000, p. 90. Hertfordshire did not exist in any practical sense in the late 9th century. In the war between Saxon and Norseman, Hertfordshire was on the front line. When, after the Saxon victory in the Battle of Ethandun in 878, the Saxon King Alfred the Great and Norse King Guthrum the Old agreed to partition England between them, the dividing line between their territories split what was to become Hertfordshire almost through the middle, along the line of the River Lea and then along Watling Street. Their agreement survives in the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum which establishes the Danelaw's extent. It seems the land now comprising Hertfordshire was then partly in the Kingdom of Essex (nominally under Norse control, though still populated by Saxons) and partly in the Kingdom of Mercia (which remained Saxon). Alfred was also responsible for building weirs on the River Lea at Hertford (Saxon \\"Heorotford\\", ford used by deer) and Ware (Saxon \\"Waras\\", weir), presumably to prevent Viking ships coming upriver. King Edgar the Peaceful is credited with making Hertford the capital of the surrounding shire,Page 1959, p. 19. presumably between 973 and 975 CE. Early Middle Ages Alfred died in 899, and his son Edward the Elder worked with Alfred's son-in-law, √Üthelred, and daughter, √Üthelfl√¶d, to re-take parts of southern England from the Norse. During these campaigns he built the two burhs of Hertford as already noted. Their sites have not been found, and probably lie beneath the streets of Hertford itself.Williamson 2000, p. 92. From Hertford, together with Stafford, Tamworth and Witham, Edward and √Üthelfl√¶d pushed the Danes back to Northumbria in a series of battles. Anglo-Saxon Hertford is an example of town planning as demonstrated by its organised rectangular grid street pattern.\\"The Later Anglo-Saxon Period\\" , Hertfordshire County Council, retrieved 31 July 2009. There is considerable evidence of a mint in Hertford at this period. Edward the Martyr (from 975 to 978), √Üthelred the Unready (from 978 to 1016) and Knut the Great (from 1016 to 1035) all had coins struck there.Robinson 1978, p. 11. The mint itself has not been found, but many coins exist. Over 90% of these coins were found on the Continent or in Scandinavia, which may suggest they were used for payment of Danegeld.Kiln & Partridge 1994, appendices. The St Brice's Day massacre of 1002 probably started at Welwyn in Hertfordshire. The massacre was to be a slaughter of the Norse in England, including women and children. One of those executed was Gunhilde, the sister of King Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark. He invaded England next year in retaliation.Stenton 1971, p. 380. Forkbeard's assault on England lasted ten years, until 1013, when √Üthelred fled to the continent. Forkbeard was crowned King of England on Christmas Day, but only reigned for five weeks before dying. √Üthelred returned briefly and unsuccessfully until 1016, at which time he was succeeded by Forkbeard's son Knut, who granted the Royal Manor of Hitchin to his second in command, Earl Tovi.Shields 2010, p. 29. High Middle Ages King Stephen, painted around 1620. After the Norman Invasion, Edgar the √Ütheling (the successor to Harold Godwinson) surrendered to William the Conqueror at Berkhamsted.Rook 1984, p. 33. William created the manor of Berkhamsted, and bestowed it on Robert, Count of Mortain, who was his half- brother. From Robert's son William de Mortain it passed to King Henry I, and is still owned by the Royal Family.Shields 2010, p. 34. Henry held court there in 1123.Shields 2010, p. 36.

The Norman church at St Albans Abbey was finished in 1088.Perkins 1903, p. 8. Hertfordshire had a conflicted relationship with the King during the High Middle Ages. Like most counties in the south-east,Bartlett 2000, p. 160. most of Hertfordshire was in private (i.e. non-royal) ownership during the High Middle Ages. Royal land comprised about 7% of the county's area. The first Earl of Hertford, Gilbert de Clare, was so titled in 1138. He bore one of the first two sets of heraldic arms in England:Bartlett 2000, p. 247. three gold chevrons on a red shield. His grandson Richard de Clare once offered King John ¬£100 in respect of legal proceedings concerning his inheritance,Bartlett 2000, p. 169. but then during the First Barons War he sided with the Barons against the King. Richard became one of the twenty-five Barons sworn to enforce the Magna Carta, for which he was excommunicated in 1215. Thomas Becket, who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1161, held the honour of Berkhamsted Castle from 1155 until 1163. King Henry II celebrated Christmas there in 1163.Shields 2010, p. 38. Around this time, motte-and-bailey castles were built in Great Wymondley, Pirton and Therfield. Watford was founded in the 12th century, probably as a result of a market and church set up there by the Abbot of St Albans.Slater & Goose 1992, p. 277. In 1130, the earliest Pipe Roll shows that King Henry I's Queen Consort Adeliza owned property in the county.Bartlett 2000, p. 43. The first draft of the Magna Carta was written at St Albans Abbey in 1213. It contained significant provisions still in force to this day, including the principle of habeas corpus (which was first invoked in court in 1305). Two years later, King John was in St Albans when he learned of the Archbishop of Canterbury's suspension.Robinson 1978, p. 24. Though John agreed to the Magna Carta, he did not adhere to it, and Hertfordshire was the main battlefield in the civil war that followed.Rook 1984, p. 39. On 16 December 1216, during the First Barons' War, Hertford Castle surrendered after a siege from Dauphin Louis (later Louis VIII of France), whom the English barons had invited to England to replace John as King.Bartlett 2000, p. 66. Berkhamsted Castle surrendered around the same time.Lydekker 1909, p. 81. In winter 1217, royalist forces plundered St Albans, took captives and extorted ¬£100 from the Abbot, who feared the Abbey would be burned.Bartlett 2000, p. 255. In 1261 King Henry III held parliament in the county. In 1295, another parliament was held in St Albans,Robinson 1978, p. 31. and in 1299, King Edward I gave Hertford Castle to his wife Margaret of France on her wedding day. Hertfordshire is largely on a clay sub- soil, and much of its land, though rich, is \\"heavy\\" and not well-suited to crop cultivation with a medieval plough.Slater & Goose 1992, p. 81. However, the county did grow good barley which later became important for the brewing trade.Slater & Goose 1992, p. 375. Hertfordshire developed more through commerce than through agriculture which drove most of England's economy during this period. In the High Middle Ages, the county was relatively urbanised by medieval standards, but because towns follow roads and Hertfordshire had many small roads rather than a few large ones, there was no large conurbation.Slater & Goose 1992, p.103. Commerce grew in Hertfordshire from the start of the 12th century;Slater & Goose 1992, p. 48. the number of markets and fairs rose steadily from about 1100 until the Black Death. During the 13th century, Hertfordshire's commerce grew still further. The county traded in butter and cheese, and to a lesser extent meat, hides and leather. Much of this produce was bound for London.Slater & Goose 1992, p. 53. The county also developed its inns and other services for travellers to and from London.Slater & Goose 1992, p. 63. The Knights Templar built Baldock, starting around 1140.Rook 1984, p. 60. In 1185, a survey of the Knights' holdings showed Baldock had 122 tenants on of landRobinson 1978, p. 20. and several skilled craftsmen. King John granted the Knights a fair and market at Baldock in 1199, to be held annually. It began on St Matthew's Day and lasted five days in all.Robinson 1978, p. 21-22. At around the same time, the leatherworking trade was prominent in Hitchin.\\"Later Middle Ages\\" , North Hertfordshire District Council, retrieved 3 May 2010. =An English pope= Nicholas Breakspear, the only Englishman ever to have been elected Pope, was born on a farm in BedmondShields 2010, p. 37. or Abbots LangleyRook 1984, p. 51. in Hertfordshire, probably around 1100. He was baptised in Abbots Langley. Nicholas was refused permission to become a monk at St Albans, but his career does not seem to have suffered for this, and he was unanimously elected Pope on 2 December 1154, taking the papal name Adrian IV. He died in 1159.Robinson 1978, p. 19. He was the Pope who placed Rome under an interdict, and is famous for his alleged Donation of Ireland to the English throne.Catholic Encyclopedia 1913, Pope Adrian IV Late Middle Ages In 1302, King Edward I granted Kings Langley to the Prince of Wales.Robinson 1978, p. 32. King Edward II's \\"favourite\\", Piers Gaveston, loved the palace at Kings Langley and he was buried there after his death in 1312. Edmund of Langley, the first Duke of York and founder of the House of York, was born in Kings Langley on 5 June 1341 and died there on 1 August 1402. King Edward I Richard of Wallingford, the mathematician and astronomer, became Abbott of St Albans in 1326.Chambers Biographical Dictionary, \\"Robert of Wallingford\\", p. 1127. He is regarded as the father of modern trigonometry. Hertford Castle was used as a gaol for a series of important captives during the Hundred Years' War. This was actually a series of separate wars that lasted a total of 116 years, between 1337 and 1453. The Plantagenet Kings of England fought the Valois Kings of France, almost entirely on French soil. Queen Isabella was imprisoned by her son, the King, in Hertford Castle in 1330,Robinson 1978, p. 34. as were King David II of Scotland and his queen in 1346, after the Battle of Neville's Cross. King John II of France was imprisoned there in 1359Robinson 1978, p. 38. in considerable luxury. The Black Death midway through the 14th century massively reduced Hertfordshire's population. The number of residents probably fell by 30%‚Äì50%, and likely took until the 16th century to recover. This meant many of the settlements in Hertfordshire were abandoned, particularly in the north and east of the county where farm yields were poor. Near Tring, a cluster of deserted medieval villages can still be seen. However, the residents who survived grew richer.Slater & Goose 1992, p. 61. The reduced population meant workers could demand higher wages and better conditions, despite laws such as the Ordinance of Labourers of 1349 and the Statute of Labourers of 1351.Dr Mike Ibeji, \\"Black Death: Political and Social Changes\\", BBC, retrieved 3 August 2009. These changed economic conditions contributed to the Peasants' Revolt in 1381, in which Hertfordshire's people were deeply involved.Lydekker 1909, p. 82. (Perhaps confusingly, another man called Richard of Wallingford was one of revolt leader Wat Tyler's principal allies. This is not the same man as the Abbott of St Albans.) After Wat Tyler had been caught and executed, King Richard II went to St Albans to quell the rebels. Richard's body was buried at Kings Langley church in Hertfordshire in 1400,Robinson 1978, p. 41. but he was moved to Westminster Abbey in 1413, next to his wife Anne. That same year, King Henry IV appointed his knight Hugh de Waterton to Berkhamsted Castle to supervise his children John and Philippa. Ye Olde Fighting Cocks, a fifteenth-century public house in St Albans King Henry IV moved his government temporarily to St Albans early in his reign for fear of public opinion in London.Slater & Goose 1992, p. 56. He gave the castle and honour of Hertford to Edmund, Earl of Stafford, and his wife Anne. Edmund was killed at the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403. King Henry IV married Catherine of France on 2 June 1420, and gave Hertford Castle to her.Robinson 1978, p. 43. In 1413, King Henry V kept Easter at Kings Langley. He gave the alm of a groat to the poor.Robinson 1978, p. 42. Henry Chichele, the Archbishop of Canterbury, visited Barnet in 1423. No bells rang, and the archbishop took offence at his poor welcome. When he returned in 1426, the church doors were sealed against him. Three important battles of the Wars of the Roses took place in Hertfordshire. At the First Battle of St Albans on 22 May 1455, which was the first major battle of the Wars of the Roses,Rook 1984, p. 67. Richard of York and Neville the Kingmaker defeated the Lancastrians, killed their leader, Edmund Beaufort and captured King Henry VI. The Lancastrians recaptured the King at the Second Battle of St Albans on 12 February 1461.Robinson 1978, p. 45. While he was a prisoner of the Yorkists, in 1459, Henry VI kept Easter at St Albans Abbey. He gave his best gown to the prior, but the gift seems to have been regretted and the treasurer later bought it back for fifty marks. The Battle of Barnet took place on 14 April 1471. Neville the Kingmaker advanced on London. He camped on Hadley Green, and King Edward IV's army met him there. After confusion in the early morning mist, in which the Yorkists seem to have ended up fighting each other, the Lancastrians won the battle. The Kingmaker was captured and executed, and Edward's authority was never again seriously challenged.Rook 1984, p. 72. England's oldest surviving pub is in Hertfordshire and dates to this period. Ye Olde Fighting Cocks, which is in St Albans, was rebuilt in 1485. Some of the foundation stones are even older, allegedly going back to the 8th century. ;First English paper and printing industry One of the first three printing presses in England was in St Albans.Feiling 1950, p. 272. England's first paper mill, which was the property of John Tate, stood in Hertford opposite today's County Hospital from 1494; visited by Henry VII twice and producing a star and circle watermark on some versions of the Papal Bull recognising his right to reign over England. Renaissance The long Elizabethan peace, and turmoil in Europe, conspired to raise English commercial power during the Renaissance.Feiling 1950, p. 511. European refugees also contributed to English wealth. London was the centre of this new power,Feiling 1950, p. 512. and Hertfordshire's commerce benefited accordingly. In November 1524, Catherine of Aragon held court at Hertford Castle.Robinson 1978, p. 49. On 3 May 1547, King Edward VI granted his sister Mary the manor and castle of Hertford, tolls from the bridge at Ware, and the manor of Hertingfordbury.Robinson 1978, p. 53. Under Mary, who as Queen earned the sobriquet \\"Bloody Mary\\", three \\"heretics\\" (that is, protestants who refused to become catholic) were burnt at the stake in Hertfordshire. William Hale, Thomas Fust, and George Tankerville, were executed at Barnet, Ware, and St Albans respectively. In 1554, Queen Mary granted the town of Hertford its first charter for a fee of thirteen shillings and fourpence, due annually at Michaelmas.Turnor 1830, p. 71. Queen Elizabeth I lived at Hatfield Palace near Hatfield as a girl. When plague ravaged London, she held parliaments at Hertford Castle\\"The Post-Medieval and Modern Periods\\" , Hertfordshire County Council, retrieved 31 July 2009. in 1564 and 1581.Lydekker 1909, p. 84. The law courts moved to St Albans for the same reason. During her reign, Hertfordshire was specifically commended for its soldiers' efficiency.Rook 1984, p. 83. In the mobilisation of 1588 for the Anglo-Spanish War, the county sent twenty-five lances and sixty light horse to Brentwood, a thousand infantry to Tilbury, a thousand to Stratford-at-Bow, and five hundred to guard Her Majesty's person. The Arms of Hertfordshire were granted next year.Rook 1984, p. 84. In 1602 founder of Hartford (Connecticut), Samuel Stone was born in Fore Street, Hertford. Amwell King James I was often in HertfordshireJones-Baker 1991, p. 93. and had several works carried out in the county. He built Theobalds Park, enclosing a large tract of southern Hertfordshire in a wall. Parts of the wall still exist. He also had a hand in creating the New River, which was the brainchild of Welsh entrepreneur, Hugh Myddelton: an artificial watercourse that predated the building of England's canal network by over a century. James I, who was a confirmed dog-lover, also built a huge kennel (about long) and dog-yard (over half an acre in size) at Royston.Jones-Baker 1991, p. 98. He seems to have loved Royston and spent considerable time there, hunting and feasting and enjoying himself‚Äîso much so that his favourite dog, Jowler, returned one evening with a note tied to his collar. The note read: \\"Good Mr Jowler, we pray you to speak to the King (for he hears you every day and so he doth not us) that it will please His Majesty to go back to London, for else the country will be undone; all our provision is spent already and we are not able to entertain him longer.\\"Quoted in Rook 1984, p. 79. During the civil war, the county was mainly parliamentarian. St Albans was an especially staunch parliamentary stronghold. In the course of this war, deserters and mutineers among the various encamped armies ravaged the Chilterns, plundered Ashridge, rifled Little Gaddesden Church and broke open its tombs. In 1645, a dozen men of Oliver Cromwell's New Model Army were hanged for outrages against the people of the county. In 1647, the parliamentary army, still unpaid after their victory in the First English Civil War, camped on Thriploe Heath near Royston. They wrote to Parliament demanding their pay. This led to a clash between Cromwell's army and the Levellers at Cockbush Field, near Ware, on 15 November 1647.Robinson 1992, p. 70. Cromwell captured and imprisoned the Levellers' \\"agitators\\" and a number were sentenced to death, though only one was actually executed.Rook 1984, p. 85. After the Great Fire of London, many children were sent to Hertfordshire: 62 were sent to Ware, and 56 to Hertford.Robinson 1978, p. 75 A few years later the mayor and people of Hertford petitioned King Charles II to confirm, amend and expand the town's charters.Jones-Baker 1991, p. 175. Enquiries were made as to whether anyone would object, and three prominent men did, but the attorney general dismissed their objections on grounds of malice in 1680.Jones-Baker 1991, p. 178. The town henceforth had its own coroner, who doubled as the town clerk, and both the court-day and market-day were changed so as not to coincide with nearby markets at Ware, Hoddesdon or Hatfield. In 1683, there was a plot to assassinate Charles II and his brother as he passed through Rye House in Hertfordshire. Unfortunately for the plotters, the Royal party was early, so the opportunity was missed; when the plot was discovered, it became a pretext for a purge of the Whig leaders. Modern era Map of Hertfordshire (with north to the right) in Gray's Book of Roads, George Carrington Gray (1824) In the last two centuries, Hertfordshire's population has multiplied tenfold. Around the end of the 18th century, its population was around 95,000.Tomkins 1922, p. 24. In 1821, it was just under 130,000. In 1881 it was just over 203,000, and by 1921 it was just over 333,000. By the 2001 census, it was 1,033,977.2001 Office for National Statistics, retrieved 4 August 2009. During the 18th century brewing became an important industry in Hertfordshire. Smallpox broke out in Hertford gaol in 1729, and spread into the town. The next year, smallpox hit Hitchin, killing 158 people.Robinson 1978, p. 83. The River Lea Navigation Act of 1739 led to the river being improved, becoming navigable as far as Ware. Locks were built in Ware, Broxbourne, and \\"Stanstead\\"Robinson 1978, p. 84. (presumably Stanstead Abbotts rather than Stansted Mountfitchet, which is not on the Lea). By 1797, the Grand Junction Canal (now called the Grand Union Canal) was being cut. Its highest point is the Tring Summit in Hertfordshire, which was formed in 1799.Rook 1984, p. 87. Because a canal barge can hold so much more than a wagon, the waterways expansions increased the quantity of supplies that could reach London (and the amount of refuse and manure that could be carted away). Mobilisation for the Seven Years' War affected Hertfordshire. In 1756, ¬£350 was paid to the inns and public houses of Ware for the troops staying with them.Robinson 1978, p. 86. The next year, Pitt's army reforms made Hertfordshire liable to provide 560 officers and men. The county also contributed soldiers to the French Revolutionary Wars. On 7 May 1794, lists opened for the Hertfordshire Yeomanry Cavalry Regiment, which comprised five troops of cavalry.Robinson 1978, p. 92. The Loyal Hemel Hempstead Volunteers formed in 1797.Robinson 1978, p. 93. Two further troops of volunteers were raised in 1798, at Borehamwood and Sawbridgeworth,Robinson 1978, p. 94. and the same year, the Hitchin Volunteers were also raised, but their duty was only to defend land within of Hitchin. In 1795, a Dr Walker wrote a report on agriculture and forestry in the county. He said \\"Herts is justly deemed the first and best corn county in the kingdom\\", an assessment that may not be free from local bias. It nevertheless shows how more advanced farming techniques and soil improvement programmes had enabled farmers to work Hertfordshire's \\"heavier\\" soils to better effect since the Saxon‚ÄìNorse wars. Thanks to a rapidly increasing population and improved record-keeping practices, the volume of paper records for Hertfordshire in the 19th and 20th centuries is huge. Many of these documents are written or printed on paper made locally, at a time when paper-making joined brewing as another dominant industry in the county. Berkhampstead Railway Station in 1838 In 1809, John Dickinson purchased Apsley Mills in Hemel Hempstead for his newly patented paper-making machine.Robinson 1978, p. 95. In a dispute with the Society of Paper-Makers in 1821, he dismissed the men involved and trained replacements.Robinson 1978, p. 98. By 1825, Apsley and Nash Mills in Hemel Hempstead were using steam power to produce paper.Robinson 1978, p. 99. Dickinson patented his silk threadpaper in 1829, which was used, among other things, for Exchequer Bonds, and had to be made under supervision from two excise men.Robinson 1978, p. 100. He built Croxley Mills, near Rickmansworth, in 1830 and Abbots Hill, Nash Mills, in 1836.Robinson 1978, p. 102. In 1840, the Uniform Penny Post came in. Dickinson made paper for the stamps, and also for the Mulready envelopes.Robinson 1978, p. 104. He built a private gas works at Apsley in 1851.Robinson 1978, p. 109. In March 1886, John Dickinson & Co. Ltd. was incorporated with ¬£500,000 in capital and of glass houses.Robinson 1978, p. 116. By 1900, the company had of glass houses in the Cheshunt area. Rothamsted Research, previously known as the Experimental Station and then the Institute of Arable Crops Research, is one of the oldest agricultural research institutions in the world, at its Harpenden site. It was founded by a fertiliser inventor in 1843. Hatfield House in 1880 The 19th century was also a busy period for the military. Ten corps of Volunteer Infantry were formed in 1803. In 1804, the clock tower in St Albans signalled news of the Battle of Trafalgar by semaphore. The Duke of Wellington earned the freedom of the borough of St Albans after Napoleon's defeat in 1814.Robinson 1978, p. 97. The Hertfordshire Regiment became the fourth battalion of the Bedfordshire Regiment in 1891,Robinson 1978, p. 118. and in March 1900, the 42nd (Hertfordshire) Company of the Imperial Yeomanry landed at Cape Town.Robinson 1978, p. 120. Cecil Rhodes, who founded De Beers and the state of Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), was born in South Street, Bishops Stortford, in 1853. The house is still standing, and has been adapted into a museum. He spent much of his youth in South Africa, but returned to Bishops Stortford in 1873.Robinson 1978, p. 114. Peter de Wint, Cornfields near Tring Station, Hertfordshire, 1847, Princeton University Art Museum The first branch railway line in England was the Aylesbury one, which opened in 1839.

Harlow in 1841, and Bishops Stortford in 1842. A branch to Hertford opened in 1843. The first Hatfield train crash took place on Boxing Day, 1870. The London Underground rail line reached Rickmansworth in 1887.Rook 1984, p. 104. Twentieth century =Pre World War II= The two flagship garden cities of Letchworth and Welwyn were central to the development of town planning in England. The first Garden City Company formed in 1903, with ¬£300,000 of capital, and by 1914, Letchworth had a population of around 10,000.Rook 1984, p. 128. Ebenezer Howard bought nearly in 1919, and the first house in Welwyn Garden City was occupied in 1920.

In the First World War, the Hertfordshire Yeomanry mobilised in September 1914 and were almost immediately deployed to Egypt.Robinson 1978, p. 124. The 2nd London Division of the Territorial Force had their headquarters at St Albans, and the North Midland Territorial Division was billeted there as well. The 1/1st Hertfordshire Regiment landed at Le Havre in November, and saw action in the Ypres Salient that month. The Hertfordshire Volunteer regiment formed on 15 May 1915.Robinson 1978, p. 125. On 13 October of that year, a Zeppelin raid hit North Road in Hertford, destroying houses there. In 1916, the Hertfordshire Regiment was transferred to 39th Division and fought at St Julien. Two Victoria Crosses (\\"VC\\") were awarded to Hertfordshire men in 1916: one to Corporal Alfred Alexander Burt and one to Lieutenant William Leefe Robinson, who shot down the first German airship of WWI, a Schutte-Lanz over Cuffley. Second Lieutenant Wulfstan Tempest shot down a Zeppelin on 2 October of that year, and it came down in Potters Bar. The 1st Battalion of the Hertfordshire Regiment fought near Achiet-le-Grant in 1918, and then at the Battle of Havrincourt. It also fought in the advance to Ghissignies. Hertfordshire's last VC of the First World War was awarded in December 1918, after the war had finished: a posthumous VC for Lieutenant Frank Young of Hitchin,Robinson 1978, p. 126. who was killed on 18 September 1918, aged 23.\\"Young VC\\", Bedford Regiment, retrieved 1 May 2010. With the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, 1st and 2nd Battalions of the Hertfordshire Regiment were mobilised.Robinson 1978, p. 130. Together with the 6th Battalion of the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment, they made up 162nd Infantry Brigade of the East Anglian Division. Second Battalion would later be at Ver-sur-Mer in Normandy in support of the D-Day landings. Mustang Is of No. 2 Squadron RAF operating from Sawbridgeworth In May 1940, a public meeting at County Hall, Hertford (which was then newly built, having only opened in 1939) was held to consider forming the Hertfordshire Local Defence Volunteers. Nineteen companies formed at once. They became the Hertfordshire Home Guard in December of that year. In 1942 the 191st (Hertfordshire and Essex Yeomanry) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery formed for an anticipated campaign in Northern Europe.Robinson 1978, p. 131. Hertfordshire was central to aircraft manufacture in the Second World War. De Havilland designed their Mosquito in Hatfield and constructed them at Leavesden, together with Halifax bombers.Rook 1984, p. 130. Many RAF pilots were trained at Panshanger. From 1940, No. 2 (AC) Squadron was stationed at RAF Sawbridgeworth, with the purpose of mounting tactical reconnaissance sorties over occupied Europe. Initially it operated the Westland Lysander, before re-equipping with the more capable Curtiss Tomahawk and North American Mustang aircraft. About 4000 bombs, 107 V-1 flying bombs, and 47 V-2 rockets fell on Hertfordshire during the Second World War. American Flying Fortresses bombers of the 398th Bombardment Group (Heavy) mounting 195 combat missions against targets on the Continent from RAF Nuthampstead. The United States Army Air Forces used RAF Bovingdon as a training station, while the US VIII Fighter Command Headquarters was at RAF Bushey Hall. =Post-War= After the war, Stevenage was the first town to be redeveloped under the New Towns Act 1946. Hatfield remained closely connected with the aircraft industry, and about 10% of the aircraft workers in England worked in Hertfordshire in the 1960s.Rook 1984, p. 132. The de Havilland Comet was developed in the town.Michael Harrison, \\"Glorious Chapter of Aviation History\\", The Independent, retrieved 13 May 2010. The London Government Act 1963 created an enlarged Greater London in 1965 which took Barnet from Hertfordshire, but in exchange, the county gained Potters Bar and South Mimms from Middlesex. The county's boundaries were revised in the reforms accompanying the Local Government Act 1972, at which time Royston became fully a part of Hertfordshire. Camfield House, Hatfield, belonged to Barbara Cartland during this period, and Beatrix Potter lived there as well. During the Second World War, sculptor Henry Moore moved to the village of Perry Green in Hertfordshire when his former home was bombed. The Henry Moore Foundation still operates from the village. The character of Hertfordshire changed in the later part of the 20th century. In 1992, it was resolved to close the aircraft manufacturing site in Hatfield. At the start of the 20th century, 83% of the workforce were involved in agriculture, but by the end, less than 1% remained so. Only one brewery, McMullens, is still open and there are no remaining commercial maltings or mills. Nowadays, Hertfordshire has become a service and administrative centre containing the head offices of several important companies (see here) and a dormitory for London. A growing trend is research and development, notably for Glaxo and at the University of Hertfordshire which, from relatively humble beginnings as Hatfield Polytechnic, now has over 23,000 students. On 17 October 2000, a major rail crash took place in Hatfield.\\"Hatfield Rail Crash\\", BBC, retrieved 30 April 2010.

Conservation Hertfordshire has a larger number of listed buildings and village greens pre-dating 1700 than Greater London, see for example Grade II* listed buildings in Hertfordshire which tend to be in this category. All 10 District (or Borough) Councils have designated conservation areas. Crime and criminals King Stephen held court at St Albans in 1143. He arrested Geoffrey de Mandeville, who held shrievalty of London, Middlesex and Hertfordshire from the pretender Empress Matilda. De Mandeville surrendered his castles, including the one he had recently built at South Mimms,Robinson 1978, p. 18. and went on to become a noted outlaw and bandit. A seventeenth-century highwaywoman, called the \\"Wicked Lady\\", preyed on travellers on Nomansland Common along Watling Street to the far end of Wales. This may have been Lady Katherine Ferrers of Markyate Cell 1634-1660 who was married to a detached husband Thomas Fanshaw(e) and whose body was carried across the county to be buried at Ware. By the time of an 1840 fire at the large house, a folklore rhyme had arisen: In one of the last witch trials recorded, Jane Wenham, of Walkern, was convicted of witchcraft in 1712. The accused was over the age of 70 at the time.Robinson 1978, p. 81. Queen Anne pardoned Wenham, who \\"lived on in a cottage at Gilston\\". In 1751, John and Ruth Osborne of Gubblecot, Tring, were accused of witchcraft. A mob dragged them through the village pond until Ruth drowned.Robinson 1978, p. 85. One Thomas Colley, a chimney sweep and apparently the ringleader, was hanged; but the people disapproved of the hanging and did not come to watch. There are records for Hitchin court from the 17th century.

He pretended to be deaf, so that people would talk freely while he moved among them selling pies, overhearing their destinations and the location of their valuables; and, with his sons who blackened their faces, would ambush them later that night. Clibborn was shot dead in 1782 by one George North on the Datchworth to Branfield road. In 1823, the murder of William Weare in Radlett became known as the first trial by newspaper.\\"Elstree Murder Feature\\", BBC, retrieved 8 November 2009. The murderer, who was the Mayor of Norwich's son John Thurtell, a notorious gambler, pleaded that the sensational newspaper coverage had prejudiced the court against him. It only took 20 minutes of deliberations for the jury to sentence him to death by hanging. The crowds that gathered for the trial were so large that the judge had trouble getting to the courthouse through the gridlocked streets, and about 15,000 people attended the hanging itself. The murder of Mercy Nicholls in Railway Street, Hertford, in 1899, ultimately led to a major re- organisation of Hertfordshire's police force.\\"Hertford Horror\\", BBC, retrieved 8 November 2009.

He worked in Hertfordshire (but later what became the London Borough of Barnet), and witnessed the birth of the movies as an assistant/cameraman of Birt Acres (1854‚Äì1918). Acres, in 1895, co-developed the first British 35 mm moving picture camera under the guidance of British engineer R.W. Paul.

Now retired, Robertson invests in other hedge funds, mostly those run by former employees of his own defunct hedge fund company, Tiger Management. The so-called Tiger cubs manage around 50 of the world's top hedge funds, including Stephen Mandal's Lone Pine, Andreas Halvorsen's Viking, Rob Citrone's Discovery Capital Management, Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management, Lee Ainslie of Maverick Capital and Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management. He is a signatory of The Giving Pledge. Robertson founded Tiger Management, one of the earliest hedge funds. Robertson is credited with turning $8 million in start-up capital in 1980 into over $22 billion in the late 1990s, though that was followed by a rapid downward spiral of investor withdrawals that ended with the fund closing in 2000. In 1993, his compensation and share of Tiger's gain exceeded $300 million. His 2003 estimated net worth was over $400 million, and in December 2017 it was estimated by Forbes at $4.1 billion.Julian Robertson - Forbes, Forbes.com. Accessed May 2015. Robertson said in 2008 that he shorted subprime securities and made money through credit default swaps.Tiger's Julian Robertson Roars Again, Brian O'Keefe, Fortune Senior Editor, Jan. 28, 2008 The following year, according to Forbes, Robertson's return on his $200 million personal trading account was 150 percent. Early life and education Robertson is the son of Julian Hart Robertson Sr., a textile company executive, and the former Blanche Spencer.Julian Robertson: A Tiger in the Land of Bulls and Bears, Daniel A. Strachman, Published by John Wiley and Sons, 2004, He graduated from Episcopal High School in 1951 and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1955. While at Chapel Hill, he was admitted to Zeta Psi fraternity. He then served as an officer in the U.S. Navy until 1957.Rowe. After leaving the Navy, Robertson moved to New York City and worked for a time as a stockbroker for Kidder, Peabody & Co. At Kidder, he eventually headed the firm's asset management division (Webster Securities) before departing to move with his family to New Zealand for a year to write a novel. On his return, in 1980 Robertson launched Tiger Management with initial investments from friends and family. Investment career On April 1, 1996, BusinessWeek carried a cover story written by reporter Gary Weiss, called \\"Fall of the Wizard\\", that was critical of Robertson's performance and behavior as founder and manager of Tiger Management. Robertson subsequently sued Weiss and BusinessWeek for $1 billion for defamation. The suit was settled with no money changing hands and BusinessWeek standing by the substance of its reporting.   The Tiger funds reached a peak of $22 billion in assets in 1998. Robertson's Tiger Fund accurately predicted the Tech Bubble, purposely underweighting the sector due to the overpricing of technology securities in comparison to their earnings and earning potential. So, though Tiger underperformed the S&P; 500 in the short term, the fund accurately predicted the underlying flaw in the market. \\"The proportion invested into technology stocks by Tiger Management, for example, a well-known value-manager, is low. In 1999 Tiger eliminated virtually all investments in this segment. This is consistent with the widely reported refusal of Julian Robertson, manager of the Tiger Fund, to buy into the internet bubble.\\" Tiger's largest equity holding at that time was U.S. Airways, whose troubles dragged down the value of his holdings. Such missteps ultimately led him to close his investment company in March 2000 and return all outside capital to investors. Tiger earlier made $2 billion in gains but then gave most of them back during a huge one-day move in the yen in 1998. In September 2001, Robertson distributed 24.8 million greatly devalued U.S. Airways shares to former Tiger investors. Robertson declared his intent to hold onto his own stock in the airline.\\"Investing Diary; Left Holding the Bag On US Airways Stock\\", by Laurence Zuckerman, September 23, 2001 At September 2020 around 50% of his investments were in the technology sector, with the largest investments being in JD.com, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon. After Tiger Kauri Cliffs Lodge near Matauri Bay After closing his fund in 2000, Robertson kept his hand in the hedge fund business by supporting and financing upcoming hedge fund managers (38 in total as of September 2009), in return for a stake in their fund management companies.

Robertson is the founder and benefactor of the Robertson Scholars Program which awards a merit scholarship that provides four-year full-tuition, room, and board, and travel funding for 36 Duke University and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill students each year. In August 2010, Robertson signed The Giving Pledge, an initiative by software mogul Bill Gates and investor Warren Buffett in which the wealthy would pledge at least half their assets to charity. He also is active as an investor and developer in New Zealand, where he spends some time. His family owns three lodges: Kauri Cliffs Lodge near Matauri Bay in Northland; Matakauri Lodge Queenstown; and The Farm at Cape Kidnappers, Hawkes Bay, as well as several wineries. Robertson was appointed an Honorary Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to business and philanthropy, in the 2010 New Year Honours. In 2009, it was announced that Robertson would donate art valued at $115 million to the Auckland Art Gallery. The donation included works by Paul Cezanne, Paul Gauguin, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Piet Mondrian, Salvador Dali, Georges Braque, Andre Derain, Fernand Leger, Pierre Bonnard and Henri Fantin-Latour and was the largest of its kind in Australasia.

With Pest-√∫jhely and √öj-palota it comprises District XV.  History  In the early Middle Ages there were about six villages in the northern part of the R√°kos plain. About 1200 a church was built on the little hill next to the Szilas brook - the ancestor of the present Catholic chapel. The first name of the village was Ny√≠r (Birch) but later it became known as Palota (Palace) after the castle of the landowner. The little community had very hard times in the 16th-17th centuries when Buda was under Turkish occupation but it survived thanks to the residents' strong Calvinist religion. After the liberation of Buda in 1696 R√°kospalota became one of the most prosperous villages in the region. Market gardening and agriculture flourished, and two baroque churches were built: one for the Calvinist community (it was demolished at the beginning of the 20th century) and a little Catholic chapel in 1735 on the foundation of the ancient village church. In 1846 the first railway line of Hungary (Pest-V√°c) reached R√°kospalota, and the Forest of Palota became a popular beauty spot with restaurants and places of entertainment. Next to the station a new suburb grew with nice villas for the rich citizens of Pest. In the second part of the 19th century Palota was already out of fashion and later the forest was cut down, but in this neighbourhood there are still some derelict, beautiful old homes. From the 1890s the spread of Budapest reached the village and the council sold out the ploughland for new suburbs. The residents of √öjfalu (New Village), Benk≈ë-telep, Kov√°csi-telep and Kertv√°ros (Garden Town) were lower-middle-class people and workers from Budapest. These new settlements have a regular grid layout and pleasant houses with gardens. The old peasant village became known as √ñregfalu (Old Village). A sumptuous Gothic Revival cathedral, Lutheran Church, Moorish Synagoge, a new big Calvinist church and a Town Hall marked the wealth of the town but there were serious social tensions between the new and the old residents. The peasant farmers of √ñregfalu kept their rich folk traditions, religion and sense of identity until the 1950s. R√°kospalota became a town in 1923 and part of Great-Budapest in 1950.  Neighbourhoods  One of the most interesting and special parts of the district is M√ÅV-telep. The suburb was built by the Hungarian State Railways (M√ÅV) in the early 1900s for railwaymen. The big art deco blocks of flats were planned in uniform style. Two churches and a market hall served the spiritual and physical needs of the close, tight-knit community. Unfortunately the new M3 freeway cut into two pieces the \\"telep\\" (settlement) in the 1980s, but the leafy gardens, narrow streets and nice buildings breathe a special ambience.  Landmarks  Most of the district around R√°kospalota is pleasant, leafy suburb. The F≈ë utca (Main Street) with the tramway has a typical market-town appearance from the turn- of-the-century. In Juhos utca (Sheep Street) and Attila utca there are still some old peasant houses. The Register of National Monuments consists of four buildings from R√°kospalota: Old Catholic Chapel (1735), Old Museum (Classic Revival, 19th century), Liva-malom (mill on the Szilas brook, 18th to 19th centuries) and Girl's College (early 20th century).

In the early years of the state, censorship was widely enforced, particularly in areas that were perceived to be in contradiction of Roman Catholic dogma, including abortion, sexuality and homosexuality. The church had banned many books and theories for centuries, listed in the Index Librorum Prohibitorum.Items in the Index between 1600 and 1966 are listed in: Jes√∫s Mart√≠nez de Bujanda, Marcella Richter; Index des livres interdits, Librairie Droz, 2002 Current censorship =Film censorship= The Republic of Ireland's Film Censors Office, renamed in 2008 as the Irish Film Classification Office, heavily cut films and videos for rental release, or placed high age ratings on them. In 2000 The Cider House Rules received an 18 certificate in the Republic of Ireland due to its themes of abortion and incest, although in other countries, such as the UK, the film received a 12 certificate. =Advertisements= Advertisements are regulated by the Advertising Standards Authority for Ireland, and must be truthful and factually accurate. In addition, adverts for illegal services are not allowed. The ASAI is a voluntary industry body which has no statutory powers and has no power to remove a publication from circulation. This power is vested in the Censorship of Publications Board. Given the status of the ASAI some advertisers choose to continually ignore its rulings by running controversial advertisements purely to draw attention to their products and services. =Newspapers and magazines= Whilst still theoretically censorable, newspapers and magazines are free to publish anything which does not break Ireland's tough libel laws. The Censorship of Publications Board reviews newspapers and magazines referred to it by the Customs and Excise and by members of the public. Until the late 1980s a large number of (mainly foreign) newspaper and magazines were banned in Ireland including Playboy and the News of the World, the British edition of which was still, theoretically, banned when it ceased publication. The listing of periodicals under permanent banning orders as of 2007 includes many publications which have ceased to be published, as well as ones which are now sold freely without any realistic chance of prosecution, such as Health and Efficiency and The Weekly News. A large proportion of the banning orders date from the 1950s or before; and a similar proportion cover true crime publications, a type which were once illegal due to a perceived risk of glorifying or encouraging criminal behaviour. In 2011, Paul Raymond Publications successfully appealed against the ban on 5 of their publications, one of which has been banned for nearly 80 years, and these publications can now be freely sold. =Pornography= Pornography that includes any participants being beneath the Irish age of consent is strictly illegal. This includes videos, DVD, film, photographs, digital files, drawings and text descriptions. There are no other laws banning specific types of pornography in Ireland. However, distribution of obscene material by phone can be prosecuted under the Post Office (Amendment) Act of 1951, the Director of Film Classification at the Irish Film Classification Office may ban public display of films considered to be obscene, and the Censorship of Publications Board may prohibit the sale and distribution of books and periodicals if they are found to be obscene. The magazine Playboy was illegal in Ireland until 1995.Censors lift ban on Playboy, Sun Journal - 27 Sep 1995 In the 1960s, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin John Charles McQuaid lobbied the Irish government to have pornography banned outright. The government-controlled IE Domain Registry currently has a ban on all domain names it considers \\"offensive or contrary to public policy or generally accepted principles of morality\\". In particular, the domains Pornography.ie and Porn.ie are known to be banned. =Central Bank of Ireland= In July 2009, the Central Bank of Ireland blocked insurers and banks from making any critical statements containing \\"any references\\" to them by means either of \\"public press statements\\" or un-approved public references, whether \\"written or oral.\\" =The Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010= This Act was passed by 78‚Äì71 in December 2010 in partial response to the post-2008 Irish banking crisis. Section 60 provides that the Irish government may apply to the courts for an order made under the Act to be heard in private. Section 59 prohibits anyone from publishing the fact that the minister has made an order or direction under the Act; even publication that such a prohibition order has been made is also an offence under the Act. Days after the Act was passed, an order was sought by minister Brian Lenihan Jnr and approved allowing a transfer of over ‚Ç¨3,700,000,000 into Allied Irish Bank, then an insolvent bank.http://newswhip.ie/national-2/extent-of-lenihans-new-powers-on-show-as- reporters-excluded-from-aib-court-hearing Two Irish Times reporters were expelled from the court by judge Maureen Clark just before the hearing.The Sunday Times Irish edition, business section, 2 January 2011, page 4. Censorship of books On 18 November 1942 Senator Sir John Keane moved in Seanad √âireann: \\"That, in the opinion of Seanad √âireann, the Censorship of Publications Board appointed by the Minister for Justice under the Censorship of Publications Act 1929, has ceased to retain public confidence, and that steps should be taken by the Minister to reconstitute the board.\\". After four days of debate, the motion was roundly defeated: T√° (for) 2 votes ‚Äì Sir John Keane and Joseph Johnston ‚Äì N√≠l (against) 34 votes. Formerly censored topics =The Troubles: RT√â and Section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act= During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, 1968‚Äì1994, censorship was used principally to prevent Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann (RT√â) interviews with spokespersons for Sinn F√©in and for the IRA. Under Section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act (1960), the Minister for Posts & Telegraphs could issue a Ministerial Order to the government-appointed RT√â Authority not to broadcast material specified in the written order. In 1971 the first ever Order under the section was issued by Fianna F√°il Minister for Posts and Telegraphs Gerry Collins. It instructed RT√â not to broadcast, :any matter that could be calculated to promote the aims or activities of any organisation which engages in, promotes, encourages or advocates the attaining of any particular objectives by violent means. Collins refused clarification when RT√â asked for advice on what this legal instruction meant in practice. RT√â interpreted the Order politically to mean that spokespersons for the Provisional and Official IRA could no longer appear on air. In 1972 the government sacked the RT√â Authority for not sufficiently disciplining broadcasters the government accused of breaching the Order. RT√â's Kevin O'Kelly had reported on an interview he conducted with the (Provisional) IRA Chief of Staff, Sean MacStiof√°in, on the Radio √âireann This Week programme. The recorded interview was not itself broadcast. MacStiof√°in's voice was not heard. However, he was arrested after the O'Kelly interview and charged with membership of the IRA, an illegal organisation. Soon afterwards at the non- jury Special Criminal Court O'Kelly was jailed briefly for contempt because he refused to identify a voice on a tape seized by the Garda√≠ as that of Mac Stiof√°in. Mac Stiof√°in was convicted in any case. On appeal by O'Kelly to the Supreme Court a fine was substituted as a means purging O'Kelly's contempt. The fine was paid anonymously and O'Kelly was released. In 1976, Labour Minister for Posts and Telegraphs Conor Cruise O'Brien amended Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act. He also issued a new Section 31 Order. O'Brien censored spokespersons for specific organisations, including the Sinn F√©in political party, rather than specified content. This prevented RT√â from interviewing Sinn F√©in spokespersons under any circumstances, even where the subject was not related to the IRA campaign in Northern Ireland conflict. On one occasion this led to the interruption of a call-in show about gardening on radio, due to a caller being a member of Sinn F√©in. The changes eroded liberal interpretations by RT√â of its censorship responsibilities, afforded by the original 1971 Order, and encouraged a process of illiberal interpretation.Historian, Politician, Censor : Conor Cruise O'Brien, 1917‚Äì2008 By Niall Meehan, Counter Punch, 22 December 2008Conor Cruise O'Brien ‚Äì Obituary by Brian Fallon, guardian.co.uk, Friday 19 December 2008. In 1976 also, O'Brien attempted to extend censorship to newspaper coverage of the 'Troubles', targeting in particular The Irish Press;Page 380, The Troubles: Ireland's ordeal, 1966‚Äì1996, and the search for peace By Tim Pat Coogan, Palgrave MacMillan, 2002 In an interview with Washington Post reporter Bernard Nossiter, O'Brien identified Press Editor, Tim Pat Coogan, as someone who might be prosecuted under a proposed amendment to the Offences Against the State Act. O'Brien cited pro-republican Letters to the Editor as coming under the terms of the legislation, for which the editor could be made legally liable. Coogan, who was immediately warned of O'Brien's intentions by Nossiter, then published the Nossiter-O'Brien interview (as also did The Irish Times). Due to public opposition the proposed provisions were amended to remove the perceived threat to newspapers. The 1973-77 Fine Gael/Labour Coalition Government also tried to prosecute the Irish Press for its coverage of the maltreatment of republican prisoners by the Garda Heavy Gang, with the paper winning the case.Page 118, Irish Media: A Critical History Since 1922 By John Horgan, Routledge, 2001 The United Kingdom operated similar rules between 1988 and 1994 covering eleven republican and loyalist organisations, that were not as severe as the Section 31 Order. For instance, British broadcasters could dub Sinn F√©in speeches and interviews with an actor's voice, or subtitle footage. This was not possible in Ireland where O'Brien's Section 31 Order (that remained in place until 1994) specifically banned 'reports of interviews' with spokespersons for censored organisations. Moreover, British broadcasters were more liberal than RT√â in defining when a person was a spokesperson for a censored organisation. They held that an MP like Sinn F√©in President Gerry Adams or a Sinn F√©in councillor could be interviewed about constituency business or in their private capacity. RT√â would not allow this under any circumstances, a stance that caused a crisis in RT√â in the early 1990s. In addition, the British censorship rules did not apply at election time, whereas they operated at all times in the Republic of Ireland. Under severe pressure from successive governments, from approximately 1977 RT√â extended Section 31 to censor all Sinn F√©in members, not merely the Sinn F√©in spokespersons specified in the Section 31 Order. This extension of the Order came to a head in the early 1990s. Sinn F√©in member Larry O'Toole was not permitted to talk on RT√â about a strike in Gateaux, a cake factory in Finglas north Dublin, where O'Toole worked. He was informed in writing by RT√â that his Sinn F√©in membership was the reason for the censorship. O'Toole challenged what he contended was RT√â self-censorship in the High Court. After the court found in O'Toole's favour in August 1992, RT√â appealed the ruling that liberalised its Section 31 regime. Consequently, RT√â were accused of appealing to be censored. RT√â then lost in the Supreme Court in March 1993. In 1991, European Commission of Human Rights upheld the ban in case Purcell v. Ireland, though not unanimously. The Section 31 broadcasting ban lapsed on 19 January 1994 because it was not renewed by Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht Michael D. Higgins, eight months prior to the August 1994 IRA ceasefire. The last person censored under the lapsing Order in January 1994 was Larry O'Toole, who was banned from appearing in a joint RT√â/Channel Four programme on the Northern Ireland conflict, chaired by Channel Four's John Snow. The Channel Four production team wished to speak to O'Toole about his court victory. RT√â would not allow this as O'Toole had been chosen as a candidate in European elections to be held five months later. RT√â said O'Toole was therefore a Sinn F√©in spokesperson, irrespective of the capacity in which he was to be interviewed or the proposed interview's distant relationship with a future election. =Abortion and birth control= Until the early 1990s, discussing abortion in any way, including the provision of impartial information, was disallowed, and any publication providing information on the medical treatment would be confiscated. In the 1980s, the Irish Family Planning Association and the Trinity College Dublin and University College Dublin students' unions were successfully sued by the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children for publishing telephone numbers for abortion clinics in the United Kingdom. On one occasion British newspaper The Guardian was withdrawn by its Irish distributors for a day to preempt a threatened ban due to the inclusion of an advertisement for a UK abortion clinic in that day's issue (despite the advert having appeared on a number of prior occasions without incident). In May 1992, the Democratic Left T.D. Proinsias De Rossa subverted this ban by reading the offending telephone numbers into the D√°il record; because of his absolute privilege as a member of the Oireachtas, he avoided a lawsuit. In the wake of the X Case, the fourteenth amendment of the Constitution of Irelandapproved in November 1992 removed the constitutional prohibition. Regulation of access to information to abortion was put on a statutory basis by the Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State For Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995. This was repealed by the Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018. =Blasphemy= Until 2018, blasphemy was prohibited by Article 40.6.1¬∫.i. of the 1937 Constitution. The common law offence of blasphemous libel, applicable only to Christianity and last prosecuted in 1855, was ruled in 1999 to be incompatible with the Constitution's guarantee of religious equality. Since banning blasphemy was mandated by the Constitution, abolishing the offence required a referendum. Since it was deemed by the government of the time that a referendum solely for that purpose \\"would rightly be seen as a time wasting and expensive exercise\\", the lacuna was filled in 2009 by a new offence of \\"publication or utterance of blasphemous matter\\", against any religion, under the Defamation Act 2009, section 36. The law included the offence of blasphemous libel. It was never enforced. The advocacy group Atheist Ireland responded to the enactment by announcing the formation of the \\"Church of Dermotology\\" (named after Dermot Ahern, the minister who introduced the 2009 law).[51] On the date on which the law came into effect, it published a series of potentially blasphemous quotations on its website and vowed to challenge any resulting legal action.[52] Scientist Richard Dawkins described the new law as \\"wretched, backward and uncivilised\\". After the 2015 Charlie Hebdo shooting, Ali Selim of the Islamic Cultural Centre of Ireland suggested that the blasphemy provision of the Defamation Act 2009 should be applied to any media outlet reproducing cartoons depicting Muhammad as part of the \\"Je suis Charlie\\" campaign.[53] The text of the 2009 Act defined the crime where: he or she publishes or utters matter that is grossly abusive or insulting in relation to matters held sacred by any religion, thereby causing outrage among a substantial number of the adherents of that religion, and (b) he or she intends, by the publication or utterance of the matter concerned, to cause such outrage. * The judge would need to be satisfied the matter is \\"abusive and insulting\\" as distinct from opinion. * Judicial interpretation of \\"held sacred\\" and \\"any religion\\" could render the Act unenforceable. * A defendant's lawyer would argue the definition of \\"grossly\\", \\"thereby causing\\", \\"outrage\\" and \\"substantial number\\". * Article s.36 (3) provides that ‚Äì \\"it shall be a defence to proceedings for an offence under this section for the defendant to prove that a reasonable person would find genuine literary, artistic, political, scientific, or academic value in the matter to which the offence relates. * Further, a \\"religion\\" is further defined in s.36 (4); it ‚Äì does not include an organisation or cult‚Äî (a) the principal object of which is the making of profit, or (b) that employs oppressive psychological manipulation‚Äî (i) of its followers, or (ii) for the purpose of gaining new followers. * s.36 could be held to be in breach of 44.2.1¬∫ of the Constitution The State shall not impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the ground of religious profession, belief or status.\\" In October 2014, Minister of State Aodh√°n √ì R√≠ord√°in gave the official government response to a report on the blasphemy issue by the Constitutional Convention, announcing that it had decided to hold a referendum on the issue.[71] On 26 October 2018, a constitutional amendment was approved by a margin of 64.85% to 35.15% which removed the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution. The provisions of the Defamation Act 2009 were repealed upon the commencement of the Blasphemy (Abolition of Offences and Related Matters) Act 2019 on 17 January 2020. =Mail= Censorship of mail in Ireland goes back to, at least, the 1660s and possibly earlier. Both overt and covert censorship of Irish mail took place, mainly in England and sometimes using warrants, from then through the 19th century. The Irish Civil War saw mail raided by the IRA marked as censored and sometimes opened. This is the first recorded such action within the new state. The National Army also opened mail and censorship of irregulars' mail in prisons took place. Envelope from Dublin to USA showing a bilingual Irish censor handstamp used 8 September 1939, just six days after the enabling legislation was enacted During the 1939‚Äì1945 Emergency extensive postal censorship took place under the control of the Department of Defence whose powers were conferred by the Emergency Powers Act 1939. Civilian mail was controlled by the approximately 200 censors who worked in Dublin's Exchequer Street and who had all been vetted by the G2 Directorate of Intelligence and the Garda√≠. Using the Black List and White List to target certain mail, the small staff were unable to effect 100% censorship; however, continental European mail was all reviewed, as was all incoming and outbound airmail. Following the overthrow of France and the Low Countries in May 1940, the British instigated full terminal mail censorship but the Irish were unable to look at more than about 10% due to the enormous staff this would have required. Covert censorship of mail between Northern Ireland and the south was effected by warrants obtained by G2, who also obtained warrants from the Minister for Justice for internal mail oversight. The military internees, British, German and a few of other nationalities, held in the Curragh Camp had their mail censored, even local mail, though they are known to have posted their letters outside the camp to try to evade the camp oversight. IRA internees' mail was also censored under the Offences against the State Act that had been in place since June 1939.√ì Drisceoil (1996), p. 235 The Border Campaign led to the internment of IRA members, again under the Offences against the State Act, and their mail was overtly censored between 1957 and 1960 most often with an Irish language censor mark reading Ceadaithe ag an gCinsire Mileata applied to the outside of the letter and also to the sheets contained within.Moxter (2003), pps.99‚Äì100 In the 1980s mail from IRA members imprisoned in Limerick and likely also Portlaoise prisons has been recorded as censored but there is no record of civilian mail censorship since 1945.Moxter (2003), p. 117‚Äì118 Unusual omissions =Music= Music videos are exempt from film classification, whereas in the UK, they must be classified. Broadcasters usually use their discretion and obey the UK classifications and showing-time restrictions. Ireland receives all of the UK music channels, which are subject to UK music video laws; with the only Irish regulated broadcaster regularly showing music videos being Channel 6 or City Channel. However, for several years TV3 ran a late-night music programme, which quite often showed uncensored music videos containing large amounts of nudity. References to records or songs being \\"banned\\" in Ireland refer to one or more radio stations refusing to play the songs rather than any legislative ban, although before 1989 it may have been a moot point given that the only legal broadcasting stations in Ireland were those operated by state broadcaster RT√â. In the 1930s there was even a short-lived airplay ban on an entire genre of music known as the \\"ban on Jazz\\" (with an exceptionally wide definition of what constituted \\"jazz\\"). Such bans only served to further increase listenership to foreign radio stations (such as Radio Luxembourg and the BBC) in Ireland, and led to the growth of Irish pirate radio. The ban by the Irish courts of the song \\"They never came home\\" by Christy Moore along with the original version of the album \\"Ordinary Man\\" on which it appeared has apparently never been overturned. In late 2017 RT√â's Irish language station Raidi√≥ na Gaeltachta removed the track \\"C.E.A.R.T.A\\" by west Belfast Irish language rap duo KNEECAP from an afternoon programme's playlist due to the song's \\"drug references and cursing\\". =Computer games= Unlike most other countries, the Film Censors Office have little involvement in video game censorship. This led to an unusual situation where in the 1990s the UK-owned GAME sold the sanitised versions of Carmageddon which was a victim of censorship in the UK, whilst Irish owned stores sold the uncut versions imported from the United States. Games may only be banned if the Film Censor judges that it is unfit for viewing, which has happened once to date, with the banning of Manhunt 2 on 18 June 2007, over two weeks before its launch date of 6 July. Ireland is a member of PEGI, but places no legal powers on its age recommendations. Retailers may attempt to enforce them at their discretion. Irish statutes on censorship *The Censorship of Films Act 1923 was an act \\"to provide for the official censoring of cinematographic pictures and for other matters connected therewith\\". It established the office of the Official Censor of Films and a Censorship of Films Appeal Board (and see William Magennis). It was amended by the Censorship of Films (Amendment) Act 1925, in connection with advertisements for films. It was amended by the Censorship of Films (Amendment) Act 1930 to extend the legislation to \\"vocal or other sounds\\" accompanying pictures. *The Committee on Evil Literature was appointed in 1926 to report on the effectiveness of the censorship laws. It concluded that the then-current censorship laws were inadequate, and that the government had a duty to ban \\"morally corrupting\\" literature. *The Censorship of Publications Act 1929 was an act \\"to make provision for the prohibition of the sale and distribution of unwholesome literature and for that purpose to provide for the establishment of a censorship of books and periodical publications, and to restrict the publication of reports of certain classes of judicial proceedings and for other purposes incidental to the matters aforesaid\\". It established the Censorship of Publications Board. A book caught by the act was one that \\"in its general tendency indecent or obscene ... or ... advocates the unnatural prevention of conception or the procurement of abortion or miscarriage or the use of any method, treatment or appliance for the purpose of such prevention or such miscarriage\\". *The Emergency Powers Act 1939 dealt with the preservation of the State in time of war and contained provisions relating to the censorship of communications, including mail, newspapers and periodicals. *The Censorship of Publications Act 1946 repealed a large part of the 1929 act and was \\"to make further and better provision for the censorship of books and periodical publications\\". Periodicals caught by the act included issues that \\"have devoted an unduly large proportion of space to the publication of matter relating to crime\\". *The Censorship of Publications Act 1967 provided for prohibition orders made on the grounds of indecency or obscenity to expire after a period of twelve years. A further prohibition order could then be made by the Censorship of Publications Board in respect of the same book. *The Health (Family Planning) Act 1979 deleted references to \\"the unnatural prevention of conception\\" in the Censorship of Publications Act 1929 and the Censorship of Publications Act 1946. *The Regulation of Information (Services Outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995 modified the effect of the Censorship of Publications Acts 1929 to 1967 in respect of certain information likely to be required by a woman to avail herself of \\"services provided outside the State for the termination of pregnancies\\". However, the information in question must not advocate or promote the termination of pregnancy. *The Defamation Act 2009 which defines such offences. *The Health (Regulation of Termination of Pregnancy) Act 2018 repealed **(a) sections 16 and 17 (1) of the Censorship of Publications Act 1929; **(b) sections 7 (b) and 9 (1)(b) of the Censorship of Publications Act 1946; **(c) section 10 of the Health (Family Planning) Act 1979; **(d) the Regulation of Information (Services outside the State for Termination of Pregnancies) Act 1995. *The Blasphemy (Abolition of Offences and Related Matters) Act 2019 which **(a) amended section 7 (2)(a)(ii) of the Censorship of Films Act 1923; **(b) amended section 3 (2) of the Censorship of Films (Amendment) Act 1925; **(c) repealed sections 36 and 37 of the Defamation Act 2009.

During the Mesolithic period, sea levels in northern Europe were some 30 to 40 metres lower than today, and the land that became Britain was a peninsula of northern Europe. The island was formed at the end of the last Ice Age, about 8‚Äì9000 years ago, as sea levels rose, and the land of southern Britain sunk due to the post-glacial rebound of the north that had been under the ice. This flooded the former river valley of the Solent to the north, and the future English Channel to the south, and cut Wight off from the island of Britain. Once open to the sea, tidal scouring widened the Solent. Early history =Prehistory= The first inhabitants are assumed to have been hunter-gatherers migrating by land during the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age) period, as the ice age began to recede and the climate improved. The island has no visible Paleolithic or Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age) sites, but flints from these periods have been found and are on display at Carisbrooke Castle. =Neolithic = There are theories that, during the Neolithic era, Bouldnor was a seaport that traded with the Middle East, or that nomadic gatherers roamed over wider areas than previously thought, because wheat was present there 8,000 years ago, hundreds if not thousands of years before it is known to have been grown in northern Europe. The Longstone near Mottistone (the standing stone on the hill later becoming an Anglo-Saxon meeting place, this 'moot-stone' giving name to the nearby settlement) is one of the only three surviving Neolithic (New Stone Age) sites, along with a long barrow on Afton Down and a 'mortuary enclosure' on Tennyson Down. =Bronze Age= Between the Neolithic and Roman eras, Southeastern Britain experienced significant in migration from the continent. Finds of late Late Iron Age coins, such as the South Wight and Shalfleet Hoards, suggest trading links both with nearby tribes and further afield. The coins and ingots from these hoards had been defaced before burial, for reasons that are unknown; this feature has only been found in coin finds from Hampshire and Wight. The variety of origin of the coins found locally is more marked than elsewhere in Britain and suggests that the island may have had a degree of political separation. The island has over 240 bronze age burial mounds or round barrows, nearly all on the chalk downs. One plough-damaged barrow on Gallibury Down was excavated during 1979-80 and dated to between 1600-1400 BCE. There is also evidence from aerial photographs of ring ditches (the remains of barrows) on the limestone near Bembridge. The only significant Iron Age find is at Chillerton Down, where there was a hill fort. However three of the Roman villa sites have also produced late Iron Age pottery, which suggests a continuity of occupation. Bronze Age Britain had large reserves of tin from mining in Cornwall and Devon. Tin is necessary to smelt bronze. At that time the sea level was much lower, and so tin for export could be brought across the Solent at low tide on carts, or possibly on boats such as those found at Ferriby. A shortage of tin during the Bronze Age collapse and trade disruptions in the Mediterranean around 1300 BCE may have forced metalworkers to seek an alternative to bronze. =Etymology= It has been suggested that a 1st century BCE reference to ŒäŒ∫œÑŒπŒΩ (Ictin) by the Graeco-Sicilian Diodorus Siculus might refer to the Isle of Wight, although St. Michael's Mount in Cornwall is now considered more likely.Full but inconclusive discussion is at romanmap.com - (accessed 11 August 2009) A century later, Pliny the Elder uses its Latin name Vectis and in the mid 2nd century Ptolemy confirms the position of Vectis as \\"...below Magnus Portus\\" (probably the port near Bosham). The Roman historian Suetonius calls the island \\"insula Vecta\\" in his account of its capture in year 43, referring to the future emperor Vespasian, who \\"proceeded to Britain where he fought thirty battles, subjugated two warlike tribes, and captured more than twenty towns, besides the entire Isle of Vectis\\".Channel 4 - Time Team 2002 The form Vectis seems reasonably robust but Rivet and SmithRivet, A. and Smith, C., The Place-Names of Roman Britain, Book Clubs Associates (1979), 487-9. were uncertain of its etymology. A gloss on an 1164 manuscript of Nennius equates Old English wiht with Latin divorcium, which has encouraged writers to think that the island sits like a lever (Latin vectis) between the two arms of the Solent. The word could be Brittonic, from a Celtic root akin to Irish fecht \\"journey\\" and Welsh gwaith \\"work\\". A detailed study in 2010Durham, A, The origin of the names Vectis and Wight, Proc. Isle Wight Nat. Hist. Archaeol. Soc. 25, 93-97. draws attention to the Proto-Germanic word *wextiz, which would have been Vectis in Latin, and survives in various modern-language forms, including Modern English whit \\"something small\\" (English wight is considered a revival from Middle English), German wicht \\"dwarf, imp\\", Dutch wicht \\"little girl\\" and Norwegian vette \\"being, creature (especially supernatural)\\". This might suggest that the meaning is something like \\"daughter island\\" or \\"little companion\\"; however if Germanic languages were not widely spoken in Britain during the Roman era, as has been the consensus, then they would be an unlikely source for the Latin Vectis. However more recently it has been argued that the inhabitants of southern Britain at this time may indeed have been Germanic, rather than Celtic, which could re- open the possibility of the island's name having Germanic roots. Roman mosaic at Brading Roman Villa =Roman era= The Romans occupied southern Britain, including the Isle of Wight, for nearly four hundred years. The Romans built no towns on the island, but it became an agricultural centre, and at least seven Roman villas are known.Villas are known at Brading, Carisbrooke, Clatterford (southwest of Carisbrooke), Combley (on Robin Hill), Gurnard, Newport, and Rock (north of Brighstone). The Roman villas at Newport and Brading have been excavated and are open to the public.David Wharton Lloyd, Nikolaus Pevsner, (2006), The Buildings of England: Isle of Wight, pages 15-16. Yale University Press. When fully developed around AD 300, Brading was probably the largest on the Island, being a courtyard villa with impressive mosaics, suggesting a good income was being made from the agricultural produce of the island. At Brading Villa a field system can be seen near Brading Down; the remains associated with the villa can be seen as low banks. The chalk downland was cultivated in prehistoric and Roman times because the light chalk soil was not too difficult to plough. It is very likely indeed that the Romans grew vines, as the climate was then warmer than it is now, and on this basis nearby Adgestone Vineyard claims to be the oldest in Britain. By the late fourth or early fifth centuries AD, Roman troops and officials had withdrawn from Britain. =Jutish kingdom= In Bede's ecclesiastical history, Vecta [sic], along with parts of Hampshire and most of Kent, was settled by Jutes. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Cerdic and his son Cynric conquered the island in 530. The Chronicle states that after Cerdic died in 534, the island was given to his nephews Stuf and Wihtgar. However, it is uncertain whether \\"Wihtgar\\", who is believed to have died in 544, was a real person or came from a misunderstood place name. The \\"Men of Wight\\" were known as \\"Wihtwara\\". Carisbrooke was known as the \\"Fort of the Men of Wight\\" (\\"Wihtwarasburgh\\"), or alternatively the fort may have been named after Wihtgar. It is believed that the island became a Jutish kingdom ruled by King Stuf and his successors, until 661 when it was invaded by Wulfhere of Mercia and forcibly converted to Christianity. When he returned to Mercia the island reverted to paganism. Arwald was its last Jutish King and the last pagan king in Anglo-Saxon England until the Vikings.\\"Timeline of Christianity\\", Shropshire Christian Religion Bede describes the invasion of the island in 686 (noting that Bede was writing fifty years later, and some of his dates are considered approximate) by Caedwalla, a Wessex King. He writes: \\"After Caedwalla had obtained possession of the kingdom of the Gewissae, he took also the Isle of Wight, which till then was entirely given over to idolatry, and by merciless slaughter, endeavoured to destroy all the inhabitants thereof, and to place in their stead people from his own province; binding himself by a vow, though it is said that he was not yet regenerated in Christ, to give the fourth part of the land and of the spoil to the Lord, if he took the Island. He fulfilled this vow by giving the same for the service of the Lord to Bishop Wilfrid...\\". Arwald died in action, and his nephews were betrayed to Caedwalla and executed. Bede adds that 300 \\"hides\\" (each being the land that could support a family) were given to the Church. Little archaeological evidence of this period survives. The main sites are cemeteries at Chessell Down and Bowcombe Down, both excavated in the nineteenth century to produce skeletons, iron swords, knives, and jewellery such as brooches and buckles. The biggest brooches are in the British Museum but some swords, parts of shields, small brooches and buckles are retained in the county archaeological centre. =The Saxon period and the Vikings= From about 685-686 the island can be considered part of Wessex, and after the West Saxon kings ruled all England, then part of England. The Anglo Saxon Chronicle tells how Wiht-land suffered from Viking raids: \\"And then another time they lay in the Isle of Wight, and meanwhile ate out of Hampshire and of Sussex\\". Alfred the Great's navy defeated the Danes in 871 after they had \\"ravaged Devon and the Isle of Wight\\". Around 900 the kingdom was divided into shires, and the island became part of the shire of Hampshire. During the second wave of Viking attacks in the reign of Ethelred the Unready (975-1014) the island was often used by them as a temporary winter base, when they were unable to shelter with their 'cousins' in Normandy. In 1002 Ethelred ordered the killing of all Danes in England, in the St. Brice's Day Massacre.Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Abingdon ms, quoted in Ryan Lavelle, Aethelred II: King of the English, The History Press, 2008, p. 104 From 1003 onwards, Sweyn Forkbeard raided England, which may partly have been to avenge the massacre.Stenton, Anglo-Saxon England, pp. 384‚Äì6. Also in 1002 Ethelred had married the Norman princess Emma, and then persuaded the Normans not to give the Vikings shelter. Thereafter they were more regular visitors to the island. In 1006 the Chronicle records: \\"when it drew near to winter, the army travelled home, and after Martinmas the raiding- army came to its secure base on the Isle of Wight and there provided themselves everywhere whatever they needed\\", and then records raids that they made from there into southern England. In 1013 Sweyn began a more concerted invasion, and Ethelred was forced to flee to the island: \\"And then at midwinter the King turned from the fleet to the Isle of Wight, and was there for the season; and after the season turned across the sea to Richard [of Normandy], and was there until the happy event of Swein's death occurred.\\". After Ethelred himself died, England came under Danish rule, and the island continued to be a base for their fleets as recorded by the Chronicle in 1022: \\"Here King Cnut went out with his ships to Wight.\\" After England returned to an English king, occasional Viking raids continued; in 1048 the Chronicle records: \\"a great earth-tremor widely in England. And in the same year Sandwich and Wight were raided, and the best men that were there were killed; and King Edward [the Confessor] and the earls went out after them in their ships\\". The Viking practice of sub-dividing the kingdom amongst powerful Earls had survived their departure, and Wessex came under the control of Earl Godwin, and then his son Harold Godwinson, the future King Harold. During the war of succession in 1066, the island was used as a base by various contenders. Firstly \\"came Earl Tostig from beyond the sea into Wight, and with as great a fleet as he could get, and there was given both money and provisions; and then went from there, and did harm everywhere along the sea- cost he could get to\\" and later his brother Harold Godwinson \\"...went into Wight, and lay there all the summer and the autumn; and a land army was kept everywhere by the sea, although in the end it was to no avail\\". Both men had manors on the island - Harold at Kern and Tostig at Nunwell. The Norman Conquest After the Battle of Hastings in 1066, the Isle of Wight and the rest of England entered the Norman era. The island would not again be invaded by a foreign nation for another 479 years. In the Domesday book of 1086 the Island's name is \\"Wit\\". William the Conqueror gave its manorial rights to his kinsman William FitzOsbern, who became Lord of the Isle of Wight. Carisbrooke Priory and the fort of Carisbrooke Castle were founded (probably the site had previously been fortified, originally by Romans and subsequently by Jutes or Saxons; there are remains of a late Saxon wall or burgh as defence against Viking raiders). Thereafter allegiance on the island was sworn to FitzOsbern as 'Lord' rather than the king, a role subsequently granted to the de Redvers family by Henry I after his succession in 1100. For nearly 200 years the island was a semi-independent feudal fiefdom, with the de Redvers family ruling from Carisbrooke. The final private owner was the Norman Countess Isabella de Fortibus, who inherited it aged 25 after her brother died suddenly. She ruled for thirty years, during which time all of her children died. On her deathbed in 1293 she was persuaded to sell the island to Edward I, and so it came under control of the English crown. Newtown was laid out by a Bishop of Winchester and his ecclesiastical estate at Swainston, and granted Borough status in 1256. It did not prosper, partly because it was in competition with the existing ports of Yarmouth, Newport and Southampton, and partly because of the extensive damage it later suffered during French raids (especially in 1377). Newport was laid out in the late 12th Century as the 'new port' for Carisbrooke Castle, the town designed on a grid system, unusual for its time. Notable surviving monuments from this period include the 11th century church of St. Boniface at Bonchurch, the 12th century church at Yaverland, and the Norman entrance arch (now to the churchyard) at Binstead. Medieval period 15th century gatehouse of Carisbrooke Castle On 22 April 1313 the ship St. Marie was wrecked in Chale Bay, its cargo of wine plundered by local landowners. This led to the construction of St. Catherine's Oratory as penance for the crime. In 1374, the fleet of the Crown of Castile, led by Fernando S√°nchez de Tovar, sacked and burned the island. In 1377 French raiders attacked and burned several towns, including Newtown, and laid siege to Carisbrooke Castle. Peter de Heynoe, Lord of Stenbury, is said to have killed the French commander with a crossbow shot aimed through an arrow slit still visible in the castle's west wall. The island continued to be governed by a Lordship, but this was now a royal appointment (the position evolving over the years into a Captaincy and eventually a Governorship). It is sometimes said there was a brief interruption in 1444 when Henry Beauchamp was crowned King of the Isle of Wight, with King Henry VI placing the crown on his head; the regal title supposedly expired when he died heirless in 1446. But there little evidence to support this story.' Henry VIII developed the Royal Navy and its permanent base at Portsmouth, and ordered fortifications to be built at Yarmouth, Cowes, East Cowes and Sandown, sometimes using stone from the dissolved monasteries. 16th century The French invaded the island on 21 July 1545. English ships engaged the French navy; two days earlier, the Mary Rose had sunk, apparently without damage. Sir Richard Worsley, Captain of the Island, commanded the local militia who resisted the attack, after French troops landed on the southern coast intending to use the island as a base against the mainland. However, the local militia defeated the French troops at the Battle of Bonchurch (although one account claims the French were successful at Bonchurch but defeated at Bembridge). In 1587 two Catholic missionaries Anderton and Marsden, originally from Lancashire but trained in France, returned to England in disguise, heading for Dover. However, due to a gale their ship landed in Cowes. Fellow passengers had overheard them praying and they were reported on arrival to Governor Carey, taken to London for trial, then executed by hanging, drawing and quartering in Cowes. They were declared \\"venerable\\" by Pope Pius XI. On 23 July 1588 some of the decisive action in the naval battle against the Spanish Armada took place within sight of the island, off Portland. Afterwards the threat of Spanish attacks remained, and the outer fortifications of Carisbrooke Castle were built between 1597 and 1602. In the late 16th century the bubonic plague arrived in Newport. God's Providence House is traditionally the only house in the town where no-one died. Three of Queen Elizabeth I's most influential courtiers came from Newport: Dr Edes, her chaplain, Dr James, her doctor, and Thomas Fleming, who became Lord Chief Justice and presided over the trial of Guy Fawkes in 1606. 17th and 18th centuries Towards the end of the English Civil War in November 1647, Charles I rode out from London to avoid capture by the army, hoping to escape to Jersey. He became lost in the New Forest, missed the intended ship, and so fled to the Isle of Wight. But its Governor Colonel Robert Hammond had already declared for Parliament, and so he imprisoned Charles in Carisbrooke Castle. The king made several failed attempts to escape, one time famously getting stuck in a castle window. He also had letters smuggled out, most of which were intercepted, which he signed 'J' to disguise his identity (donkeys operating the castle's water-well have subsequently been given names beginning with 'J'). In September 1648 he discussed the Treaty of Newport with the Presbyterian faction of Parliament, which would have granted him a constitutional monarchy. However, he had no intention of accepting its restrictions, and so also conspired for the Scots to invade England on his behalf. This led to his eventual execution on 30 January 1649. In 1669, Sir Robert Holmes became governor, and re-organised the island's defences. Yarmouth's castle was reduced in size, and he built a house for himself alongside, now the George Hotel. His position as the local vice- admiral entitled him to two-thirds of the value of any prizes captured in home waters, and he preyed enthusiastically on foreign ships that happened to sail nearby. On one of his raids he captured a part-completed statue of the French king, and had a likeness of his own head attached instead.BBC DNA page about Robert Holmes During the Seven Years' War, the island was used as a staging post for British troops departing on expeditions against the French coast, such as the Raid on Rochefort. During 1759, with a planned French invasion imminent, a large force of soldiers was stationed there. The French called off their invasion following the Battle of Quiberon Bay. Early 19th century The famous boat-building firm of J. Samuel White was established on the Island in 1802. Other noteworthy marine manufacturers followed over the 19th and 20th centuries including Saunders-Roe a key manufacturer of the Flying-boats and the world's first hovercraft. The tradition of maritime industry continues on the Island today. The famous Regency architect John Nash lived on the island, and designed Newport's Guidhall, completed in 1816. It now houses the island's history museum. Victorian era In the 1860s, what remains in real terms the most expensive ever government spending project saw fortifications built on the island and in the Solent, as well as elsewhere along the south coast, including the Palmerston Forts, The Needles Batteries and Fort Victoria, because of fears about the strength of the French and their possible invasion. Queen Victoria spent childhood holidays on the island and became fond of it. When Queen she made Osborne House her winter home, and so the island became a fashionable holiday resort for many Victorians, including Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Julia Margaret Cameron, and Charles Dickens (who wrote much of David Copperfield there), as well as the French painter Berthe Morisot and members of European royalty (many of whom were family relations). Until then, the island had been rural, with most people employed in farming, fishing or boat- building. The boom in tourism, spurred by growing wealth and leisure time, and by Victoria's example, led to significant urban development of the island's coastal resorts; the island saw significant expansion as many new homes and hotels were built. Queen Victoria died at Osborne House on 22 January 1901, aged 81. During her reign, the world's first radio station was set up by Marconi in 1897 at the Needles Battery, at the western tip of the island. In 1898 the first paid telegram (called a 'Marconigram' at the time) was sent from this station, and the island is now the home of the National Wireless Museum, near Ryde. Modern history In the mid- to late-nineteenth century, a sizeable network of railways was built on the island, notable for its punishing gradients and numerous tunnels, particularly to reach the town of Ventnor. Since the early twentieth century, these lines were often linked to plans for a tunnel under the Solent, an idea still talked of today. Most of the rail network closed between 1956 and 1966, and is now a series of cyclepaths. During the Second World War the island was frequently bombed. With its proximity to German-occupied France, the island had a number of observation stations and transmitters, as well as the RAF radar station at Ventnor. It was the starting-point for one of the earlier Operation Pluto pipelines to feed fuel to Europe after the Normandy landings. The Needles Battery was used to develop and test the Black Arrow and Black Knight space rockets, which were subsequently launched from Woomera, Australia. Statue of Jimi Hendrix outside Dimbola Lodge The Isle of Wight Festival was a very large rock festival that took place near Afton Down, West Wight in 1970, following two smaller concerts in 1968 and 1969. The 1970 show was notable both as one of the last public performances by Jimi Hendrix and for the number of attendees, reaching by some estimates 600,000. The festival was revived in 2002 in a different format, and is now an annual event. The first Governor to hold the crown representative title used now of Lord-Lieutenant was Lord Mountbatten of Burma until his murder in 1979. Lord Mottistone was the last Lord Lieutenant to also hold the title Governor (from 1992 to 1995). Since 1995 there has been no Governor appointed and Mr Christopher Bland has been the Lord Lieutenant. Political history The island's most ancient borough was Newtown on the large natural harbour on the island's north-western coast. A French raid in 1377, which destroyed much of the town as well as other Island settlements, sealed its permanent decline. By the middle of the 16th century it was a small settlement long eclipsed by the more easily defended town of Newport. Elizabeth I breathed some life into the town by awarding two parliamentary seats but this ultimately made it one of the most notorious of the Rotten Boroughs. By the time of the Great Reform Act that abolished the seats, it had just fourteen houses and twenty-three voters. The Act also disenfranchised the borough of Yarmouth and replaced the four lost seats with the first MP for the whole Isle of Wight; Newport also retained its two MPs, though these were reduced to one in 1868 and eventually abolished completely in 1885. Often thought of as part of Hampshire, the Isle of Wight was briefly included in that county when the first county councils were created in 1888. However, a \\"Home Rule\\" campaign led to a separate county council being established for the Isle of Wight in 1890, and it has remained separate ever since. Like inhabitants of many islands, Islanders are fiercely jealous of their real (or perceived) independence, and confusion over the Island's separate status is a perennial source of friction. It was planned to merge the county back into Hampshire as a district in the 1974 local government reform, but a last minute change led to it retaining its county council. However, since there was no provision made in the Local Government Act 1972 for unitary authorities, the Island had to retain a two-tier structure, with a county council and two boroughs, Medina and South Wight. The borough councils were merged with the county council on 1 April 1995, to form a single unitary authority, the Isle of Wight Council. The only significant present-day administrative link with Hampshire is the police service, the Hampshire Constabulary, which is joint between Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. From the closing decades of the 20th century onwards, there has been considerable debate on the Island over whether or not a bridge or tunnel should connect the island with mainland England. The Isle of Wight Party campaigned from a positive position, although extensive public debate on the subject revealed a strong body of opinion amongst islanders against such a proposal. In 2002 the Isle of Wight Council debated the issue and made a policy statement against the proposal.

The archipelago lies to the southeast of Stewart Island/Rakiura, and to the northeast of Campbell Island. They are very close to being the antipodal point to Normandy in France, meaning that the furthest away city from here is Cherbourg, France. The island group consists of one main island, Antipodes Island, of area, Bollons Island to the north, and numerous small islets and stacks. The islands are listed with the New Zealand Outlying Islands. The islands are an immediate part of New Zealand, but not part of any region or district, but instead Area Outside Territorial Authority, like all the other outlying islands except the Solander Islands. Ecologically, the islands are part of the Antipodes Subantarctic Islands tundra ecoregion. The islands are inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, together with other subantarctic New Zealand islands. The island group is a nature reserve and there is no general public access.

Over time the name has been shortened to \\"Antipodes\\". The island's actual antipodes are situated on the territory of the French village Gatteville-le-Phare, near Cherbourg. Blog post, not WP:RS Geography Topographical map The volcanic Antipodes Islands lie southeast of Stewart Island/Rakiura. They consist of a main island (Antipodes Island), area , surrounded by a series of small offshore islands and rocks. These islands include Bollons Island, at the second largest in the group, to the northeast of the main island's North Cape, and the nearby smaller Archway Island; Leeward Island, situated just off the centre of the main island's east coast (to which it is connected by a rocky bar at low tide); the two Windward Islands, situated apart, the easternmost of which is to the immediate north of Cave Point, the main island's westernmost point; and the tiny Orde Lees Islet, located close to the main island's northwestern shore. Numerous small islets and stacks further surround the coast of the main island. The islands are steep, and cliffs and rocky reefs line the majority of the coasts. The highest point is Mount Galloway at in the north of the main island, which also forms part of the group's most recently active volcano. Mount Waterhouse, to Galloway's southwest, also reaches over . Several other heights on the main island reach above , as does the highest point of Bollons Island. A ridge of peaks, the Reliance Ridge, runs along the main island's south coast. Several small streams run from the slopes of the main island's peaks, with the largest of these being the Dougall Stream, which runs northeast from the eastern slopes of Mount Waterhouse to reach the east coast not far from its closest point to Leeward Island. The Ringdove Stream runs east along the northern flanks of the Reliance Ridge to reach the large, rocky Ringdove Bay in the southeast of the main island. A further prominent stream runs southwest from the northwestern slopes of Mount Waterhouse to reach Stack Bay to the south of the Cave Point Peninsula, and a fourth runs north from the slopes of Mount Galloway, reaching the sea to the west of North Cape, close to Reef Point. History =Prehistory= There is no archaeological evidence of human visitation prior to European discovery of the islands. Descriptions of a shard of early Polynesian pottery having been discovered below the surface on the main island in 1886, and housed in the collections of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa are unsubstantiated. The Museum has not been able to locate such a shard in its collection, and the original reference to the object in the Museum's collection documentation indicates no reference to Polynesian influences. =Sealing= The island group was discovered in 1800 by Captain Henry Waterhouse commanding HMS Reliance. Matthew Flinders was first lieutenant, and his younger brother Samuel, was a midshipman on the vessel: Samuel prepared the chart of the islands.Rowley Taylor, Straight through from London: the Antipodes and Bounty Islands, New Zealand, Christchurch, Heritage Expeditions New Zealand, 2006, p.34. Waterhouse reported the presence of seals. In 1803 Waterhouse's brother-in-law George Bass applied to Governor Philip Gidley King of New South Wales for a fishing monopoly from a line bisecting southern New Zealand from Dusky Sound to the Otago Harbour to cover all the lands and seas to the south, including the Antipodes Islands, probably because he knew the latter were home to large populations of fur seals.Keith Macrae Bowden, George Bass, 1771-1803: his discoveries, romantic life and tragic disappearance, Melbourne, Oxford University Press, 1952, pp.118-119. Bass sailed from Sydney to the south that year and was never heard of again but his information led to a sealing boom at the islands in 1805 to 1807. In February 1805, the first sealing gangs arrived on the island from the American schooners Favorite and Independence.The Sydney Gazette, 5 May 1805; 16 March 1806. They killed about 60,000 seals over the course of the year they were stationed on the islands. Isle Penantipode, discovered by HMS Reliance, H.Waterhouse, commander. 25 March 1800. Chart by Samuel Flinders. At one time eighty men were present; there was a battle between American and British-led gangs and a single cargo of more than 80,000 skins‚Äîone of the greatest ever shipped from Australasia‚Äîwas on-sold in Canton for one pound sterling a skin, a multimillion-dollar return in modern terms. Prominent Sydney merchants such as Simeon Lord, Henry Kable and James Underwood were engaged in the trade as well as the Americans Daniel Whitney and Owen Folger Smith. William W. Stewart, who claimed to have charted Stewart Island, and probably William Tucker who started the retail trade in preserved Maori heads, were present during the boom. After 1807, sealing was occasional and cargoes small, no doubt because the animals had been all but exterminated.Peter Entwisle, Taka: a Vignette life of William Tucker 1784-1817: Convict, Sealer, Trader in Human Heads, Otago Settler, New Zealand's First Art Dealer, Dunedin, Port Daniel Press, 2005, p.40-41. =Shipwrecks= 's survivors landed at South Bay A much later attempt to establish cattle on the islands was short-lived (as were the cattle). When the ship (with a crew of 16) foundered off the main island's coast in 1893, the eleven surviving crew spent nearly three months living as castaways on the island, living on raw muttonbirds, mussels and roots for 87 days before gaining the attention of the government steamer by a flag made from their sail. Castaway hut at Antipodes' northern end A well-supplied castaway depotItems from the 1880s depot recovered in 1947 and now in the collection of the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa was available on the other end of the island, but the survivors' weak condition and the island's mountainous terrain prevented them from searching for depots. The depot was found and used by the crew of the French barque President Felix Faure, wrecked in Anchorage bay in 1908, who were stranded for sixty days until rescued by . The last wreck at the Antipodes was the yacht Totorore with the loss of two lives, Gerry Clark and Roger Sale, in June 1999. =Nuclear testing proposals= In 1955 the British Government required a large site remote from population centres to test the new thermonuclear devices it was developing. Various islands in the South Pacific and Southern Oceans were considered, along with Antarctica. The Admiralty suggested the Antipodes Islands. Arnold & Pyne 2001, p. 96. Flora and fauna Penguin colony in Anchorage Bay The flora of the islands has been recorded in detail, and includes megaherbs. The islands are also home to numerous bird species including the endemic Antipodes snipe, Antipodes parakeet, Reischek's parakeet, as well as several albatrosses, petrels and penguins, including half of the world population of the erect- crested penguin. Original population of fur seals seems to be regionally extinct or in serious peril where \\"Upland Seals\\" once found on Antipodes and Macquarie Island have been claimed as a distinct subspecies with thicker furs by scientists although it is unclear whether these seals were genetically distinct. =Important Bird Area= The Antipodes group has been identified as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because of its significance as a breeding site for several species of seabirds. The seabirds are southern rockhopper and erect-crested penguins, Antipodean, black-browed, light-mantled and white-capped albatrosses, and northern giant, grey and white-chinned petrels.BirdLife International. (2012). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Antipodes Islands. Downloaded from on 27 January 2012. Conservation As with many other islands, introduced rodents have caused problems by preying on the indigenous wildlife. A \\"Million Dollar Mouse\\" campaign was launched in 2012 to raise funds for an eradication programme as part of the New Zealand government's \\"Predator Free 2050\\" project. In the winter of 2016, the Department of Conservation carried out bait drops totalling 65 tonnes from three helicopters, and searched with trained dogs for any remaining rodents, which eliminated the estimated 200,000 mice on Antipodes Island. The island group is surrounded by the Moutere Mahue / Antipodes Island Marine Reserve.

Their music has a strong melodic content, often laced with Eastern European themes, and is highlighted by the use of dynamics and extended thematic development. There is a great deal of interplay among the lead instruments of flute, guitar and keyboard which is used regularly to develop their themes. The emphasis is not on providing solo spots for the various instruments, but rather in employing those instruments within the context of the development of the individual piece. The band's name is a reference to Stanis≈Çaw Lem's philosophical Sci-Fi novel, Solaris. Their first album's title is a reference to The Martian Chronicles. The members have said that they were influenced by these, and other Sci-Fi books. The majority of Solaris' songs are instrumentals. The first track on their first LP, Marsb√©li Kr√≥nik√°k, is an exception, with a few lines spoken over the music. The pitch-shifting, distortion, and album's theme have led many listeners to assume that the voiceover is in a putative Martian language, but it's actually in Hungarian: \\"Megrepedt t√ºkr√∂k (Cracked mirrors) / Kormos ac√©lfalak (Sooty steel walls) / Halott szem√©thegyek (Dead piles of garbage) / √âs szennyes tavak (And polluted lakes) / Azt mondod, itt √©lt valaha az ember? (Do you say mankind used to live here?)\\". \\"Eg√©szs√©ges Optimizmus\\" (Healthy Optimism) from the SOLARIS 1990 LP also has an introductory voiceover in Hungarian, and chanting in Latin appears in several tracks on the album Nostradamus: Pr√≥f√©ci√°k k√∂nyve. From 1986 to 1990, members of Solaris formed a new band, Napoleon Boulevard, with singer Lilla Vincze. The band had a more mainstream rock sound, and released five highly successful albums. In June 2003, Attila Koll√°r said in an interview that the band is still active, and they will start working on a new studio album that year. Following their studio albums (and a live double CD recorded in 1995 during the Progfest in Los Angeles), the band also started a 3-volume \\"Official Bootleg\\" series. As the title says, these contain recordings that were never officially released before and consist of mainly live material. The title track of the second volume was originally intended to appear on the first album but has never been recorded in the studio. In December 2007, drummer L√°szl√≥ G√∂m√∂r told Alternative Press magazine that \\"the band has made few attempts to reunite and it seems unlikely (Solaris) will reunite.\\" Recently, it was announced that a brand new studio album 'Martian Chronicles II.' will be released on October 26, 2014.http://www.solaris.hu/index_eng.htm Members *Erd√©sz, R√≥bert - keyboards (1980-) *Koll√°r, Attila - flute (1980-) *G√∂m√∂r, L√°szl√≥ - drums (1982-) *Kisszab√≥, G√°bor - bass (1980-1982,1995-) *Bogd√°n, Csaba - guitars (1981-1982,1995-) Past members *Czigl√°n, Istv√°n (deceased 1998) - guitars (1980-1998) *Rauschenberger, Ferenc - drums (1981-1982) *Seres, Attila - bass (1980) *T√≥th, Vilmos - drums (1980-1981) *P√≥cs, Tam√°s - bass (1982-2011) Discography *Solaris (SP), 1980 *Counterpoint (SP), 1981 *Marsb√©li Kr√≥nik√°k (Martian Chronicles) (LP), 1984 *SOLARIS 1990 (double LP, double CD), 1990/1996 *Live in Los Angeles (double CD), 1996 *Nostradamus: Pr√≥f√©ci√°k k√∂nyve (Nostradamus: Book of Prophecies) (CD), 1999 *Solaris arch√≠v 1. - Back to the roots...

As a player, Detmer won the Heisman Trophy in 1990 while playing quarterback for Brigham Young University (BYU). He went on to play professionally in the National Football League (NFL) for fourteen seasons. He was the offensive coordinator at BYU from 2015 to 2017. At BYU, Detmer broke numerous NCAA records and was twice recognized as a consensus All-American. A late-round pick in the 1992 NFL Draft, Detmer played for six NFL teams, mostly in a back-up role. He is the older brother of former NFL quarterback Koy Detmer. Early years Detmer was born in San Marcos, Texas.National Football League, Historical Players, Ty Detmer. Retrieved February 24, 2012. He attended Hobby Middle School, Mount Sacred Heart Middle School, and United Middle School in Laredo, Texas, and Southwest High School in San Antonio, Texas.databaseFootball.com, Players, Ty Detmer . Retrieved February 24, 2012. He earned letters in golf, football, basketball, baseball, and track. As a senior, Detmer won high school All-American honors in football and was the Texas Player of the Year. He also won all-state honors in baseball and all- district accolades in basketball. College career Detmer attended BYU, where he played for the BYU Cougars football team from 1987 to 1991. In deciding which college to attend, he was in part attracted by BYU's alcohol- free environment. He redshirted for the Cougars during the 1987 season, and shared quarterback duties with Sean Covey as a redshirt freshman in 1988. Detmer started only one game that year, but he made the most of the opportunity, passing for 333 yards and five touchdowns in a 65-0 victory over New Mexico. Later, he was named Most Valuable Player of the 1988 Freedom Bowl, after entering the game as a substitute and leading BYU to a come-from-behind 20‚Äì17 victory over the Colorado Buffaloes. Detmer became the full-time starter in 1989. He emerged as one of the top quarterbacks in the nation, passing for 4,560 yards and 32 touchdowns during the regular season. His passer rating of 175.6 led the NCAA, and he finished second to Houston's Andre Ware in total offense. He led BYU to a Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Championship, the team's first since 1985. Detmer finished the season with a strong performance against Penn State in the 1989 Holiday Bowl, setting NCAA records for most passing yards (576) and most yards of total offense (594) in a single bowl game. He finished ninth in the Heisman Trophy voting. Detmer's 1990 junior season ranks as one of the greatest seasons for a quarterback in college football history. He passed for 5,188 yards and 41 touchdowns in 12 regular season games, and finished the year with 42 NCAA records (and tied for five others). The highpoint of the season was BYU's 28-21 upset victory over the top-ranked Miami Hurricanes; Detmer led the Cougars by passing for 406 yards and three touchdowns against the defending national champions. For his performance that season, he was awarded the Heisman Trophy, as well as many other honors including the Maxwell and Davey O'Brien awards. He was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American, having been named to the first teams of the Associated Press, UPI, Newspaper Enterprise Association, Football Writers Association of America, Walter Camp Foundation, Football News, Scripps Howard, and the Sporting News. Unfortunately for Detmer and BYU, the season ended in disastrous fashion: the Cougars lost 59-28 in their final regular season game against Hawaii, then lost 65-14 to Texas A&M; in the 1990 Holiday Bowl. Detmer was knocked out of the game against Texas A&M;, suffering two separated shoulders that required off-season surgery. The 1991 season started poorly for BYU, as the Cougars lost their first three games (on a neutral field against #1 Florida State and road contests against #23 UCLA and #12 Penn State). After an 0‚Äì3 start, Detmer and BYU turned things around. The Cougars won eight straight games, and clinched their third consecutive WAC championship with a 52‚Äì52 tie against San Diego State in their final regular season road game. In that contest, BYU fell behind 45‚Äì17 before Detmer led a comeback. He finished the game with 599 passing yards and six touchdowns, both career highs. In his final game as a Cougar, Detmer passed for 350 yards to lead BYU to a 13‚Äì13 tie against heavily favored #7 Iowa in the 1991 Holiday Bowl. He totaled 4,031 passing yards and 35 touchdowns in regular season play during his senior year. He finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting, but won the Davey O'Brien Award again and also earned the Sammy Baugh Trophy and Today's Top VI Award. Additionally, he was again recognized as a consensus first-team All-American. Detmer finished his college career with the following totals: 1,530 pass attempts; 958 completions; 15,031 passing yards; 121 touchdown passes; 14,665 yards of total offense; 135 touchdowns responsible for; and 162.7 passer rating--all NCAA records at the time. In total, he finished his college career with 59 NCAA records and tied for three others. Including statistics from bowl games, Detmer amassed 16,206 passing yards and 127 touchdown passes at BYU. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in recreation administration. In 2012, Detmer was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Professional career =Green Bay Packers= Despite his success at BYU, many analysts thought that Detmer was too small to play quarterback in the NFL. The Green Bay Packers drafted him in the ninth round (230th pick overall) of the 1992 NFL Draft.Pro Football Hall of Fame, Draft History, 1992 National Football League Draft. Retrieved February 24, 2012. Detmer spent four seasons with the Packers, but appeared in only seven games while serving as back-up to starter Brett Favre.Pro-Football-Reference.com, Players, Ty Detmer. Retrieved February 24, 2012. =Philadelphia Eagles= Detmer found more playing time after signing a free agent contract with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1996. After Rodney Peete suffered a knee injury, Detmer became the team's starting quarterback. Detmer posted a 4‚Äì0 record in his first four starts. In his first start against the division rival New York Giants, Detmer completed 18 of 33 passes for 170 yards and no interceptions in the 19‚Äì10 victory. In his second start, he threw four touchdown passes (all to Irving Fryar) against the Miami Dolphins. The following week, he passed for a career-high 342 yards against the Carolina Panthers. The next week, he passed for 217 yards and a touchdown and added his first career rushing touchdown against the Dallas Cowboys. It was Philadelphia's first victory at Dallas since 1991, and earned Detmer the NFL Player of the Week award. A few weeks later, Detmer and the Eagles ended a three-game losing streak as they shut out the Giants in the rematch 24‚Äì0. Detmer threw three touchdowns in the win. For the year, Detmer passed for 2,911 yards and 15 touchdowns; his 80.8 passer rating ranked fourth among NFC quarterbacks. The Eagles posted a 7‚Äì4 record with Detmer as the starter during the 1996 season, good enough to enter the NFC playoffs. The following season, Detmer shared quarterback duties with Peete and Bobby Hoying. =San Francisco 49ers= Detmer left Philadelphia in 1998 and joined the San Francisco 49ers as a backup to Steve Young. He spent only one season in San Francisco. His lone start came against the Panthers in which he passed for 276 yards and 3 touchdowns in the 49ers' 25‚Äì23 victory. He mostly held the ball on field goals and PAT attempts, mostly. =Cleveland Browns= Detmer was traded to the Cleveland Browns in 1999; the Browns wanted him to mentor rookie quarterback Tim Couch. Detmer started the first game of the 1999 season, then served as backup until Couch sprained his foot in week 15. He started the final game of the 1999 season. Detmer injured his right Achilles and was inactive the entire 2000 season. =Detroit Lions= Detmer spent three seasons (2001 to 2003) with the Detroit Lions where he started four games during the 2001 season. His first start was a disaster: he threw seven interceptions against the Browns, the second-highest single-game total in NFL history (tied with seven other players). He was eventually replaced as starter, but did start the final two games of the season. He set career highs for attempts (50) and completions (31) against the Chicago Bears, finishing with 303 passing yards. He closed out the season with 242 yards and 2 touchdowns against the Cowboys. =Atlanta Falcons= Detmer spent the 2004 and 2005 seasons with the Atlanta Falcons, but did not see any action as the third-string quarterback behind Michael Vick and Matt Schaub. In 14 total seasons in the NFL, Detmer played in 54 games (with 25 starts), totaling 6,351 yards passing with 34 touchdowns and 35 interceptions. Detmer did not officially retire from football at the time of his release from Atlanta, but he has not played since then. =Coaching career= In December 2009, he was appointed the new head football coach at St. Andrew's Episcopal School. In December 2015, Detmer became the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at BYU, under new head coach Kalani Sitake. On November 27, 2017, Detmer was released from the coordinator position after just two seasons.Sean Walker Ty Detmer out as offensive coordinator, remains under contract at BYU, KSL.com, accessed November 29, 2017 The dismissal came following BYU football's poor performance over the previous year. Personal life Detmer's brother Koy is a former NFL quarterback, and their father Sonny is a prominent San Antonio high school coach. Detmer was a major investor in, and employed by, the Athlete Services Division at Triton Financial Corporation from 2007 to 2009. After the firm collapsed, founder Kurt Barton was indicted for fraud. Detmer, who was not implicated in the scandal, claims to have lost more money than anyone else. Overly trusting of Barton, whom he met at church, Detmer became a victim of affinity fraud.

Description It is a large evergreen coniferous tree reaching tall, exceptionally with a trunk up to in diameter. It has a conic crown with level branches and drooping branchlets. The leaves are needle-like, mostly long, occasionally up to long, slender ( thick), borne singly on long shoots, and in dense clusters of 20‚Äì30 on short shoots; they vary from bright green to glaucous blue-green in colour. The female cones are barrel-shaped, long and broad, and disintegrate when mature (in 12 months) to release the winged seeds. The male cones are long, and shed their pollen in autumn. Etymology The botanical name, which is also the English common name, derives from the Sanskrit term devadƒÅru, which means \\"wood of the gods\\", a compound of deva \\"god\\" and dƒÅru \\"wood and tree\\". Cultural importance The deodar is the national tree of Pakistan. Among Hindus, as the etymology of deodar suggests, it is worshiped as a divine tree. Deva, the first half of the Sanskrit term, means divine, deity, or deus. DƒÅru, the second part, is cognate with (related to) the words durum, druid, tree, and true. Several Hindu legends refer to this tree. For example, Valmiki Ramayan reads: > ‚ÄùIn the stands of Lodhra trees,Symplocos racemosa Padmaka trees Wild > Himalayan Cherry and in the woods of Devadaru, or Deodar trees, Ravana is to > be searched there and there, together with Sita. [4-43-13]‚Äù '' Cultivation It is widely grown as an ornamental tree, often planted in parks and large gardens for its drooping foliage. General cultivation is limited to areas with mild winters, with trees frequently killed by temperatures below about , limiting it to USDA zone 7 and warmer for reliable growth. It can succeed in rather cool-summer climates, as in Stateline, Nevada, and Ushuaia, Argentina.http://treesneartheirlimits.blogspot.ca/ Leaves and female cone of Cedrus deodara. The most cold-tolerant trees originate in the northwest of the species' range in Kashmir and Paktia Province, Afghanistan. Selected cultivars from this region are hardy to USDA zone 7 or even zone 6, tolerating temperatures down to about . Named cultivars from this region include 'Eisregen', 'Eiswinter', 'Karl Fuchs', 'Kashmir', 'Polar Winter', and 'Shalimar'. Of these, 'Eisregen', 'Eiswinter', 'Karl Fuchs', and 'Polar Winter' were selected in Germany from seed collected in Paktia; 'Kashmir' was a selection of the nursery trade, whereas 'Shalimar' originated from seeds collected in 1964 from Shalimar Gardens, India (in the Kashmir region) and propagated at the Arnold Arboretum. C. deodara, and the two cultivars ‚ÄòFeelin‚Äô Blue‚Äô and ‚ÄòAurea‚Äô, have gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit (confirmed 2017). Uses =Construction material= 255x255px Deodar is in great demand as building material because of its durability, rot-resistant character and fine, close grain, which is capable of taking a high polish. Its historical use to construct religious temples and in landscaping around temples is well recorded. Its rot-resistant character also makes it an ideal wood for constructing the well-known houseboats of Srinagar, Kashmir. In Pakistan and India, during the British colonial period, deodar wood was used extensively for construction of barracks, public buildings, bridges, canals and railway cars. Despite its durability, it is not a strong timber, and its brittle nature makes it unsuitable for delicate work where strength is required, such as chair-making. = Herbal Ayurveda = C. deodara is used in Ayurvedic medicine. The inner wood is aromatic and used to make incense. Inner wood is distilled into essential oil. As insects avoid this tree, the essential oil is used as insect repellent on the feet of horses, cattle and camels. It also has antifungal properties and has some potential for control of fungal deterioration of spices during storage. The outer bark and stem are astringent. Close up of leaves. Because of its antifungal and insect repellent properties, rooms made of deodar cedar wood are used to store meat and food grains like oats and wheat in Shimla, Kullu, and Kinnaur district of Himachal Pradesh. Cedar oil is often used for its aromatic properties, especially in aromatherapy. It has a characteristic woody odor which may change somewhat in the course of drying out. The crude oils are often yellowish or darker in color. Its applications cover soap perfumes, household sprays, floor polishes and insecticides and is also used in microscope work as a clearing oil.  Chemistry  The bark of Cedrus deodara contains large amounts of taxifolin. The wood contains cedeodarin, ampelopsin, cedrin, cedrinoside, and deodarin (3‚Ä≤,4‚Ä≤,5,6-tetrahydroxy-8-methyl dihydroflavonol). The main components of the needle essential oil include Œ±-terpineol (30.2%), linalool (24.47%), limonene (17.01%), anethole (14.57%), caryophyllene (3.14%), and eugenol (2.14%). The deodar cedar also contains lignans and the phenolic sesquiterpene himasecolone, together with isopimaric acid. Other compounds have been identified, including (‚àí)-matairesinol, (‚àí)-nortrachelogenin, and a dibenzylbutyrolactollignan (4,4',9-trihydroxy-3,3'-dimethoxy-9,9'-epoxylignan).

The river is in the Lake Huron drainage basin and was named after Charles Rankin, who first surveyed the Bruce Peninsula. Course The Rankin River begins at Berford Lake about southeast of the community of Mar, and flows west over Berford Dam, then under Ontario Highway 6 to Isaac Lake, where it takes in the right tributary Albemarle Brook arriving from Sky Lake. The river heads south to Boat Lake where it receives the left tributary Clavering Creek at Jordan Bay. It heads south out of the lake over Rankin Dam, then southwest to its mouth at the Sauble River, just upriver of the community of Sauble Falls. In addition to the Rankin River drainage basin lying in the town of South Bruce Peninsula in Bruce County, portions of the tributary Clavering Creek drainage basin lie in Georgian Bluffs in Grey County. History During the 18th century, this river was part of a portage from Georgian Bay across the Bruce Peninsula used by fur traders. In the second half of the 19th century, large numbers of passenger pigeons nested along the river. The river is now popular for recreational canoeing and kayaking. Natural history The river hosts fish species such as bass, Bowfin, northern pike, pickerel and perch, as well as trout and salmon during their spawning seasons. Whereas the entire Rankin River drainage basin has excellent (greater than 35%) forest cover, the riparian zones have only fair (25% to 50%) forest cover.

The prehistoric trackway (\\"Jurassic Trackway\\") which linked the downlands of Wiltshire with the wolds of Yorkshire did cross the county having followed the top of the Northamptonshire uplands. Where the escarpment had broken down as it had in Northamptonshire and Leicestershire it is impossible to know what route was followed; however where the uplands formed a narrow belt the approximate line of it can be identified. It is likely to have been in use already in the early Bronze Age (c. 1900-1500 BC) but if not so early than certainly during the middle Bronze Age (1500-1000 BC). The route of the trackway passes near Husbands Bosworth and Tilton and further on passes into Lincolnshire where it follows Lincoln Edge before crossing the River Humber into Yorkshire.Hoskins Heritage, p. 18 Another prehistoric road came from the Fens and crossed the limestone plateau round Croxton Kerrial and Saltby, then went between Eastwell and Goadby Marwood and then southwestwards past Wartnaby and Six Hills to reach the Soar at Barrow. Possibly it continued into Charnwood Forest as Beacon Hill was probably an inhabited Bronze Age site, and possibly terminated at Bardon Hill.Hoskins Heritage, p. 19-20 Another ancient east to west road crossed the dry limestone plateau and provided a link between the Welland and the Trent. It begins at Stamford (whose name means \\"stone ford\\", a ford by which the Welland was crossed) following the line of Ermine Street (a Roman road) but diverges from the Roman road towards the left and rises to its summit of 500 feet near Buckminster; thereafter it crosses Saltby heath and goes by Three Queens to reach the Vale of Belvoir where its course cannot be identified. Beyond the vale it probably went through Long Bennington to the banks of the River Trent at or near Newark. This road may have been in use as early as the Bronze Age but if not so early then its use began in the early Iron Age. It remained in use in ancient British, Roman and early Anglian times.Hoskins Heritage, p. 20 Sewstern Lane (also known as The Drift) is an old road which was used throughout the Middle Ages, probably as the most direct way between the great fairs of Nottingham and Stamford. A more direct route came into use later via Stonesby and Waltham on the Wolds. Sewstern Lane became less used after the mid 17th century, apart from its use by the Earls of Rutland on their journeys to London from Belvoir. When coaches started to run in the later 17th century a different route was taken via Stretton, Colsterworth and Great Ponton since Sewstern Lane would have provided insufficient staging posts where food for men and horses would be available. It continued in use as a drove road for cattle until the advent of railways changed the means of transport.Hoskins Heritage, pp. 21-23 The plateau round Tilton was a meeting place for prehistoric tracks: one of these which is called in its latter stages Ridgemere Lane runs north of Cold Newton, by New York farm to the edge of the flood plain of the Wreak near Syston. Part of it coincides with parish boundaries, proof that it predates the delimiting of parishes in the pre-Conquest era. Another old way goes above Lowesby and South Croxton and comes down to the edge of the plain at Queniborough. No dating of these two tracks is possible except that they are pre-Roman in origin.Hoskins Heritage, p. 23 Another very old road, perhaps a true ridgeway of the Bronze Age, comes westwards from Stamford and follows a limestone ridge then goes by Edith Weston, Manton and Martinsthorpe (a deserted village) to enter Leicestershire near Withcote. It goes from there along the high ground through Halstead and so to Tilton. From Tilton it continues westward by Billesdon Coplow and the site of the abandoned village of Ingarsby; near Scraptoft it follows Scraptoft Lane and reaches the gravel terrace by the banks of the Soar where Leicester would in later times be founded. It is not certain that this was a through route in prehistoric times but it was such in the Middle Ages and was used by Leicester merchants to reach the fairs of Stamford.Hoskins Heritage, pp. 23-24 Roman roads The course of a former Roman road There are about 76 miles of Roman roads in the county: these are well marked on Ordnance Survey maps. Another Roman road, Watling Street, forms the county's boundary with Warwickshire. The longest single stretch of road is from High Cross to the vanished Roman station of Vernemetum. This passes through Leicester and is part of the Fosse Way, constructed about 46-48 AD. The section northwards to Vernemetum forms the present main road to Newark. The next road in age is Watling Street, which dates from 50-51 AD. The road from Leicester to Mancetter (Manduessum) was probably made some 20 years later than Watling Street. Parts of this route became disused in Anglo-Saxon times as that people established no villages nearby.Hoskins Heritage, pp. 24-26 Medieval roads and bridges The Seven Arch Bridge, Rearsby The Anglo-Saxons were not road makers but the paths and tracks which connected their villages with those nearby form the basis for the modern road system. There are some green tracks in the county of probable Anglo-Saxon origin which are also followed by parish boundaries (these are often called \\"The Mere\\", mere meaning boundary). One of these runs from Countesthorpe towards Gilmorton and another, long known as \\"The Old Mere\\", from the Wigston Magna - Newton Harcourt road nearly to Houghton on the Hill. In the 13th and 14th centuries various fairs and markets were established in some of the villages; those that prospered led to the villages becoming market towns. Between fair and market towns roads became established and communication was also aided by the building to bridges. Most of the medieval bridges of the county outside Leicester were built in the second half of the 13th century or very early in the 14th. None of these early stone bridges survives but there are some later ones in existence at Aylestone, Anstey, Enderby Mill (the road to it was diverted away when turnpikes were built) and Rearsby. These are of uncertain date but probably not earlier than the 15th century.Hoskins Heritage, pp. 26-28 =Rutland and Leicester= In 1974, due to the Local Government Act 1972, the county of Rutland was annexed to Leicestershire as a district, and Leicester's county borough status was abolished, it becoming a district also. In 1974, the Local Government Act 1972 abolished the county borough status of Leicester and the county status of neighbouring Rutland, converting both to administrative districts of Leicestershire. These actions were reversed on 1 April 1997, when Rutland and the City of Leicester became unitary authorities. Rutland became a distinct Ceremonial County once again, although it continues to be policed by Leicestershire Constabulary. Early history The earthworks of Leicestershire include hill-top camps of the 1st century BC and the sites of deserted villages abandoned in the later Middle Ages. There are hill-forts, Roman camps (e.g. Ratby), linear earthworks, castle-sites (e.g.Hallaton), moated homesteads and sites of deserted villages (e.g. Ingarsby). The remains of prehistoric burial mounds and tumuli are scanty. The county was sparsely populated up to the 10th century AD and a large part of it was thickly wooded areas of heavy clay. However, during the rest of the Middle Ages most of the land was progressively cleared and settled; so that it became populous and prosperous, but more so in the eastern half and in the southeast.Hoskins, W. G. (1950). The Heritage of Leicestershire. Leicester: City of Leicester Publicity Department. p. 1. Together with Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, Rutland and Northamptonshire Leicestershire was inhabited by the ancient British tribe formerly known as Coritani (now corrected to Corieltauvi). After the Roman conquest it was included in the province of Flavia Caesariensis. In Anglo-Saxon times the land was settled by the Middle Angles (i.e. the Angles between the East Angles and the Mercians) whose territory was later included in the kingdom of Mercia. From the reign of Egbert, King of Wessex, the kings of Wessex also ruled Mercia. The division of the kingdom into shires or counties was probably done about 800 or even earlier. During the incursions of the Danes the midlands were frequently plundered and laid waste.Curtis, John (1831). A Topographical History of the County of Leicester. Ashby-de-la-Zouch: W. Hextall. p. ix. After the Danish invasions it was included in the Danelaw, whose boundary ran on the south- western boundary of the shire. =Diocese= A bishopric of the Middle Angles was established here in 680, and the Anglo-Saxon cathedral was probably located close to (if not on the site of) the present cathedral. The original diocese fell victim to the invasion by the Danes around 870 and after the establishment of the Danelaw in 886 the diocese's seat was moved to Oxfordshire and, taking over the existing Diocese of Lindine (created in 678), became the Diocese of Dorchester. 20th century After the division of the Diocese of Lincoln in 1541 the county was part of the Diocese of Peterborough. In the 19th century there were suffragan bishops of Leicester whilst the county was still within the Diocese of Peterborough. The modern diocese of Leicester was founded on 12 November 1926 from the archdeaconries of Leicester and Loughborough and part of the Archdeaconry of Northampton, all from the Diocese of Peterborough. St Martin's Church, Leicester, was elevated as the cathedral of the new see. County symbol A straw fox at Long Whatton The crest of the county council, and the emblem of Leicestershire County Cricket Club, Leicester City FC and Leicestershire Scouts is the red fox. Leicestershire is considered to be the birthplace of fox hunting as it is known today. Hugo Meynell of Quorn, Master of the Quorn Hunt 1753‚Äì1800, is known as the father of fox hunting. Melton Mowbray and Market Harborough have associations with fox hunting, as has neighbouring Rutland.

For some time the entire county was called 'Lindsey', and it is recorded as such in the Domesday Book. Later, Lindsey was applied to only the northern core, around Lincoln; it was defined as one of the three 'Parts of Lincolnshire', along with Holland in the south-east and Kesteven in the south west. In 1888 when county councils were set up, Lindsey, Holland and Kesteven each were authorized to have separate \\"Part\\" councils. These survived until 1974, when Holland, Kesteven, and most of Lindsey were merged into Lincolnshire, and the northern part, with Scunthorpe and Grimsby, going to the newly formed non- metropolitan county of Humberside, along with most of the East Riding of Yorkshire. An additional local government reform in 1996 abolished Humberside, and the parts south of the Humber became the unitary authorities of North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire. These areas became part of Lincolnshire for ceremonial purposes, such as the Lord-Lieutenancy, but are not covered by the Lincolnshire police. These two authorities are in the Yorkshire and the Humber region of England. The remaining districts of Lincolnshire are Boston, East Lindsey, Lincoln, South Holland, South Kesteven, North Kesteven and West Lindsey. They are part of the East Midlands region. Stone Age During the Pleistocene epoch, Britain's climate alternated between long periods of extreme cold and relative warmth; at least the last three cold spells lead to glaciation, during which ice moved southwards across England.May 1976, pp. 10‚Äì13 Lincolnshire was covered by ice in the Anglian and Wolstonian glacial stages and the eastern parts of the county were glaciated during the Devensian.Membery, p. 1 Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers migrated to Britain at least 800,000 years ago, but evidence of early settlement in the Midlands is sparse, probably due to the ice disrupting remains.May 1976, pp. 22‚Äì23 Flint flakes at Kirmington in Lincolnshire have been traced to the Hoxnian interglacial, which fell between the Anglian and Wolstonian stages.May 1976, pp. 14‚Äì16‚ÄúHoxnian Stage‚Äù in Timothy Darvill, Concise Oxford Dictionary of Archaeology, 2nd ed., 2008; online ed. 2009, accessed 1 May 2015 Most of the other lower Palaeolithic finds in Lincolnshire are Acheulian hand-axes, which date from that period onwards.May 1976, p. 20; examples of which are flints found at Atterby Carr and BarlingsMembery, pp. 1‚Äì2 During the Ipswichian warm period after the Wolstonian, humans began fashioning Mousterian flint-axes, a specimen of which has been found at Risby Warren, near Scunthorpe in northern Lincolnshire.

Early beaker remains from around Scunthorpe and in the southern Wolds have been dated to the third millennium BC.May 1976, pp. 61‚Äì64 Excavations at Risby Warren have revealed a large amount of Bronze Age beaker pottery from the early 2nd millennium BC, while similar material has been identified around Scunthorpe, the southern Wolds and Ancaster.May 1976, pp. 65‚Äì68 Although Lincolnshire was once noted for its prehistoric burial mounds, modern farming has destroyed many of them; surviving beaker barrows include the Bronze Age sites at Tallington, Thoresway, Broughton, Cleethorpes, Willoughby and Stroxton, along with scattered tumuli in the Wolds.May 1976, pp. 68‚Äì82; see fig. 39 on p. 76 for a distribution map of certain and possible late Neolithic and Bronze Age barrows Middle to late Bronze Age discoveries include a hoard of swords and spearheads from Appleby, a gold torc from Low Burnham (in the British Museum), and a now lost gold \\"armlet\\" from Cuxwold.May 1976, pp. 95‚Äì101 Changes in vegetation occurred across Britain between roughly 1300 and 600 BC; in Lincolnshire, drier conditions caused pine trees to grow around the Fen edge, while oak forests were largely replaced with peat bogs or moorland. As a result, older settlements were abandoned and new ones began to emerge, leading to difficulties in identifying Bronze Age settlement and burial sites in the county.May 1976, p. 102 However, late Bronze Age hoards are known and one of them, from Nettleham, is in the British Museum; the hoard of bronzes from Bagmoor Farm, near Scunthorpe, indicates a continental influence on craftsmanship and it is likely that an antennae-pommelled sword from the River Witham was imported from Europe.May 1976, pp. 103‚Äì106\\"A bronze, antennae pommelled sword from the river Witham in Lincoln (no. 71118)\\".

A wooden trackway from this era has been found at Brigg in north Lincolnshire, nearby to where a wooden boat has been uncovered and tentatively dated to the mid-1st millennium BC.

Despite the comparatively small number and size of forts in Lincolnshire, the archaeologist Jeffrey May suggests that the landscape's suitability for farming and its prominent salt industry may have led to prosperity during the Iron Age.May 1976, p. 143 The more decorative late Iron Age finds include gold torcs from Ulceby, bronze terrets from Owmby and Whaplode, a bronze ornament from Dragonby, a strap link from Caythorpe and a sword and scabbard from the River Witham.May 1976, pp. 156‚Äì165 Parts of a war horn were also found in the Witham, but were melted down in the 18th century.May 1976, pp. 166‚Äì167 There was an \\"extensive\\" Iron Age settlement at Old Sleaford, where over 3,500 fragments of coin moulds have been discovered, the largest such find in Europe; it may have been a tribal centre, but never became a walled town under Roman rule.May 1976, pp. 176‚Äì179 The Ancaster-Sleaford region has a high concentration of settlement, which may be due to geographical factors and the presence of two north‚Äìsouth communication lines, Mareham Lane and Jurassic Way. Similarly, the northern Wolds were more densely inhabited; settlements at Kirmington and Dragonby have been excavated, while North Ferriby was a crossing on the Humber connected to the south by High Street.May 1976, pp. 179‚Äì182 The earliest coinage in Lincolnshire were gold copies of Gallo-Belgic types, but the distinctive South Ferriby type emerged as the dominant pattern in East Midlands and silver coins became much more common from the 2nd century BC.May 1976, pp. 194‚Äì199 The pre-Roman East Midlands were occupied by the Corieltauvi tribe. In his Geography, Ptolemy of Alexandria described Lindum (modern Lincoln) and Rage Koritanorum (Ratae Coritanorum, modern Leicester) and these were principal towns of the tribe. Whether other groups operated in the county is not clear and it may be that the Catuvellauni controlled parts of southern Lincolnshire. The Roman arrival in AD 43 brought the Ninth Legion to the East Midlands to subjugate the native peoples; they may have reached the county by AD 45.May 1976, chap. 8  Roman  The Romans established permanent government in Lincolnshire soon after their invasion of AD 43. The tyrannical rule of the Roman sub-pr√¶tor Ostorius Scapula so inflamed the Corieltauvi and their neighbours in Yorkshire, the Brigantes, that the two peoples conducted a simmering, low-key rebellion lasting well into AD 70. Eventually, the Governorship of Britain was given to the Deputy of the Prefect of Gaul, and the title Vicar of Britain created. He resided at York. The sub- district of Flavia Caesariensis, which comprised Lincolnshire and parts of the Midlands, was created. Once established, the Romans worked to develop infrastructure in Lincolnshire. They built the Car Dyke, a series of semi- natural and artificial boundary ditches which run from the River Welland at Market Deeping for 64 km to the River Witham at Washingborough, constructed hard standings and walkways across the Fens, and also built inland ports, such as the Brayford Pool at Lincoln. The main Roman forts in Lincolnshire were: * Ancaster * Brant Broughton (Briga) * Caistor * Broughton (Praetorium) * Horncastle * Kirton in Lindsey (Inmedio) * Lincoln (Lindum Colonia) * Louth (Luda) * Ludford * Stow (Sidnacester) * Tattershall (Drurobrivis) * Torksey (Tiovulfingacester) * Wainfleet (Vainona) * Willoughby (Verometum) * Winteringham (Ad Abum) The Romans built three main roads through Lincolnshire: * Ermine Street (London to York via Stamford, Lincoln and Winteringham) * Fosse Way (Lincoln to Exeter) * Tillbridge Lane (Lincoln to York via Marton and Littleborough) Other roads of Roman origin are the Salters' Way, continuing the line from the Leicestershire border across Ermine Street near Old Somerby, to what was then coast at Donington. King Street, including The Long Hollow road, joined Ancaster to the fen edge and Durobrivae near Peterborough. Two roads linked Lincoln to the coast across the Wolds. This was used as part of the defence system set up to protect the Saxon Shore and re- used by William the Conqueror in conjunction with Lincoln Castle. Scores of smaller sections of roads branch off from the three major routes and are certainly Roman as well. They link Ermine Street with the Wolds, and King Street with the coast. Also, Mareham Lane continued the fen-edge line of King Street northwards. During the Roman period, north Lincolnshire produced the regional, coarseware ceramic Dales ware.Loughlin, N. 1977. 'Dales Ware: a contribution to the study of Roman coarse pottery', in Peacock (ed.) 1977. Pottery and Early Commerce: Characterisation and trade in Roman and Later Ceramics. London, 85‚Äì146  Early Middle Ages  Large numbers of people from Germanic-speaking areas of continental Europe settled in the area starting in the fifth century. Eventually, these became known as Angles, though they most likely did not migrate as part of a coherent tribal group.Toby F. Martin, The Cruciform Brooch and Anglo-Saxon England, Boydell and Brewer Press (2015), pp. 174-178Catherine Hills, The Anglo-Saxon migration to Britain: an archaeological perspective (2016) However, indications of a continuing presence of Britons in the region (such as place names) are stronger than in nearby East Anglia, and the transition from British to Anglo-Saxon control may have been peaceful. It has been suggested that Brittonic was spoken in some communities into the eighth century.Caitlin Green, The Origins of Louth: Archaeology and History in East Lincolnshire, 400,000 BC-AD 1086 (2014), pp. 66-67 The Kingdom of Lindsey was established between the Witham River and the Humber, in the northern part of what is now Lincolnshire, by the 6th century. It appeared to have maintained its independence until at least the end of the 7th century, but was absorbed by Mercia ‚Äì a rising power ‚Äì in the 8th century.Michael Lapididge (ed.), The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England (2001) p.289. In 865 a formidable Danish raiding army, led by Ivar (spelled \\"Hinguar\\" or \\"Igwar\\" in English sources), one of the sons of Ragnar Lothbrok, landed in East Anglia and established winter quarters there.Anglo- Saxon Chronicle; Dorothy Whitelock, \\"Fact and Fiction in the Legend of St Edmund\\" , Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology 31 (for 1969), pp. 217‚Äì33. Within a few years, this force succeeded in conquering Mercia and all the other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms except Wessex. Scandinavian settlers followed the raiders into the swathe of England under Danish control, which became known as the Danelaw. They have left a legacy of Scandinavian elements in many Lincolnshire place-names.Michael Lapididge (ed.), The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Englo-Saxon England (2001) pp. 369‚Äì371 and map 3. Lincoln became a Danish borough. In the 10th century, it was designated as the head of the new shire of Lincolnshire. Later Middle Ages The Anglo-Saxon nobility of Lincolnshire was destroyed by the Norman William the Conqueror, and the lands were divided amongst his followers. He constructed Lincoln Castle and another at Tattershall. Numerous others were built by Norman magnates, the first ones mainly in the years immediately following the Conquest. Another group of castles were built around 1140, during the period of civil war when Stephen and Matilda were disputing the right to rule. The First Battle of Lincoln, in 1141, was part of this conflict. The Witham valley between Boston and Lincoln was developed with the highest concentration of Christian abbeys and monastic foundations in England. The principal foundations were Barlings Abbey, Bardney Abbey, Catley Abbey, Nocton Priory, Stainfield Abbey, Stixwould Abbey, Tupholme Abbey, Kirkstead Abbey, Kyme Abbey. There were also monastic houses at Bourne Abbey, Sempringhm Abbey and many other places. But the clustering along the Witham was extraordinary. Fewer castles were built, although some of the manors were fortified in early years. Given the size of Lincolnshire, historians note the relative lack of castles, just as they do the plethora of abbeys along the Witham. Boston had seven friaries but it was defended only by the town walls. There appears to have been no garrison. Fairs at Stamford, Grantham, and Stow Fair were established, and lasted throughout the period. Corby Glen sheep fair has been held more or less unchanged annually since 1238. Sheep farming and the wool trade brought untold wealth to the area, and Boston was a major trading centre for wool. The wool trade and associated trades supported the construction of highly elaborate churches in the region. St. Botolph's Church in Boston has a tall tower spire that can be seen from miles around across land and sea. In this period the Queen's Champion was appointed, and the post is still held by his successor. Many great estates and schools were founded. The Middle Ages were as rich and colourful in Lincolnshire as anywhere else. But there were conflicts, such as accusations against the Jews and the Lincolnshire rebellion, in which lower classes struggled with constraints, show that life was not all a sybaritic idyll. An important medieval book, the Luttrell Psalter, was the source for nearly every schoolbook illustrations of the period. It lay unregarded in the church at Irnham until the early 20th century, when it was discovered and preserved for the nation. A public subscription in a popular newspaper raised enough money to buy the book before it was sold overseas. Grantham's St Wulfram's Church has a fine example of a chained library still extant within the church. Numerous churches were established in Lincolnshire that are dedicated to women saints; their names have been given to daughters of county families and passed down in a tradition continuing long after the Protestant Reformation. Early Modern During the Protestant reformation, Lincolnshire had strong pro-Catholic sentiments, and on 2 October 1536 an anti Anglican peasant rebellion broke out. The leaders of this rebellion were local peasants and Catholic priests. King Henry VIII responded by dispatching an army of 3,000 soldiers under the command of Sir John Russell and the duke of Suffolk to quell the rebellion. Despite the large number of the rebels (around 60,000), the rebellion was suppressed on 13 October. During the English Civil War, Lincolnshire was part of the Eastern Association, the Parliamentarian alliance. On its western border lay the Royalist strongholds, of Newark on Trent and Belvoir Castle. Lincolnshire was therefore raided and defended by the respective parties. For a time, Crowland, in the south of the county was fortified for the king. Lincolnshire was important to the Parliamentarians as it provided access between the great arsenal of Hull and the south and the Eastern Association's heartland in the east of England. It also offered a potential starting line for an advance across the English Midlands, cutting the north of England off from the west.Web links and list of references . Second World War =The RAF in the Second World War= In the late 1930s, despite its coastal holiday industry, distant and near water fishing industries, iron mining and smelting, heavy machinery manufacturing, the country's main road and railway lines and growing number of airfields, Lincolnshire was large enough to give an impression of being a largely unvisited, peaceful agricultural backwater until the Second World War, when its extent, gentle topography and relative proximity to the enemy led to a further expansion in the number of Royal Air Force stations in the county. By 1945 the number of RAF bases exceeded 46. Some of these had by that stage been lent to the Eighth United States Army Air Force. The very first airfields had been built for the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) or the Royal Naval Air Service, the first of them at Skegness, on the coast, in 1912, when the RFC was established. Among the more famous Royal Air Force stations in the county was and is RAF Cranwell. This had begun as The Royal Naval Air Service Central Training Establishment, Cranwell; commonly known as HMS Daedalus, commissioned 1 April 1916. It became the RAF Officer Training College after the formation of the RAF in April 1918. RAF Swinderby was a Polish-manned RAF station and from 1964, the RAF's main Recruit Training Camp. RAF Scampton, was the home base of 617 Squadron. Lincolnshire still has the strongest claim to being the 'home' of RAF Bomber Command, playing host to many squadrons, including the Lancaster bombers of the famous 617 Dambusters squadron who were based at RAF Scampton. There were two Bomber Groups based in the county ‚Äì No. 1 in the north and No. 5 Group in the centre and south. The Battle of Britain memorial flight is still led by a Lancaster named The City of Lincoln. Before the war, Sir Frank Whittle had attended RAF Cranwell, near Sleaford, in the late 1920s. Here he formulated his ideas for the jet engine. On 15 May 1941 the world's first true jet-engine flight took place at Cranwell, by the Gloster E.28/39. Most of the airfields were closed after the war and, although most have been built over, disused airfields, abandoned control towers and crumbling concrete bunkers and airfield buildings remain a physical feature of the county in a number of places, and many still, it is said, holding ghosts and are haunted. Many people in Lincolnshire have learned to drive a car on the disused concrete airstrips of the county. Cold War history RAF Waddington and RAF Scampton formed two of the main bases for the V bomber Force, flying Vulcans, during the Cold War, while Thor missiles were stationed on former wartime air stations at for example, RAF Folkingham.

The municipality encompasses the western portion of the island, with its municipal seat in the town of Velas on the south coast, and is divided into six parishes. The population in 2011 was 5,398,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 117.38 km¬≤.Eurostat History The City Gates of Velas, constructed during the 18th Century at the entrance to village at the Port of Velas The ruins of an old windmill, located on the Morro das Velas, along the south-west coast of the village of Velas The origin of the name Velas has never been clarified by historians, although it may refer to the number of sailing ships that congregated in the municipality (\\"velas\\" is Portuguese for sails), but may also refer to the \\"sails\\" of the windmills that populated the municipality during early settlement. There may also been confusing in the similarity between velas, the word velhas (which means \\"old\\" in Portuguese) or \\"belas\\" (which means \\"beautiful\\", in the same language). Another reference is to the Portuguese term \\"vilar\\", which means vigilant, and may have been used to situation in the Canal, where residents were ever-vigilant for volcanic eruptions and/or seismic events. The village of Velas is one of the oldest settled communities on the island, and has been traced back to the testimony of Infante D. Henrique, who referred to the 1460 when the community congregated around their church to the evocation of S√£o Jorge. Its administrative status was elaborated in 1500, when it became the municipal authority and main village in the western part of the island (Topo being the first municipality). It was in 1507 that Velas could be identified on a map of the island of S√£o Jorge as village. Similarly, the localities of Santo Ant√≥nio (Norte Grande), and in 1559 Manadas were first recognized as a major settlements in the municipality; both centers would become religious parishes in 1543 and 1568 respectively. It was also in 1568, that Rosais would be recognized as a parish. On the evening of April 28, 1580 (and during the following day), the ground would begin a series of about 80 earthquakes, that would cease abruptly. Nevertheless, on May 1 the tremors would return, followed by a volcanic explosion in the area of Queimada and later in the heights of Ribeira do Nabo, two kilometers east of the initial explosion. Volcanic lava was emitted along the Ribeira do Almeida and in Santo Amaro, and there was record of a pyroclastic flow that was responsible for the deaths of at least 10 people. This volcanic eruption lasted four months, and was responsible for many lava flows that travelled to the sea, and ash that fell as far as Terceira. During those months, 4000 cattle died due to gases and the lack of grazing lands, owing to the ash. Eight-years later, several floods would be responsible for the damage to many homes, while in 1593 agricultural production would fall, caused by a bad harvest. On December 21, 1641, the community of Velas was also the center of an up-well in ocean that '\\"clawed itself from the sea with such luck that it dominated Monte dos Fachos, with three tides\\"; this mini-tsunami, although never called this in the literature, caused destruction in the village, injuring 50 people and dragging personal items into the sea. By 1570, Velas had 1000 inhabitants, and later 2000 by the end of the 17th century. In 1822, there were 4200 residents in this municipality, but slowly these numbers diminished with several phases of emigration. Piracy had always been a problem in the canal that separated the islands of the central group. Consequently, forts, such as the Fort of Santa Cruz in Velas (1629), another fort in 1641 (later expanded in 1644) and the Fort of Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o were constructed to impede attacks. In 1647, the residents of the municipality also constructed a lookout in the parish of Manadas to watch for pirates, as well as to intimidate them: the erected a gallows on the site to ward-off potential attackers. On September 18, 1708 a naval squadron, commanded by the French corsair Ren√© Duguay-Trouin, that included eight carracks and three other heavily armed ships attacked the town of Velas, after being unable to enter the port. The first direct attack on the villagers was repelled by men under the command of Sergeant-major Amaro Teixeira de Sousa, who was able to thwart a landing on September 19. But, the next day a new attempt was made, wherein one group (that included six boats) was directed at the \\"doors to the city\\", while a larger group (that included ten boats) was sent to the Morro das Velas (in the western corner of the village). This second group disembarked near Arco a contingent of 500 men, while killing local residents. The French privateers remained in the village for five days, sacking the churches and main houses. Following this encounter, the residents constructed the Fort of Nossa Senhora do Pilar, also referred to as Castelo da Eira. In 1647, the parish of Urzelina separated from the parish of Manadas, owing to the existence of its natural port, which was important for the period of the \\"orange cycle\\", as well as off-shipment port for Verdelho and Terrenatez wines. Being a new focus of piracy, the citizens of Manadas constructed a gallows on a lookout to \\"dissuade\\" pirates. These improvements did not help during that year's earthquake in neighboring Terceira: as a result of the destruction both islands were affected by a period of famine, that was only alleviated through municipal supports. Between April 23, 1659 and its consecration in February 1675, the Church of S√£o Jorge undertook major renovations, initiated by Father Baltazar Dias Teixeira, under the authority of King D. Afonso VI of Portugal.Guia do Patrim√≥nia Cultural, 2003 In order to pay for this re-construction, which would replace a primitive chapel of 1460, the town council initiated an annual tax in 1660, and the actual building began in 1664. The completion of the temple, and its consecreation would be presided over by the Bishop of Angra do Hero√≠smo, D. Louren√ßo de Castro. While the taxes imposed on the population were likely an unintended necessity, the famine of 1678, caused by the failure of the cereal crop would lead to minor conflicts between the councils of Pico and S√£o Jorge. Similarly, the Taro Revolt, which started on July 12, 1694 would create internal divisions and tensions between the peasant and administrative classes on the island. In 1698, the locality of Santo Amaro was elevated to parish status. During the period of 1713 and 1714 the communities of Velas were affected by both a bad agricultural year and chaotic weather patterns. Famine and disease pursisted after a tropical cyclone in late summer (September 25, 1713), which caused \\"the loss of supplies that caused the deaths of many people from famine\\". Later, on December 11, 1713, heavy rains in the areas of Urzelina and Rosais caused the destruction of 27 homes; the Ribeira do Almeida (which ran between the village and Queimada) was so heavily inundated with debris that it allowed residents to walk across the field, which was a sheltered bay in other years. A similar disaster was repeated in December 1732, when flooding caused the deaths of five residents and affected the communities of Urzelina, Figueiras, Serroa and Velas. But, in 1755, at the same time that the Lisbon earthquake affected the Portuguese capital, a tsunami reached the southern coasts of the islands of the Azores. The southern ports and communities of Velas attacked by successive waves, destroying personal possessions and homes. Two years later, the Mandado de Deus (\\"The Sent of God\\") resulted in landslides, destruction of homes and many deaths. The earthquake was known for damaging the Church of Santa B√°rbara in Manadas, specifically (in 1770 it was declared a National Monument by royal decree of King D. Sebasti√£o, since it was constructed in 1485). The latter part of the 18th century, in addition to the reconstruction of many of the older temples (caused by the 1757 earthquake), was a period of many public works. In Manadas, the cornerstone for chapel of Santa Rita de C√°ssia was laid in 1757,The funds to begin the construction were donated by Captain Ant√£o de √Åvila Pereira, who left a sizable testament written on June 8, 1757. The project was completed the following year (1758). while in 1762 the Church of Nossa Senhora dos Neves over the older 17th-century chapel was constructed. Geography =Physical geography= Partial vista of the town of Velas, showing the southern coast and village of Urzelina in the distance, S√£o Jorge The municipality of Velas occupies half the island of S√£o Jorge, from the northwest coast to the interior around Pico Gordo. It is coincident with the Western regional geomorphological zone from Ponta dos Rosais until approximately the area of Ribeira Seca, and characterized by a cascade of escoria cones and axial deposits that extend along the plateau, formed from fissural volcanism that originates in faults extending from the center of the island which run parallel along a north-northwest to south-southeast axis. A secondary range of faults also extend slightly to the area around the town of Velas. The progress of fissural volcanism runs along these accesses, and has resulted in volcanic features that are younger than the rest of the island; two volcanic complexes have their origin in Velas: the Volcanic Complex of Rosais (which is less than 10 million years in age) and the Volcanic Complex of Manadas (the older system which is between 10 and 600 million years in age). This has resulted in vistas that are exemplified by high coastal cliffs and central plateau dotted by several spatter cones along the center, as well as faj√£s (geological debris fields or coastal deltas). The largest faj√£, which extends from the geological cones of Morro de Lemos and Morre Grande to the Bay of Velas, is occupied by the principal population center, the town of Velas. =Human geography= Typically, the municipality is circled by the western branch of the Regional E.R.1-1¬™ roadway that connects several of the main settled areas on this side of the island: in addition to the urbanized are of Velas, the western plateau is interrupted by the communities of S√£o Pedro, Ribeirinho, Canadinha Nova, Arrifana, Rosais, Loural, Santo Ant√≥nio, Norte Grande, Outeiro, Ribeira da Areia, Ladeiras, Manadas, Urzelina, Biscoitos, Boa Hora, Morgadias and Santo Amaro. The extreme coastal communities are relatively detached from the rest of these settlements, and include Faj√£ da Ribeira Areia, Faj√° do Ouvidor (the only faj√£ with road access), Faj√£ de Al√©m, Faj√£ Rasa, Faj√£ do Centelo, Faj√£ do Jo√£o Dias and Faj√£ das Almas. Administratively, the municipality of Velas encompasses six civil parishes (or freguesias) that operate day-to-day functions, while Velas handles municipal services such as development, water, electricity, public administration, security and civil institutions. The six parishes of the municipality are: * Manadas - located along the southern, with a population of less than 400 inhabitants, also known as the parish of Santa B√°rbara; * Norte Grande - on the border with Calheta, along the north coast, the small parish (688 inhabitants) is known for its two faj√£s: Faj√£ da Aeira and Faj√£ do Ouvidor; * Rosais - the parish that occupies the western point of the island of S√£o Jorge, it includes Ponta dos Rosais, and has a population of 820 residents in 2001; * Santo Amaro - neighboring the parish of Velas, it is the location of the island's airport with approximately 920 inhabitants in 2001; * Urzelina - site of the 1808 volcanic eruption that erupted from the center of the parish, and cascaded to the sea; today the parish is population of approximately 866 inhabitants; * Velas - the parish that includes the town of Velas, as well as the settlements along the Canadinha Nova and Ribeirinho, and includes 1929 residents.

Santa B√°rbara was one of the older parishes on S√£o Jorge, probably founded before 1550, when 250 inhabitants lived in the parish and when it began appearing in documents during the 16th Century. In 1568, it was included in a listing of six religious parishes that occupied the island of S√£o Jorge. At the time of its founding, it included an area vastly larger than its current borders with the communities of Urzelina, Terreiros and Faj√£ das Almas lying within its borders. At the beginning of 18th Century the population had grown to 500 residents. The Port of Manadas was marked by a lookout's hut, constructed in 1647, to monitor shipping the S√£o Jorge Channel. During the era of piracy, the locals would hang supposed pirates from this vantage point, as a warning to pirates or privateers of the consequences of attacking the village/municipality. Years later, the area of Manadas was the location of the Fort of Urzelina, which was used to protect the area. During the Orange Cycle (the economic period where local farmers produced citrus fruits for export) the lookout was used to warn of the arrival of cargo ships, and alerting them to have their produce in port for shipment. Later, the port was also the staging port for exports of Castelete wines to the European continent and England. Manadas was the birthplace of the ethnographer Jo√£o Teixeira Soares de Sousa, who greatly contributed to the histo-cultural development of the island. The parochial Church of Santa B√°rbara was constructed over an older temple that dated to the 15th Century. The remodelled architecture, which dates back to the 18th Century, includes rare golden ornamentation and is one example of the Baroque-style, popular in the Azores. Classified a national monument, it remains unaltered since its construction; includes original azulejo (dedicated to local quarrymen), its golden altars, an original roof (built with cedros) and original sacristy. In addition, the parish is populated with several other historical religious sanctuaries: Chapel of Santa Rita de C√°ssia, Chapel of Senhora da Guadalupe and Chapel of Santo Cristo. Geography Partial vista of the parish of Manadas showing the cliffs and settlement of Ladeiras from the coast near the Church of Santa B√°rbara Located 15 kilometres from the municipal seat of Velas, on the municipalities southern border with (Calheta); it is delimited by the S√£o Jorge Channel (on the southern coast), the civil parish of Urzelina (along the Ribeira Large) and the ridge of Pico da Esperan√ßa (in the civil parish of Norte Grande. The parish contains the localities Faj√£ das Almas, Ladeiras, Manadas and Ponta das Casteletes. The parish is populated by older cottages, orchards and fields in scattered settlements dispersed by mountainous cliffs, and highlighted by small coastal plains. The largest of these faj√£s, location of the parochial church and village port, is the largest settlement (Faj√£ das Almas), located in the middle of the southern coast. Its semi-planar surface is in contrast with the cliffs to the east which front the S√£o Jorge Channel, and has produced a micro-climate that has sustained many orchards and fields that produce coffee, wine, tropical fruits and species of Dragon trees (Dracaena draco) typical of the Canary Islands, Cape Verde and Madeira. Along the foothills, there are several springs and fountains that sustained early settlements, while the ports, including the Port of Terreiros was originally center for the fishing industry, but now used for sport and summer fishermen.

The parish of Norte Grande it has been one of the largest populations on the island; by 1570, its importance along the north coast justified the construction of a road into the areas around Neves. It was around the primitive parochial church of Norte Grande (the Church of Our Lady of the Snows), that the townsfolk encircled officials responsible for collecting the medieval tithes in 1694. This event was part of the Tarot rebellion, when tax collectors were sent to the island to collect a tithe for tarot cultivated. Indignant Calhetense gathered in Norte Grande, then encircled those officials in the church, who had taken refuge from the angry farmers, who refused to pay the excessive charge on a staple.

Northumberland Information Network http://www.northumberlandinfonet.org.uk/EconomicAssessment/documents/NorthumberlandsEconomy2009ExecutiveSummary.pdf Prehistory Rock art near West Horton As attested by many instances of rock art, the Northumberland region has a rich prehistory. Archeologists have studied a Mesolithic structure at Howick, which dates to 7500 BC and was identified as Britain's oldest house until it lost this title in 2010 when the discovery of the even older Star Carr house in North Yorkshire was announced, which dates to 8770 BC. They have also found tools, ornaments, building structures and cairns dating to the bronze and iron ages, when the area was occupied by Brythonic Celtic peoples who had migrated from continental Europe, most likely the Votadini whose territory stretched from Edinburgh and the Firth of Forth to Northumberland. It is not clear where the boundary between the Votadini and the other large tribe, the Brigantes, was, although it probably frequently shifted as a result of wars and as smaller tribes and communities changed allegiances. Unlike neighbouring tribes, Votadini farms were surrounded by large walls, banks and ditches and the people made offerings of fine metal objects, but never wore massive armlets. There are also at least three very large hillforts in their territory (Yeavering Bell, Eildon Hill and Traprain Law, the latter two now in Scotland), each was located on the top of a prominent hill or mountain. The hillforts may have been used for over a thousand years by this time as places of refuge and as places for meetings for political and religious ceremonies.\\"Ancient Tribes of Britain.\\" BBC. 2013.

Roman occupation A section of Shepherd's (1923) map of Roman Britain When Gnaeus Julius Agricola was appointed Roman governor of Britain in 78 AD, most of northern Britain was still controlled by native British tribes. During his governorship Agricola extended Roman control north of Eboracum (York) and into what is now Scotland. Roman settlements, garrisons and roads were established throughout the Northumberland region. The northern frontier of the Roman occupation fluctuated between Pons Aelius (now Newcastle) and the Forth. Hadrian's Wall was completed by about 130 AD, to define and defend the northern boundary of Roman Britain. By 142, the Romans had completed the Antonine Wall, a more northerly defensive border lying between the Forth and Clyde. However, by 164 they abandoned the Antonine Wall to consolidate defences at Hadrian's Wall. Two important Roman roads in the region were the Stanegate and Dere Street, the latter extending through the Cheviot Hills to locations well north of the Tweed. Located at the intersection of these two roads, Coria (Corbridge), a Roman supply-base, was the most northerly large town in the Roman Empire. The Roman forts of Vercovicium (Housesteads) on Hadrian's Wall, and Vindolanda (Chesterholm) built to guard the Stanegate, had extensive civil settlements surrounding them. The Celtic peoples living in the region between the Tyne and the Forth were known to the Romans as the Votadini. When not under direct Roman rule, they functioned as a friendly client kingdom, a somewhat porous buffer against the more warlike Picts to the north. The gradual Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century led to a poorly documented age of conflict and chaos as different peoples contested territories in northern Britain. = Archaeology = Nearly 2000-year-old Roman boxing gloves were uncovered at Vindolanda in 2017 by the Vidolanda Trust experts led by Dr Andrew Birley. According to the Guardian, being similar in style and function to the full-hand modern boxing gloves, these two gloves found at Vindolanda look like leather bands date back to 120 AD. It is suggested that based on their difference from gladiator gloves warriors using this type of gloves had no purpose to kill each other. These gloves were probably used in a sport for promoting fighting skills. The gloves are currently displayed at Vindolanda's museum. Anglian Kingdoms of Deira, Bernicia and Northumbria An illustration from the Lindisfarne Gospels Conquests by Anglian invaders led to the establishment of the kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia. The first Anglian settlement was effected in 547 by Ida, who, accompanied by his six sons, pushed through the narrow strip of territory between the Cheviots and the sea, and set up a fortress at Bamburgh, which became the royal seat of the Bernician kings. About the end of the 6th century Bernicia was first united with the rival kingdom of Deira under the rule of √Üthelfrith of Northumbria, and the district between the Humber and the Forth became known as the kingdom of Northumbria. After √Üthelfrith was killed in battle around 616, Edwin of Deira became king of Northumbria. √Üthelfrith's son Oswald fled northwest to the Gaelic kingdom of D√°l Riata where he was converted to Christianity by the monks of Iona. Meanwhile, Paulinus, the first bishop of York, converted King Edwin to Roman Christianity and began an extensive program of conversion and baptism. By his time the kingdom must have reached the west coast, as Edwin is said to have conquered the islands of Anglesey and Man. Under Edwin the Northumbrian kingdom became the chief power in Britain. However, when Cadwallon ap Cadfan defeated Edwin at Hatfield Chase in 633, Northumbria was divided into the former kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira and Christianity suffered a temporary decline. In 634, Oswald defeated Cadwallon ap Cadfan at the Battle of Heavenfield, resulting in the re-unification of Northumbria. Oswald re-established Christianity in the kingdom and assigned a bishopric at Hexham, where Wilfrid erected a famous early English church. Reunification was followed by a period of Northumbrian expansion into Pictish territory and growing dominance over the Celtic kingdoms of D√°l Riata and Strathclyde to the west. Northumbrian encroachments were abruptly curtailed in 685, when Ecgfrith suffered complete defeat by a Pictish force at the Battle of Nechtansmere. =Monastic culture= When Saint Aidan came at the request of Oswald to preach to the Northumbrians he chose the island of Lindisfarne as the site of his church and monastery, and made it the head of the diocese which he founded in 635. For some years the see continued in peace, numbering among its bishops Saint Cuthbert, but in 793 Vikings landed on the island and burnt the settlement, killing many of the monks. The survivors, however, rebuilt the church and continued to live there until 883, when, through fear of a second invasion of the Danes, they fled inland, taking with them the body of Cuthbert and other holy relics. Against this background, the monasteries of Northumbria developed some remarkably influential cultural products. C√¶dmon, a monk at Whitby Abbey, authored one of the earliest surviving examples of Old English poetry some time before 680. The Lindisfarne Gospels, an early example of Hiberno-Saxon visual art, is attributed to Eadfrith, the bishop of Lindisfarne from 698 to 721. Stenton (1971, p. 191) describes the book as follows. > In mere script it is no more than an admirable example of a noble style, and > the figure drawing of its illustrations, though probably based on classical > models, has more than a touch of na√Øvet√©. Its unique importance is due to > the beauty and astonishing intricacy of its decoration. The nature of its > ornament connects it very closely with a group of Irish manuscripts of which > the Book of Kells is the most famous. Bede's writing, at the Northumbrian monasteries at Wearmouth and Jarrow, gained him a reputation as the most learned scholar of his age. His work is notable for both its breadth (encompassing history, theology, science and literature) and quality, exemplified by the rigorous use of citation. Bede's most famous work is Ecclesiastical History of the English People, which is regarded as a highly influential early model of historical scholarship. Earldom of Northumbria The kingdom of Northumbria ceased to exist in 927, when it was incorporated into England as an earldom by Athelstan, the first king of a united England. In 937, Athelstan's victory over a combined Norse- Celtic force in the battle of Brunanburh secured England's control of its northern territory. The Scottish king Indulf captured Edinburgh in 954, which thenceforth remained in possession of the Scots. His successors made repeated attempts to extend their territory southwards. Malcolm II was finally successful, when, in 1018, he annihilated the Northumbrian army at Carham on the Tweed, and Eadulf the earl of Northumbria ceded all his territory to the north of that river as the price of peace. Henceforth Lothian, consisting of the former region of Northumbria between the Forth and the Tweed, remained in possession of the Scottish kings. The term Northumberland was first recorded in its contracted modern sense in 1065 in an entry in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle relating to a rebellion against Tostig Godwinson. Norman Conquest Hulne Priory, west of Alnwick. The vigorous resistance of Northumbria to William the Conqueror was punished by ruthless harrying, mostly south of the River Tees. As recounted by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: > A.D. 1068. This year King William gave Earl Robert the earldom over > Northumberland; but the landsmen attacked him in the town of Durham, and > slew him, and nine hundred men with him. Soon afterwards Edgar Etheling came > with all the Northumbrians to York; and the townsmen made a treaty with him: > but King William came from the South unawares on them with a large army, and > put them to flight, and slew on the spot those who could not escape; which > were many hundred men; and plundered the town. St. Peter's minster he made a > profanation, and all other places also he despoiled and trampled upon; and > the ethelling went back again to Scotland. The Normans rebuilt the Anglian monasteries of Lindisfarne, Hexham and Tynemouth, and founded Norman abbeys at Newminster (1139), Alnwick (1147), Brinkburn (1180), Hulne, and Blanchland. Castles were built at Newcastle (1080), Alnwick (1096), Bamburgh (1131), Harbottle (1157), Prudhoe (1172), Warkworth (1205), Chillingham, Ford (1287), Dunstanburgh (1313), Morpeth, Langley (1350), Wark on Tweed and Norham (1121), the latter an enclave of the palatine bishops of Durham. Northumberland county is not mentioned in the Domesday Survey, but the account of the issues of the county, as rendered by Odard the sheriff, is entered in the Great Roll of the Exchequer for 1131. In 1237, Scotland renounced claims to Northumberland county in the Treaty of York. During the reign of Edward I (1272‚Äì1307), the county of Northumberland was the district between the Tees and the Tweed, and had within it several scattered liberties subject to other powers: Durham, Sadberge, Bedlingtonshire, and Norhamshire belonging to the bishop of Durham; Hexhamshire to the archbishop of York; Tynedale to the king of Scotland; Emildon to the earl of Lancaster; and Redesdale to Gilbert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus. These franchises were exempt from the ordinary jurisdiction of the shire. Over time, some were incorporated within the county: Tynedale in 1495; Hexhamshire in 1572; and Norhamshire, Islandshire and Bedlingtonshire by the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844. * Council of the North The county court for Northumberland was held at different times at Newcastle, Alnwick and Morpeth, until by statute of 1549 it was ordered that the court should thenceforth be held in the town and castle of Alnwick. Under the same statute the sheriffs of Northumberland, who had been in the habit of appropriating the issues of the county to their private use, were required thereafter to deliver in their accounts to the Exchequer in the same manner as the sheriffs of other counties. Border wars, reivers and rebels Dunstanburgh Castle (built c. 1320) was garrisoned by the Lancastrians in 1462. From the Norman Conquest until the union of England and Scotland under James I and VI, Northumberland was the scene of perpetual inroads and devastations by the Scots. Norham, Alnwick and Wark were captured by David I of Scotland in the wars of Stephen's reign. In 1174, during his invasion of Northumbria, William I of Scotland, also known as William the Lion, was captured by a party of about four hundred mounted knights, led by Ranulf de Glanvill. This incident became known as the Battle of Alnwick. In 1295, Robert de Ros and the earls of Athol and Menteith ravaged Redesdale, Coquetdale and Tynedale. In 1314 the county was ravaged by king Robert Bruce. And so dire was the Scottish threat in 1382, that by special enactment the earl of Northumberland was ordered to remain on his estates to protect the border. In 1388, Henry Percy was taken prisoner and 1500 of his men slain at the battle of Otterburn, immortalised in the ballad of Chevy Chase. Alnwick, Bamburgh and Dunstanburgh were garrisoned for the Lancastrian cause in 1462, but after the Yorkist victories of Hexham and Hedgley Moor in 1464, Alnwick and Dunstanburgh surrendered, and Bamburgh was taken by storm. In September 1513, King James IV of Scotland was killed at the Battle of Flodden on Branxton Moor. Roman Catholic support in Northumberland for Mary, Queen of Scots, led to the Rising of the North in 1569. *Harbottle *Border Reivers *Peel tower Union and Civil War After uniting the English and Scottish thrones, James VI and I sharply curbed the lawlessness of the border reivers and brought relative peace to the region. There were Church of Scotland congregations in Northumberland in the 17th and 18th centuries. During the Civil War of the 17th century, Newcastle was garrisoned for the king by the earl of Newcastle, but in 1644 it was captured by the Scots under the earl of Leven, and in 1646 Charles I was led there a captive under the charge of David Leslie. Many of the chief Northumberland families were ruined in the Jacobite rebellion of 1715. Industrialisation The mineral resources of the area appear to have been exploited to some extent from remote times. It is certain that coal was used by the Romans in Northumberland, and some coal ornaments found at Angerton have been attributed to the 7th century. In a 13th-century grant to Newminster Abbey a road for the conveyance of sea coal from the shore about Blyth is mentioned, and the Blyth coal field was worked throughout the 14th and 15th centuries. The coal trade on the Tyne did not exist to any extent before the 13th century, but from that period it developed rapidly, and Newcastle acquired the monopoly of the river shipping and coal trade. Lead was exported from Newcastle in the 12th century, probably from Hexhamshire, the lead mines of which were very prosperous throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. In a charter from Richard I to Hugh de Puiset creating him earl of Northumberland, mines of silver and iron are mentioned. A salt pan is mentioned at Warkworth in the 12th century; in the 13th century the salt industry flourished at the mouth of the river Blyth, and in the 15th century formed the principal occupation of the inhabitants of North and South Shields. In the reign of Elizabeth I, glass factories were set up at Newcastle by foreign refugees, and the industry spread rapidly along the Tyne. Tanning, both of leather and of nets, was largely practised in the 13th century, and the salmon fisheries in the Tyne were famous in the reign of Henry I. *John Smeaton designed the Coldstream Bridge and a bridge at Hexham. *Stephenson's Rocket * Invention of the steam turbine by Charles Algernon Parsons See also * Northumbria * Northumbria's golden age * Earl of Northumberland * History of England * Kingdom of England * Timeline of Northumbria and Northumberland References * Stenton, F.

LIPA offers eleven full-time BA Honours degrees in a range of fields across the performing arts, as well as three Foundation Certificate programmes of study in acting, dance and popular music, and music technology. LIPA offers full-time, one-year masters-level degree courses in Acting (Company) and Costume Making. It is a member of the Federation of Drama Schools. The Education Guardian has previously ranked LIPA No. 1 in the UK for several of its degree courses, and it is regularly ranked as one of the top 10 specialist institutions. LIPA has been awarded gold by the Government's Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF), which rates higher education providers by teaching quality. In September 2003, LIPA launched LIPA 4‚Äì19; a part-time performing arts academy for 4 to 19-year olds. Since then, a satellite school and associate academies have also been launched. LIPA started its own primary free school in 2014 and its own sixth form free college in September 2016. History =Formation= LIPA was founded by Paul McCartney and Mark Featherstone-Witty. McCartney had known since 1985 that the building which had housed his old school ‚Äî the Liverpool Institute High School for Boys ‚Äì was becoming increasingly derelict after the school's closure, and wished to find a productive use for it; Featherstone- Witty had set up the Brit School in London and was looking for an opportunity to open another school. Featherstone-Witty had been inspired by Alan Parker's 1980 film Fame, to think about what the best possible training would have been for work in the arts and entertainment industry. The film led him to conclude that performing artists needed to train in all three performing arts (acting, dance and music) at the same time. He also took into account that performers form only a part of the arts and entertainment business. From these basic concepts, he created a blueprint for a new type of training and began consulting with others in the industry. By 1985 he had support from just under 50 artists, directors, choreographers and entrepreneurs. Record producer George Martin knew that Featherstone-Witty was looking for somewhere to develop a school, and that McCartney was looking for someone who could save the building, and introduced them to each other. The process of setting up the facility and the school took seven years and cost ¬£20m. =1996‚Äìtoday= LIPA was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 7 June 1996, and since then its range of courses has expanded each academic year. LIPA marked its 10th birthday in January 2006 with a performance at the Liverpool Philharmonic Hall and a new book, LIPA ‚Äì The First Ten Years in Pictures, written by Featherstone-Witty. A recent survey of graduates who left in 2014 showed that 91% were in work, and 83% of those were working in the performing arts. The curriculum is regularly changed in an attempt to maintain this situation. LIPA was designated as a higher education institution (HEI) in 2006. As a performing arts HEI, LIPA is attended by the highest number of international students in the UK. LIPA has been awarded the Gold Standard from Investors in People ‚Äì the only HEI to have achieved this level in the UK. LIPA also has the highest concentration of Fellows and Associates recognised by the Higher Education Academy. In March 2012, LIPA announced that it had purchased the former building of the Liverpool College of Art for ¬£3.7 million, to expand its teaching accommodation. Building work started on the Art School in 2014, and was completed in August 2016. Under the Free School programme, LIPA opened a primary school nearby in 2014, and a Sixth Form College in September 2016, both of which became oversubscribed. Admissions There were 5,225 applications to the institute through UCAS in 2010, of which 208 were accepted, giving the Institute an acceptance rate of 4%. Undergraduate tuition fees were ¬£9,250 GBP in 2019, and International tuition fees were ¬£16,200 GBP for 2019. Current courses LIPA qualifications are validated by Liverpool John Moores University. =Foundation Certificates= *Foundation Certificate in Acting *Foundation Certificate in Dance *Foundation Certificate in Popular Music and Sound Technology =Undergraduate (Degree)= *BA (Honours) Acting *BA (Honours) Acting (Screen & Digital Media) *BA (Honours) Applied theatre & Community Drama *BA (Honours) Creative Technologies & Performance (BA (Hons)/MArts programme) *BA (Honours) Dance *BA (Honours) Music *BA (Honours) Music (Song Writing & Performance) *BA (Honours) Music (Song Writing & Production) *BA (Honours) Management of Music, Entertainment, Theatre & Events *BA (Honours) Sound technology *BA (Honours) Theatre and Performance Design *BA (Honours) Theatre and Performance Technology =Masters (Degree)= *Master of Arts in Acting (Company) - In association with the Everyman and Playhouse theatres. *Master of Arts in Costume Making Companions LIPA does not issue its own degrees, so rather than issuing Honorary degrees like other British universities, it awards \\"Companionships\\" to individuals in recognition of their contributions to the world of art and entertainment, particularly within the sectors LIPA is associated with.

The parish had approximately 820 inhabitants according to the 2001 census. It contains the localities Arrifana, Canada da Tr√°s, Canada das Faias, Faj√£ de Jo√£o Dias, Quarteiro, and Rosais. The western corner of the island is essentially a plateau, with tall cliffs extending until the Ponta dos Rosais, where the Ponta dos Rosais Lighthouse stands as a beacon. The rest of the parish consists mostly of pastures, although it also contains the wooded area Parque Florestal das Sete Fontes (Forest Park of the Seven Springs). Sete Fontes contains green spaces and animal pens and hosts an annual festival honoring the Flemish emigrants who first settled S√£o Jorge and the Azores. Although many of the cliffs are sheer drops, there are volcanic debris fields along the coast that give rise to S√£o Jorge's faj√£s.

Set in a post-9/11 world, it is the first book to feature The Campus, a covert intelligence agency created by President Jack Ryan before the end of his term as chief executive. While he does not appear in the book, his son Jack Ryan Jr., as well as his nephews Dominic and Brian Caruso, are featured as The Campus operatives. The book debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list, and would become Clancy's last solely written novel before a seven-year break from writing fiction. Plot summary In Rome, a Mossad station chief is assassinated. The murder piques the interest of the Campus, an off-the-books intelligence agency created by former United States president Jack Ryan before the end of his presidential term. Situated in a high-rise office building that has direct line-of-sight between the main headquarters for the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency, the organization was created to \\"identify, locate, and deal with terrorist threats\\" in anticipation of the current administration's neglect of the CIA and the NSA. A private trading and arbitrage company, Hendley Associates, serves as a legitimate front for the Campus by funding its operations via stock market trades influenced by the captured intelligence data, thus removing federal oversight and allowing free rein in its operations. Jack Ryan Jr., son of the former president, soon discovers the Campus' operations. Wanting to serve his country in the post-9/11 world, he is hired by the agency as an analyst. Elsewhere, his cousin Brian Caruso is a U.S. Marine returning from Afghanistan to be decorated for his achievements in battle. His twin brother Dominic is an FBI agent who, while investigating a kidnapping of a little girl, finds her raped and killed. Caruso kills the suspect ostensibly in self defense after purposely getting noticed, and the suspect reacts by grabbing a knife at gun-point (thereby providing a \\"threat\\"). The Caruso brothers are soon recruited into a Campus strike team, chosen for their ability to kill enemies in cold blood. However, Brian is unsure of the morality of carrying out preemptive assassinations, even against terrorists. This changes when cells of Islamic fundamentalists cross the U.S.-Mexico border and attack several suburban malls. Brian and Dominic happen to be at one of the malls when the attack occurs. Although they efficiently find and dispatch all four shooters, dozens of people are killed; similar massacres occur at most of the other targeted sites. When a child dies in his arms after the attack, Brian abandons his earlier moral qualms. The Campus decides the brothers are ready and implements a \\"reconnaissance by fire\\" strategy to flush out the terrorist leaders. To carry out the assassinations, the brothers are issued a weapon utilizing succinylcholine, developed by a Columbia University professor whose brother died in the 9/11 attacks. The succinylcholine is delivered through a hypodermic needle disguised as a pen. Twisting the nib switches the tip from a normal tip to a sharp needle that delivers 7 milligrams of the substance. Only 5 milligrams are necessary for death. The substance causes complete paralysis at 30 to 50 seconds and death at 3 minutes, shutting down all the muscles within the victim (including the diaphragm), with the exception of the heart. However, it makes the murder look like a heart attack, thus raising no suspicion. Disguised as tourists, the team travels across Europe, finding and murdering several major players in the terrorist organization. The first three murders go off fairly routinely, and for the fourth assassination, the brothers are joined by their cousin Jack. Although originally present as an observer, Jack is forced to kill the target himself when a random accident spills wine on the brothers' suits, spoiling their anonymous appearance. After murdering the terrorist (coincidentally in the same men's room where the terrorist had killed the Mossad station chief), Jack uses his hotel key to gain access to his computer and downloads the entire contents for later analysis.

Charlottesville Fashion Square, a shopping mall in the Charlottesville area, serves as the setting of a massacre by a team of Islamic terrorists in the story. The scene includes accurate references to the mall's contemporary tenant stores, as well as to the University of Virginia. A spokesperson for Charlottesville Fashion Square told The Hook that the mall's operators were not pleased with the mall's inclusion in the book. Albemarle County Police chief John Miller indicated that he did not consider the novel a threat to the town.

His poems, written in Portuguese, address such issues as racism and the Portuguese colonial domination of Mozambique. A supporter of the anti- Portuguese group FRELIMO during the colonial wars, he was imprisoned in the 1960s. He was one of the African pioneers of the N√©gritude movement, and published six books of poetry between 1964 and 1997. Craveirinha also wrote under the pseudonyms M√°rio Vieira, Jos√© Cravo, Jesu√≠no Cravo, J. Cravo, J.C., Ab√≠lio Cossa, and Jos√© G. Vetrinha. Biography Born in Maputo, Mozambique (then Louren√ßo Marques, Portuguese Mozambique), the child of a Portuguese father and a black mother of the Ronga ethnicity, Craveirinha was raised in the language and culture of Portugal. As a journalist, he contributed to numerous Mozambican magazines and newspapers, including O Brado Africano (1918‚Äì74), Not√≠cias, Tribuna, Not√≠cias da Tarde, Voz de Mo√ßambique, Not√≠cias da Beira, Di√°rio de Mo√ßambique, and Voz Africana. He became familiar with other poets of the period through his journalism, notably Rui de Noronha (1909‚Äì1943), Marcelino dos Santos (1929‚Äì ), and Noemia de Sousa (1926‚Äì2003). His works were primarily political in nature. Consistent themes in his work were African self-determination, images of the African landscape, and writing that reflected the influence of African languages. Craveirinha began his political activity at the Louren√ßo Marques African Association in the 1950s, an organization tolerated by the colonial Portuguese government, and later became its chairperson. He became involved in clandestine politics in this period, and became a member of a cell of FRELIMO, the leading movement for the liberation of Mozambique from Portuguese rule. He was imprisoned in solitary confinement by the fascist Portuguese PIDE r√©gime in 1965, a year after his publication of his first collection of poetry, Chigubo. He was released from prison in 1969. When FRELIMO seized power in 1974, was appointed vice-director of the national press. He was the first president of Association of Mozambican Writers (Associa√ß√£o dos Escritores Mo√ßambicanos), and served from 1982 and 1987. The association established the Jos√© Craveirinha Prize for Literature (Pr√©mio Jos√© Craveirinha de Literatura) in 2003. Craveirinha was awarded the Pr√©mio Cam√µes, the world's highest honour for Lusophone literature, in 1991. He is noted as the first African writer to win the prize. He was considered several times for the Nobel Prize for Literature. In 2003, Craveirinha was declared a \\"national hero\\" by President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, who praised Craveirinha's literary contribution to the fight against colonialism. Despite his literary acclaim, Craveirinha was hesitant to have his works appear in print, and a large body of his work from the pre- and post-colonial periods remains unpublished. His wife Maria died in October 1977. Craveirinha wrote numerous poems after her death that were first published under the title Maria in 1988, and in a much fuller form in a second edition in 1998. Craveirinha also played football and coached other athletes. He arranged an athletic scholarship in the United States for Maria de Lurdes Mutola, who won a gold medal in track and field at the Olympics in 2000, and his son Stelio also held the national long jump record. Craveirinha died at the age of 80 while undergoing treatment in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2003.

The plot is about a love triangle between a doctor, who specializes in sleep and aging research, and a vampire couple. The film is a loose adaptation of the 1981 novel of the same name by Whitley Strieber, with a screenplay by Ivan Davis and Michael Thomas. The groundbreaking special effects were handled by Dick Smith (make-up artist) (of The Exorcist fame).https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/movie-makeup-master- dick-smith-1922-2014/36/ After premiering at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival, The Hunger was released in the spring of 1983 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Though it received a mixed critical response, the film accrued a cult following within the goth subculture in the years since its release.  Plot  Miriam Blaylock is a vampire, seen in flashbacks drinking from victims in Ancient Egypt, promising specially chosen humans eternal life as her vampire lovers. Her current companion is John, a talented cellist whom she recruited in 18th century France. In a night club in New York, they connect with a young couple who they bring home and feed upon by slashing their throats with a bladed Ankh pendant. The bodies are disposed of by an incinerator in the basement of John and Miriam's elegant New York townhouse, where they pose as a wealthy couple who teach classical music. Now 200 years after his turning, John begins suffering insomnia and ages years in only a few days. John realizes Miriam's promise that periodically killing and feeding upon human victims would give him immortality was only partially true: he will have eternal life but not eternal youth. He seeks out Dr. Sarah Roberts, a gerontologist who works with scientists Tom (her boyfriend) and Charlie, specializing in the effects of rapid aging in primates, hoping she will be able to reverse his accelerating decrepitude. Sarah assumes that John is a hypochondriac or mentally unbalanced and ignores his pleas for help. As John leaves the clinic in a rage, Sarah is horrified to see how rapidly he is aging. John rebuffs her once she tries to help him. One of the Blaylocks' students, Alice Cavender, drops by their townhouse to say that she cannot attend the next day's lesson. In a last attempt to regain his youth, John murders and feeds upon Alice, whom Miriam was grooming to be her next consort when she came of age, to no avail. John begs Miriam to kill him and release him from the agony of his decrepit body. Weeping, Miriam tells him there is no release. After John collapses in the basement, Miriam carries him into the attic full of coffins and places him in one. Like John, Miriam's former vampire lovers suffer an eternal living death, helplessly moaning and trapped in their coffins. Later, a police official comes to the residence, looking for the missing Alice. Miriam feigns ignorance and claims that her husband is in Switzerland. Sarah comes looking for John at his home but only finds Miriam, who now feels alone after losing both John and Alice. The two have a sexual encounter, during which Miriam bites her arm and some of Miriam's blood enters Sarah's body. Miriam attempts to initiate Sarah in the necessities of life as a vampire, but Sarah is repulsed by the thought of subsisting on human blood. Sarah returns home and goes out to dinner with Tom, who becomes argumentative about her 3-hour disappearance at the Blaylock residence, of which she is strangely quiet. The next day at the lab, the team investigates Sarah's blood by Tom's authority and reveal she has some kind of infection that is taking over. Confused, Sarah returns to confront Miriam about her sudden changes. Still reeling from the effects of her vampiric transformation, Sarah allows Miriam to put her to bed in a guest room. Tom arrives on Miriam's doorstep, trying to find Sarah. Miriam shows him to the upstairs bedroom. Sarah, starving and desperate, kills Tom. Miriam assures her that she will soon forget what she was. As the two kiss, Sarah drives Miriam's ankh-knife into her own throat and holds her mouth over Miriam's, forcing Miriam to ingest her blood. Miriam carries Sarah upstairs, intending to place her with her other boxed lovers. A rumbling occurs and the mummies of Miriam's previous lovers, including John, emerge from their coffins, driving her over the edge of the balcony. As she rapidly ages, the mummies become dust. The police investigator returns to find a real estate agent showing the townhouse to prospective buyers. Sarah is now in London, standing on the balcony of a chic apartment tower, admiring the view as dusk falls. From a draped coffin in a storage room, Miriam repeatedly screams Sarah's name.  Cast  * Catherine Deneuve as Miriam Blaylock * David Bowie as John Blaylock * Susan Sarandon as Sarah Roberts * Cliff De Young as Tom Haver * Dan Hedaya as Lieutenant Allegrezza * Beth Ehlers as Alice Cavender * Rufus Collins as Charlie Humphries In addition, Willem Dafoe and John Pankow have brief appearances as two youths harassing Sarah at a phone booth, John Stephen Hill and Ann Magnuson play a wild young couple whom Miriam and John pick up at a nightclub to consume at the start of the film, and James Aubrey plays a man whom Miriam brings to Sarah as her potential first victim. English gothic rock band Bauhaus appear during the film's opening credits as a group performing at the nightclub, where they play their single \\"Bela Lugosi's Dead.\\" Silent film star Bessie Love makes her final film appearance as an aging fan at Sarah's book signing.  Production  The final scene of Sarah on the balcony was added at the studio's behest, with a view to leaving the film open-ended and allowing for possible sequels.Tony Scott, DVD audio commentary, 2004, Warner Bros. Sarandon later expressed regret that this sequence seemed to make no sense in the context of the rest of the film: \\"The thing that made the film interesting to me was this question of, 'Would you want to live forever if you were an addict?' But as the film progressed, the powers that be rewrote the ending and decided that I wouldn't die, so what was the point? All the rules that we'd spent the entire film delineating, that Miriam lived forever and was indestructible, and all the people that she transformed [eventually] died, and that I killed myself rather than be an addict [were ignored]. Suddenly I was kind of living, she was kind of half dying... Nobody knew what was going on, and I thought that was a shame.\\"Susan Sarandon, DVD audio commentary, 2004, Warner Bros. Bowie was excited to work on the film but was concerned about the final product. He said \\"I must say, there's nothing that looks like it on the market. But I'm a bit worried that it's just perversely bloody at some points.\\"  Music  Howard Blake was musical director on The Hunger. Although a soundtrack album accompanied the film's release (Var√®se Sarabande VSD 47261), this issue omits much of the music used in the film. Blake's notes on working with director Tony Scott: \\"Tony wanted to create a score largely using classical music and I researched this, many days going to his home in Wimbledon with stacks of recordings to play to him. One of these was the duet for 2 sopranos from Delibes' Lakm√©, which I recorded specially with Elaine Barry and Judith Rees, conducting my orchestra The Sinfonia of London. Howard Shelley joined with Ralph Holmes and Raphael Wallfisch to record the second movement of Schubert's Piano Trio in E flat. Ralph recorded the Gigue from Bach's Violin Partita in E and Raphael the Prelude to Bach's solo cello sonata in G, to which Bowie mimed. I was persuaded to appear in one scene as a pianist, for which I wrote a 'Dolphin Square Blues'. Tony wanted to add a synthesizer score and I introduced him to Hans Zimmer, then working at The Snake Ranch Studio in Fulham but Tony eventually used a score by Michel Rubini and Denny Jaeger with electronics by David Lawson. It is hard however to exactly separate these elements.\\"  Release  = Critical response = The Hunger received mixed reviews upon its release, with criticism given towards its pacing and plot, while being heavy on atmosphere and visuals. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times described the film as \\"an agonizingly bad vampire movie,\\" remarking that the sex scene between Deneuve and Sarandon is effective, but that the film is so heavy on set design and scene cuts that any sense of a story is lost. In a brief review in Rolling Stone, Michael Sragow similarly called it \\"A minor horror movie with a major modern-movie problem: director Tony Scott develops so many ingenious ways to illustrate his premise that there's no time left to tell a story.\\" Christopher John reviewed The Hunger in Ares Magazine #15 and commented that \\"Beautifully filmed, but boringly void of substance, The Hunger is (was) a film to be avoided like the plague.\\" The critic Camille Paglia wrote in Sexual Personae (1990) that while The Hunger comes close to being a masterpiece of a \\"classy genre of vampire film\\", it is \\"ruined by horrendous errors, as when the regal Catherine Deneuve is made to crawl around on all fours, slavering over cut throats\\", which Paglia considered an inappropriate focus on violence rather than sex. The critic Elaine Showalter called The Hunger a \\"post-modernist vampire film\\" that \\"casts vampirism in bisexual terms, drawing on the tradition of the lesbian vampire...Contemporary and stylish, [it] is also disquieting in its suggestion that men and women in the 1980s have the same desires, the same appetites, and the same needs for power, money, and sex.\\" On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, The Hunger holds a 52% approval rating based on 31 reviews, with an average rating of 5.61/10. The consensus reads: \\"Stylish yet hollow, The Hunger is a well-cast vampire thriller that mistakes erotic moments for a satisfying story.\\" The Hunger was nominated two Saturn Awards for Best Costume and Best Make-up. David Bowie later commented about the film that \\"the first twenty minutes rattle along like hell - it really is a great opening.\\"The quote continues; \\"It loses its way about there, but it's still an interesting movie.\\" David Bowie: The Last Interview: and Other Conversations, By David Bowie = Later emergence as a cult film = The film has been listed as a cult film.p177 The Cult Film Experience: Beyond All Reason edited by J. P. Telotte Later reviews have called the film \\"outrageously sleek\\" and \\"a cinematic work of art that has stood the test of time\\" that deserves \\"a new look.\\"  Legacy  The film has found a cult following that responded to its dark, glamorous atmosphere. The Bauhaus song \\"Bela Lugosi's Dead\\" plays over the opening scene and credits. The film is popular with some segments of the Goth subculture and inspired a short-lived TV series of the same name, although the series has no direct plot or character connection to it. The film has been cited by publisher Fred Burger as an influence on the creation and direction of his gothic subculture zine Propaganda, and by showrunner Bryan Fuller on his television series Hannibal.

The population is 61,702 (2015 est.) in an area of . It is located in the metropolitan area of Salvador. Santo Amaro is located approximately from the city of Salvador. Santo Amaro was home to numerous Amerindian peoples until the arrival of the Portuguese, who developed the region for sugarcane production. Santo Amaro is now noted for its numerous historic structures. The city is also a center of Candombl√©, having more than 60 terreiros, or temples of the religion.Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat√≠stica History Santo Amaro was home to Caet√©, Pitiguaras, and Carij√≥s peoples prior to the Portuguese colonization of Brazil. The region became an early center of sugarcane production under the Portuguese, with settlements primarily along the Suba√© River. It, along with Cachoeira and Nazare, became early regional urban and economic centers of the Rec√¥ncavo region. Santo Amaro was part of the municipality of S√£o Francisco do Conde until 1727. The city has numerous historic structures as a result of its colonial past, most notably the Parish Church of Our Lady of Purification (Igreja Matriz Santo Amaro da Purifica√ß√£o). Other historic structures include the remains of the mansions of former sugar barons and a municipal palace built in 1769. The area is noted for its nearby beautiful beaches, the Falls of Vit√≥ria, and the grotto of Bom Jesus dos Pobres. The town features prominently in the novel The War of the Saints by Jorge Amado. =Epidemic of 1855= A cholera epidemic occurred in 1855, killing approximately 50,000 in Santo Amaro and in Salvador, Bahia. Half of the population of Santo Amaro was lost. Doctor Cypriano Barbosa Bett√¢mio died leading efforts to combat the disease. Geography Santo Amaro covers and borders the municipalities of Concei√ß√£o do Jacu√≠pe, Am√©lia Rodrigues, Feira de Santana, S√£o Sebasti√£o do Pass√©, S√£o Francisco do Conde, Saubara, Cachoeira, and S√£o Gon√ßalo dos Campos. =Suba√© River= The Suba√© River runs through much of the municipality to the Bay of All Saints. Scientists discovered large-scale lead, cadmium, and zinc pollution in the river in 1975, caused by industrial output from a factory owned by the Brazilian Lead Company (Cobrac). The factory operated from 1960 to 1993, but high levels of lead exposure remain among many segments of the population of the municipality. Religion According to the Brazilian Census of 2010, Santo Amaro is 77% Roman Catholic, 22% Evangelical, and 1% Spiritist. The statistics do not take into account Candombl√© practitioners. Santo Amaro has both a large number of Candombl√© terreiros (60) and a long tradition of religious syncretism between Candombl√© and Roman Catholicism. Historic structures Santo Amaro is home to numerous colonial-period historic structures, many designated as Brazilian national and Bahian state monuments. *Church of Our Lady of Protection (Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Amparo) *Parish Church of Our Lady of Purification (Igreja Matriz de Nossa Senhora da Purifica√ß√£o) *Retreat and Church of Our Lady of Humility (Recolhimento e Igreja de Nossa Senhora dos Humildes) *Town Hall and Prison (Casa de C√¢mara e Cadeia) *Santa Casa de Miseric√≥rdia of Santo Amaro *Igreja de Nossa Senhora de Oliveira dos Campinhos *Solar do Conde de Suba√© *Solar Para√≠so *Sobrado at Rua da Matriz, 9 (Sobrado √† Rua da Purifica√ß√£o, n¬∫ 9) *Bemb√© do Mercado Noted residents *Maria Beth√¢nia (1946-), singer and songwriter, was born in Santo Amaro and moved to Salvador at the age of nine.

He has numerous athletic accomplishments, and works as a motivational speaker. Early life Rummerfield was born in Vallejo, California in 1953. At an early age, Rummerfield was separated from his siblings and raised in an Idaho orphanage. He was adopted at age seven. Shortly afterwards, Rummerfield's adoptive father enrolled him at YMCA, where he participated in athletics. Injury and rehabilitation On September 20, 1974, at age 21, Rummerfield and a friend were in a near fatal car accident while traveling at (). He has admitted he had been drinking before the accident. He was paralyzed and given less than 72 hours to live. While surviving despite his doctor's expectations, he had fractured all his ribs, broken his neck in four places, shattered his collar bone, suffered massive head injuries, and had one of his eyes placed back into its socket. As he was unable to move from the neck down, his chances of long-term survival were not good, and doctors recommended he be sent to a convalescent home. He decided not to follow the doctors' orders, and chose intensive rehabilitation. While learning to operate a wheelchair with his mouth he experienced his first rehabilitative breakthrough. He recalls, \\"I was lying in bed one night, thinking how much I loved to play basketball and dreamed of driving a race car one day when my big toe moved.\\" He spent the next three years learning to walk and to use his hands again. Over the next fourteen years, he struggled with balance and coordination problems caused by the accident. He eventually regained the ability to jog and ride a bicycle without falling down. He went through six knee surgeries and total reconstruction of his right ankle and right wrist. To this day, nerve damage to the right side of his body has left him with an off-kilter gait. Doctors have partially credited his recovery to his commitment to a then daily regimen of intensive physical therapy, including weightlifting, jumprope and stationary bicycle. However, this level of recovery from quadriplegia was at that time unknown. After seventeen years of intensive rehabilitation, he is now capable of essentially normal walking, despite having over 85% of his spinal cord destroyed at C-4. Rummerfield is sometimes described as \\"the world's only fully recovered quadriplegic\\". While his physical mobility is essentially normal, Rummerfield still experiences loss of sensation in his lower legs, impaired bowel and bladder function, reduced strength in his hands, and difficulty regulating body temperature. Achievements In 1991 he began to compete in triathlons. In 1992, he participated in the IronMan Triathlon in Hawaii ‚Äì a swim, bicycle ride and marathon. He became the first SCI quadriplegic to participate in and complete the Hawaii IronMan. In 1997, he ran the Antarctica Marathon ‚Äì one of only 82 people to complete the course which crosses glaciers, icy streams, rock beds and soggy beaches in sub-zero temperatures and 45 mph winds. Pat became the first SCI quadriplegic to participate and complete a marathon. Rummerfield is the holder of the FIA World Land Speed Record for a Class III electric vehicle (over 1000 kg), at , in White Lightning, set October 22, 1999. He is the recipient of the 2000 ESPN's Ar√©te Amateur Athlete of The Year Award, the United States Marines Corps \\"Lead By Example Medallion\\" and the distinguished Human Spirit Award at the 2000 Christopher Reeve/Gateway To A Cure Awards Ceremonies. He has thrown out the first pitch at a Chicago Cubs baseball game. He completed the Los Angeles Marathon. He was chosen by the Coca-Cola Company to be part of the 2004 Summer Olympics torch relay, and was the national spokesman for all of the runners in the relay. He began attending racing schools, including the Bob Bondurant School of High Performance Driving, and in October 2009 he accomplished another first by becoming the first SCI quadriplegic to participate in a professional motorsport, racing a dragster during the 2009 ADRL World Finals. He was the first physically challenged athlete to participate and finish a stage in an adventure race, a particularly challenging athletic event. Motivational work and public appearances Rummerfield has said about his initial injury from drunk driving, \\"I made a huge mistake and take full responsibility for my irresponsible actions.\\" His athletic endeavors raise money for a number of charities. He is co-founder of the NextSteps Foundation and of \\"Adventures on Wheels\\". As a lecturer, Rummerfield travels nationwide to share his story and to encourage others to set goals and to \\"Never Give Up\\". Rummerfield has said, \\"Whenever I meet someone in a wheelchair, I make a point of letting them know that there truly is nothing special about me. I am no more deserving of a miracle than anyone else.\\" He has appeared on Ty Pennington's Extreme Makeover: Home Edition in support of a fellow paraplegic's recovery efforts at the Kennedy Krieger Institute. Rummerfield was on the team at Washington University in St. Louis credited with helping Christopher Reeve regain function. He has been featured on the Discovery Channel and Ripley's Believe It or Not, among other media.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=K8sNAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=fXQDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6803,3659591&dq;=patrick+rummerfield&hl;=en References External links *Patrick Rummerfield official website (under construction) *Patrick Rummerfield official website (older version) Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:People with tetraplegia Category:Land speed record people Category:Bonneville 200 MPH Club members ","title":"Pat Rummerfield"},{"id":"1139776","text":"Urzelina is a civil parish in the municipality of Velas in the Portuguese islands of the Azores.

It is alternately known as S√£o Mateus, to which the parish was named after its patron saint. History Urzelina as seen in 1910, during the popular festivals of the time The first settlers reached this coast in the 15th century, but were isolated from Faial. Many of the early homes were built along the coast, on lowlands and flanks of the interior mountain range, interspersed in the forests. The parish received its name owing to the abundance of urzela (Roccella tinctoria) found by the first explorers and settlers, along its coastal clifftops and which later became a source of an export market, because it was used in dying. Urzela, a species of fungus, was harvested and exported to Flanders and England in the early 15th-16th centuries, thereby supporting the economies of the island, in addition to many of the islands of the Azores. Urzelina was once a place within the parish of Manadas and elevated to parish around 1647. At the time, a decision was made to construct a port, in order to support and enhance its transitory exchange between the island and continental Portugal. It was important for the epoch, since it was one of the first ports constructed on the island at the time. The history of Urzelina has been shaped by the events of 1 May 1808, when a volcanic eruption destroyed a great part of the settlement, and caused fear and panic in its populous.Guida das Velas (2009-2010), p.10/11 It also resulted in the destruction of most of the arable lands, and plunged the island into a period of famine.

The pedals on the bicycle seem to stick to the rider's feet as the bike becomes airborne, much like how a skateboard seems to stick to the feet of the skater performing an Ollie. While the bunny hop can be quite challenging to learn, once mastered it opens up a whole new level of riding opportunities for both BMX and mountain bike rider alike. The bunny hop is also a useful skill for an urban cyclist/commuter, allowing the avoidance of potholes and other hazards, and allowing for quick mounting of curbs. More often, bunny hops are done on BMX bikes, which are smaller than mountain bikes and, because they are more lightweight, lend themselves to be lifted far more easily. There are two methods of performing a bunnyhop. The first, known simply as a bunnyhop, involves both wheels being lifted at once, and is typically easier to do when the rider is using clipless bicycle pedals. The second is known as a pro hop, involves the rider lifting the front wheel of the bike before the back wheel, and requires precise balance and body movements. If not done properly, a pro hop will very easily lead to a crash or forced dismounting due to the physics involved. Technique The bunny hop is executed by approaching an obstacle with a medium rolling speed, arms and legs slightly bent. Upon reaching the obstacle, the rider first needs to shift their center of gravity towards the rear wheel of the bike and pull back on the handlebars, causing the front wheel to lift as if doing a manual. As the front wheel reaches maximum height, they 'scoop' up the rear of the bike by pointing their toes downwards and applying backwards and upwards force to the pedals, while pushing down and forward on the handlebars. It helps to think about the lifting of the back tire as snapping one's wrist forward and shifting their weight at the same time. The combination of these two motions allows the rider to first raise their centre of gravity, and then tuck the bike underneath them, to achieve greater ground clearance. The second technique, more easily performed on a bicycle with full suspension, is applying a weighting compression force downwards into bars and pedals, once full compression is achieved then springing upwards un-weighting both bars and pedals equal amounts so that both front and rear wheels leave the ground. This technique can also be combined with a lifting of the bike through clip less pedals and is sometimes termed the English bunny hop.

Historically the area has always had some importance, containing valuable agricultural land in the centre of the country and the prestigious university in the county town of Oxford (whose name came from Anglo-Saxon Oxenaford = \\"ford for oxen\\"). Ignored by the Romans, it was not until the formation of a settlement at Oxford in the 8th century that the area grew in importance. Alfred the Great was born across the Thames in Wantage in Berkshire. The University of Oxford was founded in 1096, though its collegiate structure did not develop until later on. The area was part of the Cotswolds wool trade from the 13th century, generating much wealth, particularly in the western portions of the county in the Oxfordshire Cotswolds. Morris Motors was founded in Oxford in 1912, bringing heavy industry to an otherwise agricultural county. The importance of agriculture as an employer has declined rapidly in the 20th century though; currently under one percent of the county's population are involved due to high mechanisation. There are fourteen hundreds in Oxfordshire, among them being five of the Chiltern hundreds. The jurisdiction over these five belonged to the manor of Benson, and in 1199 to Robert de Harecourt, a name which is still to be found in the county in the Harcourts of Stanton-Harcourt and Nuneham. The county includes small portions of Berkshire and Buckinghamshire, which lie in the hundreds of Bampton and Ploughley respectively. Throughout most of its history the county was divided into fourteen hundreds, namely Bampton, Banbury, Binfield, Bloxham, Bullingdon, Chadlington, Dorchester, Ewelme, Langtree, Lewknor, Pyrton, Ploughley, Thame and Wootton. There has been little change in the county boundary; but acts of William IV and Victoria slightly increased its area. Anglo-Saxon England The origin of the county of Oxford is somewhat uncertain; like other divisions of the Mercian kingdom, the older boundaries were entirely wiped out, and the district was renamed after the principal town. The boundaries, except for the southern one, which is formed by the Thames, are artificial. The district was overrun in the 6th century by the victorious West Saxons, who took Benson and Eynsham, as may be seen in the Saxon Chronicle for 571. In the 7th century the Mercians held all the northern border of the Thames, and during the 8th century this district twice changed hands, falling to Wessex after the battle of Burford, and to Mercia after a battle at Benson. As part of the Mercian kingdom it was included in the diocese of Lincoln. A bishopric had been established at Dorchester as early as 634, when Birinus, the apostle of Wessex, was given an episcopal seat there, but when a bishop was established at Winchester this bishopric seems to have come to an end. Before the Mercian conquest in 777, Oxfordshire was in the diocese of Sherborne. In 873 the jurisdiction of Dorchester reached to the Humber, and when the Danes were converted it extended over Leicestershire and Lincolnshire, Oxfordshire forming about an eighth of the diocese. The Danes overran the county during the 10th century; Thurkell's army burnt Oxford in 1010, and the combined armies of Sweyn and Olaf crossed Watling Street and ravaged the district, Oxford and Winchester submitting to them. In 1018 Danes and Englishmen chose Eadgar's law at an assembly in Oxford, and in 1036, on Canute's death, his son Harold Harefoot was chosen king. Here also took place the stormy meeting following the assembly (gemot) at Northampton, in which Harold Godwinson allowed his brother Tostig to be outlawed and Morkere to be chosen earl in his place, thus preparing the way for his own downfall and for the Norman Conquest. Norman Conquest The destruction of houses in Oxford recorded in the Domesday Book may possibly be accounted for by the ravages of the rebel army of Eadwine and Morkcre on this occasion, there being no undisputed mention of a siege by William. Large possessionsin the county fell to the Conqueror, and also to his rapacious kinsman, Odo, Bishop of Winchester. At the Norman Conquest Oxfordshire remained in the diocese of Sherborne, but in 1092 the seat of the diocese was transferred to Lincoln. The bishop of Lincoln also had extensive lands therein, while the abbeys of Abingdon, Osney and Godstow, with other religious houses, held much land in the county. Among lay tenants in chief, Robert D'Oili, heir of Wigod of Walhngford, held many manors and houses in Oxford, of which town he was governor. By the time of the conquest the importance of Oxford was already well established; the shire moot there is mentioned in Canute's Oxford laws, and it was undoubtedly the seat of the county court from the first, the castle being the county gaol. The principal historical events between this period and the Civil War belong less to the history of the county than to that of the city of Oxford. 13th to 16th centuries The county was represented in parliament in 1289 by two members. The pestilence of 1349, the conversion of arable into pasture land. Its prosperity steadily declined since the early 14th century, when it had been second in prosperity in the kingdom, owing its wealth largely to its well-watered pastures, which bred sheep whose wool was famous all over England, and to its good supply of water power. Salt is mentioned as a product of the county in Domesday Book. Various small industries grew up, such as plush-making at Banbury, leather works at Bampton and Burford, gloves at Woodstock, and malt at Henley. Glass was made at Benson and Stokenchurch in the reign of Henry VI, and the wool trade continued, though not in so flourishing a state, Witney retaining its fame in blanket making. The dissolution of the monasteries, though it affected the county greatly, caused no general disturbance, but the enclosure of common land in the early 16th century had led to agricultural depression and discontent. In 1542 a bishopric of Osney and Thame was established, taking its title from Oxford, the last abbot of Osney being appointed to it. In 1546 the existing bishopric of Oxford was established. The ecclesiastical boundaries remain as they were when archdeacons were first appointed ‚Äî the county and archdeaconry being conterminous ‚Äî and the county being almost entirely in the diocese of Oxford. 17th century =English Civil War= When King Charles I won the Battle of Edgehill (23 October 1642)‚Äîthe first battle of the English Civil War‚ÄîOxford at once became the material and moral stronghold of the royalist cause. Every manor house in the district became an advanced work, and from Banbury in the north to Marlborough in the west and Reading in the south the walled towns formed an outer line of defence. For the campaign of 1643 the role of this strong position was to be the detention of the main parliamentary army until the royalists from the north and the west could come into line on either hand, after which the united royal forces were to close upon London on all sides, and in the operations of that year Oxfordshire successfully performed its allotted functions. No serious breach was made in the line of defence, and more than once, notably at the Battle of Chalgrove Field (18 June 1643), Prince Rupert's cavalry struck hard and successfully. In the campaign of Newbury which followed, the parliamentary troops under Essex passed through north Oxfordshire on their way to the relief of Gloucester, and many confused skirmishes took place between them and Rupert's men; and when the campaign closed with the virtual defeat of the Royalists, the fortresses of the county offered them a refuge which Essex was powerless to disturb. The following campaign witnessed a change in Charles' strategy. Realizing his numerical weakness he abandoned the idea of an envelopment, and decided to use Oxfordshire as the stronghold from which he could strike in all directions. The commanding situation of the city itself prevented any serious attempt at investment by dividing the enemy's forces, but material wants made it impossible for Charles to maintain permanently his central position. Plans were continually resolved upon and cancelled on both sides, and eventually Essex headed for the south-west, leaving Waller to face the king alone. The Battle of Cropredy Bridge followed (29 June 1644), and the victorious king turned south to pursue and capture Essex at Lostwithiel in Cornwall. In the remaining operations of 1644 Oxfordshire again served as a refuge and as a base (Newbury and Donnington). With the appearance on the scene of Oliver Cromwell and the New Model Army a fresh interest arose. Having started from Windsor on the 20 April 1645, the future Protector carried out a daring cavalry raid. He caught and scattered the royalists unawares at Islip; then he pursued the fugitives to Bletchington and terrified the governor into surrendering. He swept right round Oxford, fought again at Bampton, and finally rejoined his chief, Fairfax, in Berkshire. A few days later Charles again marched away northwards, while Fairfax was ordered to besiege Oxford. In spite of the difficulties of the besiegers Charles was compelled to turn back to relieve the city, and the consequent delay led to the campaign and disaster of Naseby (14 June 1645). Yet even after Naseby the actual position of Oxfordshire was practically unshaken. It is true that Abingdon with its parliamentary garrison was a standing menace, but the districts east of the Cherwell and Thames, and the triangle bounded by Oxford, Faringdon and Banbury, still retained its importance, until early in 1646 the enemy closed from all sides on the last stronghold of royalism. The Battle of Stow-on-the- Wold witnessed the final battle of the First English Civil War. On the 9 May Banbury surrendered, and two days later Oxford itself was closely invested. On the 24 June 16e46 the city capitulated, and three days later Walhngford, the last place to give in, followed its example. The war left the county in an exceedingly impoverished condition. 18th and 19th centuries In 1830 the enclosure of Otmoor led to serious riots, in which the people gathered in Oxford at St Giles' fair joined. 20th and 21st centuries The Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry, the main army unit in the area, was based at Cowley Barracks on Bullingdon Green, Cowley. The Vale of the White Horse district and parts of the South Oxfordshire administrative district south of the River Thames were historically part of Berkshire, but were added to the administrative county of Oxfordshire in 1974. Conversely, the Caversham area of Reading now belongs to Berkshire but was historically part of Oxfordshire as was the parish of Stokenchurch, now in administrative Buckinghamshire. 2007 marked the county's 1000th birthday. Two canoes imported from Sylhet in Bangladesh were brought to Oxfordshire to host the United Kingdom's first Nowka Bais competition. The sport became an annual cultural event of Oxfordshire, attracting thousands such as the likes of the High Commissioner of Bangladesh. Antiquities =Castles= The remains of castles are scanty. The majority of them were probably built for defence in the Anarchy of Stephen's reign (1100‚Äì1135), and were not maintained after order was restored. Considerable portions of the Norman Oxford Castle survive, however, while there are slighter remains of the castle at Bampton, the seat of Aylmer de Valence in 1313. =Mansions= Among remains of former mansions there may be noted the 14th century Greys Court near Henley-on-Thames, Minster Lovell, on the Windrush above Witney, and Rycote, between Thame and Oxford. Minster Lovell, the extensive ruins of which make an exquisite picture by the river- side, was the seat of Francis, Lord Lovel, who, being the son of a Lancastrian father, incurred the hatred of that party by serving Richard III, and afterwards assisted the cause of Lambert Simnel, mysteriously disappearing after the Battle of Stoke. The remains of Rycote (partly incorporated with a farmhouse) are of fine Elizabethan brick, and in the chapel attached to the manor there is remarkable Jacobean woodwork, the entire fittings of the church, including the canopied pews and altar-table, being of this period. Here Princes [Elizabeth was kept in 1554, before her accession, and afterwards resided as Queen. Of ancient mansions still inhabited at the start of the 20th century, the finest is Broughton Castle near Banbury, dating from 1301. Others are Shirburn Castle, begun in 1377, but mainly Perpendicular of the next century; Stanton Harcourt, dating from 1450, with a gatehouse of 1540, a vast kitchen, and Pope's Tower, named from the poet, who stayed here more than once. Mapledurham, on the Thames above Reading, is a fine Tudor mansion of brick; and Water Eaton, on the Cherwell above Oxford, is a singularly perfect Jacobean house of stone, with a chapel of the same period resembling pure Perpendicular. Other mansions in the county include Blenheim Palace, near Woodstock; the former Holton House (now replaced by a Georgian building), near Wheatley, was the scene in 1646 of the wedding of the Parliamentary Major General Henry Ireton, Bridget daughter of Oliver Cromwell. =Ecclesiastical= The influence of such a centre of learning as the university was naturally very great upon the ecclesiastical history of Oxfordshire. A large number of monastic foundations arose, such as those of Augustinian canons at Bicester, Caversham, Cold Norton, Dorchester, Osney (a magnificent foundation just outside the walls of Oxford) and Wroxton; of Cistercians, at Bruern and Thame; of Benedictines, at Cogges, Eynsham, Milton; of Mathurins, at NuflSeld; of Gilbertines, at Clattercote; of Templars, at Sandford-on-Thames. There was at Gosford one of the only two preceptories of female Templars in England. Of all these, excepting the abbey church at Dorchester, remains are scanty. A few domestic buildings remain at Studley; the boundary walls still stand of Godstow Nunnery on the Thames, the retreat and burial-place of Rosamund Clifford or \\"Fair Rosamund,\\" the object of Henry II's famous courtship; and there are traces of Rewley Abbey within Oxford. In ecclesiastical architecture Oxfordshire, apart from Oxford itself, is remarkably rich, but there is no dominant style, nearly all the churches being of mixed dates. In fact, of the most important churches only Iffley, Adderbury and Minster Lovell need be taken as types of a single style. Iffley, picturesquely placed above the Thames south of Oxford, is one of the finest examples of pure Norman in England, with a highly ornate west front. Adderbury, south of Banbury, is a great cruciform Decorated church with a massive central tower and spire. Minster Lovell, also cruciform, is pure Perpendicular; its central tower is supported, with beautiful and unusual effect, on four detached piers.{sfnChisholm1911p=418}} One feature common to several churches in the county are spires. The short ungainly spire of Oxford cathedral was among the earliest, if not the first, constructed in England, and served as a model from which were probably developed the splendid central spires of the great churches at Witney, Bampton, Shipton-under- Wychwood and Bradwell. There are also three fine spires in the north: Bloxham, Adderbury and King's Sutton (across the border in Northamptonshire), which are locally proverbial as typifying length, strength and beauty. Bloxham church, mainly decorated with Norman portions and a remarkable Early English west front, is one of the largest and most beautiful in the county. In the west Burford (Norman and later) is noteworthy, and in the porch of the fine Norman church of Langford is seen the rare feature of a crucifix with the figure cloaked. At South Leigh are remarkable mural paintings of the 15th century. About north of Oxford there are Kidlington (Decorated) with a beautiful needle-like Perpendicular spire, and Islip, which, as the birthplace of Edward the Confessor, retains a connexion with his Abbey of Westminster, the Dean and Chapter of which are lords of the manor and patrons of the living. In the south-east, Dorchester Abbey, with its nave of transitional Norman, has a curious decorated Jesse window, the tracery representing the genealogical tree of the patriarch. At Cuddcsdon there is another large cruciform church, Norman and later. Ewelme church (Perpendicular) is remarkable for the tomb of Alice, Duchess of Suffolk (1475), gorgeous with tracery and gilded canopy, and that of Sir Thomas Chaucer (1434), ornamented with enamelled coats of arms. Here William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk, founded in 1436 the picturesque hospital and free school still standing.

He was born in Munich and fled Nazi Germany after Hitler's Machtergreifung, arriving in the United States by 1939. He is best known for being the editor of the first major revision of the K√∂chel catalogue, which was published in the year 1936. The K√∂chel catalogue is the extensive catalogue of the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Biography Einstein was born in Munich. Though he originally studied law, he quickly realized his principal love was music, and he acquired a doctorate at Munich University, focusing on instrumental music of the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras, in particular music for the viola da gamba. In 1918 he became the first editor of the Zeitschrift f√ºr Musikwissenschaft; slightly later he became music critic for the M√ºnchner Post; and in 1927 became music critic for the Berliner Tageblatt. In this period he was also a friend of the composer Heinrich Kaspar Schmid in Munich and Augsburg. In 1933, after Hitler's rise to power, he left Nazi Germany, moving first to London, then to Italy, and finally to the United States in 1939, where he held a succession of teaching posts at universities including Smith College, Columbia University, Princeton University, the University of Michigan, and the Hartt School of Music in Hartford, Connecticut. Einstein not only researched and wrote detailed works on specific topics, but wrote popular histories of music, including the Short History of Music (1917), and Greatness in Music (1941). In particular, due to his depth of familiarity with Mozart, he published an important and extensive revision of the K√∂chel catalogue of Mozart's music (1936). It is this work for which Einstein is most well known.Author: Einstein, Alfred, Published: New York: Oxford University Press, 1945 and 1962 (paperback) Einstein also published a comprehensive, three-volume set The Italian Madrigal (1949) on the secular Italian form, the first detailed study of the subject. His 1945 volume Mozart: His Character, His Work was an influential study of Mozart and is perhaps his best known book. Relationship to Albert Einstein While one source (1980) lists Alfred as a cousin of the scientist Albert Einstein,Article \\"Alfred Einstein\\", in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed. Stanley Sadie. 20 vol. London, Macmillan Publishers Ltd., 1980. another claims (1993) that no relationship has been verified.The Concise Edition of Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians, 8th ed. Revised by Nicolas Slonimsky. New York, Schirmer Books, 1993. Some websites claim they were both descended from a Moyses Einstein seven generations back, hence they were sixth cousins.Descendants of Baruch Moyses Einstein at Family Tree Maker Online. In 1991, Alfred's daughter Eva stated that they were not related.Catherine Dower: Alfred Einstein on music: selected music criticisms 1991 Page 22 \\"35 According to Eva Einstein, Alfred and Albert Einstein were not related. Alfred's name does not appear on the Albert Einstein family tree.\\" On the other hand, she wrote in 2003 that they were fifth cousins on one side, and fifth cousins once removed on the other, according to research by George Arnstein. They were photographed together in 1947 when Albert Einstein received an honorary doctorate from Princeton, but they did not know that they were distantly related.

Though a member of the Generation of '27, his best-known work dates from the 1940s onwards. Early life and education Born in Madrid in October 22, 1898, Alonso studied Law, Philosophy and Literature before undertaking research at Madrid's Centro de Estudios Hist√≥ricos. An enthusiastic participant in the cultural and literary life at the famous Residencia de estudiantes (which at this time counted among its residents Federico Garc√≠a Lorca, Luis Bu√±uel and Salvador Dal√≠, amongst others), Alonso also wrote for the literary magazines Revista de Occidente ('Western Review') and Los Cuatro Vientos ('The Four Winds'). Academic career Alonso was to become an academic of great renown: he taught Spanish language and literature at several foreign universities, including the University of Oxford and took up a Chair at the University of Valencia between 1933 and 1939 before moving to the University of Madrid. He was elected to the Real Academia Espa√±ola in 1945 and served as its Director between 1968 and 1982, when he was named Director Emeritus. Literary career Alonso's literary career can essentially be split into two convenient blocks. As a poet his early work (such as 1921's Poemas puros; Poemillas de la ciudad and 1925's El viento y el verso) is widely considered inferior to that of his fellow poets in the Generation of '27, and he himself acknowledged his limitations by referring to himself as a 'poeta de rachas' or 'part-time poet'. His mature work, however, particularly Hijos de la ira ('Children of Wrath', 1944, 2nd ed. 1946), is recognised as fundamental in the literature of the post-Civil War years. Alonso's later poetry is also full of agnostic anguish--of a man in search of god, yet fearful of the implications were this God not to exist. As a literary critic Alonso's impact was substantial; in particular he is credited with revolutionizing the study of Spanish Baroque poetry, particularly the work of G√≥ngora, and his critical work was praised for its intellectual rigour. Highlights include Poes√≠a de San Juan de la Cruz (1942), Poes√≠a espa√±ola: Ensayo de m√©todos y l√≠mites estil√≠sticos (1950) and Estudios y ensayos gongorinos (1955). Awards In 1978 Alonso was awarded the Premio Cervantes, the Spanish literary world's highest honour.

Role in \\"English Chess Explosion\\" Barden's most important achievement was his key role in the rapid advance of English chess in the 1970s and 1980s from also-rans to Olympiad silver medal winners.Stuart Milner-Barry wrote in the foreword to The English Chess Explosion: From Miles to Short that the \\"English chess explosion\\" occurred because \\"the fruits were being reaped of the unobtrusive but devoted spade-work in junior training pioneered by Barden, Wade and many others.\\" Chandler and Keene, p. 7. Barden \\"has been involved in junior training and sponsorship for over a decade, and ... was the first to predict the English chess explosion.\\" Id. at back cover. His involvement began in 1971 when he noticed that Tony Miles and Michael Stean were both likely contenders for the biennial 1973 world junior (under-20) championship, but that the only way for a country to have two representatives was to host the event. Barden knew the financier Jim Slater, who offered to co-sponsor the event, which was staged at Teesside. There, Miles and Stean won silver and bronze medals, respectively, and Miles won the title in 1974 when it was changed to an annual contest. Slater also agreed to Barden's proposal that he should finance special coaching by Bob Wade for the five best teenage prospects. They all became grandmasters. In 1972, after Slater had saved the Bobby Fischer versus Boris Spassky world championship match from collapse by doubling the prize fund, he offered ¬£5,000 to the first English grandmaster (who wound up being Miles), and ¬£2,000 to the next four players to qualify. Barden worked out the detailed terms, and wrote the speech at Hastings where Slater announced the awards. Encouraged by success, Barden and Slater then agreed on a wider programme to stimulate talent at much younger ages, aiming to produce a generation which could compete with the Soviet Union, the world's leading chess nation. Barden organised weekend junior invitation events at which the best prospects played a tournament and had coaching from masters between games. They were also introduced to top master chess at the annual Evening Standard weekend open and via grandmaster simultaneous exhibitions. The model was the USSR's own programme in the 1930s, when future masters scored impressively in exhibitions against world-class masters Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca and Salo Flohr during the 1935 and 1936 Moscow tournaments. Very few juniors in the 1970s had international ratings, so Barden compiled his own world ranking lists for every age group from under-18 to under-10, updating the figures at monthly or weekly intervals and posting the results at the invitation events. Barden read much Soviet chess literature, and in 1974 decided that an 11-year-old named Gary Weinstein was a likely future world champion. His Guardian column of 24 February 1975, headlined \\"World Champ 1990\\", made this a specific forecast.Edward Winter, Chess Note 5783 Talent-spotting. Chesshistorycenter.com. Retrieved on 7 October 2019. It was, by more than a year, the first such prediction by anyone for the future Garry Kasparov, who beat Barden's forecast by five years when he won the title in 1985. By summer 1975 Barden believed that Nigel Short, then aged 9, also had world title potential. The simultaneous programme was intensified for Short, who in the next few years played three world champions and several other top grandmasters. Barden also used his columns to promote his juniors, whom some called \\"the Barden babes\\". When Short defeated Viktor Korchnoi, the world's second strongest active player, in a 1976 Evening Standard simultaneous the result was announced on that evening's ITN news bulletin. One purpose of the publicity was to attract more sponsorship, and in summer 1976 Barden secured backing from Lloyds Bank. The bank's chairman, Sir Jeremy Morse, was an eminent chess problemist, and its sponsorship manager, Pat Bowman, liked the concept of the bank financing a serious challenge to Soviet chess supremacy. The first Lloyds Bank event was a pilot, a London v New York City telex match, to celebrate the United States bicentennial, in which the American captain agreed to Barden's proposal to include extra under-11 boards, on one of which Short (who lived near Manchester) beat the future US champion Joel Benjamin. By then many juniors were advancing towards master strength, but lacked official FIDE international ratings and titles. So in 1977 the annual Lloyds Bank Masters in London was launched, modelled on a successful US event at Lone Pine where the best US juniors competed against grandmasters. This legendary Open lasted until 1994 (18th edition, won by Alexander Morozevich). Barden also organised an all-play-all tournament, the Lord John Cup in London, where three young and promising English masters -‚Äì John Nunn, Michael Stean and Jonathan Mestel -‚Äì met reputed international grandmasters as Vlastimil Hort who won this one-off event, Miguel Quinteros, the first winner of the Lloyds Bank Open and joint runner-up at the Lord John Cup, Eugenio Torre, or legendary Alexander Kotov. By 1978, when England won the world under-26 championship at Mexico City ahead of the USSR, and a group financed by Lloyds Bank performed strongly at Lone Pine, the golden generation was on the way to the Olympiad silver medals achieved in 1984, 1986 and 1988. Barden continued to seek new primary school talent, and in 1980 recognised the exceptional promise of the then 8-year-old Michael Adams. Adams lived in Cornwall, far from the major chess centres, so Barden arranged for a Devon organiser, Ken Butt, to stage an annual Lloyds Bank under-18 international tournament in Plymouth. Adams first played there at age 10, and by 12 missed an international master result by only half a point in his Lloyds Bank Masters debut where, in line with Barden's policy of matching the best talents against top grandmasters, he also performed well in a blitz game against Spassky. In 1980, George Low wrote in Education magazine:George Low, \\"The School Seedbed of Britain's Chess Success\\", Education magazine, 7 November 1980, reprinted in Chandler and Keene, pp. 116‚Äì17. > Mr. Leonard Barden, manager of the junior squad, traces the resurgence of > interest to media coverage of the Fischer‚ÄìSpassky duel eight years ago and > its sequel between Korchnoi and Karpov six years later. > In about 1972‚Äì73, he recalls, the selectors started casting their nets much > wider than the Home Counties grammar schools where the recruiting ground had > traditionally been.

By the 1980s the \\"English Chess Explosion\\" was in full swing, but Barden took a lesser role due to having to care for his mother, who suffered from Alzheimer's Disease. He still spotted talents early, notably Matthew Sadler, who debuted in the Lloyds Bank tournament at 11 and became a leading grandmaster in the 1990s. In 1992 when the British Chess Federation was reluctant to send Luke McShane, then 8, to the world under-10 championship in Duisburg, Barden campaigned for a positive outcome which was rewarded when McShane won the gold medal. In 1988‚Äì90, he managed the early programme for David Howell, then 8, who at 16 became England's youngest grandmaster. In recognition of his efforts, Barden was offered an OBE, but declined it. Brian Walden has written that \\"Leonard Barden has done more for British chess than anybody since our famous 19th century champion, Howard Staunton.\\"Brian Walden, in Leonard Barden, Chess: Master the Moves, Barrie & Jenkins, 1977, p. 5. . Chess strength According to Chessmetrics, Barden's best single performance was at Hastings 1957‚Äì58, where he finished fourth behind Paul Keres, Svetozar Gligoriƒá and Miroslav Filip, scoring 5/9 (56%). At his peak, he was likely at or close to International Master strength, but never formally received this title from FIDE, the World Chess Federation. Chessmetrics assigned Barden a peak retrospective rating of 2497 for January 1958, number 187 in the world.chessmetrics.com, the Leonard Barden results file FIDE did not introduce international ratings until 1970, after Barden had virtually stopped competing. However, the Chessmetrics database is missing several of Barden's key results.

After Marlowe's untimely death it was completed by George Chapman. The minor poet Henry Petowe published an alternative completion to the poem. The poem was first published five years after Marlowe's demise. Publication Two editions of the poem were issued in quarto in 1598 (see 1598 in poetry); one, printed by Adam Islip for the bookseller Edward Blount, contained only Marlowe's original, while the other, printed by Felix Kingston for Paul Linley, included both the original and Chapman's continuation. A third edition in 1600, published by John Flasket, printed a title-page advertising the addition of Marlowe's translation of Book I of Lucan's Pharsalia to the original poem, though the book itself merely adds Chapman's portion. The fourth edition of 1606, again from Flasket, abandoned any pretence of including the Lucan and once again joined Marlowe's and Chapman's poems together; this was the format followed in subsequent 17th-century editions (1609, 1613, 1629, 1637 and after).A. H. Bullen, ed., The Works of Christopher Marlowe, Vol. 3; London, John C. Nimmo, 1885; pp. 3‚Äì4; Fredson Bowers, ed., The Complete Works of Christopher Marlowe, vol. 2; Cambridge Univ. Press, 1973; pg. 426. Story Hero laments the dead Leander by Jan van den Hoecke, c. 1637 Marlowe's poem relates the Greek legend of Hero and Leander, young lovers living in cities on opposite sides of the Hellespont, a narrow stretch of the sea in what is now northwestern Turkey, and which separates Europe and Asia. Hero is a priestess or devotee of Venus (goddess of love and beauty) in Sestos, who lives in chastity despite being devoted to the goddess of love. At a festival in honour of her deity, Venus and Adonis, she is seen by Leander, a youth from Abydos on the opposite side of the Hellespont. Leander falls in love with her, and she reciprocates, although cautiously, as she has made a vow of chastity to Venus. Leander convinces her to abandon her fears. Hero lives in a high tower overlooking the water; he asks her to light a lamp in her window, and he promises to swim the Hellespont each night to be with her. She complies. On his first night's swim, Leander is spotted by Neptune (Roman god of the sea), who confuses him with Ganymede and carries him to the bottom of the ocean. Discovering his mistake, the god returns him to shore with a bracelet supposed to keep him safe from drowning. Leander emerges from the Hellespont, finds Hero's tower and knocks on the door, which Hero then opens to find him standing stark naked. She lets him \\"whisper in her ear, / Flatter, entreat, promise, protest, and swear,\\" and after a series of coy, half-hearted attempts to \\"defend the fort\\" she yields to bliss. The poem breaks off as dawn is breaking. No critical consensus exists on the issue of how Marlowe, had he lived, would have finished the poem, or indeed if he would have finished it at all. Genre, source, and style The poem may be called an epyllion, that is, a \\"little epic\\": it is longer than a lyric or elegy, but concerned with love rather than with traditional epic subjects, and it has a lengthy digression ‚Äì in this case, Marlowe's invented story of how scholars became poor. Marlowe certainly knew the story as told by both Ovid and by the Byzantine poet Mus√¶us Grammaticus; Musaeus appears to have been his chief source.Millar Maclure (ed.), Christopher Marlowe, The Poems, London, Methuen & Co. Ltd., 1968; p. xxv. Yet if Musaeus and Ovid gave it impetus, the poem is marked by Marlowe's unique style of extravagant fancy and violent emotion. Perhaps the most famous instance of these qualities in the poem is the opening description of Hero's costume, which includes a blue skirt stained with the blood of \\"wretched lovers slain\\" and a veil woven with flowers so realistic that she is continually forced to swat away bees. The final encounter of the two lovers is even more frenzied, with the two at times appearing closer to blows than to embraces. Adaptation In Bartholomew Fair, Ben Jonson lampoons the poem in the fair's puppet show; his Hellespont is the River Thames, and his Leander is a dyer's son in Puddle-wharf. A poem based to some extent on Marlowe's text was set to music around 1628 by the composer Nicholas Lanier; this may have been one of the earliest works in recitative in English. King Charles I was fond of the work, and had Lanier perform it repeatedly; Samuel Pepys also admired it, and had it transcribed by his \\"domestic musician\\", Cesare Morelli.Robert Latham, ed. The Diary of Samuel Pepys, Vol. X, Berkeley, C. A., University of California Press, 2000; p. 269. Hero and Leander is also the only identifiable work of a contemporary writer quoted in any of the plays of William Shakespeare, specifically in As You Like It.Wells, Stanley Shakespeare for All Time, London, Oxford University Press, 2003; p. 53.

It was reconstituted as a district of Leicestershire in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972. This district was given unitary authority status on 1 April 1997. Early history The north-western part of the county of Rutland was recorded as Rutland, a detached part of Nottinghamshire, in the Domesday Book; the south-eastern part as the wapentake of Wicelsea in Northamptonshire. It was first mentioned as a separate county in 1159, but as late as the 14th century it was referred to as the 'Soke of Rutland'. In 1584 Uppingham School, one of the earliest \\"public\\" (actually private) schools of England, was founded in Rutland with a hospital, or almshouse, by Archdeacon Robert Johnson. The original 1584 Schoolroom still exists in Uppingham churchyard. The original hospital building is now incorporated in the School Library. The first recorded Uppingham schoolboy was Henry Ferne from York, who was Chaplain to Charles I. Earl of Rutland and Duke of Rutland are titles in the peerage of England held in the Manners family, derived from the traditional county of Rutland. The Earl of Rutland was elevated to the status of Duke in 1703 and the titles were merged. The family seat is at Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire. Modern history A map of Rutland from Darton's New miniature atlas (1820) The hundreds of Rutland By the time of the 19th century it had been divided into the hundreds of Alstoe, East, Martinsley, Oakham and Wrandike. Rutland covered parts of three poor law unions and rural sanitary districts (RSDs): those of Oakham, Uppingham and Stamford. The registration county of Rutland contained the entirety of Oakham and Uppingham RSDs, which included several parishes in Leicestershire and Northamptonshire - the eastern part in Stamford RSD was included in the Lincolnshire registration county. Rutland gained its own county council by virtue of the Local Government Act 1888 In 1894 under the Local Government Act 1894 the rural sanitary districts were partitioned along county boundaries to form three rural districts. The part of Oakham and Uppingham RSDs in Rutland formed the Oakham Rural District and Uppingham Rural District, with the two parishes from Oakham RSD in Leicestershire becoming part of the Melton Mowbray Rural District, the 9 parishes of Uppingham RSD in Leicestershire becoming the Hallaton Rural District, and the 6 parishes of Uppingham RSD in Northamptonshire becoming Gretton Rural District. Meanwhile, that part of Stamford RSD in Rutland became the Ketton Rural District. Oakham was split out from Oakham Rural District in 1911 as an urban district.Oakham UD Rutland through time  Administrative history of Local Government District: hierarchies, boundaries Rutland was included in the \\"East Midlands General Review Area\\" of the 1958-1967 Local Government Commission for England. Draft recommendations would have seen Rutland split, with Ketton Rural District going along with Stamford to a new administrative county of Cambridgeshire, and the western part be added to Leicestershire. The final proposals were less radical and instead proposed that Rutland become a single rural district within the administrative county of Leicestershire.Little Rutland To Go It Alone - No Merger with Leicestershire. The Times. 2 August 1963. This victory was to prove only temporary, with Rutland being included in the new non- metropolitan county of Leicestershire under the Local Government Act 1972, from 1 April 1974. Under proposals for non-metropolitan districts Rutland would have been paired with what now constitutes the Melton district - the revised and implemented proposals made Rutland a standalone non-metropolitan district (breaking the 40,000 minimum population barrier). In 1994, the Local Government Commission for England, which was conducting a structural review of English local government, recommended that Rutland become a unitary authority. This was implemented on 1 April 1997, with Rutland regaining a separate Lieutenancy as well as its council regaining control of county functions such as education and social services. The council remained formally a non- metropolitan district council, with wards rather than electoral divisions, but has renamed the district to 'Rutland County Council' to allow it to use that name. This means the full legal name of the council is Rutland County Council District Council.

Over the years which followed it developed a strong following in the liner ports of Southampton, Glasgow, London, Bristol and Hull. In 1911 the union supported the seamen's strikes which broke out in all major British ports. In 1921, the National Maritime Board imposed wage reductions for marine workers with the support and assistance of the principal seamen's union, the National Sailors' and Firemen's Union. The National Union of Ship's Stewards refused to endorse this move and instead supported attempts to resist the reductions.

It was produced by the Historical Section of the Committee of Imperial Defence from 1915 to 1949; after 1919 Brigadier-General Sir James Edmonds was Director. Edmonds wrote many of the army volumes and influenced the choice of historians for the navy, air force, medical and veterinary volumes. Work had begun on the series in 1915 and in 1920, the first volumes of Naval Operations and Seaborne Trade, were published. The first \\"army\\" publication, Military Operations: France and Belgium 1914 Part I and a separate map case were published in 1922 and the final volume, The Occupation of Constantinople was published in 2010. The History of the Great War Military Operations volumes were originally intended as a technical history for military staff. Single-volume popular histories of military operations and naval operations written by civilian writers, were to be produced for the general public but Sir John Fortescue was dismissed for slow work on the military volume and his draft was not published. Edmonds preferred to appoint half-pay and retired officers, who were cheaper than civilian writers and wrote that occasionally the \\"'War House' foisted elderly officers on him, because they were not going to be promoted or offered employment but was afraid to tell them so\\". In the 1987 introduction to Operations in Persia 1914‚Äì1919, G. M. Bayliss wrote that the guides issued by Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO) were incomplete. \\"Sectional List number 60\\" of 1976 omitted the Gallipoli volumes but contained The Blockade of the Central Empires (1937), that had been Confidential and retained \\"For Official Use Only\\" until 1961. The twelve volume History of the Ministry of Munitions, the Occupation of the Rhineland (1929) and Operations in Persia 1914‚Äì1919 (1929) were included. The Imperial War Museum Department of Printed Books and the Battery Press republished the official history in the 1990s with black and white maps. The Department of Printed Books and the Naval and Military Press republished the set in paperback with colour maps in the 2000s and on DVD-ROM in the 2010s. Background =Official history= The modern form of official military history began in the mid-nineteenth century with reports written as guides for later officers. The histories were detailed descriptions of events, were not easy reading for a lay audience and left judgements to the discretion of a mainly professional readership. After the First World War, the New Zealand government decided that its official histories should be written for the public, since it had fought in the war or supported the war effort. After the Second World War, the low academic standard of military education, especially in historical analysis, led to a view that professionally trained historians should write official histories, applying their academic training to explain why as well as describe what. Since many of the academics had participated in the war, they could be expected to have experience of military service and knowledge of the war to inform their writing. The contemporary view is that official history should incorporate the three points of view, containing the detailed description needed for works of military instruction but also to be suitable for a general readership and to show how participants tried to solve problems, drawing explicit lessons from their successes and failures. None of the points of view to be served by the production of official history is immune to error, because work by a military historian can be fraudulent, distorting the record for personal or political reasons. Populist history can dilute the story to the point of worthlessness and civilian academics can be prone to select facts and interpretations according to their ideals, ideology and preconceived ideas. Military histories written as textbooks might be expected to have a basis in truth, necessary to teach useful lessons to students and the British Report of the Committee on the Lessons of the Great War (Kirk Report, 1931) drew on the published volumes of the British official history; conclusions in the report were incorporated into a new edition of Field Service Regulations. Operations might again be conducted in Iraq and Iran and official history volumes were produced against the objections of the Foreign Office. Military histories concentrated on the doings of national contingents, rarely referring to those of allied and opposing armies; comparative analysis is absent and national bias, due to ulterior motives like the temptation to myth-make, can also be found. The Australian Official History of Australia in the War of 1914‚Äì1918 edited by Charles Bean contains exaggerations of the significance of the Australian contribution, the prowess of Australian soldiers and disparagements of soldiers from Britain and its allies. Australian failures and casualties are sometimes blamed on British higher commanders, when high-ranking Australian officers could justly be criticised. After the First World War, the Royal Air Force (RAF) was at risk of abolition and needed to justify its existence with a function that could not be fulfilled by the army or navy. The parts of The War in the Air (1922‚Äì1937) written by H. A. Jones gave undue emphasis to strategic bombing, unbalancing the work. Embarrassing events could be disguised by underwriting and in the French official history , the French Army Mutinies of 1917 were passed over in a few paragraphs, despite occurring in of the French Army. Many of the historians, editors and contributors to the History of the Great War (1915‚Äì1949) had been senior officers during the war, which had the advantage of bringing first-hand knowledge of events and experience of military art to the work but risked allowing loyalty and an understandable desire to protect reputations leading to unfair blaming, particularly on outsiders. The narrative of the Battle of Jutland (1916) is described in Volume III of the Royal Navy history Naval Operations (1923). The draft text was revised at the request of some serving officers present at the battle to remove critical remarks about them. Many of these officers were retired or dead when a revised edition was published in 1940 but the excised passages were not restored. The British Army Military Operations.... volumes have been criticised for dishonesty, in not blaming GHQ for the extent of British casualties. The authors have been accused of exculpating Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) from December 1915 to the end of the war, by default. In 2011, Neil Wells wrote that as the history is a description of events, rather than an analytical work with criticism and conclusions, Haig and other commanders escape explicit blame for failures, yet the reader is left free to form conclusions. =British official history= In 1906, official histories were being written by three departments at the War Office and one in the Admiralty. Lord Esher chairman of the Committee of Imperial Defence, suggested that a subcommittee be established as the Historical Section, to centralise the collection of army and navy archives, as a repository of the lessons of war for strategists. Esher thought that the lessons of the South African War (11 October 1899 ‚Äì 31 May 1902) could not be shown unless the naval, military and political aspects of the war were treated as one. In January 1907, the subcommittee was established with Sir George Clarke as chairman, charged with the completion of an official history of the Boer War. The original account was begun by Colonel George Henderson (1854‚Äì1903), before ill health forced him to retire. Before he died, Henderson had completed a narrative up to the beginning of the war but it was not published. A later version, (History of the war in South Africa 1899‚Äì1902, four volumes, 1906‚Äì1910) by Major-General John Maurice reached publication but had needed a large number of assistants which increased the price of the book; it was favourably received but did not sell well. =Histories of the Great War= The Historical Section was busy on a history of the Russo-Japanese War (8 February 1904 ‚Äì 5 September 1905) in August 1914 but work was suspended on the outbreak of the First World War. The section began to collect material being returned from France and Lieutenant-Colonel E. Y. Daniel was appointed as full-time secretary. Experience of writing the history of the South African War showed that delay made the task impossible and that the collection of material for the work should begin at once. In May 1915, Captain C. T. Atkinson was sent to France to collect unit diaries. Atkinson reported that the diaries were inadequate, because of the difficulty of writing them during events like the Great Retreat of 1914, when few were kept and those that were had big gaps. Although the diaries would not show why events occurred, Atkinson recommended that they should be indexed and grouped by unit, subject and chronology for later scrutiny to identify discrepancies caused by the organisation of the material. A formal decision to write an official history was not taken until a Cabinet meeting on 26 August 1915, when Maurice Hankey (1 April 1877 ‚Äì 26 January 1963) the Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence and of the War Council, advocated a series of histories to provide Field Marshal Herbert Kitchener (24 June 1850 ‚Äì 5 June 1916) the Secretary of State for War wanted work begun on a single-volume popular history, to be published soon after the war. This would maintain public interest in the main series and put the case of the government at the same time as accounts by participants and popular authors. The Treasury objected over the cost but Hankey considered that it would be a work of education and reference, not a commercial proposition and that if scientific works were judged only on commercial criteria, research would be abolished. The Treasury gave way and agreed to finance an official history series and popular single- volume works, written by civilian authors to ensure public appeal. Sir Julian Corbett (12 November 1854 ‚Äì 21 September 1922) was appointed to write the navy volume and Sir John Fortescue (28 December 1859 ‚Äì 22 October 1933) was chosen for the army volume. Work on the military histories was slow and in 1917, Daniel reported that Atkinson and an assistant had examined only diaries and that Fortescue had only reached as far as November 1914. The war precluded a big increase in manpower and for the Fortescue volume to be adequate, Daniel reported that confidential staff correspondence would be needed. With the huge increase in the size of the British army, it would only be practical to use some unit diaries and care would be needed to avoid skewing the selection. In March 1919, Winston Churchill (30 November 1874 ‚Äì 24 January 1965) received a pre-publication copy of the Corbett popular history of the navy and objected to certain passages. Churchill wanted official records to be published with the volume so that the public could judge for themselves. Hankey claimed that Churchill's objections made the publication of an official history series questionable, since they would inevitably reflect on leaders, many of whom remained in public life. Hankey wrote that an official history should not be written, because it would attract parliamentary and public criticism, the length of time taken to publish would mean that each volume would be examined and that the history would be produced at a loss. The experience of producing the navy volume also showed that each publication would but the objections were not enough to cancel the project, given the benefits of publication. The public knew little of the early stages of the war and it had a right to benefit from the state monopoly on official information, presented in a readable manner. An official history would also serve to educate professional officers, that mattered more than cost and that criticism was unavoidable. Publication would refute unofficial histories that blamed the government or individual officers and for this, the histories could not evade controversy or be inoffensive to individual sensibilities. The Cabinet agreed for publication to continue, subject to vetting by the War Office and the Cabinet, with the proviso that the decision might be reversed if the Corbett volume was badly received; the volume was published in 1920 to extremely good press reviews. Work on the military histories in 1919 was hampered by paucity of resources and bad management, until Brigadier-General James Edmonds (25 December 1861 ‚Äì 2 August 1956), who had joined the Historical Section in February 1919, was appointed Director on 1 April. Edmonds found documents in un-catalogued bundles on the floor, from which historians had abstracted items and not replaced them. The Fortescue volume was to have covered the war but he wrote so slowly that it was decided to end his volume at May 1915 and only cover France. Edmonds also came to doubt the quality of the work, judging Fortescue to be ignorant of the workings of a contemporary army, apparently being behind the times; Fortescue had excluded dates and times and used obsolete language; he agreed to revise his draft but then took no notice, his second draft being confused, containing nothing about the general situation and hardly referring to the Germans. Senior officers were ridiculed, the government blamed for not stopping the war and the French effort was \\"slurred over in less than one typewritten page\\". Edmonds blamed Fortescue for lacking interest, lethargy and ignoring the records made available, bungling the chance to write an exciting story of the BEF by delivering a patchwork of unit diaries. At the end of the year, Edmonds decided to rewrite the work because of Fortescue's prevarication and \\"grossly inaccurate and misleading\\" writing; Fortescue was sacked and Edmonds even wanted him to be made to pay back his salary. After the unfortunate experience with Fortescue, Edmonds decided that an account must be enhanced by statements, private records of officers and by German material, to counter \\"garbled\\" accounts by the likes of Arthur Conan Doyle and John Buchan. Soundings with publishers and authors convinced Edmonds that a work based on dispatches would fail to engage the public. An educational work needed a foundation on which to base teaching, conclusions which were similar to those of Hankey, that a work must be readable enough for the public to buy, be a credible educational work for the military student and rebut inaccurate commercial accounts by civilian authors. Prelude =Finance= The cost of producing the official history was raised in the House of Commons on 13 June 1922, during a proposal to farm out the work to private enterprise. Some MPs claimed to have heard nothing of the History.... despite five volumes having been published to a very good press. Daniel was called before H. A. L. Fisher, the President of the Board of Education and pointed out that working on the History.... would never pay a living wage and that for educational reasons the government must foot the bill, because of the exceptional value of the work. He calculated that the cost of the \\"History.... from 1916 to 1922 was about ¬£42,000, the military histories costing ¬£16,800 and the naval works ¬£11,800, while the annual cost of producing Hansard was ¬£44,000\\". Daniel also showed that the cost of the war from 3 August 1914 to 31 March 1920 was ¬£11,196,927,000 or ¬£3,500 per minute, a vast cost, against which the price of making the experience available for education was about four minutes of war expenditure per year for the Historical Section. The next meeting of the Historical Section subcommittee on 31 July 1922 endorsed the continuation of the project. Finance remained the dominant influence on the production of the volumes, rather than literary or academic concerns about the work of the Historical Section. The subcommittee met six times in 1923 and on 9 August, Hankey managed to obtain a permanent Cabinet Subcommittee of Control of the Official Histories, chaired by the President of the Board of Education and meeting annually. There were twelve meetings between 1924 and 1946, with representatives from the Treasury, War Office, Admiralty, Air Ministry and the Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence. Daniel and Edmonds usually attended; other official historians and members of the Colonial and India offices were present for particular discussions; where the committee failed to agree, a ruling was made by the Cabinet. Edmonds submitted an annual report, other historians added summaries of their work, progress reports, staff and personnel matters and publications by foreign official historians. Meetings considered costs and the progress of publication, the number of volumes, their scope and size. On rare occasions the committee made a ruling on content, after complaints by a department; in 1928, the War Office strenuously objected to some of the content of the first Gallipoli volume by C. F. Aspinall- Oglander. Money determined the speed of publication, the size and number of volumes and the choice of author, Edmonds preferring to employ officers on half-pay or retired on ¬£500 per year, about half the price of a civilian author; officers were usually willing to work longer hours and do unpaid work. The Treasury managed to obtain the removal of Lieutenant-General Launcelot Kiggell, former Chief of the General Staff of the British Armies in France (late 1915 to early 1918) from 1918 Part I for reasons of cost. In 1923, it had been decided to prepare the volume out of sequence because of the importance of the failure of the German Spring Offensive (21 March ‚Äì 18 July 1918) but by 1926, Kiggell had failed to prepare even a draft narrative for circulation to participants and thought that it would take him another four years to complete the work. At the Committee for Control meeting in January 1926, the Treasury recommended Kiggell's dismissal and Edmonds agreed, because his work was \\"lacking in colour and atmosphere\\". =Commerce= The price of the early volumes was set at 21 Shillings (21s) and another 21s for accompanying map cases but this was considered too costly for professional officers. In 1923, the price was cut to 12s 6d but this left no surplus for advertising and no incentive for booksellers to display them prominently; publishers also set a maximum number of pages per volume, a constraint that led the Committee for Control in 1924 to advise a price increase to 15s. In March 1933, Edmonds showed copies of French, German and Austrian histories to demonstrate their \\"elaborate and voluminous\\" nature. The comprehensive nature of the project was also determined by finance and proposals made by government departments from 1922 to 1939, for histories beyond the Western Front. In 1931, the War Office asked for a volume on the East African Campaign, because of lessons offered by a campaign in such a climate, at such a distance from Britain. The Treasury refused and suggested that the Colonial Office pay, as it had done for the West African volume. East Africa Part I was eventually published in 1941 with Colonial Office money. At the same meeting, the Foreign Office asked for a volume on the Blockade of Germany at their expense, because of the lessons that could be learned and its utility in conferences on international law; by being labelled Confidential it could be written frankly. Several volumes were financed by interested departments but Edmonds retained supervision and maintained the same editorial control as for the other volumes. Parsimony affected the organisation of the Historical Section and the speed it could publish the History.... Premises, visits to battlefields and the number of historians and administrators were limited and in 1922, Edmonds threatened to resign if denied more help. Along with Daniel and Edmonds, the section had only three or four full-time officers, who had to write the volumes, prepare them for publication, maintain the library, study prisoner of war (POW) records and foreign official and non-official publications (in their native language) and provide help for the War Office, War Graves Commission, Staff College, educational establishments and government departments. The section had about a year to its cramped offices in Cavendish Square, until it moved to the Audit Office in 1922. By 1924, Edmonds had five administrators and eight writers, when the French and German equivalents had about the British staff were also underpaid, A. F. Becke being refused a salary increase from ¬£500 per annum. Edmonds got the money instead, from ¬£560 to ¬£800 per annum and then ¬£1,000 per annum in 1924, when he was writing most of the histories, managing the section and working a seven-day-week for three months, then taking ten days off (Edmonds worked like this for much of the of the project). A 1927 proposal for Cyril Falls (2 March 1888 ‚Äì 23 April 1971) to visit Mesopotamia for ¬£200 was vetoed by the Treasury but ¬£50 was allowed for Aspinall-Oglander to visit Gallipoli. =Official documents= The British Expeditionary Forces were the largest ever army the British state had raised and by 1924 it had generated more than documents; Edmonds thought they would take nine years to sort. When he took up his duties, Edmonds found the papers in heaps in the floor and apparently summarily sacked the Chief Clerk, for refusing to climb a ladder to retrieve a bundle. Edmonds complained that his predecessor, C. T. Atkinson, had let historians plunder the packets of documents and not return items; it had taken until June 1923 to catalogue the records. The first draft of a volume was prepared by a \\"narrator\\", who sorted, read and analysed the documents. The result was revised by the \\"historian\\" who added comments and a conclusion. The draft was then sent to participants down to battalion commanders, other senior military officers, politicians and government departments. The draft for 1916 Part I (including the First Day on the Somme) was sent to who, by 1931, had sent Comments on the first chapter created a pile high and Edmonds complained that his staff was insufficient, considering that he had briefed them that all names, initials, ranks and numbers had to be checked and then cross-checked with the French and German accounts; the small number of staff slowed production. In 1922, Edmonds had calculated that it would take twenty years to write ten volumes, a feat that the French had achieved in three years. It took (excluding 1939‚Äì1945) to produce Front volumes and on other theatres. =Content= While finance determined the speed of the writing of volumes, Edmonds as Director had the greater influence on the literary and academic integrity of the work. In the first volume published in 1922, Edmonds wrote in the preface, that \\"no deviation from the truth nor misrepresentation will be found in the official histories on which my name appeared\\". Edmonds' claim has been challenged ever since, leading to a common assumption that the work is vapid at best and at worst fraudulent, a partial, misleading and exculpatory account of the military establishment. In 1934, Liddell Hart questioned the integrity of the writers, calling 1918 Part I \\"patriotic\\" and \\"parochial\\". Norman Brook, one of the official historians, claimed in 1945, that Edmonds could not be trusted to revise 1916 Part I, because he had succumbed to the temptation to interpolate his views. In 1976, John Keegan (15 May 1934 ‚Äì 2 August 2012) wrote In 1985, David French wrote that Edmonds \\"...has a private purpose to conceal the truth about the high command in France from the lay public....\\" and that Edmonds had become concerned to refute claims by politicians that Haig wasted lives on futile offensives; Edmonds' subjects were heroes and beyond criticism. Tim Travers wrote that Edmonds eschewed direct criticism of senior officers, was obliged to Haig and protected his reputation, rigged facts and drew false conclusions in the volumes on the Somme (1916 Part I), Passchendaele (1917 Part II) and 1918 Part I. In 1996, Paddy Griffith (4 February 1947 ‚Äì 25 June 2010) called it an \\"...encyclopaedic work, transparently individualistic in tone, lucidly organised, wide in scope and by far the best book on the Western Front.\\". Griffith called the quantity of writing on the Great War \\"prodigious\\" and that despite Edmonds being unstable, insecure and having never held a field appointment, he was conscientious, intelligent and rarely allowed his devious and opinionated nature to distort his work on the official history. Edmonds determined the presentation of information, which imposed constraints on the authors. All but implied criticism was to be avoided and the author was to resist the temptation to be \\"wise after the event\\". Disclosure of facts about opponents was to be kept to small-type footnotes or in notes at the end of chapters, because introducing facts not known at the time was hindsight, which was unfair and un-scholarly. A conclusion could be written for reflection and comment but not for fault- finding. For Edmonds, the constraints were necessary for the facts innocuously to be shown to the lay reader, yet be available to experts reading between the lines. After Henry FitzMaurice Stacke, the first author of Military Operations: East Africa, Volume I died and Charles Hordern was appointed as replacement, Hordern wrote that Stacke had been frustrated by being obliged to The avoidance of hindsight was consistent with the education Edmonds received at the Staff College on the teaching of Carl von Clausewitz (1 June 1780 ‚Äì 16 November 1831), that the critic must only use the information available to a commander and his motives, rather than what the commander did not and could not know. Using knowledge after the event could show arrogance and a lack of critical judgement. In writing the first Gallipoli volume (1929), Cecil Aspinall-Oglander ignored the convention and on the draft copy, Edmonds called his account biased and lacking in the objective judgement necessary for an official historian. When Aspinall-Oglander refused to revise his text, Edmonds criticised him for a complaint which had been occasionally levelled at Edmonds by the War Office and several participants in the war. Despite the constraints that Edmonds imposed on the form of the official histories, Andrew Green called his accounts accurate and comprehensive. Edmonds's correspondence with Basil Liddell Hart shows that Hart valued the official history and offered constructive criticism. Green wrote that when David French called the work \\"official but not history\\", he had used Hart's words out of context, Liddell Hart meaning that by leaving potentially controversial details to be read between the lines, Edmonds created the risk that later historians might use the phrase \\"official but not history\\", to describe the volumes. Publishing =Persia, 1914‚Äì1919= In October 1920, the Government of India provided money for a record of the Indian contribution to the world war and chose Brigadier-General F. J. Moberly (15 September 1867 ‚Äì 6 April 1952) to write the official account of the Mesopotamian Campaign (6 November 1914 ‚Äì 14 November 1918). Moberly published it in four volumes from 1923 to 1927 and in 1926 the Government of India requested an additional volume on the Persian Campaign (December 1914 ‚Äì 30 October 1918). The work was nearly finished by September 1927, when the Government of India had doubts about publication on political grounds, because it would be dangerous to disclose intrigues with Iranian governments and individuals. The most helpful Iranian factions would come badly out of a volume that denigrated their assistance and \\"...the less we bring Afghanistan into the narrative the better for us\\". Sir Denys Bray of the Foreign and Political Department (Army Headquarters, India) supported the \\"excellent written\\" history but wanted it lodged in the Confidential records. Stephen Gaslee of the Foreign Office wrote to Daniel in October 1927, about his concern that the government of the Soviet Union (USSR) might publish information from the Russian Empire on Iran. Gaslee felt that Soviet disclosures might put the British government at a disadvantage, if a censored version of British involvement in Iran had already been published; instead he preferred a comprehensive history kept Confidential. General G. M. Kirkpatrick (Chief of the General Staff [India] from 1916 to 1920), took the view that discussion of the Seistan Strategy might upset Iranian sensibilities. Sir Percy Cox (20 November 1864 ‚Äì 20 February 1937) who had been Chief Political Officer of Indian Expeditionary Force D, told Moberly that it was a fine piece of work, free from bias. Moberly wrote to Cox that avoiding controversy would render the volume valueless, making it impossible to justify British involvement in Iran to the public. Moberly referred to sensitivity over the \\"corrupt and self-interested attitude\\" of most Iranian politicians during the war and British fears of unrest in Afghanistan. Cox agreed that a bowdlerised account would be worthless and that Moberly should write without fear or favour, if necessary securing a commercial publisher. At a meeting of the Committee on Official Histories on 9 March 1928, the volume was limited For Official Use Only and since this would increase the cost of the volume, His Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO) agreed to pay for it. Moberly finished the work in May 1928, then in September, after the Foreign Office and the Government of India had approved the text, Lord Peel, Secretary of State for India, insisted that the politics of the military operations be removed and the last three chapters re-written, because even in a volume restricted For Official Use Only, the disclosure of secrets was most objectionable. Moberly wrote that if officers were to benefit from the experience of wartime events in Iran, the exceptional nature of political factors there and in neighbouring countries could not be ignored. Moberly wrote that he understood the need for care in writing the history and that the chapters had been vetted informally by the Foreign Office and approved by Cox, who as an expert in the field, was well qualified to balance secrecy with the needs of army students. At a meeting of the Committee on Official Histories on 26 March 1929, it was ruled that the volume would be marked Confidential in Britain and Secret in India. Edmonds had objected to the Confidential label, since it would be withheld from young officers but was over-ruled. A limited edition of copies was printed by HMSO in late 1929, with marked Secret and sent to the Government of India. In March 1930, copies of the Confidential volume were supplied to the Imperial War Museum (IWM) library among others and in February 1933, HMSO destroyed the last copies; in 1987 the IWM published a facsimile copy of the volume at ¬£24 net. =Rhineland, 1918‚Äì1929= In 1930, Edmonds proposed a volume on the occupation in the Rhine Province by British Army on the Rhine (BAOR), to counter a recent German book but the Treasury refused to pay. Edmonds hoped that the War Office would find the money, began to collect information from former commanders and staffs of the BAOR and ensured the storage of BAOR records. By 1939, poor offices, lack of promotions and government parsimony, led him to complain that the official history, a national memorial, was being neglected. When Daniel retired in late 1939, Edmonds took on the duties of Secretary as well as Director and on 15 November, the Historical Section was evacuated to St. Anne's on Sea, Lancashire and thence to the National Library of Wales at Aberystwyth in April 1942. In February, the Committee for the Control of Official Histories decided to let Edmonds write the volume. R. A. Butler, President of the Board of Education, said that the volume would be useful as a historical background for the Armistice and disarmament terms to be imposed on Germany. In 1987, Bayliss wrote that utility was the main criterion but that it also kept Edmonds busy, having been passed over for the writing of the official histories of the Second World War. Edmonds was pleased because he saw it as the final volume of his Western Front campaign history. Edmonds felt qualified to write the volume, having visited the Rhineland during the occupation, having gained specialist knowledge of the law of military government working with Professor L. F. L. Oppenheim (30 March 1858 ‚Äì 7 October 1919) in 1912 on The Laws and Usages of War and being on good terms with many of the senior officers involved. Edmonds was hampered by a 1942 air raid, that burnt many of the records stored at Walworth in London. At Aberystwyth, Edmonds was isolated from metropolitan libraries and short of researchers. Requests for help from the Director of the Imperial War Museum had little effect, since his books had been moved to Barnstaple in Devon and because coverage of the occupation and inter-war period was sparse, owing to the usual lack of money. Edmonds was still able to glean plenty of details and gossip from senior officers in the occupation. General Charles Fergusson (17 January 1865 ‚Äì 20 February 1951), a former military governor of Cologne, said that he disliked Field Marshal William Robertson (29 January 1860 ‚Äì 12 February 1933) and that the enmity had led him to resign, despite being on good terms with General Herbert Plumer (13 March 1857 ‚Äì 16 July 1932). Major-General Archibald Montgomery-Massingberd, Chief of Staff of the BAOR, criticised Robertson for being too fussy, Fergusson for pro-German sympathies and told Plumer that Fergusson was too much of a gentleman for the job. Plumer had asked if it were possible to be too much of a gentleman and Massingberd reminisced that he had said Due to the hostilities, Edmonds was unable to correspond and exchange material with German researchers and was allowed only a galley proof and one page proof. In October 1943, Edmonds complained that speed and economy mattered more than respect for military history. Edmonds hoped that the volume would have educational use, in the event that Britain would again occupy foreign lands and that Edmonds struggled to produce an impartial history of the occupation and draft copies sent to the War Office and Foreign Office, led Brigadier W. L. van Cutsen for the War Office to complain that the volume should have been more broadly written and that administrative and other details were overly detailed but he found the chapter on the operations of the British Upper Silesia Force helpful. Far worse criticism came from the Foreign Office on 3 January 1944, the text being called often misleading and incomplete, without the inclusion of much controversial material. It was suggested that the value of the volume would be enhanced by the reduction of political references to mere facts and dates. Examples included a desire to describe the murder of Kurt von Schleicher (7 April 1882 ‚Äì 30 June 1934) \\"in the purge of 30 June 1934\\" rather than \\"by Hitler\\" in Edmonds' draft. Unemployment pay should never be referred to as a \\"dole\\" as this implied that British men had enlisted in the pre-1914 army to avoid starvation and Lloyd George (17 January 1863 ‚Äì 26 March 1945) might resent being portrayed as \\"less well-disposed\\" to Germany, than Bonar Law (16 September 1858 ‚Äì 30 October 1923). More examples were quoted and ended on Edmonds' description of the Locarno Treaties (5‚Äì16 October 1925) with \\"...it is most improper for an official historian to describe a treaty concluded by His Majesty's Government as 'verbiage'\\". Edmonds retorted that he would ignore the criticisms as they were \\"trifling or silly\\", except for a request to cut a comment that Viscount D'Abernon, Ambassador to Germany (1920‚Äì1925) was pro-German. Edmonds pointed out that the views were his, not officially endorsed and that the official history should not be determined by the War Office, Admiralty or Foreign Office. The volume had been based on official documents and he stood by it. The source of the criticism was Charles Webster (25 July 1886 ‚Äì August 1961), who had written memoranda analysing the Armistice and military occupation, ready for the anticipated re-occupation of Germany. Edmonds was most critical of one of the documents and wrote to Webster defending Haig. Obstacles were placed between him and his detractors, with the intention of protecting his feelings, because the Foreign Office harboured another critic, Llewellyn Woodward (1890‚Äì1971), who called the book episodic, with slurred chronology and a narrative of the controversy over provisioning the occupied territories, that was misleading; criticism of civilian authorities lacked evidence and was \\"dogmatic and prejudiced\\". Woodward, less critical than Webster, asked him to spare Edmonds' feelings but Webster found the book lacking in analytical rigour, refused to devote more time to it and R. A. Butler, Chairman of the Committee on the Control of Official Histories, got the job of rejecting the book for publication. In July 1944, over Edmonds' objections, it was decided to print a hundred copies For Official Use Only but only after many Foreign Office demands had been conceded, including cuts to the preface. Work on the volume had begun in 1930, resumed in September 1942 and was completed in draft in July 1943. Ready to print in May 1944, the order came on 31 July for a limited edition by HMSO, because the small print run made it impossible for Macmillan to realise a profit. Edmonds later tried to have the small issue made public but in November 1947, HMSO was ordered to destroy the type of the book. (The volume remained unseen, until the Fifty-year Rule was amended to the Thirty-year rule in 1967, that allowed the public to view the surviving copies.) The failings of the volume raised questions as to the suitability of Edmonds continuing as Director of the Historical Section for the rest of the series but given that it was beyond his normal area of expertise, he was allowed to carry on and produced a short account of the Occupation of Constantinople, saw the remaining volumes on the Western Front through to publication and retired in July 1949, just before the publication of the final volume Military Operations: Italy, 1915‚Äì1919 (1949), ended thirty years' work. Edmonds was somewhat chagrined when the War Office ordered 800 copies of Assize of Arms (1946) by Brigadier-General J. H. Morgan (20 March 1876 ‚Äì 8 April 1955), that he called far more outspoken on the occupation. =France and Belgium 1917 Part II= Edmonds In the second volume of Military Operations France and Belgium, 1917 (1917 Part II) Edmonds, wrote that Haig and General Hubert Gough (12 August 1870 ‚Äì 18 March 1963) the Fifth Army commander (30 October 1916 ‚Äì 27 March 1918), were at cross purposes before and during the early part of the Third Battle of Ypres (31 July ‚Äì 10 November 1917). Edmonds described meetings between Gough and his corps commanders on at which deeper objectives than those of the GHQ 1917 plan was decided and that an extra objective was added, to be attempted at the discretion of divisional commanders. This fourth objective (red line) was beyond the range of most of the Fifth Army field artillery, so all heavy artillery was to be on call to put a defensive barrage beyond advanced posts along it. An advance to the red line was to be attempted only against weak opposition. Brigadier-General John Davidson, head of the Operations Branch at General Headquarters, questioned the Fifth Army plan in a memorandum of 26 June, recommending that the objectives be less ambitious and that the provision for an advance of to the red line be abandoned. A Fifth Army order of 27 June, summarised a meeting of Gough and the corps commanders the previous day and laid down the green line as the main objective, that required an advance of in the south, in the centre and in the north, at the junction with the French First Army (General Fran√ßois Anthoine). Patrols were to be sent forward to probe the German defences and occupy vacant ground but it was more important to avoid a ragged front line. In reply to Davidson, Gough wrote that the green line should be attempted and that opportunities to take ground up to the red line \\"without much opposition\\", should be taken. On 28 June, Haig discussed the Davidson memo at a meeting with Gough and General Plumer (commander of the Second Army on the right of the Fifth Army) and emphasised the importance of the Gheluvelt plateau. Edmonds wrote that the Fifth Army plan did not conform to Haig's requirement that the main battle would be fought for the plateau. Gough had spread the Fifth Army divisions evenly along the front, when he could have increased the size of II Corps (Lieutenant-General Claud Jacob), opposite the plateau. In a footnote, Edmonds described Fifth Army intelligence summaries in July, that stressed the strength of the German defences on the plateau, that the Germans were building more defences there than on the rest of the front and that the assembly areas of the German Eingreif divisions (specialist counter-attack divisions) were behind the plateau and the Broodseinde‚ÄìPasschendaele ridge. The summaries predicted that the Germans would try to hold the plateau, even if driven back across the Steenbeek further north. The description of the misunderstanding between Haig and Gough is contradicted by an account on the following pages, of a visit made on 27 June by Haig to the headquarters of II Corps. Jacob asked that his southern flank be extended to allow an attack on the Bassevillebeek Spur (Tower Hamlets) beyond the Bassevillebeek Stream, to deny the German army a jumping-off place, for counter-attacks against the right flank of the corps. Haig emphasised the importance of the capture of the plateau and arranged with the Fifth Army headquarters \\"at once\\", for II Corps to take command of the 24th Division (Major-General Major-General Louis Bols) to the south, that was the northernmost division of the Second Army. The Fifth Army‚ÄìSecond Army boundary was moved south on 4 July, to the road. In a footnote Edmonds described the transfer of the artillery of the 23rd Division (Major-General J. M. Babington), the 24th Division artillery, thirteen medium ( and batteries from the Second Army to II Corps. Edmonds recorded and medium guns, and medium howitzers, and , a total of pieces in the Fifth Army or \\"on the Fifth Army front\\". In footnotes, Edmonds added that II Corps had an \\"extra division\\", three heavy counter-battery and three heavy bombardment double groups; (a single group had heavy or medium batteries) while each of the three British corps to the north had two heavy counter-battery double groups and three heavy bombardment single groups. The II Corps divisions had eight or nine field artillery brigades each, rather than the six in the divisions of the other corps. II Corps had of the Fifth Army artillery and had five divisions, with being engaged on 31 July, compared to four divisions with two engaged, in each of the other corps. The green line for II Corps varied, from a depth of on the southern flank at Klein Zillibeke, to on the northern flank, along the Ypres‚ÄìRoulers railway; the green line from the southern flank of XIX Corps to the northern flank of XIV Corps required an advance of . An advance of to the red line was not fundamental to the plan and discretion to attempt it was left with the divisional commanders, based on the extent of local German resistance, which conformed to the manual SS 135. Had the German defence collapsed and the red line been reached, the German I, II and III lines would have been east of the new front line, except for of south of Broodseinde. Travers In The Killing Ground.... (1987), Tim Travers wrote that on the planning and conduct of the Battle of Pilckem Ridge (31 July ‚Äì 2 August) and the Battle of Langemarck described in 1917 Part II, the volume reflected three controversies. Travers wrote that Gough believed that Haig had ordered him to plan a breakthrough offensive, particularly at the meeting on 28 June, yet a few days later, Haig changed his mind and wanted a step-by-step attack. Travers wrote that it was illogical to give the principal command of a bite and hold attack to a \\"thruster\\" like Gough, when Plumer had a reputation for thoroughness. Travers wrote that Haig wavered in his thinking about what he wanted but left Gough under the impression that he was to plan a breakthrough attack. Travers wrote that Haig had emphasised the importance of the Gheluvelt plateau, particularly at the meeting of 28 June and that on 30 June, Haig wrote, \\"Capture the Passchendaele‚ÄìStaden Ridge\\", on his copy of the Fifth Army plan. The importance of the Gheluvelt plateau is also found in GHQ orders of 5 July and Fifth Army orders on 8 July. Travers wrote that the Fifth Army failed to give adequate emphasis to this and that a structural obstacle constrained the army, since the southern edge of the Gheluvelt plateau was inside the Second Army boundary. Travers concluded that Haig and GHQ chose the time, place and strategy of the campaign and that Gough and the Fifth Army staff decided the tactics. Travers called Wynne's first draft of 1917 Part II (1943) as \\"anti-Haig\\", the second draft (1944) as \\"anti-Gough\\" and the third draft (1945) as \\"anti-Haig and anti-Gough\\". Edmonds's fourth draft (published 1948) was \\"pro-Haig and anti-Gough\\" and Wynne declined to be named as an author. Travers wrote that Edmonds was willing to accept criticism and made amendments for interested parties, to whom drafts were circulated but became increasingly protective of Haig's reputation and noticeably autocratic towards the other historians. Travers described a leadership vacuum in the BEF caused by delegation, that was \\"scandalous\\" and that Edmonds failed to stress this. Gough had attempted a breakthrough offensive, conforming to the decisions laid down by Haig, was at fault for overlooking the importance of the Gheluvelt plateau and for ignoring a suggestion by the XIV Corps commander (Lieutenant- General Rudolph Cavan), to add weight to the attack there. Travers wrote that 1917 Part II omitted a request made by Gough in August for a conference, to discuss a remedy for the lack of weight being brought against the Gheluvelt plateau, a matter that Haig and the staff at GHQ should have settled long before the attack commenced, along with the awkward placement of the Second Army-Fifth Army boundary. In the published version of 1917 Part II, most of the blame for the decisions on the type of offensive, the width and direction of attacks and responsibility for planning was put on Gough and the Fifth Army staff, rather than on Haig and GHQ for selecting the Ypres Salient at all. Green In 2003, Green described the writing of 1917 Part II by Wynne and the circulation of the first draft to participants. Gough found the first draft highly objectionable and since so many other participants in the battle had died, his views were given considerable attention by Edmonds, during Wynne's absence on war work in 1943. Gough held that the draft exaggerated his intention to break through the German defences at Ypres. Gough described the meeting of 28 June 1917 by Haig, Gough and Plumer, as evidence of Haig's understanding and acceptance of the Fifth Army plan. Gough noted that General Headquarters had caused a road to be built and kept clear for the use of cavalry and that Haig had rejected Rawlinson's and Plumer's plans as too limited. Gough stressed that his plan was not limited by specific objectives, which had hampered attacks at Loos and Gallipoli in 1915 and the Somme in 1916. Wynne had referred to the Davidson memo of 26 June but Gough pointed out that reserves were available close by, to exploit advantages that emerged, rather than the first attacking troops were to advance indefinitely. Green wrote that Edmonds told Wynne to include the points made by Gough but that Wynne objected, because Davidson had related how Haig revised his views after a 25 June meeting with the Cabinet in London and wrote \\"wear down the enemy but have an objective\\" on the Fifth Army plan. Wynne claimed that Gough had misunderstood Haig's intentions and that was the source of Gough's objections to the draft; Edmonds supported Wynne but later changed his mind. Green wrote that Haig had intended Gough to conduct a breakthrough attempt and that Edmonds had included this in the draft, as well as describing the changes in Haig's outlook during 1917, as the prospect of significant French support varied. Gough had added the red line to meet Haig's requirements but overlooked the importance of the Gheluvelt plateau, spreading his forces equally across the attack front. Green noted that Prior and Wilson had found this in their 1998 study and that in 2001 Simpson noted Prior and Wilson's emphasis on artillery and lack of analysis of infantry operations. Green also wrote that Edmonds referred to the continuity of Haig's optimism about the possibility of a deep advance on 4 August, 21 September and in early October, long after the likelihood had ended. Edmonds changed the draft in Gough's favour, by showing that the weather in August was unusually wet, with extracts from a French study Le Climat de La France (Bigourdan) that contradicted the 1929 of Haig's Chief Intelligence Officer Brigadier-General J. Charteris (1915‚Äì1918). Edmonds wrote that the worst of the weather was from yet vividly described the wet and muddy conditions in August and their morale-sapping effect on British troops. Wynne had written extensively on the difficulties of the French Army after the Nivelle offensive and its effect on British strategy but Edmonds cut much of this. Edmonds left much of the remainder of Wynne's draft, despite Gough's objection that it implied that Haig had abrogated his authority, by delegating so much to Gough and not imposing changes, to allay his doubts about the Fifth Army plan for the Gheluvelt plateau. Edmonds noted the persistence with which Haig pursued objectives and that he advocated attacks regardless of their geographical progress, to keep pressure on the German army. Green related an estrangement between Wynne and Edmonds, over Edmonds' willingness to accept Gough's objections. Edmonds sent Wynne to meet Gough, which led to a substantial change in Wynne's point of view. Wynne revised the draft to remove much of the blame from Gough, writing that Haig bore principal responsibility for the Fifth Army plan in the third (1945) draft. Edmonds then found this draft objectionable and quarrelled with Wynne, who declined to be named as an author. Green wrote that Edmonds and Wynne had changed their views about Gough and made the narrative of his role in the events of 1917 much more accurate, it being noticeably less defensive of Haig. Wynne's conclusion had been that the strategy of retaining the initiative to protect the French Army had worked and that the tactical intention to clear the Belgian coast had failed, due to an underestimation of German resilience and the mistaken attempt at a breakthrough. Earlier plans had been for short steps and an emphasis on the Gheluvelt plateau. Haig was responsible for accepting Gough's plan for 31 July, despite his cautious reminder to Gough on 6 July, giving the Passchendaele‚ÄìStaden Ridge and the Belgian coast as geographical objectives. Wynne removed these details from his draft but concluded that the GHQ 1917 plan might have been as successful as the Battle of Messines (7‚Äì14 June). Edmonds had also accepted the logic of an offensive in Flanders but not that of appointing Gough; if Haig had wanted a cautious attack he was wrong to have superseded Plumer. Green showed that Edmonds acknowledged the constraints affecting Haig but that he had wanted a breakthrough attack, chose Gough who known as a \\"thruster\\" and encouraged his optimism; Haig had kept any misgivings to himself. Green referred to Travers and wrote that he had taken the same view as Edmonds, on the questions of the intended breakthrough and the importance of the Gheluvelt plateau. Edmonds had written that Haig had accepted Gough's wishes and Green wrote that this did not mean that Gough was aware of Haig's doubts. Edmonds thought that Haig wanted a decisive success and the capture of distant objectives on the first day, despite doubts that he withheld. Travers had written that the Edmonds draft was wrong, yet had formed the same conclusions as Edmonds. Travers had criticised the published draft, for failing to record that Haig had not resolved disagreements and problems among his subordinates, long before the offensive began; Green wrote that Edmonds had made the same criticism. Green wrote that judging the drafts of the volume \\"pro-\\" or \\"anti-\\" Haig or Gough was facile and led to inconsistent conclusions. If the published draft was \\"anti-\\" Gough that it was surprising that he had called it a great improvement. Green compared the volume with later studies and wrote that the narrative did not support an explanation of the delay from being caused by a need to divert the Germans from the French army. On 7 May, Haig had decided to begin the Messines operation in early June but he had not been informed until 2 June of the state of the French army. Edmonds had written that the attack on Messines Ridge began on 7 June, because of the difficulty of mounting three simultaneous attacks at Ypres. Edmonds ascribed the apparent delay from to Haig's decision to give principal responsibility to Gough. Wynne had claimed that Edmonds failed to reveal the superiority of German tactics but in 1998, Prior and Wilson had shown that British tactics had evolved in 1917, although their application was inconsistent. Edmonds had demonstrated that the attack on Messines ridge was a cautious advance for . The plan incorporated progressive elements like those used at Arras on 9 April, particularly emphases on counter-battery fire and a carefully controlled creeping barrage. The Second Army had and howitzers, that fired of ammunition, times more than that available for the First Day on the Somme (1 July 1916), to counter the deep German defence zones and Eingreif divisions. Strongpoints were destroyed, wire was cut and German artillery suppressed. Three layers of creeping barrage deep preceded the infantry, who had been trained in the pillbox fighting methods used at Vimy Ridge. The infantry were followed by mopping-up parties, who captured by-passed German positions. Use of such techniques had been possible, because the artillery had become more accurate. The gunners also had more ammunition to use and had been able to suppress German defences as the British advanced; objectives had been limited to the range of the artillery and had led to a great victory. Prior and Wilson wrote that these methods were not used on 31 July, because Haig had over-ruled Rawlinson, Plumer and Davidson; Gough over-reached and left the British infantry vulnerable to German counter-attacks. Edmonds had written that on 31 July, excessive demands had been placed on the artillery, that had spread its fire too thin. Green wrote that at the end of August, Haig had turned to Plumer and bite-and-hold methods, that Edmonds called this a radical revision. The greatest weight of artillery-fire possible was to be massed against the Gheluvelt plateau, for a succession of strictly limited attacks. Plumer planned four steps at six-day intervals, to give time to move artillery and supplies forward. The steps were limited to a depth of and a large increase in medium and heavy artillery was to be used to smash pillboxes and to add to the counter-battery effort. The Battle of the Menin Road Ridge (20‚Äì26 September) had double the number of guns on half the depth of attack, making four times the weight of shell compared to 31 July. Infantry tactics also emphasised systematic consolidation of all captured ground and strongpoints. With the new battle drill and unprecedented artillery support, the attack was a great success. Green noted that Prior and Wilson described Menin road as a triumph of reduced expectations and that Passchendaele Ridge was still away. Haig had then insisted on preparations for a breakthrough after the successes of the Battle of Polygon Wood (26‚Äì27 September) and the Battle of Broodseinde (4 October) but inadequate artillery preparation led to the failures at the Battle of Poelcappelle (9 October) and the First Battle of Passchendaele (12 October). Green concluded that the publication of 1917 Part II in 1948 had much to awaken controversy, particularly the contrast between flawed tactics and the methods used with success earlier in 1917. Green wrote that the volume mostly accorded with modern writing and contained little bias regarding Haig. Edmonds had referred to the external constraints of lack of manpower and the state of the French Army, yet his narrative had made the military errors manifest; Haig's desire for a breakthrough had led to a failure to relate strategy to tactics. Haig had failed to communicate with Plumer and Gough and had prolonged the offensive beyond the period of good weather that ended in early October. Green concluded that Edmonds had produced a work of lasting authority, in a series of substantial historical, military and literary value. Green wrote that later scholars who have accused Edmonds of bias, have had to acknowledge that his assessments and conclusions are largely accurate.

Separated from its nearest neighbors (Pico and Faial islands) by the Pico-S√£o Jorge Channel, the central group is often referred colloquially as part of the Triangulo (\\"Triangle\\") group or just \\"The Triangle\\". S√£o Jorge is a relatively long thin island with tall cliffs, whose 9500 inhabitants are concentrated on various geological debris fields (faj√£s) along the north and south coasts; from east to west, the island is long and, north to south, wide: its area is .  History  One of the earliest churches on the island of S√£o Jorge, the Matriz Church of Nossa Senhora do Ros√°rio, in Topo It is unclear when the first explorers discovered the island of S√£o Jorge; as part of the politics of human occupation, the Azores were populated after 1430 (probably 1439) through the initiative of Prince Henry the Navigator. 23 April, known as the feast day of Saint George, has been cited by historians as the reason for the island's name, although this is likely conjecture. Genovese and Catalan maps of the 14th century originally designated the long, slender island \\"S√£o Jorge\\", a designation that was maintained by Infante D. Henrique when settlers from northern Europe began to colonize the island (around 1460, or twenty years after it was first sighted). Although unclear, Azorean chroniclers believe that settlement on the island concentrated around the two communities of Velas and Calheta, and developed into the interior. It was in 1460 that the construction of the first church dedicated to S√£o Jorge occurred in the area of Velas, from the testaments of Infante D. Henrique. What is certain is that the island was populated by the time that Jo√£o Vaz Corte Real, the Donatary-Captain of Angra do Hero√≠smo (Terceira) obtained the captaincy of the island, by contract on 4 May 1483. By 1500, the settlement of Velas was elevated from villa to municipality (giving rise to the supposition that Velas was the first center on the island). By 1659, the parochial church had already undergone public restoration, that gave origin the present church in that municipality. After an unsuccessful adventure to the island of Flores, the Flemish nobleman Willem van der Haegen (later known as Guilherme da Silveira) moved to the area of Topo where he established and founded a local community, in 1480. After living there for several years he died and was buried in the chapel of the Casa dos Tiagos. Topo was eventually elevated to capital of the municipality by 1510, but lost this title to Calheta on June 3, 1534. During this period, the island was wild and many of the roads difficult or non-existent between the communities, resulting in isolated villages located along the coast. Connections between these communities developed by sea, and the better provisioned ports were likely to develop economically. This was the case with Calheta, Urzelina and Velas; the sites, although farther from the Terceira (the towns are located on the opposite coast), were preferred way-points due to secure and sheltered ports, with good anchorage and providing many goods and services. The growth of the population was rapid, and by the mid-17th century, S√£o Jorge had approximately 3000 inhabitants and three towns: Velas, Topo and Calheta. The island demonstrated a strong economic vitality: in addition to wine, corn, and yam, it was also an important exporter of woad to Flanders and other countries in Europe. The dynastic crisis (1580) caused by the ascension of King Philip II of Spain (King Philip I of Portugal) had consequences on the island, since gentry supported (along with those on Terceira) the pretender to the throne, D. Ant√≥nio, Prior of Crato. King D. Ant√≥nio reigned on the continent for about twenty days, until he was defeated at the Battle of Alc√¢ntra, whereupon he moved his court to Terceira Island and governed in opposition until 1583. The Habsburg-supported King Phillip finally defeated his forces at sea at the Battle of Ponta Delgada between July 25‚Äì26, 1582, and the garrisons in S√£o Jorge only capitulated to the forces of Castillo after the fall of Terceira in 1583. Following 1583, the island experienced a period of relative isolation, partially due to the poor quality of its ports and its limited economic importance. After the Spanish occupation, it was largely abandoned and its inhabitants were left to survive a meager existence. The island did not escape Atlantic piracy: the islanders were subject to attacks by English and French privateers in 1589 and 1590, raiders after 1590 (from the Barbary coast and lands occupied by the Turks) and during the 17th and 18th centuries (mostly around Calheta). In 1625, the inhabitants of Faj√£ de S√£o Jo√£o were captured by pirates and likely sold into slavery. The tranquillity around the island was also broken on September 20, 1708, when the town of Velas was attacked by French pirates under the command of Ren√© Duguay-Trouin. The population of the community resisted for twenty- four hours, but eventually the pirates made shore where they disembarked. The resistance, commanded by Sergeant-major Amaro Soares de Sousa, occurred around the village of Banquetas saving the other villages from occupation and pillaging. Periods of local prosperity or misery occurred in the following years; there were several bad growing seasons and natural catastrophes (such as the earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tornados in 1580, 1757, 1808 and 1899) that created famines and hardships. The most famous of these eruptions began in the early morning of May 1, 1808 (Urzelina eruption). Suffocating gases, as well as carboxylic acid, were emitted from a vent along the Manadas ridge and thick greenish vaporous clouds (of chloric and sulfuric acids) rapidly spread to the plants. Eight major tremors were recorded per hour that caused widespread panic. Many of the homes, buildings and cultivatable lands were destroyed. Between 1580 and 1907, at least six significant eruptions occurred; ten people were killed during the 1580 eruption and eight in 1808. In 1850, the island's vineyards were devastated by the phylloxera plague, which had a terrible effect on the economy until the development of the orange industry (about 1860). The island's isolation ended after the completion of the ports of Velas and Calheta. During the Portuguese Civil War, Liberalist forces were stationed on the island after May 10, 1831. Generally, the island's residents have lived for many years in isolation, interrupted by rare visits from the authorities, commercial boats from the local islands, and the occasional nobleman who has come to contemplate the local scenery. With the inauguration of its ports, and the airport/aerodrome (April 23, 1982) commercial ventures have grown (especially the export of the local cheese), the expansion of animal husbandry, the fisheries and a small crafts industry.  Geography  = Physical geography = The southern coast of S√£o Jorge, with its rugged cliffs along the southeastern part of Calheta Unique among the islands of Azores, S√£o Jorge is uncharacteristically long and slender and susceptible to ocean erosion. The island was built on fissural volcanism associated with the plate tectonics of the mid-Atlantic Ridge and a transform fault that extends from the Ridge to the island of S√£o Miguel (referred to as the S√£o Jorge Fault). Through successive fissural eruptions the island was built-up: the only remnants of these forces are the line of volcanic cones that extend along the central ridge (approximately 700 metres in altitude). The island was built-up from successive morphological structures of progressively younger materials, these include: * Topo Volcanic Complex - predominantly built of basalt, hawaiite, and mugearite lavas and pyroclastic deposits and Strombolian cinder cones. Materials in this formation were produced are about 600,000 years in age. * Rosais Volcanic Complex - consisting of the northeastern portion of the island, with a similar composition to those materials in Topo. * Manadas Volcanic Complex - most recent formation composed of Strombolian cones and two Surtseyan cones (Morro de Lemos and Morro Velho), as well as craters and tuff rings resulting from Phreatomagmatic activity. The island is 55 km in length from the Ponta dos Rosais until the Topo Islet and a maximum width between Faj√£ das Pontas and Portinho da Calheta (approximately 7 km). The highest point is Pico da Esperan√ßa at 1,053 meters. The island has an area of 246 km2, with an obvious difference in the relief between the western and eastern portions of the island: the western coast is ringed with cliffs, while the eastern coast is morphologically smoother. Similarly, the contrast between the northern and southern coasts are obvious; apart from several deltas (faj√£s) on both coasts, the northern coast has sharp cliffs, while the southern coast is less inclined. The majority of the cliffs in the northeast are between 300 and 400 m with severe slopes (between 45¬∞ and 55¬∞). In this area, many of the faj√£s, some composed of lavas (Faj√£ do Ouvidor, Faj√£ das Pontas and Faj√£ da Ribeira da Areia) and others dendritic (Faj√£ de Jo√£o Dias and Faj√£ da Penedia), are visible. In the southwest the cliffs are approximately 100m in height and most settlements are located along the lava deltas, such as the Faj√£ das Velas, Faj√£ da Queimada, Faj√£ Grande and Faj√£ da Calheta. = Climate = Being located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, in an area of high pressures the island benefits from the influence of the Gulf Stream that maintains water temperatures between 17 and 23 ¬∞C, and atmospheric temperatures hovering between 13 and 24 ¬∞C. Annual humidity hovers around 75% and the level of precipitation has molded the physical appearance of the island. = Human geography = Faj√£ de S√£o Jo√£o Faj√£ de Santo Cristo The geomorphology of the island (its high cliffs, rough central plateaus and scattered faj√£s) resulted in the concentration of human settlements along the coast. Historically these communities were linked by coastal ports since the trails in the interior were barely transitable. Consequently, communities were isolated from one another necessitating local solutions to common problems and building local ties between families. Velas, Calheta and Topo developed partially due to well developed ports and local economies, in addition to administrative necessity and central positions. The settlements developed with immigration from Spain and Flanders, principally by settlers brought by the √Åvilas and by Willem van de Hagen. Administratively, S√£o Jorge is divided into two municipalities: Calheta in the east with five parishes and Velas in the west with six parishes. The rural population is basically aligned along the lines of communication divided by areas of unpopulated pastureland between localities.  Economy  After a period of small subsistence agriculture, the local economy began to concentrate on a few chief exports: initially, lichen (Roccella tinctoria) and woad (Isatis tinctoria), later the introduction of wheat and corn crops. Woad was one of the most important exports from S√£o Jorge and the Azores; it was initially introduced by Willem van der Hagen around 1490, and exported primarily to his countrymen in Flanders. Both woad and lichen were very popular in central Europe as a dye. These exports were later superseded by grapes and wine after 1571 and endured for the next three centuries. It was first disseminated along the southern coast, owing to the fertile soils, and adapted well to many of the faj√£s of Calheta (including Faj√£ dos Vimes, Faj√£ de S√£o Jo√£o, Faj√£ do Ouvidor, and Faj√£ Grande), as well as the areas between Ribeira do Almeirda and the parish of Queimadas (in Velas). These were generally considered lands that were not adequate for cereal cultivation, but where vineyards flourished. The majority of the wine production was located in the area between Queimada, Urzelina and Manadas, with grapes of the Verdelho and Terrantez castes, as well as some Bastardo, Moscatel and Alicante produced in an area that became lucrative and highly prized. Unlike the other islands, where grape vines grew on the rocky hedge- rows or around protective volcanic rocks, the grapes of S√£o Jorge were grown between many of the natural species of bush and trees. Over the centuries many barrels of wine were produced in this method, and about 10,000 barrels were regularly exported or consumed locally. S√£o Jorge wines were so highly esteemed that the Count of Almada, then Captain General of the Azores, created the \\"S√£o Jorge\\" brand in order to mitigate fraudulent sales. The wine was also appreciated during the World Exposition of 1867 (in Paris, France) where it rivaled Porto wine. Unfortunately, the Oidium tukeri grape/vine disease reached the island in late 1854 and destroyed the prosperous industry. Various attempts were made to restart the wine industry, such as Francisco Jos√© de Bettencourt e √Åvila, the Baron Ribeiro in the area of Urzelina, and later Miguel Teixeira Soares de Sousa and Marta Pereira da Silveira, who produced wine from the Izabela caste. Meanwhile, the phylloxera disease continued to destroy many of the vineyards in the municipality of Calheta during the second half of the 18th Century, and throughout the island the disease would bring many producers to bankruptcy. The remnants of the viticulture of the island banded together around Casteletes, in Urzelina, which include Jo√£o In√°cio de Bettencourt Noronha, producing a new caste of wines around Urzelina and Faj√£ de S√£o Jo√£o. Orange cultivation spread in the Azores around the 17th Century owing to the environmental conditions and the fertility of the lands. The export of oranges to the United Kingdom and North America was an important phase in the island's economy; about six shipments per port were annually exported, which included about 7 million (or about 994,000 kilograms) oranges. Orange orchards were located primarily in the communities of Santo Amaro, Urzelina, Ribeira Seca and in Faj√£ de S√£o Jo√£os. Another crop to form a part of the culture of the Azores is the yam. It is widely popular and cultivated in any plot of land, and was used as an important subsistence food during the island's formative years although never becoming a major export product. It was so important that it was included in the Coat-of-Arms of Calheta, since 1694. Long before whale-watching became important, whaling was an important industry between the end of the 19th century and middle of the 20th century, where a majority of the inhabitants were tied exclusively to this economy. In strategic locations along the coast, small huts were built to watch-out for whales and give an alarm to the local hunters, who would sail out and harpoon the mammals. Later, when this hunt was prohibited, the islanders began to \\"hunt\\" Albacor and Bonito Tuna resulting in the creation of two processing plants in Calheta. Fishing continues to be an important part of the local economy, although whale-watching has turned into a part of local tourism. While cereals, vineyards and local vegetables are still grown sporadically around the island (much like the other islands of the Azores) the economy of S√£o Jorge is currently dependent on the dairy industry. The local S√£o Jorge cheese has been the most important part of the local economy, resulting in the establishment of an order, the Confraria do Queijo de S√£o Jorge, to promote the consumption and sale of this popular cheese. In addition, Uniqueijo Uni√£o de Cooperativeas Agr√≠colas de Lactic√≠nios de S√£o Jorge (Cooperative Agricultural Union of S√£o Jorge Dairy Producers) is the principal dairy- producer on the island. A union of eight cooperatives, Uniqueijo is dedicated to the commercialization of the traditional S√£o Jorge cheese, including new products classified under the DOP Denomina√ß√£o de Origem Protegida (Denomination of Protected Origin) status. Culture, tradition and tourism Topo, used in annual festivals to celebrate the Holy Spirit =Festivities= The principal festivals popular on the island are not dissimilar to those celebrated on the islands of the archipelago. There are the festivals of Esp√≠rito Santo that concentrate on the many imp√©rios around the island, and are an important manifestation of the religious character of the islands. These festivals occur every Sunday during the seven weeks after Easter, and culminate on the seventh Sunday, Pentecosts, although some traditions vary from place-to-place. Generally, there are processions to the church and masses associated with this festival, but also include alms for the poor, the serving of a meat-soup-like broth (whose methods of preparation and serving vary from community to community) and gathering of the local citizens for conversation and/or dancing. Velas' Semana Cultural (Culture Week) is also another festivity that mixes local traditions and cultural influences from abroad. During this week expositions and presentations of local Azorean culture are mixed with local concerts, bullfights, and finally a regata between Velas and Horta, Faial during the first week of July. Meanwhile, in the village of Calheta the Festival de Julho (the July Festival) highlights four days of festivities that brings together ethnic processions, musical comedies, theatrical presentations and local sports competitions. The Romarias (religious pilgrimages) are a tradition of the island's Catholic communities, and strongly linked to catastrophes associated with historical earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The Romaria de Nossa Senhora de Carmo, which occurs annually in the Faj√£ dos Vimes (July 16), and the Romaria do Santo Cristo in the Faj√£ da Caldeira de Santo Cristo, are popular processions where many faithful walk between religious sanctuaries, praying and in contemplation, usually stopping for mass at local churches. =Tradition= The local gastronomy includes many Azorean basics, but includes local plates of fish and pork with an abundance of spices, typical of the communities visited by far eastern caravels during the Age of Exploration. Clam dishes are fairly unusual to S√£o Jorge, being the only location in the archipelago where clams are discovered (usually in the Faj√£ da Caldeira de Santo Cristo). Generally there is an abundance of locals sweets for local tourists, including: coscor√µes, roquilhas de aguardente, esp√©cies, suspiros, olvidados, bolos de v√©spera, cavacos, queijadas de leite, and a√ßucareura branca. In addition, the traditional corn-bread (made from white or yellow cornmeal) is still very popular, since wheat-based breads were generally for the privileged classes of the island. The Azorean yam was also an important base of the local diet, as well as an export product.

It adjoins Cheshire to the north west, Derbyshire and Leicestershire to the east, Warwickshire to the south east, West Midlands and Worcestershire to the south, and Shropshire to the west. The historic county of Staffordshire included Wolverhampton, Walsall, and West Bromwich, these three being removed in 1974 to the new county of West Midlands. The resulting administrative area of Staffordshire has a narrow southwards protrusion that runs west of West Midlands to the border of Worcestershire. The city of Stoke- on-Trent was removed in the 1990s to form a unitary authority, but is still considered part of Staffordshire for ceremonial purposes. The historic county had an area of 781,000 acres (1,250 sq. miles) and at the first census in 1801 had a population of 239,153.History, Gazetteer and Directory of Staffordshire; by William White, pub. Sheffield, 1834 The county probably first came into being in this form in the decade after the year 913; that being the date at which Stafford ‚Äì the strategic military fording-point for an army to cross the Trent ‚Äì became a secure fortified stronghold and the new capital of Mercia under Queen √Üthelfl√¶d. Historically, Staffordshire was divided into the five hundreds. The origin of the hundred dates from the division of his kingdom by King Alfred the Great into counties, hundreds and tithings. From the beginning, Staffordshire was divided into the hundreds of Totmonslow, Pirehill, Offlow, Cuttleston and Seisdon.A Topographical History of Staffordshire; by William Pitt, pub. J. Smith (Newcastle-under-Lyme), 1817; page 13 Hundreds of Staffordshire The hundredal division of Staffordshire differs markedly from that of the counties to the south and west in showing far greater stability. All the Domesday hundreds are kept practically unchanged down to modern times. Also in the size of the hundreds. The Staffordshire hundreds, five in number, are on the whole far larger than any in the adjacent counties; more especially as regards northern Staffordshire. The two hundreds in the south-west are of more normal extent. It seems to be due chiefly to the nature of the county. Northern Staffordshire is to a large extent moorland, which must have been unattractive to early settlers. It is noteworthy, as showing where the centres of these hundreds lay, that the meeting-places of the two northern hundreds (Pirehill and Totmonslow) are in the extreme south of the respective hundreds. Southern Staffordshire was largely a forest-district. The southern part of Seisdon hundred was covered by Kinver Forest, and large parts of the two hundreds in the central part of the county, those of Cuttleston and Offlow, must have been occupied by Cannock Forest. The cultivated areas of these hundreds must in early days have been considerably smaller than at present.The English Hundred Names, by Olof Anderson, Lund (Sweden), 1934. Page 144 The county symbol, the Staffordshire Knot, is seen on an Anglian stone cross that dates from around the year 805. The cross still stands in Stoke churchyard. Thus the Knot is either i) an ancient Mercian symbol or ii) a symbol adopted from the Irish Christianity, Christianity having been brought to Staffordshire by Irish monks from Lindisfarne about AD 650.

The municipality of Calheta, whose first settlers arrived around the 1480s (principally in the area of Topo, but later into the sheltered coves and faj√£s) along the southern coast of the island). The island of S√£o Jorge was ceded to Jo√£o Vaz Corte-Real on 4 May 1483, becoming the first Captain-Donatario, thus initiating the primary settlement of the island. This phase of development is notable for the settlement of Willem van der Haegen, a Flemish pioneer of Azorean colonization who traveled and settled in Faial, Corvo and Terceira). His final resting place was in the settlement of Topo, which he founded with other Flemish settlers; he died in 1500, and was buried in the chapel-annex to the Solar dos Tiagos. Topo was later elevated to municipality and its village the municipal seat, on 12 September 1510. Calheta was elevated to the status of town on 3 June 1534 by regal decree, issued by King D. John III. Meanwhile, other settlements developed rapidly due to a number of sheltered anchorages and the fertility of the small faj√£s where colonists established homes. Faj√£ de S√£o Jo√£o, one of this settlements along the southern coast, had settlers as early as 1550 (this is conjecture established from the Chapel of S√£o Jo√£o. In Topo, the community established a port in order to establish trade with Terceira (at that time the largest municipal and commercial center in the Azores). Other settlements radiated from the coastal beachheads and the growth of the number of colonists justified the de-annexation of the parish of Calheta from the municipality of Velas. Demonstrating an economic vitality (based on its vineyards, cereal crops, yams and the exploration of lichen roccella which was being exported to Flanders for use in the dye industry), it was elevated to the status of on 3 June 1534, by decree of King John III of Portugal.Arquivo dos A√ßores, Vol. V, p√°g. 141 Other calamities have affected the early inhabitants: several dry seasons, numerous earthquakes and volcanic eruptions (1580‚Äì1757, 1808 and 1980), and on 21 July 1694 there occurred another tragic conflict that would later be known as the Motim dos Inhames (The Taro Revolt). It was a peasant uprising against an imposed tax or tithe on taro production. Taro was a staple of the peasant class, and tax on these tuberculosis generated a large revenue for the administrative government. After three years of leniency, in 1692, Francisco Lopes Beir√£o (the local sheriff) ordered his agents to pressure the locals to pay their \\"tax\\". This created tensions between the political and peasants classes, exploding into hostility in the community of Ribeira da Areia between citizens in the northern half of Calheta and tax-collectors from the village of Velas. Although this conflict was settled by the local vicar, Francisco Lopes Beir√£o petitioned the King, and he sent Jo√£o de Soveral e Barbuda to S√£o Jorge to determine and imprison the responsible parties. In the end many peasants, their supporters from the Council in Calheta and residents of Topo were interrogated, imprisoned and required to pay outstanding taxes. Many became penniless, died of famine, or were imprisoned in the Castle of S√£o Jo√£o Baptista, the prison in Angra do Hero√≠smo or the jail across the Canal in Horta. Future Calhetenses would use the leaves of the taro on their rifles in honour of the events. The parochial Church of Santa Catarina was constructed following a fire that destroyed the original chapel (8 January 1639), that dated back to the early 16th century. As a convent was ordered constructed, on 12 May 1718, the church was also remodeled. The Calhetense settlers did not escape the attacks and destruction caused by pirates in the waters of the archipelago. English and French privateers, in addition to Turkish and Algerian (Barbary Coast) pirates in the Canal between Pico and S√£o Jorge, persisted during the 16-17th Centuries. In 1597, a section of the squadron commanded by the Count of Essex, attacked the village of Calheta. To repel the invaders, the inhabitants, hurled rocks (their only defense) from the cliffs at the English privateers attempting to reach the shore. During the battle, one Portuguese soldier, Sim√£o Gote was able to rob the ensign of their flag, and escape with it victoriously. In the 18th century, the French corsair Ren√© Duguay-Trouin pillaged the settlements in S√£o Jorge, and in 1816 an Algerian pirate, while attempting to hunt and capture a merchant clipper was shelled by the cannons in the local fort in Calheta. The sheltered cove was elaborated in 1755, and a lighthouse constructed in 1873 to improve navigation and shipping. In addition to the parochial church, the Church of Santo Ant√≥nio was completed in 1816, along the Rua de Baixo which connects Calheta and Ribeira Seca. The village was destroyed by the 9 July 1757 earthquake, which became known as Mandado de Deus (Sent by God); the earthquake (which was located off the northern coast of Calheta) was responsible for the complete destruction of the homes in the municipality and the death of 1200 people on the island. The local philharmonic band was one of the earliest organizations to develop, and dates back to 1868. A water network was completed in the principal urbanized area around 1878, with the completion of the local fountain. Geography the same name The five parishes of Calheta are: * Calheta * Norte Pequeno * Ribeira Seca * Santo Ant√£o * Topo - it was the first municipality established on the island of S√£o Jorge (currently fewer than 500 inhabitants), pioneered by a group of Flemish settlers, captained by Willem van der Haegen. Economy The base of economic activities in the region are cattle-raising, agriculture and the processing of fish. Two tuna-processing factories exist in this municipalities: one in Faj√£ Grande and the other in proximity to the port of Calheta. Due to overfishing, activities in these factories have been suspended. Consequently, plans to convert the factory into a tourist hotel have progressed for the factory in Calheta. Yet, it is the collection and transformation of milk to produce the famous Queijo de S√£o Jorge that drives local activities. Similarly, the Port of Calheta used to be a center for the construction of trans-Atlantic ships, but has since been used for local fishing and trans-shipment services. As the central place in the southern eastern part of the island, the area includes various banks, commercial establishments, as well as the location of the Volunteer Fire Department and the home of the island's Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia (home and support for the elderly). Over time, the influx of tourists has helped to transform the communities of the municipality, primarily due to the geological predominance of the faj√£s in the region and the relatively unspoilt natural conditions in the interior. This has had the corollary effect of expanding the production and sale of local handicraft and traditional artisanal pastries/cookies.

For many years, the Jorgense culture has been recognized in the local region for its musical abilities. The number of philharmonic bands at one time was greater than the number of civil parishes. Musical interest also extended to the traditional dances, where many played or danced to a folkloric style that included Chamarrita, Saudade, Samacaio, P√©zinho, Lira, and P√™ssegos. Many of the ethnographic groups that were formed in the 20th century were an attempt to protect and maintain these traditional dance forms and melodies, in addition to the typically rural dress associated a bygone age. Of note, the Grupo Etnogr√°fico da Calheta (Ethnographic Group of Calheta) was recognized for its research and investigations into traditional music and dress. Notable citizens * Francisco Lacerda (Riberia Seca, 11 May 1869 ‚Äî Lisbon, 18 July 1934) composer, musicologist and folklorist, was considered one of the best musical directors in 19th century Europe.

Historically, bounded to the north-west by Staffordshire, by Leicestershire to the north-east, Northamptonshire to the east, Worcestershire to the west, Oxfordshire to the south and Gloucestershire to the south-west. Areas historically part of Warwickshire include Coventry, Solihull, Sutton Coldfield and a small area of central Birmingham including Aston and Edgbaston. These became part of the metropolitan county of West Midlands (Sutton Coldfield becoming part of Birmingham) following local government re-organisation in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972.HMSO. Local Government Act 1972. 1972 c.70 Much of northwestern Warwickshire, including that area now forming part of Coventry, Solihull and Birmingham, was covered by the ancient Forest of Arden which was still the case at the time of the Domesday Book but much of which was later cut down to provide fuel for industrialisation. Thus the names of a number of places in the northwestern part of Warwickshire end with either the Old English \\"ley\\" or \\"leah\\" meaning a clearing in a forest or latterly the phrase \\"-in-Arden\\", such as Henley-in-Arden, Hampton-in-Arden and Tanworth-in- Arden.

Tom Burgess, 1876 Historically, two towns dominate the county, Warwick, the county town and Coventry an important medieval city. Prehistoric The Warwickshire area has almost certainly been inhabited since Prehistoric times, with the arrival of the first people half a million years ago during the Paleolithic or Old Stone Age. Small family groups roamed the thickly wooded landscape in search of food using simple stone tools such as hand-axes and scrapers. The total population of the area in those days may have been as low as 40. There is evidence of a temporary camp site at Waverley Wood Farm Pit, near Leamington Spa, whilst elsewhere, particularly in north Warwickshire, large numbers of hand-axes have been found suggesting repeated visits. This early phase came to an end with the onset of the Ice Age during which there is no evidence of a human presence in Warwickshire.Archaeology in Warwickshire, The Old Stone Age Human groups returned to the area around 10,500 years ago at the beginning of the Mesolithic period or Middle Stone Age. As the climate became warmer and the ice sheets retreated, the habitat changed and the forest was re-established. These people were hunter-gatherers who used bows and arrows and had domesticated dogs to help them in the chase. This period is characterised by the use of microliths, small delicately worked points set into arrowshafts. Other flint tools were used for working wood and bone and for cleaning skins. Some 20 sites are known in Warwickshire of which the most important is Blacklow Hill, near Warwick. Excavations here have revealed a substantial tool-making site. Other sites are known in the Avon valley and intensive fieldwork around Nuneaton has produced a large number of finds and evidence of several settlement sites.Archaeology in Warwickshire, The Middle Stone Age Around 6,000 years ago the hunter-gatherer way of life was gradually being replaced by a simple farming economy, thus further modifying their habitat. These Neolithic or New Stone Age people raised sheep, pigs and cattle, and grew cereal crops. They used fire and stone axes to make clearings in the woodland where they could build farms and lay out fields. A flint arrowhead from this period has been recovered from Wolston. The Bronze Age was a time of change, the scattered farming communities were coming together into tribal groups with powerful leaders. Metal was now in use and objects were being made out of copper and bronze. There are a number of weapons such as swords and spearheads cast in bronze found in Warwickshire. There is also evidence of people taking care of their appearance, two bronze razors have been recorded recently in South Warwickshire. Warwickshire being a rich agricultural area farming continued to expand and by 1500 BC much of the woodland had been cleared and settled.Archaeology in Warwickshire, The Bronze Age In the Iron Age, the area contained small farmsteads such as the settlement at Wasperton, near Warwick. The main building was a thatched round house where the family and some of the livestock lived and around it workshops, storehouses and stock pens. The whole settlement was surrounded by a deep ditch which kept out wild animals. During times of trouble the population may have taken refuge in one of a number of hillforts such as Meon Hill near Stratford or Oldbury near Nuneaton.Archaeology in Warwickshire, The Iron Age The remains of around twelve Iron Age hill forts have been found in the Warwickshire area. Roman period The reconstructed Roman Lunt Fort in Baginton near Coventry. For the first few decades following the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43, the Warwickshire area found itself at the frontier of Roman rule. The Watling Street and Fosse Way Roman roads were constructed, the Fosse Way marking the western frontier of Roman rule in Britain for several decades. The area was heavily fortified during this period and several military settlements were founded to defend the roads. Ryknild Street was constructed across the Warwickshire area and a fort was established in what is now the grounds of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. The fort was built in about 48 AD by the Roman army as a base camp for its conquest of the Birmingham areaVictor Skipp, The History of Greater Birmingham - down to 1830, 1980. and part of a network of forts across the Midlands linked by roads.Birmingham's Roman Fort Main Findings It stood by Birmingham's earliest known road junction at the point where Icknield Street was met by Roman roads coming in from Droitwich and Penkridge. From here the road runs north to another fort over the county border into Staffordshire at Wall, Roman Etocetum near Lichfield. Following the revolt in AD60/1 of the Iceni under their Queen Boudica most scholars have assumed that, after the burning of Colchester and London, Boudica followed Suetonius up Watling Street as he headed for his supply bases and lines of communication near to the milItary frontier.Michael Wood, In Search of the Dark Ages, BBC Books 2005 Suetonius offered battle in a strong defensive position described by Tacitus and many fruitless attempts have been made to be more precise regarding the site of the Battle of Watling Street, the last battle of Boudica. The historian, Dr Graham Webster has suggested it took place near Manduessedum (\\"the place of the war chariots\\"),A Dictionary of English Place Names, A.D. Mills, 1998 modern day MancetterGraham Webster, Boudica: The British Revolt against Rome AD 60, 1978 and military finds of armour and military coinage relating to the 14th Legion, whom TacitusTacitus, Annals 14.34 records formed part of Suetonius' army, have been found in the region, giving weight to Webster's hypothesis. Another possible site put forward by Jack Lucas is the area east of Rugby, and whilst other theories exist for locations outside of Warwickshire, the exact location is unknown. After the defeat of the Iceni reinforcements were sent by the Romans from GermanyTacitus, Annals 14.38 and a great supply base was set up at a place called the Lunt in Baginton near Coventry which has the unique feature of a circular arena or gyrus for the breaking in of horses and which could have been a collecting point for Iceni horses after the battle. Of Roman settlements in Warwickshire one of significant size was Alauna (modern day Alcester). Alcester was an important Roman settlement of around eighteen hectares laying bestride Ryknild Street in a loop of the River Arrow to the west of its confluence with the River Alne, underlying the modern town. Town defences have been confirmed only on the east side of the settlement's circuit, where they consist of a clay rampart dated to the \\"second century or later\\", fronted by a 2.75 metre wide wall which was probably not contemporary with the bank. There is also a suspected Roman fort around one kilometre to the south-east of the known Roman settlement located on Primrose Hill which overlooks both the confluence of the River Arrow with the River Alne and the junction of Ryknield Street with the road south from the Roman settlement at Salinae Droitwich Spa, known as the Salt Way after the main export from the area in Roman times. Items of bronze were recovered include a harness ring with a masked loop typical of those used by auxiliary cavalry. The earliest occupation date based on these findings appears to be Flavian. Other significant Roman settlements included Tripontium near Rugby and Manduessedum near Atherstone. www.Roman-Britain.org Manduessedum The area around Manduessedum is known to have had an extensive pottery industry, which extended to near what is now Nuneaton, the remains of up to thirty pottery kilns having been found in this area.A History of Warwickshire, by Canon Doctor Terry Slater (1981) Anglo-Saxon period Kingdom of Mercia Covering the period from the fall of the Roman empire to the Norman invasion of 1066. After the Romans left Britain in the 5th century, the Warwickshire area was settled by Anglo Saxon tribes becoming a part of the kingdom of Mercia. While its earliest boundaries will never be known, there is general agreement that the territory that was called \\"the first of the Mercians\\" in the Tribal Hidage covered much of south Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire and Northern Warwickshire.Brooks, Nicholas Anglo-Saxon myths: state and church, 400-1066Hill, D. Atlas of Anglo-Saxon England, Oxford (1981), map 136Hooke, Della Anglo-Saxon Territorial Organisation: The Western Margins of Mercia, University of Birmingham, Dept. of Geography, Occasional Paper 22 (1986) pp.1-45 Following the decline of the Mercian kingdom during the early 9th century, large parts of Mercia to the east of Warwickshire were ceded in 878 to Danish (Viking) invaders by King Alfred's Treaty of Wedmore with the Danish leader Guthrum. Watling Street, on the north-eastern edge of Warwickshire, became the boundary between the Danelaw (the kingdom of the Danes) to the east and the much reduced Mercia to the west. There was also a boundary with the kingdom of Wessex to the south. Owing to its location at the frontier between two kingdoms, what is now Warwickshire needed to establish defences against the threat of Danish invasion. Between, 911 and 918 this task was undertaken by the \\"Lady of the Mercians\\" √Üthelfl√¶d, daughter of King Alfred, who was responsible for defences against the Danes at Tamworth (see Tamworth Castle) in 914 and the building of the first parts of Warwick Castle in 916.Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, ed. M. Swanton (Dent, London 1997), s.a. 911-918. Periodic fighting between Danes and Saxons occurred until the 11th century. The establishment of the burh by √Üthelfl√¶d in 914 and Warwick's subsequent status as a shire town must have given some impetus to economic development. The town was, at any rate, sufficiently important to have had one of the two royal mints set up in Warwickshire (the other was at Tamworth). Coins are first known to have been issued in the reign of Athelstan (925-39).'The borough of Warwick: Economic and social history to 1545', A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 8: The City of Coventry and Borough of Warwick (1969), pp. 480-489.

In the early 11th century, new internal boundaries within the Mercian kingdom were drawn and Warwickshire came into being as the lands administered from Warwick. The county was initially divided into ten hundreds, their names as given in the Domesday Book, were 'Berricestone', 'Bomelau', 'Coleshelle', 'Fernecumbe', 'Fexhole', 'Honesberie', 'Meretone', 'Patelau', 'Stanlei', and 'Tremelau', they were reduced to four in the 12th century and were named Barlichway, Hemlingford, Kineton or Kington, and Knightlow.'The hundreds of Warwickshire', A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 3: Barlichway hundred (1945), pp. 1-4.

Alice Dryden, 1908 Many of the main settlements of Warwickshire were established in the Middle Ages as market towns, including Birmingham, Bedworth, Nuneaton, Rugby and Stratford-upon-Avon amongst others. The county was dominated throughout the medieval period by Coventry which became one of the most important cities in England and an important centre of wool and textiles trades. The city has held the title of episcopal see, Lichfield and Coventry, from the time of Earl Leofric early in the 11th century arising from the monastery he and his wife, Godiva, founded in 1043.Coventry's Heritage,Levi Fox, Birmingham: Journal Printing Office, 1957 Henry VI and his queen Margaret of Anjou made several visits to Coventry, and in 1451, as a mark of favour, Coventry and certain hamlets and villages adjacent became an entire and separate county, the County of the City of Coventry and the Bailiffs raised to the rank of Sheriffs.

William Andrews,1893 The Gunpowder Plot of 1605 was a Warwickshire conspiracy. The conspirators' principal aim was to kill King James, however another important objective was the kidnapping of the King's daughter, third in the line of succession, Princess Elizabeth. Housed at Coombe Abbey near Coventry, the Princess lived only ten miles north of Warwick, convenient for the plotters, most of whom lived in the Midlands. Once the King and his Parliament were dead, the plotters intended to install Elizabeth on the English throne as a titular Queen.Fraser, Antonia, The Gunpowder Plot, Phoenix, (2005) [1996], Robert Catesby, the prime mover in the conspiratory, was a Warwickshire man, born probably at Bushwood, near Lapworth and John Grant, whose house at Northbrook, Snitterfield, was the rendezvous and powder magazine of the conspirators, was of the gentry of the county. Other conspirators rented houses in the neighbourhood, Ambrose Rokewood rented Clopton House, near Stratford, Everard Digby, to whom the task of rousing the Catholic gentry of the Midlands was assigned rented Coughton Court the home of the Throckmortons under the guise of a \\"hunting party\\". The Wrights moved to Lapworth and the rooms in London were rented by Thomas Percy from Henry Ferrers whose home of Baddesley Clinton was in turn rented to the Vaux sisters, relatives of Catesby. After the discovery of the plot and the arrest of Guy Fawkes was known, the conspirators rode from London to Warwickshire, meeting Digby's hunting party at the Red Lion at Dunchurch to discuss their plans. The final flight took place on 6 November, the fugitives raided Warwick Castle for supplies and continued to Norbrook to collect weapons. From there they continued their journey to Huddington. Thomas Bates left the group and travelled to Coughton Court to deliver a letter from Catesby, to Father Garnet and the other priests, informing them of what had transpired, and asking for their help in raising an army. Garnet replied by begging Catesby and his followers to stop their \\"wicked actions\\", before himself fleeing. The closing events now take place out of Warwickshire as they continued on to Holbeche House on the border of Staffordshire where they were captured. During the English Civil War in the 17th century the county was generally on the Parliamentarian side, Lord Brooke of Warwick Castle being one of the fiecest enemies of the king. The Battle of Edgehill (1642) was fought in Warwickshire, near the Oxfordshire border. Prince Rupert, who was in charge of the Royalist forces, marched his soldiers through Henley in Arden in 1643 on his way to Birmingham and pillaged the neighbourhood.'Parishes: Henley-in-Arden', A History of the County of Warwick: Volume 3: Barlichway hundred (1945), pp. 206-212.

Modern period From the accession of George I to the present day. During the 18th and 19th centuries Warwickshire became one of Britain's foremost industrial counties. The coalfields of northern Warwickshire were amongst the most productive in the country, and greatly enhanced the industrial growth of Coventry and Birmingham. One notable exception was the town of Leamington Spa which grew from a small village to a medium-sized town during the 19th century on the back of the fashionable spa water tourist movement of the time. Warwickshire became a centre of the national canal system, with major arterial routes such as the Oxford Canal the Coventry Canal and later, what is now the Grand Union Canal being constructed through the county. One of the first intercity railway lines: the London and Birmingham Railway ran through Warwickshire. And during the 19th century, the county developed a dense railway network. Towns like Nuneaton, Bedworth, and Rugby also became industrialised. The siting of a major railway junction in the town was the key factor in the industrial growth of Rugby. Towards the end of the 19th century Birmingham and Coventry had become large industrial cities in their own right, and so administrative boundaries had to change. In 1889 the administrative county of Warwickshire was created, and both Coventry and Birmingham became county boroughs which made them administratively separate from the rest of Warwickshire. Solihull later followed as a county borough. These boroughs remained part of the ceremonial county of Warwickshire, which expanded into Worcestershire and Staffordshire as Birmingham annexed surrounding villages. This situation lasted until 1974, when the two cities along with Solihull were removed from Warwickshire altogether, and along with parts of Staffordshire and Worcestershire became a part of the new West Midlands metropolitan county. The remaining post-1974 county of Warwickshire was left with a rather odd shape, which looks as if a large chunk has been bitten out of it where Coventry, Solihull and Birmingham used to be.

It was a merger of the British Seafarers' Union and the National Union of Ship's Stewards, both of which were opposed to the principal trade union in the shipping industry, the National Sailors' and Firemen's Union. At the outset, the AMWU expressed an ambition to replace the NSFU and ultimately to become part of the recently established Transport and General Workers Union. But a number of factors limited the union's effectiveness. It faced resistance from both the NSFU and the Shipping Federation, which collaborated through the National Maritime Board to control access to employment in the shipping industry. The AMWU also suffered from severe internal divisions. In 1923 and 1925, the AMWU once again found itself unsuccessfully resisting wage reductions. In the latter instance, its effectiveness was limited by the refusal of its general secretary (Joe Cotter) to sign cheques, and the consequent impossibility of accessing union funds. The union also lost ground at this time to the Seamen's Section of the National Minority Movement (formed 1924), which attracted many of those seafarers who were most determined to resist the reductions. The Minority Movement, which was sponsored by the Communist Party and included black activist seafarers in this xenophobic period, was suspicious of the AMWU. Such activists regarded the AMWU as a sectional organisation. In 1926, a former member of the National Union of Ship's Stewards launched a legal challenge to the union's status, alleging that the ballot which brought about the merger of the two organisations had not been properly conducted. The AMWU lost this challenge and, as a result, was unable to access its funds. Despite the efforts of its National Organiser, Manny Shinwell, the AMWU was wound up in early 1927.

Economic history Coventry was one of England's most important cities during the Middle Ages, its prosperity built upon wool and cloth manufacture. Birmingham and Wolverhampton have a tradition of industry dating back to the 16th century when small metal-working industries developed. Birmingham was known for its manufacture of small arms, whereas Wolverhampton became a centre for lock manufacture and brass working. Birmingham and Coventry became important centres of the car industry from the early 20th century. The Austin car plant was built in 1905 at Longbridge, to the south of Birmingham, and gradually expanded over the next 75 years, but closed down in 2005 on the bankruptcy of MG Rover. Since 2007, part of the former Longbridge plant has been reused by new owners Nanjing Automobile for the production of MG Cars. Iconic cars to have been produced at the Longbridge plant include the Austin Seven (launched in 1922), the Mini (1959), BMC/BL 1100/1300 saloons and estates (1962) and Austin Metro (1980). Castle Bromwich Assembly was built in the late 1930s for the manufacture of Spitfire aircraft, which continued throughout World War II. Aircraft manufacturing at the plant continued until 1977, when it was sold to Jaguar for car production. The factory remains in use four decades later. Around the same time that the Castle Bromwich Assembly was built, the government built a shadow factory at Solihull, which produced aircraft for the war effort. After the war, the plant was taken over by Rover cars, who relocated from their Lode Lane plant in Coventry. The Land Rover, Britain's first four-wheel drive off-road vehicle, was first produced at the Solihull factory in 1948. The factory expanded and increased in productivity over the subsequent decades to allow for the production of Rover, Land Rover and more recently Jaguar cars. The coal and iron ore deposits of the Black Country area provided a ready source of raw material. The area grew rapidly during the Industrial Revolution, and by the 20th century had grown into one large conurbation. However, the Black Country's coal mining industry was in decline by the early 20th century and the last coal pit in the area, Baggeridge Colliery at Sedgley, closed in 1968. Heavy industry began to decline in the 1970s and 1980s, with towns including Bilston, Darlaston, Wednesbury, Tipton and Brierley Hill being hit particularly hard by factory closures. However, new lighter industry began to develop in some of these areas, with a large retail park developing in the north of Wednesbury during the 1990s and a light industrial estate being built in the south of the town. Brierley Hill became home to the Merry Hill Shopping Centre, which developed between 1985 and 1990. Many of the former industrial sites in Tipton, however, have been mostly developed for new housing. Coventry was slower to develop, but by the early 20th century had become an important centre for bicycle and car manufacture, soon becoming Britain's most important area for car manufacturing. The city's population soared during the interwar years as a result, and expansion continued after World War II, along with rebuilding following the city's severe wartime bomb damage. A number of factories were built in the city for the wartime effort, including a Daimler shadow plant in the north-west of the city, which was taken over by Jaguar in 1951 and remained the carmaker's main site until 2005, when the factory was closed and the company concentrated on its factories at Castle Bromwich near Birmingham and the Halewood plant (originally a Ford facility) near Liverpool. The Rootes Group, whose brands including Hillman, Singer and Sunbeam, opened a factory at Ryton to the east of the city at the start of World War II, and in peacetime it was converted for car production. Such was the success of the company in the postwar era that it opened another factory at Linwood in Scotland in 1963, just before its takeover by American carmaking giant Chrysler, but financial difficulties saw the company being taken over by French carmaker Peugeot in 1978. From 1986, the plant was used by Peugeot for production of its own cars after it discontinued the Talbot brand, but in December 2006 the plant was closed down, leaving the city with virtually no car industry remaining. The growth of the area in the 19th century, which attracted thousands of families from rural communities, led to extensive building of houses across the region. Many villages grew into towns, while others swallowed up neighbouring communities. However, this led to overpopulation in many areas, with a large percentage of the region's population living in unfit housing by the early 20th century. This led to the extensive construction of council housing, mostly on new suburban housing estates. Notable developments in the region during this era include Weoley Castle in Birmingham, Low Hill in Wolverhampton, the Priory Estate in Dudley, Friar Park in West Bromwich and Blakenall Heath in Walsall. The region suffered significant air raid damage by the Luftwaffe during World War II, with thousands of buildings damaged and people killed or seriously injured in Birmingham and Coventry, while there was a lesser degree of bomb damage in towns including Dudley, Tipton and West Bromwich. Several of the less densely populated areas, including Sedgley, Stourbridge or Halesowen, suffered little or no bomb damage. The rebuilding of the region continued after World War II. The region's first multi-storey flats were built in the 1950s, although these were mostly built in the larger towns where space for housebuilding was already very limited. Some of the region's population was rehoused in the new town of Telford in Shropshire which was developed mostly in the 1960s and 1970s, or in expanded towns like Redditch in Worcestershire. The largest housing development in the Midlands during the postwar era was the Castle Vale estate in Birmingham. Many inner city areas and town centres became less densely populated as a result of this continued regeneration of housing. The area also became connected to the new motorway network in the 1960s, with the M5 motorway terminating between Walsall and West Bromwich, and when completed it gave the region a direct link to areas in the south of England including Bristol and Exeter. The M6 motorway joined up with the M1 motorway to the south, giving the area a direct motorway link to London, and gave a direct motorway link to Liverpool and Manchester in the north. The M42 motorway was developed around the south of Birmingham to serve Birmingham Airport as well as nearby towns including Redditch, Bromsgrove and Tamworth, during the 1970s and 1980s. The M54 motorway, linking the area with Telford, was built around the same time. The M40 motorway was completed in January 1991, giving the area its second motorway link with London, as well as improving its links with the South Coast seaports of Southampton and Portsmouth, along with the university city of Oxford. In 2003, Britain's first toll motorway, the M6 Toll, opened, bypassing the West Midlands to the north. Sport The West Midlands also has a strong association with professional sport. Warwickshire CC, the highly successful county cricket team, is based at Edgbaston, Birmingham. Aston Villa, West Bromwich Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers were all founder members of the Football League in 1888, and were joined within a few years by Birmingham City and later a fifth team, Walsall. Aston Villa were the English league's most successful teams during its first 25 years, winning the league title and FA Cup on many occasions, as well as being the first winners of the Football League Cup in 1961, and one of several English teams to have won the European Cup when they lifted it in 1982. West Bromwich Albion were league champions in 1920 and had won the FA Cup five times by 1968, as well as the League Cup in 1966. Wolverhampton Wanderers enjoyed their most successful era during the 1950s, when they were league champions three times, and have also won a total of four FA Cups and two League Cups. Birmingham City have been less successful, their only two major trophies being two victories in the Football League Cup, while Walsall have yet to reach the top division of English football. Civic history During the 20th century a number of attempts were made to improve the local government of the area. The West Midlands was one of five \\"Special Review Areas\\" named in the Local Government Act 1958. The Local Government Commission for England established by the Act was charged with: :\\"the duty of reviewing the organisation of local government... and of making such proposals as are hereinafter authorised for effecting changes appearing... desirable in the interests of effective and convenient local government.\\" The West Midlands Special Review Area was almost identical to the metropolitan county as created in 1974 (with the exception of the Meriden Gap and Coventry). The Commission's report lead to a substantial reform in the local government of the area in 1966 as the patchwork of county boroughs with municipal boroughs and urban districts in between was replaced by a core of county boroughs covering a contiguous area ‚Äì specifically Birmingham, Dudley, Solihull, Walsall, Warley, West Bromwich, Wolverhampton. The urban districts and boroughs abolished included Amblecote, Bilston, Brierley Hill, Coseley, Darlaston, Oldbury, Rowley Regis, Sedgley, Smethwick, Tipton, Wednesbury and Wednesfield. Warley was entirely new, formed by the merger of the county borough of Smethwick with Oldbury and Rowley Regis, whilst the other districts and boroughs were partitioned variously between the existing county boroughs. Solihull had been newly promoted to be a county borough in 1964, whilst Birmingham, already by far the largest county borough in the country, did not expand any further at this stage. A single West Midlands Constabulary was formed for the Black Country county boroughs, whilst Birmingham retained its Birmingham City Police and Solihull continued being policed by Warwickshire Constabulary. On 1 October 1969, West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority was established, which covered the county boroughs, the urban districts bordering these, as well as Cannock, Redditch and some surrounding rural districts. The Redcliffe-Maud Report commissioned by Harold Wilson's Labour Party government recommended that a large \\"metropolitan area\\" be created around the Birmingham/Black Country conurbation, also including its rural hinterland. This was to have been divided into seven districts: Mid-Staffordshire (Tamworth, Rugeley, Lichfield, Cannock, Stafford), Wolverhampton, Walsall, Dudley, West Bromwich-Warley (later Sandwell), Birmingham/Solihull, North Worcestershire (Bewdley, Kidderminster, Bromsgrove, Redditch). In the event the Conservative government of Edward Heath was elected in 1970 and the original plans for local government reform were radically altered. The West Midlands county was created in 1974, under the Local Government Act of 1972. This area was based on the seven county boroughs and four other non-county boroughs and urban districts around the fringe of the conurbation ‚Äì Aldridge-Brownhills, Halesowen, Stourbridge, and Sutton Coldfield. The area was divided into seven new metropolitan boroughs ‚Äì Aldridge-Brownhills was added to Walsall; Halesowen and Stourbridge to Dudley and Sutton Coldfield to Birmingham. A new borough of Sandwell was formed by the merger of West Bromwich and Warley, Solihull took in much of the suburban fringe to the east of Birmingham and the gap between Solihull and Coventry, whilst Wolverhampton and Coventry themselves were taken in more-or-less unaltered. This led to (apart from in the east, with Coventry and the Meriden Gap) quite a tightly defined metropolitan border, excluding such places as Burntwood, Bromsgrove, Cannock, Kidderminster, Lichfield and Wombourne which had been considered for inclusion in the West Midlands metropolitan area by the Redcliffe-Maud Report, but excluding only a small amount that was considered part of the contiguous built-up area of the West Midlands conurbation in 2001. The inclusion of Coventry into the new county was at the time highly controversial, as many people felt that Coventry had more in common with the surrounding Warwickshire area then with the Birmingham conurbation. There have been calls for Coventry to be more integrated with the surrounding Warwickshire area ‚Äì which to some extent have been heeded with the creation of a Coventry and Warwickshire NHS trust and a C&W; chamber of commerce. The 1974 reform created a West Midlands County Council that covered the entire area and dealt with strategic issues. A new West Midlands Police service was formed covering the entire area, with the West Midlands Constabulary and Birmingham City Police abolished, and also taking over responsibility from the county forces. Margaret Thatcher's government abolished the metropolitan county councils with the Local Government Act 1985, in 1986, causing the seven metropolitan boroughs to become de facto unitary authorities.

Parliamentary coverage is produced and broadcast from studios in London. Through BBC English Regions, the BBC also has regional centres across England and national news centres in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. All nations and English regions produce their own local news programmes and other current affairs and sport programmes. The BBC is a quasi-autonomous corporation authorised by royal charter, making it operationally independent of the government, who have no power to appoint or dismiss its director general, and require it to report impartially. However, as with all major media outlets, it has been accused of political bias from across the political spectrum, both within the United Kingdom and abroad. History =Early years= The British Broadcasting Company broadcast its first radio bulletin from radio station 2LO on 14 November 1922. Wishing to avoid competition, newspaper publishers persuaded the government to ban the BBC from broadcasting news before 7:00 pm, and to force it to use wire service copy instead of reporting on its own. The BBC gradually gained the right to edit the copy and, in 1934, created its own news operation. However, it could not broadcast news before 6 PM until World War II. In addition to news, Gaumont British and Movietone cinema newsreels had been broadcast on the TV service since 1936, with the BBC producing its own equivalent Television Newsreel programme from January 1948. A weekly Children's Newsreel was inaugurated on 23 April 1950, to around 350,000 receivers. The network began simulcasting its radio news on television in 1946, with a still picture of Big Ben. Televised bulletins began on 5 July 1954, broadcast from leased studios within Alexandra Palace in London. The public's interest in television and live events was stimulated by Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953. It is estimated that up to 27 million people viewed the programme in the UK, overtaking radio's audience of 12 million for the first time. Those live pictures were fed from 21 cameras in central London to Alexandra Palace for transmission, and then on to other UK transmitters opened in time for the event. That year, there were around two million TV Licences held in the UK, rising to over three million the following year, and four and a half million by 1955. =1950s= Television news, although physically separate from its radio counterpart, was still firmly under radio news' control in the 1950s. Correspondents provided reports for both outlets, and the first televised bulletin, shown on 5 July 1954 on the then BBC television service and presented by Richard Baker, involved his providing narration off-screen while stills were shown. This was then followed by the customary Television Newsreel with a recorded commentary by John Snagge (and on other occasions by Andrew Timothy). On-screen newsreaders were introduced a year later in 1955 Kenneth Kendall (the first to appear in vision), Robert Dougall, and Richard Baker‚Äìthree weeks before ITN's launch on 21 September 1955. Mainstream television production had started to move out of Alexandra Palace in 1950 to larger premises mainly at Lime Grove Studios in Shepherd's Bush, west London taking Current Affairs (then known as Talks Department) with it. It was from here that the first Panorama, a new documentary programme, was transmitted on 11 November 1953, with Richard Dimbleby becoming anchor in 1955. In 1958, Hugh Carleton Greene became head of News and Current Affairs. =1960s= On 1 January 1960, Greene became Director-General. Greene made changes that were aimed at making BBC reporting more similar to it competitor ITN, which had been highly rated by study groups held by Greene. A newsroom was created at Alexandra Palace, television reporters were recruited and given the opportunity to write and voice their own scripts‚Äìwithout having to cover stories for radio too. In 1987, John Birt resurrected the practice of correspondents working for both TV and radio with the introduction of bi-media journalism, and 2008 saw tri-media introduced across TV, radio, and online. On 20 June 1960, Nan Winton, the first female BBC network newsreader, appeared in vision. 19 September 1960 saw the start of the radio news and current affairs programme The Ten O'clock News. BBC2 started transmission on 20 April 1964 and began broadcasting a new show, Newsroom. The World at One, a lunchtime news programme, began on 4 October 1965 on the then Home Service, and the year before News Review had started on television. News Review was a summary of the week's news, first broadcast on Sunday, 26 April 1964 on BBC 2 and harking back to the weekly Newsreel Review of the Week, produced from 1951, to open programming on Sunday evenings‚Äìthe difference being that this incarnation had subtitles for the deaf and hard-of- hearing. As this was the decade before electronic caption generation, each superimposition (\\"super\\") had to be produced on paper or card, synchronised manually to studio and news footage, committed to tape during the afternoon, and broadcast early evening. Thus Sundays were no longer a quiet day for news at Alexandra Palace. The programme ran until the 1980s by then using electronic captions, known as Anchor to be superseded by Ceefax subtitling (a similar Teletext format), and the signing of such programmes as See Hear (from 1981). On Sunday 17 September 1967, The World This Weekend, a weekly news and current affairs programme, launched on what was then Home Service, but soon- to-be Radio 4. Preparations for colour began in the autumn of 1967 and on Thursday 7 March 1968 Newsroom on BBC2 moved to an early evening slot, becoming the first UK news programme to be transmitted in colourHistory of the BBC ‚Äì key dates page 5 BBC Heritage 1960s. from Studio A at Alexandra Palace. News Review and Westminster (the latter a weekly review of Parliamentary happenings) were \\"colourised\\" shortly after. However, much of the insert material was still in black and white, as initially only a part of the film coverage shot in and around London was on colour reversal film stock, and all regional and many international contributions were still in black and white. Colour facilities at Alexandra Palace were technically very limited for the next eighteen months, as it had only one RCA colour Quadruplex videotape machine and, eventually two Pye plumbicon colour telecines‚Äìalthough the news colour service started with just one. Black and white national bulletins on BBC 1 continued to originate from Studio B on weekdays, along with Town and Around, the London regional \\"opt out\\" programme broadcast throughout the 1960s (and the BBC's first regional news programme for the South East), until it started to be replaced by Nationwide on Tuesday to Thursday from Lime Grove Studios early in September 1969. Town and Around was never to make the move to Television Centre instead it became London This Week which aired on Mondays and Fridays only, from the new TVC studios.London This Week had started in early 1969 as a once per week \\"opt out\\" replacing the Friday edition of Town and Around Television News moves to Television Centre Television News moved to BBC Television Centre in September 1969. The BBC moved production out of Alexandra Palace in 1969. BBC Television News resumed operations the next day with a lunchtime bulletin on BBC1 in black and white from Television Centre, where it remained until March 2013. This move to a smaller studio with better technical facilities allowed Newsroom and News Review to replace back projection with colour-separation overlay. During the 1960s, satellite communication had become possible; 1960s & 70s, British TV History however, it was some years before digital line-store conversion was able to undertake the process seamlessly. =1970s= Angela Rippon, pictured in 1983, became the first female news presenter in 1975. On 14 September 1970, the first Nine O'Clock News was broadcast on television. Robert Dougall presented the first week from studio N1 described by The Guardian as \\"a sort of polystyrene padded cell\\" Robert Dougall was even less flattering about the first set, and is quoted as saying that the tiling was \\"grey and lavatorial\\" 1970 Voices from the field together with \\"a huge round thing\\" in the background referring to the new rotating clockface logo and CSO screen. Newswatch, BBC.‚Äîthe bulletin having been moved from the earlier time of 20.50 as a response to the ratings achieved by ITN's News at Ten, introduced three years earlier on the rival ITV. Richard Baker and Kenneth Kendall presented subsequent weeks, thus echoing those first television bulletins of the mid-1950s. Angela Rippon became the first female news presenter of the Nine O'Clock News in 1975. Her work outside the news was controversial at the time, appearing on The Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show in 1976 singing and dancing. The first edition of John Craven's Newsround, initially intended only as a short series and later renamed just Newsround, came from studio N3 on 4 April 1972. Afternoon television news bulletins during the mid to late 1970s were broadcast from the BBC newsroom itself, rather than one of the three news studios. The newsreader would present to camera while sitting on the edge of a desk; behind him staff would be seen working busily at their desks. This period corresponded with when the Nine O'Clock News got its next makeover, and would use a CSO background of the newsroom from that very same camera each weekday evening. Also in the mid-1970s, the late night news on BBC2 was briefly renamed Newsnight, but this was not to last, or be the same programme as we know today that would be launched in 1980 and it soon reverted to being just a news summary with the early evening BBC2 news expanded to become Newsday. News on radio was to change in the 1970s, and on Radio 4 in particular, brought about by the arrival of new editor Peter Woon from television news and the implementation of the Broadcasting in the Seventies report. These included the introduction of correspondents into news bulletins where previously only a newsreader would present, as well as the inclusion of content gathered in the preparation process. New programmes were also added to the daily schedule, PM and The World Tonight as part of the plan for the station to become a \\"wholly speech network\\". Newsbeat launched as the news service on Radio 1 on 10 September 1973.History of the BBC ‚Äì key dates page 4 BBC Heritage 1970s. On 23 September 1974, a teletext system which was launched to bring news content on television screens using text only was launched. Engineers originally began developing such a system to bring news to deaf viewers, but the system was expanded. The Ceefax service became much more diverse before it ceased on 23 October 2012: it not only had subtitling for all channels, it also gave information such as weather, flight times and film reviews. By the end of the decade, the practice of shooting on film for inserts in news broadcasts was declining, with the introduction of ENG technology into the UK. The equipment would gradually become less cumbersome the BBC's first attempts had been using a Philips colour camera with backpack base station and separate portable Sony U-matic recorder in the latter half of the decade. =1980s= By 1982, ENG technology had become sufficiently reliable for Bernard Hesketh to use an Ikegami camera to cover the Falklands War, coverage for which he won the \\"Royal Television Society Cameraman of the Year\\" award and a BAFTA nominationBAFTA 1981 awards British Academy of Film and Television Arts. ‚Äì the first time that BBC News had relied upon an electronic camera, rather than film, in a conflict zone.

Newsnight, the news and current affairs programme, was due to go on air on 23 January 1980, although trade union disagreements meant that its launch from Lime Grove was postponed by a week. On 27 August 1981 Moira Stuart became the first African Caribbean female newsreader to appear on British television. The first BBC breakfast television programme, Breakfast Time also launched during the 1980s, on 17 January 1983 from Lime Grove Studio E and two weeks before its ITV rival TV-am. Frank Bough, Selina Scott, and Nick Ross helped to wake viewers with a relaxed style of presenting. The Six O'Clock News first aired on 3 September 1984, eventually becoming the most watched news programme in the UK (however, since 2006 it has been overtaken by the BBC News at Ten). In October 1984, images of millions of people starving to death in the Ethiopian famine were shown in Michael Buerk's Six O'Clock News reports.\\"Live Aid: The show that rocked the world\\". BBC. Retrieved 7 January 2018 The BBC News crew were the first to document the famine, with Buerk's report on 23 October describing it as \\"a biblical famine in the 20th century\\" and \\"the closest thing to hell on Earth\\". The BBC News report shocked Britain, motivating its citizens to inundate relief agencies, such as Save the Children, with donations, and to bring global attention to the crisis in Ethiopia. The news report was also watched by Bob Geldof, who would organise the charity single \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\" to raise money for famine relief followed by the Live Aid concert in July 1985. Starting in 1981, the BBC gave a common theme to its main news bulletins with new electronic titles‚Äìa set of computer animated \\"stripes\\" forming a circleThe circle had been a recurring theme of the BBC1 news logo since the start of the Nine in 1970, as it was thought to fit in nicely with the long-running BBC 1 globe ident, and clock face which normally precedes news broadcasts. Used until 1986, the hard wired news version was known as ANT (Animated News Titles) BBCEng.info and this new logo was drawn live triggered by an audio tone on track two of the two-track mono quarter-inch audio tape of opening title music to ensure sychronisation and also produced the \\"venetian blind\\" wipe to the opening story. on a red background with a \\"BBC News\\" typescript appearing below the circle graphics, and a theme tune consisting of brass and keyboards. The Nine used a similar (striped) number 9. The red background was replaced by a blue from 1985 until 1987. By 1987, the BBC had decided to re-brand its bulletins and established individual styles again for each one with differing titles and music, the weekend and holiday bulletins branded in a similar style to the Nine, although the \\"stripes\\" introduction continued to be used until 1989 on occasions where a news bulletin was screened out of the running order of the schedule. =1990s= The combined newsroom for domestic television and radio was opened at Television Centre in West London in 1998. During the 1990s, a wider range of services began to be offered by BBC News, with the split of BBC World Service Television to become BBC World (news and current affairs), and BBC Prime (light entertainment). Content for a 24-hour news channel was thus required, followed in 1997 with the launch of domestic equivalent BBC News 24. Rather than set bulletins, ongoing reports and coverage was needed to keep both channels functioning and meant a greater emphasis in budgeting for both was necessary. In 1998, after 66 years at Broadcasting House, the BBC Radio News operation moved to BBC Television Centre. New technology, provided by Silicon Graphics, came into use in 1993 for a re-launch of the main BBC 1 bulletins, creating a virtual set which appeared to be much larger than it was physically. The relaunch also brought all bulletins into the same style of set with only small changes in colouring, titles, and music to differentiate each. A computer generated cut- glass sculpture of the BBC coat of arms was the centrepiece of the programme titles until the large scale corporate rebranding of news services in 1999. In 1999, the biggest relaunch occurred, with BBC One bulletins, BBC World, BBC News 24, and BBC News Online all adopting a common style. One of the most significant changes was the gradual adoption of the corporate image by the BBC regional news programmes, giving a common style across local, national and international BBC television news. This also included Newyddion, the main news programme of Welsh language channel S4C, produced by BBC News Wales. =2000s= Following the relaunch of BBC News the previous year, regional headlines were included at the start of the BBC One news bulletins in 2000. The English regions did however lose five minutes at the end of their bulletins, due to a new headline round-up at 18:55. 2000 also saw the Nine O'Clock News moved to the later time of 22:00. This was in response to ITN who had just moved their popular News at Ten programme to 23:00. ITN briefly returned News at Ten but following poor ratings when head to head against the BBC's Ten O'Clock News, the ITN bulletin was moved to 22.30, where it remained until 14 January 2008. The retirement of Peter Sissons and departure of Michael Buerk from the Ten O'Clock News led to changes in the BBC One bulletin presenting team on 20 January 2003. The Six O'Clock News became double headed with George Alagiah and Sophie Raworth after Huw Edwards and Fiona Bruce moved to present the Ten. A new set design featuring a projected fictional newsroom backdrop was introduced, followed on 16 February 2004 by new programme titles to match those of BBC News 24. BBC News 24 and BBC World introduced a new style of presentation in December 2003, that was slightly altered on 5 July 2004 to mark 50 years of BBC Television News. The individual positions of editor of the One and Six O'Clock News were replaced by a new daytime position in November 2005. Kevin Bakhurst became the first Controller of BBC News 24, replacing the position of editor. Amanda Farnsworth became daytime editor while Craig Oliver was later named editor of the Ten O'Clock News. The bulletins also began to be simulcast with News 24, as a way of pooling resources. Bulletins received new titles and a new set design in May 2006, to allow for Breakfast to move into the main studio for the first time since 1997. The new set featured Barco videowall screens with a background of the London skyline used for main bulletins and originally an image of cirrus clouds against a blue sky for Breakfast. This was later replaced following viewer criticism. The studio bore similarities with the ITN-produced ITV News in 2004, though ITN uses a CSO Virtual studio rather than the actual screens at BBC News. Also, May saw the launch of World News Today the first domestic bulletin focused principally on international news. BBC News became part of a new BBC Journalism group in November 2006 as part of a restructuring of the BBC. The then-Director of BBC News, Helen Boaden reported to the then-Deputy Director-General and head of the journalism group, Mark Byford until he was made redundant in 2010.BBC's Mark Byford made redundant, Neil Midgley, Daily Telegraph,11 October 2010. Retrieved: 2 April 2013. On 18 October 2007, Mark Thompson announced a six-year plan, Delivering Creative Future, merging the television current affairs department into a new \\"News Programmes\\" division. Thompson's announcement, in response to a ¬£2 billion shortfall in funding, would, he said, deliver \\"a smaller but fitter BBC\\" in the digital age, by cutting its payroll and, in 2013, selling Television Centre. The various separate newsrooms for television, radio and online operations were merged into a single multimedia newsroom. Programme making within the newsrooms was brought together to form a multimedia programme making department. BBC World Service director Peter Horrocks said that the changes would achieve efficiency at a time of cost-cutting at the BBC. In his blog, he wrote that by using the same resources across the various broadcast media meant fewer stories could be covered, or by following more stories, there would be fewer ways to broadcast them. A new graphics and video playout system was introduced for production of television bulletins in January 2007. This coincided with a new structure to BBC World News bulletins, editors favouring a section devoted to analysing the news stories reported on. The first new BBC News bulletin since the Six O'Clock News was announced in July 2007 following a successful trial in the Midlands. The summary, lasting 90 seconds, has been broadcast at 20:00 on weekdays since December 2007 and bears similarities with 60 Seconds on BBC Three, but also includes headlines from the various BBC regions and a weather summary. As part of a long-term cost cutting programme, bulletins were renamed the BBC News at One, Six and Ten respectively in April 2008 while BBC News 24 was renamed BBC News and moved into the same studio as the bulletins at BBC Television Centre. BBC World was renamed BBC World News and regional news programmes were also updated with the new presentation style, designed by Lambie-Nairn. The studio moves also meant that Studio N9, previously used for BBC World, was closed, and operations moved to the previous studio of BBC News 24. Studio N9 was later refitted to match the new branding, and was used for the BBC's UK local elections and European elections coverage in early June 2009. =2010s= The new newsroom in Broadcasting House A strategy review of the BBC in March 2010, confirmed that having \\"the best journalism in the world\\" would form one of five key editorial policies, as part of changes subject to public consultation and BBC Trust approval.

From August 2012 to March 2013, all news operations moved from Television Centre to new facilities in the refurbished and extended Broadcasting House, in Portland Place. The move began in October 2012, and also included the BBC World Service, which moved from Bush House following the expiry of the BBC's lease. This new extension to the north and east, referred to as \\"New Broadcasting House\\", includes several new state-of- the-art radio and television studios centred around an 11-storey atrium. The move began with the domestic programme The Andrew Marr Show on 2 September 2012, and concluded with the move of the BBC News channel and domestic news bulletins on 18 March 2013.

BBC News content is also output onto the BBC's digital interactive television services under the BBC Red Button brand, and until 2012, on the Ceefax teletext system. The music on all BBC television news programmes was introduced in 1999 and composed by David Lowe. It was part of the re-branding which commenced in 1999 and features 'BBC Pips'. The general theme was used on bulletins on BBC One, News 24, BBC World and local news programmes in the BBC's Nations and Regions. Lowe was also responsible for the music on Radio One's Newsbeat. The theme has had several changes since 1999, the latest in March 2013. The BBC Arabic Television news channel launched on 11 March 2008, a Persian-language channel followed on 14 January 2009, broadcasting from the Peel wing of Broadcasting House; both include news, analysis, interviews, sports and highly cultural programmes and are run by the BBC World Service and funded from a grant-in-aid from the British Foreign Office (and not the television licence). =Radio= BBC Radio News produces bulletins for the BBC's national radio stations and provides content for local BBC radio stations via the General News Service (GNS), a BBC-internal news distribution service.

The BBC World Service broadcasts to some 150 million people in English as well as 27 languages across the globe. BBC Radio News is a patron of the Radio Academy.The Radio Academy \\"Patrons\\" . =Online= BBC News Online is the BBC's news website. Launched in November 1997, it is one of the most popular news websites in the UK, reaching over a quarter of the UK's internet users, and worldwide, with around 14 million global readers every month. The website contains international news coverage as well as entertainment, sport, science, and political news. Mobile apps for Android, iOS and Windows Phone systems have been provided since 2010. Many television and radio programmes are also available to view on the BBC iPlayer and BBC Sounds services. The BBC News channel is also available to view 24 hours a day, while video and radio clips are also available within online news articles. In October 2019, BBC News Online launched a mirror on the dark web anonymity network Tor in an effort to circumvent censorship. Opinions =Political and commercial independence= The BBC is required by its charter to be free from both political and commercial influence and answers only to its viewers and listeners. This political objectivity is sometimes questioned. For instance, The Daily Telegraph (3 August 2005) carried a letter from the KGB defector Oleg Gordievsky, referring to it as \\"The Red Service\\". Books have been written on the subject, including anti-BBC works like Truth Betrayed by W J West and The Truth Twisters by Richard Deacon. The BBC's Editorial Guidelines on Politics and Public Policy state that whilst \\"the voices and opinions of opposition parties must be routinely aired and challenged\\", \\"the government of the day will often be the primary source of news\\".\\"Editorial Guidelines Extracts\\", BBC. The BBC is regularly accused by the government of the day of bias in favour of the opposition and, by the opposition, of bias in favour of the government. Similarly, during times of war, the BBC is often accused by the UK government, or by strong supporters of British military campaigns, of being overly sympathetic to the view of the enemy. An edition of Newsnight at the start of the Falklands War in 1982 was described as \\"almost treasonable\\" by John Page, MP, who objected to Peter Snow saying \\"if we believe the British\\".Denis Taylor, \\"BBC broadcasts jammed\\", The Times, 4 May 1982, p. 2. During the first Gulf War, critics of the BBC took to using the satirical name \\"Baghdad Broadcasting Corporation\\". During the Kosovo War, the BBC were labelled the \\"Belgrade Broadcasting Corporation\\" (suggesting favouritism towards the FR Yugoslavia government over ethnic Albanian rebels) by British ministers, although Slobodan Miloseviƒá (then FRY president) claimed that the BBC's coverage had been biased against his nation. Conversely, some of those who style themselves anti-establishment in the United Kingdom or who oppose foreign wars have accused the BBC of pro-establishment bias or of refusing to give an outlet to \\"anti-war\\" voices. Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a study by the Cardiff University School of Journalism of the reporting of the war found that nine out of 10 references to weapons of mass destruction during the war assumed that Iraq possessed them, and only one in 10 questioned this assumption. It also found that, out of the main British broadcasters covering the war, the BBC was the most likely to use the British government and military as its source. It was also the least likely to use independent sources, like the Red Cross, who were more critical of the war. When it came to reporting Iraqi casualties, the study found fewer reports on the BBC than on the other three main channels. The report's author, Justin Lewis, wrote \\"Far from revealing an anti-war BBC, our findings tend to give credence to those who criticised the BBC for being too sympathetic to the government in its war coverage. Either way, it is clear that the accusation of BBC anti-war bias fails to stand up to any serious or sustained analysis.\\" Prominent BBC appointments are constantly assessed by the British media and political establishment for signs of political bias. The appointment of Greg Dyke as Director-General was highlighted by press sources because Dyke was a Labour Party member and former activist, as well as a friend of Tony Blair. The BBC's former Political Editor, Nick Robinson, was some years ago a chairman of the Young Conservatives and did, as a result, attract informal criticism from the former Labour government, but his predecessor Andrew Marr faced similar claims from the right because he was editor of The Independent, a liberal-leaning newspaper, before his appointment in 2000. Mark Thompson, former Director-General of the BBC, admitted the organisation has been biased \\"towards the left\\" in the past. He said, \\"In the BBC I joined 30 years ago, there was, in much of current affairs, in terms of people's personal politics, which were quite vocal, a massive bias to the left\\". He then added, \\"The organization did struggle then with impartiality. Now it is a completely different generation. There is much less overt tribalism among the young journalists who work for the BBC.\\" Historian Mark Curtis finds that BBC news resembles a \\"straightforward state propaganda organ\\" that provides \\"critical support for the [British and Western] elite's promotion of foreign policy\\", such as the 2003 war of aggression against Iraq. He says this militant nationalism is \\"not even subtle\\", and, citing Glasgow university, says BBC News is a chief example of \\"manufactured production of ideology.\\" Since the aftermath of the EU referendum, some critics have charged that the BBC is biased in favour of leaving the EU. For instance, in 2018, the BBC has received many complaints by Remainers who took issue at the BBC not sufficiently covering anti-Brexit marches whilst giving smaller-scale events hosted by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage more airtime. Such bias has also been expressed by the likes of Labour Peer Andrew Adonis who thought that the BBC 'doesn't even realise it'. On the other hand, a poll released by YouGov shows that 45% of leave voters think the BBC is 'actively anti-Brexit' compared to 13% of the same kinds of voters who think the BBC is pro-Brexit. =India= In 2008, the BBC was criticised by some for referring to the terrorists who carried out the November 2008 Mumbai attacks as \\"gunmen\\".Mealy- mouthed BBC The response to this added to prior criticism from some Indian commentators suggesting that the BBC may have an Indophobic bias. In March 2015, the BBC was criticised for airing a documentary interviewing one of the rapists in India. In spite of a ban ordered by the Indian High court, the BBC still aired the documentary. =Hutton Inquiry= BBC News was at the centre of a political controversy following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Three BBC News reports (Andrew Gilligan's on Today, Gavin Hewitt's on The Ten O'Clock News and another on Newsnight) quoted an anonymous source that stated the British government (particularly the Prime Minister's office) had embellished the September Dossier with misleading exaggerations of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities. The government denounced the reports and accused the corporation of poor journalism. In subsequent weeks the corporation stood by the report, saying that it had a reliable source. Following intense media speculation, David Kelly was named in the press as the source for Gilligan's story on 9 July 2003. Kelly was found dead, by suicide, in a field close to his home early on 18 July. An inquiry led by Lord Hutton was announced by the British government the following day to investigate the circumstances leading to Kelly's death, concluding that \\"Dr. Kelly took his own life.\\" In his report on 28 January 2004, Lord Hutton concluded that Gilligan's original accusation was \\"unfounded\\" and the BBC's editorial and management processes were \\"defective\\". In particular, it specifically criticised the chain of management that caused the BBC to defend its story. The BBC Director of News, Richard Sambrook, the report said, had accepted Gilligan's word that his story was accurate in spite of his notes being incomplete. Davies had then told the BBC Board of Governors that he was happy with the story and told the Prime Minister that a satisfactory internal inquiry had taken place. The Board of Governors, under the chairman's, Gavyn Davies, guidance, accepted that further investigation of the Government's complaints were unnecessary. Because of the criticism in the Hutton report, Davies resigned on the day of publication. BBC News faced an important test, reporting on itself with the publication of the report, but by common consent (of the Board of Governors) managed this \\"independently, impartially and honestly\\". Davies' resignation was followed by the resignation of Director General, Greg Dyke, the following day, and the resignation of Gilligan on 30 January. While undoubtedly a traumatic experience for the corporation, an ICM poll in April 2003 indicated that it had sustained its position as the best and most trusted provider of news. =Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict= The BBC has faced accusations of holding both anti-Israel and anti-Palestine bias. Douglas Davis, the London correspondent of The Jerusalem Post, has described the BBC's coverage of the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict as \\"a relentless, one-dimensional portrayal of Israel as a demonic, criminal state and Israelis as brutal oppressors [which] bears all the hallmarks of a concerted campaign of vilification that, wittingly or not, has the effect of delegitimising the Jewish state and pumping oxygen into a dark old European hatred that dared not speak its name for the past half- century.\\".Davis, Douglas. \\"Hatred in the air: the BBC, Israel and Antisemitism\\" in Iganski, Paul & Kosmin, Barry. (eds) A New Anti-Semitism? Debating Judeophobia in 21st century Britain. Profile Books, 2003, p. 130. However two large independent studies, one conducted by Loughborough University and the other by Glasgow University's Media Group concluded that Israeli perspectives are given greater coverage. Critics of the BBC argue that the Balen Report proves systematic bias against Israel in headline news programming. The Daily Mail and The Daily Telegraph criticised the BBC for spending hundreds of thousands of British tax payers' pounds from preventing the report being released to the public.BBC fights to suppress internal report into allegations of bias against Israel by Andy McSmith (The Independent) 28 March 2007.TTelegraph, BBC mounts court fight to keep 'critical' report secret, 15 October 2006. Jeremy Bowen, the Middle East Editor for BBC world news, was singled out specifically for bias by the BBC Trust which concluded that he violated \\"BBC guidelines on accuracy and impartiality.\\"The Independent, 16 April 2009, Bowen 'breached rules on impartiality'. An independent panel appointed by the BBC Trust was set up in 2006 to review the impartiality of the BBC's coverage of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. The panel's assessment was that \\"apart from individual lapses, there was little to suggest deliberate or systematic bias.\\" While noting a \\"commitment to be fair accurate and impartial\\" and praising much of the BBC's coverage the independent panel concluded \\"that BBC output does not consistently give a full and fair account of the conflict. In some ways the picture is incomplete and, in that sense, misleading.\\" It notes that, \\"the failure to convey adequately the disparity in the Israeli and Palestinian experience, [reflects] the fact that one side is in control and the other lives under occupation\\". Writing in the Financial Times, Philip Stephens, one of the panellists, later accused the BBC's director-general, Mark Thompson, of misrepresenting the panel's conclusions. He further opined \\"My sense is that BBC news reporting has also lost a once iron-clad commitment to objectivity and a necessary respect for the democratic process. If I am right, the BBC, too, is lost\\".Philip Stephens: BBC is losing public service plot, Financial Times, 20 June 2006. Mark Thompson published a rebuttal in the FT the next day.The BBC's success story has a public service plot, Mark Thompson, Financial Times, 21 June 2006. The description by one BBC correspondent reporting on the funeral of Yassir Arafat that she had been left with tears in her eyes led to other questions of impartiality, particularly from Martin Walker in a guest opinion piece in The Times, who picked out the apparent case of Fayad Abu Shamala, the BBC Arabic Service correspondent, who told a Hamas rally on 6 May 2001, that journalists in Gaza were \\"waging the campaign shoulder to shoulder together with the Palestinian people.\\" Walker argues that the independent inquiry was flawed for two reasons. Firstly, because the time period over which it was conducted (August 2005 to January 2006) surrounded the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Ariel Sharon's stroke, which produced more positive coverage than usual. Furthermore, he wrote, the inquiry only looked at the BBC's domestic coverage, and excluded output on the BBC World Service and BBC World. Tom Gross accused the BBC of glorifying Hamas suicide bombers, and condemned its policy of inviting guests such as Jenny Tonge and Tom Paulin who have compared Israeli soldiers to Nazis. Writing for the BBC, Paulin said Israeli soldiers should be \\"shot dead\\" like Hitler's S.S, and said he could \\"understand how suicide bombers feel.\\" According to Gross, Paulin and Tonge continue to be invited as regular guests, and they are among the most frequent contributors to their most widely screened arts programme.Tom Gross on BBC National Review Online. The BBC also faced criticism for not airing a Disasters Emergency Committee aid appeal for Palestinians who suffered in Gaza during 22-day war there in late 2008/early 2009. Most other major UK broadcasters did air this appeal, but rival Sky News did not. British journalist Julie Burchill has accused BBC of creating a \\"climate of fear\\" for British Jews over its \\"excessive coverage\\" of Israel compared to other nations. =Partners= BBC and ABC share video segments and reporters as needed in producing their newscasts. with the BBC showing ABC World News Tonight with David Muir in the UK. However, in July 2017, BBC announced a new partnership with CBS News allows both organisations to share video, editorial content, and additional newsgathering resources in New York, London, Washington and around the world. BBC News subscribes to wire services from leading international agencies including PA Media (formerly Press Association), Reuters, and Agence France-Presse. In April 2017, the BBC dropped Associated Press in favour of an enhanced service from AFP. =The view of foreign governments= BBC News reporters and broadcasts are now and have in the past been banned in several countries primarily for reporting which has been unfavourable to the ruling government. For example, correspondents were banned by the former apartheid r√©gime of South Africa. The BBC was banned in Zimbabwe under Mugabe for eight years as a terrorist organisation until being allowed to operate again over a year after the 2008 elections. The BBC was banned in Burma (officially Myanmar ) after their coverage and commentary on anti-government protests there in September 2007. The ban was lifted four years later in September 2011. Other cases have included Uzbekistan, China, and Pakistan.BBC Urdo taken off Pakistan radio ‚Äì BBC News: 15 November 2005.

The UK's Foreign Office recognised \\"the hurt caused in Rwanda by some parts of the documentary\\". In February 2017, reporters from the BBC (as well as the Daily Mail, The New York Times, Politico, CNN, and others) were denied access to a United States White House briefing.

Interrupted by two ice ages, Worcestershire has had continuous settlement since roughly 10,000 years ago. In the Iron Age, the area was dominated by a series of hill forts, and the beginnings of industrial activity including pottery and salt mining can be found. It seems to have been relatively unimportant during the Roman era, with the exception of the salt workings. During the Anglo-Saxon era, Worcestershire was an important base of Church power and learning. The county as a named political entity dates to this time, being formed in 918. From the Middle Ages, the role of the city of Worcester becomes particularly important in the county. The city's merchants, Church, aristocracy and gentry become the main power brokers, and tensions between them can be seen. The county had an important role in the civil war, being part of the Royalists' front line. It was later the site of Charles II's defeat at the Battle of Worcester in 1651, and local Catholic aristocrats aided his escape. Northern Worcestershire produced a number of prominent religious leaders, many of whom left the Anglican church in the Great Ejection. The northern part of Worcestershire, including the Dudley enclave, was one of the major centres of the British Industrial Revolution. Kidderminster specialised in carpet production, Stourport in glass, Bromsgrove in nail making, Dudley in iron and coal production. Canals and later railways aided export of local goods. Local government reorganisations meant that the Dudley enclave and the King's Norton area of southern Birmingham are no longer in Worcestershire. Other smaller boundary changes have taken some parishes out of the county and added others. Prehistory =Paleolithic= Hallow. Potentially the first Early Middle Palaeolithic artefact from the West Midlands. There is evidence of human presence in Worcestershire from the paleolithic period, roughly 700,000‚Äì500,000 years ago. Flint axe heads have been found near at Hallow near Worcester, for instance. However, evidence from this period is hard to come by, not least because hunter-gathering societies would roam extensively and not congregate in towns and villages. Tools have mostly been recovered from sand and gravel quarries in the county., The lack of finds appears to be contributing to under-investment in seeking out and preserving them. The first inhabitants appear to have followed the Bytham River system, which at the time drained eastwards from Evesham to East Anglia. Glaciation pushed settlement back, and humans again appear around 300,000 years ago. Nearly 40 hand axes from this period have been recovered, mostly from near the last glaciation of around 10,000 BC. 15 axes were recovered at Kemerton. =Mesolithic= Between 10,000 and 3,500BC, at the start of the current Holocene period, the climate improved. Forests grew, allowing humans to reinhabit the area, again with a hunter-gatherer economy. Settlers of the Mesolithic period are often identified through their use of flint tools, such as the 1,400 fragments found near Kidderminster at Wribbenhall. Other finds included post holes, a hearth, gullies and a pit. This site has been dated to roughly 6,800 BC, making it the oldest settlement yet identified in Worcestershire. Pollen evidence shows that crops were already being grown and woodlands cleared. =Neolithic= The evidence for the Neolithic period is more extensive. Finds were first located before the second world war in Bewdley, Lindridge, Broadwas and, at Worcester, a skull. Farming has left many traces, for instance cropmarks on gravel terraces. Settlements can be identified from post holes, for instance at Huntsman's Quarry, Kemerton. However, the most obvious Neolithic evidence comes from their ritual landscape. At Fladbury, a possible cursus has been found, enclosures that may be defined in relationship to changes in the sky and stars. At Whittington Tump a hill has been heightened to make another ceremonial or burial monument. Stone axes from the Neolithic show extensive trade links, including examples from Brittany and northern Italy or Switzerlands, as well as Cornwall, North Wales and the Lake District. Pottery finds also start in this period. Finds at Clifton, Severn Stoke, include Grooved ware pottery, axes, and burnt stones used to heat water for cooking or possibly a sauna. =Bronze Age= Bronze Age finds include weapons come from Worcestershire's valleys especially near potential fordable river crossings on the Avon such as Harvington, Evesham and Defford, and on the Severn, Bewdley, Holt, Worcester, Kempsey and Pixham. Flint axes, arrowheads, and flakes found in the Malvern area are attributed to early Bronze Age settlers Burial sites are also important sources of information about the Bronze Age. Around twenty barrows have been found in the county and two have been excavated, at Holt and Wyre Piddle. Worcestershire changed during the Bronze Age to a predominantly agricultural landscape. Peat evidence from near Bredon Hill and Birlingham in the Avon area shows that it was cleared by the earlier part of the period. A lack of cereal grain finds has been interpreted as indicating that the land was used for cattle farming. The clearance of forest land is also evidenced by alluvium deposits on the lower lands in the county, caused by river flooding. A move towards open settlements may be detected as the lands became more fully occupied. Current field systems may date from the later Bronze Age. For instance, the evidence at Kerton and Wyre Piddle shows a relationship between the Bronze Age boundaries and contemporary fields. The \\"Shire Ditch\\", a late Bronze Age boundary earthwork possibly dates from around 1000 BC, its boundary being respected by later settlement patterns. Similarly, Roman field boundaries seem to have kept their alignment with a Bronze Age boundary at Childswickham. Bronze Age evidence also shows bronze casting and textiles at Kemerton. =Iron Age= alt=Photo of the British Camp hill showing its terraced Iron Age earthworks From around 600BC, Iron Age became the predominant technology, being harder than bronze and easy to manipulate into many tools. In Worcestershire, the most visible reminder of the period is hill forts. There around ten or twelve extant, including British Camp, Wychbury Hill and Hanbury. The full list may include east of the Severn Bredon Hill, Conderton Camp, and Headless Cross; and west of the Severn, Woodbury Hill, Berrow Hill Camp and Gadbury Bank A promontory fort can be found by the Severn at Kempsey. Many are visible to each other, suggesting that they were centres of organisation and power. Their functions may have included meeting places, a means to control livestock, grain storage, residences and tribal centres. Farming in the period shows a mixture of settlements lasting long periods, but not being fully stable and permanent. The middle of the period seems to be marked by the abandonment of both farms and hill forts. However, there is also continuity between this period and the Roman occupation. The Wyche Cutting, a pass through the Malvern hills, was in use the Iron Age as part of the salt route from Droitwich to South Wales. A 19th-century discovery of over two hundred metal money bars near the Wyche cutting has been said to suggest that the Malvern area had been inhabited by the La T√®ne people around 250 BC. Evidence of Iron Age salt production has been found at Droitwich itself. A pottery industry exporting into the surrounding area began in the Malvern area, continuing into the Middle Ages. Roman A period of client state relations, with tributes and political arrangements being made between the Roman Empire and Celtic Britons preceded the invasion. Caesar attempted it and Augustus planned to the same. Emperor Claudius successfully conquered Britain in a campaign starting in 43AD. Excavations at Midsummer Hill fort, Bredon Hill, Conderton Camp and Croft Ambrey all show evidence of violent destruction around the year 48 AD. This may suggest that British Camp was also abandoned or destroyed around the same time. Worcestershire was quickly behind Roman front lines. This means that there is little evidence of Roman military presence in the county, excepting some ten small road defences, such as one near Kempsey that appears to have belonged to the Roman Second Legion Augusta, headquartered at Isca Augusta, Caerleon in South Wales. There are also bridge remains over the Severn near Kempsey which have been attributed to the Romans. Two forts have been found at Dodderhill next to the Droitwich salt workings. A villa or other high-profile building with mosaics has also been found here in 1847 during the construction of the canal and railway. There is evidence for Roman industrial production such as iron works in Worcester, but no sign of municipal buildings, although a small defended site has been detected, perhaps to guard the river crossing. Excavations at Kings Norton found signs of a small Romano-British settlement, including kilns for pottery manufacture, and more recently Roman pottery and a Roman ditch at Parsons Hill, near Icknield Street. Worcestershire as a whole does not seem to have been prominent in the villa system, except in its south eastern corner, near the Cotswolds, where Romanised agriculture was deeply established. Worcestershire was also not on the network of major Roman roads, although a number of roads have been detected. Anglo-Saxon The Roman administrative system appears to have disappeared swiftly after the withdrawal of their troops. However, Worcestershire probably remained Romano-British in cultural, linguistic and religious terms. There is little archaeological evidence. There appears to have been farming activity in Worcester, such as a few farmhouses and evidence for grazing at Deansway. There is evidence that St Helen's Church in Worcester could have had a British origin. Salt workings in Droitwich appear to have continued. =Kingdom of the Hwicce= The conquest of the area by Anglo- Saxons appears to have been relatively late. Gloucester and Bath were taken around 577 by the West Saxons at the Battle of Deorham. In 613, the Battle of Chester pushed the Welsh beyond the River Dee. In these early years, it is possible that very minor kingdoms or fiefdoms were established, for instance of the Weorgoran, from which it is believed Worcester takes its name. The area now known as Worcestershire was part of the early English kingdom of the Hwicce, which was quickly made subordinate to Mercia. The exact boundaries of their kingdom are uncertain, but it is likely that they coincided with those of the old Diocese of Worcester. The kingdom would, therefore, have included Worcestershire except for its northwestern tip. The toponym Hwicce survives in Worcestershire in the names of Wichenford, Wychbury Hill and Droitwich. By the time that the Hwiccan Diocese was established, the Kingdom was subordinate to Mercia. =Diocese of Worcester= The diocese was founded in 679‚Äì680, and early bishops bore the title Episcopus Hwicciorum. The diocese seems to have benefited in the 8th century from the support of the kings of Mercia. Through royal support the bishopric was able to gradually extend its control over prominent minsters. Initially, these were under the control of Hwiccan royals, as family property. This appears to have been gradually transferred to the control of the Bishopric, under the sponsorship of the Mercian kings, the process driven by the self-interest of the Mercian monarchy. As well as undermining local rivals through this process, the Mercian kings also derived revenue from church lands in this period. Consequently, in the 9th century, the bishopric of Worcester can be seen to be the most powerful ecclesiastical power in Mercia during this time. From this position the church was able to use its great wealth to buy privileges from the kings of Mercia. Later in the period it was from Mercia, in particular Worcester, that King Alfred began to recruit priests and monks with whom to rebuild the church in Wessex during the 880s (Asser, ch. 77). It has been argued that these priests brought with them a new attitude towards the church's place within society and its relationship with the monarchy. Consequently, from the bishopric of Worcester there developed a new ecclesiastical ideology that would become the accepted Anglo- Saxon church. The chaos of the period 900‚Äì1060 led to the loss of ecclesiastical lands, through leases and loss of records. Leases were often made for three lifetimes, but tended to become permanent arrangements. The result was that by Domesday, some 45% of the diocese's church lands were held by tenants under leases. Oswald and Eadnoth Worcester was a centre of monastic learning and church power. Oswald of Worcester was an important reformer, appointed Bishop in 961, jointly with York. The last Anglo-Saxon Bishop of Worcester, Wulfstan, or St Wulstan, was also an important reformer, and stayed in post until his death in 1095. =Alfred and Edward= Worcestershire was absorbed into the unified Kingdom of England in 927, when it was also first constituted as a county. It was a separate ealdormanship briefly in the 10th century before forming part of the Earldom of Mercia in the 11th century. In the years leading up to the Norman conquest in 1066, the Church, including the Priory Cathedral, Evesham Abbey, Pershore Abbey, Fladbury, Malvern Priory and other religious houses, increasingly dominated the county. During King Alfred's reign, the earls of Mercia fortified Worcester \\"for the protection of all the people\\" at the request of Bishop Werfrith. It appears that maintenance of the defences was to be paid for by the townspeople. A unique document detailing this and privileges granted to the church also outlines the existence of Worcester's market and borough court, differentiation between church and market quarters within the city, as well as the role of the King in relation to the roads. Worcester's fortifications would most likely have established the line of the wall that was extant until the 1600s, perhaps excepting the south-east area near the former castle (see Worcester city walls). It is referred to as a wall by contemporaries, so may have been of stone. Worcester became the focus of tax resistance against the Danish Harthacanute. Two huscarls were killed in May 1041 while attempting to collect taxes for the expanded navy, after being driven into the priory, where they were murdered. A military force was sent to deal with the non-payment, while the townspeople attempted to defend themselves by moving to and occupying the island of Bevere, two miles up the river, where they were then besieged. After Harthacnut's men had sacked the city and set it alight, agreement was reached. The last Anglo-Saxon sheriff of the county was Cyneweard of Laughern. Medieval During the Middle Ages, much of the county's economy was based on the wool trade, and many areas of its dense forests, such as Feckenham Forest, Horewell Forest, Ombersley, Wyre Forest and Malvern Chase, were royal hunting grounds. Droitwich Spa, being situated on large deposits of salt, was a centre of salt production from Roman times, with one of the principal Roman roads running through the town. Farming in the early Middle Ages tended to increase production through expanding the area of land cultivated, particularly from the forested and waste areas. Surplus production was quite limited, especially after feudal dues were given or paid, leaving peasant farmers making only slightly more than subsistence levels in most of the county. Poor harvests in 1315, 1316 and 1322 pushed food prices up and probably weakened the population's resistance to disease. The Black Death arrived in Worcestershire in 1348‚Äì9. Outbreaks in 1361, 1369 and 1375 together reduced the population by around a third, as in other parts of England. Some villages were abandoned entirely, sometimes leaving churches alone with no supporting settlement. The Priory Cathedral was a major landowner and economic force, both in Worcester and the county. The Church and other monastic communities together controlled more than half of the land in Worcestershire, a particularly high proportion. The Priory's properties for instance included the priory manor of Bromsgrove after it was donated by Henry III. It was a centre of learning and provided schooling. It was associated with hospitals. The Church received a portion of local taxations and ecclesiastical law applied to Christian morals and could result in punishments. It had close political associations with leading gentry and aristocracy. As such, Worcester's Cathedral had a central role in the medieval life of the city and county. In the early medieval period, as the settled areas of the country expanded into the more wooded areas in the north and west, the church was able to increase its share of the wealth of Worcestershire, as it dominated the newly settled areas that brought in new income, such as settlements at Kempsey, Wick Episcopi, Hanbury, Hartlebury, Wolverley and Inkberrow. The Cathedral was one of a number of religious institutions in Worcester. Rivalry between the different religious orders sometimes resulted in disorder, including on occasion, removing dead bodies when the right to bury a prominent person was disputed. Sponsorship of the differing orders also reflected family interests, with particular families having strong associations with specific orders. This was also true in the county as a whole. The Droitwich salt-industry was very important at the time of the Domesday Survey, Bromsgrove alone sending 300 cartloads of wood yearly to the salt-works. In the 13th and 14th centuries Bordesley monastery and the abbeys of Evesham and Pershore exported wool to the Florentine and Flemish markets. Coal and iron were mined at Dudley from the 13th century. =Norman Conquest= The first Norman Sheriff of Worcestershire, Urse d'Abetot oversaw the construction of a new castle at Worcester, although nothing now remains of the castle. Worcester Castle was in place by 1069, its outer bailey built on land that had previously been the cemetery for the monks of the Worcester cathedral chapter. The motte of the castle overlooked the river, just south of the cathedral. Worcester's Bishop Wulfstan was the last Anglo-Saxon bishop in England. At the time of the Domesday Survey more than half Worcestershire was in the hands of the church. The church of Worcester held the triple hundred of Op.waldslow, with such privileges as to exclude the sheriff's jurisdiction entirely, the profits of all the local courts accruing to the bishop, whose bailiffs in 1276 claimed to hold his hundred outside Worcester, at Dryhurst, and at Wimbornlrcc. The two hundreds owned by the church of Westminster, and that owned by Pershore, had in the 13th century been combined to form the hundred of Pershore, while the hundred of Evesham owned by Evesham Abbey had been converted into Blackenhurst hundred; and the irregular boundaries and outlying portions of these hundreds are explained by their having been formed out of the scattered endowments of their ecclesiastical owners. Of the remaining Domesday hundreds, Came, Clent, Cresselaw and Esch had been combined to form the hundred of Halfshire by the 13th century, while Doddingtree remained unchanged. The shire-court was held at Worcester. The vast possessions of the church prevented the growth of a great territorial aristocracy in Worcestershire, and Dudley Castle, which passed from William Fitz-Ansculf to the families of Paynel and Somen, was the sole residence of a feudal baron. The Domesday fief of Urse d'Abitot the sheriff, founder of Worcester Castle, and of his brother Robert le Despenser passed in the 12th century to the Beauchamps, who owned Elmley and Hanley Castles. The possessions of William Fitz Osbern in Doddingtree hundred and the Teme valley fell to the crown after his rebellion in 1074 and passed to the Mortimers. Hanley Castle and Malvern Chase were granted by Henry III. to Gilbert de Clare, with exemption from the sheriff's jurisdiction. =King Stephen= The nineteen-year conflict between King Stephen and Empress Matilda over the English crown had impacts in Worcestershire. Matilda's brother was the Earl of Gloucester, placing Worcester close to one of her most powerful allies. As war broke out in 1138, Stephen attacked Dudley Castle, held by Ralf Pagenal, allied to the Empress. Stephen ravaged the surrounding countryside but could not take the castle. In Easter 1139, Stephen made a royal visit to Worcester and made offerings at the Cathedral. Around this time he also created the Earldom of Worcester, giving the title to Waleran de Beaumont, a close ally. In 1140, Empress Matilda's allies were in Gloucester, while she was under siege in Oxford. Rumours of an imminent attack on Worcester by Matilda's allies drove Worcester's citizens to take refuge in the Cathedral. The attack came in November. Worcester's citizens repulsed the attack at the castle, but houses were burnt, prisoners taken for ransom and livestock stolen. Waleran attacked Sudeley Castle and Tewkesbury in revenge. Miles of Gloucester, the Sheriff, sided with the Empress. He was rewarded with the title of Earl of Hereford. Stephen made the grandson of Urse d'Abitot William de Beauchamp Sheriff in his place. He was put in charge of Worcester's castle in 1145, and Waleran went on a pilgrimage to Palestine. In 1150, Waleran sided with Matilda and defended Worcester against attack by Stephen. Worcester was burnt and plundered, this time by King Stephen, when he took the city. The war came to an end in 1153, with Stephen agreeing that Matilda's heir would succeed him, in return for peace. =Henry II= Henry II restored his authority in the Marches early after his coronation, particularly acting against Roger, Earl of Hereford and Hugh de Mortimer in Shropshire. He visited Worcester and was ceremonially crowned (that is, wore his crown in public) twice in the city. At Easter 1158, one of these occasions, he held a Royal Council at the city. Henry II implemented a number of administrative and legal reforms. He reorganised the English judicial system, implementing circuits, where judges would visit courts in turn. Worcestershire, Shrophsire, Herefordshire and Gloucestershire formed one of these. Henry II's dispute with Thomas Becket reached Worcester as the Bishop Roger attempted to support Becket and the independence of the Church. He wrote to the King to intercede on behalf of Becket after his exile, which provoked Henry to instruct him to keep away from Becket in his exile. Roger ignored the instruction, and was in turn exiled. He remained in exile, despite attempts by the Pope to reconcile him with Henry, and eventually was sent to Rome by the King after Becket's murder to attempt to convince the Pope that he was not involved. =Richard I= Worcester received its first royal charter from Richard I in 1189. This set out the annual payment made to the Crown as ¬£24 per annum, and set out that the city would deal directly with the Crown's Exchequer, rather than through the county sheriff, who would no longer have general jurisdiction over the city. =King John= John's tomb, Worcester Cathedral King John made eleven visits to Worcester, including at his first Easter as King in 1200. Wulfstan was made a saint in 1203, and John visited his shrine in 1207. He appears to have developed an attachment to Wulfstan's cult because he appeared to support the authority of kings. However, despite John's apparent attachment to the city, its charter was not renewed, which allowed him to levy increasing and arbitrary taxation (tallage) on Worcester. John attempted to claim the right to appoint English bishops, which led him into a long dispute with the Pope. Bishop Mauger of Worcester was appointed by the Pope to enforce his Interdict, alongside the Bishops of London and Ely. He was forced into exile and his possessions confiscated as a result. John spent Christmas 1214 at Worcester, During his disputes with the Barons over the administration of justice, before returning to London where discussions leading to Magna Carta began. In 1216, the barons asked the French Dauphin to depose John. This brought conflict to Worcestershire, where the county 's leaders organised against him, and allowed William Marshall, son of the Earl of Pembroke, who was loyal to John, to take possession of Worcester as governor. Ranulph, Earl of Chester attacked the city, took the castle and ransacked the Cathedral, where the garrison had attempted to take shelter. Marshal was warned of the attack by his father, and was able to escape. The priory was fined for protecting the rebels and were forced to melt down the treasures used to adorn St Wulfstan's tomb. The city of Worcester was fined ¬£100 for its role, a fine which he could impose due to the lack of a city charter. John was buried in the cathedral near Wulfstan's altar after he died. =The diocese and Worcester's Jewry= Worcester had a small Jewish population by the late 12th century. It was one of a number of places allowed to keep records of debts, in an official locked chest known as an archa. (An archa or arca (plural archae/arcae) was a municipal chest in which deeds were preserved.) Jewish life probably centred around what is now Copenhagen Street. The diocese was notably hostile to the Jewish community in Worcester. Peter of Blois was commissioned by a Bishop of Worcester, probably John of Coutances, to write a significant anti-Judaic treatise Against the Perfidy of Jews around 1190., William de Blois, as Bishop of Worcester, imposed particularly strict rules on Jews within the diocese in 1219. As elsewhere in England, Jews were officially compelled to wear square white badges, supposedly representing tabulae. In most places, this requirement was relinquished as long as fines were paid. In addition to enforcing the church laws on wearing badges, Blois tried to impose additional restrictions on usury, and wrote to Pope Gregory in 1229 to ask for better enforcement and further, harsher measures. In response, the Papacy demanded that Christians be prevented from working in Jewish homes, \\"lest temporal profit be preferred to the zeal of Christ\\", and enforcement of the wearing of badges. =Henry III= Henry III made a gift of the manor of Bromsgrove to Worcester Priory, to support its memorial of his father King John. A national assembly of Jewish notables was summoned to Worcester by the Crown in 1240 to assess their wealth for taxation; at which Henry III \\"squeezed the largest tallage of the thirteenth century from his Jewish subjects\\". Henry III was embroiled in disputes with his Barons for a great deal of his reign. In the 1260s, this broke out into war. In 1263 Worcester's Jewish residents were attacked by a baronial force led by Robert Earl Ferrers and Henry de Montfort. Most were killed. Ferrers used this opportunity to remove the titles to his debts by taking the archae. The massacre in Worcester was part of a wider campaign by the De Montforts and their allies in the run-up to the Second Barons' War, aimed at undermining Henry III. A massacre of London's Jewry also took place during the war. Worcestershire was the site of the Battle of Evesham in which Simon de Montfort was killed on 4 August 1265, effectively ending any hope for his allies of winning the war. A few years later, in 1275, the Jews that were still living in Worcester were forced to move to Hereford, as they were expelled from all towns under the jurisdiction of the queen mother. =Worcestershire in Parliament= As early as 1295 Worcestershire was represented by sixteen members in parliament, returning two knights for the shire and two burgesses each for the city of Worcester and the boroughs of Bromsgrove, Droitwich, Dudley, Evesham, Kidderminster and Pershore. With the exception of Droitwich, however, which was represented until 1311 and again recovered representation in 1554, the boroughs ceased to make returns. Evesham was re-enfranchised in 1604, and in 1606 Bewdley returned one member. Under the Reform Act of 1832 the county returned four members in two divisions; Droitwich lost one member; Dudley and Kidderminster were re-enfranchised, returning one member each. In 1867 Evesham lost one member. Early modern =Industrial and agricultural change= In the 16th century, the Worcestershire clothing industry gave employment to 8000 people. The clothing industry declined in the 17th century, but the silk-manufacture later replaced it at Kidderminster and Blockley. Henry VIII confined cloth making to Bromsgrove, Kidderminster, Droitwich, Evesham and Worcester. Rural production of cloth had been spurred by rural poverty and the need to supplement incomes. Trade in Worcester and the cloth trade in Kidderminster was still controlled by guilds. Fulling (cleaning new cloth) around Worcester and dyeing in the Teme valley, for instance in Tenbury and Clifton, were major employers. Rope making was prominent around Bromsgrove. However, tanning was probably the largest single industry across the county, concentrated near rivers and streams in the north and west of the county. Glassmaking was first established in Stourbridge in the early 1600s, by Hugeonot emigres. Sir Robert Mansell who had obtained a national monopoly on glass production was pivotal in using the local clay to make glass pots, and greatly expanded the local industry, which began manufacturing window panes as well as bottles and pots. Stourbridge glass manufacturers used coal for fuel, which was important as woodlands were increasingly under pressure, and was needed for shipbuilding as well as fuel. The northern part of the county was already known for metalwork, but was still dependent on small furnaces powered by hand bellows for iron production until shortly before the civil war, when charcoal furnaces using water powered bellows began to be introduced. Smithies were generally owned by landowners and leased to smiths, who were not organised into guilds, unlike their counterparts in Coventry. This freedom from price and production control may in part explain the industry's sudden growth in the seventeenth century, which caused rivalry with guilds in London who attempted to stop the flow of Midlands goods into their markets. The greatest benefits of the trade accrued to ironmasters who purchased goods from the local producers for sale onwards. Nailmaking also established itself in the northern parts of the county, such as Bromsgrove, Stourbridge and Dudley. Like other metal trades, it served as a way to supplement otherwise low rural incomes, and then replaced other labouring work for many. It grew in part because of the access that the Severn river gave to national and international markets, alongside the local production of iron. Again the nailmasters, who resold nails into the markets beyond the county gained the most from this trade, which even in this period was low paid and exploited. The period also saw many changes to agriculture. For instance, tobacco was grown in Worcestershire in the Eckington and Evesham areas. There were 17 growers in 1627, when it was banned after pressure from colonial producers. Tobacco continued to be grown illegally through most of the rest of the century. The potato, on the other hand, while introduced to the country, was not widely cultivated. Hops may also have been introduced to Worcestershire around this period. Flax and hemp, vital to the cloth trade, were grown, as was woad, for dyeing. The county grew extensive fruit crops, especially apples and pears, but also plums, cherries, other soft fruits and vines. Cider and perry production also thrived. Mulberries were encouraged by James I and Charles II as a prelude to introducing a silk industry, supporting silk-manufacture later established at Kidderminster and Blockley. Market gardening also developed in the period, especially in the Evesham area., =Reformation= Worcester Priory came to an end with King Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries. Shortly beforehand, in 1535, the prior William More resigned, and was replaced by Henry Holbeach. More had a reputation for fine living, although his standards seem in line with other senior ecclesiasts of the time. However, there certainly were problems with the administration of the priory, including divisions within the community. The Protestant Hugh Latimer was bishop from 1535, and preached for reform and iconoclasm. He resigned as bishop in 1539, as a result of a theological turn by Henry VIII towards Roman Catholicism, in the Six Articles. John Bell, a moderate reformer, was bishop from 1539‚Äì1543, during the period of the priory's dissolution. In the early 16th century, Worcester had around 40 monks. This declined slightly in the years immediately before 1540, as recruitment seems to have halted. There were 35 Benedictine monks plus the Prior Holbeach at the time of dissolution, probably 16 January 1540; eleven were immediately given pensions, while the remainder became secular canons in the new Royal College. Holbeach was re-appointed as the first Dean. A further five former monks were pensioned from the college in July 1540. The abolition of the monasteries caused a major reorganisation of the educational system for young people, mostly sons of gentry, who were given Latin and grammar schooling through monastic schools up until this point. The Royal Grammar School, Worcester claims descent from one of these. King Henry set up replacement grammar schools, often still provided in close association with the Church. King's School, Worcester is one of these. The former monastic library of Worcester Priory contained a considerable number of manuscripts which are, among other libraries, now scattered over Cambridge, London (British Library), Oxford Bodleian, and the Cathedral library at Worcester of today. Remains of the priory dating from the 12th and 13th centuries can still be seen. John Bell's successor as Bishop, Nicholas Heath, was religiously much more conservative and Catholic. The records from the dissolution give detail about other religious houses in Worcestershire. Although Roman Catholicism was officially abolished, a number of Worcestershire's aristocratic families remained Catholic. Several were involved in the Gunpowder Plot in 1604. Some Worcestershire houses have priest holes that survive from the 16th and 17th centuries (for example Harvington Hall has seven). See 366‚Äì369 (link to preview) The reformation also brought change to rural customs, feasts and fairs, which became gradually more detached from religious significance. As Puritanism rose as a social force in the 1620s and 30s, village sports and activities such as Maypole and Morris dancing came under attack, for instance from legislation in the 1620s. Worcester raised funds to keep players out of the city in 1632 and 1634. These activities did however gain a revival after the restoration. =Gunpowder Plot= Robert Wintour and other conspirators devised a plan to blow up the new Scottish Protestant King James I at the Wintour's home at Huddington Court. Robert Catesby, the main figure behind the Gunpowder Plot, was from Northampton, but most of the plotters were from Worcestershire's Catholic families. =Charles I= After 1629, Charles I attempted to rule without Parliament. This forced him to raise taxes and other revenues, which had a number of impacts on Worcestershire. The sale of royal lands, particularly forests, led to attempts to enclose Malvern Chase and the more successful sale of Feckenham Forest in the 1630s, which in both cases had led to rioting as well as the displacement of the rural poor that had depended on the use of these Royal lands as effectively common land, with long- established although informal usage rights.; Other local grievances against the Crown included action to suppress profitable tobacco production, which was well established in the Vale of Evesham. Taxes on imports of goods known as 'tonnage and poundage' were imposed, which reduced the profitability of trade and created opposition in urban centres including Worcester. Similarly, the Ship Money taxation levied in 1636 fell heavily on Worcester, which was the sixteenth highest paying city in England. Puritans including Richard Baxter noted the mounting opposition to Royal policies within the county. The unpopularity of these Royalist policies stemmed from the perception that Charles I was attempting to establish a more authoritarian, non-Parliamentary kind of monarchy. Charles I's religious policies also provoked suspicion in Worcestershire. Although the county had a Catholic minority among its aristocratic families, the vast majority of the population was firmly Anglican, with a growing group of more radical Protestants in its towns. They had increasing social influence, for instance about public morality and observance of the Sabbath. Increased interest in religious doctrine led to several Worcestershire towns funding lecturers to deliver sermons, including Baxter in Kidderminster. Worcestershire produced some other notable Puritan figures, including Edward Winslow, who migrated to new England with the Pilgrim Fathers. Charles' apparent Catholic sympathies, such as the reforms of William Laud that reintroduced many of the trappings of Catholicism back into the Church of England, would have been viewed with suspicion by many. In Worcester, Roger Mainwaring, as Dean, reintroduced vestments and constructed a marble altar. In the early 1640s, stories of massacres of Protestants in Ireland helped lead to rumours of Catholic plots than spread through the county leading to anti-Catholic riots in Bewdley in late 1641, and instructions to local militias to guard against conspiracies in the following months. =Civil War= Worcestershire was under Royalist control during most of the first civil war. Like many parts of England, there was little enthusiasm for either side, and the initial instincts of many was to try to avoid conflict. Different parts of the county had different sympathies, for instance Evesham was notably Parliamentarian, and Kidderminster also had a strong Parliamentarian contingent. The city of Worcester equivocated about whether to support the Parliamentary cause before the outbreak of civil war in 1642, but eventually sided with Parliament. It was however soon under Royalist occupation, as was the rest of the county. In 1642 the first major skirmish of the Civil War, the Battle of Powick Bridge, on the River Teme close to Worcester, occurred when a cavalry troop of about 1,000 Royalists commanded by Prince Rupert, a German nephew of the King and one of the outstanding cavalry commanders of the war, defeated a Parliamentary cavalry detachment under the command of Colonel John Brown. The Cathedral was used to store arms during the war, possibly as early as September 1642. While Worcester declared itself for Parliament, it was swiftly occupied by the Royalists, who were using the building to store munitions when Essex briefly retook the city after the Powick Bridge skirmish on its outskirts. Parliamentary troops then ransacked the Cathedral building. Stained glass was smashed and the organ destroyed, along with library books and monuments. The See was abolished during the Commonwealth and the Protectorate, approximately 1646‚Äì60. Worcester was one of three garrison towns in the county and had to bear the expense of sustaining and billeting a large number of Royalist troops. During the Royalist occupation, the suburbs were destroyed to make defence easier. Responsibility for maintenance of defences was transferred to the military command. High taxation was imposed, and many male residents impressed into the army. The same pressures created great strain on the county as a whole, as it had to sustain a large, unproductive force drawn out of its productive labour. Taxation, requisitioning by armies and cross-border raids caused great deprivations, made worse by the proximity of Worcestershire to Parliamentary forces to the north around Birmingham, to the east in Warwickshire, and at certain times to the south in Bristol and Gloucestershire.; on strategic position see and Nevertheless, the county was strategically vital to the Royalists, as a bridge from Wales and Ireland back to their headquarters in Oxford. Worcestershire also provided the Royalists with industrial capacity to produce armaments and munitions. Bands of Clubmen formed in west Worcestershire in the later part of the first war, with the objective of keeping both armies and their demands away from the rural civilian population, to resist despoilation and requisitioning. There was also a vein of resentment towards the prominent role given many Catholics in the county. The Clubmen's Woodbury Hill proclamation stated that they would not obey any Papist or Papist Recusant, \\"nor ought [they] ‚Ä¶ be trusted in any office of state, justice, or judicature\\". As Royalist power collapsed in May 1646, Worcester was placed under siege. Worcester had around 5,000 civilians, together with a Royalist garrison of around 1,500 men, facing a 2,500‚Äì5,000 strong force of the New Model Army. Worcester finally surrendered on 23 July, bringing the first civil war to a close in Worcestershire. In 1651 a Scottish army marched south along the west coast in support of Charles II's attempt to regain the Crown and entered the county. The 16,000 Scottish force caused Worcester's council to vote to surrender as it approached, fearing further violence and destruction. The Parliamentary garrison decided to withdraw to Evesham in the face of the overwhelming numbers against them. The Scots were billeted in and around the Worcester, again at great expense and causing new anxiety for the residents. The Scots were joined by very limited local forces, including a company of 60 men under John Talbot. The Battle of Worcester (3 September 1651), took place in the fields a little to the west and south of the city, near the village of Powick. Charles II was easily defeated by Cromwell's forces of 30,000 men. Charles II returned to his headquarters in what is now known as King Charles House in the Cornmarket, before fleeing in disguise with Talbot's help to Boscobel House in Shropshire, from where he eventually escaped to France. Parliamentary forces ransacked the city, causing over ¬£70,000 of damage according to the city council. Scottish troops fleeing capture were attacked and killed in local skirmishes, while the vast majority were pressed into forced labour in the east of England or new world. =The Restoration= Religion, dissenters and Catholicism At the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, Worcester's cathedral was in considerable disrepair. Only three canons were alive from the period before the Bishopric's abolition in 1649. The new treasurer Barnabas Oley estimated the cost of restoring the damage to the cathedral buildings at over ¬£16,000. Between 1660 and 1662, Parliament supported a very broad toleration of views in the Church of England, and did not seek to expel ministers except those with most radical religious views. This ended in 1662, when the Act of Uniformity required ministers to accept the Church of England prayer book. Around 2,000 Anglican ministers from the Commonwealth period resigned from the Church of England, including Richard Baxter of Kidderminster, who had also acted as chaplain to Parliamentary troops. In Bromsgrove, John Spilsbury, previously a fellow of Magdalen College, was removed after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, and left the Church of England by refusing to conform to the Act of Uniformity See footnote Thomas Hall, at King's Norton, was also expelled. Spilsbury was confined to his house, banished from the county and finally imprisoned for his non-conformism.; see also Spilsbury's son John led a dissenting congregation in Kidderminster, and in turn, his son Francis Spilsbury became a minister at Salters' Hall in London. At the other end of the religious spectrum, many of the aristocratic families of Worcestershire were Catholics, and were also unable to fully participate in public life. Catholic worship was illegal, however an average of eight priests operated in the county during the seventeenth century. In 1678, during anti-Catholic panic spread after the exposure of an alleged \\"Popish Plot\\" against Charles II, Father John Wall who was based at Harvington Hall, was arrested at Rushock Court and imprisoned at Worcester Castle. Although there was little evidence against him, he was hanged, drawn and quartered, the last Catholic to be executed for his faith in the United Kingdom. Final years of Charles II Charles II's last years were dominated by his attempts to face down demands from the Whigs to prevent the succession to the throne of a Catholic, Charles' brother James being next in line. To this end, Charles dissolved the 1681 Parliament, which was debating an Exclusion Bill, and then attempted to limit the ability of towns and cities to elect MPs that were unsympathetic to his views. The mechanism for this was the alteration of town charters, to allow the crown to dismiss key officials, and to limit the Parliamentary franchise to the same officials. In 1684, the previous royal charters of Evesham and Worcester were withdrawn, and Evesham given a new restricted franchise along these lines. King James II issued a new Charter to Worcester which was less restrictive than Evesham's but allowed him to dismiss council officials. =King James II and the Glorious Revolution= Catholic worship became more open during James II's rule, and a chapel was established in Worcester near Foregate around 1685. Anti-Catholic riots in the city were narrowly prevented in 1686 outside a private house used for Catholic worship. In 1688, King James II attempted to remove restrictions on Catholic in public life. These moves were unpopular in Worcestershire as elsewhere. As James II canvassed his support with local officials, those in Worcester were evasive in the responses. By October, the King was forced to placate public disquiet, and restored the rights of cities like Worcester, with the result that the local council dismissed the Mayor and reinstated the previous one. The same council recorded its support for the Prince of Orange in December. In 1689, James visited Worcester as guest of Bishop Thomas as he toured the country. The town council accompanied him on his request to visit the new Catholic chapel, but reportedly refused to enter it. Bishop Thomas was not among the seven Bishops that objected to King James' Declaration of Indulgence, which aimed at rehabilitating Catholics into public life, along with Protestants outside of the Church of England, but supported their stance. The trial of the Bishops led to James being deposed and replaced by William of Orange. Bishop Thomas was among those who refused to give an oath of allegiance to the new King, on the principle that a regency should govern rather than a new King, while James was alive. A number of other Worcester clergy took the same stance of loyalty to the Stuarts and were removed from the Church as Non-Jurors. John Somers, the lawyer who represented the seven Bishops, represented Worcester in the Convention Parliament that confirmed William as King. During Charles II and James II's reigns, strict controls on the press had been maintained. These broke down during the 1689 revolution and were removed in 1695. Around 1690 the Worcester Post-Man appears to have been established, from which the Berrow's Journal claims descent. Eighteenth century While Worcestershire might have been expected to have significant Jacobin sympathies, from its Catholic families and connections with the Stuarts, these do not have appeared to have resulted in much political or religious expression other than the refusal of a significant minority of Church of England clergy to swear allegiance to William of Orange. However, some sign of such views can perhaps be detected in the formation of a Whig Constitution Club in Worcester. Worcester's Bishop William Lloyd was a prominent Whig. In 1710, Henry Sacheverell, a Tory with conservative religious views, who had imprisoned for preaching against the tolerance of dissenters, travelled through Worcester on his way to Shropshire. Bishop Lloyd attempted to prevent the ringing of church bells in his honour by Worcester's residents. When a group of supporters broke into St Nicholas' Church, they found the bells without clappers and resorted to bashing them with anything iron. This produced a discordant noise, and turned the attempt to greet Sacheverell with honour into something of a farce. Worcestershire's landed classes prosperity is attested to by the construction of great houses in this period, which stands in contrast to the decades immediately after the Civil War. Examples include Croome Court, whose gardens were designed by Capability Brown; Hagley Hall; and Hanbury Hall. Church building also reflected increased wealth, such as the Baroque chapel at Great Witley. Nineteenth century In the nineteenth century, Worcester was a centre for the manufacture of gloves; the town of Kidderminster became a centre for carpet manufacture, and Redditch specialised in the manufacture of needles, springs and hooks. Worcestershire's Dudley exclave was part of the Black Country which was at the heart of the industrial revolution's iron and coal industries. Bromsgrove and Dudley were both centres of nail making. The first Catholic chapel in Worcester since James II's reign was opened in 1829, shortly after the Sacramental Test Act 1828 and other legislation that removed most of the legal discrimination against Catholics. Malvern was one of the centres of the 19th-century rise in English spa towns due to Malvern water being believed to be very pure, containing \\"nothing at all\\". Bottled Waters of the World. Retrieved 9 August 2009 Twentieth century In 1974 the county was merged with Herefordshire to form a large single administrative county of Hereford and Worcester which in 1998 was reverted to the original historical counties. Some changes in borders occurred with some areas such as Halesowen, Stourbridge, and the exclave of Dudley, which used to be part of northern Worcestershire becoming part of West Midlands metropolitan county. Yardley had already been made part of Birmingham in the county of Warwickshire. The post-1998 county, therefore, does not correspond exactly to the pre-1974 boundaries.

A hyperbolic sector in standard position has a = 1 and b > 1 . Hyperbolic sectors are the basis for the hyperbolic functions. Area The area of a hyperbolic sector in standard position is ln b .

Hyperbolic triangle Hyperbolic triangle (yellow) and hyperbolic sector (red) corresponding to hyperbolic angle u, to the rectangular hyperbola (equation y = 1/x). The legs of the triangle are times the hyperbolic cosine and sine functions. When in standard position, a hyperbolic sector determines a hyperbolic triangle, the right triangle with one vertex at the origin, base on the diagonal ray y = x, and third vertex on the hyperbola :xy=1,\\\\, with the hypotenuse being the segment from the origin to the point (x, y) on the hyperbola. The length of the base of this triangle is :\\\\sqrt 2 \\\\cosh u,\\\\, and the altitude is :\\\\sqrt 2 \\\\sinh u,\\\\, where u is the appropriate hyperbolic angle.

Students of integral calculus know that f(x) = xp has an algebraic antiderivative except in the case p = ‚Äì1 corresponding to the quadrature of the hyperbola. The other cases are given by Cavalieri's quadrature formula. Whereas quadrature of the parabola had been accomplished by Archimedes in the third century BC (in The Quadrature of the Parabola), the hyperbolic quadrature required the invention in 1647 of a new function: Gregoire de Saint-Vincent addressed the problem of computing the areas bounded by a hyperbola. His findings led to the natural logarithm function, once called the hyperbolic logarithm since it is obtained by integrating, or finding the area, under the hyperbola.Martin Flashman The History of Logarithms from Humboldt State University Before 1748 and the publication of Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite, the natural logarithm was known in terms of the area of a hyperbolic sector. Leonhard Euler changed that when he introduced transcendental functions such as 10x. Euler identified e as the value of b producing a unit of area (under the hyperbola or in a hyperbolic sector in standard position). Then the natural logarithm could be recognized as the inverse function to the transcendental function ex. Hyperbolic geometry When Felix Klein wrote his book on non-Euclidean geometry in 1928, he provided a foundation for the subject by reference to projective geometry. To establish hyperbolic measure on a line, he noted that the area of a hyperbolic sector provided visual illustration of the concept.Felix Klein (1928) Vorlesungen √ºber Nicht-Euklidische Geometrie, p. 173, figure 113, Julius Springer, Berlin Hyperbolic sectors can also be drawn to the hyperbola y = \\\\sqrt{1 + x^2}.

History =Castel area= Due to its strategic location, settlement in the area of Mevasseret Zion goes back to antiquity. The Romans built a fortress there, known as Castellum. On the ruins of this fortress, the Crusaders built a castle, Castellum Belveer, of which no trace remains. Belveer is mentioned in a letter from Eraclius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, dated September 1187, in which he describes the slaughter of Christians \\"by the sword of Mafumetus the Unbeliever and his evil worshipper Saladin\\" and the Arab conquest of the town, which was renamed al- Qastal.Letters from the East: Crusaders, Pilgrims and Settlers in the 12th-13th Centuries, Keith Bate, Malcolm Barber, A.K.

In the 1948 Palestine War, battles took place here as Arabs and Jews fought for control of al-Qastal, which overlooked the main Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway. Al-Qastal exchanged hands several times in the course of the fighting. The tides turned when the Arab commander Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni was killed. Many of the Arabs left their positions to attend al- Husayni's funeral at the Al-Aqsa Mosque on Friday, April 9. That same day, al- Qastal fell to the Yishuv forces, virtually unopposed.Institute of Jerusalem Studies View of Maoz Zion from Castel National Park =Maoz Zion= Maoz Zion (\\"Stronghold of Zion\\") was established in 1951 to house new immigrants from Iraq, Kurdistan, North Africa and Iran who had been living in a ma'abara, or transit camp, at the foot of the Castel hill.

It is bounded by communes of Brescia, Borgosatollo, Flero and Poncarale. It is located 6 km south of Brescia. History Human settlements in the area date back to the Roman Empire (Roman tombstone near the Cascina Pontevica) and Lombards dominion. The first documented town was established in the 15th century; the locality was called Tregonzo or Tregoncio which derives from Latin Inter Gurgites. Under the Venetian Republic (15th and 18th century, the town was organized in the Quadra of Mairano in 1483, then it passed to the Quadra of Bagnolo. It was occupied by the army from Milan during the war of Ferrara. In the ephemeral Napoleonic Repubblica di Brescia (1797), the commune belonged to the Cantone della Garza Orientale. During the Napoleonic dominion, the commune was abolited: town was administrated by Brescia directly. In 1814, Austrians restored the municipality autonomy. In 1881 during an administrative reform of the Kingdom of Italy, the commune was renamed San Zeno Naviglio. In 1817, a bridge was constructed near the S√∂r√®c zone (1817). In 1866, the Brescia‚ÄìCremona railway was opened along with its railway station. In 1893, the railway construction opened a link to Piadena and Parma. After Second World War the population grew.

Time deposits differ to at call deposits, such as savings or checking accounts, which can be withdrawn at any time, without any notice or penalty. Deposits that require notice of withdrawal to be given are effectively time deposits, though they do not have a fixed maturity date. Unlike a certificate of deposit and bonds, a time deposit is generally not negotiable; it is not transferable by the depositor, so that depositors need to deal with the financial institution when they need to prematurely cash out of the deposit. Time deposits enable the bank to invest the funds in higher-earning financial products. In some countries, including the United States, time deposits are not subject to the banks‚Äô reserve requirements, on the basis that the funds cannot be withdrawn at short notice. In some countries, time deposits are guaranteed by the government or protected by deposit insurance. Interest Time deposits normally earn interest, which is normally fixed for the duration of the term and payable upon maturity, though some may be paid periodically during the term, especially with longer-term deposits. Generally, the longer the term and the larger the deposit amount the higher the interest rate that will be offered. The interest paid on a time deposit tends to be higher than on an at-call savings account, but tends to be lower than that of riskier products such as stocks or bonds. Some banks offer market-linked time deposit accounts which offer potentially higher returns while guaranteeing principal. At maturity At maturity, the principal can be either paid back to the depositor (usually by a deposit into a bank account designated by the depositor) or rolled over for another term. Interest may be paid into the same account as the principal or to another bank account or rolled over with the principal to the next term. The money deposited normally can be withdrawn before maturity, but a significant penalty will normally be payable.

It stars Mekhi Phifer, Julia Stiles, and Josh Hartnett. It was directed by Tim Blake Nelson and written by Brad Kaaya. It contains many different styles of music, ranging from rap to opera. It was filmed in Charleston, South Carolina in the spring of 1999. Originally intended for release for October 17, 1999, it was shelved following the Columbine High School massacre; O was finally released on August 31, 2001. Plot During a high school basketball game, Odin James (Mekhi Phifer) scores the basket that wins the game for his team. Later at an awards ceremony, the coach, Duke Goulding (Martin Sheen) presents the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award to Odin for his efforts, an award he shares with his teammate Michael Cassio (Andrew Keegan). In giving Odin the award, Duke passes over his son Hugo (Josh Hartnett), Odin's teammate and best friend. At a party celebrating the victory, Hugo plans with school outcast Roger Calhoun (Elden Henson) to go to the school's dean, Bob Brable (John Heard) and tell him that Odin raped his daughter, Desi (Julia Stiles), whom Odin has been dating. Hugo promises Roger that Desi will be his after Odin is out of the way, but Roger is only a pawn in Hugo's ultimate plan to destroy Odin. Later, in another game, Odin's team wins once again. At the celebration party, Hugo engineers a fight between Roger and a very drunk Michael, who is temporarily suspended from the team. Hugo tells Michael to ingratiate himself with Desi so that she will talk to Odin on his behalf. Soon afterward, Hugo tells Odin that Michael and Desi have been spending a lot of time together, and that she may be cheating on him. Odin doesn't believe this at first, but gradually comes to suspect them. Odin questions Desi, but she calms him down and he believes her. Nevertheless, the stress of the situation drives Odin to begin using drugs. Hugo manipulates his girlfriend Emily (Rain Phoenix) into stealing a scarf for him that Odin had given to Desi. Hugo, in turn, gives it to Michael in hopes that Odin will believe that Desi gave Michael the scarf, and so is cheating on him. Meanwhile, Odin and Desi are having sex at a motel, during which Odin sees an image of Michael on top of Desi in the mirror; angered, he becomes very rough with Desi, to the point that she cries out for him to stop, a plea he ignores as he continues to rape her. Afterward, they lie together staring in opposite directions. After Odin assaults another student during a game in a drug-fueled rage, Hugo tells him about the scarf, convincing him that Desi is cheating on him. Enraged, Odin vows to kill her; Hugo then promises to kill Michael. Hugo, with Odin and Roger, plans to kill Michael and Desi. Hugo and Roger attempt to kill Michael in a carjacking, but it does not go as planned: Roger and Michael struggle, Hugo hits Michael with a crowbar, knocking him unconscious. Roger shoots Michael in the leg, and then Hugo turns the gun on Roger and kills him after telling him that Desi is dead. Odin and Desi are in Desi's room talking and Odin is pretending to make up with her. They are making out on the bed when suddenly Odin attacks her; Desi fights back, but he finally strangles her to death. Emily rushes into the room and sees Desi's corpse; she soon finds out what Hugo has done. She begins telling Odin that Hugo told her to steal the scarf and exposes his plot, and Hugo fatally shoots her when she refuses to be quiet. Odin finally realizes that Hugo has been manipulating him the entire time, and demands to know why; Hugo refuses to answer. When the police arrive, Odin tells them what happened and commits suicide. As Hugo is taken into police custody, he says in voice over that he will have his day in the spotlight.

Asimov added a brief introduction to each story, explaining some aspect of the story's history and/or how it came to be written. Background In the introduction for the title story, Asimov explained that although pleased by the praise it had received, he disliked \\"being told, over and over again\\" that a story he had written at the age of 21 was his best. Asimov hoped that the collection would prove that \\"sheer practice [had] made me more proficient, technically, with each year\\". He chose successful stories not included before in any anthologies edited by Asimov himself.

In 1042 the see was moved to Crediton and the lands of the monastery were divided into two parts, one for the monastery and one (named Cuddenbeak) for the Bishop of Crediton. After the Norman Conquest a college of secular canons was established which is said to have been reconstituted in the time of Bishop Bartholomew (1161‚Äì1184) as a college of regular canons.Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; pp. 98-99 The present church replaces an Anglo-Saxon building which was the cathedral of the Bishops of Cornwall. The church is dedicated to St Germanus and soon after construction it became the cathedral for Cornwall in 926 AD, when King Athelstan appointed Conan as the bishop of Cornwall. The bishopric was to be short-lived, however, as it was transferred to Crediton in 1042 AD. A monastery grew alongside the church, and was reorganized by the Bishop of Exeter between 1161 and 1184 as an Augustinian priory. The priory church was rebuilt on a grand scale, with two western towers and a nave of 102 ft. The church was once called the Cathedral of Cornwall because it is where the bishop of the duchy would be. Interior view West doorway At the Dissolution of the Monasteries under King Henry VIII the priory was abolished and its buildings became a private house, home to the Eliot family, in whose hands the house remains. A number of the Eliot family are interred in the church. St Germans parish was once the largest in Cornwall. St Germans Priory is now managed by the Church of England and the St Germans Priory Trust. Architecture Some of the original Norman features remain, including the large arched western doorway which is particularly ornate and is carved from elvan quarried at Landrake.Sedding, Edmund H.

They are named for the fictional animal of the same name, although the animal's name is more commonly spelled jackalope. The band was formed in 2003 by noted Canadian industrial musician and producer Dave \\"Rave\\" Ogilvie, most famous for his studio work with such acts as Skinny Puppy, David Bowie, Nine Inch Nails, and Marilyn Manson. The band gained much popularity after playing the opening theme song to seasons 4‚Äì7 of the TV series Degrassi: The Next Generation. History =Beginnings and It Dreams= Jakalope began in 2003 as an open-concept project headed by Dave Ogilvie. His conceptual aim was towards a new musical genre rooted in industrial rock (for which Ogilvie is famed), but would be able to flow smoothly between searing rock and melodic pop. It was around this time that Ogilvie became acquainted with the vocal stylings of Katie B while she was working at Bryan Adams' The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver. The two of them had instant chemistry, and Katie took her position center stage as the front woman of Jakalope. Their debut album, It Dreams, was released in 2004, and spawned the hit singles and videos \\"Pretty Life\\", and \\"Feel It\\". The third single was \\"Go Away\\", but the video received little play on MuchMusic and was unsuccessful compared to the two previous singles. In 2005 It Dreams was released in Japan. For this album, the band collaborated with a large number of guest musicians, including Trent Reznor (who contributed production work, as well as song writing, and instrumentation), Kat Bjelland and members of Acid Polly Sloan, Monster Magnet and Malhavoc. The cover art for It Dreams received the Juno Award for Best CD/DVD Artwork Design of the Year in 2005, and was designed by artist Vincent Marcone. =Born 4= In early October 2005, the Orange Record Label confirmed that Jakalope would return to the studio in late October to record their next album, Born 4. The first single off the album, \\"Upside Down (And I Fall)\\", was released to radio in March 2006. There was some controversy with the release date constantly changing, from an initial date set for spring 2006. Due to undisclosed reasons the release date was postponed several times, until the release on October 3. Trent Reznor returned as co-producer and other guests on the second album include Allie Sheldan (Rio Bent), Thom D'arcy (Small Sins), Bob Pantella (Monster Magnet), Alex Lifeson (Rush), Jeremy Fisher and Bill Rieflin (Ministry, R.E.M., Married To Music). Vincent Marcone returned once more to do the CD design. Born 4 was released on June 7, 2006 in Japan, and on October 3 in Canada. It was later made available for purchase on iTunes in both the United States and Canada. =Katie B's departure and the arrival of Chrystal Leigh= In spring 2007, frontwoman Katie B. left the band to pursue a solo career. She summarizes her experience with Jakalope as a time where she \\"grew as a songwriter, a performer, an artist, and learned many a valuable lesson\\".ktrox.com The split was said to be amicable and there is no ill will between the two parties. The spot of lead singer was eventually filled by Chrystal Leigh, former lead singer for now-defunct Vancouver band The Perfect Strangers. She also fronted the Chrystal Leigh Band during a stint in Kelowna, and contributed supporting vocals to the song \\"Vertebrae\\" by Closing Iris. Of Chrystal, Ogilvie has said: \\"I was blown away by her personality, her voice, and the fact that she's a piano player. I was dying to have someone to collaborate with, who actually is a musician and not just a singer.\\"Quote taken from Jakalope's official bio on their official Myspace For the next few years, Jakalope slowly put together new material and searched for a new label. They still played the occasional show, such as playing at the 2009 Juno FestivalThe Juno Fest Schedule and released the occasional song via their Myspace. =Things That Go Jump in the Night= First, the band released two new songs, via their official Myspace, the first titled \\"Delicious\\" and the second, a cover of the Julee Cruise song, \\"Falling\\". Ogilvie announced that the album would be named Delicious. Another song, titled \\"Last Song\\", was released via the official Jakalope fansite. A remix of \\"Delicious\\" by Alkatraz was also released to their Myspace. In August 2009, Jakalope released yet another new song, titled \\"a.k.a. Cupcake\\",Jakalope releases a new song via YouTube through their YouTube account and announced that final recording for their second album had begun. In February 2010, the band announced that they had signed to 604 RecordsAnnouncement that the band joined 604 Records and soon after announced that filming of a video for a single titled \\"Witness\\" would be taking place the following week.announcement of new single's name In March 2010, the band announced via Twitter that the first single would be released at the end of March and the new album would be out by the end of May.Tentative announcement of single and album release dates On May 19, 2010, Jakalope posted three new songs on their MySpace page, \\"Witness\\", \\"Baby Blue\\" and \\"Combine\\", as well as a trailer for the music video for \\"Witness\\". On July 13, 2010, \\"Witness\\", the first single from the band's third album, was made available through the iTunes Store. The Kevvy Mental remix of \\"Witness\\" by Kevin James Maher was also made available for purchase.https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/witness/id379945449?i=379945456 A music video was later made for the song \\"Magnolia\\".

The relationship of a hyperbolic angle to a hyperbola parallels the relationship of an \\"ordinary\\" angle to a circle. The magnitude of the hyperbolic angle is the area of the corresponding sector of the hyperbola xy = 1. This hyperbola is rectangular with a semi-major axis of \\\\sqrt 2, analogous to the magnitude of a circular angle corresponding to the area of a circular sector in a circle with radius \\\\sqrt 2. Hyperbolic angle is used as the independent variable for the hyperbolic functions sinh, cosh, and tanh, because these functions may be premised on hyperbolic analogies to the corresponding circular trigonometric functions by regarding a hyperbolic angle as defining a hyperbolic triangle. The parameter thus becomes one of the most useful in the calculus of real variables. Definition Consider the rectangular hyperbola \\\\textstyle\\\\\\\\{(x,\\\\frac 1 x): x>0\\\\\\\\}, and (by convention) pay particular attention to the branch x > 1. First define: * The hyperbolic angle in standard position is the angle at (0, 0) between the ray to (1, 1) and the ray to \\\\textstyle(x, \\\\frac 1 x), where x > 1. * The magnitude of this angle is the area of the corresponding hyperbolic sector, which turns out to be \\\\operatorname{ln}x. Note that, because of the role played by the natural logarithm: * Unlike the circular angle, the hyperbolic angle is unbounded (because \\\\operatorname{ln}x is unbounded); this is related to the fact that the harmonic series is unbounded. * The formula for the magnitude of the angle suggests that, for 0 < x < 1, the hyperbolic angle should be negative. This reflects the fact that, as defined, the angle is directed. Finally, extend the definition of hyperbolic angle to that subtended by any interval on the hyperbola. Suppose a, b, c, d are positive real numbers such that ab = cd = 1 and c > a > 1, so that (a, b) and (c, d) are points on the hyperbola xy=1 and determine an interval on it. Then the squeeze mapping \\\\textstyle f:(x, y)\\\\to(bx, ay) maps the angle \\\\angle\\\\\\\\!\\\\left ((a, b), (0,0), (c, d)\\\\right) to the standard position angle \\\\angle\\\\\\\\!\\\\left ((1, 1), (0,0), (bc, ad)\\\\right). By the result of Gregoire de Saint-Vincent, the hyperbolic sectors determined by these angles have the same area, which is taken to be the magnitude of the angle. This magnitude is \\\\operatorname{ln}{(bc)}=\\\\operatorname{ln}(c/a) =\\\\operatorname{ln}c-\\\\operatorname{ln}a. Comparison with circular angle The unit hyperbola has a sector with an area half of the hyperbolic angle Circular vs. hyperbolic angle A unit circle x^2 + y^2 = 1 has a circular sector with an area half of the circular angle in radians. Analogously, a unit hyperbola x^2 - y^2 = 1 has a hyperbolic sector with an area half of the hyperbolic angle. There is also a projective resolution between circular and hyperbolic cases: both curves are conic sections, and hence are treated as projective ranges in projective geometry. Given an origin point on one of these ranges, other points correspond to angles. The idea of addition of angles, basic to science, corresponds to addition of points on one of these ranges as follows: Circular angles can be characterised geometrically by the property that if two chords P0P1 and P0P2 subtend angles L1 and L2 at the centre of a circle, their sum is the angle subtended by a chord PQ, where PQ is required to be parallel to P1P2. The same construction can also be applied to the hyperbola. If P0 is taken to be the point , P1 the point , and P2 the point , then the parallel condition requires that Q be the point . It thus makes sense to define the hyperbolic angle from P0 to an arbitrary point on the curve as a logarithmic function of the point's value of x.Bj√∏rn Felsager, Through the Looking Glass ‚Äì A glimpse of Euclid's twin geometry, the Minkowski geometry , ICME-10 Copenhagen 2004; p.14. See also example sheets exploring Minkowskian parallels of some standard Euclidean resultsViktor Prasolov and Yuri Solovyev (1997) Elliptic Functions and Elliptic Integrals, page 1, Translations of Mathematical Monographs volume 170, American Mathematical Society Whereas in Euclidean geometry moving steadily in an orthogonal direction to a ray from the origin traces out a circle, in a pseudo-Euclidean plane steadily moving orthogonally to a ray from the origin traces out a hyperbola. In Euclidean space, the multiple of a given angle traces equal distances around a circle while it traces exponential distances upon the hyperbolic line.Hyperbolic Geometry pp 5‚Äì6, Fig 15.1 Both circular and hyperbolic angle provide instances of an invariant measure. Arcs with an angular magnitude on a circle generate a measure on certain measurable sets on the circle whose magnitude does not vary as the circle turns or rotates. For the hyperbola the turning is by squeeze mapping, and the hyperbolic angle magnitudes stay the same when the plane is squeezed by a mapping :(x, y) ‚Ü¶ (rx, y / r), with r > 0 . History The quadrature of the hyperbola is the evaluation of the area of a hyperbolic sector. It can be shown to be equal to the corresponding area against an asymptote. The quadrature was first accomplished by Gregoire de Saint-Vincent in 1647 in his momentous Opus geometricum quadrature circuli et sectionum coni. As expressed by a historian, : [He made the] quadrature of a hyperbola to its asymptotes, and showed that as the area increased in arithmetic series the abscissas increased in geometric series.David Eugene Smith (1925) History of Mathematics, pp. 424,5 v. 1 A. A. de Sarasa interpreted the quadrature as a logarithm and thus the geometrically defined natural logarithm (or \\"hyperbolic logarithm\\") is understood as the area under to the right of . As an example of a transcendental function, the logarithm is more familiar than its motivator, the hyperbolic angle. Nevertheless, the hyperbolic angle plays a role when the theorem of Saint-Vincent is advanced with squeeze mapping. Circular trigonometry was extended to the hyperbola by Augustus De Morgan in his textbook Trigonometry and Double Algebra.Augustus De Morgan (1849) Trigonometry and Double Algebra, Chapter VI: \\"On the connection of common and hyperbolic trigonometry\\" In 1878 W.K. Clifford used the hyperbolic angle to parametrize a unit hyperbola, describing it as \\"quasi-harmonic motion\\". In 1894 Alexander Macfarlane circulated his essay \\"The Imaginary of Algebra\\", which used hyperbolic angles to generate hyperbolic versors, in his book Papers on Space Analysis.Alexander Macfarlane(1894) Papers on Space Analysis, B. Westerman, New York The following year Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society published Mellen W. Haskell's outline of the hyperbolic functions.Mellen W. Haskell (1895) On the introduction of the notion of hyperbolic functions Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 1(6):155‚Äì9 When Ludwik Silberstein penned his popular 1914 textbook on the new theory of relativity, he used the rapidity concept based on hyperbolic angle a, where , the ratio of velocity v to the speed of light. He wrote: :It seems worth mentioning that to unit rapidity corresponds a huge velocity, amounting to 3/4 of the velocity of light; more accurately we have for . :[...] the rapidity , [...] consequently will represent the velocity .76 c which is a little above the velocity of light in water. Silberstein also uses Lobachevsky's concept of angle of parallelism Œ†(a) to obtain .Ludwik Silberstein (1914) Theory of Relativity, Cambridge University Press, pp. 180‚Äì1 Imaginary circular angle The hyperbolic angle is often presented as if it were an imaginary number. Thus, if x is a real number and , then : \\\\cos(i x) = \\\\cosh(x) \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad \\\\sin(i x) = i \\\\sinh(x) so that the hyperbolic functions cosh and sinh can be presented through the circular functions. But these identities do not arise from a circle or rotation, rather they can be understood in terms of infinite series. In particular, the one expressing the exponential function ( e^x = \\\\cosh x + \\\\sinh x\\\\\\\\! ) consists of even and odd terms, the former comprise the cosh function (\\\\textstyle\\\\cosh x = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{x^{2n}}{(2n)!}), the latter the sinh function (\\\\textstyle\\\\sinh x = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!}). The infinite series for cosine is derived from cosh by turning it into an alternating series, and the series for sine comes from making sinh into an alternating series. The above identities use the number i to remove the alternating factor (‚àí1)n from terms of the series to restore the full halves of the exponential series. Nevertheless, in the theory of holomorphic functions, the hyperbolic sine and cosine functions are incorporated into the complex sine and cosine functions.

Her 1946 debut novel The Street became the first novel by an African-American woman to sell more than a million copies.\\"Ann Petry\\", AALBC.com.McKay, p. 127. In 2019, the Library of America published a volume of her work containing The Street as well as her 1953 masterpiece, The Narrows and a few shorter pieces of nonfiction. Early life Ann, born Anna Houston Lane, was born in Old Saybrook, Connecticut. She was the youngest of three daughters to Peter Clark Lane and Bertha James Lane. Her parents belonged to the black minority, numbering 15 inhabitants of the small town.Cott, Nancy F., and Kathryn Allamong Jacob, \\"New Cache of Letters Illuminates Life of African American Novelist Ann Petry\\", Schlesinger Newsletter, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, Harvard University. Her father was a pharmacist and her mother was a shop owner, chiropodist, and hairdresser. Ann was also the niece of Anna Louise James. With Ann and her sister were raised \\"in the classic New England tradition: a study in efficiency, thrift, and utility (‚Ä¶) They were filled with ambitions that they might not have entertained had they lived in a city along with thousands of poor blacks stuck in demeaning jobs.\\"Holladay, p. 7. The family had none of the trappings of the middle class until Petry was well into adulthood. Before her mother became a businesswoman, she worked in a factory, and her sisters worked as maids. The Lane girls were raised sheltered from most of the disadvantages other black people in the United States had to experience due to the color of their skin; however there were a number of incidents of racial discrimination. As Petry wrote in \\"My Most Humiliating Jim Crow Experience\\", published in Negro Digest in 1946, there was an incident where a racist decided that they did not want her on a beach. Her father wrote a letter to The Crisis in 1920 or 1921 complaining about a teacher who refused to teach his daughters and his niece.Petry, Elisabeth, At Home Inside, p. 27. Another teacher humiliated her by making her read the part of Jupiter, the illiterate ex-slave in the Edgar Allan Poe short story \\"The Gold-Bug\\". Petry had a strong family foundation with well-traveled uncles, who had many stories to tell her when coming home; her father, who overcame racial obstacles, opened a pharmacy in the small town; and her mother and aunts set a strong example: Petry, interviewed by The Washington Post' in 1992, says about her tough female family members that \\"it never occurred to them that there were things they couldn‚Äôt do because they were women.\\"Holladay, p. 5. Career Petry's desire to become a professional writer was raised first in high school when her English teacher read her essay to the class and commented on it with the words: \\"I honestly believe that you could be a writer if you wanted to.\\"Holladay, p. 6. The decision to become a pharmacist was her family's. After graduating in 1929 from Old Saybrook High School,\\"Ann Lane Petry\\", Black History Now, July 7, 2014. she went to college and graduated with a Ph.G. degree from the University of Connecticut College of Pharmacy in New Haven in 1931 and worked in the family business for several years, while also writing short stories. On February 22, 1938, she married George D. Petry of New Iberia, Louisiana, and moved to New York. She worked as a journalist writing articles for newspapers including The Amsterdam News (between 1938 and 1941) and The People's Voice (1941‚Äì44),\\"Ann Petry\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. and published short stories in The Crisis, where her first story appeared in 1943, Phylon, and other outlets.\\"Petry, Ann (1908-1997)\\", Ann Petry Collection, Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center. Between 1944 and 1946 she studied creative writing at Columbia University. She also worked at an after-school program at P.S. 10 in Harlem. It was during this period that she experienced and understood what the majority of the black population of the United States had to go through in their everyday life. Traversing the Harlem streets, living for the first time among large numbers of poor black people, seeing neglected children up close‚ÄîPetry's early years in New York inevitably made impressions on her and led her to put her experiences to paper. Her daughter Liz explained to The Washington Post' that \\"her way of dealing with the problem was to write this book [The Street], which maybe was something that people who had grown up in Harlem couldn‚Äôt do.\\". Petry's first and most popular novel, The Street, was published in 1946 and won the Houghton Mifflin Literary Fellowship with book sales exceeding one million copies. She was featured in a brief All-American News film segment covering her winning the award. Back in Old Saybrook in 1947, Petry worked on Country Place (1947), The Narrows (1953), other stories, and books for children, but they never achieved the same success as her first book. She drew on her personal experiences of the hurricane in Old Saybrook in Country Place. Although the novel is set in the immediate aftermath of World War II, Petry identified the 1938 New England hurricane as the source for the storm that is at the center of her narrative. Petry was a member of the American Negro Theater and appeared in productions including On Striver's Row.Atlas, Nava, \\"Ann Petry\\", Literary Ladies Guide, April 22, 2015. She also lectured at University of California, Berkeley, Miami University and Suffolk University, and was Visiting Professor of English at the University of Hawaii.Busby, Margaret, \\"Ann Petry\\", Daughters of Africa, 1992, p. 229. She died in Old Saybrook at the age of 88 on April 28, 1997. She was outlived by her husband George, who died in 2000, and her only daughter, Liz Petry. In November, 2018, Tayari Jones called for a revival of Petry's acclaim, writing that Petry \\"is the writer we have been waiting for, hers are the stories we need to fully illuminate the questions of our moment, while also offering a page-turning good time.\\" Selected bibliography *\\"Marie of the Cabin Club\\" (short story), Baltimore Afro-American, 1939.

The title is in reference to the narrator's belief that insanity is a sort of \\"flexible bullet\\": it will eventually kill, but how long this process takes, and how much damage the bullet does before the victim finally dies, are impossible to predict. Since the publication of this story, King has occasionally used the term \\"flexible bullet\\" to describe insanity, in reference to this story. Plot summary The main character is Henry, fiction editor for the struggling Logan's magazine. Henry receives an unsolicited short story from up-and-coming novelist Reg Thorpe, and considers the story to be very dark, but also a masterpiece. Through his correspondence with Thorpe, Henry learns of‚Äîand, due to Henry's own alcoholism, eventually begins to believe in‚ÄîThorpe's various paranoid fantasies. Most notably, Henry and Thorpe believe that their typewriters serve as homes for Fornits‚Äîtiny elves who bring creativity and good luck. The story, told from Henry's perspective as he relays it in anecdotal form at a barbecue, concerns Henry's descent into Thorpe's madness. Meanwhile, Henry also struggles to get Thorpe's story published, despite the fact that Logan's is in the process of closing its fiction department. Connections In the television mini-series Nightmares and Dreamscapes, a fornit's symbol can be seen on a letter in the story \\"Battlegrounds\\". Major themes Madness is the chief theme of the novella. The narrator is asked to tell a story about a young author who is driven insane by early acclaim. After naming and debating the merits of Sylvia Plath and other novelists, the narrator reveals to the audience his own personal experiences with insanity. Henry's drinking makes him susceptible to Thorpe's fantasies about Fornits and \\"They,\\"- shadowy antagonists never described in detail persecuting Thorpe and his Fornit. Henry confesses that he experienced a drunken hallucination where he met and communicated with his own Fornit, making Henry an unreliable narrator. The narrator, Henry, is a recovering alcoholic. Much of the novella describes how Reg Thorpe's delusions, although unrelated to alcoholism, mirror and amplify Henry's own irrational and self- destructive conduct. This could be considered a case of folie √† deux. \\"The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet\\" shares a common theme of fear of nuclear power with Stephen King's novel The Tommyknockers. While at a literary party, the protagonist of The Tommyknockers delivers a drunken rant about the dangers of atomic power. This is of course similar to Thorpe and Henry's fears of radium crystals and radiation poisoning. The novella mentions the case of the Radium Girls as an example of society's ignorance of the dangers of nuclear power. As the novella is the story of a story told at a house party, \\"The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet\\" is a frame tale.

Under Canon Law, a college is a collection (Latin collegium) of persons united together for a common object so as to form one body. The Bishop of Rome (the Pope) is the head of the college.  Authority of the college of bishops  In Roman Catholic teaching, the college of bishops is the successor to the college of the apostles.New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Educational 1983 ), vol. 1, p. 989 While the individual members of the college of bishops are each directly responsible for pastoral care and governance in their own particular Church, the college as a whole has full supreme power over the entire Church: The college exercises this supreme and full power in a solemn manner in an ecumenical council, but also through united action even when not gathered together in one place.Code of Canon Law, canon 337 ¬ß1-2 By present-day canon law it is for the Pope to select and promote the ways in which the bishops are to act collegially, such as in an ecumenical council, and it is for him to convoke, preside over (personally or by his delegates), transfer, suspend, or dissolve such a council, and approve its decrees.Code of Canon Law, canons 337 ¬ß3 and 338 The Catholic Church teaches that the college of bishops, gathered in council or represented by the Pope, may teach some revealed truth as requiring to be held absolutely and definitively (infallibly).Alan Richardson, John Bowden (editors), The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology (Presbyterian Publishing 1983 ), p. 344  Enunciation of the teaching by the Second Vatican Council  The Second Vatican Council enunciated the doctrine of the collegiality of bishops as follows:  Unique relationship  The relationship between the college of bishops and the individual bishops and in particular the Bishop of Rome has no secular counterpart, and its practical consequences cannot be deduced from secular models such as the various forms of governance of a state or of a corporation.George Weigel, The Courage to Be Catholic (Basic Books 2004 ), p. 119 The doctrine of the collegiality of the bishops as a body was enunciated by the Second Vatican Council which \\"desired to integrate all the elements which make up the Church, both the mystical and the institutional, the primacy and the episcopate, the people of God and the hierarchy, striking new notes and establishing new balances which would have to be worked out and theologized upon in the lived experience of the Church.\\"Charles M.

It is celebrated on such occasions as a papal coronation, an ex cathedra pronouncement, the canonization of a saint, on Easter or Christmas or other major feast days. Until the 1960s, there were numerous special ceremonials that were particular to the pope. Many have fallen out of use; some were last celebrated by Pope Pius X (reigned 1903-1914) or Pope Paul VI (reigned 1963-1978). Ceremonial in the past A papal Mass celebrated in the early 20th century, before the liturgical reforms of Popes Pius X and Paul VI, took this form: =Assistant ministers= In the papal Mass a cardinal-bishop acted as assistant priest; this honor fell on the most solemn occasions to the Cardinal-bishop of Ostia, the Dean of the College of Cardinals. Cardinal- deacons acted as deacon and assistant deacons. An auditor of the Sacra Rota served as subdeacon. There were also a Greek-Catholic deacon and subdeacon, vested according to the Byzantine Rite. The other offices were filled by the assistants to the pontifical throne, the members of the prelatical colleges, etc. =Vestments= Before the beginning of the ceremony, the pope was vested in the falda (a particular papal vestment which forms a long skirt extending beneath the hem of the alb), amice, alb, cincture, pectoral cross, stole, and a very long cope known as the \\"mantum\\" (or \\"papal mantle\\"). Finally, the papal tiara was placed on his head. =Entrance= The pope's solemn entry into St. Peter's Basilica was accompanied by the Silveri Symphony, a fanfare played on the trumpets of the Noble Guard. The entrance procession was headed by the cardinals, bishops, prelates, and those who composed the pontifical capella, vested according to their rank and in their prescribed order of precedence. A thurifer and seven acolytes accompanied the cross-bearer, and the apostolic subdeacon carried the Gospel Book (a function now reserved to a deacon). At the end of the procession the pope was carried into the basilica on the sedia gestatoria and with the two flabella borne on either side. He was accompanied by an entourage which included the Swiss Guards in their colorful uniforms and members of the Roman nobility in formal court dress. At times, a canopy was carried above his head. Two protonotaries apostolic raised the front of the falda as the pope walked to and from the sedia, and two papal chamberlains carried the train. The dean of the Rota carried the jewelled mitre (the mitra pretiosa), and finally two patriarchs or archbishops carried the book and bugia (hand-candle) respectively.An unfavourable description is given in Robert Willis, The Democracy of God: An American Catholicism (iUniverse, 2006), p. 106. The pope was received at the door by the cardinal-priest and the Canons of St. Peter's. He then knelt briefly, leaning on a faldstool, to adore the Blessed Sacrament. Fittingly, this often took place at the St. Gregory's Altar in St. Peter's. He then went to the small throne for the chanting of Terce, during which he received the obedience of the cardinals, bishops, and abbots. While the psalms of Terce were being chanted, he read the prayers of preparation for Mass, during which his buskins and papal slippers were put on. He then sang the prayer of Terce. After Terce, his outer vestments were removed, leaving only the falda, amice, alb, and cincture. The pope washed his hands, and put on the following vestments (in order), assisted by the deacon: *sub-cinctorium *pectoral cross *fanon (lower & upper piece) ‚Äî a two piece vestment worn only by the pope during Solemn High Mass, with the two pieces connected only by a central buttonhole. It resembled a shoulder cape with alternating stripes of silver and gold. *stole *tunicle *dalmatic *episcopal gloves *chasuble *fanon (upper piece only) ‚Äî The upper piece was pulled out from under the other vestments, and was worn over the chasuble and under the pallium. The lower piece remained under the other vestments. *pallium *mitre *episcopal ring (He did not use the crosier or the bugia at this point.) He then gave the kiss of peace to the last three of the cardinal- priests. =The Mass= Elevation during the papal form of solemn pontifical high Mass celebrated by Pope John XXIII in St. Peter's Basilica in the early 1960s. Note the mitre and the papal tiaras placed on the high altar. The Greek clergy are standing - as is customary - while the others kneel. The Mass proceeded according to the order of a solemn pontifical high Mass with the following differences: At the Confiteor, the cardinal bishop stood to the right of the pope, the cardinal deacon to the left, with the other ministers behind. The pope then put on the maniple. The Pope wore a special maniple intertwined with red and gold threads, symbolizing the unity of the Eastern and Western rites of the Catholic Church. After the first censing, the cardinal deacons kissed the pope on cheek and breast, and the Pontiff retired to the throne before the Chair of Saint Peter in the apse. The senior deacon, who wore a mitre, sat on a faldstool before the altar and facing the throne; the apostolic subdeacon, together with the Greek ministers, sat on the steps of the altar; while the assistant bishop and the two assistant deacons remained near the throne. The Epistle was sung first in Latin by the apostolic subdeacon and then in Greek by the Byzantine Rite subdeacon, following the ritual of the Greek Church. After the Epistle, the two subdeacons went together and kissed the feet of the pope. Likewise the Gospel was chanted first in Latin by the cardinal-deacon and then in Greek by the Eastern Rite deacon. The Latin Gospel was accompanied by seven candles, the Greek Gospel by two. After the Gospel both Gospel books were brought to the pope, who kissed both of them. While elevating the Host and the chalice the pope turned in a half circle towards the Epistle and Gospel sides, respectively, as the \\"Silveri Symphony\\" was played on the trumpets of the Noble Guard (an honorary unit which was abolished in 1970). Eight prelates held torches for the elevation, but no sanctus bell was used at any time in a papal Mass. It was customary for some of the bread and wine used at the Mass to be consumed, as a precaution against poison or invalid matter, by the sacristan and the cup- bearer in the presence of the pope, first at the offertory and again before the Pater noster in a short ceremony called the praegustatio. =Communion= After giving the kiss of peace to the assistant priest and assistant deacons, the Pope went to the throne, and there received Communion, standing. The master of ceremonies placed a twelve-rayed asterisk on the paten, to cover the Host. The cardinal deacon elevated the paten to the height of his forehead so that it was seen by the people and the pope. He then placed the paten in the hands of the subdeacon, which had been covered with a richly embroidered veil known as the linteum pectorale, so that the subdeacon could bring it to the pope at the throne. The deacon then elevated the chalice in the same manner as the paten, the master of ceremonies covered the chalice with an embroidered pall, and the deacon carried it to the throne. The pope consumed the smaller portion of the Host, and communicated from the chalice through a thin golden tube called the fistula. He then divided the remainder of the Host, gave communion to the deacon and subdeacon; the deacon stood to receive communion and the subdeacon knelt. They then kissed the pope's ring, and he gave them the kiss of peace. Only these three individuals received communion. =Postcommunion= After communion, the pope received the wine of the purification from another chalice and purified his fingers in a little cup. The deacon and subdeacon returned to the altar and partook of the chalice through the fistula, the subdeacon consumed the particle of the Host in the chalice, and both the deacon and the subdeacon consumed the wine and the water used in the purification of the chalice. The pope then returned to the altar to finish the Mass. After the blessing, the assistant priest of the Mass published a plenary indulgence for all those in attendance. At the end of the \\"Last Gospel\\" (usually ), the pope went to the sedia gestatoria, put on the tiara, and returned in procession as he had entered, with the same escorts. Modern day Modern papal Mass in S√£o Paulo, Brazil The full ceremonial detailed above has not been used since early in the pontificate of Pope Paul VI, who abolished many of the offices of the papal court previously required for the celebration of the papal Mass. Soon after his coronation, Paul VI ceased using the papal tiara. He discontinued the use of many traditional features of papal dress, including the papal slippers and pontifical gloves. However, he did carry a distinctive form of papal ferula, silver in colour, which Pope John Paul II also used. Pope Benedict XVI carried a golden ferula with a central image of the Lamb of God and without a figure of Christ crucified. On certain occasions, Pope John Paul II and Benedict XVI wore the fanon while celebrating Mass. The custom of having the Gospel chanted in Greek by a Greek Catholic deacon on certain occasions is practiced on occasion, most notably during canonisations. Latin is used for most papal Masses in Rome, but the local vernacular has been used with increasing frequency in recent decades, especially when the pope is abroad. However, in the last years of his pontificate Pope Benedict XVI always used Latin for the Eucharistic Prayer when celebrating Mass abroad. Under Pope Francis several Papal Masses in Saint Peter's Square have used the Italian language. On Palm Sunday 2014, Latin was only used for the readings and some of the responses, while the next year's Palm Sunday service was for the first time said entirely in Italian. In the earlier papal Mass, only the pope, the deacon, and the subdeacon received Holy Communion. In modern papal Masses many receive, some from the pope himself. It has become common for the pope to celebrate Mass in stadiums or sports arenas abroad, so as to accommodate a larger number of pilgrims. It is also current practice to celebrate some Masses in Saint Peter's Square. However, much more often, papal Masses in Vatican City take place inside Saint Peter's Basilica. These Masses, with participants from many lands, point to the universality of the Roman Catholic faith. The intentions of the Universal Prayer are spoken in a variety of vernacular languages, while the invocation sung in Latin. The Midnight Mass at Christmas normally takes place inside Saint Peter's Basilica and is telecast worldwide. After the end of the Second Vatican Council, several of the particular ceremonies and vestments used in papal Masses were gradually discontinued. Pope Benedict XVI revived some of these traditions. One example was the playing of the Papal Anthem on brass instruments from the loggia of the interior of Saint Peter's Basilica to announce the arrival of the Pope, followed by the chanting of \\"Tu Es Petrus\\" by the Sistine Chapel Choir when appropriate.

The first and eponymous website was created by a husband-and-wife team in the classic back- bedroom Internet start-up; it was the first online social network to achieve prominence in Britain, and it weathered the dotcom bust. Each site worked on the principle of user-generated content through which registered users were able to post information about themselves which could be searched by other users. A double-blind email system allowed contact between users. Formerly, the site cost ¬£7.50 per year to use but it was later free of charge.

He was a Canadian Senator from October 4, 2001 until January 24, 2020, and was the leader of the Senate Liberal Caucus from June 15, 2016, to November 14, 2019. He became the interim leader of the Progressive Senate Group on November 14, 2019, and served for slightly less than one month in the role. On the eve of his pending retirement from the Senate, Day tweeted his farewell remarks. He mentioned that it was an honour to serve his fellow New Brunswickers and all Canadians. Furthermore, he also gave a farewell speech. He retired from the Senate on January 24, 2020, upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75. Education and early career Day studied at College Militaire Royal Saint- Jean in 1963. He graduated from the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario in 1968 with a Bachelor of Engineering degree. He served in the Royal Canadian Air Force from 1963 to 1968 and held the rank of Lieutenant-colonel. He is an honorary member of the Royal Military College of Canada, and served on its Board of Governors from 2004 to 2007. Day subsequently earned a Bachelor of Law degree from Queen's University and a Masters of Law from Osgoode Hall Law School. Over the course of his legal career, Day has been recognized as a specialist in intellectual property matters by the Law Society of Upper Canada, and is a fellow of the Intellectual Property Institute of Canada. Day entered politics in 1978, when a by-election was held in his native New Brunswick. Day returned from his practice of law in Ottawa, Ontario, to contest the by-election as a candidate of the Liberal Party of Canada, but was defeated in what had long been a Progressive Conservative stronghold. He faced the same electorate three times in two years due to the rapid succession of general elections that came in May 1979 and February 1980. In 1982, he ran for the leadership of the New Brunswick Liberal Party, but was narrowly defeated on the final ballot by Doug Young. The leadership race was very divisive, and the Liberals went down to their worst defeat in recent history in the 1982 provincial election. Day, who sought election to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in a Saint John riding, was defeated in his fifth contest in five years. Day's wife, Georgie Day, was elected to the legislature, on her first attempt in electoral politics, in 1991, and was re-elected in 1995. While in the legislature, she served in the cabinets of premiers Frank McKenna, Ray Frenette, and Camille Th√©riault. Senate Day was appointed to the Senate of Canada from New Brunswick in 2001. He has been active on issues of Veterans Affairs Canada and media concentration. He is scheduled to retire as a Senator on January 24, 2020 upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75. On January 29, 2014, Liberal Party leader Justin Trudeau announced all Liberal Senators, including Day, were removed from the Liberal caucus, and would continue sitting as Independents. According to Senate Opposition leader James Cowan, the Senators will still refer to themselves as Liberals even if they are no longer members of the parliamentary Liberal caucus. Day was elected leader of the Senate Liberal Caucus on June 15, 2016.http://www.lop.parl.gc.ca/ParlInfo/Files/Parliamentarian.aspx?Item=2314cdba-8980-4d80-8be1-c66766a15b36&Language;=E&Section;=FederalExperience With the Senate Liberal Caucus facing losing official parliamentary caucus status in 2020 with a third of its caucus facing mandatory retirements on their turning age 75, Day announced that the Senate Liberal Caucus had been dissolved and a new Progressive Senate Group formed in its wake, with the entire membership joining the new group, including Day, who was announced as the interim leader of the new group. With Day's mandatory retirement in January 2020, on December 12, 2019, Nova Scotia senator Jane Cordy tweeted that her colleagues in the Progressive Senate Group had selected her as the new leader, ostensibly effective that same date. Additionally, she subsequently announced later that day Senator Terry Mercer would be moving into the whip/caucus chair role, that Senator would be become the new deputy leader, and that the interim monikers were being removed at the same time.

Members must be at least 14 years old, or 13 years old and have completed eighth grade, through age 21. The purpose of Venturing is to provide positive experiences to help youth mature and to prepare them to become responsible adults. History The Venturing program has a long history within the BSA. The program got its start in the 1930s as the \\"Senior Scout\\" Division for boys 15 and older. The Senior Scout programs included the Sea Scouts, Air Scouts, Explorer Scouts, Rover Scouts, and a few others. Explorer Scouts focused on advanced camping and worked on advancement leading to the Ranger Award. Sea Scouts and Air Scouts were nautical and aviation- focused programs, respectively. In 1949 the Senior Scout Division became the Explorer Division. Sea Scouts became Sea Explorers, Air Scouts became Air Explorers, and Explorer Scouts simply Explorers. The Explorer program became less of an advanced outdoor program and more a broader program for young men, with the minimum age lowered to 14 years old. Explorers got a new advancement program leading to the Silver Award. Explorer advancement was dropped in 1959. The Air Explorer program was eliminated in 1964 and the Sea Explorer program had changes made. The program was further changed to be more appealing to older youth, with career exploration becoming a bigger part of the program. The BSA allowed young women ages 14‚Äì20 to join special-interest Explorer posts beginning in 1969. Many posts became co-ed. The focus on career exploration was increased and, as the years progressed, Exploring focused more on career exploration posts, though outdoor and sports-oriented Posts continued to thrive. Posts that primarily consisted of seminars at high school with guest speakers were designated as Career Awareness Explorer posts in the early 1980s. This was the fastest growing segment of Exploring and the BSA during the 1980s. These posts were realigned into the new Learning for Life subsidiary in 1991, and the posts were then designated as High School Career Awareness groups and the youth were no longer considered to be Explorers. The Exploring program was reorganized and split into two program categories in 1998. All the career-oriented posts were moved to Learning for Life under the name Exploring, while the rest (including outdoor-oriented posts) became the new Venturing program. Sea Exploring was renamed Sea Scouting and placed under the Venturing program. In February 2016, Sea Scouting became a separate program division. Venturers wearing informal uniforms Organization The Venturing crew is sponsored by a community organization such as a business, service organization, school, labor group, or church. The chartered organization is responsible for selecting leadership, providing a meeting place, and promoting a good program. The chartered organization representative is the liaison between the crew, the chartered organization, and the BSA. The crew may elect to be all-male, all-female, or co-ed. The crew committee is a group of adults, led by the crew committee chair, who guide the crew program and activities and manage record keeping, finance, leadership recruitment, and registration. The crew must have at least five adults registered with the crew to become a legitimate crew. The crew is led by youths who are elected to the positions of president, one or more vice-presidents, secretary, treasurer, quartermaster, guide, and historian. Other positions in the Venturing crew may exist, such as activity chair. The adult adviser and associate advisers provide guidance while allowing the youth to lead the crew. =Venturing Officers' Association= At the Council, Area, Regional, and National level, Venturing is led by youth organized into Venturing Officers' Associations. The National VOA, previously known as the National Venturing Cabinet, are the youth leaders of the Venturing program. These youth are the National Venturing President, the National Venturing Vice President, and the four regional Venturing presidents.  National Venturing President  Tyler Grey was selected by a 11-member panel of youth from around the country on March 12, 2020. He is the 2020-21 National Venturing President. Grey has been active in Scouting since 2007, beginning when he joined Pack 911 of Western Los Angeles County Council in Northridge, CA. He fell in love with the Scouting program, and the unique challenges and opportunities that it offered him, and continued on into Troop 10 and Crew 1956. Grey is an Eagle Scout, and has previously served as the 2019-2020 Western Region Venturing President. Grey has received the Venturing Leadership Awards at all levels of the organization (Council, Area, Region, and National). He is a Vigil Honor member of Malibu Lodge, as well as a Silver Shark Award recipient, Founder's Award recipient, and was named a James E. West fellow by his lodge. Grey has served on staff for numerous council, area, regional, and national Venturing trainings and events. Notable projects include work redeveloping the Western Region Venturing Officers' Orientation, establishing task forces for communication and program, and serving as the Western Region basecamp lead at VenturingFest 2018 at the Summit Bechtel Reserve. Grey attends the University of California, pursuing a degree in applied mathematics. This term, he hopes to work with the four regions to increase transparency and visibility of the National VOA, rebuild Region Venturing Officers' Orientation standards, and provide Venturers across the nation with opportunities to give feedback directly to the National VOA and National Venturing Committee. Tyler looks forward to building on past successes in communication, expanding the access that Venturers have to share their experiences and insight with their local VOAs. Tyler Grey will lead the National VOA for the 2020-2021 term, alongside Samantha Troiano, the 2020-2021 National Venturing Vice President. Region Venturing Officers' Associations The Venturing program, like the Boy Scouts of America, is split into four regions: Northeast, Southern, Central, and Western. The Region Venturing Officers' Associations are led by youth Region Venturing Presidents and Vice Presidents of Administration, Program, and Communication. For the 2020-2021 term, the 4 Region Venturing Presidents are Ian Arnold (NER), Amy Hermann (SR), Andrew Steckner (CR), and Juliana Murillo (WR). Uniform 100px \\"The recommended uniform [for Venturers] is the spruce green Venturing shirt with green epaulette tabs and gray backpacking style shorts or gray casual pants. However, the uniform, if any, is the choice of the crew.\\" Some sources also indicate that while the uniform is their choice, Venturing youth should \\"(b)e aware that the BSA tan shirt is not to be used by Venturers.\\" Official Venturing uniform pieces available from the National Supply Division include a spruce green button-up shirt or blouse with a pointed collar, two front button-flap pockets, shoulder epaulets with shoulder loops, short sleeves, and a US flag attached to the right shoulder and a Venturing - BSA strip above the right pocket. The other components are charcoal gray trousers or shorts, gray socks and a gray web belt with brass buckle (currently being phased out in favor of a newer black webbed belt and \\"rolled claw\\" black metal buckle similar to the forest green belt introduced in 2008 for the Centennial Scouting Uniform). The gray cap and the gray brimmed hat with Venturing logo are also available for use by Venturing crews. Venturers who wear the official Venturing shirt or blouse should wear the proper insignia as outlined in the Insignia Guide. Either the official Venturing emblem or an approved crew specialty patch may be worn on the right sleeve. Green shoulder loops identify Venturers at the crew level. Adults or youth with a district or council position wear silver loops while those with area, regional or national positions wear gold loops. The shirttail is tucked in. Recognition =Youth recognition= A new series of awards were introduced on June 1, 2014. The Venturing Award is a joining award, requiring Personal Safety Awareness training and an induction ceremony. * The Discovery Award requires participating in adventures, CPR and first aid training, completing the Leadership Skills for Crews course, the Goal-Setting and Time Management training courses and the Crew Officers Orientation, setting and achieving a personal goal, participating in service activities and completing an Advisor conference and a crew board of review. * The Pathfinder Award requires participating and leading adventures, Project Management training, giving leadership to advanced adventures, serving as a leader in the crew or serving on staff for leadership training, setting and achieving personal goals, leading a crew project, participating in service activities and completing an Advisor conference and a crew board of review. * The Summit Award requires participating and leading adventures, completing Mentoring training, mentoring an activity, serving as a leader in the crew or serving on staff for leadership training or leading Introduction to Leadership Skills for Crews, completing a personal reflection, creating a personal code of conduct, leading an ethical controversy and conflict resolution scenario, planning and conducting a service project and completing an Advisor conference and a crew board of review. Venturers may also earn expert awards: the Ranger Award for outdoors, the TRUST Award for religious and community life, and the Quest Award for sports. Venturing youth are eligible for the Venturing Leadership Award. There are four levels of these awards: council (for those at the crew, district, and/or council levels), area (for those at the area level), region (for those at the region level) and National. A limited number of these awards are presented on an annual basis to those involved in Venturing who have made exceptional contributions to Venturing at their particular level and who exemplify the Venturing Code. There are other awards, such as the Venturing Shooting Sports Outstanding Achievement Award and the Venturing World Conservation Award. Venturers may also earn other awards common to the Scouting program such as the William T. Hornaday Awards. Venturers may also be recognized for their \\"excellent achievements and service to their community, state and nation\\" with the Young American Award. Members under the age of 18 may also earn the Star, Life, and Eagle Scout ranks from the Scouts BSA program if they have earned at least First Class rank in a troop. =Adult leader recognition= Venturing adult leaders who complete training, tenure, and performance requirements are recognized by a system of awards. The Venturing Leader's Training Award is available to any leader, while the Venturing Advisor's Key and Venturing Advisor Award of Merit are only available to the Advisor. =Service recognition= The Venturing Leadership Award was briefly unavailable to adults from 2012 - 2015. It is again a recognition for Venturers and advisors who exemplify living by the values of the Scout Oath and Law in service to other people and to the movement. The Venturing Bronze awards for Arts and Hobbies, Outdoor, Sea Scouts, Sports and Religious Life were introduced with the new Venturing program in 1998 along with the Gold Award and the Silver Award. They were discontinued on December 31, 2014. =Girl Scouts (GSUSA)= Girl Scouts who have earned the Gold Award may wear the award on the Venturing uniform. Program and activities Generally, each crew will select a specialty that determines the program and activities. An outdoor focused crew will do a lot of camping, while a religious life crew will probably be involved in church activities and community service projects. Crews are encouraged to have an annual Super Activity, which is typically a week-long event, usually during the summer. Crews within a district, council or area may jointly perform activities that promote advancement through fun and competition. The Venturing Safe Rides program provides a free and confidential safe ride home to any young adult who is not in a condition to drive safely, or who wants to avoid being a passenger in such a situation. Training New leaders are encouraged to attend training for their position. This training provides the essential information they need to provide a safe and high-quality program. =Youth training= Youth training in Venturing consists of a Crew Officer Briefing conducted by the Crew Advisor. The first step of leadership training in Venturing is the Introduction to Leadership Skills for Crews (ILSC) program, which replaced Venturing Leadership Skills course. This course is designed to teach crew leaders about their new roles and how to perform them. It is intended to help Venturers in leadership positions understand their responsibilities and to equip them with organizational and leadership skills. This program is the first course in the series of leadership training offered to Venturers. When youth leaders complete this program they are eligible to attend the National Youth Leadership Training in their local council and the National Advanced Youth Leadership Experience at Philmont or the Summit Bechtel Reserve. ILSC is also required for Kodiak. Kodiak is a week-long or two weekend-long, outdoor trek-based training course where Venturers are given five leadership commissions. This program is conducted by the local Boy Scout council. The final step of youth leadership training in Venturing is Kodiak X. Kodiak X adds two more commissions to those youth learned in Kodiak and allows the youth to put their skills to the test through different challenges. Kodiak is required for this course. Kodiak X is a one weekend-long course and must be conducted at a Council level. =Adult training= Venturing Fast Start is the introduction for adult leaders new to the Venturing program. Fast Start is self paced and provided as a video or online. BSA Youth Protection Training is required for all adult leaders and participants. Re-certification is required every two years. Basic Leader Training consists of This is Scouting and Venturing Leader Specific Training. This is Scouting is a common core program for all adult leaders in the BSA. Venturing Leader Specific Training gives the Advisor or Associate Advisor the needed knowledge and skills. Once Basic Leader Training is completed the leader is awarded a Trained emblem for uniform wear. Powder Horn is designed to introduce Venturing and Boy Scout leaders to the activities and resources needed to operate an outdoor and high- adventure program and is based on the Venturing Ranger program. Supplemental training modules are designed to provide orientation beyond Basic Leader Training. These training sessions are often provided at the Roundtable (a monthly meeting of leaders), at University of Scouting programs offered by the local council and at National Scouting Conferences held at Philmont Scout Ranch, and the Florida National High Adventure Sea Base. Wood Badge is the advanced training program for leadership skills for all adults in all BSA programs. Wood Badge consists of six days of training, usually presented as two three-day weekends, and an application phase lasting no more than 18 months. When training is complete leaders are recognized with the Wood Badge beads, neckerchief, and woggle.

For a fixed positive real number , the mapping :(x, y) \\\\mapsto (ax, y/a) is the squeeze mapping with parameter . Since :\\\\\\\\{ (u,v) \\\\, : \\\\, u v = \\\\mathrm{constant}\\\\\\\\} is a hyperbola, if and , then and the points of the image of the squeeze mapping are on the same hyperbola as is. For this reason it is natural to think of the squeeze mapping as a hyperbolic rotation, as did √âmile Borel in 1914,√âmile Borel (1914) Introduction Geometrique √† quelques Th√©ories Physiques, page 29, Gauthier- Villars, link from Cornell University Historical Math Monographs by analogy with circular rotations, which preserve circles. Logarithm and hyperbolic angle The squeeze mapping sets the stage for development of the concept of logarithms. The problem of finding the area bounded by a hyperbola (such as is one of quadrature. The solution, found by Gr√©goire de Saint-Vincent and Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa in 1647, required the natural logarithm function, a new concept. Some insight into logarithms comes through hyperbolic sectors that are permuted by squeeze mappings while preserving their area. The area of a hyperbolic sector is taken as a measure of a hyperbolic angle associated with the sector. The hyperbolic angle concept is quite independent of the ordinary circular angle, but shares a property of invariance with it: whereas circular angle is invariant under rotation, hyperbolic angle is invariant under squeeze mapping. Both circular and hyperbolic angle generate invariant measures but with respect to different transformation groups. The hyperbolic functions, which take hyperbolic angle as argument, perform the role that circular functions play with the circular angle argument.Mellen W. Haskell (1895) On the introduction of the notion of hyperbolic functions Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 1(6):155‚Äì9,particularly equation 12, page 159 Group theory :A squeeze mapping moves one purple hyperbolic sector to another with the same area. It also squeezes blue and green rectangles. If and are positive real numbers, the composition of their squeeze mappings is the squeeze mapping of their product. Therefore, the collection of squeeze mappings forms a one-parameter group isomorphic to the multiplicative group of positive real numbers. An additive view of this group arises from consideration of hyperbolic sectors and their hyperbolic angles. From the point of view of the classical groups, the group of squeeze mappings is , the identity component of the indefinite orthogonal group of 2 √ó 2 real matrices preserving the quadratic form . This is equivalent to preserving the form via the change of basis :x=u+v,\\\\quad y=u-v\\\\,, and corresponds geometrically to preserving hyperbolae. The perspective of the group of squeeze mappings as hyperbolic rotation is analogous to interpreting the group (the connected component of the definite orthogonal group) preserving quadratic form as being circular rotations. Note that the \\"\\" notation corresponds to the fact that the reflections :u \\\\mapsto -u,\\\\quad v \\\\mapsto -v are not allowed, though they preserve the form (in terms of and these are and ; the additional \\"\\" in the hyperbolic case (as compared with the circular case) is necessary to specify the identity component because the group has connected components, while the group has components: has components, while only has 1. The fact that the squeeze transforms preserve area and orientation corresponds to the inclusion of subgroups - in this case ‚Äì of the subgroup of hyperbolic rotations in the special linear group of transforms preserving area and orientation (a volume form). In the language of M√∂bius transformations, the squeeze transformations are the hyperbolic elements in the classification of elements. Applications In studying linear algebra there are the purely abstract applications such as illustration of the singular-value decomposition or in the important role of the squeeze mapping in the structure of 2 √ó 2 real matrices. Here some of the usual applications are summarized with historic references. =Relativistic spacetime= Spacetime geometry is conventionally developed as follows: Select (0,0) for a \\"here and now\\" in a spacetime. Light radiant left and right through this central event tracks two lines in the spacetime, lines that can be used to give coordinates to events away from (0,0). Trajectories of lesser velocity track closer to the original timeline (0,t). Any such velocity can be viewed as a zero velocity under a squeeze mapping called a Lorentz boost. This insight follows from a study of split-complex number multiplications and the diagonal basis which corresponds to the pair of light lines. Formally, a squeeze preserves the hyperbolic metric expressed in the form xy; in a different coordinate system. This application in the theory of relativity was noted in 1912 by Wilson and Lewis,Edwin Bidwell Wilson & Gilbert N. Lewis (1912) \\"The space-time manifold of relativity. The non-Euclidean geometry of mechanics and electromagnetics\\", Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences 48:387-507, footnote p. 401 by Werner Greub,W. H. Greub (1967) Linear Algebra, Springer-Verlag. See pages 272 to 274 and by Louis Kauffman.Louis Kauffman (1985) \\"Transformations in Special Relativity\\", International Journal of Theoretical Physics 24:223-36 Furthermore, the squeeze mapping form of Lorentz transformations was used by Gustav Herglotz (1909/10) while discussing Born rigidity, and was popularized by Wolfgang Rindler in his textbook on relativity, who used it in his demonstration of their characteristic property.Wolfgang Rindler, Essential Relativity, equation 29.5 on page 45 of the 1969 edition, or equation 2.17 on page 37 of the 1977 edition, or equation 2.16 on page 52 of the 2001 edition The term squeeze transformation was used in this context in an article connecting the Lorentz group with Jones calculus in optics.Daesoo Han, Young Suh Kim & Marilyn E. Noz (1997) \\"Jones-matrix formalism as a representation of the Lorentz group\\", Journal of the Optical Society of America A14(9):2290‚Äì8 =Corner flow= In fluid dynamics one of the fundamental motions of an incompressible flow involves bifurcation of a flow running up against an immovable wall. Representing the wall by the axis y = 0 and taking the parameter r = exp(t) where t is time, then the squeeze mapping with parameter r applied to an initial fluid state produces a flow with bifurcation left and right of the axis x = 0. The same model gives fluid convergence when time is run backward. Indeed, the area of any hyperbolic sector is invariant under squeezing. For another approach to a flow with hyperbolic streamlines, see . In 1989 OttinoJ. M. Ottino (1989) The Kinematics of Mixing: stretching, chaos, transport, page 29, Cambridge University Press described the \\"linear isochoric two-dimensional flow\\" as :v_1 = G x_2 \\\\quad v_2 = K G x_1 where K lies in the interval [‚àí1, 1]. The streamlines follow the curves :x_2^2 - K x_1^2 = \\\\mathrm{constant} so negative K corresponds to an ellipse and positive K to a hyperbola, with the rectangular case of the squeeze mapping corresponding to K = 1. Stocker and HosoiRoman Stocker & A.E. Hosoi (2004) \\"Corner flow in free liquid films\\", Journal of Engineering Mathematics 50:267-88 described their approach to corner flow as follows: :we suggest an alternative formulation to account for the corner-like geometry, based on the use of hyperbolic coordinates, which allows substantial analytical progress towards determination of the flow in a Plateau border and attached liquid threads. We consider a region of flow forming an angle of œÄ/2 and delimited on the left and bottom by symmetry planes. Stocker and Hosoi then recall Moffatt'sH.K. Moffatt (1964) \\"Viscous and resistive eddies near a sharp corner\\", Journal of Fluid Mechanics 18:1-18 consideration of \\"flow in a corner between rigid boundaries, induced by an arbitrary disturbance at a large distance.\\" According to Stocker and Hosoi, :For a free fluid in a square corner, Moffatt's (antisymmetric) stream function ... [indicates] that hyperbolic coordinates are indeed the natural choice to describe these flows. =Bridge to transcendentals= The area- preserving property of squeeze mapping has an application in setting the foundation of the transcendental functions natural logarithm and its inverse the exponential function: Definition: Sector(a,b) is the hyperbolic sector obtained with central rays to (a, 1/a) and (b, 1/b). Lemma: If bc = ad, then there is a squeeze mapping that moves the sector(a,b) to sector(c,d). Proof: Take parameter r = c/a so that (u,v) = (rx, y/r) takes (a, 1/a) to (c, 1/c) and (b, 1/b) to (d, 1/d). Theorem (Gregoire de Saint-Vincent 1647) If bc = ad, then the quadrature of the hyperbola xy = 1 against the asymptote has equal areas between a and b compared to between c and d. Proof: An argument adding and subtracting triangles of area ¬Ω, one triangle being {(0,0), (0,1), (1,1)}, shows the hyperbolic sector area is equal to the area along the asymptote. The theorem then follows from the lemma. Theorem (Alphonse Antonio de Sarasa 1649) As area measured against the asymptote increases in arithmetic progression, the projections upon the asymptote increase in geometric sequence. Thus the areas form logarithms of the asymptote index. For instance, for a standard position angle which runs from (1, 1) to (x, 1/x), one may ask \\"When is the hyperbolic angle equal to one?\\" The answer is the transcendental number x = e. A squeeze with r = e moves the unit angle to one between (e, 1/e) and (ee, 1/ee) which subtends a sector also of area one. The geometric progression : e, e2, e3, ..., en, ... corresponds to the asymptotic index achieved with each sum of areas : 1,2,3, ..., n,... which is a proto-typical arithmetic progression A + nd where A = 0 and d = 1 . =Lie transform= Following Pierre Ossian Bonnet's (1867) investigations on surfaces of constant curvatures, Sophus Lie (1879) found a way to derive new pseudospherical surfaces from a known one. Such surfaces satisfy the Sine-Gordon equation: :\\\\frac{d^{2}\\\\Theta}{ds\\\\ d\\\\sigma}=K\\\\sin\\\\Theta where (s,\\\\sigma) are asymptotic coordinates of two principal tangent curves and \\\\Theta their respective angle. Lie showed that if \\\\Theta=f(s,\\\\sigma) is a solution to the Sine-Gordon equation, then the following squeeze mapping (now known as Lie transform) indicates other solutions of that equation: Reprinted in Lie's collected papers, Vol. 3, pp. 392‚Äì393. :\\\\Theta=f\\\\left(ms,\\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{m}\\\\right) Lie (1883) noticed its relation to two other transformations of pseudospherical surfaces:. Reprinted in Lie's collected papers, Vol. 3, pp. 556‚Äì560. The B√§cklund transform (introduced by Albert Victor B√§cklund in 1883) can be seen as the combination of a Lie transform with a Bianchi transform (introduced by Luigi Bianchi in 1879.) Such transformations of pseudospherical surfaces were discussed in detail in the lectures on differential geometry by Gaston Darboux (1894), Luigi Bianchi (1894), or Luther Pfahler Eisenhart (1909). It is known that the Lie transforms (or squeeze mappings) correspond to Lorentz boosts in terms of light-cone coordinates, as pointed out by Terng and Uhlenbeck (2000): :Sophus Lie observed that the SGE [Sinus-Gordon equation] is invariant under Lorentz transformations. In asymptotic coordinates, which correspond to light cone coordinates, a Lorentz transformation is (x,t)\\\\mapsto\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\lambda}x,\\\\lambda t\\\\right). This can be represented as follows: :\\\\begin{matrix}-c^{2}t^{2}+x^{2}=-c^{2}t^{\\\\prime2}+x^{\\\\prime2} \\\\hline \\\\begin{align}ct' & =ct\\\\gamma-x\\\\beta\\\\gamma & & =ct\\\\cosh\\\\eta-x\\\\sinh\\\\eta x' & =-ct\\\\beta\\\\gamma+x\\\\gamma & & =-ct\\\\sinh\\\\eta+x\\\\cosh\\\\eta \\\\end{align}  \\\\hline u=ct+x,\\\\ v=ct-x,\\\\ k=\\\\sqrt{\\\\tfrac{1+\\\\beta}{1-\\\\beta}}=e^{\\\\eta} u'=\\\\frac{u}{k},\\\\ v'=kv \\\\hline u'v'=uv \\\\end{matrix} where k corresponds to the Doppler factor in Bondi k-calculus, Œ∑ is the rapidity.

The original bridge, which operated from 1901 to 2015, was replaced by the current bridge (also called the City Island Causeway), which opened in 2017. A temporary bridge was used for the demolition and construction period between the original and new bridges. Old bridge Since the American Revolutionary War, there have been plans to link City Island with the mainland via means of a bridge. Before the original bridge named \\"City Island Bridge\\" was opened, there was another, unnamed bridge connecting City Island with the rest of the Bronx. The opening date of this first bridge is unclear; some sources attest that it opened in 1873, while one letter states that it opened in 1857‚Äîa disputed date since the letter's writer may have been referring to a past date.Roe, Zachariah, 1894. Letter in the archives of the City Island Historical Society, concerning the construction of the first bridge from the Bronx to City Island. Dated August 8, 1894. This first bridge, which was definitely under planning in the 1860s, was listed in an 1872 map. It was a tolled drawbridge that was built partly out of wood from the USS North Carolina. This bridge was located north of the 1899 bridge and connected to City Island at Bridge Street. When the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation took over Pelham Bay Park in 1888, it claimed responsibility for maintenance over the western end of the bridge, which was located in the park. The second City Island Bridge, which was actually the first with that particular name, began construction in 1898 and was completed in 1901. The $200,000 bridge was of stone and steel construction, and spanned . It consisted of five fixed spans and a central swing section. As originally built, the bridge's City Island end connected to City Island Avenue rather than at Bridge Street, and was located partially on landfill. The bridge was the sole entry and exit for vehicles on City Island. As such, it served both as a landmark and a gateway to City Island. The swing section was deactivated and turned into a fixed span in 1963. In 1978‚Äì1979, a proposed renovation would have detonated explosives on the corroding piers, but the plan was altered so that the piers would get heavy refurbishment instead. By 2002, the bridge was in bad shape, and city leaders held a meeting about the deteriorating bridge, showing images of corrosion on the supports, although the corrosion had since been fixed by that time. The bridge, which had been inspected in July 1999, had been deemed capable of carrying up to . The city leaders listed four options for the bridge's future: one entailed renovating the existing span, while the other three were for new spans. The new span proposals included a conventional causeway-style bridge with four piers; an arch bridge with large foundations on either side of the water; and a cable- stayed bridge with a tower either high. Replacement Sidewalk view of the now demolished 1901 bridge with \\"Welcome to City Island\\" sign To replace the deteriorating bridge, the city originally intended to build a cable-stayed bridge, with a high tower, wide at the top, with a base of . Vertical clearance above high water would be . The new bridge would be located in the same footprint as the existing bridge, although it would be wider to accommodate three standard-width traffic lanes, a bicycle lane and a pedestrian walkway. The original schedule was for the project to begin in 2007 with completion in 2010. The project was then postponed until June 2012.New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT)(2011). \\"2010 Bridges and Tunnels Annual Condition Report.\\" Accessed January 30, 2012.NYCDOT (2004). \\"2003 Bridges and Tunnels Annual Condition Report.\\" p. 36. Accessed September 11, 2009. Due to the project postponement, during 2010 repairs were made to the existing bridge deck, piers, and west abutment. Due to a lack of funding the project was delayed once more until the city announced it would accept bids in late 2012, with Tutor Perini selected as general contractor in February 2013. In 2005 the estimated cost of the project was $50 million.H. Perahia, L. King, K. Batra, S. Jarosz (2005). \\"City Island Cable-Stayed Bridge in New York City.\\" Presented at the 3rd New York City Bridge Conference, New York, September 12‚Äì13, 2005. In 2009 the estimate increased to $120 million due to redesigns and the addition of related projects. The final bid came in at $102.7 million. Some residents, however, opposed the design of the cable- stayed bridge and felt that its tower would be out of character with the low- rise homes on City Island. Opponents of the bridge design filed a lawsuit against the city on November 6, 2013. A Bronx Supreme Court judge granted a temporary injunction on that date. In December 2013 the court lifted the injunction, but ruled that the city must conduct public hearings. The city's prior consultations with the island community, which began during the early design stages, had been informal. The court's ruling requires the city to follow its Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, which includes local Community Board hearings. On May 5, 2014, the original bridge plans were scrapped, and the de Blasio administration chose to go with a slightly cheaper and much shorter causeway-style bridge. The bridge, which was later approved, would be completed by 2017. A temporary steel bridge was erected in 2015, but a partial collapse in September delayed the opening of the temporary bridge. On December 16, 2015, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) conducted a road test on the temporary steel bridge by running heavy equipment including fire trucks over the bridge. The NYCDOT conducted the tests to ease residents' concerns about the integrity of the temporary structure. Two days later on December 18, the original bridge was closed, and traffic was routed to the temporary bridge. Shortly after that, the city began demolishing the original bridge, with the new bridge being constructed on the same site as the 1901 bridge. The new bridge opened on October 29, 2017.

History Voigtl√§nder was founded in Vienna, Archduchy of Austria, in 1756, by . Voigtl√§nder produced mathematical instruments, precision mechanical products, optical instruments, including optical measuring instruments and opera glasses, and is the oldest name in cameras. =Early beginnings= Johann Christoph Voigtl√§nder (November 19, 1732 in Leipzig ‚Äì June 27, 1797 in Vienna), the son of a carpenter, came to Prague in 1755, and to Vienna in the same year, and worked from 1757 to 1762 in the workshop of Meinicke, who produced mathematical instruments. Through Johann Voigtl√§nder's skilful achievements, the Minister of State of the Habsburg Monarchy‚ÄîPrince Wenzel von Kaunitz, drew attention to Voigtl√§nder and Empress Maria Theresa of Austria granted Voigtl√§nder in 1763 a so-called trade \\"Protection Decree\\" (German Schutzdekret/Schutzdecret): \\"on the making of mathematical instruments and on an unspecified number of workers\\", upon which Voigtl√§nder founded his own workshop and whereby he could sell his products relatively unrivalled. In 1767, Voigtl√§nder invented two important tools: a linear device for natural and tapered gauges, and a circular device for elevation, astrolabe, and cartography etc., including, a screw cutting machine, a metal lathe and finishing rollers for sheep wool and silk factories. The production program was supplemented by compasses, tweezers, levelling devices, dioptres and other fine mechanical products. In recognition of his achievements and dexterity, Voigtl√§nder received in 1797 a so-called \\"national commercial license with all advantages and privileges\\" (German Landesfabriksbefugnis); this license awarded Voigtl√§nder under certain circumstances the prestige to display the imperial eagle of the Habsburg monarchy, but above all the right to establish branch sales offices in all major cities of the empire. In the same year, Voigtl√§nder died, and his successful family business was continued by his widow, their three sons and one daughter.

The Voigtl√§nder objectives were revolutionary because they were the first mathematically calculated precision objectives in the history of photography, developed by the German-Hungarian mathematics professor Josef Maximilian Petzval, with technical advice provided by Peter Voigtl√§nder. Voigtl√§nder went on to produce the first Petzval portrait photographic lens (the fastest lens at that time: f/3.6) in 1840, and the world's first all- metal daguerreotype camera (Ganzmetallkamera) in 1840, also bringing out photographic plate cameras shortly afterwards.

In 1845, Peter Voigtl√§nder married the daughter of a respected Braunschweig lawyer, whom he met on one of his photographic sales journeys in Braunschweig. Voigtl√§nder had previously set up a branch sales office in Braunschweig, Duchy of Brunswick, at that time the central hub in the German rail network. Compared to Vienna, Braunschweig offered a location advantage regarding the distribution of Voigtl√§nder objectives and daguerreotype camera products due to the greater proximity to the German overseas ports. During the rising social and political tensions in the Austrian Empire leading to the Revolutions of 1848, Peter Voigtl√§nder had joined the political cause of the Democrats and also became adjutant to the commander of the Vienna national civil guard‚ÄîGeneral . As the revolutions escalated during the Vienna Uprising of October 1848, the counter-revolution had strengthened with full force, and General Messenhauser of the revolting national civil guard, like many others‚Äîwere executed. Voigtl√§nder at that time had in perception of the power relations withdrawn from the Vienna national civil guard and with his family took refuge in a suburb of Vienna. On the wishes of Peter Voigtl√§nder's wife and when the March revolutions of 1848 hindered the further development of the young photographic company, the family promptly re-located from Vienna to his wife's hometown Braunschweig, where from 1849 Voigtl√§nder established a subsidiary production site, granted on a provisional \\"Concession for the pursuit of a trade\\", issued by the city directorate with a term of five years. In September 1852, Peter Voigtl√§nder was successfully awarded a so-called \\"land-cooperative\\" (German Markgenossenschaft) and issued the desired unrestricted \\"Concession for the pursuit of a trade\\" in the city Braunschweig. In 1864, Peter Voigtl√§nder was honoured by Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria with the Knight's Cross of the Order of Franz Joseph; becoming known as Peter Wilhelm Friedrich Ritter von Voigtl√§nder. On the death of Voigtl√§nder's Vienna works manager, the Vienna business was closed in 1868. Voigtl√§nder Braunschweig changed status to a public Aktiengesellschaft (Voigtl√§nder & Sohn AG) in 1898. In 1923 a majority of the shares (99.7%) were acquired by Schering AG's photo division and large- scale production then took place in 1925. Over the next three decades, Voigtl√§nder became a technology leader and the first manufacturer to introduce several new kinds of product that later became commonplace. These include the first zoom lens for 35mm still photography (36‚Äì82/2.8 Zoomar) in 1959 and the first 35mm compact camera with built-in electronic flash (Vitrona) in 1965. Schering sold its share of the company to the Carl Zeiss Foundation in 1956, and Zeiss-Ikon and Voigtl√§nder-Vertriebsgesellschaft integrated in 1965. Due to falling sales, on 4 August 1971 Zeiss-Ikon/Voigtl√§nder- Vertriebsgesellschaft ended producing cameras and closed the Voigtl√§nder factory, which employed at the time 2,037 persons. Subsequently, the company moved to the collective enterprise Optische Werke Voigtl√§nder (Optical Works Voigtl√§nder), in which Carl Zeiss AG, the state of Lower Saxony and the Braunschweig camera manufacturer Rollei each participated to one-third; Later Rollei took over all the shares. On the collapse of Rollei in 1982, Plusfoto took over the name, selling it in 1997 to Ringfoto. =Contemporary times= Since 1999, Voigtl√§nder-branded products have been manufactured and marketed by the Japanese optics and camera company Cosina, under license from Ringfoto GmbH & Co.

It was later collected in Bradbury's short story collections R is for Rocket and The Golden Apples of the Sun. It deals with a rocket expedition sent to a planet to see whether or not its natural resources can be harvested for the human race. They discover a paradise which seems to provide for them whatever they desire even as they think of it. They ultimately decide to leave the planet and report that it is hostile and of no benefit to humans. Adaptations A teleplay of this story was written by Bradbury for possible use on the television program The Twilight Zone, but Rod Serling and the producers of the show deemed it too expensive to film. This led to the end of Ray Bradbury's brief association with the show, which resulted in just one of his stories (\\"I Sing the Body Electric\\") being used. It was later produced as a radio episode of the series Bradbury 13 (June 18, 1984) and the television program Ray Bradbury Theater (November 30, 1990). A Soviet animated adaptation of the story (in Russian:–ó–¥–µ—Å—å –º–æ–≥—É—Ç –≤–æ–¥–∏—Ç—å—Å—è —Ç–∏–≥—Ä—ã, Zdes mogut voditsya tigry, ru)https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2384180 was produced in 1989, with the plot change that one of the men wishes to harvest the resources and leave, to the point where he sets an anti-matter bomb to blow the planet up. The planet promptly has him killed, whilst the captain takes the bomb on board their spaceship and takes off, although not until after one of the men sneaks off to live on the planet. The navigator tells the captain of this, saying it is not too late to turn back and get him, but the captain reveals the bomb, stating that it is too late, and to plot a course as far away as possible. The story ends with the planet giving the remaining astronaut a new pet dog, as well as the promise of a female companion. The movie was directed by Vladimir Samsonov (ru). Similar stories in popular culture In the original Star Trek episode \\"Shore Leave\\", a crew finds a planet where any of their desires once thought are acted out in real life. This is due to an alien life-form's superior technology, as the planet is actually an alien amusement park. The crew eventually comes to relax on the planet before continuing on their journey. This episode aired in 1966, fifteen years after Ray Bradbury's story was first published.

Revell is a manufacturer of plastic scale models. The original American Revell merged with Monogram. In 2007, American Revell was purchased by Hobbico while the European Revell Germany separated from the American company in 2006 until Hobbico purchased it as well ‚Äì bringing the two back together again under the same company umbrella. In 2017, Quantum Capital Partners took over operations of Revell after Hobbico declared bankruptcy. Early history Lewis H. Glaser, a California entrepreneur, founded a plastics molding firm called Precision Specialties in Hollywood during 1943. The company made a variety of products contracted for different companies, the first reportedly being a small washing machine (Gosson 2015, p. 65; Maui Historical Web site; Pentago 2010) One of the first toy-related products were HO scale (1:87) train sets, including locomotives, and a variety of cars along with buildings. The building line was extensive, including a farm group, a suburban passenger station, and a variety of utility structures. Many of these originals were reproduced later in other scales. The toy line was marketed later under the brand name Revell. Reportedly, the name Revell came from the French word reveille meaning \\"new beginning\\" (Miller n.d.). The Revell logo at the time was the early relative of today's design. =Gowland and Highway Pioneers= About 1950, Revell reproduced Maxwell and Ford Model T assembled toys originally designed by the Gowland Brothers in England, a company producing toys since 1932 (Gowland & Gowland 2007). According to noted collector Cecil Gibson (Gibson 1971, p. 12), these did not sell so well in England, but Revell had much better luck with the series in the U.S. The Revell box said, \\"By John Gowland‚Äîcreator of Champ and Chu Chu\\" (Funding Universe Web page). The 1911 Maxwell and 1910 Model T were about 1:16 scale and called \\"Action Pull Toys\\", which consisted of a wound thin metal cord with a plastic handle. The cord was attached through the front of the car to the rear axle. The car's body was hinged, so when the plastic handle was pulled, the car bounced on the floor ‚Äì with the driver bobbing up and down. The box advertised that these were \\"Made in Hollywood\\" and were called Revell \\"Play Planned\\" toys. These were scaled down from the original Gowland Bros. plastic vehicles. Different sets in the series came in similar boxes with varied colors. Other boxes were orange, yellow and blue. A couple of years later, these toys were scaled down and modeled as 3/8\\" to a foot scale (four to five inches) and called \\"Highway Pioneers Quick Construction\\" kits‚Äîmost without the rather cartoonish figures and without the mechanical 'action' (Gowland & Gowland 2007). These new 1:32 toys met with great success and sold much better than the larger Maxwell, even though it was made famous by Jack Benny's radio show, circa 1953. The original larger cars were discontinued and Revell focused on the newer kits, with the Gowland hot air balloon logo still shown on the green, yellow, orange or blue boxes (Funding Universe Web page). Box information shows models were offered in at least four series, not including the Maxwell and four other Highway Pioneers released in UK (from the Hudson Miniature molds). Series one consisted of a 1900 Packard, 1903 Ford Model A, 1910 Ford Model T roadster, 1909 Stanley Steamer, and a 1903 Cadillac. Series two was 1914 Stutz Bearcat, 1915 Ford Model T Sedan, 1908 Buick Rumble, 1910 Studebaker, and a 1910 Cadillac ( later the Olds delivery was substituted). Series three was the 1904 Oldsmobile (later the 1910 Cadillac was substituted), 1904 Rambler, 1907 Sears, 1910 Pierce Arrow, and a 1911 Rolls Royce (Gowland & Gowland 2007). Series Four included a 1915 Fiat, 1907 Renault, an MGTD, Jaguar 120 and 4,1 L Ferrari. Revell also offered gift sets of the five car series, and a \\"Collector's Kit\\" set with ten individually wrapped kits of the Highway Pioneer models in one box. Models in the \\"Highway Pioneers\\" series were commonly retooled and later offered by a number of other companies including Premier, Lincoln International, J & L Randall Ltd (\\"Merit\\" brand), Lodela (licensed in Mexico) Crush, and Minicraft. Eventually the original Highway Pioneers tools were acquired by British model train manufacturer Dapol Ltd. The models are currently out of production and reportedly the tooling is located in Wales, headquarters of Dapol, along with redundant tools from Airfix, Kitmaster and Tri-ang Model Land. Some of these copies and knock-offs appeared very early and at the same time Revell was making them. F Revell acquire five non-Gowland designs, like the 1911 Maxwell offered by Hudson Miniatures of Scranton, Pennsylvania, appeared in 1952 under the \\"Lil' Old Timers\\" name. The Hudson Miniatures kits usually were manufactured with a small brochure giving historical facts on each vehicle. One preserved example sold around 1953 in Strouss-Hirshbergs for 69 cents; the box advertised the model as a \\"Quickie-Kit\\". Revell, GB added these to the Highway Pioneer offerings in similar packaging to other US offering at that time. These five were later marketed by Heller as Cadet series and eventually were adapted with new tires in Germany. Ultimately two of the five and Gowland Rolls Royce were marketed by SMER. =Other 1950s offerings= A Revell built model of the SMS Dresden from 1907. In 1953, a replica of the battleship USS Missouri' was produced by Revell, its first casting beyond the British Gowland models. Reportedly, their models of U.S. Navy warships were so accurate, that in 1960 it was discovered that the Kremlin had purchased a significant number of different models to help fill in blank spots in their intelligence regarding the design of American warships. Several jet and propeller aeroplane models followed along with ships (classic and contemporary), jet engines, and in the late 1950s, rockets and spacecraft (Bussie 2007). This included models of Redstone and other military test missiles and Vanguard, Jupiter and Atlas rockets. Other issues, like the Helios \\"Nuclear\\"-powered ship, \\"Moon Ship\\", a \\"Passenger Rocket\\", a \\"Space Taxi\\", and a not-so-incredible \\"Space Shuttle\\" were kits more in the science-fiction realm. One site describes the one-time 1959 issue of an envisioned space station as the \\"Holy Grail\\" of Revell kits (Old Model, 2005‚Äì2014). Infantry figures and various dioramas, especially for railroad setups, were also produced. A 1:72 scale Revell Heinkel He 111. In the later 1950s, Revell began making more automotive-related models. Beside jet engines, car engine models like the Chrysler Slant-Six were produced. Car models tended toward a more global selection than AMT or MPC or other American plastic model makers, with many European brands produced, including many British makes. One interesting offering came about with a collaboration with AMT making the 1955 and 1956 promotional Buick. The models were atypical for the time in that there was full chassis detail, and bodies were cast in several pieces. Revell made these specifically ready-built for showroom display (Doty 2011, p. 87). Another interesting kit offering related to pop culture, was the 1956 Lincoln Futura concept car ‚Äì a vehicle that, with out- of-this-world bubble windows, would eventually become George Barris's Batmobile (Jefferis 2010). The Kustom 1960s Starting in the late 1950s, model kits began to veer away strongly from stock presentations and focus on customizing, hot rodding, and racing. The 1960s solidified this direction with almost infinite variations in how a kit could be built. This trend showed both the extensive new marketing reach of the hobby as well as the pervasive individuality portrayed in American car customizing (DeWitt 2002). A built Cadillac low-rider. Model companies hired big name customizers to create new and striking designs. Just as AMT had hired George Barris and Darryl Starbird, Revell hired Ed \\"Big Daddy\\" Roth about 1962 as their new stylist (Funding Universe Web page). Hawk Models would use Bill Campbell's \\"'Weird-Ohs\\" like \\"Davey\\" the wild motor-bike rider and \\"Digger\\" the dragster, and later, Monogram would hire designer Tom Daniel. At this time, Roth created the bubble-glassed \\"Beatnik Bandit\\" (later made even more famous when produced by Hot Wheels), the double engined \\"Mysterion\\", the asymmetrical \\"Orbitron\\", the \\"Outlaw\\" (a highly styled T bucket), and the \\"Road Agent\\". Apart from wheeled wonders, arguably his most famous creation was the \\"Rat Fink\\", an anti-Mickey Mouse figure (Ed Roth Cars 2008‚Äì2011). Roth's Web site reports that in 1963 Revell paid Roth 1 cent for every one of his model kits sold, totaling $32,000 (Biography 2008‚Äì2011). In the early-to-mid-1960s, slot car racing became a fad, and like many other companies, Revell attempted to enter the fray by using its plastic model car bodies with mechanicals underneath‚Äîfit for the track. In 1965 Revell acquired International Raceways, planning high grade race tracks that could fill whole rooms (See photos in Siposs 1965, p. 16). Soon thereafter, the company opened a \\"Revell Raceway\\" commercial slot car racing facility at 6840 La Tijera Boulevard, Los Angeles, California, actively demonstrating six track configurations that commercial slot car racing businesses could order for fabrication by Revell, with prices ranging from $2,500 to $8,000USD. \\"One of the largest commercial model car raceways in the United States, being approximately 17,000 square feet, it features all the plush appointments and six tracks, the largest being 220 running feet with banked turns up to 60 degrees.\\" (Braverman and Meumann 1966). It may have been too much too late: The competition was too keen and the slot car hobby was already starting to wane in influence (Funding Universe Web page). Slot car kings like Chicago's Strombecker would eventually be purchased by Tootsietoy and end up making simple plastic cars and other toys. By 1967, Revell's experiment in the hobby had racked up a nearly half-million dollar loss (Funding Universe Web page). =Money troubles and Monogram merger= About 1980, as the modeling hobby was weakening in America and sales of plastic kits plummeted, Revell was purchased by French toy company, Generale du Jouet (also known as CEJI), which hoped to take advantage of Revell's European division and presence. Still, Generale du Jouet was having financial troubles of its own, and by 1983 Revell was again spun off (Funding Universe Web page). White- Fruehauf Mobilgas Tanker. Original molds issued in the late 1950s, reissued in 1995. In 1986, after declining profitability in a new era of video games and cable television, Revell was purchased by Odyssey Partners of New York and folded into Monogram Models of Morton Grove, Illinois (which Odyssey had purchased earlier that year). Its plant in Venice was closed and all its usable assets were transferred to Monogram's Number 2 plant in Des Plaines, Illinois. The new company then moved to Northbrook, Illinois. Due to the worldwide name recognition, Revell has become the primary brand name used on many of its kit lines, and after years of seeing both names on the logo, the Monogram name is now again portrayed separately. The company was then headquartered in Elk Grove Village, Illinois, United States. Its major American competitors in the plastic model kit market include AMT-Ertl, Lindberg, and Testors. Revell in Germany In 1956, the German subsidiary, Revell Plastics GmbH, was founded in B√ºnde, West Germany. During the 1970s, this company started developing and manufacturing its own lines of model kits independently and outside the direct control of Revell, USA. These models were imported into the United States, and some of the newer kits earned a reputation for high quality. However, the \\"German\\" kits are now produced only in Eastern Europe or China under the German Revell label. Once known as Revell AG (private stock company), the German company has now changed to the legal form of GmbH & Co. KG (Inc./ public stock company). Revell Germany became independent after its formal separation from Revell-Monogram LLC in September 2006, but was purchased by Hobbico early in 2012, bringing both Revells back into the same company once again. While separate, the German products continued to be advertised on the American company web site, and its logo was almost identical to that of Revell in the United States. When it comes to total revenue, the German company ranked somewhat above the former American parent company. Revell Europe Mercedes-Benz Unimog. Besides an array of airplane and military kits, Revell Germany has also made a variety of 1:24 and 1:18 scale accurately rendered pre-assembled die-cast model cars. These were first produced in the late 1980s and were typical Porsche, Ferrari, BMW and Mercedes-Benz offerings with some Corvettes and a 1965 Mustang (Johnson 1998, p. 200). Starting around 2000, the company simplified its diecast line calling it simply, \\"Revell Metal\\", as opposed to plastic seen in the kits. These later models have mostly been earlier German vehicles, with a focus on micro-cars. Examples are the Lloyd Alexander, Messerschmitt Kabinroller KR 200, BMW Isetta, and a very authentic looking DKW Junior. Some models, like the Goggomobil T250 and the BMW Isetta came in a couple of trim versions. The Goggomobil appeared in a closed roof, austerely basic model as well as an open \\"cloth\\" roofed fancy decor version with whitewall tyres and chrome grille, which was probably not the popular model with less affluent German consumers of the real car just following World War II. The Isetta is appealing in miniature with opening front access door and 'tilt-away' steering wheel. The model also features a removable side panel next to the location of the tiny engine. The BMW was available in several colors ‚Äì with and without rear luggage rack and also in a special yellow 'Bundespost' (German Mail) version. Revell Europe 1:18 scale metal Fiat 500 and Fiat 600 Rally. Some of the larger vehicles featured have been the mid-1950s Mercedes-Benz 180 \\"ponton\\" sedan and a variety of European Fords, mainly from the 1960s. The postwar decade cars' interiors are consistently authentically decorated in period grey and white colours typical of the austerity of the times. A couple of more modern diecast models have been a VW Scirocco, BMW 850i coupe and an Acura NSX. Generally, German Revell diecast models all have opening doors, hoods and trunks. Revell Germany also incorporated former Matchbox models from the UK. In 1977, they also acquired all the Axis Powers model tooling of the former Frog (Tri-ang / Air Lines) brand, as its new Soviet owners (NOVO) did not want anything resembling \\"fascist\\" symbols. Recent history In 1994, Revell-Monogram was purchased by Hallmark Cards as part of its Binney and Smith division (the owners of famous Crayola crayons; see Shope 1994). This relationship lasted for thirteen years. On May 2, 2007, Hobbico, Inc. announced it had acquired American Revell-Monogram, LLC, corporate owner of the Revell name (Dodson 2007). The Revell name now stands alone in the company logo, without the Monogram name also present, though Monogram still exists as an important line of models in the Revell stable. Hobbico also acquired Revell of Germany in 2012, reuniting the two brands under one banner, but often models sold in the U.S. show Revell Germany as the parent with Hobbico nowhere labeled. On January 10, 2018, Hobbico, Inc. (Zigterman 2018) filed for bankruptcy protection. On April 13, 2018, Revell USA temporarily ceased operations while they reorganized. On April 17, 2018, it was announced that international investment group Quantum Capital Partners (QCP) would be taking over operations of Revell (Dunkel 2018). Currently, Revell USA operates out of Illinois and is regularly releasing new products.

Banks keep reserves at Federal Reserve Banks to meet their reserve requirements and to clear financial transactions. Transactions in the federal funds market enable depository institutions with reserve balances in excess of reserve requirements to lend reserves to institutions with reserve deficiencies. These loans are usually made for one day only, that is, \\"overnight\\". The interest rate at which these deals are done is called the federal funds rate. Federal funds are not collateralized; like eurodollars, they are an unsecured interbank loan.Discount Window vs. Fed Funds Federal funds transactions by regulated financial institutions neither increase nor decrease total reserves in the banking system as a whole. Instead, they redistribute reserves. Before 2008, this meant that otherwise idle funds could yield a return. (Since 2008, the Fed has paid interest on bank reserves,http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/20081006a.htm interest on reserves including excess reserves.) Banks may borrow these funds in order to meet the reserves required to back their deposits. Federal funds are definitive money, meaning that they are available for immediate spending, while checks and many other forms of money must be cleared by banks and typically take several days before becoming available for spending. Participants in the federal funds market include commercial banks, savings and loan associations, government-sponsored enterprises, branches of foreign banks in the United States, federal agencies, and securities firms. Many relatively small institutions that accumulate reserves in excess of their requirements lend reserves overnight to money center and large regional banks, as well as to foreign banks operating in the United States. Federal agencies also lend idle funds in the federal funds market. The Fed, which is the central bank of the United States, conducts monetary policy primarily by targeting a certain value for the federal funds rate. If the Fed wishes to move to, for example, a more expansionary monetary policy, it conducts open market operations, which includes primarily bank reserves; since this puts more liquidity into the banking system, it pushes down the federal funds rate.

He represented Maryland in the Continental Congress in 1782 and 1783. Hemsley's entire life was closely connected with his family's plantation, Clover Fields Farm, in Queen Anne's County on Maryland's Eastern Shore. The family had been established there and in Talbot County for several generations. His career of public service was similar to that of many prominent planters. He was a county official in both counties at various times, and served as a Colonel in the militia of Queen Anne's County during the Revolutionary War. Hemsley was first elected to the Maryland state senate in November 1779. He would serve in that body until 1781. Then in 1782‚Äì1783 he served in the Continental Congress in New York. He was again elected to the state senate in 1784, but declined that election. He would serve again from 1786 to 1789. Although re-elected again in 1790, he did not serve. He was a member of the Maryland Convention that ratified the United States Constitution on April 28, 1788. His later years were spent running the family plantation. He died there on June 5, 1812 and was buried in the family's cemetery on the farm, near Queenstown, Maryland. His son, William Hemsley, Jr., also served in the state senate in 1799‚Äì1800.

Bumper (SS-333) was launched 6 August 1944 by Electric Boat Co., Groton, Conn.; sponsored by Mrs. Margaret Williams (n√©e Smith), wife of the prospective commanding officer; and commissioned 9 December 1944, Commander J. W. Williams, Jr., in command. Between 22 April and 15 August 1945 Bumper completed two war patrols in the Java and South China Seas and the Gulf of Siam. During this time she sank a 1189-ton tanker, destroyed another small tanker at anchor, and sank four miscellaneous small craft by gunfire. Bumper arrived at Fremantle, Australia, from her last war patrol 15 August 1945. On 31 August 1945 she departed Fremantle for Subic Bay, Philippine Islands where she arrived 9 September. She served as a unit of Submarines, Philippine Sea Frontier, until February 1946 when she returned to California for repairs. Repairs completed, she reported for duty with Submarine Squadron 5 at Pearl Harbor and operated in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands until December. On 16 December 1946 she departed Pearl Harbor to conduct a simulated war patrol. She called at Truk, Caroline Islands; Subic Bay, Philippine Islands; Yokosuka, Japan; and Midway. She also spent six weeks with Northern Training Group, Western Pacific, at Tsingtao, China, and in the Yellow Sea. She returned to Pearl Harbor 29 March 1947. Early in January 1948 Bumper proceeded to California and underwent yard overhaul until 1 June 1948. She arrived back at Pearl Harbor 12 June and shortly thereafter commenced her second simulated war patrol in the Western Pacific, returning to Pearl Harbor 29 September 1949.  TCG √áanakkale (S 333)  Bumper operated out of Pearl Harbor until 7 February 1950 when she returned to the United States. She transited the Panama Canal 22 February 1950 and operated along the eastern seaboard until 16 September 1950 when she was decommissioned. She was transferred to Turkey 16 November 1950 and recommissioned as TCG √áanakkale (S 333). She served in the Turkish Navy until she was decommissioned 11 August 1976.  Honors and awards  Bumper received one battle star for her World War II service.

Under normal circumstances, accidentally consuming too much water is exceptionally rare. Nearly all deaths related to water intoxication in normal individuals have resulted either from water-drinking contests, in which individuals attempt to consume large amounts of water, or from long bouts of exercise during which excessive amounts of fluid were consumed. In addition, water cure, a method of torture in which the victim is forced to consume excessive amounts of water, can cause water intoxication. Water, just like any other substance, can be considered a poison when over-consumed in a brief period of time. Water intoxication mostly occurs when water is being consumed in a high quantity without adequate electrolyte intake. Excess of body water may also be a result of a medical condition or improper treatment; see \\"hyponatremia\\" for some examples. Water is considered one of the least toxic chemical compounds, with an LD50 of over 150 ml/kg in rats. ‚Äî see to Section 11: Toxicological Information for the LD50 verification Risk factors =Low body mass (infants)= It can be very easy for children under one year old (especially those under nine months) to absorb too much water. Because of their small body mass, it is easy for them to take in a large amount of water relative to body mass and total body sodium stores. =Endurance sports= Marathon runners are susceptible to water intoxication if they drink too much while running. This is caused when sodium levels drop below 135 mmol/L when athletes consume large amounts of fluid. This has been noted to be the result of the encouragement of excessive fluid replacement by various guidelines. This has largely been identified in marathon runners as a dilutional hyponatremia. A study conducted on runners completing the 2002 Boston Marathon found that thirteen percent finished the race with hyponatremia. The study concluded that the strongest predictor of hyponatremia was weight gain while racing (over-hydration), and hyponatremia was just as likely to occur in runners who chose sports drinks as those who chose water. Medical personnel at marathon events are trained to suspect water intoxication immediately when runners collapse or show signs of confusion. =Overexertion and heat stress= Any activity or situation that promotes heavy sweating can lead to water intoxication when water is consumed to replace lost fluids. Persons working in extreme heat and/or humidity for long periods must take care to drink and eat in ways that help to maintain electrolyte balance. People using drugs such as MDMA (often referred to colloquially as \\"Ecstasy\\") may overexert themselves, perspire heavily, feel increased thirst, and then drink large amounts of water to rehydrate, leading to electrolyte imbalance and water intoxication ‚Äì this is compounded by MDMA use increasing the levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), decreasing the amount of water lost through urination. Even people who are resting quietly in extreme heat or humidity may run the risk of water intoxication if they drink large amounts of water over short periods for rehydration. =Psychiatric conditions= Psychogenic polydipsia is the psychiatric condition in which patients feel compelled to drink large quantities of water, thus putting them at risk of water intoxication. This condition can be especially dangerous if the patient also exhibits other psychiatric indications (as is often the case), as the care-takers might misinterpret the hyponatremic symptoms. =Iatrogenic= When an unconscious person is being fed intravenously (for example, total parenteral nutrition) or via a nasogastric tube, the fluids given must be carefully balanced in composition to match fluids and electrolytes lost. These fluids are typically hypertonic, and so water is often co-administered. If the electrolytes are not monitored (even in an ambulatory patient), either hypernatremia or hyponatremia may result. Some neurological/psychiatric medications (Oxcarbazepine, among others) have been found to cause hyponatremia in some patients. Patients with diabetes insipidus are particularly vulnerable due to rapid fluid processing.What Is Diabetes Insipidus? Pathophysiology At the onset of this condition, fluid outside the cells has an excessively low amount of solutes, such as sodium and other electrolytes, in comparison to fluid inside the cells, causing the fluid to move into the cells to balance its concentration. This causes the cells to swell. In the brain, this swelling increases intracranial pressure (ICP), which leads to the first observable symptoms of water intoxication: headache, personality changes, changes in behavior, confusion, irritability, and drowsiness. These are sometimes followed by difficulty breathing during exertion, muscle weakness & pain, twitching, or cramping, nausea, vomiting, thirst, and a dulled ability to perceive and interpret sensory information. As the condition persists, papillary and vital signs may result including bradycardia and widened pulse pressure. The cells in the brain may swell to the point where blood flow is interrupted resulting in cerebral edema. Swollen brain cells may also apply pressure to the brain stem causing central nervous system dysfunction. Both cerebral edema and interference with the central nervous system are dangerous and could result in seizures, brain damage, coma or death. Prevention Water intoxication can be prevented if a person's intake of water does not grossly exceed their losses. Healthy kidneys are able to excrete approximately 800 millilitres to 1 litre of fluid water (0.84 - 1.04 quarts) per hour. However, stress (from prolonged physical exertion), as well as disease states, can greatly reduce this amount. Treatment Mild intoxication may remain asymptomatic and require only fluid restriction. In more severe cases, treatment consists of: * Diuretics to increase urination, which are most effective for excess blood volume. * Vasopressin receptor antagonists Notable cases * 1991, Andy Warhol: Five years after his death, Warhol's family publicly accused the hospital where he had his gallbladder removed of causing his death by water intoxication administered post- operatively. A claimed autopsy weight of , with his weight being when admitted, was cited as evidence that too much fluid had been given. * October 24, 1995: Anna Wood, a 15-year-old Australian schoolgirl, died from the effects of water intoxication secondary to use of MDMA (commonly known as ecstasy). * November 16, 1995: Leah Betts, an English schoolgirl, died as the result of drinking too much water, though in the media her death was mistakenly attributed to taking an ecstasy tablet at her 18th birthday party. * 2003: British actor Anthony Andrews survived a case of water intoxication. He was performing as Henry Higgins in a revival of the musical My Fair Lady at the time, and consumed up to eight litres of water a day. He was unconscious and in intensive care for three days. *February 2, 2005: Matthew Carrington, a student at Chico State University in Chico, California, died as a direct result of a fraternity hazing ritual involving forced water intoxication. *January 12, 2007: Jennifer Strange died after drinking nearly 2 gallons (7.6 liters) of water in an attempt to win a Nintendo Wii. The KDND radio station's morning show, the Morning Rave, held an on-air contest entitled \\"Hold Your Wee for a Wii,\\" in which contestants were asked to drink as much water as they could without urinating. The DJs were made aware of the dangers but did not inform the contestants. KDND's parent company Entercom Sacramento LLC was subsequently ordered to pay $16,577,118 in damages to Jennifer's family. * March 11, 2020: Zachary Sabin, an 11-year-old child, died after being forced to drink almost three liters of water in just four hours by his parents.

Gina Lee Barnes, „ÄäState Formation in Korea: Historical and Archaeological Perspectives„Äã, Psychology Press, 2001, , p.29-33 Arising out of the confluence of Gojoseon migration and the Jin state federation, Mahan was one of the Samhan (\\"Three Hans\\"), along with Byeonhan and Jinhan. Baekje began as a member statelet, but later overtook all of Mahan and became one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. History Mahan probably developed from the existing bronze society of third to second centuries BC, continuing to absorb migration from the north in subsequent centuries. King Jun of the kingdom of Gojoseon in northern Korea, having lost the throne to Wiman, fled to the state of Jin state in southern Korea around 194 - 180 BC. He and his followers are thought to have established a base within Jin territory. It is not certain whether Mahan conquered or arose out of this entity, but Mahan was certainly influenced by this influx of northern culture. Further migration followed the fall of Gojoseon and establishment of the Chinese commanderies in the Liaoning region in 108 BC. It is described in the Chinese chronicle San Guo Zhi and the much later Korean chronicles Samguk Yusa and Samguk Sagi. In the 1st century AD, the Wolji/Mokji (ÊúàÊîØ/ÁõÆÊîØ) state, that formed and led Mahan confederacy, was defeated in struggles with Baekje, another member of Mahan, and consequently losing whole region of present-day Han River basin. But the San Guo Zhi recorded the Han state fallen in struggles with the Lelang Commandery and Daifang Commandery in the 246.ÂÖ≥‰∫éÊ≠£Âßã‰∏ÉÂπ¥È≠èÈü©Êàò‰∫â‰πüË∞àÁáï„ÄÅÈü©„ÄÅÂê¥‰∏âËßíÂÖ≥Á≥ª‰∏≠ÁöÑÂá†‰∏™ÈóÆÈ¢ò Sarah M. Nelson,„ÄäThe Archaeology of Korea„Äã, p.170, Cambridge University Press, 1993 Under continuous pressure from Baekje, only 20 statelets of Mahan confederacy survived until the late 3rd century. Baekje eventually absorbed or conquered all of Mahan by the 5th century,È©¨Èü©ÁôæÊµéÂºÇÂè≤Êñô growing into one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, along with Silla and Goguryeo. Politics Kings of Mahan occasionally called themselves \\"King of Jin,\\" referring to the earlier Jin state and asserting nominal sovereignty over all of Samhan. A wealth of bronze artifacts and production facilities indicate that Mahan was probably the earliest developed of the three Hans. Sarah M. Nelson,„ÄäThe Archaeology of Korea„Äã, p.197, Cambridge University Press, 1993 At its height, Mahan covered much of the Han River Basin and the modern-day provinces of Gyeonggi, Chungcheong, and Jeolla, although political unity was strongest led by Mokji state (Î™©ÏßÄÍµ≠, ÁõÆÊîØÂúã) in Cheonan, Chungcheong.Korean National Commission for UNESCO, Korea Journal, Vol.3-4, 1963, p.8 Culture Legacy Goryeo historians identified Mahan with Goguryeo, which was supported by their works like Samguk Sagi, Samguk Yusa and Jewang Ungi. That historical view was previously given by Choe Chiwon, a noted Confucian scholar and Historian in the late of the Silla. Apart from the geographical location of Mahan, the Chinese historical record History of Song defines the ethnical origin of the Jeong-an kingdom, a successor state of Balhae, as Mahan. In the late Joseon period, that historical notion came under criticism by early Silhak scholar Han Baek-gyeom, who emphasized the linkage between Mahan and Baekje in terms of the geographical location.

In 2004 it became a member of the Inc. 500; while in 2005 Gratis broke into the top twenty at eighteen. Its name comes from the Latin word Gratis, meaning free of charge. History FreePay Logo Gratis Internet was established in 2001. Since July 2004, it has launched a number of Web sites offering free merchandise, most notably iPods, to users who register and complete membership requirements. Although the word \\"free\\" is used prominently, would-be members seeking to complete an offer to qualify for the free merchandise are often given a number of options, some of which involve signing up and paying for a service or subscription. Gratis has launched its Web sites in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, and Australia. Gratis's revenue in 2004 was US$20.5 million, according to Inc.com. Inc.com also reported that Gratis Internet had only 12 employees. In August 2005, Gratis Internet's multiple sites, including the original FreeCondoms.com and FreeIpods.com, were branded under the FreePay name.FreePay on CNN In March 2006, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer filed suit against the company, alleging that it sold personal information obtained from millions of consumers despite a strict promise of confidentiality. The suit followed a $1.1 million settlement by Datran Media, which had obtained 7.2 million names, e-mail addresses, home phone numbers, and street addresses from Gratis Internet. Gratis co-founder Peter Martin disputed that his company ever sold or rented out customer information, saying that it hired Datran Media to work on creative design and back-office support for its e-mail marketing campaigns. In May 2006, Gratis Internet announced new terms of service, allowing users only three months to complete an offer and refer five friends. In February 2010, a Gratis Internet spinout called Social Cash, an advertising network for Facebook applications, was purchased by LifeStreet Media, of San Carlos, Calif., for an undisclosed sum. Complaints In September 2004, the company was criticized by customers for failing to ship iPods, and for inundating them with additional spam e-mail. The company said it was shipping iPods, but that they could not get enough from Apple Computer to fill the demand. The co- founders, Peter Martin and Rob Jewell, denied giving customer e-mail information to third-party companies, but admitted customers do receive a small number of messages from select parties. \\"We warn our users they may get some messages from our marketing partners\\", Jewell said. As of November 2008, the company has an unsatisfactory record with the Better Business Bureau due to unanswered complaints. In the 36 months prior to November 2008, the Bureau had processed 848 complaints about Gratis Internet.BBB of Washington DC & Eastern PA: BBB Reliability Report  FreePay process  In order to receive the advertised \\"free gift\\" at each of Gratis' websites, a visitor is required to register and complete one affiliate offer. Affiliates include AOL, Blockbuster, RealNetworks, casino and credit card offers, and others. The affiliate offers typically consist of trial memberships, service subscriptions, credit card applications and the like; some require credit cards during registration, and a few involve payment of some kind, causing critics to claim the \\"free\\" label a misnomer. The visitor is then required to refer a set number of people, which varies by the product (the number required is usually the MSRP of the gift divided by US$50). A valid referral is one which has both completed registration via a referral link and signed up for an affiliate offer. Each referral must be a unique user or the account will be \\"put on hold\\" during the approval process. Because sponsors must acknowledge the completion of their offer, they are willing to invest more for each referral than they might for other, more traditional forms of advertising. The advertisers pay Gratis for the referral, between $25 and $90, though the company has not released information as to specific numbers. For example: assuming the MSRP of an iPod is $250, five affiliate signups (the number needed for one user to redeem a free iPod) nets Gratis between $150 and $540. Per the program's terms, Gratis does not need to deliver an iPod to any member with four or fewer referrals. Since Gratis Internet was created similar companies have been created offering similar incentives for completed offers. Gratis Internet and its initial service, FreeCondoms.com are credited with creating the incentive marketing industry.Rob Jewell from Gratis Internet, MeetInnovators See also *Free lunch *Tanstaafl References Category:Incentive marketing companies Category:Companies established in 2001 ","title":"Gratis Internet"},{"id":"1140153","text":"Bathurst Manor is a neighbourhood located in the North York district of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

In the summer of 1956, the valley below the ski hill was the site of Bathurst Manor Day Camp, later Forest Valley Day Camp, and now a part of the Forest Valley Outdoor Education Centre. At its peak, it was the largest privately owned summer day camp in Canada, with over 900 campers, and operated through 1993. In 1973 the grade ten students from Downsview Secondary School built a suspension bridge across the ravine as part of their workshop experience. The bridge was dismantled some years later when it was considered an insurance liability. Beginning in 1998, Camp NAORCA summer camp operated by Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division moved here from its previous location at Seneca College, King Campus, and the Toronto District School Board uses this space during the school year to educate 21,000 students per year. =Arts= Several works from the collection of the Koffler Centre of the Arts is housed at the BJCC's Koffler Gallery. The centre also provides visual arts studios, music and dance schools, and the Leah Posluns Theatre which is a 444-seat facility offering opera, theatre, dance, music and other cultural events. The Jewish Book Fair is held at the Centre annually. Much of David Bezmozgis's 2004 short story collection Natasha and Other Stories takes place in the general vicinity of the Bathurst Manor in the late 1980s. In one story, \\"Roman Berman - Massage Therapist\\", the title character takes an office in the medical building at Bathurst Manor Plaza, which is still standing and in use. Bezmozgis's narrator refers to the plaza as \\"Sunnybrook Plaza\\", after its anchor store at the time. Author Stuart Ross, who grew up in Bathurst Manor, set most of his 2011 novel, Snowball, Dragonfly, Jew (ECW Press), in Bathurst Manor. The book centres on the fictional assassination of a neo-Nazi in Bathurst Manor Plaza. References are made to many streets in Bathurst Manor, as well as stores in the plaza. =Retail= The major strip mall, Sheppard Plaza, is located at the intersection of Sheppard Avenue and Bathurst Street, and includes a Shoppers Drug Mart, TD Canada Trust, Bank of Montreal, Scotiabank, Metro supermarket. The store was formerly a Dominion, and before that a Miracle Food Mart, and originally a Steinberg's. Before that, it was a Grand Union. There was also a smaller Bathurst Manor Plaza shopping centre at the intersection of Wilmington and Overbrook. It had been in decline since the early 1990s since the closure of its anchor Sunnybrook produce store. It also featured a King David kosher pizzeria and The Bagel Nook coffee shop. These two stores shared a building that previously housed a Pioneer gas station, originally a Shell station, which closed in the late 1990s. The plaza formally closed on July 31, 2016, and is slated for eventual redevelopment, with no given timeframe. Notable people *Howie Mandel - comedian, actor, game show host *Herbert L.

Development Nikasil was introduced by Mahle in 1967, initially developed to allow Wankel engine apex seals (NSU Ro 80, Citro√´n GS Birotor and Mercedes C111) to work directly against the aluminium housing.http://www.grandprixengines.co.uk/Note_29.pdf This coating allowed aluminium cylinders and pistons to work directly against each other with low wear and friction. Unlike other methods, including cast iron cylinder liners, Nikasil allowed very large cylinder bores with tight tolerances and thus allowed existing engine designs to be expanded easily. The aluminium cylinders also gave a much better heat conductivity than cast iron liners, an important attribute for a high-output engine. The coating was further developed as a replacement for hard-chrome plated cylinder bores for Mercury Marine Racing, Kohler Engines, and as a repair replacement for factory-chromed snowmobiles, dirt bikes, ATVs, watercraft and automotive V8 liners/bores. Nikasil is short for Nickel Silicon Carbide. Silicon carbide is a very hard ceramic (much harder than steel) that can be dissolved in nickel. The nickel solution can then be electroplated onto the aluminium cylinder bore. The piston rings will then rub off the exposed nickel, leaving a very hard layer of silicon carbide to prevent the cast iron/steel piston rings directly contacting the aluminium cylinder. With this setup, the engine tolerances can be much tighter for better performance. The cylinder must be re-plated after it is re-bored, but Nikasil is extremely durable, so the cylinder does not need to be reworked as often as an iron or chrome cylinder. Applications Porsche started using Nikasil on the 1970 917 race car, and later on the 1973 911 RS. Porsche also used it on production cars, but for a short time switched to Alusil due to cost savings for their base 911. Nikasil cylinders were always used for the 911 Turbo and RS models. Nikasil coated aluminium cylinders allowed Porsche to build air-cooled engines that had the highest specific output of any engine of their time. Nikasil is still used in today's 911s. Nikasil was very popular in the 1990s. It was used by companies such as BMW, Ducati, Jaguar and Moto Guzzi in their new engine families. However, the sulfur found in much of the world's low-quality gasoline caused some Nikasil cylinders to break down over time, causing costly engine failures.http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a6643/top- automotive-engineering-failures-jaguar-nikasil-v8/ Nikasil or similar coatings under other trademarks are also still widely used in racing engines, including those used in Formula One and ChampCar.

He was active in the Virginias following the U.S. Civil War. Page was widely known as a metallurgical expert by other industry leaders and investors as well as state and federal authorities. William Page became one of the leading managers and developers of West Virginia's rich bituminous coalfields in the late-19th and early-20th century, as well as being deeply involved in building the railroads and other infrastructure necessary to process and transport the mined coal. Page often worked as a manager for absentee owners, such as the British geological expert, Dr. David T. Ansted, and the New York City mayor, Abram S. Hewitt of the Cooper-Hewitt organization and other New York and Boston financiers, or as the \\"front man\\" in projects involving a silent partner, such as Henry H. Rogers. In the town of Ansted, for 28 years, the Page family lived in a large Victorian mansion built by carpenters of the Gauley Mountain Coal Company. Most notable among Page's many accomplishments was a project to acquire land and construct a modest short-line railroad to tap new coal reserves in a rugged portion of southern West Virginia not yet reached by the bigger railroads. Connections planned to both the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;) and the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W;) should have inspired competition among rival carriers to transport the coal the rest of the way to market. However, collusion by the leaders of the large railroads attempted to stop the project through agreeing to only offer Page unprofitable rates. Instead of giving up, working with Rogers discreetly providing the millions needed for financing, William Page and his associates expanded the \\"short line\\" all the way hundred of miles across the Virginias to a new coal pier built on Hampton Roads, creating the Virginian Railway. Completed in 1909, the VGN was built to be very efficient and during the first half of the 20th century, became widely known as the \\"Richest Little Railroad in the World.\\" William and Emma completed their lives in Washington D.C., where they moved in 1917 as he served as a mining expert before federal regulators. One of their younger sons, Randolph Gilham \\"Dizzy\\" Page, was an early pioneer of the U.S. air mail industry during this time until his death of a heart attack at 36. William and Emma died in 1932 and 1933 respectively, and were interred in Richmond, Virginia's Hollywood Cemetery. A view of the Page-Vawter House in Ansted, West Virginia from the Midland Trail Early life, heritage of public service William Nelson Page was born at \\"Locust Grove\\" in Campbell County, Virginia on January 6, 1854 into an old Virginia family. His parents were Edwin Randolph Page (1822‚Äì1864) and Olivia (n√©e Alexander) Page (1820‚Äì1896), a scion of the Nelson family. He descended from historic roots; the Nelson and Page families were each among the \\"First Families of Virginia\\", families who were prominent in the Virginia Colony. Through the Nelson family, he was a descendant of Robert \\"King\\" Carter (1663‚Äì1732), who served as an acting royal governor of Virginia and was one of its wealthiest landowners in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. After the American Revolutionary War, two of his great-grandfathers served as Governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Some years later, in 1905, another relative, Logan Waller Page, became the first head of the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads, an early precursor of the agency which became the U.S. Department of Transportation. Logan Page served as an energetic advocate of the country's early interstate highway system until his death in 1918. Although his father died in 1861, and notwithstanding the financial hardships which were widespread in the South brought on by the Civil War which began that year, from a family base in Rockbridge and Augusta counties, where his mother and siblings relocated, young William Nelson Page was educated at the University of Virginia as a civil engineer. After the cessation of hostilities in 1865, as he launched his career, he participated in some local politics and civic activities, but primarily directed his considerable energies into developing transportation and mineral resources in the mountainous regions of Virginia and the newly formed state of West Virginia. Between 1871 and 1876, William Page played a role in engineering and building the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;), which was under the leadership of Collis P. Huntington. Initially, he led one of the surveying parties charged with mapping the route of a double- track railway that had been ordered by Congress. This new railway was expected to run between Richmond, Virginia and the Ohio River (at what became Huntington, West Virginia), via the valleys of the James River and Jackson River in Virginia, and the New River and Kanawha River in West Virginia. He chose the location and directed the construction of several important C&O; bridges. While working with the C&O;, Page became fascinated with the potential of the untapped mineral resources of West Virginia. Family and children William's father, a farmer, died in 1862, but his education continued. Olivia Page, William's widowed mother, owned several farms in Rockbridge County, Virginia, where she relocated. Both William and Emma had roots in the central Shenandoah Valley area named for nearby Natural Bridge. His future wife, Emma Hayden Gilham (1855‚Äì1933), had been born at Lexington in Rockbridge County, Virginia. She was the youngest daughter of Major William Gilham, a former Commandant of the Virginia Military Institute (VMI). Emma's parents moved to Richmond at the outset of the American Civil War, where her father helped with Virginia and Confederate troop training. after the end of hostilities in 1865, he worked for a fertilizer company. He died in 1872. On February 8, 1882, Page married Emma Hayden Gilham (1855‚Äì1933) in Richmond, Virginia. By this time, William had become well-established in the region and had been named as General Manager and a Director of the Gauley Mountain Coal Company at the urging of an old friend and trustee, attorney Thomas D. Ransom of Staunton, Virginia. Emma and William settled in the town of Ansted in Fayette County, West Virginia, where they raised their family, which included four children who lived beyond infancy. Their palatial white Victorian mansion was built by Gauley Mountain Coal Company carpenters, on a knoll in the middle of town. Later known as the Page-Vawter House, it remained has been preserved and restored and remained as a community landmark as of 2010. Entrepreneur and developer Bituminous coal A knowledgeable man with the training and experience as a civil engineer and the spirit of an entrepreneur, Page was well-prepared to help develop West Virginia's hidden wealth: huge deposits of \\"smokeless\\" bituminous coal, a product exceptionally well-suited for making steel. Former West Virginia Governor William A. MacCorkle described him as a man who knew the land \\"as a farmer knows a field.\\" Page became a prot√©g√© of Dr. David T. Ansted, a noted British geologist with large land holdings in southern West Virginia. As his career developed, Page busied himself with many enterprises to develop the natural resources which lay all around him, primarily working with iron and coal operations, often as the manager for absentee owners. He was the general manager of the Hawks Nest Coal Co. between 1877 and 1880, superintendent of the Victoria Blast Furnace at Goshen, Virginia from 1880 to 1885, and he located and built the Powellton bridge for the C&O; between 1885 and 1889. After developing the Mt. Carbon Collieries, he organized and developed the Gauley Mountain Coal Company, and he became a consulting engineer for other coal-producing firms as well. He was also involved with the Virginia and Pittsburgh Land Association (a land development company) and the Pittsburgh and Virginia Railroad Company. Of course, with his background with the C&O;, Page was intensely interested in railroads, and he gained even more practical railroad experience after winning the contract to convert the C&O; branch-line track, from the New River main line, up the mountainside to Ansted, to standard gauge. The project was completed on 20 August 1890, at a cost of $35,038.44. He was later a principal of the Page Coal and Coke Company. The \\"idea man from Ansted\\" William and Emma Page settled their family in the tiny mountain hamlet of Ansted, a town with a population of 2,000 (named for Dr. Ansted) located in Fayette County, West Virginia. Ansted sits on high bluffs on Gauley Mountain near an outcropping of rocks called Hawk's Nest overlooking the New River far below, where the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway tracks occupied both sides of the narrow valley. In the late 1870s, Emma and William's widowed mother, Olivia Page, who had come to live with them, were influential in establishing the Church of the Redeemer, the Episcopal Church in Ansted. In 1889, while he was president of the Gauley Mountain Coal Company, Page had a palatial white Victorian mansion built by company carpenters on a knoll in the middle of town. Architect William Minter designed the house in a Gothic style. It has 15 regular rooms, plus a butler's pantry and a dressing room. There are 11 fireplaces with hand- carved wooden mantels; most are in different styles. Even the doors have ornately decorated hinges. The exterior features 52 8-foot-tall windows. The mansion, now known as the Page-Vawter House, became a symbol of wealth and power. It remains a community landmark over 100 years later. \\"Colonel\\" Page, as he became known, was in truth, a uniformed captain and later a major in a locally recruited Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War militia. (\\"Colonel\\" was an honorific title used informally in the South for many notable men in the years following the American Civil War). A colorful character by all accounts, he was described as a slight man who was known for his handlebar mustache, pince-nez glasses, iron bowler derby, and elegant suits. He was considered to be somewhat aloof by the local population, and could frequently be seen riding a bicycle on the sloping lawn of the mansion, where eight servants were employed. Described years later by author H. Reid as \\"the idea man from Ansted,\\" Page spent long hours working in the den just off the main entrance to his resplendent home. In addition to pursuing business interests, Page also found time to serve as the mayor of Ansted for 10 years and rose to the rank of brigadier inspector general in the West Virginia National Guard. In 1907, he was named as the first president of Ansted National Bank. He was also an incorporator and director of Sheltering Arms Hospital in neighboring Kanawha County. However, of all of his many activities, William Nelson Page is probably best known for the founding and building of the Virginian Railway (VGN). It started much like just another of his many projects, but would ultimately grow far beyond its original scope. The story of the building of the Virginian Railway has been described as a textbook example of natural resources, railroads, and a smaller company taking on big business (and winning) early in the 20th century. Building the Virginian Railway Some historians will hold that the Loup Creek enterprise originally was planned to be just another local mining operation, one that would ship primary product, coal, out of the region via the common carrier railroads. Officially, it was only after problems arose that the plan was expanded to build and operate rail connections, or even build all the way to the sea. This is the version Page used in an I.C.C. hearing. However, other historians believe that a goal of the plan from the outset was to transport from the mineheads to reach a shipping point without using these common carriers, who as owners of vast coal lands and many mines, were also competitors. There was a lot at stake, as the C&O; and the N&W; through the secret \\"community of interests\\" pact were carefully controlling coal shipping rates. A non-affiliated competitor would threaten that cozy relationship. The Virginian Railway Most notable among Page's many projects was a partnership with absentee investors, begun in 1898, to acquire land and construct a modest short-line railroad to tap new coal reserves in a rugged portion of southern West Virginia not yet reached by the bigger railroads. The project was intended to establish connections to both the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O;) and the Norfolk and Western Railway (N&W;), which should have inspired competition among rival carriers to transport the coal the rest of the way to market. However, collusion by the leaders of the large railroads (lawful in an era before U.S. anti-trust laws were enacted) resulted in rates to transport the coal the additional distances to markets which, potentially, would have stopped the project. However, if the C&O; and N&W; presidents thought they could discourage Page from developing the new areas, they were mistaken. One of the silent investors Page had enlisted was millionaire industrialist Henry Huttleston Rogers, a principal in John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust. A master at competitive \\"warfare\\", Henry Rogers did not like to lose, and, as one of the wealthiest men in America, he also had nearly unlimited resources. A view of the Page-Vawter House in Ansted, West Virginia from the Midland Trail While Page continued to meet with the big railroads for rate negotiations that always seemed unproductive, he and Rogers secretly planned a route and acquired rights-of- way all of the way across Virginia to Hampton Roads, a distance of some . By the time they realized what was happening, the C&O; and N&W; executives were faced with a new major competitor, a third railroad with direct access to an ocean port. =Victoria is created= This aerial shot of Victoria was taken in 1954 looking west. It shows the turntable and roundhouse in the lower left, and the passenger station and Norfolk division offices to the right of the tracks. Late in 1906, near the halfway point on the Tidewater Railway between Roanoke and Sewell's Point, a new town with space set aside for railroad offices and shops was created in Lunenburg County, Virginia. It was named Victoria, in honor of Queen Victoria of England, who was long-admired by Henry Rogers. Victoria was the location of a large equipment maintenance operation, with roundhouse, turntable, coaling and water facilities for servicing steam locomotives, a large rail yard with many tracks, and a large single-story passenger station. Offices for the VGN's Norfolk Division were built by adding a second floor to the passenger station building a few years later. =Virginian Railway born, Jamestown Exposition= Early in 1907, with substantial portions of each still under construction, the Deepwater and Tidewater Railways were combined to become the Virginian Railway. On April 15, 1907, William Nelson Page was elected as its first president. About the same time, a large stretch of the eastern portion of the Tidewater had been completed and regular passenger service was established between Norfolk and Victoria. This proved just in time for the new railroad to serve the Jamestown Exposition, which was held on land adjacent to the VGN coal pier site at Sewell's Point. At the exposition, Page served as Chief of International Jury of Awards, Mines and Metallurgy. On April 26, 1907, US President Theodore Roosevelt opened the exposition. Mark Twain was another honored guest, arriving with his friend Henry Rogers on the latter's steam yacht, the Kanawha. In addition to President Roosevelt, the newly renamed Virginian Railway (VGN) transported many of the 3 million persons who attended before the Exposition closed on December 1, 1907. =Financial panic of 1907 ‚Äì Rogers has stroke= Work progressed on the VGN during 1907 and 1908 using construction techniques not available when the larger railroads had been built about 25 years earlier, achieving a more favorable route and grade. By paying for work with Henry Rogers' own personal fortune, the railway was built with no public debt. This feat, a key feature of the successful secrecy in securing the route, was in all likelihood not part of Rogers' initial planning, and was not accomplished without some considerable burden to the financier, however. He had suffered some setbacks in the Financial Panic of 1907 which began in March of that year. Then, a few months later, he experienced a debilitating apoplectic stroke. Fortunately, Henry Rogers recovered his health, at least partially, and saw to it that construction was continued on the new railroad until it was finally completed early in 1909. =Final spike, celebrations= The final spike in the VGN was driven on 29 January 1909, at the west end of the massive New River Bridge at Glen Lyn, near where the new railroad crossed the West Virginia-Virginia state line. The former Deepwater and Tidewater Railways were now physically connected. In April, 1909, Henry Huttleston Rogers and Mark Twain, old friends, returned to Norfolk together once again for a huge celebration of the new \\"Mountains to the Sea\\" railroad's completion. Despite rain that day, a huge crowd of Norfolk citizens was waiting with great excitement at the shore to meet them. While Rogers toured the railway's new $2.5-million coal pier at Sewell's Point, Mark Twain spoke to groups of students at several local schools. That night, at a grand banquet held in downtown Norfolk, the city's civic leaders, Mark Twain, Rogers, and other dignitaries spoke. In either event, with the building of the VGN, what was accomplished was that a third shipper was established. Rogers left the next day on his first (and only) tour of the newly completed railroad. He died suddenly, only six weeks later, at the age of 69, at his home in New York, because of another stroke. By then, the work of the Page-Rogers partnership in Building the Virginian Railway was complete. Accomplishments While neither William Page nor Henry Rogers ended up running their newly completed Virginian Railway, it was arguably a crowning lifetime achievement for each man. Together, they had conceived and built a modern, well-engineered rail pathway from the coal mines of West Virginia to port at Hampton Roads right under the noses of the big railroads. The Virginian Railway could operate more efficiently than its larger competitors, had all new infrastructure, and no debt. It was an accomplishment like no other in the history of US railroading, before or since. The new railroad opened up isolated communities in both West Virginia and Virginia and soon helped develop new coalfields and other industries. Throughout its profitable 50-year history, the VGN continued to follow the Page-Rogers policy of \\"paying up front for the best.\\" It became particularly well known for treating its employees and vendors well, another investment which paid rich dividends. The VGN operated some of the largest and most innovative steam, electric, and diesel locomotives, and could afford to, earning the nickname \\"Richest Little Railroad in the World.\\" In time, the big railroads learned to coexist with their newer competitor, and came to regret turning down opportunities to purchase it before completion. There were many failed attempts by each of them and others to acquire the VGN. Eventually, the owners of the VGN agreed to merge with arch-rival Norfolk and Western Railway in 1959. In 2004, much of the former Virginian Railway is still in use by N&W; successor Norfolk Southern Railway (NS). The well-engineered low-gradient VGN route helps NS compete efficiently with rival CSX Transportation (successor to the VGN's old rival C&O;) and non-rail transport modes in the transportation markets of the 21st century. The latter years After the Virginian Railway had been completed, Page busied himself with the coal-mining business in West Virginia, until he retired in 1917. He and his family then moved to Washington, D.C. William Nelson Page died at his home in Washington, in 1932, at the age of 78. He was interred in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia, where his wife, Emma, who died the following 14 February, is also buried. Ancestry =Nelson family lineage= The Nelson lineage in Virginia began with Thomas \\"Scotch Tom\\" Nelson (1677‚Äì1745), a Scottish immigrant who settled at Yorktown in 1690. He was from Penrith (in present-day Cumbria). His son, William Nelson (1711‚Äì1772) was a royal governor of Virginia. William Nelson's son, Thomas Nelson, Jr. (1739‚Äì1789) (grandson of \\"Scotch Tom\\") was a signer of the Declaration of Independence, a Brigadier General during the American Revolutionary War and a governor after statehood. Nelson County, Kentucky (formerly in Virginia before Kentucky became a state), Nelson County, Virginia and Thomas Nelson Community College in the Virginia Peninsula subregion of Hampton Roads are each named in honor of Thomas Nelson, Jr. His son, Hugh Nelson (1768‚Äì1836) would later serve in the U.S. Congress. The circa 1730 Nelson House built by \\"Scotch Tom\\" Nelson in Yorktown, Virginia is a National Historical Landmark maintained by the Colonial National Historical Park of the U.S. National Park Service. =Page family lineage= The Page family lineage in Virginia began even earlier, in 1650, with the arrival from England of Colonel John Page (1628‚Äì1692) at Jamestown. He was from Middlesex (in the present London borough of Hounslow). Colonel Page was a prominent leader and developer of Middle Plantation, which became the site of the new College of William and Mary (chartered in 1693). Middle Plantation was soon thereafter designated as the new state capital and renamed Williamsburg. The Page family included Mann Page (1749‚Äì1781), who became a U.S. Congressman in the new nation, as well as Governor John Page (1744‚Äì1808), who had grown up at Rosewell Plantation in Gloucester County. He was a classmate at the College of William and Mary with a young Thomas Jefferson, who stayed at his home while working on the early documents relating to independence for Virginia and the other colonies. Later notable members of the Page family included U.S. Navy officer (and later Confederate Naval Commander and Army Brigadier General Richard Lucian Page (1807‚Äì1901) of Clarke County, Virginia, and William's cousin, writer and U.S. Ambassador Thomas Nelson Page (1853‚Äì1922). In Williamsburg, Virginia, Page Street is named for Colonel John Page. Page County, Virginia was named in honor of Governor John Page. =Young cousins: Thomas Nelson Page and William Nelson Page= Among young William Nelson Page's contemporaries born in the mid-19th century was his first cousin, Thomas Nelson Page (1853‚Äì1922), of Beaverdam in Hanover County. Although once among Virginia's wealthy elite, their respective family fortunes had diminished greatly by the time cousins William and Thomas Page were teenagers after the American Civil War devastated Virginia's economy. Conflicts and battles of the War ravaged the area all around Thomas' home, while William's family lived about to the southwest, in an area of the state less directly impacted. However, during the War, when William was only 10 years old, his father, Edwin Randolph Page, died at their home \\"Locust Grove\\" in Campbell County, where he is interred in a family cemetery. William had two sisters, one slightly older, one younger, when his father died. The Page cousins, Thomas and William, were each educated by the University of Virginia. Thomas, educated as a lawyer, was to gain fame writing of the \\"lost era\\" and an idealized antebellum Virginia (a style which became known as the plantation tradition genre). In addition to practicing law, he also served as a politician. In the administration of President Woodrow Wilson, he was the U.S. ambassador to Italy during World War I. Meanwhile, William, a year younger, was tutored at home as a youngster, and then was sent to Northern Virginia where he attended Leesburg Academy in the Town of Leesburg, county seat of Loudoun county, and not far from the home of his paternal grandparents in Clarke County. He then attended special courses in engineering of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, and became a civil engineer. =Page's wife, Emma, and her family= William Page's wife, Emma, was one of seven children of Major William Gilham and his wife, Cordelia A Gilham. In 1860, her father prepared a well-known training manual for recruits and militia at the request of Virginia Governor Henry A. Wise, and was involved with early training of cadets at Camp Lee in Richmond, Virginia as the American Civil War broke out the following year. After the War ended in 1865, William Gilham became president of fertilizer company in Richmond. Emma spent her teen-aged years in the former Confederate capital, where she was a d√©butante at one of Richmond's earliest \\"Germans\\", which were formal social gatherings for the young people (the name of these events had no relationship to Germany). She was the sister of Julius Hayden Gilham (1852‚Äì1936) who is also buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia. William Page and Emma Gilham both had roots and family in the Augusta County and Rockbridge County area of the upper Shenandoah Valley. (William's married sister lived in Staunton, Virginia.) They had four children who survived childhood: Delia Hayden Page (born 1882), Edwin Randolph Page (1884‚Äì1949), Mary Josephine Page (1893‚Äì1962), and Randolph Gilham Page (1893‚Äì1930). They also had two other children who died in infancy: Evan Powell Page (born 1887) and William Gilham Page (born 1890). Legacy The unincorporated West Virginia coal and railroad towns of Page in Fayette County and Pageton in McDowell County were named for him. The Page Coal and Coke Company operated in each, although coal mining has long since ended. The old company store in Pageton is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In the 21st century, William and Emma's mansion, now known as the Page-Vawter House, still stands in Ansted, on a high knoll, overlooking the town and the New River Valley. It is evidence of the once-thriving coal business. Later occupied by the Vawter family, the Page- Vawter House is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Nearby, breathtaking Hawk's Nest overlooks the New River Gorge National River. The seemingly remotely located terminal Page and Rogers planned and built at Sewell's Point played an important role in 20th-century U.S. naval history. Beginning in 1917, the former Jamestown Exposition grounds adjacent to the VGN coal pier became an important facility for the United States Navy. The VGN transported the high quality \\"smokeless\\" West Virginia bituminous coal favored by the US Navy for its ships and submarines, providing a reliable supply during both World Wars. Today, the former VGN property at Sewell's Point is part of the Norfolk Navy Base, the largest naval facility in the world. USS William N. Page 1918‚Äì19 After Page retired in 1917, a ship was named in his honor. William N. Page was a steamship built at Camden, New Jersey, by the New York Ship Building and Dry Dock Corp. It was taken over by the US Navy for operation by the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS) and commissioned on December 18, 1918. After fitting out, William N. Page loaded general cargo and locomotives and departed for France. She made several transatlantic trips through the treacherous German U-boat infested waters before finally returning to Norfolk where on May 31, 1919, she was decommissioned by the Navy. After her brief naval career, the William N. Page remained in active merchant service for nearly three decades. Her successive owners and operators included the Mystic Steamship Co., the Koppers Coal Co., and Eastern Gas and Fuel Associates. The latter two companies were majority owners of the Virginian Railway after purchasing a controlling interest from Rogers' heirs in 1936. Formed in 2002, Virginian Railway (VGN) Enthusiasts a non-profit group of preservationists, authors, photographers, historians, modelers, and rail fans, has grown to over 650 members. Members come from as far from the VGN tracks as Australia and include U.S. troops stationed in the war-torn Middle East. A group of retired railroaders calling themselves \\"The Virginian Brethren\\" meet weekly, share tales of the VGN, and answer questions posed by members of the on-line group. In 2005, the initials \\"H.H.R.\\" and 'W.N.P.\\" were engraved in the rails of a short stretch of new roadbead laid for a caboose to be displayed at Victoria, a town they caused to be founded on the \\"Mountains to Sea\\" railroad. Their Virginian Railway has turned out to be a lasting tribute, both to Henry Huttleston Rogers, and to William Nelson Page, the \\"Idea Man from Ansted\\".

It is located at 17th and Wynkoop Streets in the present-day LoDo district and includes the historic terminal building, a train shed, a 22-gate underground bus facility, and light rail station.Welcome to the New Union Station. Regional Transportation District. Retrieved 06 December 2014. A station was first opened on the site on June 1, 1881, but burnt down in 1894. The current structure was erected in two stages, with an enlarged central portion completed in 1914. In 2012, the station underwent a major renovation transforming it into the centerpiece of a new transit-oriented mixed-use development built on the site's former railyards.Denver Union Station History and Timeline . Denver Union Station Project Authority. Retrieved 06 December 2014. The station house reopened in the summer of 2014, hosting the 112-room Crawford Hotel, several restaurants and retailers, and a train hall. History =19th century: Original structures= Looking down 17th Street towards the second Union Station building and the Mizpah Arch, circa 1908. Denver's first train station was constructed in 1868 to serve the new Denver Pacific Railway, which connected Denver to the main transcontinental line at Cheyenne, Wyoming. By 1875, there were four different railroad stations, making passenger transfers between different railroad lines inconvenient. To remedy this issue, the Union Pacific Railroad proposed creating one central \\"Union Station\\" to combine the various operations. In February 1880, the owners of the four lines (the Union Pacific, the Denver & Rio Grande, the Denver, South Park & Pacific and the Colorado Central) agreed to build a station at 17th and Wynkoop Streets. Architect A. Taylor of Kansas City was hired to develop the plans and the station opened in May 1881.Stevens, Mark E., Denver Union Station National Register of Historic Places Nomination, August 1974; p. 2. A fire that started in the women's restroom in 1894 destroyed the central portion of the 1881 depot. The Kansas City architectural firm of Van Brunt & Howe was hired to design a larger replacement depot in the Romanesque Revival style. Both the 1881 and 1894 depots included a tall central clock tower with four clock faces.Stevens, Mark E., Denver Union Station National Register of Historic Places Nomination, August 1974, p. 3. =Early 20th century= On July 4, 1906, a large arch was dedicated in front of the station in order to provide a symbolic threshold for travelers entering and leaving the city. Constructed at a cost of $22,500 with 70 tons of steel and over 2,000 light bulbs, the arch originally featured the word \\"Welcome\\" on both sides. The elevation facing 17th Street was changed to \\"Mizpah\\", a Hebrew word expressing an emotional bond between separated people, and used as a farewell to people leaving Denver. In 1912, the original Union Depot partnership was dissolved and replaced by the Denver Terminal Railway Company, representing the then-major operators of the station (the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe, the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific, the Colorado & Southern, the Union Pacific and the Denver & Rio Grande Western railways). The new partnership decided to demolish and rebuild the central portion of the station to handle the increasing passenger traffic. The new central portion, designed by Denver architects Gove & Walsh, was built in the Beaux-Arts style and opened in 1914.Fraser, Clayton, and Jennifer Strand. Railroads in Colorado, 1858‚Äì1948. Loveland, Colorado: Fraserdesign, 1997, p. 161. By the 1920s and 1930s, over 80 trains served the station daily with notable dignitaries such as Queen Marie of Romania, Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft and Franklin Delano Roosevelt arriving to Denver through the station. As a result of growing passenger service, the Mizpah Arch in front of the station was deemed a traffic hazard and was torn down in 1931. =Late 20th century: Decline= The Rio Grande Zephyr at Union Station, 1980 Denver Ski Train, 2003 Although World War II saw a surge in rail traffic, the latter half of the 20th century saw a sharp decline in service for Union Station and countless other train stations in the United States as competition began to grow from automobiles and airlines. For the first time in 1958, passenger traffic at Stapleton International Airport exceeded that of Union Station. It was during this period that the orange \\"Union Station: Travel by Train\\" signs were placed on both sides of the building to advertise intercity rail travel. Amtrak eventually became the sole provider of rail service through the station, operating only two trains daily between Chicago and the Bay Area with the California Zephyr. From the 1980s to the early 2000s, RTD, the City and County of Denver, the original site owner Denver Union Terminal Railway Corporation, and several other entities made periodic improvements such as accommodating an RTD bus lane to access Market Street Station from I-25 and a light rail connection to the C Line. The station also served special trains such as the Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad's Ski Train, which operated until the end of the winter of 2008‚Äì2009; in September 2009, plans were announced to revive the service as a special limited route beginning in December, but this fell through due to insurance problems. Until the grand renovation, the station served the annual Cheyenne Frontier Days Train, which runs between Denver and Cheyenne, Wyoming for the Frontier Days Rodeo event. The popular excursion train was later relocated to a site near the Denver Coliseum, where it continued to operate until being discontinued in 2019. =21st century: Renovations= Redevelopment The open air train hall and the historic terminal building, 2014 Station logo In 2001, RTD purchased Union Station and the surrounding site of its old rail yards from the Denver Union Terminal Railway Corporation under a jointly-funded agreement between RTD, the City and County of Denver, the Colorado Department of Transportation, and the Denver Regional Council of Governments, known as the Partner Agencies. A master plan was developed in 2002 that envisioned both the building and surrounding 19.5 acre (79,000 m¬≤) site be redeveloped as the hub of a multi-modal transportation network with transit-oriented private development. The plan was approved by the Partner Agencies in 2004 and was approved by voters in November of that year as the new FasTracks program. After a competition in 2006, the Partner Agencies selected the private Union Station Neighborhood Company as the master developer of the entire site. Its plan called for the transit elements connected to Union Station in the master plan to be constructed in one single phase at an estimated cost of $500 million. In 2008, Hargreaves Associates and Skidmore, Owings & Merrill were selected to design the public spaces including the landscape, train hall, bus terminal, and light rail stations. The project had also received federal funding on July 30, 2010 when a $300 million grant from the United States Department of Transportation helped fund construction of three light-rail tracks and eight heavy-rail tracks for both intercity and commuter rail services, as well as additional storage and servicing capabilities. As construction of the site commenced in 2010, Amtrak's passenger station and boarding platform were moved on February 1, 2011 to a temporary station at 21st and Wewatta streets, behind Coors Field. This temporary relocation lasted until February 28, 2014, when Amtrak's ticketing and passenger services returned to the station. The new light rail station was the first component of the project to be opened on August 15, 2011, two blocks west of the former light rail stations and adjacent to the consolidated main line railroad tracks near the Denver Millennium Bridge. The westernmost stop of the 16th Street Mall shuttle, also known as the MallRide, was also moved west adjacent to the new light rail stop. The new underground 22-gate Union Station Bus Concourse opened on May 11, 2014. On that same day, Market Street Station at 16th St. & Market St. closed permanently after thirty years of use as RTD's bus transit hub. All bus service from Market Street Station was re-routed to Union Station from that day forward. The California Zephyr, 2016 While most of the transit elements of the project have been completed to date, several commuter rail lines will begin service in the open air train hall in 2016. Service between Union Station and Denver International Airport began in April 2016 on the University of Colorado A-Line, running every 15 minutes during peak hours with a travel time of approximately 40 minutes. Service between Denver and Westminster began in July 2016 on the first segment of the B Line, which runs every 30 minutes during peak hours. The travel time between the two stations is approximately 11 minutes. Restoration of historic building Union Station building during renovations, September 2013 The renovated terminal building lit for the holidays, December 2014 Simultaneous with the construction of its surrounding site, the historic terminal building also underwent a complete renovation. In 2011, a competition between the Denver Union Station Neighborhood Company and the Union Station Alliance (consisting of local firms Urban Neighborhoods Inc., Sage Hospitality, Larimer Associates, REGen, llc. and McWhinney) created different proposals for the future use of the structure. Both plans called for maintaining a waiting area for transit and spaces for Amtrak, the creation of retail spaces, and integrating the interior spaces with the public plazas facing the station. However, the Denver Union Station Neighborhood plan also envisioned a public market and commercial office space while the Union Station Alliance called for the integration of an independent hotel with an emphasis on creating the Great Hall as \\"Denver's Living Room\\". By 2012, RTD selected the proposal from the Union Station Alliance to renovate the structure as a hotel at a cost of $54 million with retail, public, and transit facilities and approved a 99-year lease for its redevelopment. The main historic building closed to the public on December 1, 2012, for construction and re-opened July 26, 2014. The majority of the terminal building's upper levels have now become the 112-room Crawford Hotel, with the Great Hall on the ground level serving as the hotel lobby, public space, and train waiting room and an additional of the ground level serving as 10 independent retail and restaurantss.Jaffe, Mark (July 13, 2014) \\"Denver's renovated Union Station has been a 30-year barn- raising\\" The Denver Post Architecture =Layout= The open-air train hall, December 2015 As an inter-modal transportation hub, Denver Union Station consists of the historic terminal building and, on the site's former rail yards, an open-air train hall, a 22-gate underground bus terminal, and a light rail station. The train hall stands immediately behind the historic building and houses tracks for Amtrak and the commuter rail lines. An entrance between the train hall and the historic building lead directly to the underground bus terminal, which stretches west for two city blocks along 17th Street until it terminates at an above-ground light rail station. Street-level pavilions at the light rail stop/Chestnut Place, Wewatta Street and at each platform in the train hall provide additional vertical circulation to the bus terminal. Each of these transportation elements are tied together above ground by major public spaces and landscape elements such as the 17 St. Promenade/Gardens, Wynkoop Plaza and several other public plazas. Historically, a subterranean passage accessed through the northern wing building connected the station to the old rail platforms above. However, the passage and its entrance was demolished with the construction of the bus terminal. =Historic building= Interior view of the renovated Great Hall The present-day Union Station building consists mainly of two lower wing buildings flanking a larger central mass built during different parts of the station's history. The wing buildings were built with the first 1881 structure in a Romanesque Revival style, featuring tall, narrow windows, rusticated stonework and motifs of Colorado's state flower, the columbine. When the station was gutted by the 1894 fire, the facades of the wing buildings were incorporated into the 1894 depot and the 1914 renovation. They originally functioned as offices and other facilities for the station through its history, although today the structures house guestrooms for the Crawford Hotel and several restaurants. When originally constructed, the Great Hall also included three large chandeliers and ten long wooden benches that incorporated heating and lighting into their framework. While the renovation saw the return of similar chandeliers as the originals, it also saw the removal of the benches due to asbestos. Other modifications made during 2012 included changing the brown and tan color scheme of the interior to a more neutral white. The old ticket counters and offices were also converted into the Terminal Bar along with several retail and restaurant spaces being created on the periphery of and opening on to the Great Hall. In general, the 2012 renovation sought to create \\"Denver's Living Room\\" in the Great Hall by diversifying its functions. It functions today as part hotel lobby, part Amtrak, part waiting area, part retail, and part public space.

From 1983 to 2005, he led the Sudan People's Liberation Army during the Second Sudanese Civil War, and following a peace agreement he briefly served as First Vice President of Sudan for 3 weeks until his death in a helicopter crash on 30 July 2005. A developmental economist by profession, Garang was a major influence on the movement that led to the foundation of South Sudan. Early life and education Garang, who is regarded as the founding father and symbol of unity in today's South Sudan is a member of the Dinka ethnic group. He was born into a poor family in Wangulei village Twic East County in the upper Nile region of Sudan. An orphan by the age of ten, he had his fees for school paid by a relative, going to schools in Wau and then Rumbek. In 1962 he joined the first Sudanese civil war, but because he was so young, the leaders encouraged him and others his age to seek an education. Because of the ongoing fighting, Garang was forced to complete his secondary education in Tanzania. After winning a scholarship, he went on to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics in 1969 from Grinnell College in Iowa, United States. He was offered another scholarship to pursue graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, but chose to return to Tanzania and study East African agricultural economics as a Thomas J. Watson Fellow at the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM). At UDSM, he was a member of the University Students' African Revolutionary Front. However, Garang soon decided to return to Sudan and join the rebels.. There is much erroneous reporting that Garang met and befriended Yoweri Museveni, future president of Uganda, at this time; while both Garang and Museveni were students at UDSM in the 1960s, they did not attend at the same time., p. 80. In 1970, Garang was in one of the batches of Gordon Muortat Mayen's soldiers, the then leader of the Anyanya liberation movement, sent to Israel for military training. The civil war ended with the Addis Ababa Agreement of 1972 and Garang, like many rebels, was absorbed into the Sudanese military. For eleven years, he was a career soldier and rose from the rank of captain to colonel after taking the Infantry Officers Advanced Course at Fort Benning, Georgia, United States. During this period he took four years academic leave and received a Master's degree in agricultural economics from Iowa State University (ISU). In 1981, he earned a PhD in Economics from Iowa State University (ISU). By 1983, Col. Garang was serving as a senior instructor in the military academy in Wadi Sayedna 21 km from the centre of Omdurman where he instructed the cadets for more than four years. Later he was nominated to serve in the military research department at Army HQ in Khartoum.  Political ideology  Garang coined the philosophy of \\"Sudanism\\"A Speech by John Garang - FULL (YouTube) which would be the guiding philosophy to a secular and multiethnic New Sudan. He believed, for the people of Sudan to live in cohesion, they must not separate themselves into the many existing ethnic factions present within the nation but, rather, to collectively renounce the belief that Arabness, Black African-ness, Islam or Christianity were to be the ultimate defining characteristics of Sudan. Rather, he willed that citizens should embrace all cultures of Sudan, and to unify under the one commonality they all share, being Sudanese. Rebel leader In 1983, Garang went to Bor, ostensibly to pacify 500 southern government soldiers in Battalion 105 who were resisting being rotated to posts in the north. However, Garang was already part of a conspiracy among some officers in the Southern Command arranging for the defection of Battalion 105 to the anti-government rebels. When the government attacked Bor in May and the battalion pulled out, Garang rode by an alternative route to join them in the rebel stronghold in Ethiopia. By the end of July, Garang had brought over 3000 rebel soldiers under his control through the newly created Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement (SPLA/M), which was opposed to military rule and Islamic dominance of the country, and encouraged other army garrisons to mutiny against the Islamic law imposed on the country by the government.Johnson, D. The Root Causes of Sudan's Civil Wars, Indiana University Press, 2003, pp. 61‚Äì2. William Nyuon Bany and Kerubino Kwanyin Bol were both founding members of SPLA. Bany was appointed the 3rd high-ranking Commander after Bol. This action marked the commonly agreed upon the beginning of the Second Sudanese Civil War, which resulted in one and a half million deaths over twenty years of conflict. Although Garang was Christian and most of southern Sudan is non-Muslim (mostly animist), he did not initially focus on the religious aspects of the war. John Garang of Sudan Garang was a strong advocate for national unity: minorities together formed a majority and therefore should rule. Together, Garang believed, they could replace President Omar al-Bashir with a government made up of representatives from ‚Äúall tribes and religions in Sudan.\\" His first real effort for the cause, under his command, occurred in July 1985 with the SPLA‚Äôs incursion into Kordofan.Cockett, R., 2010, Sudan: Darfur and the Failure of an African State, Yale UP. The SPLA gained the backing of Libya, Uganda, and Ethiopia. Garang and his army controlled a large part of the southern regions of the country, named \\"New Sudan\\". He claimed his troops' courage came from \\"the conviction that we are fighting a just cause. That is something North Sudan and its people don't have.\\" Critics suggested financial motivations to his rebellion, noting that much of Sudan's oil wealth lies in the south of the country. In the spring of 1991, Mengistu Haile Mariam's regime (in Ethiopia) was overthrown by the Khartoum backed Ethiopian rebels (Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front). Upon the rebels‚Äô seizure of the government, they closed all SPLA training camps in Ethiopia and cut off the SPLA's arms supply, forcing the SPLA to return hundreds of thousands of Sudanese back to South Sudan. This disrupted military operations and leadership within the SPLA. However, this caused the West to reconsider relations with the SPLA ‚Äì justifying their providing the SPLA with \\"non-lethal help.\\"Flint, J. and Alex de Waal, 2008 (2nd Edn), Darfur: A New History of a Long War, Zed Books. Shortly after, there was an attempted coup to oust Garang by senior SPLA commanders, Riek Machar and Lam Akol, in August 1991. The splinter group led by Machar and Akol was named the SPLA-Nasir. The coup turned out to be premature ‚Äì however, it did expose the deep ethnic divides within the SPLA. The Southern Sudanese communities became more divided than ever before in their history. These organic divides among the Southern Sudanese communities were exacerbated by the deliberate \\"divide and rule\\" policies instituted by the regimes in Khartoum, in order to maintain their power over the Southern Sudanese peoples. SPLA-Nasir accused Garang of ruling by force, in a \\"dictatorial reign of terror\\"; but ethnic rivalry seemed to have a part, with the Nasir faction mainly composed of Nuer, and Garang's supporters mainly Dinka people. Months of fighting between the two factions left thousands dead in early 1992. The SPLA-Nasir also raised the idea of an independent south (whereas Garang wanted unity). On 14 September 1992, Bany, who was at the time Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the SPLA and Deputy Chairman of the SPLM, announced his defection from the SPLA, and escaped Garang territory. The following day, Commander Salva Kiir Mayardit was promoted from Chief of Staff to Bany's old positions of Deputy Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Chairman. Bany joined forces with Machar and Akol, and later joined forces with Bol to form SPLA-United, Sudanese People's Liberation Army-United. Garang in a crowd of supporters Garang had refused to participate in the 1985 interim government or the 1986 elections, remaining a rebel leader. However, the SPLA and government signed a peace agreement on January 9, 2005, in Nairobi, in Kenya. On July 9, 2005, he was sworn in as the First-Vice-President - the second most powerful person in the country - following a ceremony in which he and President Omar al-Bashir signed a power-sharing constitution. Simultaneously, he became the premier in southern Sudan. This administration had limited autonomy for six years, at the end of which there would be a scheduled referendum regarding secession. No Christian or southerner had ever held such a high government post. Commenting after this ceremony, Garang stated, \\"I congratulate the Sudanese people, this is not my peace or the peace of al-Bashir, it is the peace of the Sudanese people.\\" In the Hillcrest Hotel in Nairobi on New Year's Day 2003, there was a meeting between the SPLA and the Fur people. Garang asked two associates of Abdul Wahid al Nur (who later formed the Sudan Liberation Movement) to declare that the Fur people were with the SPLA ‚Äì they refused. Over 15 months, starting in September 2003, Ali Osman and Garang met in private in Naivasha. Their secret meetings and negotiations lasted up until the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) was initialed on New Year's Eve 2004. The CPA appeared to embody the vision of the \\"New Sudan\\" that Garang wanted. Within the CPA, power was split between the National Congress Party and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement for six years, until 2010, with Garang as the first vice-president. As a leader, John Garang's democratic credentials were often questioned. For example, according to Gill Lusk, \\"John Garang did not tolerate dissent and anyone who disagreed with him was either imprisoned or killed\\". Under his leadership, the SPLA was accused of human rights abuses. The ideological profile of SPLA was as shadowy as Garang himself. He varied from Marxism to drawing support from Christian fundamentalists in the US. The United States State Department argued that Garang's presence in the government would have helped solve the Darfur conflict in western Sudan, but others consider these claims \\"excessively optimistic\\". U.S. President George W. Bush, who supported South Sudanese independence, especially considered Garang to be a promising leader and called him a \\"partner in peace.\\" Bush highlighted Garang's Christian faith, and even connected him to support at evangelical churches in his hometown of Midland, Texas. Death In late July 2005, Garang died after the Ugandan presidential Mi-172 helicopter he was flying in crashed. He had been returning from a meeting in Rwakitura with long-time ally President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda. He did not tell the Sudanese government that he was going to this meeting and therefore did not take the presidential plane. In fact, Garang had said he was going to spend the weekend in New Cush, a small village near the Kenyan borders founded by Garang himself. To this day neither the identity of any other participants at the meeting nor its purpose, are known. After the helicopter had been missing for more than 24 hours, the Ugandan president notified the Sudanese government, which in turn contacted the SPLM for information. The SPLM responded that the helicopter Garang was taking had landed safely on an old SPLA training camp. The Sudanese state television duly reported this. A few hours later, Abdel Basset Sabdarat, Sudan's Information Minister, then appeared on TV to refute the earlier report that Garang's helicopter landed safely. It was, in fact, Yasir Arman, the SPLA/M spokesperson, who had told the government that Garang's plane had landed safely and his intention, in doing so, was to buy time for internal succession arrangements within the SPLA, before Garang's death was to be declared. Garang's helicopter crashed on Friday and he remained 'missing' throughout Saturday. During this time, the government believed he was still resolving his affairs in Southern Sudan. Finally, a statement released by the office of the Sudanese President, Omar el-Bashir, confirmed that the Ugandan presidential helicopter had crashed into \\"a mountain range in southern Sudan because of poor visibility and this resulted in the death of Dr. John Garang DeMabior, six of his colleagues and seven Ugandan crew members.\\" According to the Sudan Tribune John Garang's legacy was a major cornerstone in South Sudan's fight for independence. Without Garang, many marginalized people of Africa, including that of Sudan would still be largely forgotten about in the modern world. Grave of John Garang in Juba, South Sudan - guarded by SPLA- soldiers His body was flown to New Cush, a southern Sudanese settlement near the scene of the crash, where former rebel fighters and civilian supporters gathered to pay their respects to Garang. Garang's funeral took place on August 3 in Juba. His widow, Rebecca Nyandeng De Mabior, promised to continue his work stating: In our culture we say \\"if you kill the lion, you see what the lioness will do\\". =Rumors= Both the Sudanese government and the head of the SPLA blamed the weather for the accident. There are, however, doubts as to whether this was the true cause, especially among the rank and file of the SPLA. Yoweri Museveni, the Ugandan President, stated that the possibility of \\"external factors\\" having played a role could not be eliminated. The SPLM/SPLA Rumbek crisis, which took place in Rumbek from November 29 to December 1, 2004; one month before the signing of the CPA is also believed to have been a factor relevant to John Garang's death. While the Sudanese people followed the Naivasha peace talks closely, with high hopes of freedom and democratic transformation, the Sudan People‚Äôs Liberation Movement (SPLM) was rife with rumors and accusations of conspiracy relating to the removal of SPLM deputy Chairman, Salva Kiir Mayardit, and his replacement with the young Nhial Deng Nhial. Nhial Deng Nhial was the son of the famous leader of the southern Sudanese, William Deng Nhial, who had been assassinated by the Sudanese army in 1968. William Deng Nhial had led the Sudan African National Union (SANU) in exile, but had returned to Sudan to take part in the 1968 elections, shortly before he was killed. It has been reported that Salva Kiir disagreed with the amnesty afforded to Riek Machar and Lam Akol after their coup attempt against Garang in 2003; he also disliked Garang's decision to give Machar a leadership position as his deputy. It is rumored that in response to these actions by Garang, Kiir threatened to lead an armed revolt against South Sudan's leadership.

The declaration rejected the Massachusetts Government Act and resolved on a boycott of imported goods from Britain unless the Intolerable Acts were repealed. The Resolves were recognized by statesman Edmund Burke as a major development in colonial animosity leading to adoption of the United States Declaration of Independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1776, and he urged British conciliation with the American colonies, to little effect. The First Continental Congress endorsed the Resolves on September 17, 1774. History On August 26‚Äì27, the Committees of Correspondence from Suffolk, Middlesex, Essex, and Worcester counties met at Faneuil Hall in Boston to oppose the recent Massachusetts Government Act, which had disenfranchised citizens of Massachusetts by revoking key provisions of the provincial Charter of 1691. The convention urged all Massachusetts counties to close their courts, rather than to submit to the oppressive measure. Berkshire had already done so, and by the first week of October, seven of the nine contiguous mainland counties in Massachusetts had followed suit. As each county in turn closed its court, it issued a set of resolves to explain its actions.William Lincoln, ed., Journals of Each Provincial Congress in Massachusetts in 1774 and 1775... Containing the Proceedings of the County Conventions (Boston: Dutton and Wentworth, 1838). Although the resolves were all similar in tone and scope, the one written by patriots in Suffolk has received more attention for two reasons: it was better crafted, and it was formally endorsed by the Continental Congress. Suffolk, which contained Boston, was the only county in which courts remained nominally open, under the protection of British troops.Ray Raphael, The First American Revolution: Before Lexington and Concord (New York: The New Press, 2002), 82-156. At the Suffolk County Convention of the Committees of Correspondence on September 6, 1774, Joseph Warren introduced the first draft of the Suffolk Resolves, which were edited and approved three days later at the Daniel Vose House in Milton, Massachusetts, which was then part of Suffolk County but is now in Norfolk County, Massachusetts. The convention that adopted them had first met at the Woodward Tavern in Dedham, which is now the site of the Norfolk County Courthouse. As with the other counties' resolves, the Suffolk document denounced the Intolerable Acts, or Coercive Acts, which had recently been passed by the British Parliament and specifically resolved the following: # boycott British imports, curtail exports, and refuse to use British products; # pay \\"no obedience\\" to the Massachusetts Government Act or the Boston Port Bill; # demand resignations from those appointed to positions under the Massachusetts Government Act; # refuse payment of taxes until the Massachusetts Government Act was repealed; # support a colonial government in Massachusetts free of royal authority until the Intolerable Acts were repealed; # urge the colonies to raise militia of their own people. In one of his less famous rides, Paul Revere delivered a copy of the Resolves to the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where it was endorsed on September 17 as a show of colonial solidarity. In response, John Adams commented in his diary: \\"This was one of the happiest days of my life. In Congress we had generous, noble sentiments, and manly eloquence. This day convinced me that America will support Massachusetts or perish with her.\\"John Adams, Diary and Autobiography, L. H. Butterfield, ed., (Cambridge: Belknap Press, 1961), 2:134-135. Endorsement of the Suffolk Resolves and, with it the rebellion that had enveloped Massachusetts, altered the political balance in Congress and paved the way for radical measures, such as the Continental Association, a general nonimportation agreement. Previously, nonimportation agreements had been limited to specific localities, but this one applied throughout the rebellious colonies. The Committees of Inspection (also called the Committees of Safety), which were formed to enforce the Continental Association, established a revolutionary infrastructure, similar to that of the Sons of Liberty during the early days of the resistance. A number of counties in other colonies adopted declarations of grievances against Britain before the Declaration of Independence, including the Mecklenburg Resolves and the Tryon Resolves in 1775 and at least 90 other documents favoring independence in the spring of 1776,Pauline Maier, American Scripture: Making the Declaration of Independence (New York: Knopf, 1997). but the resolves from the Massachusetts County Conventions in August‚ÄìOctober 1774 were the first to promote across-the-board noncompliance with British governmental authority. Commemoration A historic plaque on Adams Street in the Lower Mills area of Milton commemorates the original site of the Daniel Vose House, where the Suffolk Resolves were signed on September 4, 1774. In order to prevent its demolition, the house was moved in 1950 from Lower Mills to 1370 Canton Avenue in Milton. Now known as the Suffolk Resolves House, it was restored to its original colonial appearance and is the headquarters of the Milton Historical Society. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and is open to public view.

Greening Australia was formed by the United Nations Association of Australia and the Nursery Industry Association of Australia. In the 1980s tree cover decline was acknowledged as having a serious adverse impact on agricultural and pastoral productivity. Removal of tree cover was also linked with the development of salinity, soil degradation and erosion, and declining water quality. On World Environment Day in 1982, then Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser announced the establishment of the National Tree Program, which aimed to reverse tree decline throughout Australia. Greening Australia provided the non-government arm of the National Tree Program. With representation in every state and territory and a national office in Canberra, Greening Australia became the primary focus for non- government tree projects. Since its inception, Greening Australia has undergone a natural evolution over the years ‚Äì from a tree planting-centric organisation to a landscape-focused one. The Gondwana Link and River Recovery projects reflect this change and the need to address the impacts of climate change. Greening Australia has been involved in many large scale revegetation and restoration projects in Australia since its inception, including the National Tree Program, the One Billion Trees Project, Bushcare Support, National Corrdiors of Green, Florabank and Green Corps. The focus of its work lies in providing trees and tree planting services, technical advice and education, volunteer co-ordination and funding for restoration projects. On World Environment Day 1998, Greening Australia's work was recognised with admission to the United Nations Environment Programme Global 500 Roll of Honour. This award recognises outstanding achievements in protection of the environment, and represents a significant achievement for Australia's role in world conservation. Current projects Greening Australia's mission is to conserve and restore landscapes at scale through collaborative, science-based and innovative conservation programs. The organisation has set bold 2030 goals to align their five national programs with global restoration targets. These goals include:https://www.greeningaustralia.org.au/ * 500,000,000 native plants established * 330,000 hectares of habitat restored * 1,300,000 tonnes of carbon sequestered per annum Great Southern Landscapes Since European settlement, agricultural landscapes in southern Australia have lost over 80% of their natural habitat, impacting on threatened species and the productivity of Australia's farmlands. To help threatened plants and wildlife, and combat global climate change, Greening Australia are working across southern Australia‚Äôs unique landscapes, integrating large-scale re-afforestation and carbon sinks into farming systems to create healthy, productive landscapes for people and nature.https://www.greeningaustralia.org.au/programs/great- southern-landscapes/ Gondwana Link is one of the largest and most ambitious conservation projects in Australia's history. Designed to protect and restore land across and adjoining the nation's only global renowned biodiversity hotspot, the completed link will be an arc of bushland stretching for 1000 kilometres, from the wet forests in Western Australia's far southwest to the edge of the Nullarbor Plain. Greening Australia is working alongside a host of partners on this project, including Bush Heritage Australia and The Nature Conservancy. The Living Flinders program covers 1.3 million hectares of internationally significant landscape in the Southern Flinders Ranges in South Australia. It is a national hotspot for native plants and animals including the endangered Yellow-Footed Rock-wallaby and supports critically endangered Peppermint Box and Grey Box Grassy Woodlands. The project aims to increase conservation efforts on privately held land as well as reduce invasion by feral species and reconnect existing reserve systems. It is a ten-year project that calls for a $30m investment. Living Flinders is also part of the SA Government's Naturelinks program as well as an important component of the Trans Australia Eco-link. Reef Aid Climate change and poor water quality are the greatest threats to the future of the Great Barrier Reef. Greening Australia is addressing both through its Great Southern Landscapes and Reef Aid programs. Reef Aid works with landholders, communities and Traditional Owners to improve water quality for the Reef by rebuilding gullies and restoring coastal wetlands across the catchment.https://www.greeningaustralia.org.au/programs/reef-aid/ Nature in Cities As climate change and population growth intensify pressures on our urban areas, Greening Australia are working with communities, businesses and governments across Australia to create greener, more liveable cities and urban areas where both people and nature thrive. The program aims to bring nature back to our cities and urban fringes by restoring natural ecosystems and urban tree canopy cover for wildlife; improving water quality in our rivers and wetlands; building green corridors to help meet carbon neutral targets and creating open spaces for recreation.https://www.greeningaustralia.org.au/programs/nature-in-cities/ Tasmania Island Ark Tasmania is Australia‚Äôs last refuge for some of Australia's most critically endangered animals ‚Äì species that are now virtually extinct on the mainland including the Tasmanian Devil, Eastern Bettong, Eastern Quoll and Eastern Barred Bandicoot. Together with landholders, Tasmania Island Ark is working to recreate 15,000 ha of habitat across the Tasmanian midlands to create a stronghold for endangered wildlife and reconnect people and nature, while revitalising local farming communities.https://www.greeningaustralia.org.au/programs/tasmania-island-ark/ Thriving on country Traditional knowledge plays an essential role in conservation and in managing country. Thriving on Country is Greening Australia's organisation-wide commitment to a stronger, reconciled Australia. The organisation partners with Indigenous communities across Australia to bring together traditional and contemporary knowledge, exchange skills, increase employment opportunities and support people to live and work on country.https://www.greeningaustralia.org.au/programs/thriving-on-country/ Past Projects Saltshaker The Saltshaker Project was an initiative of Greening Australia, SE NSW, the Boorowa Regional Catchment Committee, and Boorowa Council, in association with the Boorowa Landcare Network, to tackle dryland salinity, reduced water quality, and biodiversity in Boorowa, New South Wales. It was funded by the Natural Heritage Trust, and involved nearly 70 landowners. Bushfire Crisis On 13 January 2020, the Australian Government announced an initial $50m investment in an emergency response to the devastating Australian bushfires for wildlife and habitat recovery. $5 million of this initial investment will see Greening Australia lead the development of a strategic program to build and secure native seed and plant supply for landscape restoration, recovery and resilience in bushfire impacted areas and other vulnerable landscapes. https://www.greeningaustralia.org.au/greening-australia-to-lead-5m-native- seed-and-restoration-program-as-part-of-bushfire-recovery/  Publications  Greening Australia has published numerous books on native Australian vegetation, including several authored by South Australian ethnobotanist, Neville Bonney.

Although one of the four major proponents of Epicureanism, only fragments of his works remain. A Metrodorus bust was found in Velia, slightly different modeled to depict Parmenides. Life Metrodorus was a native of Lampsacus on the Hellespont. His father's name was Athenaeus or Timocrates, his mother's Sande.; see also Strabo, xiii. and Cicero, Tusculanae Quaestiones, v. 37. Together with his brother Timocrates of Lampsacus he joined the school Epicurus had set up in their home town. Timocrates, however, soon fell out with both his brother and Epicurus and devoted the rest of his life to spreading malicious slander about them. Metrodorus on the other hand soon became the most distinguished of the disciples of Epicurus, with whom he lived on terms of the closest friendship, and whom he later followed to Athens, never having left him since he became acquainted with him, except for six months on one occasion, when he paid a visit to his home. Metrodorus died in 278/7 BC, in the 53rd year of his age, seven years before Epicurus, who would have appointed him his successor had he survived him. He left behind him a son named Epicurus, and a daughter, whom Epicurus, in his will, entrusted to the guardianship of Amynomachus and Timocrates of Potamus, to be brought up under the joint care of themselves and Hermarchus, and provided for out of the property which he left behind him. In a letter also which he wrote upon his death-bed, Epicurus commended the children to the care of Idomeneus, who had married Batis, the sister of Metrodorus. The 20th of each month was kept by the disciples of Epicurus as a festive day in honour of their master and Metrodorus. Leontion is spoken of as the wife or mistress of Metrodorus. Diogenes La√´rtius mentioned Epicurus letter, \\"All my books to be given to Hermarchus. And if anything should happen to Hermarchus before the children of Metrodorus grow up, Amynomachus and Timocrates shall give from the funds bequeathed by me, so far as possible, enough for their several needs, as long as they are well ordered. And let them provide for the rest according to my arrangements; that everything may be carried out, so far as it lies in their power. Of my slaves I manumit Mys, Nicias, Lycon, and I also give Phaedrium her liberty.\\" Philosophy Roman copy of a Greek portrait bust of Metrodorus. (Pergamon museum, Berlin) The philosophy of Metrodorus appears to have been of a more sensual kind than that of Epicurus.Cicero, De Natura Deorum, i. 40, Tusculanae Quaestiones, v. 9, de Finibus, ii. 28. ¬ß 92, 30. ¬ß 99, 31. ¬ß 101. Perfect happiness, according to Cicero's account, he made to consist in having a well-constituted body, and knowing that it would always remain so. He found fault with his brother for not admitting that the belly was the test and measure of every thing that pertained to a happy life.Cicero, De Natura Deorum, i. 40; Athenaeus, vii. 279 F; Plutarch, Non posse suaviter vivi secundum Epicurum, 1098; Adversus Colotem, 1108, 1125. According to Seneca, Epicurus placed Metrodorus among those who acquire assistance in working their way towards truth.Seneca, Epistulae Morales, lii. 3 Diogenes La√´rtius lists the following works by Metrodorus: * Œ†œÅ·Ω∏œÇ œÑŒø·Ω∫œÇ ·º∞Œ±œÑœÅŒøœçœÇ, œÑœÅŒØŒ± ‚Äì Against the Physicians (3 volumes) * Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ Œ±·º∞œÉŒ∏ŒÆœÉŒµœâŒΩ ‚Äì On Sensations * Œ†œÅ·Ω∏œÇ Œ§ŒπŒºŒøŒ∫œÅŒ¨œÑŒ∑ŒΩ ‚Äì Against Timocrates * Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ ŒºŒµŒ≥Œ±ŒªŒøœàœÖœáŒØŒ±œÇ ‚Äì On Magnanimity * Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÑ·øÜœÇ ·ºòœÄŒπŒ∫ŒøœçœÅŒøœÖ ·ºÄœÅœÅœâœÉœÑŒØŒ±œÇ ‚Äì On Epicurus's Weak Health * Œ†œÅ·Ω∏œÇ œÑŒø·Ω∫œÇ Œ¥ŒπŒ±ŒªŒµŒ∫œÑŒπŒ∫ŒøœçœÇ ‚Äì Against the Dialecticians * Œ†œÅ·Ω∏œÇ œÑŒø·Ω∫œÇ œÉŒøœÜŒπœÉœÑŒ¨œÇ, ·ºêŒΩŒΩŒ≠Œ± ‚Äì Against the Sophists (9 volumes) * Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÑ·øÜœÇ ·ºêœÄ·Ω∂ œÉŒøœÜŒØŒ±ŒΩ œÄŒøœÅŒµŒØŒ±œÇ ‚Äì On the Way to Wisdom * Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÑ·øÜœÇ ŒºŒµœÑŒ±Œ≤ŒøŒª·øÜœÇ ‚Äì On Change * Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÄŒªŒøœçœÑŒøœÖ ‚Äì On Wealth * Œ†œÅ·Ω∏œÇ ŒîŒ∑ŒºœåŒ∫œÅŒπœÑŒøŒΩ ‚Äì Against Democritus * Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ Œµ·ΩêŒ≥ŒµŒΩŒµŒØŒ±œÇ ‚Äì On Noble Birth Metrodorus also wrote Against the Euthyphro,Philodemus, On Piety, col. 25, 702-5, col 34, 959-60, Obbink and Against the Gorgiasin two books, Philodemus, PHerc. 1005, col XI, 14-15, Angeli of Plato.

Notes on a Scandal in the U.S.) is a 2003 novel by Zo√´ Heller. It is about a female teacher at a London comprehensive school who begins an affair with an underage pupil. The novel was shortlisted for the 2003 Man Booker Prize. The Guardian ranked What Was She Thinking? Notes on a Scandal #70 in their list of 100 Best Books of the 21st Century. A film version was released in 2006, starring Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett. The film received four Academy Award nominations, including nominations for Dench and Blanchett. Heller stated to The Observer in 2003 that the real life controversy of American middle-school teacher Mary Kay LeTourneau's affair with a student was the inspiration for the novel. Plot summary Barbara, a veteran history teacher at a comprehensive school in London, is a lonely, unmarried woman in her early sixties, and she is eager to find a close friend. However, she reveals that she has been unable to make a previous friendship last as she was considered by previous friends to be domineering and demanding. Her former friend, teacher Jennifer Dodd, even threatened her with an injunction if she tried contacting her again. When Bathsheba \\"Sheba\\" Hart is hired as an art teacher, Barbara immediately feels that they might become close friends. When Sheba invites Barbara for Sunday lunch with her family, she is ecstatic and gives the lunch date enormous significance. Initially unknown to Barbara, Sheba falls in love with a 15-year-old pupil, Steven Connolly, who is from a deprived background and has literacy problems. Although they frequently have sex in risky places, including at school and in the open on Hampstead Heath, the unlikely couple successfully conceal their affair from colleagues and family. During Barbara's first visit to Sheba's residence, she tells Barbara a highly expurgated version of what has happened between her and Connolly, claiming only that he has tried to kiss her and that she discouraged his advances. Barbara offers her some advice on how to cool the boy's ardour, and considers the matter closed. Sheba confesses to Barbara that despite her apparently charmed life, she feels unfulfilled. Sheba has a difficult relationship with her rebellious seventeen-year-old daughter, Polly, whose youth and beauty only intensify her mother's own feelings of aging and waste. Sheba's husband, Richard, is significantly older than she is, and their relationship sometimes has a father-daughter element to it. Sheba's complaints trouble Barbara, who had considered Sheba to have the perfect family life. Barbara eventually finds out about the affair on Guy Fawkes Night, when she sees Sheba talking to Connolly on Primrose Hill. Barbara feels betrayed that Sheba did not confide in her properly about this during the early stages of their friendship, and is angered by Sheba's obsession with Connolly and her relative neglect of their friendship. When Barbara's cat Portia is diagnosed with colon cancer and needs to be euthanised, she seeks out Sheba for support, only for her to get a call from Connolly during their meeting. Sheba abandons a distraught Barbara in favour of Connolly, compounding Barbara's sense of betrayal from her. The power dynamics in the relationship between Connolly and Sheba are changing, with Connolly's interest in the affair waning as Sheba's grows. Sheba becomes needier and starts to write love letters to the boy. Sheba secretly visits Connolly in his parents' council house, and Connolly callously insults her when she tries to make conversation with him. Sheba still does not break off the affair, having become quite enslaved to the now barely invested Connolly. Brian Bangs, a mathematics teacher, asks Barbara to have Saturday lunch with him one day just before Christmas. He confesses his infatuation with Sheba, leading Barbara to realise that he only asked her out to use her as a means to discover information about Sheba's private life. Overcome by jealousy, Barbara alludes to Sheba's secret. (\\"'Sheba likes younger men, you know. Much younger men.' I paused a moment. 'I mean, you are aware of her unusually close relationship with one of the Year Eleven boys? '\\") Afterwards, Barbara is wracked with guilt, but cannot summon up the courage to tell Sheba what she has done. Rather, she hopes Bangs will not report what she has told him. Sheba's relationship with Polly deteriorates further when the girl's unruly behaviour results in her expulsion from her boarding school. On two occasions, Polly accuses Sheba of having an affair. Sheba is furious about the accusation, believing that she has covered her tracks successfully. Meanwhile, Sheba attempts to take comfort in Connolly throughout her troubles by calling him constantly, and when he fails to answer her calls, she shows up again at his house, only to find that Connolly has taken up with a younger girl and abandoned her. Even this new found evidence of Connolly's loss of interest in her is not enough for Sheba to cease her obsession of him, and she pines for him even knowing she will never hear from him again. The school's headmaster is somehow informed about the illicit affair ‚Äî it is implied that the culprit is Bangs. Sheba is suspended from her job and charged with indecent assault on a pupil. Her husband demands that she leave the family home and prevents her from seeing their children, especially their son Ben, who has Down syndrome; Polly, meanwhile, refuses to have any contact with her. While Sheba's life is quickly disintegrating, Barbara thrives on the new situation, which she considers her chance to prove her qualities as a friend, even when the headmaster, glad to rid himself of one of his severest critics, forces her into early retirement. Barbara gives up the lease on her own small flat and moves with Sheba into temporary accommodation in Sheba's brother's house. Sheba finds Barbara's manuscript and discovers that she has been writing an account of her relationship with Connolly. She is distraught and furious, not least because Barbara has written about events she did not personally witness, and made judgements about people close to Sheba. She is eventually reconciled with Barbara due to their shared desperation and loneliness, as both have now lost everything. Even now, Barbara uses their desperate circumstances as yet another opportunity to further their relationship, and the mentally weakened Sheba can do little to resist. The novel ends with Sheba, trapped and demoralised, resigning to Barbara's dominance of her.

Life He was the son of Athenodorus. His friendship with Epicurus started after the latter's escape from Mytilene in 307 or 306 BC when he opened a philosophical school at Lampsacus associating himself with other citizens of the town, like Pythocles, Colotes, and Idomeneus.

A man of mild and friendly manners, as Philodemus refers, he adopted fully the philosophical system of his friend, and, although he had previously acquired great reputation as a mathematician, he now maintained with Epicurus the worthlessness of geometry.Cicero, De finibus, i. 6 ; Academica, ii. 33Diogenes Laertius, Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, ii.105, x. 12 But the statement may be at least doubted, since it is certain Polyaenus wrote a mathematical work called Puzzles () in which the validity of geometry is maintained. It was against this treatise that another Epicurean, Demetrius Lacon, wrote Unsolved questions of Polyaenus () in the 2nd century BC. Like Epicurus, a considerable number of spurious works seem to have been assigned to him; one of these was Against the Orators, whose authenticity was attacked both by Zeno of Sidon and his pupil Philodemus. Writings The works attributed to Polyaenus include:Donald J.

He writes under the name Pepetela. A Portuguese Angolan, Pepetela was born in Benguela, Portuguese Angola, and fought as a member of the MPLA in the long guerrilla war for Angola's independence. Much of his writing deals with Angola's political history in the 20th century. Mayombe, for example, is a novel that portrays the lives of a group of MPLA guerrillas who are involved in the anti-colonial struggle in Cabinda, Yaka follows the lives of members of a white settler family in the coastal town of Benguela, and A Gera√ß√£o da Utopia reveals the disillusionment of young Angolans during the post-independence period. Pepetela has also written about Angola's earlier history in A Gloriosa Fam√≠lia and Lueji, and has expanded into satire with his series of Jaime Bunda novels. His most recent works include Predadores, a scathing critique of Angola's ruling classes, O Quase Fim do Mundo, a post-apocalyptic allegory, and O Planalto e a Estepe, a look at Angola's history and connections with other former communist nations. Pepetela won the Cam√µes Prize, the world's highest honour for Lusophone literature, in 1997. \\"Pepetela\\" is a Kimbundu word that means \\"eyelash,\\" which is a translation of his Portuguese surname, \\"Pestana\\". The author received this nom de guerre during his time as an MPLA combatant. Early life Pepetela was born in Benguela, Portuguese Angola, to Portuguese Angolan parents. His mother's family had been an influential commercial and military family in the Mo√ß√¢medes (present-day Namibe) region of Angola, his great grandfather having been a major in the Portuguese Army. His mother's family had been in Angola for five generations, whereas his father was born in Angola to Portuguese parents and spent much of his childhood in mainland Portugal.Laban, Michel. Angola: Encontro com escritores. Lisbon: Fund. Eng. Ant√≥nio de Almeida, 1991. pp. 784-785, Pepetela had a middle-class upbringing in Benguela, attending a school where students of all races and classes intermingled. He has claimed that being raised in Benguela gave him more opportunities to befriend people of other races, because Benguela was a much more mixed city than many others in Angola were during the colonial era. He also claims that he began to develop a class consciousness during his school days, noticing the differences between his own lifestyle and the lives of friends who lived in a nearby slum area. In an interview with Michel Laban, he claims that his upbringing also influenced his political views. He had an uncle who was a journalist and writer and who exposed him to many important leftist thinkers. His father also had a considerable library that allowed the young Pepetela to learn more about the French Revolution, something that influenced him profoundly.Laban, Angola, pp. 778-780. When he was 14, the young Pepetela moved to Lubango (then S√° da Bandeira), to continue his studies because there was no high school in Benguela at the time. In Lubango, Pepetela claimed that he became more aware of the problems of race in Angola, as Lubango was a much more segregated community than Benguela. In Lubango he was influenced by a leftist priest, Padre Noronha, who taught him about the Cuban Revolution and kept him abreast of current events.Laban, Angola, pp. 781-782. Upon finishing his schooling in Lubango, Pepetela travelled to Portugal where he began to study engineering. While at the Instituto Superior T√©cnico in Lisbon he befriended other Angolan students who were associated with the Casa dos Estudantes do Imp√©rio, the student association of Portuguese students from the overseas. After two years of study he decided that engineering would not fulfill his interests, and he tried to enter the History course at the Faculty of Letters of the University of Lisbon. However, with the start of the Portuguese Colonial War home in Angola, he was summoned to serve in the Portuguese Armed Forces and decided to flee Portugal.Laban, Angola, pp. 785-786. Frontline experience, early novels, and plays Pepetela first went to Paris and then, in 1963, earned a scholarship to study Sociology in Algiers, where he was approached by Henrique Abranches from the MPLA to help create a Center for Angolan Studies. This Center became the focus of the young Pepetela's work for the next decade. Until 1969, Pepetela, Abranches, and other MPLA members worked together to document Angolan culture and society and publicize the MPLA's struggle. In 1969, the Center moved from Algiers to Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo. After the move to Brazzaville, Pepetela became more active in the MPLA's armed resistance against the Portuguese in the Cabinda region of Angola and on the Eastern Front.Laban, Angola, pp. 789-790. This time in the late 1960s and early 1970s served as the inspiration for one of Pepetela's most recognized works, the war narrative, Mayombe. During this time, Pepetela also wrote his first novel, Muana Pu√≥. The novel was written during his time in Algiers and deals with Angolan culture, using the metaphor of traditional masks of the Chokwe people to expose different dichotomies present in Angolan culture. His novel displays the knowledge of indigenous Angolan cultures that Pepetela gained during his time on the Eastern Front of the war for independence. Muana Pu√≥ was never intended to be published, a detail Pepetela made clear in an interview with Michel Laban. The author had written the novel as an exercise for himself and several of his close friends to read; nevertheless, the novel was published in 1978, during Pepetela's tenure in the Angolan government.Laban, Angola, p. 774. In 1972, Pepetela released his first published novel. This work was As Aventuras de Ngunga, a novel that he intended for a small student audience.Laban, Angola, p. 773. In this text, Pepetela explores the growth of Ngunga, a young MPLA guerrilla, using an epic and didactic tone. The novel introduces the reader, through the eyes of Ngunga, to the customs, geography, and psychology of Angola. Pepetela also used this work to create a dialogue between Angolan tradition and his revolutionary ideology, exploring which traditions should be nurtured, and which should be altered.Campos, Maria do Carmo Sep√∫lveda, \\"As Aventuras de Ngunga nas trilhas da liberta√ß√£o\\". As aventuras...is a novel that exemplifies Pepetela's early career, exhibiting a deep love for Angola, a desire to explore Angola's history and culture, a revolutionary spirit, and a didactic tone. The novel was written and published while Pepetela was fighting the colonial government on the Eastern Front in Angola. By contrast, Muana Pu√≥ and Mayombe were also written while he was serving on the front, but were not published until after Angolan independence. When Angola gained independence in 1975, Pepetela became the Vice Minister of Education in President Agostinho Neto's government. The author was a part of the government for seven years, submitting his resignation in 1982 to dedicate more time to his writing.Laban, Angola, p. 798. During his tenure as Vice Minister he published several novels, including Mayombe, a novel that had been written when he was an active MPLA combatant in the early 1970s, the publication of which only came about with the explicit support of President Agostinho Neto.Leite, Ana Mafalda. \\"Angola\\" The Post-Colonial Literature of Lusophone Africa. Patrick Chabal (ed.), Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 1996. During this period, Pepetela diversified his writing, also writing two plays that focused on Angolan history and on revolutionary politics. Pepetela was part of the governing board of the Angolan Writers' Union throughout this period as well. Pepetela's plays written during his government tenure also reflect the themes in As Aventuras de Ngunga. The first of the plays, A Corda, was the first full-length dramatic work to be published in post-independence Angola. It is a play that, in the words of Ana Mafalda Leite, is \\"didactic and more than a little ideological, making it of limited literary interest\\".Leite, Post- Colonial Literature, p. 141. The play is in one act and features two sides playing a game of tug-of-war over Angola. One side includes the Americans and their Angolan clients, while the other side consists of five guerilla fighters of various ethnicities representing the MPLA. The next play that Pepetela wrote, A Revolta da Casa dos √çdolos, takes place in the past, drawing parallels between the Kongo kingdom in the 16th century and Angola's struggle for independence. Leite writes, \\"The play remains didactic but it is innovative both in terms of its use of historical material, and especially in the complexities of the actual mise en sc√®ne\\".Leite, Post-Colonial Literature, p. 142. Exit from the government, work published in the 1980s As mentioned above, Pepetela published several novels during his time as a government minister. Of these Mayombe is among the best known. The novel is an account of Pepetela's time as a guerilla in the MPLA. The novel functions on two levels, one in which the characters' thoughts about the nature of the struggle for independence are explored, and another that narrates the \\"action and incidents\\" experienced by the nationalist fighters. Ana Mafalda Leite considers the novel to be both critical and heroic, both attempting to highlight the ethnic diversity supposedly celebrated by the MPLA and also illustrating the tribal divisions present in Angolan society, which would lead to the eventual civil war that tore the nation apart in the years from independence until 2002. Leite writes that \\"the theme of war assumes an heroic and epic dimension since it is a conflict which defines the foundation of the 'fatherland'\\".Leite, Post-Colonial Literature, pp.118-119. After leaving the government at the end of 1982, Pepetela began to focus exclusively on his writing, beginning work on his most ambitious novel to date, Yaka. Yaka, first published in 1984, is a sweeping historical novel that examines the lives of a family of Portuguese settlers who came to Benguela in the 19th century. A clear desire to research his own origins can be seen in Pepetela's choice to write Yaka. Pepetela himself, as mentioned earlier in this entry, is a descendant of Portuguese settlers in Benguela. Like Muana Pu√≥, Yaka also incorporates traditional Angolan spiritual objects in its narrative technique. Where the first novel focuses on masks, Yaka uses a traditional wooden statue utilized by the yakas, social organizations dedicated to the prosecution of war, to structure the narrative. Ana Mafalda Leite writes, \\"Yaka symbolises at once the consciousness of traditional values and 'the anticipated spirit of nationality' of the new country\\".Leite, Post-Colonial Literature, p. 116. Yaka won the 1986 Angolan national prize for literature. Pepetela continued to write throughout the decade, publishing O c√£o e os Caluandas, a novel that looks at the inhabitants of Luanda and the changes that they have undergone since independence, one year after the publication of Yaka. The novel is notable for using the story of a German shepherd's wanderings through Luanda to structure it, and for containing a variety of narrative voices.Martins, Renata, \\"Pepetela: O c√£o e os caluandas\\" , August 2006. Nova Cultura. November 21, 2009. In 1989, he published Lueji, a work similar to A Revolta na Casa dos √çdolos in that it draws parallels between Angolan history and the contemporary situation in the country. The novel juxtaposes the princess Lueji, an important figure in 17th-century Angolan history, with a young ballerina who is dancing the role of Lueji in a contemporary piece. In the words of Ana Mafalda Leite, \\"The author writes chronologically of the two women, whose lives eventually begin to merge in the novel.\\"Leite, Post-Colonial Literature, p. 112. In the novel, Pepetela recreates the history of seventeenth century Angola. This is a project that he would undertake again with the 16th century in his 1994 novel A gloriosa fam√≠lia. New literary directions and the Pr√©mio Cam√µes In the 1990s, Pepetela's writing continued to exhibit interest in Angola's history, but also began to examine the political situation in the country with a greater sense of irony and criticism. His first novel of the decade, the 1992 A gera√ß√£o da utopia, addresses many of the issues first raised in Mayombe, but from the perspective of the post-independence reality of Angola. The Angolan Civil War and intense corruption in the government both led to a questioning of the revolutionary values espoused in the earlier novel. Ana Mafalda Leite describes the novel as \\"a critical and sceptical book, not to say a book of disillusionment, certainly one far removed from Mayombe'sheroic virtues.\\"Leite, Post-Colonial Literature p. 119 In this novel, Pepetela analyzes his characters psychologically in greater depth than he had done in his earlier works and assumes a very critical stance. The novel, spanning three decades, is divided into four parts, each of which covers an important aspect of Angola's 20th century, including Portuguese colonial oppression, the war for independence, the civil war, and the brief respite from the war that occurred in the early 1990s. Pepetela's interest in history remained evident in this book, but his criticism of the Angolan establishment was something new that would reappear again and again. His next novel of the decade, O Desejo de Kianda, published in 1995, continues to manifest the disillusionment exhibited in A Gera√ß√£o da Utopia. The novel takes more of a magical realist approach than any of Pepetela's former works, positing a situation where several of Luanda's largest buildings collapse into Kinaxixi square with all the inhabitants left unharmed. The heroine, a character named Carmina Cara de Cu, leaves her career as a government bureaucrat and becomes an arms dealer.Cusack, \\"Pepetela\\", Historical Companion to Postcolonial Literatures: Continental Europe and Its Empires. Prem Poddar, Rajeev S. Patke and Lars Jensen (eds). Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2008, p. 486. In an essay on the novel comparing the collapse of the buildings that is the focal point of the novel to the attacks of September 11, 2001, Phillip Rothwell writes that the novel \\"in some ways continues Pepetela's profound and damning portrayal of a betrayed utopia\\".Rothwell, Phillip. \\"Rereading Pepetela's O Desejo de Kianda After 11 September 2001: Signs and Distractions.\\" Portuguese Studies, 20 (2004), pp. 195-207. The next year he published a different sort of novel, A Gloriosa Fam√≠lia. This work examines the story of the Van D√∫nem family, a prominent Angolan family of Dutch descent. Pepetela spent years researching the story of the Dutch in Angola in order to write the novel. This novel does not display the same cynical and disillusioned tone as his other novels of the decade did, instead being a broad historical narrative that does incorporate a somewhat magical realist tone. While this novel stands quite apart from much of the author's other work, the fascination with Angolan history prominent throughout his career probably comes to its truest fruition in this work. As the situation in Angola in the 1990s grew more and more dangerous, Pepetela began spending more time in Lisbon and Brazil. By this point in his life his writing had brought him renown throughout the Portuguese-speaking world. In 1997 he was awarded the Cam√µes Prize, the world's highest honour for Lusophone literature. Pepetela is the first Angolan and the second African author to win this prestigious award. Satire and foreign horizons in the new millennium Pepetela has continued to be a prolific writer throughout the 2000s. His work has taken a satirical turn with the series of \\"Jaime Bunda\\" novels, detective novels that cast a satirical view on life in Luanda in the new decade. Stephen Henighan writes that the character of Jaime Bunda, a bumbling detective with roots in two of Angola's most prominent families, represents the changes that the Luanda Creole population has undergone in the view of Pepetela. Rather than representing a revolutionary vanguard that will create a new Angolan identity, the Creoles of Luanda are depicted in the novels as a kleptocratic oligarchy.Henighan, Stephen. \\"'Um James Bond Subdesenvolvido': The Ideological Work of the Angolan Detective in Pepetela's 'Jaime Bunda' Novels.\\" Portuguese Studies, 22:1 (2006), pp. 135-152. Jaime Bunda is a parody of James Bond, whose name stems from his oversized backside (\\"bunda\\" in Portuguese). The character is obsessed with both James Bond films and American private-eye novels, something that Henighan claims is \\"ideologically charged\\" and illustrates elements of Angola's underdevelopment.Henighan, \\"Um James Bond...\\", p. 141. In the first of the novels, Jaime Bunda, agente secreto, published in 2001, the protagonist investigates a murder and rape that eventually leads him to a South African counterfeiter named Karl Botha, a reference to former South African prime minister P.W. Botha, who had mandated the South African intervention in Angola in the 1970s and 1980s.Henighan, \\"Um James Bond...\\", p. 143. The second novel, Jaime Bunda e a Morte do Americano, published in 2003, is set in Benguela instead of Luanda, and deals with American influence in Angola, as Jaime Bunda investigates the murder of an American and tries to seduce an American FBI agent. This novel also presents Pepetela's critique of U.S. foreign policy, as the heavy-handed behavior of the Angolan police mirrors the ways that Americans dealt with suspected terrorists during the same period.Bartlett, Richard, \\"Arse of a Detective\\" , 2009. African Review of Books. November 21, 2009. The novels were published by the Portuguese publisher Dom Quixote and were extremely popular in Portugal, having also had some success in other European countries, such as Germany, where Pepetela had been relatively unknown in the past.Henighan, \\"Um James Bond...\\", p. 144. Pepetela also published other types of novels during the decade. His first book to be published in the 2000s was A Montanha da √Ågua Lil√°s (2000), a children's book that also looks at the roots of social injustice. In 2005, after the success of the Jaime Bunda novels, he published Predadores, his sharpest critique of the Angolan ruling class yet. The novel takes place in post-independence Angola and follows the story of Vladimiro Caposso, a lowly bureaucrat who becomes a businessman. Igor Cusack describes the protagonist as a \\"murderous, philandering businessman gangster ... living in a sea of fellow sharks\\".Cusack, Igor. \\"Pepetela\\", p. 486. Though he began criticizing the nouveau riche class in Angola as far back as A gera√ß√£o da utopia, it can be seen through the Jaime Bunda novels and Predadores that by the 2000s this theme had become a dominant one in Pepetela's work. The final years of the 2000s have seen a continuation of Pepetela's prolific career, with novels appearing in 2007, 2008 and 2009. The 2007 novel O Terrorista de Berkeley, Calif√≥rnia is entirely set in the U.S. and has minimal connection to Angola. The book deals with current attitudes about terrorism and also with aspects of technology present in modern society. As with several of his earlier novels, Pepetela claimed in a recent interview with the Angolan Di√°rio de Not√≠cias that this novel was not intended to be published, but rather that he wrote it for himself.Di√°rio de Not√≠cias. \\"O quase fim do mundo do Pepetela\\" , 11 March 2008. Angola Digital: Arte e Cultura. 21 November 2009. His next novel, O Quase Fim do Mundo (2008), was also written as a personal exercise.Di√°rio de Not√≠cias It is a work that begins to touch on the realm of science fiction, portraying the challenges facing people who find that they are the last living beings left on earth. These characters, who have survived a global disaster, congregate on a small piece of land in Africa (that Pepetela stresses is very close to where humanity is thought to have originated) and are challenged with attempting to create some kind of new world. This book continues the trend begun with O Terrorista de Berkeley... in that it is not set in Angola, nor does it deal explicitly with the Angolan reality. The last novel of the 2000s, O Planalto e a Estepe, while it does deal with Angola, continues to reflect the internationalization of Pepetela's themes in the past decade. The book deals with a love affair between a white Angolan and a Mongolian whom he met while studying in Moscow. The novel also returns to some of Pepetela's earliest themes of discovering Angolan nature through its descriptions of the protagonist J√∫lio's childhood in Hu√≠la province. In addition to dedicating himself to his writing, Pepetela also taught. From 1982 until his retirement from teaching in 2008 he was a professor of sociology in the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Angola, now known as the University of Agostinho Neto. He was a visiting professor at Rutgers University in 2002 and the University of California Berkeley in 2003.

Overall, the season resulted in $751.6 million in damage, the most of any season at the time. The season officially began on June 15, and nine days later the first named storm developed. Hurricane Alice developed in the Gulf of Mexico and moved inland along the Rio Grande, producing significant precipitation and record flooding that killed 55 people. Activity was slow until late August; only Barbara, a minimal tropical storm, developed in July. In the span of two weeks, hurricanes Carol and Edna followed similar paths before both striking New England as major hurricanes. The latter became the costliest hurricane in Maine's history. In late September, Tropical Storm Gilda killed 29 people after drenching northern Honduras. A tropical depression in early October was captured by a high-altitude photograph on a rocket, thus producing the first large-scale image of a tropical cyclone. The strongest and deadliest hurricane of the season was Hurricane Hazel, which killed thousands in Haiti before striking near the North Carolina/South Carolina border in October. It caused heavy damage in the United States before becoming extratropical and affecting Ontario. Intense rainfall affected Toronto with severe flooding, leaving significant damage. The season officially ended on November 15, although another hurricane named Alice developed on December 30 to the northeast of the Lesser Antilles; it lasted until January 6 of the following year. In total, there were 16 tropical storms, 7 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes.

The agency, under the direction of Grady Norton had access to 43 other weather stations across the Atlantic basin. Norton died during the season from a stroke while tracking Hurricane Hazel. Additionally, a group of Hurricane Hunters planes were put on standby for the season, able to be flown out into storms and collect data. During the season, there were eight named storms, as well as an unnamed hurricane and a tropical depression. The season officially ended on November 15, although an unnamed tropical storm formed a day later. In addition, Tropical Storm Alice developed on December 31, the latest a tropical cyclone has developed in the calendar year. Cumulatively, tropical cyclones left 193 deaths and $756 million in damage, becoming the costliest hurricane season at the time. The season was one of six to have three major hurricanes strike the country, along with 2005 (which had four), 1893, 1909, 1933, and 2004. Two of the major hurricanes ‚Äì Carol and Edna ‚Äì struck New England; this occurred despite an average of only 5‚Äì10 New England hurricanes per century. Carol struck Connecticut as a hurricane and left widespread heavy damage. Only ten days later, Edna became the costliest hurricane in Maine's history. The third major hurricane, Hazel, was the strongest hurricane of the season, attaining winds of 150 mph (240 km/h). Unusually, no tropical cyclones affected Florida. The season's activity was reflected with a cumulative accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) rating of 113, which is categorized as being \\"above normal\\". ACE is, broadly speaking, a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as particularly strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots (39 mph, 63 km/h) or tropical storm strength. Systems =Tropical Storm One= A broad trough developed over the eastern Gulf of Mexico on May 26\\\\. A frontal disturbance formed over Florida along the trough, spawning an area of broad cyclonic turning. After emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean, a closed circulation developed within the system, and it is estimated that a tropical depression formed on May 28 about 100 mi (160 km) east of Jacksonville, Florida. Ship observations in the region suggested that the depression intensified into a tropical storm by late on May 28\\\\. The system was small, and was not discovered to have been a tropical cyclone until a reanalysis of data in 2015. The storm moved to the northeast ahead of an approaching trough, bypassing the Carolinas to the east; rainfall brushed the coast of North Carolina. On May 29, ship observations suggested peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). On the next day, the storm became associated with a warm front, indicating that it became extratropical to the southeast of New England. Continuing to the northeast, the former storm crossed over the southeastern coast of Newfoundland before being absorbed by another nontropical low to the northwest on May 31. =Tropical Storm Two= A trough formed over southern Florida on June 17\\\\. Early the next day, a circulation formed, signaling that a tropical depression also developed over the Everglades. The system moved slowly north-northeastward, emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean at 06:00 UTC on June 20\\\\. Shortly thereafter, the depression intensified into a tropical storm, although the structure was broad and asymmetric due to association with a nearby upper-level low, signaling that the system was possibly a subtropical cyclone. Ship reports in the region indicate that the storm continued to intensify. On June 22, the structure became much more symmetrical while passing just off the Outer Banks, bringing winds of 33 mph (54 km/h) to Wilmington, North Carolina. That day, the Hurricane Hunters estimated winds of 80 mph (130 km/h), and is possible that the storm briefly attained hurricane status. The peak winds were estimated at 70 mph (110 km/h), due to a pressure reading of . The storm accelerated northeastward due to an approaching cold front. On June 24, the storm became extratropical, and shortly thereafter made landfall along southwestern Nova Scotia. The system dissipated the next day over the northern Gulf of Saint Lawrence. =Hurricane Alice (June)= On June 24, Tropical Storm Alice developed rapidly in the western Gulf of Mexico, giving the citizens of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico little time to prepare. By June 25, Alice intensified to hurricane status, reaching peak winds of 110 mph (175 km/h) that day, before making landfall in northeastern Mexico, just south of the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States barrier. The storm progressed inland along the Rio Grande Valley, dissipating on June 27. In Mexico, Alice left minor damage, and killed one person due to a fallen power line. Across Texas, Alice dropped torrential rainfall, peaking at near Pandale, with most of the rainfall concentrated around the Pecos River. High precipitation accumulations occurred in areas that had seen little rains in three years. This led to significant flooding along the Pecos River that produced \\"probably the greatest rate of runoff for a watershed of [that] size in the United States\\", as reported by the International Boundary and Water Commission. Ozona, Texas sustained the most impact, estimated at $2 million in damage. Downstream, the Rio Grande rose to the highest level since 1865, which flooded seven towns on either side of the border; Eagle Pass, Texas was flooded with of water. Overall there were at least 55 deaths. =Tropical Storm Four= A dissipating cold front stalled over the southeastern United States from Arkansas to North Carolina on July 9\\\\. On the next day, a low pressure area developed along the coast of Georgia. Soon after, the front dissipated, and by 12:00 UTC on July 10, the system developed into a tropical storm. Observations from a coastal lighthouse and a nearby ship indicated that the storm attained peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) while moving slowly east-northeastward, just offshore the Carolinas. The storm began weakening on July 13, and dissipated the next day when it was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm that was developing to the north. =Tropical Storm Barbara= On July 27, a tropical depression developed in the northern Gulf of Mexico, about 100 mi (160 km) south of Grand Isle, Louisiana. A map of the low pressure areas forming in July 1954 indicated that the system originated near the Mississippi Delta and tracked southward. After forming, the depression tracked northwestward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Barbara early on July 28\\\\. Maximum sustained winds reached 45 mph (75 km/h), although a tanker offshore named the Henry M. Dawes reported wind gusts of . Officials at the United States Weather Bureau posted a storm warning from Cameron to Burrwood, Louisiana, and also advised small craft to remain at port along the entire northern Gulf Coast. Without intensifying further, Barbara made landfall near Vermilion Bay, Louisiana on July 29, dissipating the next day over Texas. The storm dropped heavy rainfall along its path, including over in New Orleans. The rains caused flooding as well as some damage to the rice crop. However, the Monthly Weather Review yearly summary described the precipitation as \\"far more beneficial than damaging\\". There was no wind damage. =Hurricane Carol= Carol developed from a tropical wave near the Bahamas on August 25\\\\. It quickly intensified as it tracked generally to the north, becoming a hurricane on August 27\\\\. Moving parallel to the coastline of the southeastern United States, Carol passed just east of Cape Hatteras with winds estimated at 110 mph (175 km/h). It intensified further as it accelerated, striking eastern Long Island as Category 3 hurricane. Carol made its final landfall on Old Saybrook, Connecticut late on August 31\\\\. Within a few hours, the hurricane became extratropical over New Hampshire, which later dissipated over Quebec. In North Carolina, hurricane-force winds left minor damage to houses, estimated around $228,000. Rains from Carol alleviated drought conditions in the Washington, D.C. area. On Long Island, the storm surge flooded the Montauk Highway with of water about a mile across. High winds left 275,000 homes without power, and damage totaled $3 million on the island. The hurricane moved ashore in Connecticut shortly after high tide, producing a storm surge of 10‚Äì15 ft (3‚Äì4.5 m) from New London eastward. The surge in Narragansett Bay reached , which surpassed that of the 1938 New England hurricane, which flooded downtown Providence with 12 feet (3.7 m) of water. In New London, rainfall peaked around . The hurricane produced winds of over in Connecticut and Rhode Island, including a record-high gust of 135 mph (215 km/h) at Block Island. Widespread areas were left without power from eastern Connecticut to southern Massachusetts. Further north in Maine, Hurricane Carol downed hundreds of trees, as well as destroying widespread apple groves and corn fields. It became the costliest natural disaster in the state's history, only to be surpassed by Hurricane Edna ten days later. Across New England, the hurricane destroyed about 4,000 homes, 3,500 cars, and 3,000 boats. Damage totaled $460 million, and there were 60 deaths. In neighboring Canada, high rains caused flooding while strong winds downed trees and power lines. =Hurricane Dolly= A tropical wave spawned a tropical depression on August 31 to the northwest of Puerto Rico. It moved rapidly north- northwestward, intensifying into Tropical Storm Dolly later that day and into a hurricane early on September 1. Early in the storm's duration, the U.S. Weather Bureau noted the potential for Dolly to affect the same areas of New England that Hurricane Carol struck just days prior. However, the hurricane turned to the north away from land. The Hurricane Hunters estimated maximum sustained winds of 85 mph (140 km/h) on September 2 after the storm passed about halfway between the Outer Banks and Bermuda. Dolly turned to the northeast on September 2 and became extratropical later that day to the south of Nova Scotia. It was tracked until September 4, until it was last located to the north of the Azores. There was no reported damage. =Hurricane Edna= As Dolly became extratropical, the tropical depression that later became Hurricane Edna developed east of the Lesser Antilles on September 2\\\\. It moved northwestward, dropping heavy rainfall on Puerto Rico as it passed north of the island. On September 7 Edna became a hurricane, and the next day reached peak winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). It turned to the north and northeast, bypassing the Outer Banks and skirting Cape Cod. On September 11, Edna struck Massachusetts as a strong Category 2 hurricane. The hurricane later moved ashore near the border between Maine and New Brunswick around the time it became extratropical. The remnants persisted a few more days before dissipating south of Greenland. Early in its duration, Edna produced high seas and gale-force winds in the Bahamas, but there was no damage there. Hurricane- force winds occurred in the Outer Banks, although damage was minor. As it passed New England, Edna produced a storm surge during a high tide, which caused severe flooding in Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, and Cape Cod. Wind gusts peaked at on Martha's Vineyard, and the strong winds across the region left widespread power outages. The hurricane dropped additional heavy rainfall to areas affected by Carol, resulting in flooding in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. In Long Island and New England, the hurricane left over $42 million in damage and 20 deaths, only 11 days after Carol affected the same area. About a third of the damage occurred in Maine, becoming the costliest hurricane on record in the state. Hurricane-force winds extended into Canada, causing $6 million in damage (1954 CAD), mostly from crop damage. There was one death in Nova Scotia. =Tropical Storm Nine= A surface trough persisted across the central Atlantic Ocean on September 2\\\\. Over the next few days, the system moved slowly northeastward, independent of any frontal systems. On September 6, nearby ships indicated that the a closed circulation had developed, marking the genesis of the system as a tropical depression. Accelerating to the northeast, the storm reached peak winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) on September 7\\\\. By the next day, the system became extratropical, and soon after was absorbed by a larger extratropical storm to the north. =Tropical Storm Florence= A tropical storm formed in the Bay of Campeche on September 11\\\\. Given the name Florence, the storm moved generally west-southwestward with a small radius of maximum winds. Hurricane Hunters reported winds of , although winds were initially (before reanalysis confirmed it was a tropical storm) estimated to have reached minimal hurricane force, or 75 mph (120 km/h). Before the storm moved ashore, officials in Veracruz evacuated residents from low-lying areas, and overall about 90,000 people left their homes. On September 12, Florence moved ashore between Tuxpan, and Nautla, Veracruz and quickly dissipated. The hurricane flooded coastal cities with up to of water, cutting off communications throughout the state. Damage was heaviest around Poza Rica, primarily from the destruction of banana plantations. Monetary damage was estimated around $1.5 million, and there were five reported deaths. =Tropical Storm Eleven= A low pressure area was present north of the Yucat√°n Peninsula on September 14\\\\. Nearby ship observations indicated that a tropical depression developed the next day in the central Gulf of Mexico, although the system's large structure meant it could have been a subtropical cyclone. The system moved slowly westward, bringing winds of 30 mph (45 km/h) to the coast of Louisiana. It is estimated that the storm reached peak winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) on September 16, based on reports from ships and the Hurricane Hunters. On the next day, the system began weakening over water, dissipating on September 18 without moving ashore. =Tropical Storm Gilda= On September 24, Tropical Storm Gilda developed in the central Caribbean Sea about halfway between Jamaica and Colombia. A small storm, it moved westward throughout its duration. On September 26, Gilda attained peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h) while nearing northeastern Honduras. The storm paralleled the coastline a short distance offshore, maintaining its intensity before hitting and later weakening over Belize on September 27\\\\. It re-emerged in the Gulf of Mexico before making another landfall near Tampico as a tropical depression on September 29, dissipating the next day. While moving just offshore the coast of Honduras, Gilda dropped intense rainfall, which flooding about 680 mi2 (1760 km2) of land along the Chamelec√≥n and Ul√∫a rivers. The waters caused the widespread destruction of banana plantations and houses, leaving about 3,000 people homeless. The United Fruit Company reacted to this destruction by firing 10,000 of its about 100,000 workers within Honduras. Honduras's then- President Juan Manuel G√°lvez appealed for aid from the United States. In response, U.S. Air Force planes flew food, medicine, rafts, and water purification tablets to the most-affected regions. A total of 29 people were killed in Honduras. When Gilda made its landfall in Belize, it left little property damage and no deaths. =Hurricane Thirteen= A tropical depression formed in the Central Atlantic on September 25\\\\. It drifted east- northeastward, eventually becoming a tropical storm on September 29\\\\. The storm curved to the west and west-southwest, becoming a hurricane on October 2\\\\. It turned to the northeast on October 3, and reached a peak of 100 mph (155 km/h) winds about halfway between Bermuda and the Azores. By that point it began accelerating, and late on October 6 the hurricane became extratropical over the Northeastern Atlantic. Early the next day it was last observed to the south of Iceland. The hurricane was not named due to its presence in the eastern Atlantic and not being a threat to land. =Unnumbered Tropical Depression= On October 2, a tropical depression moved westward from the coast of Cuba into the Gulf of Mexico. It moved westward without intensifying beyond winds of 35 mph (55 km/h), moving ashore about 40 mi (65 km) north of Brownsville, Texas. The depression weakened as it moved across southern Texas and dropped heavy rainfall. Brownsville recorded over 3 in (75 mm) in a 45-minute period, as well as about in six hours. The rainfall rates of about an inch per hour was the heaviest since June 1950. The depression also moved ashore with high waves and tides. When the system reached the Big Bend region on October 5 it reintensified slightly. Around that time, the United States Navy conducted a rocket test from White Sands, New Mexico; this was despite that such tests were rarely performed when the skies were cloudy. The rocket took an unintended photograph of the depression from an altitude of about 100 miles (160 km), which became the first such large-scale image of a tropical cyclone. The depression later moved into New Mexico and dropped additional rainfall, interacting with an approaching cold front. Flooding was reported around Roswell, as well as along the Pecos River system. Rainfall in the state peaked at in Canton, New Mexico. The system dissipated on October 7. =Hurricane Hazel= Hurricane Hazel was the deadliest and second costliest hurricane of the season. The storm killed as many as 1,000 people in Haiti before striking the United States near the border between North and South Carolina, as a Category 4 hurricane. After causing 95 fatalities in the U.S., Hazel struck Canada as an extratropical storm, raising the death toll by 81 people, mostly in Toronto. Hazel formed on October 5 just east of the Windward Islands and intensified into a Category 1 hurricane while crossing the southeastern Caribbean Sea. After making a hard turn northward, it rapidly intensified as it approached Haiti, reaching Category 3 intensity before landfall. In Haiti, Hazel destroyed 40% of the coffee trees and 50% of the cacao crop, affecting the economy for several years to come. It fluctuated in intensity before making landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in the Carolinas, which destroyed most waterfront dwellings near its point of impact. It affected several more states, including Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia, bringing gusts near 100 mph (160 km/h) and causing $308 million in damage. When Hazel arrived in Ontario, rivers and streams passing through the Greater Toronto Area overflowed their banks, causing severe flooding. As a result, many residential areas located in floodplains, such as the Raymore Drive area, were subsequently converted to parkland. In Canada alone, over C$135 million (2009: $1.1 billion) of damage was incurred. Hazel was particularly destructive in Toronto, as a result of a combination of a lack of experience in dealing with tropical storms and the storm's unexpected retention of power. Hazel had traveled over land, but while approaching Canada, it had merged with an existing powerful cold front. The storm stalled over the Greater Toronto Area, and although it was now extratropical, it remained as powerful as a category 1 hurricane. To help with the cleanup, 800 members of the military were summoned, and a Hurricane Relief Fund was established that distributed $5.1 million (2009: $41.7 million) in aid. =Tropical Storm Fifteen= On November 16, a tropical depression developed about halfway between the Lesser Antilles and the Azores. It moved to the west, intensifying into a tropical storm and reaching peak winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) (however, due to limited data, it is possible that the storm remained a tropical depression). The storm maintained that intensity on November 21 when it began weakening, dissipating later that day. =Hurricane Alice (December)= The final storm of the season, Alice, developed on December 30 from a trough of low pressure in the central Atlantic Ocean in an area of unusually favorable conditions. The storm moved southwestward and gradually strengthened to reach hurricane status. It persisted into the following calendar year, passing through the Leeward Islands on January 2\\\\. Alice reached peak winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) before encountering cold air and turning to the southeast. It dissipated on January 6 over the southeastern Caribbean Sea. Alice produced heavy rainfall and moderately strong winds across several islands along its path. Saba and Anguilla were affected the most, with total damage amounting to $623,500 (1955 USD). Operationally, lack of definitive data prevented the U.S. Weather Bureau from declaring the system a hurricane until January 2\\\\. It received the name Alice in early 1955, though re-analysis of the data supported extending its track to the previous year, resulting in two tropical cyclones of the same name in one season. It was one of only two storms to span two calendar years, along with Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005‚Äì06.  Storm names  The following names were used for named storms (tropical storms and hurricanes) that formed in the North Atlantic in 1954. The list was the same as 1953 with the exception of Gilda, which replaced Gail due to the name's confusion with the term gale. Names that were not assigned are marked in . *Alice (1) *Barbara *Carol *Dolly *Edna *Florence *Gilda *Hazel *Alice (2)      =Retirement= The name Carol was re-used in the 1965 season, but was retroactively retired when the modern naming system was introduced. Edna was reused in 1968 and retired. Hazel was not re-used and was retired.

Magic on the Early English Stage, p.3. . Toss juggling can be used as: a performing art, a sport, a form of exercise, as meditation, a recreational pursuit or hobby. In toss juggling, objects -- such as balls, bean bags, rings, clubs, etc. -- are thrown or tossed into the air and caught. Toss juggling is a form of object manipulation.  Juggling techniques and patterns  'Toss juggling' has a number of basic principles and patterns. Most of the more complex patterns are variations of the basic ones and all toss juggling must conform to these basic principles. =Basic principles= Toss juggling is, according to most sources, the throwing and catching of objects, where there are more objects than there are hands (or sometimes other parts of the body) doing the throwing and catching.For example, . Cited in Rosenberger, Phillip (2011). Juggling Basics, Why and How To. . Three balls thrown and caught between two hands is toss juggling, as there are more balls than hands. Two balls between two hands would not be considered toss juggling, as the number of balls and hands is equal. =Basic patterns= There are three basic patterns in toss juggling with many variations, some exceedingly complex, that are based on these basic patterns. Shower alt=Shower The shower is the most commonly depicted pattern in pictures and illustrations of jugglers (although often wildly exaggerated). The objects juggled follow a circular pattern with one hand doing higher throws and the other passing or doing low throws to the first hand. This pattern can be used to juggle an odd number or even number of objects. In siteswap notation, a three object shower would be called 51. Cascade alt=Cascade The cascade pattern is often the first pattern taught to beginner jugglers. The objects juggled follow a horizontal figure of eight pattern with each hand throwing the object to the same height when the previous throw has reached it peak. This pattern is most commonly used to juggle an odd number of objects. In siteswap notation, a three object cascade would be called 3. Fountain alt=Fountain The fountain is where each hand throws and catches objects and they do not transfer to the opposite hand. This pattern is most commonly used to juggle an even number of objects. In siteswap notation, a four object fountain would be called 4. = Advanced patterns and tricks = alt=Box alt=Column alt=Mill's mess Besides the cascade (or reverse cascade), other toss patterns include the box or column, and any number of multiplex patterns or contact juggling tricks within the pattern. There are also amusing stunts such as the Yo-yo and the Robot, which give the illusion that the balls are connected to each other or to the juggler's body. By adding elementary skills to any juggling pattern the pattern can be increased, incrementally, in complexity. There are even wildly intricate patterns such as the Mills Mess, which is widely attributed to Steve Mills of The Dazzling Mills Family. For a given pattern any number of variants may occur to the juggler, for instance, Mills Mess has at least three well-known variants, produced by adding flourishes such as chops, holds, stalls, and carries. \\"Mills\\" colloquially refers to any pattern in juggling where the hands cross back and forth over one another. Any pattern valid in siteswap notation can be done \\"vanilla\\", reverse, and in Mills. = Other patterns = Below is a list of other common three-ball patterns. * Burke's Barrage * Rubenstein's Revenge * Flash  Performance  Toss juggling - street performance in Denmark Juggling has been used as a performance skill for thousands of years. Toss juggling has been significant in such performances and has continued to be a major part of juggling performances up to the present day. Juggling performances are of two main types: a performance which shows off the technical skill of the juggler and a performance of juggling with comedy. These two main types can be performed as shows, as walkabout entertainment or as stationary freestyle entertainment. All types of performances can be accompanied by music, other circus skills or other performers. Passing and feeding Passing is the juggling skill of throwing objects between two or more jugglers. The most common passing combination is where two jugglers throw six objects between them and perform various tricks in addition to that basic pattern. The number of objects juggled between two people can be increased with 7, 8 and even nine object passing being a common occurrence. Higher numbers have also been achieved with the current record for club passing being 13 clubs passed (juggled) between the two jugglers. A variation on passing, called feeding, is performed by three or more jugglers. The most common combination is performed by three jugglers: one juggler (the feeder) passes alternately to each of the other two jugglers (the feedees) while they stand in a 'triangle'. The tempo of the juggling as well as the way the objects are thrown between the jugglers can be varied. Feeding can be performed with one feeder feeding multiple feedees or a mix of multiple feeders and feedees in one pattern. Passing and feeding patterns and tricks in toss juggling range from the simple to the very complex. New patterns and tricks are developed and practiced at juggling conventions.  Sport  As a sport, juggling can be done competitively, with the jugglers attempting to improve upon the tricks or performances of other jugglers within a range of disciplines and categories. Competitions are held for both solo and multiple juggling competitors. Jason Garfield popularised this form of juggling in the USA. This style of juggling became more popular after he organised a World Juggling Federation competition in 2004 which has now become an annual event.  Exercise and fitness  As exercise, juggling is a highly aerobic activity, increasing the heart rate and respiration. Juggling helps one to develop good hand-eye coordination, physical fitness and balance. = Reflexes = Juggling helps to develop quick reflexes, and in fact, jugglers develop \\"higher-order reflexes\\", reflexes not typically associated with normal human activity. These reflexes are formed through repetition of what are, at first, slowly learned and difficult processes. As the various processes develop into reflexive actions, additional, more difficult or complex skills are 'layered' atop previous, well-developed skills. These new more complex skills eventually become more reflexive, and eventually, various unusual high order reflexes develop. An example is that, while catching a raw chicken's egg may be quite challenging to a novice juggler, a more skilled juggler might be able to easily catch -- unbroken -- an egg thrown towards him without warning.  Meditation  Paradoxically, the same processes that are well known for exercising the body, can also be a very relaxing activity. As meditation, juggling a repeating pattern or patterns can take one's mind off the stresses they might encounter in their daily lives. Jugglers have described a phenomenon of near-disembodiment and tranquility which may come over them while juggling. The constant rising and falling of the objects, the regularity of the rhythms, can become almost hypnotic, and the attention of a juggler while tightly focused on the juggling pattern may seem to expand and even to \\"encompass the universe.\\"  Recreation  As a recreational pursuit, juggling excels in many ways. Besides the previously mentioned health benefits, any form of juggling is at its best when done socially. The equipment is inexpensive or free -- though very costly equipment is also available -- and easily portable. Juggling is great for \\"breaking the ice\\" at parties and other social gatherings . Jugglers are a friendly sort, usually, and are often very willing to help beginning jugglers with advice. Juggling conventions, clubs and other gatherings where jugglers congregate can be great places to meet and share the art of juggling, for experts novices and even 'non-jugglers' -- who often find themselves doing some form of juggling themselves. In 1990 it was estimated by the International Jugglers' Association that twenty-three percent of Americans can juggle a three-ball cascade.Juggler's World Vol. 42 #3. Cited in Havlick, Joseph T.

The classical complement pathway is one of three pathways which activate the complement system, which is part of the immune system. The classical complement pathway is initiated by antigen-antibody complexes with the antibody isotypes IgG and IgM. Following activation, a series of proteins are recruited to generate C3 convertase (C4b2b, historically referred C4b2a), which cleaves the C3 protein. The C3b component of the cleaved C3 binds to C3 convertase (C4b2b) to generate C5 convertase (C4b2b3b), which cleaves the C5 protein. The cleaved products attract phagocytes to the site of infection and tags target cells for elimination by phagocytosis. In addition, the C5 convertase initiates the terminal phase of the complement system, leading to the assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC). The membrane attack complex creates a pore on the target cell's membrane, inducing cell lysis and death. The classical complement pathway can also be activated by apoptotic cells, necrotic cells, and acute phase proteins. Complement cascade The classical complement pathway leading into a complement cascade that is shared with the alternative pathway. The classical pathway is distinct from the other complement pathways in its unique activation triggers and cascade sequence. Activation of the complement pathway through the classical, lectin or alternative complement pathway is followed by a cascade of reactions eventually leading to the membrane attack complex. =Initiation= The classical complement pathway can be initiated by the binding of antigen- antibody complexes to the C1q protein. The globular regions of C1q recognize and bind to the Fc region of antibody isotypes IgG or IgM. These globular regions of C1q can also bind to bacterial and viral surface proteins, apoptotic cells, and acute phase proteins. In the absence of these activation factors, C1q is part of the inactive C1 complex which consists of six molecules of C1q, two molecules of C1r, and two molecules of C1s. = Formation of C3 convertase = The binding of C1q leads to conformational changes and the activation of the serine protease C1r. The activated C1r then cleaves and activates the serine protease C1s. The activated C1s cleaves C4 into C4a and C4b, and C2 into C2a and C2b. The larger fragments C4b and C2aOverview of Complement Activation and Regulation form C4b2b (according to old terminology, C2a and C4b2a), a C3 convertase of the classical pathway. C3 convertase then cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b. While the anaphylatoxin C3a interacts with its C3a receptor (C3aR) to recruit leukocytes, C3b contributes to further downstream complement activation. =Formation of C5 convertase and MAC= C3b binds to the C3 convertase (C4b2b), to form C5 convertase (C4b2b3b). C5 convertase then cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b. Like C3a, C5a is also an anaphylatoxin that interacts with its cognate C5a receptor (C5aR) to attract leukocytes. Subsequent interactions between C5b and other terminal components C6, C7, C8, and C9 form the membrane attack complex or the C5b-9 complex which forms pores on the target cell membranes to lysing.  Clinical significance  Because of its role in the innate immune system classical complement has been implicated in a number of pathogen related disorders. Complement is responsible for immune inflammatory response in adipose tissues which has been implicated in the development of obesity. Obesity in turn results in an abnormally high level of complement activation via production of the C1 component of the classical pathway, which can lead to tissue inflammation and eventually insulin resistance, however the exact mechanisms that causes this is yet unknown. Immunotherapies have been developed to detect and destroy cells infected by the HIV virus via classical complement activation. This process involves creating synthetic peptides that target conserved regions in HIV specific proteins and induce an antibody specific immune response through IgG antibodies. This is important for targeting the virus in its intracellular phase because the antibodies specific to the synthetic peptides can trigger the classical complement pathway and induce the death of HIV infected cells. Classical complement activation has also been shown to combat Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Certain variants of the IgM antibody were found to bind the Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus these IgM were found to be critical in complement activation through the classical pathway and subsequent destruction of the bacteria. Therapies that utilize classical complement activation have been shown to be effective in targeting and killing cancer cells and destroying tumors. Tachyplesin, a small peptide, has been shown to exhibit these effects. When injected into target tissue encourages recruitment of C1q and activates downstream events, eventually leading to the formation of the C5b-9 complex which damages tumor cells, killing them. Lack of regulation of the classical complement pathway through the deficiency in C1-inhibitor results in episodic angioedema. C1-inhibitor defiency can be hereditary or acquired, resulting in hereditary or acquired angioedema. C1-inhibitor plays the role of inactivating C1r and C1s to prevent further downstream classical complement activity. C1-inhibitor controls the processes involved in maintaining vascular permeability. As a result, C1-inhibitor levels of less than 50% of the standard lead to increased vascular permeability, characteristic of angioedema. Cinryze, a human plasma derived C1-esterase inhibitor, has been approved for use in 2008 for the prevention of hereditary angioedema attacks. Deficiency in the C1q protein of the classical complement pathway can lead to development of systemic lupus erythematosus. Among the many functions of C1q, C1q triggers clearance of immune complexes and apoptotic cells by activating the classical pathway and binding directly onto phagocytes. Consequently, systemic lupus erythematosus from insufficient amounts of C1q is characterized by the accumulation of autoantibodies and apoptotic cells. Studies are being done to look into antibodies against C1q as a diagnostic marker for systemic lupus erythematosus.

Alternative pathway. (Some labels are in Polish.) The alternative pathway of the complement system is an innate component of the immune system's natural defense against infections. The alternative pathway is one of three complement pathways that opsonize and kill pathogens. The pathway is triggered when the C3b protein directly binds a microbe. It can also be triggered by foreign materials and damaged tissues. Cascade This change in shape allows the binding of plasma protein Factor B, which allows Factor D to cleave Factor B into Ba and Bb. Bb remains bound to C3(H2O) to form C3(H2O)Bb. This complex is also known as a fluid-phase C3-convertase. This convertase, the alternative pathway C3-convertase, although only produced in small amounts, can cleave multiple C3 proteins into C3a and C3b. The complex is believed to be unstable until it binds properdin, a serum protein. The addition of properdin forms the complex C3bBbP, a stable compound which can bind an additional C3b to form alternative pathway C5-convertase. The C5-convertase of the alternative pathway consists of (C3b)2BbP (sometimes referred to as C3b2Bb). After the creation of C5 convertase (either as (C3b)2BbP or C4b2a3b from the classical pathway), the complement system follows the same path regardless of the means of activation (alternative, classical, or lectin). C5-convertase cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b. C5b binds sequentially to C6, C7, C8 and then to multiple molecules of C9 to form membrane attack complex. Regulation Since C3b is free and abundant in the plasma, it can bind to either a host cell or a pathogen surface. To prevent complement activation from proceeding on the host cell, there are several different kinds of regulatory proteins that disrupt the complement activation process: * Complement Receptor 1 (CR1 or CD35) and DAF (decay accelerating factor also known as CD55) compete with Factor B in binding with C3b on the cell surface and can even remove Bb from an already formed C3bBb complex * The formation of a C3 convertase can also be prevented when a plasma protease called complement factor I cleaves C3b into its inactive form, iC3b. Factor I requires a C3b-binding protein cofactor such as complement factor H, CR1, or Membrane Cofactor of Proteolysis (MCP or CD46) * Complement Factor H can inhibit the formation of the C3 convertase by competing with factor B for binding to C3b; accelerate the decay of the C3 convertase; and act as a cofactor for Factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b. Complement factor H preferentially binds to vertebrate cells (because of affinity for sialic acid residues), allowing preferential protection of host (as opposed to bacterial) cells from complement-mediated damage. * CFHR5 (Complement Factor H-Related protein 5) is able to bind to act as a cofactor for factor I, has decay accelerating activity and is able to bind preferentially to C3b at host surfaces. Role in disease Dysregulation of the complement system has been implicated in several diseases and pathologies, including Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome in which kidney function is compromised. Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is now believed to be caused, at least in part, by complement mediated attack on ocular tissues. Alternative pathway activation might also play a significant role in kidney pathology associated with lupus.

He was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in The Flight of the Phoenix (1965), as well as two BAFTA Film Awards for his performances in The Offence (1973) and Hope and Glory (1987). Bannen's other notable roles were in The Hill (1965), Penelope (1966), From Beyond the Grave (1974), Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (1979), Eye of the Needle (1981), Braveheart (1995) and Waking Ned Devine (1998), which earned him a Satellite Award. Early life Bannen was born in Airdrie, Lanarkshire, the son of Clare (n√©e Galloway) and John James Bannen, a lawyer.Film Reference biography Bannen served in the British Army after attending St Aloysius' College, Glasgow and Ratcliffe College, Leicestershire. His first acting role came in a 1947 Dublin stage production of Armlet of Jade. He became a successful figure on the London stage, making a name for himself in the plays of both Shakespeare and Eugene O'Neill. He was an original member of the Royal Shakespeare Company and appeared on Broadway as well. Career His film debut occurred in the early 1950s with a small role in Pool of London (1951), and he quickly rose to prominence, primarily in a wide range of supporting roles. He had a very significant role as Stoker Samuel Bannister in Yangtse Incident. During the early stages of his career he worked with the Boulting Brothers on Private's Progress and Carlton-Browne of the F.O.. His performance as Crow in The Flight of the Phoenix (1965) earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor, making him the first Scottish actor to receive this honour; he also received a Golden Globe nomination for New Star of the Year - Actor. That same year, he starred alongside Sean Connery in the WWII prison drama, The Hill. Bannen turned down lead roles in Hawaii Five-O, Van der Valk and The Love Boat. His notable television appearances include parts in Doctor Finlay, Thriller, and as a schoolteacher and ex-spy in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. Director John Schlesinger cast him as a replacement for Alan Bates in the part of well-off homosexual doctor Daniel Hirsh in his controversial film Sunday Bloody Sunday (1971), after Bates was deemed unavailable to shoot. According to screenwriter Penelope Gilliatt, Bannen never felt comfortable with the part. The anxiety adversely affected his performance during the early filming. Schlesinger replaced Bannen with Peter Finch, who received an Oscar nomination for the role. Acclaim Ian Bannen received an Academy Award nomination in 1965 for Best Supporting Actor, for his performance in The Flight of the Phoenix as Ratbags Crow, one of the survivors of a plane crash. He also received a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as suspected child molester Kenneth Baxter in The Offence (1973). He also won acclaim for his roles as Brother Benedict in Lamb (1986), Grandfather George in John Boorman's Hope and Glory (1987) (for which he received a second Best Supporting Actor BAFTA nomination), the elder Robert de Brus in Braveheart (1995) and as the touchingly crafty villager in Waking Ned Devine (1998). In 1996, he was honoured with the BAFTA Lifetime Achievement Award.The Independent obituary He was the subject of an episode of This is Your Life in 1999, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel.

Each chapter is a short story unto itself. It tells the story of a werewolf haunting a small town as the moon turns full once every month. It was published as a limited- edition hardcover in 1983 by Land of Enchantment, and in 1985 as a mass-market trade paperback by Signet. King also wrote the screenplay for its film adaptation, Silver Bullet (1985). At 127 pages, it is King's shortest novel to date, which makes it technically a novella. Characters =The Coslaw family= ; Marty Coslaw : Marty Coslaw, a 10-year-old paraplegic, serves as the novella‚Äôs protagonist. He hears the werewolf howling in March and is attacked by the beast in July, where he blinds it in one eye with a package of Black Cat firecrackers. He discovers the identity of the creature to be Reverend Lester Lowe in October and kills him with a silver bullet in December. ; Nan Coslaw : Marty‚Äôs mother, she tries to treat him as if he were no different from any other 10-year-old boy. ; Herman Coslaw : Marty‚Äôs father, he is uncomfortable interacting with his disabled son, speaking to him in a patronizing voice (called the 'Big Pal' voice by Marty). He is the coach at Tarker‚Äôs Mills High School. ; Kate Coslaw : Marty‚Äôs 14-year-old sister, she seems jealous of all the attention Marty gets throughout much of the novella. ; Grandpa Coslaw : Marty‚Äôs paternal grandfather, he lives with the family. Marty has a good relationship with his grandfather, who is described as being the typical grandfather. He is noted for being a heavy sleeper. ; Uncle Al : Marty‚Äôs wild-living maternal uncle, he always seems to be in the doghouse with his sister. Al treats Marty better than anyone else in the story, and buys him the fireworks Marty uses to blind the werewolf in one eye after the Fourth of July fireworks are cancelled. He also supplies Marty with the silver bullets and the gun he uses to kill the beast in December. =The werewolf= Reverend Lester Lowe, the werewolf, is first mentioned in the story in April, preaching a sermon about the coming of spring. Around May, he has a nightmare in which his entire congregation‚Äîand then he himself‚Äîtransform into werewolves before he awakens. The next morning, he finds Clyde Corliss, a custodian, dead on the pulpit at his church. He is seen as a pillar of the community and has been viewed that way for years, coming to call Tarker‚Äôs Mills home. Lowe has not been a werewolf his entire life, nor has he been a werewolf since he first arrived in Tarker‚Äôs Mills. In fact, it is never explained (nor that he has any idea) about how he became a werewolf, but he suspects that it has something to do with some flowers he picked at a cemetery on Sunshine Hill months prior to his first transformation. He went to put them in vases at the church vestry, but they turned black and died before he could finish the relatively quick job. He has no reason to pinpoint this event as the beginning of his curse, but he believes that this was the beginning of the events. As the werewolf, he serves as the primary antagonist of the novella. Lowe comes to realize that he is the werewolf after having awakened with fresh blood on his fingernails and (to his horror) mouth. He also discovers his clothes are missing or sometimes finds scratches and bruises, which appear to have come from running through the woods. The nightmare in May serves as a further omen to his curse, but he doesn't fully realize his curse until July 5, when he awakens with his left eye blasted out. After Halloween, he began getting anonymous letters from someone who knows his secret, suspecting that it is the person whom he attacked in July and failed to kill, the person who blasted his left eye out. In November, he acknowledges that he is the werewolf and decides that he cannot risk going out in the woods, as he could be killed by the group of vigilantes who had taken to the woods that month. To avoid the vigilantes, he travels to Portland, where he kills Tarker‚Äôs Mills resident Milt Sturmfuller outside a cheap motel. After returning home, he decides to find out whom he attacked in July, and confront that person. Marty eventually signs his name to the last letter he sends in December, shortly before the next full moon. Lowe is killed by Marty on New Year‚Äôs Eve. =The victims= ;Arnie Westrum : Arnie is a railroad employee killed sometime in the wee hours of the morning on New Year‚Äôs Day in January. He was snowbound in a blizzard after trying to clear snowdrifts off the tracks which had blocked the trains. Westrum manages to hit the werewolf with a pick axe once before it killed him. ; Stella Randolph : Stella is a virginal seamstress whose business is beginning to fail. On Valentine‚Äôs Day in February, she sends herself cards from 1980s heartthrobs and longs for a lover. She sees the werewolf watching her from outside her window and lets it in, believing she is dreaming. The werewolf pounces on her and kills Stella in her bed. ; The drifter : A drifter killed on St. Patrick‚Äôs Day in March, he is found by an employee of the Electric and Gas Company while searching for downed lines. His body is surrounded by wolf prints. ; Brady Kincaid : Brady Kincaid is an 11-year-old boy killed while flying his kite on April Fool‚Äôs Day. He had an expensive kite and stayed out too late as he became fascinated by it. He is found the next day, decapitated and disemboweled in the town park. ; Clyde Corliss : Corliss is found dead in the Grace Baptist Church by Reverend Lowe on Homecoming Sunday in May. He had done janitorial work at the church since the late 1970s. ; Alfie Knopfler : Knopfler is the owner of the Chat ‚Äòn‚Äô Chew, the town‚Äôs only diner. He is killed after high-school graduation in June in his diner. He sees the werewolf transform in front of him before he is killed. ; Constable Lander Neary : Neary is the town constable and is frustrated by his inability to solve the case and by his patronizing treatment by the Maine State Police. Neary reveals that Marty was sent to stay with some relatives in Stowe, Vermont, for a few days after his attack in July. His fellow troopers don't let Neary interview the boy, but allow him to have a copy of the deposition Marty gave to them. In it, Marty describes the werewolf in vivid detail, which both the troopers and Neary ignore, including the fact that the werewolf is now missing his or her left eye in human form. Had they not ignored this fact, they could have apprehended Lowe immediately. Both Neary and the troopers believe Marty is suffering from extreme post-traumatic stress syndrome and that the werewolf is a manifestation by Marty‚Äôs psyche as a mental block to the trauma. Neary is killed in August while drinking in his parked truck. ; Elmer Zinneman's pigs : Zinneman is a pig farmer who has his entire pen of pigs killed by the werewolf, but manages to avoid being killed himself on Labor Day in September. He sees something indeterminate running into the woods after his last pig dies, but he cannot say who or what it is that he saw. The next day, he discusses the carnage with his brother Pete from two counties away. Pete tells Elmer that he knows that a werewolf is on the loose in Tarker‚Äôs Mills, citing the unusual tracks in the mud as evidence. The two decide to begin hunting for the beast in November. ; Milt Sturmfuller : Sturmfuller is the town librarian who is shown to physically abuse his wife in March and again in October. He begins an affair in November and starts staying at a hotel in Portland. He's ironically killed by the werewolf while at the hotel in Portland, Lowe having gone there to avoid the vigilante group set up by Zinneman. Synopsis 1985 paperback cover The story is set in the fictional town of Tarker's Mills, Maine. Each chapter is a month on the calendar. A werewolf is viciously killing local citizens at each full moon, and the otherwise normal town is living in fear. The protagonist of the story is Marty Coslaw, a 10 year-old boy in a wheelchair. The story goes back and forth from the terrifying incidents to Marty's youthful day-to-day life and how the horror affects him. The werewolf's first victim is a drunk railroad worker. Next is a woman in her bedroom contemplating suicide, followed by a hitchhiker, an abusive husband, one of Marty's friends in the city park, a herd of hogs at a local farm, a sheriff's deputy while he sits in his car, and finally the owner of a diner. In July, the town's Independence Day fireworks have been cancelled. This is very upsetting to Marty, who has been looking forward to them all year. Feeling bad for his nephew, Marty's uncle brings him some fireworks, warning Marty to set them off really late so his mother won't find out. While outside enjoying his own private Independence Day celebration, the werewolf attacks Marty, who manages to put out the monster's left eye with a package of firecrackers. The werewolf escapes and police ignore Marty's report because they are looking for a human murderer, not a werewolf. As the summer continues, the bloodshed occurs again every full moon. Fall comes and so does Halloween. To celebrate, Marty goes trick-or-treating with his sister. While out, he sees Reverend Lowe wearing an eyepatch. However, Lowe doesn't recognize Marty, as his face is covered by a Yoda mask. Marty, whose family is Catholic, never attend services at Lowe's church, which is why he didn't work out the werewolf's identity sooner. Over the next few weeks, Marty sends the pastor anonymous letters asking him why he doesn't kill himself and end the terror. In December, he sends the last letter‚Äîsigned with his name. Unbeknownst to Reverend Lowe, Marty has convinced his somewhat reluctant uncle to have two silver bullets made and to come spend New Year's Eve (which falls on the full moon) with his sister and him. Right before midnight, the werewolf breaks into the house to kill Marty. Marty shoots the werewolf twice with the silver bullets. After the wolf dies, it changes back into Reverend Lowe, much to the shock of everyone present. Background The novella started out as a calendar by Zavista with illustrations by renowned comic-book artist Bernie Wrightson. Each month featured a drawing by Wrightson complete with a short vignette by King. King found the size of the vignettes, which were both small and extremely limited, to be a problem. King proceeded with a short novel and had it published by Land of Enchantment in 1983, complete with Wrightson‚Äôs illustrations.HorrorKing.com In the author's notes at the back of the novella, King admits to taking liberties with the lunar cycle. For example, if a full moon was on New Year's Day, another one wouldn't occur on Valentine's Day, but these dates are widely recognized in January and February. He explains that this was done to focus the relevant months more clearly in the readers' minds. Reception Dave Langford reviewed Cycle of the Werewolf for White Dwarf #72, and stated that \\"This is of course a werewolf yarn, competently told despite wearying heaps of bodies before we get any actual plot; the triumph of the cute, crippled kid detective over Incarnate Evil comes as no surprise. OK, but expensive for a short story.\\" Film adaptation Silver Bullet paperback cover The novel was adapted into a film, Silver Bullet, in 1985, starring Corey Haim as Marty, Everett McGill as Reverend Lowe, Gary Busey as Marty‚Äôs uncle, Megan Follows as Marty‚Äôs sister, Terry O'Quinn as the local sheriff, Kent Broadhurst as Brady's father, and James Gammon as Arnie Westrum. The movie received mixed reviews and it has since achieved cult status in the US, after appearing on television regularly. In 1985, Signet Books re-issued Cycle of the Werewolf under the title Silver Bullet in an edition that included King's screenplay alongside the original novella. This edition also includes a foreword by King, recounting the impetus of the novella and the background of the film adaptation.

The department was charged with responsibility for developing and implementing national policy, programs and legislation to protect and conserve Australia's environment and heritage. Structure The department was an Australian Public Service Department of State in the environment portfolio, under the Public Service Act 1999. The head of the department was its Secretary, Dr Gordon de Brouwer , responsible to the Minister for the Environment, the Hon. Josh Frydenberg . History The department was formed by way of an Administrative Arrangements Order issued on 18 September 2013. It absorbed the responsibilities of the former Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities (DSWEPaC) and climate change from the former Department of Industry, Innovation, Climate Change, Science, Research and Tertiary Education. The department was dissolved in July 2016 and its functions, along with energy policy functions, were moved to the newly established Department of the Environment and Energy. From when it was established in September 2013 to when it was dissolved in July 2016 the department faced significant cuts (25 per cent cut from the organisation's budget over four years), in line with the Coalition Government's environmental deregulation policies.  Mission  The stated aims of the department were to achieve the protection and conservation of the environment; to ensure that Australia benefits from meteorological and related sciences and services; and to see that Australia's interests in Antarctica are advanced. The department developed and implemented national policy, programs and legislation to protect and conserve Australia's environment and heritage. Operational activities The functions of the department were broadly classified into the following matters: *The Great Barrier Reef *Environment protection and conservation of biodiversity *Air quality *National fuel quality standards *Land contamination *Meteorology *Administration of the Australian Antarctic Territory, and the Territory of the Heard Island and McDonald Islands *Natural, built and cultural heritage *Environmental information and research *Ionospheric prediction *Co-ordination of sustainable communities policy *Population policy *Urban environment *Development and co-ordination of domestic climate change policy *Renewable energy target policy, regulation and co-ordination *Greenhouse emissions and energy consumption reporting *Climate change adaptation strategy and co-ordination *Co-ordination of climate change science activities *Renewable energy *Greenhouse gas abatement programs *Community and household climate action *Water policy and resources = Programs = The department managed a number of major programs. The most significant of those dealing with natural resource management came under the umbrella of the Natural Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. Both the Trust and National Action Plan were administered jointly with the Department of Agriculture. = Divisions = Divisions of the department included the Australian Antarctic Division, Supervising Scientist Division, Heritage Division, Parks Australia, Policy and Communications, Australian Wildlife, Sydney Harbour Federation Trust, Australian Land and Coasts plus a number of executive agencies and statutory authorities. = Environmental protection = The Department of the Environment administered environmental laws, including the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and a range of other Acts. It was also responsible for Australia's participation in a number of international environmental agreements. = Islands administration = The department administered areas of the Coral Sea Islands, Heard Island and the McDonald Islands, and oversees certain policy areas in Norfolk Island and Christmas Island.

A member of the Hofstad Network, he was incarcerated in 2004. Early life Mohammed Bouyeri is a second-generation Moroccan-Dutchman of Berber origin. In 1995, Mohammed Bouyeri finished his secondary education. He changed his major several times and left after five years without obtaining a degree. A second- generation migrant from Morocco, Bouyeri used the pen name \\"Abu Zubair\\" for writing and translating. He often posted letters online and sent e-mails under this name. At an early age he was known to the police as a member of a group of Moroccan \\"problem-youth\\". For a while he worked as a volunteer at Eigenwijks, a neighbourhood organization in Amsterdam's Slotervaart suburb. After his mother died and his father remarried in the fall of 2003, he started to live according to strict interpretations of Sunni Islamic Sharia law. As a result, he could perform fewer and fewer tasks at Eigenwijks. For example, he refused to serve alcohol and did not want to be present at activities attended by both women and men. Finally, he put an end to his activities at Eigenwijks altogether. He grew a beard and began to wear a djellaba. He frequently visited the El Tawheed mosque where he met other radical Sunnis, among whom was the suspected terrorist Samir Azzouz. With the group of radicals he is said to have formed the Hofstad Network, a Dutch terrorist cell. Assassination of Theo van Gogh =Background= Filmmaker Theo van Gogh was a vigorous and often polemic critic of several aspects and figures of Dutch society, including religion. In 2004, van Gogh and Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Somali refugee who has become a member of the House of Representatives of the Netherlands, directed a short film called Submission, Part I about Islam and violence against women. In the film, women are shown wearing transparent clothes with verses of the Quran written on their bodies. The film first aired in August 2004 on Dutch television in prime time. The ensuing outcry led the Dutch police to offer police protection for both van Gogh and Hirsi Ali, but van Gogh refused. =Assassination= The 26-year-old Bouyeri assassinated van Gogh in the early morning of 2 November 2004 in front of the Amsterdam-Oost borough office (Dutch: stadsdeelkantoor) while he was bicycling to work.\\"Gunman kills Dutch film director\\" , BBC, retrieved July 21, 2009. Bouyeri shot van Gogh eight times with a handgun and also wounded two bystanders. Wounded, van Gogh ran to the other side of the road and fell to the ground on the cycle lane. According to eyewitnesses, van Gogh's last words were: \\"Mercy, mercy! We can talk about it, can't we?\\" Bouyeri then walked up to van Gogh, who was still lying down, and shot him several more times at close range. Bouyeri then cut van Gogh's throat and tried to decapitate him with a large knife, after which he stabbed the knife deep into van Gogh's chest, reaching his spinal cord. He then attached a five-page note to the body with a smaller knife before fleeing. Van Gogh died on the spot. The written note contained a warning to Ayaan Hirsi Ali. It also made mention of the Jewish political actors in Ali's party, as well as other parties in Dutch politics. It contained repeated references to Jewish party-backers and party leaders. The letter refers to the fundamentalist ideology of the Takfir wal- Hijra. This letter probably was not written by Mohammed Bouyeri himself, but by his group's ideologist. It was signed Saifu Deen alMuwahhied. =Arrest= Following an exchange of gunfire with police, during which he was shot in the leg, police arrested Bouyeri close to the scene of the crime shortly after its commission. In his interrogations, he exercised his right to remain silent. On 11 November, public prosecutor Leo de Wit charged him with six criminal acts: murder, attempted murder (of a police officer), attempted manslaughter (of by- standers and police officers), violation of the law on gun control, suspicion of participation in a criminal organization with terrorist aims, and conspiracy to murder with a terrorist purpose against van Gogh, Representative Ayaan Hirsi Ali, and others. When arrested, Bouyeri had on him a farewell poem titled In bloed gedoopt (\\"Baptized in Blood\\"), which makes it appear that he intended to die a martyr. =Trial= Bouyeri's trial took place over two days, 11 and 12 July 2005, in a high-security building in Amsterdam's Osdorp neighbourhood. In a letter on 8 July, Bouyeri announced that he would not attend the trial voluntarily and that he did not accept its jurisdiction.\\"Man accused of van Gogh killing refuses to recognise Dutch court\\" , The Independent. The prosecutor demanded that he be forcibly transported to the courthouse, which the court granted. Bouyeri's lawyers attended the trial, but they did not ask questions or make closing statements. Bouyeri appeared before the court carrying a Quran under his arm.Jan Kanter: \\"Mohammed B. schweigt\\" , Die Welt, 12 July 2005. At the trial, Bouyeri expressed no remorse for the murder he admitted to having committed, telling the victim's mother, \\"I do not feel your pain. I do not have any sympathy for you. I cannot feel for you because I think you are a non-believer.\\"Anthony Browne: \\"Muslim radical confesses to van Gogh killing in court tirade\\" , The Times, 12 July 2005. Bouyeri also expressed that he would have done it again if he had the chance. Bouyeri also argued that \\"in the fight of the believers against the infidels, violence is approved by the prophet Muhammad\\".Jan Kanter, \\"Van-Gogh-M√∂rder h√§lt Attentat f√ºr Waffe im Glaubenskampf\\" , Die Welt, 3 February 2006. The prosecutor demanded life imprisonment for Bouyeri, stating, \\"The defendant rejects our democracy. He even wants to bring down our democracy. With violence. He is insistent. To this day. He sticks to his views with perseverance.\\"\\"Requisitoir in de strafzaak tegen Mohammed B\\", (\\"Indictment of the criminal case against Mohammed B\\"). (Waybacked). On 26 July 2005, Bouyeri was sentenced to life in prison, which is the most severe punishment under Dutch law. Unlike other countries in Europe, life imprisonment carries no chance of parole in the Netherlands. A release is technically possible via a pardon by the reigning monarch, but this is extremely rare; only a few of these pardons have ever been successful in recent history. Other than war criminals, Bouyeri is only the 28th person to receive this punishment since 1945, and the only person to receive a life sentence for a single murder without aggravating circumstances. Life sentences were seen only with multiple-homicide cases, but the Wet terroristische misdrijven (Terrorist Crimes Law) that went into effect on 10 August 2004 extended it to leaders of terrorist organisations. Imprisonments ordinarily in excess of 15 years can be upgraded to life imprisonment, as was the case with Bouyeri. Bouyeri is held in the EBI (Supermax) facility within Nieuw Vosseveld prison. In popular culture * South African artist Marlene Dumas drew a portrait of Bouyeri in 2005 that has been displayed in the Stedelijk Museum. * Leon de Winter's bestselling 2012 novel Acts of Kindness features Bouyeri and van Gogh as characters. * Journalist Theodor Holman, one of van Gogh's best friends, wrote a film in 2014 called 2/11 ‚Äì Het Spel van de Wolf (a reference to the date van Gogh was killed, November 2; \\"The Game of the Wolf\\") that \\"posits a far- fetched theory that the CIA was in a way responsible for the murder by pressuring the Dutch secret service not to arrest Mr. Bouyeri‚Äîwhom Dutch authorities had been monitoring‚Äîto use him to get to a bigger fish with ties to Al Qaeda\\". The film premiered at the Netherlands Film Festival in October 2014 and played on national television on November 2, 2014. The title alludes to Van Gogh's movie 06/05, in which it's implied that Pim Fortuyn's murder was facilitated by the Dutch secret service agency.

It is depicted as a mythical creature with a lion's head and the body of a fish. Being of prominent symbolic nature to Singapore and Singaporeans in general, it is widely used to represent both the country and its people in sports teams, advertising, branding, tourism and as a national personification and patriotic emblem of the Singaporean nation. The Merlion was first used in Singapore as the logo for the tourism board. Its name combines \\"mer\\", meaning the sea, and \\"lion\\". The fish body represents Singapore's origin as a fishing village when it was called Temasek, which means \\"Sea Town\\" in Javanese. The lion head represents Singapore's original name‚ÄîSingapura‚Äîmeaning \\"Lion City\\". The symbol was designed by Alec Fraser-Brunner, a member of the Souvenir Committee and curator of the Van Kleef Aquarium, for the logo of the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) which was in use from 1964 to 1997, and has been a trademarked symbol since 1966. Although the STB has since changed their logo in 1997, the STB Act continues to protect the Merlion symbol. Approval must be received from STB before it can be used. The Merlion appears frequently on STB-approved souvenirs.  Original location  Merlion at its original location on the mouth of the Singapore River in 1994 On 15 September 1972, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew officiated the installation ceremony of the Merlion statue. The original Merlion statue used to stand at the mouth of the Singapore River, at the tip of the Former Merlion Park with Anderson Bridge as its background. It was conceptualised by the vice-chancellor of the University of Singapore (now known as National University of Singapore) then, Kwan Sai Kheong. Made from November 1971 to August 1972 by the late Singapore sculptor, Lim Nang Seng (), it measures 8.6 metres high and weighs 70 tons.Merlion Restaurant and Bar The project cost about S$165,000.  Relocation of original statue  The Merlion seen from its back with a view at the three towers of the Marina Bay Sands The completion of the Esplanade Bridge, in 1997, blocked the views of the Merlion from the Marina Bay waterfront. By then, the original Merlion location was also no longer the entrance of Singapore River. So, in 2002, the statue and its cub were relocated 120 metres to the current Merlion Park that fronts Marina Bay where it stands on a newly reclaimed promontory in front of The Fullerton Hotel. Another solution considered‚Äîto raise the Merlion on a pedestal at its original location‚Äîwas deemed unsuitable as the view would still be blocked by the bridge. Other possible relocation sites considered included Nicoll Highway Extension Bridge, Esplanade Park, Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay, a promontory at Marina Centre (near where Singapore Flyer is located now), a promontory site at Bayfront (near the tip of Marina Bay Sands integrated resort) and Kim Seng Park. However, all were either unsuitable or not technically feasible. The unprecedented feat of relocation began on 23 April 2002, and finished on 25 April. A carefully engineered journey required one barge, two DEMAG AC1600S cranes of 5000 tonnes lifting capacity, plus a team of 20 engineers and workers on site. The entire statue was hoisted onto the barge, which then sailed to the new installation site at the current Merlion Park, near the mouth of Singapore River. During the voyage, the statue had to be hoisted from the barge, over the Esplanade Bridge and then back onto the barge, as it was too tall to pass underneath. Exactly 30 years after it was officially launched, then-Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew returned on 15 September 2002 to ceremonially welcome the Merlion again ‚Äì this time in its new home. A viewing deck now stretches over the Singapore River, allowing visitors to pose for a photograph with a front or side view of the Merlion, including a new city skyline backdrop in the picture. The sculpture was aligned to face East, a direction advised to be most auspicious. Relocated, the statue once more spouted water from its mouth, having stopped in its old location since 1998 due to a water pump malfunction. The Merlion now has a new two-unit water pump system with units working alternatively, so a partner is always on standby. The relocation and new site (four times larger than the original) cost S$7.5 million.  Maintenance of original statue  From 5 June till 10 July 2006, the Merlion at Merlion Park underwent maintenance. The last one was right after its relocation. Dirt and stains were removed using high-pressure water streams, and various wear and tear of the statue was mended. During that period, visitors were greeted with illustrated hoardings and canvases covering the safety nets and scaffolding. The illustrationsMiel's illustrations were designed by Miel, an award-winning senior artist at The Straits Times. The illustration on the canvases made them look like shower curtains, with the Merlion sticking its head out with the shadow of its tail behind the curtain. The illustration on the hoardings showed the Merlion scrubbing himself with a brush and showering using a Merlion shower head spouting water. The Merlion said \\"EXCUSE ME while i take a shower...\\" in a speech bubble. The Merlion on Sentosa was designed and sculpted by an Australian Artist named James Martin. It is made of Glass Reinforced Cement (GRC) over a steel armature that is attached to the centre. The Merlion Park was temporarily turned into a single- unit hotel suite, as part of an artwork by Tatzu Nishi, for the duration of the 2011 Singapore Biennale.  Damage by lightning  On Saturday, 28 February 2009, at about 4:26 pm, the Merlion in the Merlion Park was struck by lightning. A breaking news from 938NOW local radio showed an image with fragments from the Merlion's head on the ground. Examination of the damage was done quickly with wooden scaffolding set up on Sunday, 1 March 2009 for workers to take a closer look at the hole. The incident happened as a result of the lack of lightning protection on the Merlion itself.Lightning strikes Merlion Merlion statues The Merlion on Sentosa (already disassembled) Mini Merlion The Merlion on Mount Faber The Merlion Tourism Court Within Singapore, there are six Merlion statues in Singapore which are approved by the STB. * The 8.6-metre-tall original statue at Merlion Park * The smaller two-metre- tall statue standing behind the original statue, weighed 3 ton and was commonly referred to as the ‚ÄúMerlion cub‚Äù. It was inlaid with Chinese porcelain plates and bowls as part of its design. * The three-metre-tall glazed polymarble statue at Tourism Court (near Grange Road) completed in 1995 * The three-metre-tall polymarble statue placed on Mount Faber's Faber Point *A pair of Merlion statues were constructed by the Ang Mo Kio Residential Committee in 1999. Those sit at the entrance of the car park along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1. One of the previously approved statues, a 37-metre-tall gigantic replica at Sentosa, with Mouth Gallery Viewing Deck on the ninth storey, another viewing gallery on its head and Sentosa Merlion Shop, and capable of shining laser beams from its eyes, was closed on 20 October 2019. The area around the statue would be replaced by a Sentosa Sensoryscape project targeted to be completed by 2022. The statues can also be found outside of Singapore in various countries, namely Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, and Thailand.

Due to Thumboo's status as Singapore's unofficial poet laureate and the nationalistic mythmaking qualities of his poetry, future generations of Singaporean poets have struggled with the symbol of the Merlion, frequently taking an ironical, critical, or even hostile stand ‚Äì and pointing out its artificiality and the refusal of ordinary Singaporeans to accept a tourist attraction as their national icon. The poem \\"attracted considerable attention among subsequent poets, who have all felt obliged to write their own Merlion (or anti-Merlion) poems, illustrating their anxiety of influence, as well as the continuing local fascination with the dialectic between a public and a private role for poets, which Thumboo (as Yeats before him, in the Irish context) has wanted to sustain as a fruitful rather than a tense relation between the personal and the public.\\" Among the poems of this nature are \\"Merlign\\" by Alvin Pang and \\"Love Song for a Merlion\\" by Vernon Chan. More recent poems include \\"Merlion: Strike One\\" by Koh Buck Song in the 2009 anthology, Reflecting on the Merlion. * Merlions as a species were fictional characters in Gwee Li Sui's Myth of the Stone (1993), the first full-length graphic novel published in Singapore. They were depicted as calm and wise creatures that fought on the side of good and eventually overcame the dreaded Kraken. Gwee further popularised the iconoclastic image of the spitting Merlion in the early 1990s. It reappeared later with his well-loved poem \\"Propitiations\\" in his book of poems Who Wants to Buy a Book of Poems? (1998). =As mascots and performance characters= * For the inaugural Singapore 2010 Summer Youth Olympics, a pair of mascots, Lyo and Merly, were introduced.

Unlike the actual merlion, she has hands and legs instead of a tailfin. * The 37m-tall Sentosa Merlion appeared in the Magical Sentosa show, awakening at the last scene of the show and shining two laser beams out of its eyes at the audience. (Similar to the storyline of the Songs of the Sea show.) * The popular Instagram plushie MerRyan is a merlion. =In local parlance= * Singaporeans often substitute the term \\"Merlion\\" in lieu of vomiting, in reference of the constant gushing of water from the Merlion's mouth. It is now used by Singaporean medical staff as slang for a patient who has intractable vomiting. =In sculpture= * A small Merlion, complete with a plaque giving information about the original statues, forms part of the decoration in the \\"Mystic East\\" area of British theme park Chessington World of Adventures. * The Merlion was featured‚Äì or, depending on point of view, not featured‚Äì during the 2005 Venice Biennale in the controversial work Mike by artist Lim Tzay Chuen.

He was director of the Roslin Institute from 2002-2004. His PhD was on Satellite DNA at the Medical Research Council Unit, in Edinburgh. From there he joined John Bishop‚Äôs team at the Institute of Genetics, at the University of Edinburgh, where he carried out research into the genes in the liver of mice. In 1985 he was appointed to the Animal Breeding Research Organisation (subsequently the Roslin Institute) where he began work in genetic modification to produce a sheep giving milk with human proteins. He was successful within five years. Tracy, born in 1990, was the first sheep to produce large quantities of human protein, making 35g of the alpha-1-antitrypsin (used in treatment of cystic fibrosis) in each litre of her milk. During the 1990s, Clark continued to develop transgenic techniques on large animals. With his colleagues, he produced a sheep from which a prion protein gene had been removed, the first time this had been achieved in a large animal. Clark's work set the stage for Ian Wilmut's team at Roslin to clone a sheep, Dolly (1996), the result of transplanted DNA of an adult sheep to an unfertilized egg cell. He was appointed an OBE in 1997 for his contribution to Science. Personal history Born in Blackpool, his family moved to Lincolnshire and he was educated at Barton Grammar School. He met Helen Banfield at Cambridge in 1973, where he graduated in natural sciences from Christ's College, Cambridge, a constituent college of the University of Cambridge. They married in 1975 in Canada and moved to Edinburgh in 1977 where he took his doctorate. They had two sons, Charlie (1989), and Laurie (1991). One of his greatest pleasures was spending time with his family on the remote Isle of Colonsay, in the Inner Hebrides. He was respected by colleagues for his leadership, direction and the support he gave them. Clark died at the age of 52, suffering from depression. He was found hanged. in his holiday home.

The wife of main character Leopold Bloom, she roughly corresponds to Penelope in the Odyssey. The major difference between Molly and Penelope is that while Penelope is eternally faithful, Molly is not. Molly is having an affair with Hugh 'Blazes' Boylan. Molly, whose given name is Marion, was born in Gibraltar on 8 September 1870, the daughter of Major Tweedy, an Irish military officer, and Lunita Laredo, a Gibraltarian of Spanish descent. Molly and Leopold were married on 8 October 1888. She is the mother of Milly Bloom, who, at the age of 15, has left home to study photography. She is also the mother of Rudy Bloom, who died at the age of 11 days. In Dublin, Molly is an opera singer of some renown. The final chapter of Ulysses, often called \\"Molly Bloom's Soliloquy\\", is a long and unpunctuated stream of consciousness passage comprising her thoughts as she lies in bed next to Bloom. Soliloquy Molly Bloom's soliloquy is the eighteenth and final \\"episode\\" of Ulysses, in which the thoughts of Molly Bloom are presented in contrast to those of the previous narrators, Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus. Molly's physicality is often contrasted with the intellectualism of the male characters, Stephen Dedalus in particular. Joyce's novel presented the action with numbered \\"episodes\\" rather than named chapters. Most critics since Stuart Gilbert, in his James Joyce's Ulysses, have named the episodes and they are often called chapters. The final chapter is referred to as \\"Penelope\\", after Molly's mythical counterpart. In the course of the monologue, Molly accepts Leopold into her bed, frets about his health, and then reminisces about their first meeting and about when she knew she was in love with him. The final words of Molly's reverie, and the very last words of the book, are: Joyce noted in a 1921 letter to Frank Budgen that \\"[t]he last word (human, all too human) is left to Penelope.\\" The episode both begins and ends with \\"yes\\", a word that Joyce described as \\"the female word\\" and that he said indicated \\"acquiescence, self-abandon, relaxation, the end of all resistance.\\" This last, clear \\"yes\\" stands in sharp contrast to her unintelligible first spoken line in the fourth chapter of the novel. Molly's soliloquy consists of eight enormous \\"sentences\\", The concluding period following the final words of her reverie is one of only two punctuation marks in the chapter, the periods at the end of the fourth and eighth \\"sentences\\". When written this episode contained the longest \\"sentence\\" in English literature, 4,391 words expressed by Molly Bloom (it was surpassed in 2001 by Jonathan Coe's The Rotters' Club). Sources Joyce modelled the character upon his wife, Nora Barnacle; indeed, the day upon which the novel is set ‚Äî June 16, 1904, now called Bloomsday ‚Äî is that of their first date. Nora Barnacle's letters also almost entirely lacked capitalization or punctuation; Anthony Burgess has said that \\"sometimes it is hard to distinguish between a chunk of one of Nora's letters and a chunk of Molly's final monologue\\". Some research also points to another possible model for Molly in Amalia Popper, one of Joyce's students to whom he taught English while living in Trieste. Amalia Popper was the daughter of a Jewish businessman named Leopoldo Popper, who had worked for a European freight forwarding company (Adolf Blum & Popper) founded in 1875 in its headquarters in Hamburg by Adolf Blum, after whom Leopold Bloom was named. In the (now published) manuscript Giacomo Joyce, are images and themes Joyce used in Ulysses and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Cultural references * J.M. Coetzee's novel Elizabeth Costello portrays the fictional writer Costello as the author of a fictional novel, The House on Eccles Street, which is written from Molly Bloom's point of view. * It was the inspiration for the Kate Bush song \\"The Sensual World\\". Bush had originally written the song to directly quote Ulysses, but Joyce's estate refused permission. Thus she wrote her own set of lyrics in a style that echoed Molly Bloom's soliloquy. Bush's 2011 album Director's Cut includes a newer version of the track (\\"Flower of the Mountain\\") with new vocals that use the original Joyce text. * Molly Bloom's soliloquy was used as the basis for a dance song by Amber, titled \\"Yes.\\" * The soliloquy is featured in a Rodney Dangerfield movie, Back to School, wherein it is read aloud to a college English class by Dr. Diane Turner (played by Sally Kellerman). * There is a bronze sculpture of Molly Bloom which stands at the Alameda Gardens in Gibraltar. This running figure was commissioned from Jon Searle to celebrate the bicentenary of the Gibraltar Chronicle in 2001. * Part of the soliloquy is quoted by the character Molly Greaney in the Susan Turlish play Lafferty's Wake. * The character Ralph Spoilsport recites the end of the soliloquy, with erratic variations in gender pronouns, as the last lines of the Firesign Theatre's album How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You're Not Anywhere at All. * \\"Yes I Said Yes I Will Yes\\", inspired by the soliloquy, is the title of a track by Bristol-based jazz quartet Get the Blessing, appearing on their album Bugs in Amber. * In the final pages of his novel The Republic of Wine, Chinese author and winner of the 2012 Nobel Prize for Literature Mo Yan concludes the book with what could be seen as an homage to Ulysses's Molly Bloom soliloquy. * Stephen Colbert's parody of Donald Trump's announcement for his presidential candidacy, entitled \\"Announcing: an Announcement,\\" recites part of the soliloquy in an otherwise random series of statements. * Tom Paxton's album \\"6\\" contains a song titled \\"Molly Bloom\\" References Further reading * The Chronicle of Leopold and Molly Bloom: Ulysses as Narrative full preview on Google Books * Blamires, Harry (1988).

In Nyishi, their traditional language, Nyi refers to \\"a human\\" and the word shi denotes \\"a being\\", which combined together refers to a human being. They are spread across eight districts of Arunachal Pradesh: Kra Daadi, Kurung Kumey, East Kameng, West Kameng, Papum Pare, parts of Lower Subansiri, Kamle and Pakke Kesang district. The most populous being the Akang and Leil community of Papum Pare districts. They also live in the Sonitpur and North Lakhimpur districts of Assam. Their population of around 300,000 makes them the most populous tribe of Arunachal Pradesh, closely followed by the tribes of the Adi according to 2001 census. The Nyishi language belongs to the Sino-Tibetan family, however, the origin is disputed. Polygyny is prevalent among the Nyishi. It signifies one's social status and economical stability and also proves handy during hard times like clan wars or social huntings and various other social activities. This practice, however is diminishing especially with the modernization and also with the spread of Christianity. They trace their descent patrilineally and are divided into several clans.  Economy  The Nyishi are agriculturalists who practice jhum, known as r√´t rung-o in Nishi, which is a form of shifting cultivation. The principal crops raised include paddy (rice), top (maize), mekung (cucumber), tak-yi (ginger), aeng (yams) and temi (millet). Rice is the staple food of the people, supplemented by fish, meat of various animals, edible tubers and leafy vegetables. Before a Western market economic system arrived, they used a barter system. They greatly valued the generalized reciprocity and also balance reciprocity in their economic system. A locally-made drink known as upo (the two types of upo: pone, made of rice, and polin which is made of millet) is served at every social gatherings and important events. The Nyishis are typically fond of it. Traditional ways of preparing them include fermentation, steaming, roasting and smoking. Recently they have been forced to move towards a market based exchange economy.  Attire  Traditionally, Nyishi plaited their hair and tie it neatly at the forehead with locally-made thread. A brass skewer passes horizontally through the tied hair. Cane rings were worn around the waist, arms and legs. Men wore a cane helmet surmounted with the beak of the great Indian hornbill. The usage of actual hornbill beaks is discouraged these days due to tough wildlife protection laws since the great Indian hornbill is a protected species and generally due to growing awareness among the people as well. Nowadays It is being supplemented by beaks made of cane or other materials and the entire headgear/cane helmet itself is readily available in the market for purchase. Additional decorations varied depending upon the status of the person and were symbols of manly valor. The clothing of the men consists of two types of sleeveless shirts(letum) and with black and white stripe (pomo) made from thick cotton cloth, striped gaily with blue and red together with a mantle of cotton or wool fastened around the throat and shoulders. Strings made of beads in varying sizes and colours are also worn, mainly for decoration purposes and to show the wearer's status. They also carry a machete or dao (uryu) in Nyishi) (short sword) and a knife (chighi) in a bamboo sheath that are mostly covered with animal furs. Their armament consists of a spear with an iron head, a large sword (uryu), and a bow and arrows which are tipped with poison (um-yu). During war, both the chest and back are covered with shields made from sabbe buffalo hide, and over it they wear a black cloak made of indigenous fibre. The Nyishi women generally wear a sleeveless mantle of striped or plain cloth, its upper part tucked tightly over the breast and enveloping the body from the armpits to the centre of the calves addition with different colour tops worn underneath among which red (jwle / jwlang) is generally used . A ribbon is tied at the waist. A girdle consisting of metal disks, beads, and cane garters is worn at the waist. Their hair is parted in the middle, plaited and tied into a chignon just above the nape. Their ornaments include multicolored bead necklaces, brass chains, metal bells, huge brass or silver earrings and heavy bracelets of various metals.  Religion  A festival of the Nyishi tribe of Arunachal Pradesh, India.Nyokum is the festival celebrated by the Nyishi people, which commemorates their ancestors. Christian missionaries began opperating in Arunachal Pradesh in the 1950s; however, many of their proselytising activities were limited by the government until the 1970s. According to a 2011 survey, many of the Nyishi people have become Christian (31%), followed by Hinduism (29%), with many of the remaining still following the ancient indigenous Donyi-Poloism.  The hornbill issue  The Nyishis, who traditionally wear cane helmets surmounted by the crest of a hornbill beak (known as pudum or padam), have considerably affected the population of this bird. Several organizations, such as the Arunachal Wildlife and Nature Foundation and the Wildlife Trust of India, have been trying to stop the Nyishi hunting these birds in order to protect them from extinction. Nature reserves, such as the Pakke Sanctuary, are being set up to protect the birds, while artificial materials, such as fiberglass, have been introduced as an alternative to the hornbill beak in Nyishi dress.

In February 2018, Harker finished construction on their new performing arts building on the Saratoga campus, which includes a 463-seat theater, dressing rooms and practice rooms, and a Bosendorfer 214VC CS grand piano. Publications Harker has a school newspaper (Winged Post), yearbook (Talon), news website (Harker Aquila, formerly talonwp.com), and news magazine (Wingspan), as well as a social media presence. Harker also has a science research magazine, Harker Horizon, which has an online presence and printed its inaugural issue in 2017.In addition, Harker began an economics magazine, Equilibrium, in 2019, and will maintain both an online presence and print its inaugural version in Summer 2020. The school's art and literature magazine, HELM, has published 17 print issues as of late 2017. = Middle school = The middle school is located on the Blackford campus, the former site of Blackford High School. The site has been rented since the 2005‚Äì06 school year. Before 1998, grade 8 was the final year at Harker, and middle school graduates matriculated to private and public high schools in the Bay Area. Since the opening of the upper school in 1998, most students choose to remain at Harker School after middle school. Many components ease the shift from the lower school to the middle school, including various athletic and artistic programs. There is also a fine arts requirement: students in grades 7 and 8 must take at least one arts class or participate in one art event in order to graduate (sixth graders are encouraged to do so, as well). = Lower school = The elementary school is located on the Bucknall campus, the former site of Bucknall Elementary School. The campus was sold to Harker School by the Moreland School District, and classes started there in the 1998‚Äì99 school year. The lower school also has an after-school orchestra, as well as sports and other activities.  Conservation  In December 2014, Harker School received a commendation from the City of San Jose for more than quadrupling recycling on campus, from 15 percent to almost 70 percent of materials, since 2012.  Tuition  Harker School's tuition is significantly higher than most comparable private schools in the Bay Area.

It typically consists of a face fabric with nonwoven or foam backing. Headliners consist of multilayered composite materials that bring together multiple functionalities, including the requested look, feel, stiffness, and sound reduction needed in cars. Automotive headliners are optimised with respect to head impact counter measuresHeholt, Susan. Daimler Chrysler, USP 7014259 (B2) or to integrate additional LED lighting film behind the fabric. Most headliners consist of a tricot knit fabric that is napped to provide a soft touch and uniform appearance. The fabric is adhered to melted polyurethane foam. This fabric-foam composite is glued to the interior fiberglass roof of the automobile. There are more complex knit products used as a face fabric, as well as less expensive non-woven products. Recent headliner developments include environmentally friendly products made of recyclable backing-adhesive and face fabrics. In yachts, foam-backed vinyl is often used. Replacements When a headliner fails, it sags or falls from the roof. One can use upholstery twist pins (a flat-headed corkscrew-like pin) to effect a temporary repair, but repairs usually involve tacking or replacing the entire headliner. Heat, humidity, and time rapidly degrade the bond that the polyurethane foam has with the face fabric. As the foam oxidizes and yellows, the fabric-foam bond fails. This failure is more common in cars produced in the 1970s. Replacing the entire headliner fabric is usually necessary as the oxidized foam can prove nearly impossible to remove from the sagging fabric. In order to do this, a headliner replacement kit, some headliner adhesive, and a scrub brush are needed. The general process as outlined by most repair guides is as follows: # Carefully remove the current headliner board. # Peel off the old headliner fabric. # Brush off the old adhesive foam from the headliner board. # Glue the new headliner fabric and reinstall back into the vehicle. This de-bonding can happen to similar vinyl headlining in boats, but with less predictability.

Greenleaf offered for the establishment of a park to be named Forest Park. Shortly after, approximately were donated by wealthy philanthropist Everett Hosmer Barney. Barney made his fortune as a Civil War arms producer and later as a businessman, inventing clamp-on ice skates and rollerskates.http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMCXHT_Forest_Park_Springfield_MAhttp://www.barneycarriagehouse.com/bch/ Everett Hosmer Barney In 1890 Barney built an elaborate, turreted -story Victorian mansion on a hill at the west end of his estate, which featured a spectacular view of the Connecticut River and Metro Center Springfield. The mansion's elaborate carriage house still stands, today serving as a restaurant and banquet hall in Forest Park.http://www.barneycarriagehouse.com/bch/http://www.barneycarriagehouse.com/bch/ To create the parcel of land on which Forest Park was built, Greenleaf and Barney convinced several of their wealthy friends and neighbors to donate much of the remaining land that would ultimately make-up the 735-acre Forest Park. They both became members of the Board of Park Commissioners, which also listed John Olmsted (resigned on March 1, 1886).Park Commissioners' Report: Springfield, Massachusetts, Springfield (Mass.): Board of Park Commissioners, 1894. At the time, much of this land was located in the neighboring suburb of Longmeadow, Massachusetts, (which had separated from Springfield nearly a century before the construction of Forest Park.) Ultimately, Longmeadow ceded complete control of Forest Park to the City of Springfield. In October 2017, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker announced that the state would assume the $3 million costs to repair a culvert at the main entrance of the park. Interstate 91 The Barney Mansion was used for Forest Park events until the mid-1950s, when about of the park, including of the former Barney estate, were taken to construct the Springfield/Longmeadow sections of Interstate 91. Barney's house stood atop the hill at the northwest corner of the park, and the highway construction may have threatened its foundations; anticipating that, it was razed. Ultimately, the construction of I-91 severed the Forest Park's connection to the Connecticut River. The Barney Mansion's stained glass windows were moved to a house in Palmer, Massachusetts where the demolition contractor lived at the time. The mausoleum of Barney's son and a carriage house still survive from the estate, along with many remnants of an extensive arboretum and water gardens planted by Barney around 1900. The developer of the Forest Park neighborhood continued this theme by planting many interesting specimen trees, especially around Magnolia Terrace. This historic neighborhood with many fine examples of Victorian houses abuts the park on the north, while a small enclave of Springfield's stately brick colonial homes and the town of Longmeadow, Massachusetts borders the park to the south. Attractions Among the Forest Park's notable year-round attractions are the Forest Park Zoo, which features large cats, monkeys, birds, and a number of other \\"exotic and indigenous animals\\";http://www.forestparkzoo.org/about/ several playgrounds; Porter Lake; an ice hockey and ice-skating rink, Cyr Arena; several baseball diamonds and a grandstand; a rose garden; a bocce court; a lawn bowling court; basketball and tennis courts; an aquatic garden (in the Asian style); numerous promenades; a beach volleyball court; several wooded groves; picnic areas; America's first public swimming pool (1899); ponds with various waterfowl; an exhibit of ancient dinosaur tracks, and an eternal flame that burns 24 hours a day honoring President John F. Kennedy. The ruggedly contoured valley of Pecousic Brook occupies more than half of the south side of the Forest Park. This area has been left largely Naturalist in style, although it features many walking trails and a few elegant bridges. It is home to many species of birds and wildlife. The statue at the Route 5 entrance to Forest Park was created by Peter Wolf Toth and is part of the Trail of the Whispering Giants. The statue represents Omiskanoagwiak. A statue of a golden retriever, Stone Dog II, currently stands between the park's largest playground and the zoo. The statue is a near replica of an older statue (known by Springfield natives and park patrons as Stone Dog), which went missing from the park in 1987. The original Stone Dog dates back to the late 19th century. Since 1970, the Environmental Center for Our Schools (or ECOS, as it is commonly called) takes all Springfield public school students in grades four through seven on a two-day environmental learning outing in Forest Park. The headquarters of this organization is located in Forest Park.Environmental Center for Our Schools: Introduction to ECOS for Parents. Emfoley.com (2008-09-02). Retrieved on 2013-08-02.

Some of the special needs populations the camp has worked with include: developmental delays, ADD/ADHD, emotional problems, learning disabilities, and visual and hearing impairments. Camp STAR/Angelina is a 6-week summer program. The camp is located on the outskirts of Forest Park off Trafton Road and activities include swimming, sports, games, crafts, field trips and an end of camp variety show. Bright Nights Bright Nights at Forest Park is a national attraction during the Christmas and Chanukah seasons. Bright Nights is a lighting spectacle that features time and color coordinated lighting exhibits. Trees and sculptures are decorated to look like various scenes and characters, including many from the works of Springfield native Dr. Seuss. Many scenes are animated; others are simply decorative. One of the spectacles' most elaborate exhibits is a replica of Everett Barney's mansion. Viewers in automobiles queue up to drive for approximately 2 miles along a meandering path through the park to see the displays. Each year Bright Nights changes and becomes more elaborate.

In the , Herston had a population of 2,215 people. Geography Herston is located by car north of the Brisbane CBD. The area of Herston includes the Herston Health Precinct on its eastern side. This includes the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, the Queensland Institute of Medical Research and the Herston Quarter which is a development site to replace the former Royal Children's Hospital which moved to another site in 2014. Herston also includes the Ballymore Stadium Rugby Union venue in the northwest and Victoria Park on the southern side of Herston Road. The park includes the Victoria Park golf course and the heritage-listed former Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse built in 1931. The rest of Herston is mostly a residential suburb, with some areas of light industry near the main roads. Many of Herston's residents are employed by the hospital or nearby at the Queensland University of Technology in Kelvin Grove. There is also a significant student population that studies at the university. The Herston Quarter is a development site in Herston adjacent to the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital on the site of the former Royal Children's Hospital which was merged into the Queensland Children's Hospital in South Brisbane. The site includes the restoration of the historic Royal Brisbane Hospital Nurses' Homes. History Robert Herbert View of Bowen Bridge Road from the corner of O'Connell Terrace in 1869 Herston was first settled by Europeans in the 1850s. Sir Robert Herbert, Queensland's first premier, built a farm in the area, and lived in the farmhouse with his then Attorney-General, John Bramston. The pair named their house Herston, a combination of their surnames, which eventually became the name of the suburb. Many of Herston's streets were named after local identities of the time. Bowen Bridge Road and Bowen Park were named after Sir George Bowen, Queensland's first governor. Butterfield Street was named after local schoolmaster William Butterfield. Hetherington Street was named after coal industry identity John William Hetherington, and Garrick Terrace got its name from James Francis Garrick, the man who purchased Herston from Herbert and Bramston. Royal Childrens Hospital Special School opened on 11 August 1919. As the name suggests, the school provided education to children who were patients in the hospital. On 1 December 2014 it became the Royal Brisbane and ACT for Kids Campus of the Lady Cilento Children's Hospital School. On 1 January 2019 it became a campus of the Queensland Children's Hospital School (reflecting the name change of the Lady Cilento Children's Hospital). St Joan of Arc Catholic church opened on Sunday 5 December 1920 when it was blessed and opened by Roman Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane, James Duhig. St Joan of Arc Catholic School opened on 14 July 1924 under the Sisters of the Presentation. The school closed in 1968. From the eastern side of the suburb was served by frequent tram services along Bowen Bridge Road, with routes converging from Chermside, Kalinga (until 1962), Stafford, and Grange. These services combined to provide the suburb with an off-peak service of a tram every 2¬Ω minutes along Bowen Bridge Road in the late 1950s. This service ceased in December 1968. From the western side of the suburb was served by trams which ran along Kelvin Grove Road. This service also ceased in December 1968. Herston Methodist Church opened on Saturday 24 March 1923 on the corner of Aberleigh and Scott Roads (). It was an unpretentious hardwood building . The church was still operating in 1990 but had closed prior to March 2020. On 13 October 1928 St Luke's Anglican Mission Hall was dedicated by Archbishop Gerald Sharp. Although Herston was within the parish of Holy Trinity Church at Fortitude Valley, Herston residents had wanted a closer place of worship. The mission hall was in a converted residence with the front rooms being used as a chapel and a Sunday School. A new church was dedicated on 29 April 1962 by Archbishop Reginald Halse and consecrated on 18 October 1964 by Archbishop Philip Strong. Its closure in 7 May 1993 was approved by Assistant Bishop Wood. It was located on the corner of Wyndham and Weightman Streets (). Between 1953 and November 1968, the suburb was also served by Brisbane City Council trolley- buses which connected the suburb with Fortitude Valley and ran through to Stanley Bridge in East Brisbane. The trolley-buses ran along Herston Road and Butterfield Street, past Ballymore football ground, terminating near the intersection of Prospect Terrace and Kelvin Grove Road. Wattlebrae Hospital School opened on circa 1957 and closed on circa 1958.Royal Children's Hospital, Herston, November 2014 In 2009, a decision was made to merge the Royal Children's Hospital with Mater Children's Hospital in Stanley Street, South Brisbane to create a single children's hospital in Brisbane. The decision was very controversial with many people opposed to the merger, while others supported the merge but argued over location of the new hospital (some favouring the Herston site and other favouring the South Brisbane site). The Queensland Children's Hospital opened on 29 November 2014, adjacent to the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, in South Brisbane, with the Royal Children's Hospital and the Mater Children's Hospital closing immediately as their patients were transferred to the Queensland Children's Hospital. In November 2014, the Queensland Government sought applications from developers to develop the site into a mixed-use precinct which would complement the adjacent health and educational facilities. Three lead developers were short-listed in July 2015. On 1 October 2015, the government issued a call for detailed proposals from the two remaining shortlisted parties to develop the site, Stockland having withdrawn. The remaining proponents were Frasers Property Australia with Australian Unity and Lend Lease with Trinity Health. On 9 December 2015, the government announced that part of the development would include a government-funded Specialist Rehabilitation and Ambulatory Care Centre (SRACC) with 100 rehabilitation beds and 32 day surgery beds with seven operating theatres and three endoscopy rooms. The project to redevelop the Herston Quarter site is expected to cost the Queensland Government over ten years to develop a mixed health, aged care, residential and retail precinct. On 14 August 2016, Premier of Queensland, Annastacia Palaszczuk announced that Australian Unity had won the tender for the redevelopment, and there were expected to be 700 construction jobs and 1000 ongoing jobs on the site. It was announced to include a 132-bed specialist rehabilitation and ambulatory care centre for burns, stroke and other recovering patients. Further stages will have a private hospital for day-surgery, a residential aged-care home for over 100 people, research facilities, accommodation for 250 medical students, nurses scientists and visiting experts. The development will be overseen by the Metro North Hospital and Health Service. In the , Herston had a population of 2,215 people. On 25 August 2016, HASSELL was announced as the design partner for the Herston Quarter project. Watpac was announced as the builder. The Herston Quarter was declared a \\"Priority Development Area\\" (PDA) on 18 November 2016 by the Queensland Government under the Economic Development Act 2012. The declaration of a PDA removes the affected land from the planning and development processes of both the Sustainable Planning Act 2009 and Brisbane City Plan 2014. The PDA is managed by Economic Development Queensland within the Department of Infrastructure, Local Government and Planning. In addition, an Interim Land Use Plan was prepared to fast-track the development of a Specialist Rehabilitation and Ambulatory Care Centre. On 6 July 2017 the PDS (Proposed Development Scheme) was released for consultation. On 6 August 2017, the State Government released development plans for the Herston Quarter project. Heritage listings Herston has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 40 Bowen Bridge Road: Brisbane General Hospital Precinct * Herston Road: Royal Brisbane Hospital Nurses' Homes * 288 Herston Road: University of Queensland Mayne Medical School * 309 Herston Road: former Victoria Park Golf Clubhouse Demographics In the , Herston recorded a population of 2,215 people. The median age of the Herston population was 29 years of age, 9 years below the Australian median. 50.4% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was China at 6.5%. 57.7% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin at 7.1%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 40.7% and Catholic 18.4%. Transport Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital busway station Brisbane City Council diesel buses serve the suburb. The Inner- Northern Busway runs through the south of the suburb, having been built to divert buses off congested major roads. It services the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital busway station.  Education  The Royal Brisbane and ACT for Kids Campus of the Queensland Children's Hospital School is located within the hospital precinct. However it is only for children who are in-patients of the hospitals. There are no other schools in Herston.

The UN General Assembly declared World Toilet Day an official UN day in 2013, after Singapore had tabled the resolution (its first resolution before the UN's General Assembly of 193 member states). Prior to that, World Toilet Day had been established unofficially by the World Toilet Organization (a Singapore-based NGO) in 2001. UN-Water is the official convener of World Toilet Day. UN-Water maintains the official World Toilet Day website and chooses a special theme for each year. In 2019 the theme is 'Leaving no one behind', which is the central theme of the Sustainable Development Goals. Themes in previous years include nature-based solutions, wastewater, toilets and jobs, and toilets and nutrition. World Toilet Day is marked by communications campaigns and other activities. Events are planned by UN entities, international organizations, local civil society organizations and volunteers to raise awareness and inspire action. Toilets are important because access to a safe functioning toilet has a positive impact on public health, human dignity, and personal safety, especially for women. Sanitation systems that do not safely treat excreta allow the spread of disease. Serious soil-transmitted diseases and waterborne diseases such as cholera, diarrhea, typhoid, dysentery and schistosomiasis can result.

In consultation with the UN-Water World Toilet Day Task Force, made up of UN-Water member organizations, UN-Water selects the theme based on that year's World Water Development Report and develops content for World Toilet Day communications campaigns. UN-Water manages the World Toilet Day website which promotes key issues and stories, provides communications and campaigns resources, and announces events and opportunities to participate. The overall World Toilet Day campaign mobilizes civil society, think tanks, non-governmental organizations, academics, corporations and the general public to participate in the associated social media and communications campaigns.

This is closely related to Sustainable Development Goal 6 which has a target to eliminate open defecation and ensure \\"everyone has access to sustainable sanitation services by 2030, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations‚Äù. *2018 ‚Äì Nature-based solutions (slogan: \\"When Nature calls\\")UN-Water (2018) World Water Development Report 2018: Nature-based Solutions for Water, Geneva, Switzerland * 2017 ‚Äì Wastewater * 2016 ‚Äì Toilets and jobsUN-Water (2016) World Water Development Report 2016: Water and jobs, Geneva, Switzerland * 2015 ‚Äì Toilets and nutrition * 2014 ‚Äì Equality and dignity * 2013 ‚Äì Tourism and water * 2012 ‚Äì \\"I give a shit, do you?\\" (slogan)  Examples of activities and events  = Launch of reports = Some organizations launch toilet-related (or sanitation-related) reports on World Toilet Day. For example: * The Toilet Board Coalition (2017) \\"Sanitation Economy\\" * Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor (WSUP) (2017) \\"Guide to strengthening the enabling environment for faecal sludge management\\" * The International Labour Office (ILO) (2016) \\"WASH@Work: self-training handbook * WHO, UNICEF and USAID (2015) \\"Improving Nutrition Outcomes with Better Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: Practical Solutions for Policies and Programmes\\" = Events = *2019: Planned events for World Toilet Day 2019 include for example a workshop in the USA entitled \\"Manure Management ‚Äì What Poop Can Teach Youth!\\", art installations in Ireland under the theme \\"Think Before You Flush\\", and a \\"Toilets for all Campaign in Rural areas\\" in Madhya Pradesh, India. *2018: Events for World Toilet Day in 2018 included diverse activities such as a 'hackathon' in Ghana to promote digital solutions, a seminar hosted by Engineers without Borders in Denmark, a screening and discussion of the Bollywood movie Toilet: Ek Prem Katha (in English - Toilet: A Love Story) in Canada, and a school drawing competition in India. * 2017: Members of the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA) used the momentum around World Toilet Day in 2017 to update Wikipedia articles on WASH-related topics. This contributed to public education about the sanitation crisis. The documentary \\"Follow the Flush,\\" released 19 November 2017, educated people about what happens beneath the streets of New York City after a person flushes a toilet in Manhattan. In the lead-up to World Toilet Day 2017, communities worldwide came together for sanitation-themed \\"Urgent Runs\\". More than 63 events were held in 42 countries. Events included fun runs, awareness walks, toilet cleaning programs, carnivals and even motorbike parades. Countries participating include: Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, China, Congo-Brazzaville, France, Gambia, Germany, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Italy, Kenya, Mongolia, Mozambique, Namibia, Netherlands, Pakistan, Philippines, Senegal, Tanzania, United States and Vietnam. Impacts = Social media impacts= The World Toilet Day campaign and related publications reach millions of people through social media, dedicated websites and other channels. Over 100 events in 40 countries were registered on the World Toilet Day website in both 2016 and in 2017. In 2017, the hashtag #WorldToiletDay had a maximum potential reach of over 750 million people on social media. In 2018, the maximum potential reach increased by 15%,compared to 2017; the online activity and authors also increased by 12% and 22% compared to 2017, respectively.  History  UN General Assembly in New York. On 19 November 2001, the NGO World Toilet Organization (WTO) was founded by Jack Sim, a philanthropist from Singapore. He subsequently declared 19 November as World Toilet Day. The name \\"World Toilet Day\\" and not \\"World Sanitation Day\\" was chosen for ease of public messaging, even though toilets are only the first stage of sanitation systems. World Toilet Day events and public awareness campaigns increase public awareness of the broader sanitation systems that include wastewater treatment, fecal sludge management, municipal solid waste management, stormwater management, hygiene, and handwashing. Also, the UN Sustainable Development Goals call for more than just toilets. Goal 6 calls for adequate sanitation, which includes the whole system for assuring that waste is safely processed. The WTO began pushing for global recognition for World Toilet Day and, in 2007, the Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA) began to actively support World Toilet Day, too.Gr√∂ber, K., McCreary, C., Kappauf, L., Panzerbieter, T., R√ºck, J. (2012). Public awareness raising and sanitation marketing ‚Äì Factsheet of Working Group 9b. Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA) Their efforts to raise attention for the sanitation crisis were bolstered in 2010 when the human right to water and sanitation was officially declared a human right by the UN. In 2013, a joint initiative between the Government of Singapore and the World Toilet Organization led to Singapore's first ever UN resolution, named \\"Sanitation for All\\". The resolution calls for collective action to end the world's sanitation crisis. World Toilet Day was declared an official UN day in 2013. That resolution was adopted by 122 countries at the 67th session of the UN General Assembly in New York.World Toilet Organisation: World Toilet Day. Retrieved 5 August 2015. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) replaced the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2016. On World Toilet Day on 19 November 2015, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged broad action to renew efforts to provide access to adequate sanitation for all. He reminded everyone of the \\"Call to Action on Sanitation\\" which was launched in 2013, and the aim to end open defecation by 2025. He also said: ‚ÄúBy many accounts, sanitation is the most-missed target of the Millennium Development Goals.\\" The UN Deputy Secretary-General, Jan Eliasson, was honored on World Toilet Day in 2016 in New York for his deep commitment to breaking the sanitation taboo. For example, he had delivered a video message to attendees of a WaterAid and Unilever joint event in the European Parliament on World Toilet Day 2014. In 2016, UN-Water supported ‚ÄúA Toast for Toilets‚Äù in New York with the United Nations Mission of Singapore. Background thumb Child defecating in a canal in the slum of Gege in the city of Ibadan, Nigeria Worldwide, 4.2 billion people live without \\"safely managed sanitation\\" and around 673 million people worldwide practise open defecation. Having to defecate in the open is especially difficult for women and girls. Women tend to resort to the cover of darkness to give them more privacy, but then risk being attacked when alone at night. It has been estimated that 58% of all cases of diarrhea worldwide in 2015 were caused by unsafe water, poor sanitation and poor hygiene practices, such as inadequate handwashing. This resulted in half a million children under the age of five dying from diarrhea per year. Providing sanitation has been estimated to lower the odds of children suffering diarrhea by 7‚Äì17%, and under-five mortality by 5‚Äì20%. The Human Right to Water and Sanitation was recognized as a human right by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly on 28 July 2010. Lack of access to sanitation (toilets) has an impact on public health, dignity, and safety. The spread of many diseases (e.g. soil- transmitted helminthiasis, diarrhea, schistosomiasis) and stunted growth in children is directly related to people being exposed to human feces because toilets are either not available or not used. Sustainable Development Goal 6 aims to provide sanitation for all.

The 82nd edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Kansas City Royals and the National League (NL) champion St. Louis Cardinals. The Royals upset the heavily favored Cardinals in seven games. The Series was popularly known as the \\"Show-Me Series\\" or the \\"I-70 Showdown Series,\\" as both cities are in the state of Missouri which is nicknamed the \\"Show Me State\\" and are connected by Interstate 70. The Cardinals won the NL East division by three games over the New York Mets, then defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers four games to two in the NL Championship Series. The Royals won the AL West division by one game over the California Angels, then defeated the Toronto Blue Jays four games to three in the AL Championship Series. The Cardinals were seeking to win their NL-leading 10th World Series title, while the Royals were seeking their first World Series title. The Royals were completing one of the most successful decades by any expansion team, with six division titles and two pennants from 1976 to 1985. This was the first World Series in which all games were played at night. Also, this was the first World Series to feature television commentator Tim McCarver, who called the games for ABC with Al Michaels and Jim Palmer. (Howard Cosell was originally scheduled to be in the booth with Michaels and Palmer, but was removed from his assignment just prior to Game 1 because of the controversy surrounding his book I Never Played the Game.) McCarver would go on to call a record 24 World Series telecasts with ABC, CBS and Fox. This was the second all-Missouri World Series; the first in was all-St. Louis series between the Cardinals and Browns (a decade later, they became the Baltimore Orioles). This was the second of four World Series played completely on artificial turf; the first was in and the others were in and . This is the most recent World Series in which the designated hitter was not used in an AL baseball park. From to 1985, the DH was used in all games in even-numbered years. In odd-numbered years, like this World Series, the pitchers from both were required to bat for themselves throughout the series, as in the National League. Beginning with the next World Series, the DH rule was used only at the AL representative's park. The 1985 World Series marked the fifth time in World Series history that a team came back from a three games to one deficit to win a championship, and the first in which that team lost the first two games of the series at home (in the following year's Series, the New York Mets won after losing the first two series games at home). Bret Saberhagen's victories in Games 3 and 7, allowing only a single run in both starts, earned him the World Series Most Valuable Player award. In their 17th season, the Royals won their first World Series title; their next appearance was 29 years later in against the San Francisco Giants, but lost in seven games. A year later, the Royals won their second title, over the New York Mets. Summary Matchups =Game 1= When Lonnie Smith led off for the Royals, he became the first player in MLB history to be traded from a team (the St. Louis Cardinals) during a season and play against that team in the World Series the same season. John Tudor scattered seven hits in innings for the Cards and won with relief help from Todd Worrell. The Royals struck first in the second on Steve Balboni's RBI single with runners on first and second, but the Cardinals tied it off of Danny Jackson in the third on Willie McGee's RBI groundout with runners on second and third. Next inning, Tito Landrum doubled with one out, then scored on late-season acquisition C√©sar Cede√±o's RBI double to give Jackson the loss despite Jackson throwing seven innings of two-run ball. The Cardinals padded their lead in the ninth off of Dan Quisenberry when Tom Herr singled to lead off and scored on Jack Clark's double.Kansas City Royals History: 1985 Team Opens World Series, Kings of Kauffman, Fansided, Nicholas Sullivan, 2017. This was the first Saturday night game in World Series history. The Series began on a Saturday from 1969 through 1976, and again from 1985 through 2006 (with the exception of 1990, which began on a Tuesday night). =Game 2= The Royals went up 2‚Äì0 in the fourth off of Danny Cox when Willie Wilson hit a leadoff single that was followed by back-to-back RBI doubles by George Brett and Frank White. However Charlie Leibrandt continued a history of tough luck in the postseason. The previous year, he had lost Game 3 of the 1984 ALCS, 1‚Äì0, to the Detroit Tigers when he pitched a three-hit complete game. He lost Game 4 in the 1985 ALCS in the ninth inning. And clinging to a two-run lead in the ninth, manager Dick Howser opted to not send in his relief ace Dan Quisenberry to close out the game. Leibrandt allowed a leadoff double to Willie McGee, then only one out from tying the series at one apiece when he allowed an RBI single to Jack Clark. After a double and walk loaded the bases, Terry Pendleton cleared them with a double and gave the Cardinals a 4‚Äì2 lead. Quisenberry came in and after he walked Darrell Porter he got out of the inning. Jeff Lahti earned a save with a scoreless bottom of the inning. The Cardinals' four run ninth would be the only inning in the series in which they scored more than one run. =Game 3= The Royals got back into the series by riding ace Bret Saberhagen to a 6‚Äì1 victory against twenty-game winner Joaqu√≠n And√∫jar. Saberhagen flashed messages on the television screen to his pregnant wife who was due to give birth any day. She eventually gave birth on October 26 (in Game 6). The Royals went up 2‚Äì0 in the fourth on Lonnie Smith's two-run double that scored Jim Sundberg and Buddy Biancalana, who had walked and singled, respectively. Royals second baseman Frank White made history by becoming the first second baseman in the history of the World Series to hit in the clean-up spot in the batting order. White came through with a two-run home run off of And√∫jar in the fifth after George Brett got on base. The Cardinals scored their only run of the game in the sixth off of Bret Saberhagen on consecutive singles by Ozzie Smith, Tom Herr, and Jack Clark. The Royals padded their lead in the seventh off of Ricky Horton when George Brett drew a leadoff walk, moved to second on a balk, then scored on White's double. Two outs later, White scored on Buddy Biancalana's single to cap the scoring. =Game 4= John Tudor's complete game shutout put the Cardinals on the verge of winning their second World Series in four years. Tito Landrum, only playing due to a tarp injury to Vince Coleman, continued to make his case for series MVP with a home run in the second off of Bud Black. Next inning, Willie McGee homered also to make it 2‚Äì0 Cardinals, who added to their lead in the fifth when Terry Pendleton tripled with one out and scored on Black's throwing error on Tom Nieto's bunt attempt. =Game 5= Entering this game, the Royals were 3‚Äì0 in must-win games in playoff elimination games. They improved their record to 4‚Äì0 with a decisive victory over the Cardinals, again by the score of 6‚Äì1. The Royals struck first on Frank White's groundout with runners on second and third in the top of the first off of Bob Forsch, but the Cardinals tied it off of Danny Jackson in the bottom half on back-to-back two-out doubles by Tom Herr and Jack Clark. However, they would not score after that. The Royals broke the game open in the second when Buddy Biancalana singled to score Jim Sundberg, who doubled with one out. After Lonnie Smith walked, Willie Wilson tripled home both runs to make it 4-1. The Royals added to their lead in the eight off of Jeff Lahti on shortstop Ozzie Smith's throwing error on Danny Jackson's ground ball, then in the ninth on Pat Sheridan's RBI double. Jackson was the winning pitcher, following the same formula and pitching rotation as the Royals did in the ALCS where Jackson also won Game 5. Jackson threw a complete game. =Game 6= A pitcher's duel unfolded between Danny Cox and Charlie Leibrandt, the tough-luck loser in Game 2. The game was marked by controversy. In the fourth inning of the scoreless game, the Royals' Frank White appeared to have stolen second base, but was ruled out in a questionable call. The batter, Pat Sheridan, hit a single to right field two pitches later. This would have likely given the Royals a 1‚Äì0 lead had White been called safe. Instead, Leibrandt and Cox traded scoreless innings until the eighth, when pinch-hitter Brian Harper singled home Terry Pendleton, who had singled earlier, to give the Cardinals a 1‚Äì0 lead. The Cardinals‚Äô 1‚Äì0 lead entering the bottom of the eighth was the result of St. Louis taking the upper hand after two situations that were mirror images of each other: In consecutive half-innings ‚Äì the bottom of the seventh and the top of the eighth ‚Äì both teams had runners on first and second with their respective starting pitcher coming to bat. Kansas City manager Dick Howser opted to leave Leibrandt in the game to bat, but the Royals starter struck out to end the inning. In contrast, Whitey Herzog pulled Cardinals starter Cox for pinch hitter Harper, who then had the game‚Äôs first hit with runners in scoring position to put St. Louis ahead, 1‚Äì0. In the bottom of the ninth, Herzog called on rookie reliever Todd Worrell to relieve setup man Ken Dayley, who had pitched the eighth and would have been the winner had the Cardinals won. The first batter, pinch-hitter Jorge Orta, sent a chopping bouncer to the right of Jack Clark. He tossed to Worrell, who tagged the bag ahead of Orta, but Clark's toss was behind Worrell and it allowed the running Orta to start to come between umpire Don Denkinger and his view of the lunging Worrell's glove. Denkinger called Orta safe. Replays indicated that Orta should have been called out, and an argument ensued on the field. The Cardinals argued briefly but as crew chief and believing he had made the correct call, Denkinger would not reverse it. Orta remained at first. In his book You're Missing A Great Game, Herzog wrote that he later wished he had asked Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, who was in attendance, to overrule the call and declare Orta out. If Ueberroth had refused to do so, Herzog would have pulled his team from the field and forfeited the game. Instead of one out and no one on, the Royals now had no outs and a runner on first for batter Steve Balboni. Balboni lifted a pop-up in foul territory along the edge of the first base dugout. Jack Clark, who had only recently made the transition from right field to first base that season, lost track of the ball as he looked to find the dugout and the ball dropped on the top step of the dugout. Balboni then singled two pitches later, putting runners at first and second with nobody out. Onix Concepci√≥n was sent in as a pinch-runner for the slow-footed Balboni. Catcher Jim Sundberg attempted to sacrifice the runners over, but he failed. With two strikes he bunted anyway and it was sent back to the pitcher and was fielded by Worrell who threw to third for the forceout of Orta for the only out the Cardinals would record. Porter then allowed a passed ball allowing Concepci√≥n and Sundberg to advance to third and second, respectively. With first base now open and two runners in scoring position, Herzog then chose to walk Royals pinch-hitter Hal McRae to set up a potential double-play. McRae would be replaced by the faster John Wathan to pinch-run to avoid a potential double play. With the bases loaded and one out, pinch-hitter Dane Iorg blooped a single to right field. Pinch runner Onix Concepci√≥n scored the tying run and Sundberg approached the plate with the winning run. Right fielder Andy Van Slyke's throw was on the money, but Porter was unable to tag Sundberg before he slid home safely with the game-winning run. The Royals celebrated the rally, and mobbed home plate. The Cardinals went to their dressing rooms, only to find champagne waiting for them and plastic over their lockers in anticipation for the celebration that never came. Denkinger stated that he still believed he had made the right call until he later met with Commissioner Peter Ueberroth after the game and had the opportunity to see the replay himself. He would later claim that he was waiting to hear the ball land in Worrell's glove while watching the bag for Orta's foot. Due to the crowd noise in Royals Stadium, he ruled Orta safe because he never heard Worrell catch the ball. \\"I was in good position, but Worrell is tall, the throw was high, and I couldn't watch his glove and his feet at the same time,\\" Denkinger told Sports Illustrated. \\"It was a soft toss, and there was so much crowd noise, I couldn't hear the ball hit the glove.\\" Denkinger was also scheduled to be the home plate umpire in Game 7\\\\. Kansas City's next World Series appearance came in 2014. In that series' Game 7, after umpire challenges were allowed in major league play, San Francisco Giants manager Bruce Bochy challenged an umpire call where Eric Hosmer of the Royals was initially ruled safe at first base. After video review, the call was overturned, resulting in a double play. It was the first successful manager challenge of an umpire call in World Series history. =Game 7= One night after becoming a father, Bret Saberhagen tossed a five-hitter and got all the offense he needed when Darryl Motley homered to left off John Tudor in the second inning, after a walk to Steve Balboni. In the third, Lonnie Smith led off with a walk, and with one out George Brett hit an infield single. After a double steal, Tudor issued walks to Frank White to load the bases and Jim Sundberg to force in Smith, making the score 3-0. Tudor was replaced with Bill Campbell after only innings. Balboni singled to left off Campbell to score Brett and White to make it 5-0. Tudor walked four and was charged with all five runs. In the dugout, he angrily punched an electrical fan, cutting his pitching hand. The Royals blew the game open in the bottom of the fifth. A succession of five Cardinal pitchers allowed six Royals runs, five coming after two were out. Campbell gave up a single to Sundberg and was immediately replaced by Jeff Lahti, who allowed four runs before being replaced by Ricky Horton. However, after Horton gave up a single to Brett, Herzog immediately replaced him with Joaqu√≠n And√∫jar, normally a starter but pressed into relief. And√∫jar allowed an RBI single to Frank White to increase the Royals lead to 10‚Äì0. With Sundberg at the plate (the Royals had batted around), And√∫jar twice charged home plate umpire Denkinger to disagree with his strike zone. First, Denkinger called an And√∫jar pitch a ball. Herzog, who had been berating Denkinger for most of the game, rushed from the dugout to defend And√∫jar, and was ejected‚Äîreportedly after saying to Denkinger, \\"We wouldn't even be here if you hadn't missed the fucking call last night!\\" According to Denkinger, he replied \\"Well if you guys weren't hitting .120 in this World Series, we wouldn't be here.\\" The next pitch was also called a ball, and Denkinger ejected And√∫jar, who then charged at Denkinger. It took three teammates to restrain him and get him off the field. And√∫jar was suspended for the first ten games of the 1986 season for his outburst. Although it has been rumored that Herzog sent in And√∫jar specifically to bait Denkinger, Herzog himself has said several times And√∫jar was the only pitcher who still had anything left in his arm. After the ejection, Game 4 loser Bob Forsch walked Sundberg (the walk was charged to And√∫jar), but got out of the fifth-inning nightmare. He pitched a clean sixth inning and Ken Dayley kept the Royals off the scoreboard for the last two innings, but it was not enough as the Cardinals could not score any runs against Saberhagen. The Royals became the first team ever to win the World Series after dropping Games 1 and 2 at home. The following year, the New York Mets accomplished the same feat by defeating the Boston Red Sox in seven games. In the 1996 World Series, the New York Yankees lost their first two games at home against the defending 1995 World Series champion Atlanta Braves before winning four straight to claim the title. The Royals also were the fifth team to come back from a three games to one deficit to win a best-of- seven World Series, the others being the 1925 Pittsburgh Pirates, 1958 New York Yankees, 1968 Detroit Tigers, the 1979 Pittsburgh Pirates, and the 2016 Chicago Cubs. The '85 Royals had previously come back from a three games to one deficit to win the American League Championship Series against the Toronto Blue Jays. The six elimination games won by the Royals represent a Major League record for a single postseason, a record which would later be equalled by the 2012 San Francisco Giants. The Cardinals' .185 batting average was the lowest for a seven-game World Series until the New York Yankees hit .183 in the 2001 World Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Cardinals also scored only 13 total runs‚Äîan all-time low for a seven-game series‚Äîscoring only once in the final 26 innings of the series. If they had held on for the win in Game 6, they still would have been outscored in the series 15‚Äì13. The Royals did not play in another postseason game until the 2014 American League Wild Card Game. This was Kansas City's second major professional sports championship, joining the Chiefs' victory in Super Bowl IV in January 1970. Each franchise has added one championship, the Royals in 2015 and the Chiefs in Super Bowl LIV in February 2020.

It is located about 50 km south of Munich, and had a population of 16,262 in 2010. A historic coal mining town, Penzberg today is known for its pharmaceutical industries. History The settlement was first mentioned as Poennesperch in a 1275 contract, when it was sold to the Benediktbeuern Abbey. Surface coal mining had already started in the 16th century, though it was ended by the Thirty Years' War and the industrial exploitation of coal did not begin until 1800. In 1919 Penzberg received town privileges. =World War 2= An allied air raid on 16 November 1944 severely damaged the town, including the parish church, but did not affect the local coal mine, the heart of the town\`s economic life. In order to follow Hitler\`s \\"scorched earth\\" policy (Nero Decree), the local Nazi leaders wanted to blow up the coal mine which was the economic life blood of the town (The End: Hitler's Germany 1944‚Äì45 by Ian Kershaw - p344), so, on 28 April 1945 (the social democratic mayor of Penzberg until the Nazi takeover in 1933) and others deposed the Nazi mayor. However, it was not long before the officer commanding a local Wehrmacht unit had the leaders of the revolt arrested. When, on the evening of the same day, Gauleiter Paul Giesler heard about the incident, he gave orders that the leaders were to be shot immediately without trial. To achieve this, a Werwolf group, around 100 strong, was dispatched, storming the town hall. They arrested and shot Rummer and seven fellows. During the night, a further eight suspected resistance fighters were hanged by a \\"drumhead court-martial\\" under SA brigade leader . Among the victims were two women, one of them pregnant. The very next day, the Americans arrived. The massacre is known as the ' (Night of Penzberg Murder). The mine was not destroyed, and remained open until 1966 when it closed for economic reasons; the adjacent power plant was also shut down in 1971. Transportation The town is served by Penzberg station on the Kochelsee Railway.
