A domed maqam, Neby Samat, stood to the south.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 26. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p.314 SWP further noted \\"Caves exist here, and ruined tombs; one was a square chamber without loculi; another, a large tomb with a rock pillar, but now much broken, and the plan of the original form destroyed. This tomb is close to the Mukam of Neby Samit—a domed chamber, with an outer chamber to the west, and a door to the north, on which side is a courtyard, with a palm tree. The chamber has a mihrab, and by it are green rags, said to be the Prophet's clothes. In the court are two Arab graves. To the west are several kokim tombs (stone carved sepulchres) full of bones and skulls. Other caves, cisterns, and a wine-press, north of the Mukam, were observed.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 158 Sheikh Samit, or Samat, was said to have been the brother of Shemshun el Jabar, whose Neby was at Ishwa.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 164 J. Geikie described the shrine in the 1880s: \\"A mukam, or shrine, of a Mussulman saint stands on the south side of the village; a low square building of stone, with a humble dome and a small court, within an old stone wall, at the side. You enter the yard through a small door in this wall, up two or three steps, but beyond the bare walls, and a solitary palm-tree, twice the height of the wall, there is nothing to see. Sheikh Samat, whoever he was, lies solitary enough and well forgotten in his airy sepulchre, but the whitewash covering his resting-place marks a custom which is universal with Mussulman tombs of this kind.\\"Geikie, 1888, p. 67 In 1896 the population of Sar'a was estimated to be about 168 persons.Schick, 1896, p. 123 =British Mandate= In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Sara'a had a population 205, all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table VII, Sub-district of Jerusalem, p. 15 increasing in the 1931 census to 271, still all Muslims, in 65 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 43 In the 1945 statistics the population of Saris was 340, all Muslims, who owned 4,967 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey.

Many of the inhabitants had already fled, as the village had been on the front lines since April.Morris, 2004, p. 436 Those who had remained fled when the mortar barrages from the approaching Harel columns began; the few that stayed throughout the assault were later expelled. The village's inhabitants fled the village towards various West Bank refugee camps, including Qalandiya. =Israel= Following the war, the area was incorporated into the State of Israel. The moshav of Tarum was established on the north-eastern part of Sar'a's land in 1950, while Tzora was established about 2 km southwest of the site, on land belonging to Dayr Aban. According to the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, the remaining structures on village land in 1992 were: > Stone rubble and iron girders are strewn among the trees on the site. A flat > stone, surrounded by debris and inscribed with Arabic verses from the > Qur'an, bears the date A.H. 1355 (1936).

He served as city marshal of Junction City, Kansas from 1871 to 1904. Before that he was a seaman, miner, fur trapper and hunter. He served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. Early life Tom Allen was born in Kilrush, Ireland in 1838 to well-to-do parents.Kirchner, Paul. The Deadliest Men: The World's Deadliest Combatants throughout the Ages. Colorado: Paladin Press, 2001. Career =Young seaman and pilot= A Mississippi River Boat, 1815 When he was eleven years old, he became a seaman and spent six years exploring the world. He worked at first for the English revenue service, where he visited ports in British Isles, France, Hamburg, and the Mediterranean. He then went to the East and West Indies and South America. During that time he learned how to navigate and take charge of a ship. In 1854, he was in Crimea and the following year he worked on a passenger ship from Liverpool to New York. He then traveled within the United States as a seaman on the Great Lakes. During that time, he survived a shipwreck on Lake Erie and also became a proficient Mississippi River pilot. =Fur trapper and hunter= \\"The Fur Trapper\\", Harper's Weekly, January 23, 1869 In 1857, he was an employee of the American Fur Company and traveled to the Rocky Mountains. He hunted and trapped animals from Yellowstone to the Taos Valley. During the summer of 1858, he spent some time at a ranch in New Mexico on the Cimarron River owned by Lucien Maxwell and Kit Carson. Both ranchers offered Allen a job as a partner, but Allen refused. =Miner and explorer= Denver, 1859 Tom Allen traveled to the Denver region and became a miner. Moreover, he staked a claim with three other men to land extending . There was a dispute to the ownership of the land and the four men (including Allen) reinforced their collective stake by erecting a large log house with firing ports in each wall. The land dispute progressed to the point where a company of 80 armed men were dispatched to remove Allen and his co-claimants. Allen allowed one of the armed men to step forward and revealed the defenses placed on the land. The armed man reported back and everyone in the 80-strong company decided to leave. Oddly enough, the land in what is now downtown Denver was eventually sold for a meager amount of money to Francis J. Marshall. Allen was involved in his first major fistfight during his stay in Denver. When he saw a gentleman publicly strike a woman, Allen challenged the assailant to a no-holds-barred confrontation. Afterwards, Allen lectured the attacker for an hour and a half on the evils of domestic violence. A man known as the \\"Terror of the Gulch\\" attempted to steal Tom Allen's sluice water. As a result, Allen attempted to settle the matter diplomatically. This option ultimately failed and Allen offered to solve the dispute either \\"according to the rules of the ring\\" or through \\"rough-and-tumble.\\" The Terror chose the latter, which allowed for the use of fighting techniques such as eye-gouging, biting, stomping, and head butting. A crowd emerged as Allen demonstrated the dynamics of \\"rough-and-tumble.\\" In the end, the \\"Terror of the Gulch\\" was beaten and left the area. =Explorer= Colorado River map Many merchants in Denver employed Allen and two of his land co-claimants, Jack Menzies and David Thompson, to explore the Colorado River. This expedition took place eight years before the explorations of Major John Wesley Powell. Unfortunately, Allen and his associates were captured by the Native American Utes after only into their expedition. When one of the tribesmen pulled Allen's ear, Allen punched the Ute and made him fall to the ground. Afterwards, Allen told the chief in Spanish that the Utes were cowards and that he could defeat the tribe's best warrior. Unfortunately, there is no confirmation as to whether the chief fulfilled Allen's request or was merely amused by Allen's bravado. Overall, Allen and his land co-claimants were set free. He returned to Leavenworth. =Civil War= Broadside recruiting men for the Independent Kansas Jayhawkers, 1st Kansas Volunteer Cavalry During the American Civil War, Allen enlisted in the Union Army as a scout in the eastern states. He served with St. Clair and \\"Red Clark\\", riding through Kansas, Missouri, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee. In 1863, he was in Leavenworth, Kansas when the town was occupied by a group of paramilitary units known as the Jayhawkers. Two police officers were shot and the town marshal was forced to leave. Upon the urgent request of the authorities, Allen decided to become chief of police. Allen faced the Jayhawkers using his \\"rough-and-tumble\\" techniques. In thirty days, he restored order to Leavenworth and afterwards relinquished his position. =Junction City marshal= After the war and until 1871, he came to Junction City and had contracts to supply meat to the military and railroad construction crews. In 1871, he became the city marshal of Junction City. The mayor, George Martin, stated that \\"The post was not a sinecure.\\" Various brothels and saloons elicited rabble rousing troops from Fort Riley, as well as travelers coming from intersecting railway lines. The city's newspaper, the Junction City Union, reported the following on April 25, 1885: Junction City, Kansas from the railroad, 1867. Boston Public Library Of the many exploits Tom Allen had while he was the city marshal of Junction City, a recruit from Fort Riley (along with twelve companions) intended to pull back Allen's ears. As a result, the recruit was injured and sent back to Fort Riley in an ambulance. In another incident, Allen entered a saloon while it was being vandalized by eight soldiers. Allen defeated each soldier and dragged seven of them to the jail. The eighth one managed to escape. Allen went to Fort Riley the next morning in order to arrest the eighth soldier. When the captain learned that Allen was present, he stated: \\"Great Scott, that's the man who licked my sergeant! He can have him.\\" Allen confronted a drifter that according to newspaper accounts executed \\"a beastly offense to a little girl.\\" Allen faced the six-foot man and decided to punish him with physical force instead of having him go to court. In another incident, a drunk which Allen imprisoned multiple times started a quarrel in a local pub and according to the Junction City Union, \\"stood out in the street with a rock in each hand when Tom arrived. 'Looking for a fight, are you? Remarked the peace officer as he gave him a wipe on the jaw, knocking him down and punishing him severely. This individual has never drank a drop since, and has thanked Tom repeatedly for that thrashing.\\" A tall red-headed stranger entered Junction City in 1884. While in a general store, he created panic when he held his Colt revolver at the patrons. Allen warned the man to take the next train that was leaving in a half-hour. The man ignored Allen and during evening hours, he started a commotion at a hotel. Allen again told the redheaded man to leave town. The next day, the man was causing an uproar at a cheap, dingy drinking establishment. Allen finally intervened and said, \\"Now I will take you in.\\" On his way to prison, the redheaded man stated to Allen, \\"You're not man enough to take me in\\" and slapped him. As a result, Allen was irate, thrashed the man in a bloody fight, disarmed his Colt, and threw him in a prison cell. Afterwards, Allen threw the blood-encrusted man into the next train. Mayor George Martin stated, \\"I think this was his last experience with amateur prize-fighters who came to test his mettle.\\" For thirty-three years, Tom Allen served as city marshal in Junction City. During his many confrontations, he was not responsible for a single death and was never injured. Personal life Allen was married in 1865. In 1885, he had a wife and seven children and a 200-acre farm halfway between Junction City, Kansas and Fort Riley. He died on June 18, 1904 in a Kansas City, Missouri hospital.

According to a review in The Real Paper, \\"they could blow virtually any other band in the country right off the stage.\\" The album was released in July 1975, at a time when the band was opening for the Rolling Stones on their U.S. Tour. The album sold 88,000 copies and didn't meet the record label's expectations. According to Rupert Surcouf, the band's road manager at the time, the record label realized \\"the Meters didn't fit into any conventional mold\\", and the label had difficulty promoting the music. Reception Stephen Erlewine of AllMusic had a positive view and wrote \\"there never seems to be a concession to mainstream funk\\" and called the music \\"simmering\\".

The name comes from their cover of the Earl King single of the same name. Background In spring of 1976 the band was on tour opening for the Rolling Stones on their Tour of Europe '76. According to Jason Berry's Up from the Cradle of Jazz, several tracks on this album are preliminary recordings and were selected for release in the absence of band members. Reception Stephen Erlewine had a negative view and critiqued the album's attempt to sound mainstream. He singles out three tracks as exceptions: \\"Mister Moon\\", \\"Doodle Loop\\" and \\"Honky Tonk Women\\". Joe McEwen of Rolling Stones critiqued the song choices and the attempt to please the commercial market. He said two tracks are in-line with the band's style: \\"Doodle Loop\\" and \\"Chug-a-Lug\\", and had a positive view of the title track \\"Trick Bag\\".

The format actually stores its song data in MIDI format but it differs in that while General MIDI instruments are standardised, CMF instruments' data are stored in the file itself, much like MOD files. This allows a large range of instruments to be used, and unlike MIDI the song should sound the same regardless of which synthesiser it is played through. While MOD files store their instruments as digital data (\\"samples\\"), CMF instruments are stored as a set of register values that can be programmed into the OPL chips that were part of all early Sound Blaster cards (a feature that made them compatible with competing Adlib cards at the time.) Because CMF music is played through these OPL chips, it has a distinctly synthesised sound. However, in the early 1990s when the format first came out this allowed songs to be synthesised entirely in hardware, meaning the performance impact of using CMF music was very low. For this reason the music in a number of games from this era (such as Kiloblaster and Jill of the Jungle) was in CMF format. Technical specifications The CMF format uses the filename extension. Files can be identified by the file signature in the first four bytes, which will be the ASCII characters \\"CTMF\\" (Creative Technology Music File) if the file is in CMF format. The instruments inside a CMF file are stored in an identical manner to that used in SBI files (Sound Blaster Instrument), minus the SBI header. The music block is in standard MIDI format, allowing for easy conversion between .mid and .cmf files. The CMF format also assigned a new meaning to a handful of MIDI controllers, so they could be used to change different aspects of playback (such as switching between the OPL's 9-channel FM synthesis mode and its alternate 6-channel + 5-percussion \\"rhythm mode\\" synthesis). External links * The CMF format article on the Game Modding Wiki has a detailed description of the CMF file format. * The CMF article at the Video Game Music Preservation Foundation Wiki provides some further links to tools to play, convert (to and from), edit, and extract CMF files, and a list of game titles that employed the format.

Background Hardy, born 23 April 1809, was the eldest son of John Hardy and Isabele Gathorne. Gathorne Gathorne-Hardy, 1st Earl of Cranbrook, was his younger brother. He attended Oriel College, Oxford, gaining a BA in 1831, and a MA in 1834. On 13 June 1846 at Farnborough Church, Warwickshire, he married Laura Holbech or Holbeck, third daughter of William Holbech of Farnborough Hall, Warwickshire. At Low Moor, Bradford, the \\"roaring of cannon\\" and the \\"merry note of village bells\\" continued throughout the day. At 4.30pm the event was celebrated by 40 agents of the Low Moor Ironworks at Buttershaw House, with many toasts and speeches. The cannon \\"poured forth their voices of thunder\\" once more at nine pm. The eldest of their three surviving sons was Sir Reginald Hardy (1848–1938), a JP and deputy lieutenant for Staffordshire, who succeeded to the baronetcy. A younger son was barrister Gerald Holbeck Hardy (Atherstone 1852 - Burton-upon-Trent 1929) of Arlington Street, Picadilly. Births Sep 1852 Hardy Gerald Holbeck Atherstone 6d 279 Deaths Mar 1929 Hardy Gerald H. 76 Burton 6b 613 Gerald served as a major in the Queen's Own Royal Regiment, Staffordshire, in 1914. Career Hardy was the proprietor of the Low Moor Ironworks, Bradford. He was elected to the House of Commons for Midhurst in March 1859, but held the seat for less than two months. The following year he was returned for Dartmouth, a constituency he represented until 1868, and then sat for Warwickshire South from 1868 to 1874. His three unsuccessful attempts at representation were Plymouth (1857), Banbury (1859) and East Staffordshire (1880). On 23 February 1876 he was created baronet of Dunstall Hall in the County of Stafford. In 1878 he was appointed High Sheriff of Staffordshire, after serving there as deputy lieutenant and magistrate, and on the Commission of the Peace for the West Riding of Yorkshire. Death St Mary Dunstall where Hardy is buried John Hardy died aged 79 years on Monday 2 July 1888, after being hit by a brougham in windy weather and busy traffic while crossing South Audley Street, London, to post a letter. He sustained a compound fracture of the right femur, was placed on the floor of the brougham and taken the short distance to 22 South street, Park Lane. The wound did not begin to heal, and he died at home on the afternoon of 9 July 1888 of shock and exhaustion. The coroner's enquiry found that Hardy was of sound mind and that the driver of the brougham was not to blame. The funeral took place at 2 o'clock on Friday 13 July, at Dunstall Hall.

Don Hutto Residential Center (formerly known as T. Don Hutto Family Residential Facility, and the T. Don Hutto Family Detention Facility) is a guarded, fenced-in, multi-purpose center currently used to detain non-US citizens awaiting the outcome of their immigration status. The center is located at 1001 Welch Street in the city of Taylor, Texas, within Williamson County. Formerly a medium-security state prison, it is operated by the CoreCivic under contract with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (known as ICE) through an ICE Intergovernmental Service Agreement (IGA) with Williamson County, Texas.Don Hutto Family Residential Facility In 2006, Hutto became an immigrant-detention facility detaining immigrant families. The facility was turned into a women's detention center in 2009. History In July 1997, the T. Don Hutto Correctional Facility by was opened by CCA as a medium security prison. By 2000, Tennessee-based CCA's stocks hit their lowest, as it suffered from \\"poor management\\", prison riots and escapes. It had failed in the 1990s in its \\"bid to take over the entire prison system of Tennessee.\\" It is named after T. Don Hutto, who along with Robert Crants and Tom Beasley, co-founded CCA on January 28, 1983 in Nashville, Tennessee. In March 2004 CCA announced plans to close the facility, citing low inmate demand. Immigration detention increased after 9/11. In October 2005, Michael Chertoff, then Secretary of Homeland Security, said that DHS would \\"return every single illegal entrant\\" apprehended by U.S. authorities without exception and would make use of $90 million in funds appropriated by Congress to add additional beds in immigration detention facilities. By the July 2006, Chertoff told a House subcommittee that DHS had \\"achieved essentially 100 percent catch-and-remove.\\" As a result, by the end of 2006, the number of people in government custody for immigration-law violations increased by 79% from 2005. There were about 14,000 people being detained. T. Don Hutto re- opened in May 2006 as a \\"Family Residential Facility\\" to detain immigrant families. Previously, illegal immigrants with children would be released with a notice to appear before an immigration judge. In some cases, where release was not approved by ICE, children were separated from their parents. Parents were sent to an adult facility while children were released to family, or sent to the Office of Refugee Resettlement. A 2007 report entitled \\"Locking Up Family Values\\" by the Women's Refugee Commission and Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services documented conditions in the facility. The detainees were women and their children - most of whom appeared to be under the age of 12. The report noted that most of the residents were from Central and South America. However, there were also Africans, Asians, Europeans, and Middle Easterners. Many of the families held at the Hutto facility were awaiting adjudication of their claims for relief or asylum. Many of these families of the families held at the former prison are charged with no offenses other than illegal entry. The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against ICE in March 2007 on behalf of 10 juvenile plaintiffs that were housed in the facility at the time claiming that the standards by which they were housed was not in compliance with the government's detention standards for this population. The claims were, amongst other things, improper educational opportunities, not enough privacy, and substandard health care. The relief being sought was the release of the plaintiffs. In August 2007, after the plaintiffs were no longer housed at the facility, the ACLU settled the lawsuit claiming that the situations at the facility had \\"significantly improved\\". In 2007, Justice Sam Sparks approved the settlement between the ACLU and ICE that greatly improved conditions for immigrant children and their families who were detained at the facility. Dozens of children were released with their families as a result of the settlement. In response to the harsh treatment of young children in T. Don Hutto, Judge Sparks established \\"the government would have to establish clear rules for how to detain families safely and humanely. And although officials at Hutto might be making changes now, he noted, didn’t Lawrence have a feeling it was merely because the defendants knew, on account of the lawsuit, that 'the hammer was coming down?\\" He said that he was beginning to wonder who was in charge \\"out there, either C.C.A. or the government. It’s very troubling to me.\\" The Least of These is a documentary based on the lawsuit and sub-par conditions. \\"[A]fter years of controversy, media exposure, and a lawsuit\\", in 2009, the Obama Administration closed T. Don Hutto Family Detention Facility, the United States’ \\"largest family immigration detention facility.\\" \\"Conditions at the T. Don Hutto Family Detention Facility, and the impact of detention on families and children, proved that family detention could not be carried out humanely.\\" On August 6, 2009, federal officials announced that T. Don Hutto would no longer house immigrant families. Instead, only female detainees will be housed there.

It stands between Great Gable and Haystacks in the Western Fells. Topography The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north-east and Wasdale to the south-east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Volume 7 The Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1966): Brandreth is a near neighbour of Great Gable, forming part of the head of Ennerdale. The spine of the range runs north from Great Gable via Green Gable to Brandreth, before curving north-west to form the watershed between Ennerdale and Buttermere. The fells along this section are Haystacks and the High Stile group. A lesser ridge also runs out north-east from Brandreth to Grey Knotts, bending around parallel to the main range to form the side valley of Warnscale. Fleetwith Pike encloses Warnscale on the other side. As a consequence of its three connecting ridges, Brandreth assumes a triangular plan. The south-west face falls steeply, but relatively smoothly to Ennerdale, Brin Crag being the only prominent feature. To the east a rim of crags mark the drop into Gillercomb. This classic hanging valley lies between Brandreth and Base Brown, emptying around the latter into the wide strath of Borrowdale at Seathwaite. The northern slopes fall gently toward Warnscale, the workings of Dubs Quarry lying at the foot of the slope. Brandreth is thus the only fell to feed Ennerdale Water, Derwentwater and Buttermere. The ridge connecting to Green Gable narrows to Gillercomb Head, complete with a number of small tarns, following the line of the ruined Ennerdale boundary fence. The connection to Grey Knotts is wider, but still a definite ridge, crossing the stony terrain where the transition from one fell to the other is hard to determine. North westward the topography is more complex, a sloping tableland gradually resolving into the ridge of Haystacks as the high ground is squeezed between Warnscale Beck and the River Liza. The rocky top of Great Round How marks the completion of the change. Geology The summit area composes the plagioclase-phyric andesite lavas of the Birker Fell Formation. A band of volcaniclastic sandstone passes near to the actual top. Further south are outcroppings of the Whorneyside Formation (bedded tuff and sandstone with some breccias, interspersed with andesite sills.) The lower slopes are covered by drift.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) Dubs Quarry at the foot of the northern slope is an extensive slate working, now abandoned. Summit The summit area is bleak and stony, marked by the remains of old fences. The top is identified by a cairn built around a boundary post where the three ridgeline fences meet. The view south is obstructed by the Gables, but in all other directions the high fells of Lakeland are laid out. Pillar, High Stile and the North Western Fells are particularly well seen, a view enhanced from lower down the western slope. Ascents The summit of Honister Pass provides a convenient high level start. There is a well marked and mainly stoned path starting close to the youth hostel which leads directly to the summit by way of Grey Knotts. Another route follows the remains of the inclined tramway to the Drum House and then contours around the western slopes of Grey Knotts. From Gatesgarth at the head of Buttermere, a path runs up the valley of Warnscale Beck. Passing around the crags of Haystacks it then crosses the plateau to pick up the Ennerdale fence, bound for Brandreth. If climbing from Borrowdale then the path alongside Sour Milk Gill into Gillercomb can be used, followed by a stiff pull up to Gillercomb Head. A long walk up Ennerdale can also be the prelude to an ascent of Brandreth. Many walkers will ascend the fell indirectly from one of its neighbours, or avoid the summit altogether as they follow the contouring path from Honister to Great Gable.Bill Birkett: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): .

It occupies a wide upland area with Ennerdale to the north and Blengdale to the south. Caw Fell is distant from any point of access by Lakeland standards, but can be climbed from Blengdale or Bowness Knott car- parks. Topography The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Volume 7 The Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1966): Caw Fell stands on the southern arm. The main watershed runs broadly westwards from Great Gable, dividing the headwaters of Ennerdale and Wasdale. The main fells in this section are Kirk Fell, Pillar, Scoat Fell, Haycock and Caw Fell. The surrounding valleys gradually diverge until at Caw Fell they are 6 miles apart and other rivers spring up to drain the intervening country. The Bleng rises to the south of Caw Fell, while Worm Gill drains the western slopes. The fell is therefore the end of the westerly run of the ridge, and the watershed curves north around the head of Worm Gill, crossing the subsidiary top of Iron Crag on the transit to Crag Fell and Lank Rigg. The unnamed col connecting Caw Fell to Haycock is flat topped and carries the Ennerdale Fence, in this section a substantial dry stone wall. Tongue Gill, the principal headwater of the Bleng, flows from the southern side of the saddle while on the opposite side is the steep headwall of Silver Cove, a deeply enclosed side-valley running into Ennerdale. The heathery spur of Tongue End runs parallel to the east. West of the summit a broad ridge descends steeply to Worm Gill, a craggy bowl scooped out on the northern side above the tributary of Bleaberry Gill. Running due north between this corrie and Silver Cove is the ridge of Iron Crag, making the whole summit area resemble an inverted 'T' in plan. A narrow and steep sided col at 1,575 ft provides Iron Crag with considerably more prominence than its parent, a small tarn lying on the northern slope. The rock face giving Iron Crag its name overlooks Silver Cove, but is not particularly prominent. From this top the ridge swings west again, the rough northern flanks running above the shore of Ennerdale Water. The main features here are Mart Knott, Stair Knott and Boat How. The ridge now meets the headwaters of the River Calder and divides to embrace the valley, Crag Fell to the north and Lank Rigg to the south. Caw Fell also has a lower level south west ridge, running down between the River Bleng and Worm Gill. This descends first to Stockdale Moor, a site littered with tumuli, hut circles, enclosures and other remnants of ancient habitation. Beyond are the low hills centred on Ponsonby Fell (1,033 ft), not included by Alfred Wainwright in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, but covered by other guidebooks.Bill Birkett: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): Geology The north eastern flanks are overlain by drift deposits with the plagioclase-phyric andesite lavas of the Birker Fell Formation beneath. The rest of the fell exhibits rock of the Ennerdale Intrusion, granophyric granite.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) Iron Crag Mine operated below the crag of that name from around 1864 to 1896. 500 tons of haematite ore was raised in 1881, but the mine never proved a commercial success. Other smaller operations ran briefly in Silver Cove and Deep Gill.Adams, John: Mines of the Lake District Fells: Dalesman (1995) Summit The top stands to the north of the wall, marked by a cairn. Caw Fell is remote from higher fells and gives an all round panorama of the Western Fells and the Scafells. It is necessary to cross the wall to take in the full view. Ascents The south west ridge over Stockdale Moor can be followed from the car park at Bleng Bridge, this being over five miles each way. From Bowness Knott in Ennerdale, Caw Fell can be reached in a similar distance via the Tongue End spur. Indirect ascents can be made via Grike and Crag Fell from the Kinniside Stone Circle.

It is part of the Lank Rigg group, standing above Ennerdale Water in the Western Fells. The craggy northern face above the lake gives the fell its name, prominent in views from the car park at Bowness Knott. Ascents are commonly made from the foot of Ennerdale Water. Topography The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Volume 7 The Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1966): Crag Fell stands near the extremity of the southern arm. The main watershed runs broadly westwards from Great Gable, dividing the headwaters of Ennerdale and Wasdale. The fells in this section are Kirk Fell, Pillar, Scoat Fell, Haycock and Caw Fell. The surrounding valleys gradually diverge until other rivers spring up to drain the intervening country. Worm Gill is one such watercourse, running south westward from Caw Fell, and forcing the ridge to detour northwards around the head of its valley. Beyond this stand the fells of the Lank Rigg group, the final high country within the National Park. Crag Fell and Grike complete the westward line of the ridge, whilst Lank Rigg lies to the south across the head of the River Calder. The northern flanks of Crag Fell tumble roughly down to the shore of Ennerdale Water. One tier of crags is directly below the summit, Revelin Crag being a notable feature, whilst a second abuts the lake itself. This is Anglers Crag, also known as Robin Hood's Chair. By contrast the southern slopes fall steadily to the headstream of the Calder, the lower section being planted with conifers. South eastward from Crag Fell begins the long ridge to Caw Fell, first descending to a col at 1,320 ft and then rising gently over the intermediate top of Iron Crag. To the west a narrower ridge runs along above the plantation to Grike. Crag Fell is bounded by Ben Gill in the west and Red Beck in the east. thumb Mining The remains of a number of iron mines can be found above the shore of the lake. Small trials were driven beneath Revelin Crag, above Anglers Crag and on the upper eastern slopes above Red Beck. Although haematite was found, the quantities were never sufficient and all of the mines had closed by 1896.Adams, John: Mines of the Lake District Fells: Dalesman (1995) Summit There are two mounds on the top of the fell, that to the north west being the summit. The whole area is undulating and grassy. There is a wide panorama to seaward, taking in what Alfred Wainwright described as the \\"grotesque collection of towers and minarets of the Calder Hall atomic power station\\". The head of Ennerdale Water is seen to the east, surrounded by the high cirque of the Western Fells. Distant Fairfield and Ullscarf put in unexpected appearances through the gaps. Ascents A narrow road runs east from the village of Ennerdale Bridge, giving access to a pair of car parks near the outflow of the lake. Two principal alternatives are available from here to climb Crag Fell. The first is to loosely follow the course of Ben Gill up beside the plantation, before swinging left toward the summit. A more interesting route is to use the lakeshore path to reach the top of Anglers Crag, before working up the hillside to turn Revelin Crag to the west. This takes the walker past what Wainwright called the Crag Fell Pinnacles, a fractured spine of rock rising 80 ft above the angle of the slope. Other ascents can be made from the Coldfell Road, south of Ennerdale Bridge. A track, formerly the mine road, can be followed almost to the summit, passing over the flanks of Grike. A circuit of the upper Calder, taking in the whole Lank Rigg group can also be started from here.Bill Birkett: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): References Category:Fells of the Lake District Category:Borough of Copeland ","title":"Crag Fell"},{"id":"9420525","text":"Gavel Fell is a hill in the English Lake District. Centremost of the five Loweswater Fells in the western part of the District, it stands between Hen Comb and Blake Fell. Of moderate altitude it can be climbed from Loweswater village, or from Croasdale to the west. Topography The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Volume 7 The Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1966): Gavel Fell and the other Loweswater Fells form the extremity of the northern arm. The Loweswater Fells have been compared to the digits of a hand, radiating out south westward from the \\"palm\\" centred on Loweswater village. From the west these are Burnbank Fell, Blake Fell, Gavel Fell, Hen Comb and Mellbreak, the \\"thumb\\". Gavel Fell being the \\"middle finger\\" has a long ridge running south west from the valley. This rises gently at first past High Nook farm, before accelerating its climb up the face of Black Crag to the summit plateau. A subsidiary top (1,601 ft) is reached first, unnamed on Ordnance Survey maps but referred to as High Nook in some guidebooks.Bill Birkett: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): The ridge widens, damply, and turns south at the summit, dropping over a rough patch of ground named White Oak. Beyond is Banna Fell (1,496 ft), which could lay claim to separate status but is generally considered a subsidiary of Gavel Fell. Banna Fell has a very prominent eastern top named Floutern Cop (1,480 ft). On the Loweswater side Gavel Fell is neatly contained by Highnook Beck to the north west and Whiteoak Beck to the east. These merge beneath the nose of the ridge at High Nook Farm, before joining Dub Beck, the outflow of Loweswater. One of the feeders of Highnook Beck is High Nook Tarn, a small pool with a low earth dam. Tarns are unusual in this part of the District, although Gavel Fell has a share in a second on its southern boundary. This is Floutern Tarn, lying beneath Floutern Cop. A long brooding pool with a depth of about 12 ft, Floutern Tarn drains east and then north into the morass of Mosedale.Blair, Don: Exploring Lakeland Tarns: Lakeland Manor Press (2003): A walker's pass, Floutern Tarn Pass, crosses beside Floutern, providing access from Buttermere to Ennerdale. The western side follows Gill Beck, the southern boundary of Gavel Fell. The western face of the fell is drained by Croasdale Beck, a tributary of the Ehen. Geology Gavel Fell is formed from rocks of the Kirk Stile Formation, commonly associated with the Skiddaw range. These consist of laminated mudstone and siltstone.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) Whiteoak Lead Mine consisted of several levels and a shaft, operating between 1864 and 1891.

Ascents From Loweswater a start can be made up the track to High Nook farm. At the tarn, the walker can turn to either flank of the ridge to pass Black Crag, before making for the summit. From Croasdale the west ridge of Banna Fell can be used, although entailing a roundabout route, as walkers are no longer welcome to use the more direct line up Croasdale Beck to White Oak (this route has now been omitted from the revised edition of Wainwright's guide to the Western Fells). Ascents via Floutern Pass can also be soured by the attitude of the landowner, who covets every last blade of grass.

It stands to the south of Ennerdale in the Western Fells. A sprawling hill with gentle grassy slopes it can be climbed from various points on the Coldfell road. It carries various remains from ancient habitation. Topography The Western Fells occupy a triangular sector of the Lake District, bordered by the River Cocker to the north east and Wasdale to the south east. Westwards the hills diminish toward the coastal plain of Cumberland. At the central hub of the high country are Great Gable and its satellites, while two principal ridges fan out on either flank of Ennerdale, the western fells in effect being a great horseshoe around this long wild valley.Alfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Volume 7 The Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1966): Lank Rigg is the highest of the group of fells at the extremity of the southern arm. The main watershed runs broadly westwards from Great Gable, dividing the headwaters of Ennerdale and Wasdale. The fells in this section are Kirk Fell, Pillar, Scoat Fell, Haycock and Caw Fell. The surrounding valleys gradually diverge until other rivers spring up to drain the intervening country. Worm Gill is one such watercourse, running south westward from Caw Fell, and forcing the ridge to detour northwards around the head of its valley. Beyond this stand the fells of the Lank Rigg group, the final high country within the National Park. Crag Fell and Grike complete the westward line of the ridge, whilst Lank Rigg itself stands to the south across the head of the River Calder. Lank Rigg occupies an upland area about 2 miles square, bordered by the River Calder and Worm Gill to east and west. Worm Gill sweeps around the southern flank of the fell, joining the Calder at Thornholme to complete the moat on three sides. To the north east, via the subsidiary top of Whoap (1,676 ft), is a connection to the main ridge. This joins it perpendicularly between Crag Fell and Caw Fell. The slopes of Lank Rigg are uniformly gentle, clad in grass with the occasional rash of stones. There is a small tarn just below the summit to the south west. Although Wainwright regarded only Lank Rigg as an independent summit, other guidebooks give equal prominence to Whoap and the western tops of Latterbarrow (1,161 ft) and Kinniside (1,230 ft).Bill Birkett: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): History Lank Rigg carries the remains of ancient settlement with a tumulus near the summit and various enclosures and cairns near Tongue Bank. These are marked as ‘cairn’, ‘settlement’ and ‘homestead’ on Ordnance Survey maps. Summit The highest point bears an Ordnance Survey triangulation column. The Lakeland view is uninspiring, apart from an unexpected appearance by distant Blencathra, but the coastal plain is well seen. To mark the completion of his Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Alfred Wainwright buried a two-shilling (now ten pence) piece under a stone at the summit. He made mention of this in the last volume so that the first reader on the fell could collect the prize. It was, as he said, ‘a reckless thing to do’. Visitors to the summit may still occasionally find coins hidden there by generous fellwalkers in memory of Wainwright’s act. Ascents The unfenced Coldfell road runs south from Ennerdale Bridge to Calder Bridge, providing the best access to Lank Rigg. A footpath leads off eastward between Blakeley Raise and Burn Edge, dropping into the upper Calder valley. This can then be followed to the col between Whoap and Lank Rigg. A circular outing can be devised from the same starting point, also visiting Crag Fell and Grike. From further south on the road a lane gives access to the Calder just opposite Tongue How. A long ascent up the south western slopes then follows.

Progressive Bloc was an alliance of political forces in the Russian Empire and occupied 236 of the 442 seats in the Imperial Duma. It was formed when the State Duma of the Russian Empire was recalled to session during World War I, the response of Nicholas II of Russia to mounting social tensions. On instigation of Pavel Milyukov the Progressist Party combined with the Kadet Party, Left Octobrists, and progressive Nationalists and individual politicians as Vasily Shulgin to form a political front in the Duma that called for a \\"government of confidence\\". According to the Bolsheviks it supported a social-chauvinist stance towards the continuation of World War I. The program content was determined by the desire to find common ground for an agreement with the government on the basis of a minimum of liberal reforms. \\"The Progressive Bloc's program included demands for political and religious amnesty, the abolition of restrictions on nationalities and faiths (Poles, Jews, etc.), and the freedom of trade unions. The Bloc's main demand was the formation of a “ministry of confidence.” A meeting took place on 9 September 1915 between the Bloc's representatives and ministers, where the deputies not only demanded the fulfillment of the Bloc's program, but also the resignation of the ministers themselves. The negotiations resulted in the government advocating for the Duma's suspension, which took place on 16 September 1915.\\" The Imperial Duma was sent into recess by the Tsar and would not gather again until February 1916. By the beginning of 1916, Alexei Khvostov came to a compromise with the Progressive Bloc, relying on the moderate nature of its demands. The Duma gathered on 9 February after the 76-year-old Ivan Goremykin, opposed to the convening of the Duma, had been dismissed and replaced by Stürmer as prime minister. However the deputies were disappointed when Stürmer held his speech. Because of the war, he said, it was not the time for constitutional reforms. For the first time in his life, the Tsar made a visit to the Taurida Palace, which made it practically impossible to hiss at the new prime minister Stürmer. In October 1916 the opposition parties decided to attack Boris Stürmer, his government and the \\"Dark forces\\".Gytis Gudaitis (2005) Armeen Rußlands und Deutschlands im 1. Weltkrieg und in den Revolutionen von 1917 und 1918 : ein Vergleich. Thesis. Katholische Universität Eichstätt-Ingolstadt. p. 142. For the Octobrists and the Kadets, the liberals in the parliament, Grigori Rasputin, who believed in autocracy and absolute monarchy, was one of the main obstacles. On 1 November (O.S.) the government under Boris Stürmer was attacked by Milyukov in the Imperial Duma. The Progressist Party left the Bloc after demanding for a responsible government. Stürmer and Alexander Protopopov (his unexpected appointment was seen as a provocation designed to split the Bloc) asked in vain for the dissolution of the Duma. Alexander Guchkov reported that five members of the Progressive Bloc, including Kerensky, Aleksandr Konovalov, Nikolai Vissarionovich Nekrasov and Mikhail Tereschenko would consider a coup d'etat, but did not undertake any action. Grand Duke Nikolai refused to cooperate, saying that the army would not support a coup. The Progressive Bloc supported a resolution that the Tsar was to be replaced by his son Tsarevich Alexei. The new prime minister Alexander Trepov offered to satisfy some of the Bloc's demands. In the lead up to the February revolution 1917, it is often argued to play a crucial role in the uprising's success through the suggestion to Tsar Nicholas II that he should establish a 'government of public confidence'. The Tsar instead made little attempt to make political reform or slip into a constitutional monarch that, potentially, could have saved the Romanov dynasty.Glossary of Organisations: Pr References Category:1915 establishments in the Russian Empire Category:Defunct political party alliances in Russia Category:Political parties established in 1915 Category:Political parties in the Russian Empire Category:Political parties of the Russian Revolution ","title":"Progressive Bloc (Russia)"},{"id":"9420578","text":"Garden of the Purple Dragon is a children's fantasy novel by Carole Wilkinson, published in September 2005 by Macmillan Publishers. It is the second in the Dragonkeeper series and the predecessor to Dragon Moon. It is set in ancient China, during the Han Dynasty, and continues the story of Ping, slave girl turned dragonkeeper. Plot Ping is living on the top of Tai Shan mountain trying to raise Kai, Danzi's son. Ping learns that Kai can shape-change and turns into firstly a soup ladle. They are living happily until one day, their goat is found with its throat slit. Hua also returns to Ping on a red phoenix's back. Ping and Kai flee but they run into the necromancer. After Hua uses his newfound powers to hold off the necromancer while Ping and Kai escape, Ping, Kai and Hua are later captured by guards and taken to Liu Che, Emperor of China, and Ping's 'friend' who drops all charges against them. Ping stays in the palace and meets Princess Yangxin and the two become friends, and the Princess begins to teach Ping how to read and write, since she is unable to do so already. Ping eventually convinces the Emperor to search for any other Dragon Keepers, as she hopes to find her family. She, Kai and Dong Fang Suo (Fatso as Kai had begun to call him) go to a village in search of the next Dragon Keeper. But they do not find Ping's family there, instead, a boy named Jun is taken to be instructed as a Dragonkeeper. Ping becomes jealous when Kai seems to prefer Jun over her. During the journey back to the palace, Ping is nearly killed in an accident and left for dead, but she survives and finds her real family. After staying with them for a short time, she decides to return to the palace for Kai. However the Necromancer is there, bleeding Kai. They duel and Ping, without Kai, escapes to warn the Emperor who reveals he is in league with the Necromancer. She is stripped of her position as Imperial Dragonkeeper and taken off to be sacrificed. During the sacrifice, Dong Fang Suo, Jun, Hua and Kai come to her aid and they defeat the necromancer though Dong Fang Suo is sadly killed (who says it was the Emperor who ordered him and the necromancer to make the accident that almost killed Ping before he dies). While Jun takes his body away, Ping and Kai (Ping had let Hua go free with other rats) escape with Princess Yangxin, who asks them to go with her to the Duke's at the Kunlun Mountains, and the two agree, hoping to find a place to live in safety from the Empire.

Travelling in this direction the principal hills are Kirk Fell, Pillar, Scoat Fell, Haycock and Caw Fell. Haycock sends out a long southern ridge terminating in Seatallan and Seatallan in turn has a south eastern spur. This is Middle Fell. Middle Fell begins at the unnamed col on the eastern face of Seatallan at a height of 1,525 ft. This is its only connection with other high ground, being constrained on three sides by deep valleys. To the west, separating Middle Fell from its parent, is Greendale Gill. This begins at Greendale Tarn, nestled into the steep face of Middle Fell. The tarn, around 30 ft deep, sits in a long narrow bowl, looked down on by a collection of huge boulders.Blair, Don: Exploring Lakeland Tarns: Lakeland Manor Press (2003): To the east is Nether Beck, flowing down to the Lake through its long valley. On the other side are the long southern slopes of Red Pike. The southern slopes of Middle Fell fall to the shore of Wastwater, claiming a long section of the northern shore between Nether Beck Bridge and the Greendale road junction. Goat Gill and Smithy Beck provide further drainage on this side. Middle Fell is steep on all sides. The western face is rough with areas of scree and boulders, but generally free of crags. The longer eastern slopes by contrast have tier upon tier of rocks. Long, Water, Goat, Foegill and Iron Crags are the principal features. The ridge northward to Seatallan is broad, levelling out onto grass after an initial rough descent. Geology The summit area is composed of the dacitic, welded lapilli tuff of the Lincomb Tarns Formation. Andesitic lapilli tuff occurs on either end of the ridge, together with small intrusions of basalt and dolerite. Underlying this is the Birker Fell Formation of plagioclase-phyric andesite lavas.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 38: BGS (1998) Summit The summit cairn is sited on a small rock outcrop, close to the beginning of the ridge-end descent to the south. The view across Wastwater to the screes of Whin Rigg and Illgill Head is excellent. Also in view is the head of Wasdale and the more distant Coniston Fells. Black Combe appears far off to the south west. Ascents The simplest ascent is via a path up the nose of the ridge, beginning at Greendale. A longer alternative climbs the beck to Greendale Tarn before doubling back to the summit along the Seatallan ridge.

He was the head of the Central Economic Mathematical Institute (CEMI) in Moscow from 1963 to 1985. Biography Fedorenko graduated from Moscow Institute of Fine Chemical Technologies. His name is associated with an economic planning methodology used in the former Soviet Union and known as the System of Optimal Functioning of the Economy (SOFE). During the Soviet period SOFE was a controversial approach using mathematical planning methods in order to improve the central planning system. These methods were based on the idea of linear programming or \\"optimal planning\\", associated with L.V. Kantorovich. The SOFE approach was sharply criticized by Soviet economists such as Bojarskij, who was a Soviet mathematical economist (see Pekka Sutela (1984), p.95). Many of them saw the mathematical methods as being too close to Western economic approaches. They were afraid that Soviet political economic theory would disappear behind the mathematical formulas, and that the Soviet economic theory would finally be assimilated into Western economic theory, which also uses well known mathematical formulas in microeconomics, macroeconomic, game theory, distribution theory and others.. M. Bor and S. Logvinov wrote in an article in the GOSPLAN (the former Soviet planning authority's) journal, that SOFE had to be condemned as: \\"an attempt to introduce a special concept of 'optimal planning', calculated to supplant the supposedly non-scientific system of empirical planning; striving to unite vulgar utility theory with the labour theory of value, to present price as a measure of utility; ignoring the principle of democratic centralism as the basis of the socialist theory, exchanging it for the so-called principle of hierarchical structure; borrowing notions from bourgeois theories (marginal utility theory, the notion of market socialism and the theory of factors of production, the ideal of automatic regulation of the socialist economy by 'optimal plan prices'); denying the laws of reproduction; and gradually exchanging the Marxist-Leninist theory of reproduction for the bourgeois theory of equilibrium\\". (see M. Bor and S. Logvinov (1975), quoted by Pekka Sutela (1991), p. 87) Another Soviet planning economist N.Baibakov regarded SOFE as a suspect theoretical construct. (see N. Baibakov (1974), quoted by Sutela Pekka pp.86) An innovative feature of the SOFE approach was its vision of connecting together the different levels of the national economy with computers, which would carry out the calculation of the mathematical planning formulas. This was a precursor of the use of the internet. The idea of using mathematical planning methods and computers remains valid even in today's globalized economy. Despite all ideological attacks Fedorenko remained in his position in CEMI. A Doctor of Economic Sciences, he also was an Honorary Director of CEMI since 1992, a member of the American Econometric Society (from 1966), a member of the International Economical Society (from 1967) and an Honorary Director of the Warsaw School of Planning and Statistics. He wrote several books about optimal planning and SOFE, mostly in Russian, some translated into English.

Fashion victims are \\"victims\\" because they are vulnerable to faddishness and materialism, two of the widely recognized excesses of fashion, and consequently are at the mercy of society's prejudices or of the commercial interest of the fashion industry, or of both. According to Versace, \\"When a woman alters her look too much from season to season, she becomes a fashion victim.\\"  Faddishness  A fad is an intense but short-lived fashion trend. Fads are also by their nature at the extreme range of currently acceptable style, which means they commonly cross the line from the sublime to the ridiculous. Fashion victims can be seen to have crossed this line.  Materialism  Keeping up with fashion is often very expensive. Expensive clothes signal that the wearers are financially successful, but they aren't necessarily \\"cool\\" or \\"fashionable\\".Michelle Lee notes that in order to appear casually well-dressed, shoppers pay extra for designers to \\"sew on decorative patches, slash gaping holes into the knees of jeans and fray the hems.\\" Designer labels have come to form an important part of identification of style and fashion. Many have become accustomed to the social acceptance that comes with wearing the right brands. The labels have in many cases migrated from the inside of a garment to the outside. Common examples of this type of branding are Adidas, Kelme, and other sports and leisurewear manufacturers. A fashion victim, able to recognise this phenomenon but unable to determine its boundary, may become a \\"walking billboard\\". Designer branding is sometimes associated with a higher quality of manufacture and a higher price. The ownership and display of such products of quality is frequently marketed to suggest that the wearer will automatically embody a personal characteristic of quality by association. Designers have identified this and in some cases are able to exploit it to the extent that prices can be escalated to surprising proportions without reference to the cost of manufacture. Extreme examples of this type of branding are found among accessory manufacturers such as Versace, Gucci and Burberry, scent manufacturers such as Chanel and Guerlain and watch manufacturers such as Rolex and Bulgari. Fashion victims, by their characteristic inability to recognize boundaries, may aspire to the extreme end of what is available, seeking expensive products (or copies of these products), believing that the outward display of such items will draw admiration in proportion to their actual or apparent cost. Because of this, \\"the term 'fashion victim' became the ultimate insult to the aspirational.\\" See also *Fast fashion References Further reading * Fashion Victims: The True Cost of Cheap Clothes at Primark, Asda and Tesco (2006) in conjunction with War On Want and Alternative Movement for Resources and Freedom Society (AMRF).

It is a parody of the traditional American Western. In an interview, Bozzetto claimed to have invented the Spaghetti Western genre with this film, an achievement usually attributed to Sergio Leone with his A Fistful of Dollars which was released the year before, but whose development started later and was faster than the traditionally animated West and Soda. Plot The plot of the film follows the traditional stranger arriving in a small western town. The stranger finds a pretty woman holding out from selling her uniquely green land to the local big shot, who is harassing her in hope of seducing her/buying her land. There is an ongoing mystery about how the stranger got a hold of the gold nugget he possesses, though at the end of the film it is revealed that he found it in a soap box (it is fake).

In June 2018, T-Systems announced it will cut 10,000 jobs in 3 years, including 6,000 in Germany, with the hope of returning the company to profitability. History T-Systems was founded in 2000, when Deutsche Telekom acquired a 50.1% stake of debis Systemhaus, one of the largest IT services companies in Germany at the time. Most of Deutsche Telekom's existing service and IT businesses were then merged and incorporated under the control of one single company, the newly founded T-Systems. In 2001 T-System's headquarters were moved from Bonn to Frankfurt. In 2002 the remaining 49.9% share of debis Systemhaus was acquired and fully incorporated into T-Systems. However, the company underwent a leadership crisis during the first years after its creation, due to different agendas of the former debis management and the leadership of the former Telekom subsidiaries. Since then, T-Systems made a number of acquisitions, most notably the purchase of gedas, the IT subsidiary of Volkswagen Group in December 2005. From 2007 to 2018, Reinhard Clemens was T-Systems' CEO. T-Systems also supported the creation of Silicon Saxony, a major IT cluster in Germany. In 2008 T-Systems and global IT services provider, Cognizant, entered into a global alliance.

The collaboration began in 1982 and ended on March 31, 2015, with Fender's launch of Fender Music Corporation (Japan) taking over the Japanese business effective April 1, 2015 with a Fender-manufactured product line. The Japanese-made Fender guitars sold by Fender Music Corporation (Japan) have since been categorized as the \\"Japan Exclusive\\" series. History In the late 1970s, Fender was facing competition from lower-priced Japanese-made guitars. The higher-priced Fender guitars were made in the United States and could not compete directly with Japanese-made Fender copies. In Japan, Fender was also losing sales to Japanese guitar brands such as Tōkai, Greco and Fernandes. Since Japanese labor and production costs were much lower than in the United States, Fender moved the lower-priced Fender guitar production to Japan and began negotiations with several Japanese musical instrument distributors. In March 1982, Fender Japan, Ltd. was officially established as a joint venture between Fender, and . Kanda Shokai is a musical instrument wholesaler that does not own any retail outlets of its own. Kanda Shokai also owns the brand name, Greco. One of the conditions in the Fender Japan agreement was that Kanda Shokai cease production of its Greco Fender copies. Yamano is another musical instrument wholesaler/retailer with its own retail outlets and was once a part of the Orville by Gibson venture. Neither company manufactures guitars, instead ordering them from Japanese guitar factories and distribute them through retail outlets. Yamano distributes through its own retail outlets and also various other retail outlets, while Kanda Shokai distributes through various retail outlets, including the Ishibashi chain of music stores in Japan. The Japanese guitar factories that produced Fender Japan guitars at various times were FujiGen Gakki, Tōkai Gakki and Dyna Gakki. Manufacturers At the beginning of the Fender Japan venture, Tokai was seriously being considered as the manufacturer, but after a breakdown in negotiations, FujiGen Gakki was chosen instead. Some FujiGen-made Fender Japan models between 1982 and 1996 have necks made by Atlansia. Tōkai Gakki and Dyna Gakki took over the manufacture of the Fender Japan models in 1996/1997. The Tōkai-made Fender Japan guitars were not exported, but some of the Dyna-made Fender Japan guitars were. Dyna Gakki have made various guitars for Kanda Shokai's Greco brand. Terada made the Fender Japan acoustic guitars such as the Fender Catalina. =\\"Made in Japan\\" and \\"Crafted in Japan\\"= MADE IN JAPAN serial number Crafted in Japan serial number * \\"Made in Japan\\" = FujiGen Gakki * \\"Crafted in Japan\\" = Others (Tōkai Gakki, Dyna Gakki) According to a Fender representative, it was stipulated in the Fender Japan contract that if there was a change of manufacturer from FujiGen Gakki to another guitar factory, the production inscription in the guitar would be changed from \\"Made in Japan\\" (MIJ) to \\"Crafted in Japan\\" (CIJ). Most of the Japanese-made Fenders up until 1996/1997 were MIJ Fenders. The first CIJ Fenders started around 1992, when Dyna Gakki took over some of the production requirements of Fender Japan. This resulted in the \\"Crafted in Japan\\" inscription appearing on some Japanese Fenders during this period. Dyna took over because FujiGen was expanding its own factory operations. CIJ was used entirely on Japanese Fenders produced from 1996/1997 until 2015, after Tōkai and Dyna took over the Fender Japan manufacturing contract. The Fender Squier range was also brought in line with the Japanese Fenders at around the same time (1996/1997), with the CIJ inscription being used. Timeline 1982: Fender Japan starts production with FujiGen Gakki having the manufacturing contract. The \\"Made in Japan\\" (MIJ) logo is used. 1984: CBS sells Fender to its current owners and while waiting for a new US factory to begin production, Fender Japan models and leftover US stock were mostly sold in the US for a few years. 1993: The first \\"Crafted in Japan\\" (CIJ) models start appearing due to Dyna Gakki taking over some of the manufacturing while FujiGen Gakki were expanding their operations. 1996/1997: \\"Crafted in Japan\\" (CIJ) is used instead of \\"Made in Japan\\" (MIJ) because Tōkai Gakki and Dyna Gakki take over the manufacturing contract from FujiGen Gakki. 2015: Fender, Yamano and Kanda Shokai end the Fender Japan joint venture on March 31, 2015. Fender took over the Japanese business effective April 1, 2015.

It is also known as for being one of the oldest existing units within Polri. Some of its main duties are counter- terrorism, riot control, high-risk law enforcement where the use of firearms are present, search and rescue, hostage rescue, and bomb disposal operations. The Mobile Brigade Corps is a large component of the Indonesian National Police trained for counter-separatist and counter-insurgency duties, often in conjunction with military operations. The Mobile Brigade is also known as the special \\"anti-riot\\" branch of the Indonesian National Police which deals with special operations. A paramilitary organization, its training and equipment is almost identical to the Indonesian Army's (\\"TNI-AD\\"), and it conventionally operates under joint military command in areas such as Papua and, until 2005, Aceh. History Formed in late 1945 as a special police corps named Pasukan Polisi Istimewa (Special Police Troops) with the task of disarming remnants of the Japanese Imperial Army and protecting the chief of state and the capital city. Under the Japanese, it was called . It fought in the revolution and was the first military unit to engage in the Battle of Surabaya under the command of Police Inspector Moehammad Jasin. On 14 November 1946, Prime Minister Sutan Sjahrir reorganised the Polisi Istimewa into the Mobile Brigade (Mobrig). This day is celebrated as the anniversary of this Blue Beret Corps. This Corps was reconstituted to suppress military and police conflicts and even coups d'etat. On 1 December 1947 Mobrig was militarized and later deployed in various conflicts and confrontations like the PKI Rebellion in Madiun, DI Rebellion (1947), APRA Rebellion and RMS Proclamation (1950), PRRI People Rebellion (1953), and Permesta (1958). As of 14 November 1961, the Mobrig changed its name to Korps Brigade Mobil (Brimob), and its troops took part in the military confrontation with Malaysia in the early 1960s and in the conflict in East Timor in the mid-1970s. After that, Brimob was placed under the command of the Indonesian National Police. The Mobile Brigade, which began forming in late 1946 and was used during the anti-Dutch Revolution, started sending students for US Army SF training on Okinawa in January 1959. In April 1960 a second contingent arrived for two months of Ranger training. By the mid-1960s the three-battalion Mobile Brigade, commonly known as Brimob, had been converted into an elite shock force. A Brimob airborne training centre was established in Bandung. Following the 1965 coup attempt, one Brimob battalion was used during anti-Communist operations in West Kalimantan. In December 1975 a Brimob battalion was used during the East Timor operation. During the late 1970s, Brimob assumed VIP security and urban anti-terrorist duties. In 1989, Brimob still contained airborne-qualified elements. Pelopor ('Ranger') and airborne training takes place in Bandung and at a training camp outside Jakarta.Kenneth Conboy, Simon McCouaig South-East Asian Special Forces, D3 Lieutenant, BRIMOB, 1983. Osprey, 1991 Historically, Brimob wore the Indonesian spot camouflage pattern during the early 1960s as their uniform. In 1981, the Mobile Brigade spawned a new unit called the \\"Jihandak\\" (Penjinak Bahan Peledak), an explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) unit. Task The Implementation and mobilization of the Brimob Corps is to cope with high-level interruption of society mainly: mass riots, organized crime armed with fire, search and rescue, explosives, chemicals, biological and radioactive threats along with other police operational implementing elements in order to realize legal order and peace of society throughout juridical of Indonesia and other tasks assigned to the corps. =Qualifications= The Pelopor qualifications, which are the basic capabilities of every Brimob member, are the following basic skills: # Ability to navigate with map and compass # Intelligence # Anti- terror (counter-terrorism) # Riot control # Guerrilla war, Close / Urban war tactics # Bomb disposal # Handle high intensity crimes where the use of firearms is present # Search and rescue # Surveillance, disguise and prosecution. # Other individual and unit capabilities.

Organisation A Brimob Headquarters in Pekanbaru, Riau Brimob personnel In 1992 the Mobile Brigade was essentially a paramilitary organisation trained and organised along military lines. It had a strength of about 12,000. The brigade was used primarily as an elite unit for emergencies and supporting police operations as a rapid response unit. The unit was mainly deployed for domestic security and defense operations, but now has gained and achieved many specialties in the scope of policing duties such as implementing SWAT operations, Search and Rescue operations, Riot control and CBR (Chemical, biological and radiological) defense. Brimob also are usually sent to do domestic security operations with the TNI. Since the May 1998 upheaval, PHH (Pasukan Anti Huru- Hara, Anti Riot Unit) have received special anti-riot training. Elements of the unit are cross trained for airborne and Search and Rescue operations. In each Police HQ that represents a province (which is known as POLDA) in Indonesia must have a BRIMOB force which consists of several Detachments of Pelopor and usually 1 - 2 detachment of GEGANA. The Chief of the Indonesian National Police, known as KAPOLRI, has the highest command in each police operation including BRIMOB, orders are delivered by the police chief and then executed by his Operational Assistant Agent with then further notification to the Corps Commandant and then to the concerned regional commanders. =Units= * Corps HQ and HQ Services ** Brimob Corps Training School ** I (1st) Gegana Unit ** II (2nd) Pelopor Regiment ** III (3rd) Pelopor Regiment =Pelopor= Pelopor troops Pelopor (lit.\\"Pioneer\\") is the main reaction force of the Mobile Brigade Corps, it acts as a troop formation and has the roles such as mainly riot control and conducts paramilitary operations assigned to the corps to cope with high-level threat of society disturbance. It also specializes in the field of Guerrilla, and Search and Rescue (SAR) operations. There are two national regiments of Pelopor in the Brimob corps which are: *II Pelopor Regiment *III Pelopor Regiment In a historical view, this unit was called as \\"Brimob Rangers\\" during the Post Independence era. In 1959, during its first formation, Brimob Rangers troops conducted a test mission in the area of Cibeber, Ciawi and Cikatomas which borders Tasikmalaya- Garut in West Java. In this assignment they often faced the inhibition by the gang of DI / TII in large quantities, guerrilla anti-guided techniques tested in this test mission. The official first assignment of Brimob Rangers was the Fourth Military Operations Movement in South Sumatra, West Sumatra and North Sumatra (in response to the Permesta rebellion of 1958). In this GOM IV Brimob Rangers troops became part of the Bangka Belitung Infantry Battalion led by Lieutenant Colonel (Inf) Dani Effendi. Rangers were tasked to capture the remains of the PRRI prison in Sumatra's forest led by Major Malik, which was then under rebel hands. In 1961 precisely at the time of the Chief of Police General Soekarno Djoyonegoro, Brimob Rangers troops were officially renamed Pelopor Troops of the Mobile Brigade. This is in accordance with the wishes of President Soekarno who wanted Indonesian names for units within both the TNI (Indonesian National Armed Forces) and POLRI (Indonesian National Police). At this time also the Pelopors received many brand new weapons for police operations, including the more famous AR-15 assault rifles. The subsequent assignment of this force was to infiltrate West Irian in Fak-Fak in May 1962 and engage in combat with the servicemen of the Royal Netherlands Army. The troops were also involved in the Confrontation of Malaysia in 1964 and at that time the Brimob Rangers troops (now Pelopor) in Indonesia faced the British Special Air Service. Now the Pelopor Troops plays a role as a troop formation unit and is still active in the Brimob's operational system. Aside from the national regiments, each Police region has a Pelopor regiment of two to four battalions. =Gegana= Gegana Bomb Disposal Gegana is a special branch detachment within the Brimob corps which have special abilities mainly in bomb disposal and counter-terrorist operations. On the other hand, it also specializes in the field of hostage rescue, intelligence and CBR (Chemical, biological and radiological) defense. It has 5 (five) detachments which are: *Intelligence Detachment *Bomb Disposal Detachment *Anti-Terror Detachment *Anti-Anarchist Detachment *CBR (Chemical, biological and radiological) Detachment This unit was formed in 1976 as a detachment. At first, it was meant to deal with aircraft hijacking. Later in 1995, with the expansion of Brimob, the Gegana Detachment was expanded to become the 2nd BRIMOB Regiment. However, there are a select few specialists who are very skilled in these specialties. Gegana does not have battalions or companies. The regiment is broken down into several detachments. Within each detachment they are split into sub-detachments (sub-den), and within each sub-den they are further sub- divided into several units. Each unit usually consists of 10 personnel. One sub-den consists of 40 personnel, and one detachment consists of about 280 personnel. One operation is usually assigned to one unit. Therefore, from the 10 people in that unit, six are required to have special skills: two for EOD (Explosives and Ordnance Disposal), two for search and rescue operations, and two for counter-terrorist operations. In any operation, two experts are designated Operators One and Two while the rest of the unit members become the Support Team. For example, in counter-terrorism operations, the designated Operators must have sharp-shooting skills, ability to negotiate, and be an expert in storm-and-arrest procedures. These skills and operations are not meant to be lethal because the main goal of every Gegana operation is to arrest suspects and bring them to the court. Unless there is a situation that Gegana has to do otherwise, there will be no shooting. In Search and Rescue operations, the personnel are required to have the basic capabilities of diving, rappelling, shooting, and first aid. In anti-bomb operation, the Operators have to be the expert in their respective fields. Each Gegana personnel has been introduced to various types of bombs in general, including the risks of handling them. There are specific procedures for handling each bomb, including the required timing. Currently, Gegana has three Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) tactical vehicles. =Unit composition= Brimob units are present in all 34 Regional Police Headquarters (Polda) in Indonesia which represent a province. In each BRIMOB unit of a Police HQ in a province (Polda), there are about several detachments of MBC Pelopor units (organized into a regiment) and usually 1 - 2 detachment of Gegana (small battalions or companies). A Brimob unit of a regional police headquarters consists of the following: #Regional Mobile Brigade HQ Section (Si-yanma) #Planning and Administration Section (Subbagrenmin) #Intelligence Section (Si-intel) #Operational Section (Si-ops) #Provost (Internal affairs) Section (Si-provos) #Communications Technology Section (Si-tekkom) #Medical and Fitness Section (Si-kesjas) #Search and Rescue (SAR) Unit #Pelopor Regiment composed of: ## Regional Pelopor Regimental HQ ##A Detachment (Den-A) ##B Detachment (Den-B) ##C Detachment (Den-C) ##D Detachment (Den-D) (large departments only) ## Support units #Gegana Detachment (Den Gegana) ## Detachment HQ ## 1-3 Subdetachments/Platoons For some regional police headquarters, Pelopor detachments only consists up-to \\"C\\" Detachments only (3 battalions each). But for bigger regional police HQs such as the Jakarta Regional Metropolitan Police (Polda Metro Jaya), it consists up-to \\"D\\" Detachment with a total of four (4) detachments. Each Pelopor Detachment consists of 4 (four) Companies, and each Company consists of 3 (three) Platoons. The Gegana detachment is organized as a company in most police regions, but in larger ones is organized as a full battalion of two detachments and a headquarters unit.

The Maximalists officially split off from the PSR at its Second Congress in Imatra in 1906. Maximalists played a role in both the Revolution of 1905 and the Revolution of 1917. Many former SR Maximalists eventually joined the Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik). Ideology and history Maximalists were so called because they demanded the full implementation of the 'maximum programme' in the expected revolution: full socialisation of the land, factories and all other means of production. The orthodox Socialist-Revolutionaries wanted to start with land reform but defer socialisation of other means of production. The Maximalists also rejected the PSR's version of a 'two-stage' revolution, a theory associated with V.M. Chernov. According to Chernov, the coming revolution in Russia would not be purely 'bourgeois-democratic' as the Social-Democrats claimed, but would include social and economic as well as political reforms. It would be a 'popular-democratic' revolution, and would transition into a full-blown 'labour-socialist' revolution later on. The Maximalists rejected this as Social-Democratic 'attentism' and argued that the coming Russian revolution would not be able to stop half-way; it was the two-stage theory, not Maximalism, that was unrealistic if it thought the toiling masses, once liberated, would content themselves with a bourgeois republic and gradual reforms. The SR Maximalists also had a much more favourable view of terror and expropriation. Before the Azef scandal of 1908, the PSR had endorsed 'political terror', i.e., attacks on state officials and members of the ruling royal family. Many future Maximalists had been involved in such attacks, as well as in 'expropriations' (bank robberies and the like). Such methods had always been controversial in the PSR and were discontinued after Yevno Azef, head of the PSR's 'Combat Organization', was unmasked as a secret police agent. The Maximalists, however, argued for a continuation of 'political terror' and also endorsed 'economic terror', meaning attacks on factory bosses, industrialists, bankers, landowners, etc., or their property. Such actions against 'private' individuals were unacceptable to the orthodox SRs, who denounced them as 'lynch justice'. Meanwhile, on the right, the Popular Socialists who defected from the PSR at the same time as the Maximalists, rejected any terrorism. The Maximalists were often compared to anarchists, with whom they shared a fondness for 'propaganda by the deed' and 'direct action', but they themselves rejected this comparison. They were not opposed to the concept of the state as such and envisaged a popular revolutionary dictatorship. They rejected parliamentary democracy as a mere 'lightning rod of popular discontent' (whereas a parliamentary democracy was one of the cardinal demands of the PSR). The Maximalists claimed that what was needed was a population imbued with a general 'toilers' consciousness' and a small, energetic minority, forming a disciplined secret organisation that would seize power and establish a 'Toilers' Republic'. In these respects, the Maximalists were heirs of Blanqui and Tkachev rather than Bakunin or Kropotkin. (They also foreshadowed future currents and methods in Leninism.J.V. Stalin's role in the early Bolshevik party included 'expopriations' modelled on the Maximalists' methods. Lenin, in 1905, began to argue for a 'democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and the peasantry', represented by the Bolsheviks and the left wing of the PSR and the SR Maximalists, respectively. By contrast, the Mensheviks were then pursuing an alliance with the liberal bourgeoisie.) The Maximalists boycotted elections to the tsarist State Duma. Prominent Maximalists included E.Iu. Lozinsky (pseudonym 'Ustinov', a former contributor to the PSR's journal Revolutionary Russia, M.I. Sokolov, D.V. Vinogradov, V. Mazurin, M.M. Engelgard (Alexandrovich) and others. Lozinsky was one of the Maximalists' leading theorists and editor of Volniy Disskussioniy Listok (Free Discussion Reader), the group's journal. Sokolov, a charismatic peasant organiser and experienced bank robber and extortionist, was the principal leader of the group and was accepted as a 'born dictator' by his followers. The Maximalists initially received some support from established Socialist- Revolutionary leaders like Ekaterina Breshkovskaya and N.I. Rakitnikov (Maximov), but ultimately, the differences between Maximalism and orthodox Socialist-Revolutionary ideology were too great. In 1906–07, the 'Union of Socialist-Revolutionary Maximalists' (SSRM) was founded as an independent political party. In theory it was devoted to revolutionary agitation among workers and peasants for an immediate socialist revolution; in practice, much of its energy was directed to fundraising by criminal means and to violence against state officials, capitalists and landowners. In the aftermath of the failed Revolution of 1905–07, the Maximalists were decimated by arrests, but with difficulty they remained in existence as a distinct revolutionary current until 1917, when they participated in the soviets. Always more given to 'action' than to 'theory', the Maximalists soon splintered; some allied with the Left SRs, others joined the Bolsheviks (who had shed their attachment to the Social-Democratic 'two-stage' theory and were in the process of establishing a radical revolutionary dictatorship of sorts). Some Maximalists, however, opposed the Bolsheviks and engaged in anti-Bolshevik actions during the Civil War.

It is headquartered in Kaohsiung, with shipyards in Kaohsiung and Keelung. It was a state-owned enterprise before privatization via an IPO in 2008. History CSBC Corporation, Taiwan is the result of the merger of Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation and China Shipbuilding Corporation. Taiwan Shipbuilding began in 1937 during the Japanese colonial period when Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Corporation founded the Taiwan Dockyard Corporation. Following Japan's defeat in World War II, the Republic of China authorities established Taiwan Machinery and Shipbuilding Company by merging the existing Taiwan Dockyard Corporation with Taiwan Steel Works and Tōkō Kōgyō Corporation. Two years later, in 1948, the company split into two state- owned companies called Taiwan Machinery Corporation and Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation (TSBC). China Shipbuilding Corporation (CSBC) was founded in 1973 and reverted to a government-owned company in 1977. CSBC and TSBC merged in 1978 and was known as China Shipbuilding Corporation until 2007. On 9 February 2007, the board approved the name change to Taiwan Shipbuilding Corporation with immediate effect, with a ceremony to take place on February 12 to commemorate the name change. Critics argued that the name change was another case of President Chen's desinicization act, while proponents argued that the name change would help to avoid potential confusion with China. In 2008 CSBC’s production value reached 1.131b USD, 54% of Taiwan’s total shipbuilding industry output for that year. According to its website, the company has built container ships, one-of-a-kind commercial ships and semi-submersible heavy- lift transport ships, including the . Furthermore, it has built ships, submarines and advanced naval weapons for the Republic of China Navy, patrol vessels for the Coast Guard Administration (Taiwan), and research vessels for the Taiwan Ocean Research Institute. CSBC is participating in the development of the first domestic Taiwanese AUV. In 2018 CSBC entered into an alliance with Yang Ming Marine Transport Corporation, Taiwan Navigation Co Ltd, and Taiwan International Ports Corporation to provide marine services to Taiwan's burgeoning offshore wind power sector. CSBC has a joint venture with DEME Wind Engineering to offer wind farm construction in East Asia. In 2019 they were hired by Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners to transport and install wind turbines at two new wind farm off Taiwan. The two wind farms have a combined capacity of 600MW and are expected to be completed by 2023. CSBC has been contracted to build eight conventional attack submarines for the Republic of China Navy. The model featured an X-form rudder. The initial project contract is for US$3.3 billion with projected procurement costs of US$10bn for a fleet of ten boats. CSBC is set to deliver ten 2,800 TEU container vessels to Yang Ming Marine Transport Corporation between January 2020 and February 2021. In July 2019 CSBC launched the CSBC No. 15, a barge designed to support CSBC’s offshore wind power business. The barge has a loading capacity of 23,000 metric tons and a loading deck bearing strength 20 metric tons per square meter. It is 41 meters wide by 140 meters long and cost NT$700 million to build.

After the death of Japaneseman Giichi Okumura on October 13, 2007, he was also the 12th-oldest living man in the world. After his death, de Cazenave was succeeded as the oldest living Frenchman as well as French veteran of World War I by Italian-born Lazare Ponticelli, who was two months younger and died only two months later, on March 12, 2008. Two further French veterans, 108-year-old Fernand Goux and 109-year-old Pierre Picault who were the oldest living Frenchmen after Ponticelli's death as well as the last living Frenchmen born before 1900, died later in November 2008, but neither was officially recognized as the last French veteran of the war by the government of France because they served fewer than three months. Biography Louis de Cazenave was born and raised in Saint-Georges-d'Aurac in the Auvergne region of south central France. When he turned nineteen years old, at the end of 1916, he was mobilized into the military. He found himself in various units before being assigned to the colonial infantry front in the 5th Senegalese Tirailleur Battalion and fought in the Battle of Chemin des Dames. At the end of the war, de Cazenave returned to Haute-Loire and married in 1920 to Marie, a postmistress with whom he had three sons. He became a railwayman, joining the predecessor to the SNCF. His experiences led him to become a convinced pacifist; later on, he participated in the strikes and demonstrations of the Popular Front in 1936 before going into retirement in 1941. During the Nazi occupation of France, he subscribed to the banned Marxist socialist journal La Patrie Humaine and was imprisoned by the Vichy regime. Although at first refusing any decorations, de Cazenave accepted the Légion d’honneur in 1995, along with several other veterans. He died at his family home in Brioude at age 110.

The film also featured Vivek, Urvashi and Rekha Vedavyas in supporting roles, while Karthik Raja composed the music and Rajarajan handled the camera. The film took two years to complete production and the eventual delayed release was met with a poor response from critics and didn't make an impact at the box office. Plot The movie is an action-adventure inspired by Charlie's Angels. Charu, Nandhu and Pooja are friends who study music abroad. On their return they get embroiled in a case involving their friend Asha, who travels with her lover to Chennai from Dubai on a false passport. She is imprisoned and the three girls garner support for Asha who would be executed if sent back to Dubai.

Parameswaran was signed as director. Initially the producers had approached Simran to play one of the lead roles, though the actress rejected the opportunity after completing the photoshoots for the movie. After much media speculation, the film began its first schedule on 21 November 2001 in Chennai with the producers also revealing they managed to rope in leading Hindi actor Govinda to make a guest appearance in the film. He shot for a song in Chennai. Reports also suggested that Arjun would play a supporting role in the film, although claims proved to be untrue. During the shoot of the film, there was reportedly a clash of opinions between actresses Jyothika and Laila in January 2002, with the pair having to be restrained by the actress-producer of the film, Rambha. Problems continued as the careers of Laila and Rambha began to peter out, prompting distributors to back away from the film, leading to further delays. Prior to release, the team of the film collaborated with prominent tea brand, 3 Roses, for their media campaign. The brand is referenced in the film. Release The film evaded its release date several times and eventually took close to two years to complete, only finally releasing on 10 October 2003. The film gained negative reviews with Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu citing that \\"a frivolous storyline, a lackadaisical approach to the screenplay and inept direction mar Three Roses\\", adding that \\"after all the hype and hoopla, speculation and delay, arrives Three Roses, and ironically it is focus that the film lacks.\\" Another critic claimed that \\"the disastrous effects all these problems (changes in cast, production delays) have had on the movie is clearly evident from the final product.\\" Rambha suffered losses from the film and fell heavily into debt, being forced to sell her home at Mount Road, Chennai to pay off loans taken. A check bounce case was filed against her as she borrowed a huge amount of money and failed to return it. The failure of the film also led to Rambha taking an extended break from Tamil language films.

In the 21st century they are fast disappearing from the American landscape in places where they were once ubiquitous. U.S. States, such as Maryland, have sponsored programs which discourage the cultivation of tobacco. In 2001 Maryland's state sponsored program offered cash payments as buyouts to tobacco farmers. A majority of the farmers took the buyout and hundreds of historic tobacco barns were rendered instantly obsolete.Tobacco Barns of Southern Maryland, 11 Most Endangered Places, National Trust for Historic Preservation .

Design Design elements which were common to American tobacco barns include: gabled roofs, frame construction, and some system of ventilation. The venting can appear in different incarnations but commonly hinges would be attached to some of the cladding boards, so that they could be opened. Often the venting system would be more elaborate, including a roof ventilation system. The interior would have its framing set up in bents about ten to fifteen feet apart so that laths with tobacco attached to them could be hung for drying. There is no one design that typifies tobacco barns but they share some common elements not seen in other barns. However, tobacco barns do cross over into other barn styles of their day.

Hop barns were so common it was said that \\"every other farm\\" had one. In New York state's \\"hop belt\\" numerous hop barns were constructed between the early 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century.

Defunct hop kilns are found in areas where hops production is still ongoing, in Kent, England, for instance. Design The design of hop houses changed significantly over time, as did the area hops were grown in. In New York, for instance, early hop barns were low with some ventilation. Later hop barns evolved into taller, more narrow buildings, often topped with a cupola over the drying kiln area. Later in the history of New York hops production, with farmers focused on more efficient means of production, pyramid shaped barns were built, eventually evolving into multi-pyramid hop barns. =Potato barns and houses= Barns designed to store potatoes are semi-subterranean (partially below ground) to naturally moderate the indoor temperature like a giant root cellar. The potatoes in storage could not be allowed to freeze or get too warm.Harris, Cyril M.. Illustrated dictionary of historic architecture. New York: Dover Publications, 1983, 1977.

They are generally rectangular and do not require exterior walls. The roof is supported by the poles, which make up the perimeter of the barn.Groover, Gordon. Hay Storage Alternatives - Barns , Farm Business Management Update, October - November 2003, Virginia Tech, Cooperative Extension . Retrieved 10 February 2007. Walls may be added to pole barns but are not required for structural integrity. The roof can be gabled or hooped. Pole barns are often used for hay storage or livestock shelter, and larger structures are also used for indoor horse stables and riding arenas. This type of barn is not only very common in modern agriculture but is also used for other applications where large spaces are needed, including boat and truck storage, warehouses, strip malls, retail stores, public exhibit buildings at a fairgrounds, and related uses. Residential garages are also built as pole barns because of their quick construction time and efficient use of materials. The advantages of pole barns include their low cost and their ability to store large quantities of hay or other materials in areas easily accessible by vehicles, machines, and people.Marek, Jennifer. Barns , Center for Great Plains Study , Emporia State University. Retrieved 10 February 2007. In the United Kingdom a pole barn refers to a type of Dutch barn. Design The design of most pole barns is simple. Poles make up the outer walls and support the roof system, usually pre-engineered wood trusses with a roof sheathing. Poles are usually spaced 8' apart, with the trusses bearing directly on the poles. Some variations in design call for truss carrying beams between the posts with trusses sitting on them. The exterior walls consist of girts attached horizontally to the post with the exterior sheathing attached to them. Exterior walls may be finished with corrugated metal, plywood sheathing, vinyl siding, or other cladding. Roof materials are generally corrugated metal but may be finished using any typical roofing product. Depending on the function of the barn, there can be slight differences in style. For instance, a barn used for storing hay may lack any kind of lower exterior wall, whereas a pole barn used to house livestock would have some form of wall meeting the roof.Photographs of pole barns. Various websites. See: , , , , . All Retrieved 10 February 2007. History of Pole Barns In the 1930s, post-frame construction had its start with the development of two key components: availability in rural areas of wood telephone and electricity poles, and corrugated steel sheeting. By using poles embedded in the ground, along with steel roofing and siding, the amount of framing, siding, and foundation material needed to construct a barn was drastically reduced. The columns were literally telephone poles – hence the term 'pole barn'. After World War 2, 'poles' were replaced by solid sawn posts, usually 4×6 or 6×6. The posts were chemically treated to resist decay, greatly increasing the useful life of a building. In the 1950s and 1960s, metal-plate-connected wood trusses were developed, increasing roof spans, eventually up to 100′ (30 m). In the 1970s and 1980s, solid sawn posts were supplemented by laminated 2×6 and 2×8 posts, allowing taller buildings.Cleary Building Corp. \\"Introduction to Post Frame Construction.\\" 2008 Since the 1980s, pole barns have been adapted for a variety of uses, including residential garages, retail stores, light commercial buildings, and professional offices.CB Structures Inc. Pole Barns FAQ What can a pole building be used for? 2010 Corrugated metal is still very common, but other exteriors such as vinyl siding, stucco, and cement board are also used. The National Frame Builders Association is a trade group for the post-frame construction industry. =Rice barns= Rice barns are used ubiquitously in the rice cultivating world for the storage and drying of harvested rice. They are prevalent in many Southeast Asian nations, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Indonesia among them.

Retrieved 8 February 2007. Significance =United States= Barn design, overall, bears architectural, cultural and historical significance, as well as some anthropological and sociological significance. Barn design speaks to two distinct parameters in agricultural history, one being climate and the other being occupation. Different types of barns tell much about what inhabitants of the past cultivated and in what type of climate they did it in. In the United States climate allows regional barn variation to easily be divided along a north/south axis. Design divided along these lines speaks to how farmers responded to the severity of the winter. In the north, where cold, harsh winters are common, buildings were more extensive and spacious, to house animals, crops and vehicles. South and west, in the U.S., where the weather tends to be more mild, barn design focused on smaller more specialized structures such as tobacco barns. It is regional differences in North American climate that produced the major differences in northern and southern American barns. After climatology the biggest factor in barn design is function. All over the United States barn designs, such as those discussed above, were developed based upon the individual needs of specific crops or livestock.

History The airport was established on the former RAF Khormaksar, which opened in 1917 and closed as an RAF station in 1967. It later served as a Soviet Air Force station during the 1970s and 1980s. From 1971 until 1996 it was also the main hub of Alyemda Yemen Democratic Airlines. It is the second- largest airport in Yemen after Sana'a International Airport. The new terminal was built between 1983 and 1985, with a capacity of one million passengers a year. In 2000 the constructions at the new control tower and airport department building were completed. During the Yemeni Civil War in the Aftermath of the Houthi takeover in Yemen, the city of Aden including its airport became a battleground. The Battle of Aden Airport took place on 19 March 2015, with Houthi forces mounting an attack on the airport that was repelled by forces loyal to President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi. Operations were suspended for months, owing to bombing by the Saudi Air Force in Operation Decisive Storm. On 22 July 2015, the airport was declared fit for operation again, as a Saudi plane carrying aid reportedly became the first plane to land in Aden in four months. Two days later two more Saudi planes landed carrying the equipment needed to resume operations, to enable aid to be delivered to the embattled country. On 26 November 2015, the airport re-opened briefly for civilian air traffic after being closed for 10 months, with a Yemenia flight arriving from Amman-Queen Alia international Airport in Jordan. Service for the next three months was sporadic, but at the end of February 2016 it was reported that the airport would reopen for ordinary commercial service after a few weeks of repairs. The blockade was reinstated on 21 February 2016. The blockade was lifted on 14 November 2017, when the first commercial flight has landed at Aden International Airport. Flights were cancelled once again, for four days (28-31 January 2018), but resumed on 1 February 2018. Military usage The airport is also a Yemeni Air Force base. The base is home to the 128 Squadron Detachment. Aircraft attached to the squadron are mainly transport and attack helicopters (Ka27/28, Mi-8, Mi-14, Mi-17, Mi-24, Mi-171Sh).

Historical and Cultural Significance Duro Ladipo’s revolutionary play, Oba Kò So, was first staged in 1963 at the Mbari Mayo Club in Osobgo, Nigera as part of an anniversary celebration for the opening of the city’s arts centre, notably the same year that Nigeria was declared a republic. Not only did Oba Kò So gain national recognition, but it gained international recognition, as the German Cultural Center in Lagos staged it in 1963, prompting its appearance in a cultural festival in Berlin called the Berliner Festwochen in 1964. The reviews of the Berlin audience highly revered its performance, describing it as one of the “great highlights of the festival”. Ladipo’s company was then invited to perform Oba Kò So for the Commonwealth Tour throughout Europe starting in 1965 and continued to perform throughout Europe in addition to being adapted and filmed as a feature of BBC. In 1975, Duro Ladipo sought to extend his international influence and tour in other parts of the Diaspora and America. The tour of Oba Kò So in Brazil is particularly notable due to the immense respect it received, as the Yoruba traditions and mythology connected the audiences to their own living traditions of Santería that have roots in Nigeria. Later in 1975, Oba Kò So toured the United States as part of the Third World Theatre Festival performing in theaters across the country. The Yoruba traditions brought to life on stage represented a new kind of energy and exhilaration that was incomparable to other theater experiences, as audience members described the music and drumming as “vigorous and rich” and the dance as “enervating”. Much of the success of Oba Kò So was in part due to the uniqueness of his creative vision to merge a mythological and human form into the character of Sango, in which Ladipo played himself, as his embodiment of this Yoruba deity reflected a deep personal and cultural connection Ladipo had to the worship of Sango and Yoruba traditions in general. One of main innovations of Oba Kò So was that it departed from the traditional Yoruba folk opera and entered into new postcolonial chapter of Yoruba theater that aimed to reclaim the traditional Yoruba poetry, music and dance rituals that were denounced by the European colonial powers that promoted the retelling of stories from the Bible and Christian traditions. This play served a larger purpose that reflected the personal journey of Duro Ladipo and many others in reconciling the conflicting influences of Christianity enforced by the colonial authority as well as their ancestral roots of Yoruba traditions. Not only did Ladipo set the precedent for new thematic construction in Yoruba theater with Oba Kò So, but the people he chose to work was an act of resistance in itself, as his recruiting process did not revolve around schooling as done under colonial direction, but rather the merit of their contributions to Yoruba art forms. In a way, Ladipo included his actors, dancers, musicians, and singer in the opportunity to rewrite the history of Yoruba culture as they were they were all at the forefront of the creation process, contributing their personal experiences as content for the characters of the play. Background Shango is the protagonist of the play. According to some historians, he reigned as the king of Oyo and was a figure feared by both his subjects and, across the Niger, by the Borgu and Nupe empires. He was known for his warring and tyrannical tendencies during his life, and was later deified in tribal history and worshiped by some. His era was one of turbulence and also of intrigue. Duro Ladipo was influenced by the writings of the Rev. Samuel Johnson, a Yoruba historian who used a lot of old Oyo sources for his book on the Yorubas. Duro's play created the image of Sango as a tragic hero. Plot The play tries to revisit history by portraying a stout and commanding Sango at the height of his powers as a king. Ever mindful of the wishes of the people and in his desire to please them, he set two of his most powerful chiefs against each other. The chiefs, Gbonka and Timi, had grown too powerful and were becoming a nuisance to the kingdom. However, the plot ends up dividing his cabinet and many of his advisers, friends and a wife, Princess Oya, leave him. Shango's friend Mogba, rather than join the traitors, desires to redeem the battered image of the king. Mogba invokes incantations, causing thunder and lightning to damage the homes of Sango's enemies. References *Ogundeji, \\"Philip Adedotun: The Image of Sango in Duro Ladipo's plays\\".

In a book review for The Journal of African History, historian Tony Hopkins wrote, \\"Pakenham has written a book that contributes nothing of significance to our understanding of the scramble. More damagingly, the work perpetuates and popularizes an outdated view of both African and imperial history.\\" According to Hopkins, Pakenham's work is largely based on primary source documents written by the \\"blunderers and plunderers\\" themselves without critical analysis of the accuracy, biases, or self-serving motives of his sources. Hopkins also criticised Pakenham's use of artistic license to make inferences and embellish events without supporting evidence. In 1992, the book won the WH Smith Literary Award and the Alan Paton Award.

In the 21st century they are fast disappearing from the landscape in places where they were once ubiquitous. The barns have declined with the tobacco industry in general, and U.S. States such as Maryland actively discourage tobacco farming. When the US tobacco industry was at its height, tobacco barns were found everywhere the crop was grown. Tobacco barns were as unique as each area in which they were erected, and there is no one design that can be described as a tobacco barn. History The terminology \\"tobacco barn\\" has been used to describe myriad structures in the USA. Buildings used for strictly tobacco curing, buildings that have multiple agricultural uses, and dilapidated barns, among others, have all been called tobacco barns at one time or another. In the Connecticut River Valley (Tobacco Valley) which extends through Connecticut, Massachusetts and up to Vermont, the curing \\"barns\\" are properly called \\"sheds\\" (tobacco sheds). The term \\"barn\\" is exclusively used to refer to structures that house livestock in this area (New England). When referring to any tobacco operation in this area, whether shade or broadleaf, the term \\"shed\\" is the proper term to use. =Design= Interior of an aging tobacco barn in West Virginia Tobacco barn hinge Tobacco leaves drying in a Connecticut barn Though tobacco barn designs varied greatly there were elements that were found in many US tobacco barns. Design elements which were common include: gabled roofs, frame construction, and some system of ventilation. The venting can appear in different incarnations but commonly hinges would be attached to some of the cladding boards, so that they could be opened. Often the venting system would be more elaborate, including a roof ventilation system. In addition, tobacco barns do cross over into other barn styles of their day. Some common types of barn designs integrated into tobacco barns include, English barns and bank barns.Tobacco Barn , Architecture and Landscapes of Agriculture: A Field Guide , Pennsylvania Historical & Museum Commission. Retrieved 10 February 2007. Each farmer has his favorite venting systems that are built not only for the winds but for efficiency. Right after the tobacco is hung, the vents are opened during the day in an effort to begin the important process of shedding water from the tobacco known as the curing of tobacco. Tobacco is often cured at specific temperatures and humidities, depending on where the tobacco is being cured, and also what the finished tobacco leaf is supposed to taste like. Cigar companies each have their own curing \\"recipes.\\" Each leaf loses approximately eighty percent of its own weight by the time the curing process has successfully finished. In the first two weeks of the curing process, about an acre of hanging tobacco loses about five tons of water.Tobacco Sheds of the Connecticut River Valley, Darcy Purinton and Dale F. Cahill. The vents are used to slow the drying process down which allows for a critical chemical break down to occur, turning the leaf from green to yellow to brown. To maintain ideal curing temperatures over the course of the curing process, farmers not only rely on the vents but on heat. While charcoal fires have been replaced in many barns with propane heaters, both methods help reduce moisture. With all of the variables that can impact the curing process, it is no wonder that the unique design of the tobacco barn has remained constant as a time-tested method for drying tobacco. The interior framing would be set up in bents up ten feet, but more often about four feet apart horizontally, so that laths (also called \\"tobacco sticks\\") with tobacco attached to them could be hung for drying. The tier poles were often supported by posts and cross beams, the space in between known as the \\"bents.\\" The bents ranged in vertical spacing from 20 inches to five feet wide. The bent itself became an important earmarker in determining crop volume. Farmers would commonly refer to barn size in terms of bents and the rule of thumb was one bent will hang half an acre of tobacco. In some areas, bents were called \\"rooms,\\" even though this just defined a narrow and tall division of the inside of the barn by the tier poles. In North Carolina, for instance, bents were called rooms, and a typical barn for curing flue cured tobacco was four rooms in size. Current state U.S. states, such as Maryland, have sponsored programs which discourage the cultivation of tobacco. In 2001 Maryland's state-sponsored program offered cash payments as buyouts to tobacco farmers. A majority of the farmers took the buyout, and hundreds of historic tobacco barns were rendered instantly obsolete.Tobacco Barns of Southern Maryland, 11 Most Endangered Places, National Trust for Historic Preservation . Retrieved 10 February 2007. As tobacco barns disappear, farmers have been forced to change their methods for curing the crop. In Kentucky, instead of curing tobacco attached to laths in vented tobacco barns as they once did, farmers are increasingly curing tobacco on \\"scaffolds\\" in the fields.

He was nicknamed \\"Napoleon\\" due to his personality and standing at tall. He is a two time European Pool Championships winner, and one of the most successful players on the Euro Tour, winning four events, and finishing runner-up on twice. Chamat reached the semi-finals of the 2004 WPA World Nine-ball and the 2008 WPA World Eight-ball Championships, but did not reach the final of a world championship event. He first represented Europe at the Mosconi Cup in 2000, and played for the Continent six times. After retiring in 2015, he became the non-playing captain of the side, winning the event in 2015, 2016 and 2017. Career In 2000, Chamat won his first major title by defeating Ralf Souquet in the final of the nine-ball event at the European Pool Championships. He won at the European championships again, this time in the eight-ball event in 2008, defeating Svilar Zoren in the final 8–3. Chamat has also been runner-up at the championships on two further occasions, being defeated in the final of the eight-ball in 2010, and the nine-ball in 2012. Chamat reached the semi-finals of a world championships for the first time in 2004 at the 2004 WPA World Nine-ball Championship. After the preliminary round, Chamat defeated Souquet, Ramil Gallego (both 9–6), Thorsten Schober (11–8), and Marlon Manalo (11–6). Chamat played Chang Pei-Wei in the semi-final, but lost 11–9. He also reached this stage at the 2008 WPA World Eight-ball Championship, defeating Gabriele Cimmino, Kasper Kristoffersen (both 10–5) and Dimitri Jungo (10–6), before losing in the semi-final to Souquet 10–8. Chamat played on the International Pool Tour and, as of 2019, also appears at the Euro Tour events. Chamat is one of the most successful players on the Tour, with four event wins, starting with his first tournament win in 1999, at the Finland Open. He later won three more Euro Tour events, all in Austria in 2004, 2006 and 2009. With four victories overall, he is in the top 10 winners of Euro Tour events. Chamat also won the UPA World Summit of Pool in 2005, defeating Corey Deuel in the finals. Chamat semi-retired from professional pool in 2015, before taking over as captain at the Mosconi Cup. Shortly before this, Chamat reached the last 16 at the 2015 WPA World Ten-ball Championship, losing to Yang Ching-shun 11–8. =Mosconi Cup= Chamat represented Team Europe at the Mosconi Cup six times in (2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005). Despite the American side dominating the event at this time, the European side that Chamat was in won in 2002 was referred to as \\"one of the best moments of [his] career\\", by team-mate Steve Davis. Through this period, Chamat secured 11 victories from 26 matches played at the event. After failing to regain his place on the team in 2006, Chamat continued to play professionally, however, he took over as non-playing captain for Europe at the Mosconi Cup at the 2015 event. Chamat captained the team to three victories at the 2015, 2016 and 2017 events. In his fourth event as captain, he saw a losing effort in 2018, the first USA victory since 2009. During the event, after Joshua Filler put Europe 3–0 ahead, he neglected to shake the hand of his opponent Dennis Hatch, which led to Hatch leaving the arena feeling aggrieved. Chamat, as captain, took Filler to one side to calm the player down. Filler later praised Chamat, saying: \\"He is the best captain.\\" In total, Chamat has represented Europe at the event on ten occasions. Personal life Chamat was born 15 May 1975, in Borlänge, Sweden. He is a co-owner of the Interpool Restaurant and Biljard clubs in Gävle, Uppsala and Malmö, Sweden. The club has become a base for pool in Sweden, and began to run international pool events in 2009, with the interpool open 9-ball starting in 2009. Chamat is nicknamed Napoleon for his attitude whilst playing pool and his diminutive stature, standing at tall.

The Congress was attended by 112 delegates with the right to vote, who represented 57 local Party organisations and 22 delegates with voice but no vote. Other participants were delegates from various national Social- Democratic parties: three each from the Social-Democrats of Poland and Lithuania, the Bund and the Lettish Social Democratic Labour Party, one each from the Ukrainian Social-Democratic Labour Party and the Finnish Labour Party, and also a representative of the Social Democratic Labour Party of Bulgaria. Among the Bolshevik delegates were Vladimir Lenin, Alexander Bogdanov, Leonid Krassin, Mikhail Frunze, Mikhail Kalinin, Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya, Anatoly Lunacharsky, Fyodor Sergeyev (Artyom), S. G. Shaumyan, Ivan Skvortsov-Stepanov, Joseph Stalin, Kliment Voroshilov, Maxim Litvinov and V. V. Vorovsky. The main items on the Congress agenda were the agrarian question, an appraisal of the current situation and the class tasks of the proletariat, the attitude to the Duma, and organisational matters. There was a bitter controversy between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks over every item. Lenin made reports and speeches on the agrarian question, the current situation, and tactics regarding the Duma elections, the armed uprising, and other questions. The preponderance of Mensheviks at the Congress, while slight, determined its character; the Congress adopted Menshevik resolutions on a number of questions (the agrarian programme, the attitude to the Duma, etc.). The Congress approved the first clause of the Rules concerning Party membership in the wording proposed by Lenin. It admitted the Social-Democratic organisations of Poland and Lithuania and the Lettish Social-Democratic Labour Party into the RSDLP, and predetermined the admission of the Bund. The Congress elected a Central Committee of three Bolsheviks and seven Mensheviks, and a Menshevik editorial board of Central Body.

A veteran of the Irish independence struggle, he subsequently played hurling and football with Cork in the 1920s. Early life Jim Hurley was born in Clonakilty, County Cork on 26 February 1902. In his youth, he became involved in the Irish struggle for independence. He played a prominent role in the War of Independence as leader of a flying column in the Third Cork Brigade. Following the publication of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Hurley took the republican side in the subsequent Civil War. He was later interred in Cork and the Curragh but was released in 1924. Following this, Hurley returned to his native Clonakilty where he became town clerk and shortly afterwards, he enrolled as a night student at University College Cork. It was here that his sporting career began in earnest as he won a Fitzgibbon Cup medal with UCC's hurlers. Playing career =Club= In 1925, Hurley moved to Cork. He subsequently played his club hurling with Blackrock and his club football with UCC. With the famous Blackrock club, he won Cork SHC titles in 1925, 1927, 1929 and 1930. Hurley was also successful in terms of club football winning Cork SFC titles with UCC in 1927 and 1928. In 1930, he returned to Clonakilty with whom he won a Cork JFC title in 1930 and a Cork IFC title in 1931. For the next two years, he played senior football for Na Deasúnaigh but had little success with the side. In the mid-1930s, Hurley lived in County Meath where he played club hurling with Kilmessan and won a Meath SHC title. =Inter- county= By 1924, Hurley was playing junior hurling with Cork at inter-county level. This culminated in the winning of Munster and All-Ireland titles in 1925. He quickly joined the senior team and in 1926 captured his first National Hurling League, Munster and All-Ireland honours. Hurley was instrumental in attack in the final against Kilkenny. It was the beginning of a glorious era for Cork hurling. Hurley captured his second Munster medal in 1927, however, Dublin accounted for Cork in the All-Ireland final. He added a third Munster title to his collection of medals in 1928, before winning his second All-Ireland medal following a win over Galway. In 1929, he captured his fourth Munster medal in-a-row before later playing in his fourth All-Ireland final in-a-row. Cork's opponents in the final were Galway once again and Ahern scored a goal after just 30 seconds. It brought him his third All-Ireland medal. Cork had no little success in the championship of 1930, however, Hurley claimed his second National League medal. In 1931, Cork were back under the captaincy of Eudie Coughlan. Hurley won his fifth Munster title and once again qualified for the All-Ireland final, this time against Kilkenny. It took two replays to separate the two sides with Cork eventually emerging as the victors. He retired from inter-county hurling shortly after. Later life Following his retirement from inter-county hurling and football, Hurley had a distinguished career as a public servant. In 1932, he graduated from UCC with a BComm degree and was appointed County Accountant with Meath County Council. He later moved to Longford where he worked as County Secretary. In 1937, Hurley returned to Cork and studied for an Arts degree in UCC. He graduated in 1942 and returned to Meath as County Manager. In 1944, Hurley returned to Cork and was appointed Secretary and Bursar of UCC, a position he held until his death. His return to his native county coincided with a great era for Clonakilty's and for Cork's footballers. Hurley was a selector on the Cork football team that won the All-Ireland in 1945 and he was largely responsible for Jack Lynch’s selection on that team. He was also involved as a selector when Cork reached the All-Ireland finals of 1956 and 1957, and he was a selector on the Cork hurling team in the early 1960s. On 10 February 1965, Hurley died from stomach cancer aged 62. Teams References * Cronin, Jim, Making Connections – A Cork G.A.A Miscellany, (2005).

She was a leading figure in the Institute of the Sisters of Mercy, both in Ireland and in its expansion into the Australian colonies. Early life She was born Ellen Whitty at Pouldarrig, near Oylegate, a village seven miles from the town of Wexford in Ireland. She was the fourth of the six children of William and Johanna Whitty. Of her two sisters one also became a Sister of Mercy, known as Sister Mary Agnes; the other married the brother of a famous convert and publicist, Frederick Lucas. Father Robert Whitty, S.J., leader of the Jesuits in Great Britain, was her brother. Religious life in Ireland Whitty joined Catherine McAuley, the founder of the Sisters of Mercy, at the convent in Baggot Street, Dublin, in 1839. Serving as Whitty's spiritual guide through her novitiate, Catherine McAuley was extremely close to her and requested Mother Vincent to sit by her side in her dying hours. She was made Mistress of novices in 1844, and in 1849 Superior General of the religious congregation, third in succession to Mother McAuley. While she was served in that office, the Crimean War was being waged and she offered the services of the congregation to nurse the sick and wounded soldiers. Her own sister, Mary Agnes, was one of those who went to the seat of war. Involved in the planning of the Mater Hospital in Dublin, Whitty was especially skilled in organisation and as such was considered invaluable to the Sisters of Mercy community in Ireland. Additionally, she founded five new convents and established three institutions in Dublin for the care of underprivileged women and children. Religious life in Queensland It was this that held Whitty in Ireland until Bishop James Quinn, who had recently been named as the first Bishop of Brisbane for Queensland, encouraged her to come to his pioneer diocese. The new diocese, as large as France, Spain and Italy together, had then only two priests and four churches. She was appointed as the Superior of the group. Whitty arrived in Brisbane with five other Sisters on 10 May 1861 and that following November founded All Hallows' School, a Catholic girls school. Although the bishop removed her as Superior in 1863, the community of Sisters she founded soon spread throughout the new colony, with more than 20 convents founded before her death Bishop Quinn's decision to include Whitty in his pastoral plan proved to be inspirational, and under her leadership the Sisters of Mercy were able to make a positive contribution to the growth of the Catholic community throughout Queensland. Later life When Whitty died at All Hallows' Convent in 1892 she left behind \\"a group of 222 Sisters in 26 schools of 7000 students and welfare institutions protecting some 200 children\\" (Mercy Women, 2001, p. ix). Her funeral service was held in Cathedral of St Stephen, Brisbane and she was buried in the Nudgee Catholic Cemetery. Legacy In addition to the various educational institutions founded under her leadership, the Sisters of Mercy of Brisbane form an independent congregation within the tradition of Catherine McAuley.

Allsopp succeeded his father in 1838 in running of the family brewing business. He was very upset when shareholders claimed they had been misled over its 1887 stockmarket flotation, and he died within weeks of the criticism.Wardle, Terry Heroes & Villains of Worcestershire 2010 The History Press, Stroud, Gloucestershire. p12 Family Lord Hindlip married Elizabeth Tongue, daughter of William Tongue, in 1839.

A noted autobiographer, Joffo was perhaps best known for his memoir Un sac de billes (A Bag of Marbles), which has been translated into eighteen languages. Early life Joffo was born in Paris in the 18th arrondissement. He left school at 14 with a certificat d'études (a former school leaving certificate, taken at the end of primary education) in his pocket and joined his brothers in the family's barber shop. Career =A Bag of Marbles= His memoir Un sac de billes (A Bag of Marbles), written as a novel, tells the story of Joffo as a young Jewish boy during the Holocaust. When Joffo was ten, his father gave him and his brother five thousand francs each and instructions to flee Nazi- occupied Paris by foot, train and bus, and join their brothers Henri and Albert in Menton on the Mediterranean coast, where they would be safe in Vichy France, unoccupied by the Nazis. The book \\"A Bag of Marbles\\" tells of this journey. Joffo in 2012 Joffo and his twelve-year-old brother Maurice travel south across France by themselves. They are attempting to escape from the grasp of Hitler's SS men as the Nazis infiltrate France. They travel through northern France to the demilitiarised zone in the south. The boys then spend four blissfully safe months in Menton on the border of France and Italy with their older brothers Henri and Albert, before having to leave the town for Nice where their parents are waiting. Joffo returns to the city of Paris shortly after its liberation is announced in a crowded train, as does Maurice, although in his typical style he also takes enough cheese to make a large profit. They are reunited with their family in the barbershop - although sadly not their father, who perished in a concentration camp before the end of the war. =Other works= Joffo also wrote Anna et son orchestre (Anna and Her Orchestra), which tells the story of Joseph's mother from the time she was 11 years old to the time she met Joseph Joffo's father in Paris. His novel Baby- foot, published in 1977, follows on from Un sac de billes and describes his life in Paris following World War II and his discovery of American values. La Vieille dame de Djerba, published in 1984, was written after Joffo met a woman called Liza at a synagogue in Djerba, an island off the coast of Tunisia. He was amazed to discover, after assuming she was a beggar and offering her money, that she knew the names of his mother and grandmother. Death Joffo died on 6 December 2018 at a hospital in Saint-Laurent-du-Var, Alpes-Maritimes from a short-illness at the age of 87. Other media On 10 December 1975, Un sac de billes premiered in France as a motion picture. The film was also released internationally under the title A Bag of Marbles. A second film of Un Sac de Billes was released in 2017. During filming in Nice, the hanging of a Nazi flag on the Palais des Rois Sardes caused a frenzy between the local population and the crew.

Etymology The name comes from a quotation from Jules Verne's novel Journey to the Center of the Earth. The hero, Professor Lidenbrock, finds a secret inscription in Latin that reads: Descende, audax viator, et terrestre centrum attinges (Descend, bold traveller, and you will attain the center of the Earth). Biology It is the only bacterium found in water samples obtained underground in the Mponeng gold mine in South Africa. Approximately four micrometres in length, it has survived for millions of years on chemical food sources that derive from the radioactive decay of minerals in the surrounding rock. This makes it one of the few known organisms that does not depend on sunlight for nourishment, and the only species known to be alone in its ecosystem. Ca. D. audaxviator has genes for extracting carbon from dissolved carbon dioxide and for nitrogen fixation. It may also have acquired genes from a species of archaea by horizontal gene transfer. They have been isolated from Earth's surface for several million years because analyses of the water that they live in showed that it is very old and has not been diluted by surface water. As the environment at that depth is so much like the early Earth, it gives a clue as to what type of creatures might have existed before there was an oxygen atmosphere. Billions of years ago, some of the first bacteria on the planet may have thrived in similar conditions. The newly discovered microbes could shed light into the origins of life on Earth. \\"Ca. D. audaxviator\\" is a Gram positive sulfate-reducing bacterium (making it the first complete such genome). The genome contains an unusual transposon and possesses many sites of insertion. Its complete intolerance of oxygen suggests long-term isolation. The hydrocarbons in that environment do not come from living organisms. The source of the hydrogen needed for their respiration comes from the decomposition of water by radioactive decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium. The radiation allows for the production of sulphur compounds that these bacteria can use as a high-energy source of food. \\"Ca. D. audaxviator\\" not only survives in a complete absence of organic compounds, light, and oxygen, but also in temperatures as high as and a pH of 9.3. The physiology that enables it to live in these extreme conditions is a tribute to its unusually large genome, consisting of 2157 genes instead of the 1500 of its peers. If conditions become unfavorable for normal life, \\"Ca. D. audaxviator\\" is able to encyst, safeguarding its DNA from heat, extreme pH, and the lack of water.

Whilst the main Leeds railway station was being rebuilt by Railtrack (now Network Rail) during 1999 and 2002, there was a need for the station itself to be closed during nights and at Christmas of 2000. A temporary station was built on the Down Whitehall Line just off Springwell Road near the junction of Water Lane, in Holbeck, with a bus turning circle and bus stands outside the station. Bus services ran to ferry passengers from the industrial estate in which the station was placed to Leeds City station. A passenger welcome board stood at the junction of Water Lane and Springwell Road, informing passengers of this temporary station, the building work at Leeds City railway station and other information. The colour scheme of the time was the standard white, grey and crimson colours of Railtrack. CCTV signs were placed around the site, warning that footage of people could be used in a court of law. The station consisted of a single platform that was mainly used by Transpennine Express trains between 12am and 5am; as well as some local Northern Rail services during daytime off-peak hours. The station also contained two Portakabin buildings; one was a waiting room and the other included toilets and office accommodation.

Like other jacana species, it is adapted to the floating vegetation of tropical freshwater wetlands. Description A comb-crested jacana at Corroboree Billabong, Northern Territory, Australia This species is unmistakable. It has a black crown and hindneck with a fleshy red wattle covering the forehead and forecrown, contrasting with a white face and throat. The comb is pinker in breeding adults, more orange when not breeding. There is a broad black band on the lower breast with white belly. The underwing and flight feathers, which show most prominently in flight, are black. Back and upperwing mainly grey- brown with black primary coverts, rump and tail. The long legs with extremely long toes trail in flight. The male is slightly smaller than the female and measures in length and weighs . The female measures in length and weighs .CRC Handbook of Avian Body Masses by John B. Dunning Jr. (Editor). CRC Press (1992), . The wingspan ranges from . Fogg Dam, Middle Point, Northern Territory, Australia, March 2014 Distribution and habitat The bird occurs in south-eastern Borneo, the southern Philippines, Sulawesi, Moluccas, Lesser Sunda Islands, north and south-east New Guinea, New Britain (Lake Lalili), and northern and eastern Australia. Its habitat are large freshwater wetlands, swamps and lakes with abundant floating vegetation, such as water-lilies or water hyacinth, forming a mat on the water surface which it is able to walk on. Although the species is rare and localised it is not globally threatened. Behaviour = General Behaviour = The comb-crested jacana walks slowly and deliberately. It often congregates in flocks. When disturbed, it flies low over water and lands again on open vegetation. =Breeding= The comb-crested jacana is polyandrous. It builds a flimsy nest on floating or emergent vegetation, in which the female lays four lustrous, pale brown eggs covered by black markings. Only males incubate. The young hatch well-developed and soon leave the nest. =Feeding= It eats seeds and aquatic insects gleaned from floating vegetation on the water surface. =Voice= This species gives a squeaky, high-pitched chittering, also described as a shrill trill with an explosive soft bugle.

The complex was destroyed by a fire in 1783 shortly after its completion and was immediately rebuilt. A fire in 1911 destroyed the madrasah, and subsequent road construction work destroyed many other auxiliary structures to the mosque.

CPCC Gueishan oil refinery CPC No.10 fuel barge in Keelung Harbor CPC No.9 fuel barge in Keelung Harbor CPC Corporation () is a state-owned petroleum, natural gas, and gasoline company in Taiwan and is the core of the Taiwanese petrochemicals industry. History =Early history= CPC was founded on 1 June 1946 in Shanghai as Chinese Petroleum Corporation (中國石油) by the government of the Republic of China (ROC, then on Mainland China). With the Kuomintang's retreat to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War, CPC was transferred from the Council of Resources to the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The company merged all relevant facilities and companies (Japanese 6th Naval Fuel Depot, Teikoku Oil, Nippon Oil, etc.) in Taiwan. Its main businesses include surveying, extracting, refining, transporting, and selling petroleum. It also produces various chemicals and has retail outlets all over Taiwan. CPC's fixing of petrol prices helped Taiwan through the 1970s Energy Crisis. =Democratization and modern history= Taiwan's petroleum industry was a CPC monopoly prior to June 1996. However, deregulation allowed the establishment of privately owned and operated petroleum refinery enterprises, leading to Formosa Plastics Group's launch of Formosa Petrochemical Corporation (台塑石化). In February 2007, the company's board approved name change to \\"CPC Corporation Taiwan\\" and the Chinese name from 中國石油 to 台灣中油. This was to avoid confusion with PetroChina, the China state-run corporation which also has the Chinese name 中國石油, and was part of government efforts to desinicize Taiwanese entities which have \\"China\\" their names. However, the Kuomintang political party argued that the name change is not valid because no legislation was passed in the legislature to support it. KMT believes that the approval of the Legislative Yuan is required before a state-owned company can change its name. In December 2018, production started at the Prelude floating liquefied natural gas facility in Australia, which is the world’s largest floating production structure. The company holds shares alongside investors Shell, Inpex Corporation, and Korea Gas Corporation. In 2019 a Norwegian tanker named Front Altair carrying a cargo of naphtha for CPC Corporation was attacked in the Gulf of Oman. The entire NT$1.07b (US$34m) cargo was lost but the crew escaped unharmed and the cargo was insured. After insurance CPC Corporation incurred direct costs of NT$8m (US$254,000) associated with the incident. The cargo represented two days of Taiwanese consumption but had minimal impacts as the company had 45 day supply in reserve. In 2020 the first shipment of carbon-neutral liquified-natural gas arrived at CPC’s Yung-An LNG Terminal in Kaohsiung. The shipment was the first in a new program designed to render fuel imports carbon-neutral by buying carbon credits on the global market. The initial purchase from Shell Eastern Trading was for credits certified by the UN’s REDD+ program which supports forests in developing countries.  Facilities  In 2019 CPC announced the construction of a third LNG terminal, a facility in Taoyuan expected to be completed by 2023 with an initial capacity of 1 million tonnes per year (tpy). In 2019 CPC received approval from the Environmental Protection Administration to construct a LNG terminal in Taichung.  Suppliers  CPC Corporation was a historic buyer of Iranian oil and received a sanctions waiver from the United States when they imposed sanctions on Iranian oil imports. Despite receiving a sanctions waver CPC Corporation chose to end its use of Iran as a source country. In 2018 CPC signed an agreement with American Cheniere Energy to purchase liquefied natural gas for 25 years. Deliveries are set to begin in 2021.

History  Formed in September 1944 by André Malraux,Michalon, Roget (ed.): Les Grandes Unités françaises, 6. Paris: Imprimerie nationale, 1980, p. 568. the brigade comprised approximately 1,000 menMichalon, p. 569. Strength valid as of 27 November 1944. organized into three battalions named for the cities of Metz, Mulhouse, and Strasbourg. Malraux's achievement in organizing this brigade was noteworthy in that few brigade-sized units of FFI men were organized at all, and his brigade was one of the longest to retain an organization independent from that of the French regular army. Although the men of the brigade were very motivated, many were not military veterans and the unit was equipped with a mixture of Allied and German weapons and material. Despite these disadvantages, the brigade compiled a good combat record. Not assigned permanently to a division, the brigade was part of the army reserve of General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny's French First Army, and as such, was assigned as a reinforcement unit to various regular French divisions. From 26 September to 16 October 1944, the brigade fought in the vicinity of Thillot.Michalon, p. 569. During November 26–27, 1944, the brigade fought with the French 5th Armored Division to liberate the town of Dannemarie in the Vosges Mountains. Subsequently, Malraux personally led the brigade's assault on the town of Ballersdorf. In January 1945, the brigade took part in the defense of Strasbourg during the German Nordwind offensive. During this action, 140 men of the brigade were encircled for three days from January 8–10 in Gerstheim, south of Strasbourg. On the afternoon of January 10, the Gerstheim garrison was assaulted by 10 Tiger tanks and two companies of infantry, forcing the garrison to withdraw during the night after losing 40 men.Rollot, Bernard (ed.): Les Grandes Unités françaises, 4. Paris: Imprimerie nationale, 1975, p. 105. On February 27, 1945, the troops of the brigade were directed to enter regular service as part of the French 14th Infantry Division. On March 22, the brigade departed the lines of the French 9th Colonial Division to form the 3rd Demi-Brigade of Chasseurs, ending the independent history of the Brigade Alsace-Lorraine.

He was born at Nancy, studied at the École Militaire, entered the army in 1803, and distinguished himself at the battles of Austerlitz, Essling, Wagram, and the Beresina. In 1814, he was promoted colonel. When Napoleon returned from Elba, Jacqueminot was made commander of lancers. He made a brilliant charge at Quatre Bras and after Waterloo refused transfer to the service of the Bourbons and was imprisoned for a month. After his release, Jacqueminot established at Bar-le-Duc a great silk factory, which gave employment to many of the veterans of the French Imperial Army. Elected to the House of Deputies in 1827, he joined in the protest of the Two Hundred and Twenty-one against Polignac, and with Pajol directed the Rambouillet expedition which led Charles X to leave France. In 1842, he succeeded Chaud as commander of the National Guards of the Seine. Louis Philippe made him Viscount in 1846. His indecision at the head of the Guards made possible the revolution of 1848 and he was retired the same year. 'Général Jacqueminot' (Roussel/Rousselet 1853) He died at the age of 78 in 1865. In 1853, Rousselet named a red rose cultivar 'Général Jacqueminot' in his honour. This flower is used as the official flower of the Alpha Omicron Pi sorority across the United States. In a 1967 essay, “The Young Founders of Alpha Omicron Pi,” PIP Mary D. Drummond wrote, “[I was asked] whether the Founders were influenced by a poem, a novel. Stella says that the rose was chosen because of its age, beauty, and color. It typifies the Unfolding Spirit of AOII.

The station joined the network in November 1982, following the opening of the line between Tynemouth and St. James. The station is situated on the site of the former Walker station, which opened in 1839, under the Newcastle and North Shields Railway. This later became part of the North Tyneside Loop, served by the North Eastern Railway. The station was later renamed Walker Gate in April 1889. In the days of British Rail, the station was known as both Walkergate and Walker Gate. The Tyne and Wear Metro, however, uses the single word form. Following closure for conversion in the early 1980s, the station was demolished and re-built. The original North Eastern Railway footbridge was preserved, and is now located at Pickering station, on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway. The station underwent modernisation work between September 2013 and July 2014, as part of the Metro: All Change programme. This involved improvements to accessibility (including the installation of a passenger lift), aesthetic changes, and the introduction of new smart ticket machines and validators. The station was used by 213,773 passengers in 2017–18.  Facilities  Step-free access is available at all stations across the Tyne and Wear Metro network, with ramps providing step- free access to both platforms, as well as a lift providing step-free access to platform 1 (for trains towards Whitley Bay). The station is equipped with ticket machines, sheltered waiting area, seating, next train information displays, timetable posters, and an emergency help point on both platforms. Ticket machines are able to accept payment with credit and debit card (including contactless payment), notes and coins. The station is also fitted with smartcard validators, which feature at all stations across the network. There is a small free car park available at the station, with 24 spaces. There is also the provision for cycle parking, with 3 cycle pods available for use.  Service and frequency  Walkergate is served by the Yellow Line, which operates between South Shields and St. James with an end-to-end journey time of 83 minutes. Services from platform 1 operate towards South Shields via Whitley Bay, with the first train departing at 05:57 (06:09 on Saturday and 06:16 on Sunday). Services from platform 2 operate towards St. James, with the first train departing at 05:43 (06:01 on Saturday and 06:46 on Sunday).

The film, created by the NRW Film Fund (Filmstiftung NRW), was the second most popular film in German cinemas in 2004, reaching an audience of almost 7 million. It also counts as the 4th most successful German film ever in Germany since the audience payment cap.  Plot  Little Red Riding Hood is picking flowers when she decides to enter Unterwaldt, a dark forest. The dwarf Bubi spies on her, but is attacked by a bear, who turns out to be the disguised dwarf Tschakko. As looking at a woman is forbidden by the dwarves, he is punished by having squirrels tickle his feet. The dwarves have a meeting which is interrupted by \\"giant\\" Ralphie. He wants to become a member of \\"the seven dwarves\\", but this is impossible as \\"there are already seven dwarves\\". The dwarves sent Ralphie away and decide to blow up the bridge so women won't be able to enter the forest in the future. As they have had a bad experience with dynamite, they only place a sign which forbids women to pass. Meanwhile, the ghost in the queen's magic mirror tells the queen that while she is beautiful, someone named Snow White is even more so. The queen calls the hunter, who had previously been ordered to get rid of Snow White. It turns out the hunter took her to the orphanage. At the orphanage, a naive Snow White still plays with her dolls. The ghost of the mirror appears in the mirror of her dollhouse and informs Snow White that a round-up has been organized to find her. Snow White runs away, and is tracked by the hunter and his dog Brutus, but after losing Snow White's track, they return to the castle. The hunter tells the queen his dog Brutus mauled Snow White into a thousand pieces and ate her. When the dwarves return at their cottage, they find a sleeping Snow White. They want to get rid of her, but their opinion changes after Snow White suggests they split up the house into two parts. Snow White considered dwarves to be much smaller. They declare the length of a dwarf is an old prejudice. It is not the length, but the lifestyle which determines whether someone is a dwarf or not. Upon this, Ralphie once again asks if he can be a dwarf, but this is again rejected as \\"there are already seven dwarves\\". Snow White discovers why the various dwarves have an aversion to women: Sunny and Cloudy were expelled from a school play by their female teacher. Speedy fell in love with Rapunzel, but while he was climbing her left braid, Rapunzel cut it off and Speedy fell. Tschakko's aversion is caused as he can't and won't beat up women. Cookie once made vegetarian food which was not appreciated by his mother. Brumboss starts his story, but does not get further than the first sentence. The queen consults her magic mirror and finds out Snow White is still alive; she locks up the hunter in the dungeon. She dresses up and goes to Snow White. While the dwarves are planning a surprise party for Snow White's 18th birthday, the queen kidnaps her. The dwarves look for her, but only find the queen's crown. They take their horse and head to the castle. Once there, they notice Brummboss is missing. Snow White is in the dungeon and gets a visit from Brummboss, disguised as a priest. He finally tells her why he hates women. According to the midwife, his wife and child died during delivery. Brummboss, who was king, abdicated and threw away his crown. The midwife took the crown and became the new queen, as the law states that the ruler is the person who wears the crown. Brummboss, still disguised, takes Snow White to the scaffold. Just before her execution, Brummboss reveals that he is the king who disappeared 18 years ago, and also reveals he is Snow White's father. He puts the crown on his head and becomes king again. The remaining dwarves return to their cottage. As they are now six, Ralphie is selected as the seventh dwarf. The dwarves decide not to help women ever again, but this promise does not stand long: Little Red Riding Hood knocks at the door and searches for help as she is lost in the wood.

His career included All- Ireland Championship victories as a player and later as a selector with the Cork senior hurling team. After beginning his career at club level with Ballincollig, Murphy joined the Cork minor team in 1930 and began an inter- county career that spanned 20 years. After Munster Championship success with the junior side, he was promoted to the Cork senior team in 1939. From his debut, Murphy was ever-present as a corner-back and made a total of 37 championship appearances in a career that ended with his last game in 1949. During that time he was part of five All-Ireland Championship-winning teams, including Cork's record-breaking four titles in-a-row between 1941 and 1944. Murphy also secured six Munster Championship medals and three National Hurling League medals. Playing career =Ballincollig= Murphy first played for the Ballincollig club at juvenile and underage levels in the late 1920s before joining the club's top adult team. He claimed his first major silverware in 1934 when Ballincollig defeated Kinsale by 3-03 to 2-03 to win the Cork Intermediate Championship. Ballincollig qualified for a second successive intermediate final the following year, with Murphy once again lining out at right corner-back. He ended the game with a second successive winners' medal following the 4-02 to 3-02 victory over St. Columba's. After three unsuccessful years in the Cork Senior Championship, Ballincollig regarded and qualified for the 1939 intermediate final. Murphy claimed a third winners' medal after captaining the team to a 4-06 to 4-02 victory over Ballinora. In accepting the cup, he was described by County Board registrar Liam O'Shea as being \\"a worthy representative in the Cork senior hurling team.\\" Ballincollig's second stint in the senior championship saw Murphy line out in three successive final defeats by Glen Rovers and St. Finbarr's in 1941, 1942 and 1943. He captained the team on a number of occasions, while he also lined out with divisional side Muskerry. =Cork= Minor and junior Murphy first played for Cork as a member of the minor team when he was included as a panellist during the 1930 Munster Championship. He made his first appearance for the team on 24 September 1930 when he was included at left wing-back in Cork's 4-03 to 3-00 defeat by Tipperary in the Munster final. Murphy played with the minor team for a further two years, lining out in goal in the unsuccessful campaigns in 1931 and 1932. Murphy was in his final year of the minor grade when he was also drafted onto the Cork junior team He won a Munster Championship in his debut season after a 1-04 to 1-02 victory over Clare in the 1932 Munster final. After a one-year absence from the team, Murphy played his last game in the junior grade when Cork suffered a 7-10 to 5-02 defeat by Waterford in the 1934 Munster final. Senior Murphy's performances at club level brought him to the attention of the Cork senior selectors and he was drafted onto the team during the 1938-39 National League. He made his championship debut at left wing-back on 25 June 1939 in a 7-04 to 4-03 defeat of Waterford before later claiming his first Munster Championship medal after a 4-03 to 3-04 victory over Limerick in the final. On 3 September 1939, Murphy lined out at left corner-back when Cork suffered a 2-07 to 3-03 defeat by Kilkenny in the \\"thunder and Lightning\\" All-Ireland final. Murphy claimed his first national silverware when Cork defeated Tipperary by 8-09 to 6-04 to win the 1939-40 National League title. He was selected at right corner-back when Cork surrendered their provincial title to Limerick in the 1940 Munster final. After winning a second successive National League medal after a 4-11 to 2-07 victory over Dublin in the 1941 league final, Murphy lined out in the second All-Ireland final of his career on 28 September 1941 when he was selected at full-back against Dublin. He ended the game with his first All-Ireland medal after the 5-11 to 0-06 victory. Murphy ended the season by lining out in Cork's 5-04 to 2-05 defeat by Tipperary in the delayed Munster final. Murphy lined out in a fourth successive Munster final the following year, with Cork claiming the title after a 4-15 to 4-01 defeat of Tipperary. He was again selected at right corner-back for the subsequent All- Ireland final against Dublin and collected his second successive All-Ireland winners' medal after a 2-14 to 3-04 victory. After winning a third provincial championship medal following a 2-13 to 3-08 victory over Waterford in the 1943 Munster final, Murphy subsequently lined out in a third successive All-Ireland final. He claimed a third successive winners' medal after the 5-16 to 0-04 victory over Antrim. Murphy claimed a third successive Munster Championship winners' medal - the fourth of his career - after a 4-06 to 3-06 victory over Limerick in the 1944 Munster final replay. On 3 September 1944, he again lined out at right corner-back in a fourth successive All-Ireland final appearance and ended the 2-13 to 1-02 victory over Dublin by becoming one of a select group of players to have won four successive All-Ireland medals. After failing to secure a fifth successive title in 1945, Murphy won a fifth provincial championship winners' medal after the 3-08 to 1-03 defeat of Limerick in the 1946 Munster final. For the five time in six seasons, he lined out in the subsequent All-Ireland final with Kilkenny providing the opposition. Murphy claimed a fifth All-Ireland winners' medal after again playing at right corner-back in the 7-05 to 3-08 victory. Murphy claimed a sixth provincial winners' medal after the 2-06 to 2-03 defeat of Limerick in the final. He was again at right corner-back for his seventh All-Ireland final appearance on 7 September 1947, but ended the game on the losing side after the 0-14 to 2-07 defeat by Kilkenny in what is regarded as one of the greatest games of all time. Murphy won a third National League medal after a 3-03 to 1-02 defeat of Tipperary in the 1948 league final. Later that season he played in the eighth Munster final but ended on the losing side after a 4-07 to 3-09 defeat by Waterford. A defeat by Tipperary in the 1949 Munster Championship brought the curtain down on Murphy's inter-county career. =Munster= Murphy was first selected for the Munster team in advance of the 1940 Railway Cup. It was the first of nine successive seasons with the inter-provincial team and he ended his debut year with his first winners' medal after a 4-09 to 5-04 defeat of Leinster in the final. After surrendering the title to Leinster the following year, Murphy claimed five successive titles between 1942 and 1946 as he came to be known as one of the mainstays of the team. He claimed his seventh and final Railway Cup medal as captain of the team in his final game in the 1948 Railway Cup final. Coaching career Murphy was added to the selection committee of the Cork senior hurling team in the mid 1960s. His tenure with the team coincided with a return to success after a long period without a title, with Cork claiming the 1966 Munster Championship after a 4-09 to 2-09 victory over Waterford. Murphy later helped to guide the team to a first All- Ireland Championship in 12 years after a five-point defeat of Kilkenny in the final. Personal life and death Murphy, who spent much of his working life with Dunlop's, was married to Catherine Murray and lived in the Bishopstown suburb of Cork. They had a son, Eddie, and two daughters, Mary and Audrey. Eddie also enjoyed a lengthy career as a hurler and won an All-Ireland B Championship medal with the Kerry senior hurling team in 1986. On 24 August 1977, Murphy died suddenly after being taken ill at his home.

'Chashtana (Greek: CIACTANCA, Brahmi: 12px12px12px Cha-shta-na, Kharosthi: 𐨖𐨟𐨣, IAST: ', or Chastana) was a ruler of the Saka Western Satraps in northwestern India during 78-130 CE. He was satrap of Ujjain during that period. Among the modern scholars, the beginning of the Saka era is widely equated to the ascension of Chashtana (possibly to Mahakshatrapa) in 78 CE. A statue found in Mathura together with statues of the Kushan king Kanishka and Vima Taktu, and bearing the name \\"Shastana\\" (Middle Brahmi script of the Kushan period: 10px13px10px Sha-sta-na) is often attributed to Chashtana himself.\\"The three letters give us a complete name, which I read as Ṣastana (vide facsimile and cast).

Chashtana was mentioned by Ptolemy as \\"Tiasthenes\\" or \\"Testenes\\", ruling a large area of Western India into the 2nd century CE, especially the area of Ujjain (\\"Ozene\\"), during the reign of the Satavahana king Vasisthiputra Sri Pulamavi. According to Ptolemy, Chashtana directly ruled Ujjain, while Paithan (Pratisthana) continued to be ruled by Siristolemaios (identified with Sri Pulumayi, son of Gautamiputra Satakarni).Alain Danielou, A Brief History of India (Inner Traditions, 2003), mentioned here Ptolemy in his \\"Geographia\\", where he qualifies the Western Satraps as \\"Indo-Scythians\\", describes Chashtana's territory as starting from Patalene in the West, to his capital Ujjain in the east (\\"Ozena-Regia Tiastani\\", \\"Ozene, capital of king Chashtana\\"), and beyond Barigaza in the south: Chashtana was the grandfather of the great Western Satrap conqueror Rudradaman I. Chashtana was founder of one of the two major Saka Satrap dynasties in north-western India, the Bhadramukhas; the other, short-lived dynasty, the Kshaharatas (\\"Satraps\\"), included Bhumaka and Nahapana. Coinage The coinage of Chastana combines a corrupted Greek legend on the obverse, around his portrait, and a Brahmi script legend on the reverse around a \\"Three hills and river\\" symbol together with the sun and two moons.

Background He was born in Manchester, the son of J. R. Oliver. He was educated at Bowdon College, Manchester Grammar School and Corpus Christi College, Oxford where he received a Bachelor of Arts. He qualified as a Barrister-at-law.‘OLIVER, Philip Milner’, Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920–2007; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2007 accessed 27 Jan 2014 Career In 1909 he was called to the Bar by Lincoln's Inn and practised on the Northern Circuit.\\"Mr. P. M. Oliver.\\" Times [London, England] 13 Apr. 1954: 10. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 27 Jan. 2014. In 1914, at the age of 30, he was selected as Liberal party prospective parliamentary candidate for the Knutsford division of Cheshire. This was a Unionist seat that the Liberal had only ever won once, in 1906. The outbreak of war postponed the general election. During the war he served as Honorary County Secretary of the East Lancashire Branch of the British Red Cross Society. He was Liberal candidate for the newly created constituency of Manchester Blackley at the 1918 General Election. He expressed support for David Lloyd George and his Coalition Government, as did his Unionist opponent. As a result, the Coalition Government partners agreed not to jointly endorse either candidate. He came third, behind the Labour candidate; In a special Honours list of 1920 he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his wartime work with the British Red Cross Society, in 1918 he had been made an Officer of the Order (OBE). Oliver served as Honorary Secretary of the Manchester Liberal Federation.\\"Liberal Gains in the Citadel of Free Trade: New Manchester M. P. S.\\" Illustrated London News [London, England] 15 Dec. 1923: 1102. Illustrated London News. Web. 27 Jan. 2014. Oliver, along with the overwhelming majority of Manchester Liberals decided to oppose the Coalition Government that had become more dominated by Unionists. He was retained as Liberal candidate for the 1922 General Election, at which he overtook the Labour candidate to finish second; In 1923 he had published Whatsoever Things, Fugitive Essays on the Foundations of Democracy. When Stanley Baldwin became Unionist Prime Minister in 1923, he decided to call an election to be fought on the issue of his desire to introduce taxes on imports. Manchester was an area which was known to oppose such measures in its support for Free Trade. Both of Manchester's free trade parties, Liberal and Labour, sought electoral co-operation. As a result, no Labour candidate stood at Blackley, helping Oliver to gain the seat; By 1924, with a Labour government in office the political climate had changed and Labour fielded a candidate against Oliver at the general election. This helped ensure the Unionist regained the seat; By the time of the 1929 General Election, Oliver and the Manchester Liberals were at the forefront of the party's radical platform, and despite the presence of a Labour candidate, he was able to re- gain his Blackley seat from the Unionist; In 1931, following the financial crisis that resulted in the Labour government being replaced by an all-party National Government, Oliver supported the leadership of Sir Herbert Samuel, who had led the Liberal party into the National Government. At the following general election, the Conservatives in Manchester chose to split the National Government vote by standing against sitting Liberal MPs. One of the main issues of the election was Free trade v Import tariffs, as had been the case in 1923. However, unlike then, the Labour party in Manchester chose to split the free trade vote and Oliver thus found himself in a three-way contest and lost his seat; In 1933 he was parachuted in to be the Liberal candidate at the 1933 Altrincham by-election. This was a Conservative seat that the Liberals had last won in 1923. At the 1931 General Election the Altrincham Liberals had decided not to split the National Government vote and the Conservative was returned unopposed. Nationally, the Liberals had resigned their offices in the National Government but continued to sit on the government benches. At a difficult time for the party, Oliver was able to retain the party position and share of the vote when compared to the 1929 election figures; In 1933 he had published Genesis to Geneva, an essay. By 1935, the Liberal party had moved into opposition to the National Government and Oliver fought the election in direct opposition to his Conservative opponent. However, the Labour party again chose to stand, splitting the anti-government vote and allowing the Conservative to win again; In 1936 he was elected to serve on the Liberal Party Council.The Liberal Magazine, 1936 In 1939 Oliver had been re-selected as Liberal prospective parliamentary candidate for Blackley.The Liberal Magazine, 1939 A general election was expected to take place sometime in 1939 and there was some support in the Labour party, not to oppose Liberal candidates who were better placed to defeat Conservative candidates. This feeling was in line with Sir Stafford Cripps advocating a Popular Front to defeat the National Government. In 1939, the Blackley Labour party had no candidate in place.Report of the Annual Conference, 1939 Thus Oliver would have been particularly confident of making a return to parliament. However, the outbreak of war postponed the elections until 1945. In 1944 he had published Back to Balfour on the subject of a Jewish state as promised in the Balfour Declaration. In 1945 Oliver, now 60 years old, was again the Liberal candidate for Blackley, but the political climate had changed and Labour swept to victory both locally and nationally; Oliver did not stand for parliament again. He died in 1954 aged 69.

It can be reached from the French resort of Avoriaz and from the Swiss towns of Les Crosets and Champéry. Effectively, one starts the run standing on the Swiss-French border, plunging down the Swiss side of the mountain towards Les Crosets.  Statistics  The slope is classified in the Swiss/French difficulty rating as orange, which means that it is rated as too difficult to fit in the standard classification of green (very easy), blue (easy), red (intermediate) and black (difficult). It has a length of 1 kilometre and a vertical drop of 331 metres, starting at 2,151 metres above sea level.  Slope layout  thumbThe slope has moguls throughout. It starts in a narrow pass on the mountain top with an inclication of 40 degrees. In winters with heavy snowfall, the moguls at the top can grow to enormous dimensions — the size of a small car — because of the heavy turns people take to compensate for the inclination and narrow slope. After the initial 50 metres, the slope widens to the left, allowing skiers and boarders to traverse to a less steep area and make their descent by curving around the more steep and dangerous path directly down the slope. The direct path goes into a pass between two rocky areas on the right hand side of the slope, about halfway down, which at its narrowest is about ten metres wide. This gives the skier or boarder an impression of being in a very steep half pipe with moguls. After this passage, the slope eases out with fewer moguls, and narrows as the easier left-hand path merges with the direct path. The last two hundred metres are a flat run directly towards the chair lift back up the mountain, or the easier runs towards Les Crosets and Champéry.  How to ski/board it  The initial 50 metres have to be skied or boarded by everyone taking Le Pas de Chavanette. Especially without fresh snow, the slope gets icy quickly, turning the area between moguls into ice sheets. Not making a turn in these situations means that you miss the next mogul, and pick up too much speed to make the next one after that, starting off a tumble that ends a couple of hundred metres down the slope, while hitting a few dozen icy bumps in the course. After this initial stretch, the choice can be made, up until the rocky passage in the direct path, to escape to the less steep left hand side of the slope, where a stumble is less dangerous. The direct path down Le Pas de Chavanette, to the right hand side and down the rocky passage, should only be taken by very experienced skiers and riders who know how to handle moguls, as it is effectively a continuation of the first 50 metres. As the slope eases out, it is easier to negotiate the moguls and make a single run down to the end, although the inclination and bumps still call for significant dexterity and physical strength. Wearing protective gear like a helmet and a back protector is highly recommended.

A diagonal relationship is said to exist between certain pairs of diagonally adjacent elements in the second and third periods (first 20 elements) of the periodic table. These pairs (lithium (Li) and magnesium (Mg), beryllium (Be) and aluminium (Al), boron (B) and silicon (Si), etc.) exhibit similar properties; for example, boron and silicon are both semiconductors, forming halides that are hydrolysed in water and have acidic oxides. The organization of elements on the periodic table in to horizontal rows and vertical columns makes certain relationships more apparent (periodic law). Moving rightward and descending the periodic table have opposite effects on atomic radii of isolated atoms. Moving rightward across the period decreases the atomic radii of atoms, while moving down the group will increase the atomic radii. Similarly, on moving rightward a period, the elements become progressively more covalent, less basic and more electronegative, whereas on moving down a group the elements become more ionic, more basic and less electronegative. Thus, on both descending a period and crossing a group by one element, the changes \\"cancel\\" each other out, and elements with similar properties which have similar chemistry are often found – the atomic size, electronegativity, properties of compounds (and so forth) of the diagonal members are similar. It is found that the chemistry of a first-group (second period) element often has similarities to the chemistry of the second-group (third period) element one column to the right of it in the periodic table. Thus, the chemistry of Li has similarities to that of Mg, the chemistry of Be has similarities to that of Al, and the chemistry of B has similarities to that of Si. These are called diagonal relationships. (It is not as noticeable after B and Si.) The reasons for the existence of diagonal relationships are not fully understood, but charge density is a factor. For example, Li+ is a small cation with a +1 charge and Mg2+ is somewhat larger with a +2 charge, so the ionic potential of each of the two ions is roughly the same. It was revealed by an examination that the charge density of lithium is much closer to that of magnesium than to those of the other alkali metals. Using the Li–Mg pair (under room temperature and pressure): # When combined with oxygen under standard conditions, Li and Mg form only normal oxides whereas Na forms peroxide and metals below Na, in addition, form superoxides. # Li is the only Group 1 element which forms a stable nitride, Li3N. Mg, as well as other Group 2 elements, also form nitrides. # Lithium carbonate, phosphate and fluoride are sparingly soluble in water. The corresponding Group 2 salts are insoluble. (Think lattice and solvation energies). # Both Li and Mg form covalent organometallic compounds. LiMe and MgMe2 (cf. Grignard reagents) are both valuable synthetic reagents. The other Group 1 and Group 2 analogues are ionic and extremely reactive (and hence difficult to manipulate). # Chlorides of both Li and Mg are deliquescent (absorb moisture from surroundings) and soluble in alcohol and pyridine. Lithium chloride, like magnesium chloride (MgCl2·6H2O) separates out from hydrated crystal LiCl·2H2O. #Lithium carbonate and magnesium carbonate are both unstable and can produce corresponding oxides and carbon dioxide when they are heated. Further diagonal similarities have also been suggested for carbon-phosphorus and nitrogen-sulfur, along with extending the Li-Mg and Be- Al relationships down into the transition elements.

Her first novel, What Was Lost, was published in January 2007. This novel received critical acclaim as an examination of the often lacklustre and empty experience of modern life, contrasted with the energy and optimism of a young girl who went missing in the mid-1980s. What Was Lost was long listed for the 2007 Man Booker Prize for Fiction and the Orange Prize for Fiction, and shortlisted for the Guardian First Book Award. It won the Jelf Group First Novel Award at the Guildford Book Festival and the prestigious First Novel prize at the Costa Book Awards in January 2008. In April 2008 she was named Newcomer of the Year at the Galaxy British Book Awards. Her second book, The News Where You Are was published on 1 July 2010 and launched the following day at Ikon Gallery in Birmingham. It features the tale of a disenchanted local TV news anchor, who becomes obsessed with the unheralded deaths that he is routinely required to report as part of his day job. One of the stories he follows up has a curious connection to his own life and his seemingly ageless predecessor. O'Flynn was praised for being in this novel the \\"mistress of compassion\\" and \\"the JG Ballard of Birmingham...finding poetry and meaning where others see merely boredom and dereliction\\".https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/03/catherine-oflynn- news-where-review Her third book, Mr. Lynch's Holiday, was published on 1 August 2013, and tells the story of an estranged father and son, both emigrants from their respective homelands, but for very different reasons. Meeting up in an unfinished (but largely abandoned) housing development in Spain, both are in search of a connection with themselves and each other. The novel garnered numerous favourable reviews for its \\"brilliant wit and warmth\\",http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/books/fiction/article3832647.ece its \\"rare love story between a father and a son\\" and its treatment of \\"the absurdities of the credit boom\\",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/16/mr-lynchs-holiday-oflynn- review \\"excelling in exploring the strangeness of being the outsider and the stories people tell themselves to survive\\".http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/3c106916-05b8-11e3-8ed5-00144feab7de.html#axzz2d1Kb8wLF In 2011 she contributed a short story \\"The Stickiness of Lime Trees\\" to an anthology supporting The Woodland Trust. The anthology - Why Willows Weep - has so far helped The Woodland Trust plant approximately 50,000 trees, and is to be re-released in paperback format in 2016.

It makes the assumptions that the flow is mixed adiabatically and without friction. However, due to the mixing process, there is a net increase in the entropy of the system. Although there is an increase in entropy, the stream thrust averaged values are more representative of the flow than a simple average as a simple average would violate the second Law of Thermodynamics. Equations for a perfect gas Stream thrust: : F = \\\\int \\\\left(\\\\rho \\\\mathbf{V} \\\\cdot d \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\right) \\\\mathbf{V} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{f} +\\\\int pd \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{f}.

They must both be analyzed to determine which is the physical solution. One will usually be a subsonic root and the other a supersonic root. If it is not clear which value of velocity is correct, the second law of thermodynamics may be applied. : \\\\overline{\\\\rho} = {\\\\dot m \\\\over \\\\overline{U}A}, : \\\\overline{p} = {F \\\\over A} -{\\\\overline{\\\\rho} \\\\overline{U}^2}, : \\\\overline{h} = {\\\\overline{p} C_p \\\\over \\\\overline{\\\\rho} R}. Second law of thermodynamics: : abla s = C_p \\\\ln({\\\\overline{T}\\\\over T_1}) +R \\\\ln({\\\\overline{p} \\\\over p_1}). The values T_1 and p_1 are unknown and may be dropped from the formulation. The value of entropy is not necessary, only that the value is positive. : abla s = C_p \\\\ln(\\\\overline{T}) +R \\\\ln(\\\\overline{p}). One possible unreal solution for the stream thrust averaged velocity yields a negative entropy. Another method of determining the proper solution is to take a simple average of the velocity and determining which value is closer to the stream thrust averaged velocity.

He played with the band from 1993 to 1997 and rejoined in 2005. He has cited Gary Moore, Malcolm Young, Randy Rhoads, Eddie Van Halen, Tony Iommi and Steve Vai, among others, as his influences. He currently resides in Tampa, Florida.  Career  Barrett was born in Buffalo, New York. He started his professional career in 1990 when he formed the band Solstice with drummer Alex Marquez and guitar player Dennis Muñoz. The band recorded a demo in 1991 produced by Jim Morris and signed a record deal with the German label SPV/Steamhammer. In 1992 they released their debut album entitled Solstice. That same year, Barrett and Marquez decided to join Malevolent Creation, putting Solstice on hiatus. They took part on the recording of Retribution and toured with the band. =Cannibal Corpse= In 1993, Barrett was contacted by Alex Webster and asked to join Cannibal Corpse, shortly after the recording of Tomb of the Mutilated, as a lead guitar fill-in for Bob Rusay. He stayed with the band for the subsequent tours and eventually became a permanent member. He recorded the 1994 album The Bleeding and the 1996 album Vile. He also made a brief cameo appearance with the band in the 1994 film Ace Ventura: Pet Detective starring Jim Carrey. In 1997 Barrett left Cannibal Corpse after an argument over musical differences between him and the other band members. While he was replaced by Pat O'Brien, Barrett rejoined Malevolent Creation in 1998 and stayed with the band for six years. In 2005, Barrett expressed to the members of Cannibal Corpse his desire to come back to the band and after careful consideration, Barrett was finally welcomed back, switching to rhythm guitar and replacing Jack Owen. Since then, he has been featured on the albums Kill, Evisceration Plague, Torture, A Skeletal Domain and Red Before Black. Rob Barrett and Alex Webster =HatePlow= In 1994, Barrett formed the death metal band HatePlow with guitarist Phil Fasciana and late drummer \\"Crazy\\" Larry Hawke, both members of Malevolent Creation. Although HatePlow was intended initially as mere a fun side-project, the trio recorded a four-song demo that enjoyed a wide spread throughout the underground trading circuit. After his departure from Cannibal Corpse Barrett extended his commitment to HatePlow and participated in the recording of the albums Everybody Dies and The Only Law Is Survival which came out in 1998 and 2000 respectively. In 2004, he left HatePlow. =Collaborations and side- projects= Since the 2000s Barrett has made a few guest appearances, providing extra guitar playing for bands such as Eulogy, Hollenthon, Infernäl Mäjesty, Pro-Pain and Unearthed. In 2005 Barrett joined in on the recording of the Roadrunner United album The All-Star Sessions where he played guitar on the tracks \\"Annihilation by the Hands of God\\" and \\"Constitution Down\\". In 2019 Rob Barrett recorded with death metal band Deicide for a tribute album for the 40th anniversary of shock punk-metal hardcore legends The Dayglo Abortions titled \\"Fuck The World If It Can't Take a Joke\\". The track recorded was \\"Inside My Head\\" from their 1985 release Feed Us a Fetus.  Equipment  =Guitars= Barrett is currently endorsed by Dean Guitars and uses their custom guitars, mainly Cadillac's but also V's and ML's. All of his guitars are equipped with an EMG set and are tuned to Bb and Ab standard. Around 2007 Dean Guitars produced a signature model in limited numbers called the Cadi- Kill. In the past Barrett used to play on a Gibson Les Paul, a Jackson Dinky and a Charvel 750 XL. =Amplifiers= Like O'Brien, Barrett uses Mesa Boogie amplifiers, such as the Dual Rectifier, the Triple Rectifier and, more recently, Mark V. For cabinets, he uses Crate and Mesa Boogie 4 x 12\\", which are loaded with Celestion Vintage 30 speakers. Before settling for Mesa Boogie, Barrett used Crate and Marshall amplifiers. =Effects and accessories= Barrett runs a few pedals, namely a Boss NS-2 Noise Suppressor, MT-2 Metal Zone, TU-2 Chromatic Tuner and a Maxon ST-9 pro+ Super tube. The units are connected with Monster cables.

As the harbor was an important site of southern Changhua County in the late Qing era, the town was surrounded by fences and had defensive walls. In 1738, the first downtown street named Shezi Village was built in the southern bank of Dongluo River. In 1806, houses and fields along the downtown streets were all ruined due to the battle between immigrants from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou. In 1821, Shezi Village was rebuilt in the Baodou Village at the riverside. Geography It is located in an alluvial plain in the southeast part of the county. With an area of 19.2547 square kilometers, it is the second smallest township in the county after Xianxi Township.

Although modern-day Iran is a multi-ethnic country (e.g. Azeri wedding), Iranian wedding traditions are observed by the majority of ethnic groups in Iran. Before the wedding =Khastegāri (courtship) = Khastegāri () is the first step of the traditional Iranian courtship process. In olden times, when it was time for a young man to get married, his family would look for potential brides who came from families of similar standing in the community. Once the man, or his family, had decided on a potential bride, the Khastegāri process would take place. For this ceremony, one or more representatives of the man's family would visit the woman's family. The first visit could be for the parties to become acquainted. At each visit, the man's family would present a bouquet of flowers and the women, as good hostesses, would provide tea, fruits and sweets. Both the woman and the man had their say in whether or not they would like a follow-up on the visits. Once both parties had established serious intentions for the relationship, the man's family would bring sweets and a larger bouquet and officially pop the question. In modern Iran, this practice is initiated by the man and woman and their mutual decision to start the khastegari (courtship) process. The Khastegari is a one-time formality and it serves to inform the parents of the decision and have their thoughts shared in the process =Baleh Borān= Baleh Borān () is the ceremony which takes place shortly after the formal proposal, publicly announcing the couple's intention to form a union. At this stage, both man and woman are happy with each other and traditionally, both their families have agreed to the union and any conditions concerning the marriage. The groom's parents usually give a gift to the bride at this ceremony. According to an ancient Zoroastrian practice, this is done by the groom's family to persuade the bride to accept the proposal. The traditional gift is a ring. =Hanā Bandān (Henna Night)= Hana Bandān () is the ceremony held one day before the wedding in the house of either the bride or the groom, but It generally takes place at the bride's house and among women. Usually dry henna brought by the bridegroom's family is broken into pieces in a silver or copper vessel by a woman whose parents are alive, and still together . After preparing the bride, veil ornamented with red flake is placed over her head, and she is brought into the middle with hymn and folk songs about henna. Henna that has earlier kneaded with water is brought in on a tray surrounded by candles and placed in the middle of the room. In some places, the henna is first put on the hands of the bride and then distributed to the guests; in other areas the henna is first distributed to the guests, and only after everybody has left is it placed on the bride's hands. If the woman so wishes, henna can also be placed on her feet and hair. Considerable attention is paid to charging a woman with a happy marriage to knead and distribute the henna and apply it to the girl's hand. The woman places the henna on one of the bride's hands, and a young girl places it on the other. Before the henna is applied, coins or gold are also placed in her hands. After woman who came for dying henna leaves, close friend of the bride remain with her and enjoy themselves till morning. =Nāmzadi (engagement)= The Nāmzadi ceremony () takes place at the bride's family home. The man and woman, alongside their families, will determine \\"the gift of love\\", known as the Mehr/Mehrieh, as well as the date of the wedding. This may be held as early as a year before the wedding itself, in order to allow time for all the wedding arrangements to be made. The Iranian engagement ceremony, known as the Nāmzadi, involves the bride and groom exchanging rings, followed by a reception and/or party. =Shirini Khorān= Iranian 297x297px It is traditional to eat Bamieh sweet in the Shirini-Khoran The sharing of refreshments that follows the Nāmzadi ceremony ( literary. eating sweets). In this ceremony tea and Iranian desserts such as bāmiyeh (light doughnut balls), Nān-e berenji (rice flour cookies), chocolates, ājil (nuts and dried fruit), are served as part of the festivities. Eating sweet food stuffs at celebratory events such as an engagement ceremony carries symbolism such as wishing for sweetness in the couple's life in general. =Jahāz Barān= The Jahāz Barān () also known as Tabaq Barān () ceremony takes place a few days before the wedding, presents from the bride's family are taken over to the groom's house. Men from the groom's family dressed up in festive costumes carry the presents on elaborately decorated large flat containers carried on their heads. The containers are called tabaq (). This ceremony is also called Tabagh Bārān. Although this tradition might be practised in small towns and villages, in cities such as Tehran, an alternative means of transportation is used to deliver the gifts to the bride.  Wedding  =Sofreh Aghd (wedding table)= There is a very elaborate floor spread set up for Aghd, including several kinds of food and decorations, this is called Sofreh Aghd (). Items in the table include: * The Herbs: Khashkhash (poppy seeds), Berenj (rice), Sabzi Khoshk (Angelica), salt, Raziyane (Nigella seeds), Cha'i (black tea leaves) and Kondor (Frankincense). * The Pastries: Noghl, Baklava, Toot (Iranian marzipan), Naan-e Bereneji (rice cookies), Naan-e Badami (almond cookies) and Naan-Nokhodchi (chickpea cookie) are placed on the spread and traditionally served to the guests after the ceremony. * Mirror of Fate and two candelabras, symbols of light and fire. When the bride enters the room she has her veil covering her face. Once the bride sits beside the bridegroom she removes her veil and the first thing that the bridegroom sees in the mirror should be the reflection of his wife-to-be. * The Blessed Bread: A specially baked bread with calligraphy written on it. * \\"Naan-o Paneer-o Sabzi\\": Bread, feta cheese, and greens are also placed on the spread to symbolize the basic food that is needed to sustain life. They are traditionally served to guests after the ceremony. * Symbols of Fertility: decorated eggs, almonds, walnuts and hazelnuts. * The Heavenly Fruits: pomegranates, grapes, apples. * Coins: A bowl of gold or silver coins representing wealth and prosperity. * The Sacred Text: The Avesta, Qur'an, Bible, or Torah is placed in front of the couple on the spread. Some families also add a poetry book such as Rumi's Diwan-e Shams-e Tabrizi, Hafez's Divan, or the Shahnameh by Ferdowsi. * Prayer Rug: A prayer rug (Jaa-ye Namaaz) or a traditional Iranian Termeh is placed in the center of the wedding spread. The spreadprayer rug, open in the Aghd-cloth is to remind the couple of the importance of prayer to God. The prayer carpet also includes a small cube of clay with prayers written on it (Mohr) and a rosary (Tasbih). Non-Muslim families may or may not omit the prayer kit. A scarf or shawl made out of silk or any other fine fabric is held over the bride and bridegroom's heads (who are sitting by the Sofreh) by a few unmarried female relatives (bridesmaids). Two sugar cones made out of hardened sugar are used during the ceremony. These sugar cones are softly ground together above the bride and bridegroom's heads by a happily married female relative (and/or maid of honor) throughout the ceremony to shower them in sweetness. The sugar drops in the held fabric, not on their heads.  After the wedding  =Pātakhti= Traditionally, on Pātakhti () the bride wears a lot of floral ornaments and the decoration of the house with flowers is provided by the groom's family. It is similar to American Bridal shower. The relatives of the bride and the groom bring them presents. This is usually more of a party with finger foods, sweets and drink than a sit-down dinner. The majority of the night is spent dancing and socializing. =Pagoshā= Pagoshā (), (literally open leg) is a gesture of acceptance and open arms. It is a ceremony held in the house of newly married couple's relatives, In Iran, where families are a lot bigger and there are more of them around to throw parties, it is usually a very exciting and exhausting time for families of the bride and the groom who are invited to one Pagosha after another for several weeks following a wedding. =Mādarzan Salām= Mādarzan Salām () literally “hello mother in law” is generally the morning after the wedding ceremony when groom visits his mother in law and presents her with a gift. =Mah-e Asal (Iranian Honeymoon)= Mah-e Asal () is a vacation spent together by a newly married couple. Northern provinces of Iran such as Mazanderan, Golestan and Gilan are very popular honeymoon destinations. In recent years cities of Turkish Riviera such as Antalya and Alanya have been attracting more Iranian newlyweds because of no visa requirement between Iran and Turkey.

The decoding by British Naval intelligence of the Zimmermann telegram helped bring the United States into the war. Trench codes were used by field armies of most of the combatants (Americans, British, French, German) in World War I. The most commonly used codes were simple substitution codes. More important messages generally used mathematical encryption for extra security, though. The use of these codes required the distribution of codebooks to military personnel, which proved to be a security liability since these books could be stolen by enemy forces. Britain Zimmermann telegram as decoded by Room 40 British decrypting was carried out in Room 40 by the Royal Navy and in MI1 by British Military (Army) Intelligence. * Zimmermann telegram * Arthur Zimmermann * MI1 British Military (Army) Intelligence * Room 40 Royal Navy (Britain) * Alastair Denniston Room 40 * James Alfred Ewing Room 40, first head * Nigel de Grey Room 40 * William R.

He was eventually made chief cryptographer with the rank of admiral. With the Russian Revolution in 1917 he fled to Britain and was recruited to Room 40 in June 1918 to work on Austrian, Bolshevik and Georgian codes. * The Russians used an overcomplicated version of the Vigenère Cipher. It was broken within three days by Austro-Hungarian cryptanalyst Hermann Pokorny. France The French Army employed Georges Painvin, and Étienne Bazeries who came out of retirement, on German ciphers. Due to their prewar activities, the French were more prepared than any other nation involved in the war to decode German radiograms. At the beginning of the war, France had eight intercept stations: Maubeuge, Verdun, Toul, Epinal, Belfort, Lille, Rheims, and Besançon. During the war, they set up many more stations, including one in the Eiffel Tower. According to Colonel Cartier of the War Ministry, France intercepted over 100,000,000 words from German radiograms during the course of the war. * The Tableau de Concordance was the main French diplomatic cipher. Germany and Austria Germany and Austria intercepted Russian radio traffic, although German success at the Battle of Tannenberg (1914) was due to interception of messages between the Russian commanders in clear. The German Abhorchdienst, a code-breaking bureau composed mainly of mathematicians, was established in 1916. The Germans had specific regulations regarding which kinds of codes and ciphers could be used under given circumstances. Within three kilometers of the front lines, known as the danger zone, all communications were required to be in a code known as the three- number code. This was the only code or cipher permitted. Behind this danger zone, another code known as the three-letter code was allowed to be used. Communications between divisions, corps, and army headquarters were done with the ADFGVX cipher. The ADFGX and ADFGVX field ciphers were a modified polybius system with single order double columnar transposition and frequent key change, with letters optimized for Morse. It was later broken by the famous French cryptanalyst Georges Painvin. The breaking of the ADFGX cipher by Painvin was the second time during the war that cryptanalysis played a major role in shaping events (the first being the interception and cracking of the Zimmerman Telegram). By breaking the cipher, the French were able to decode an intercepted message about the forwarding of munitions for a German offensive, letting the French know where and when the offensive would occur, and thus allowing them to stop it. This message became known as \\"The Radiogram of Victory.\\" United States Herbert Yardley began as a code clerk in the State Department. After the outbreak of war he became the head of the cryptographic section of Military Intelligence Section (MI-8) and was with the American Expeditionary Force in World War I as a Signals Corps cryptologic officer in France. He later headed the Cipher Bureau, a new cryptanalysis group started in 1919, immediately after World War I, and funded jointly by the State Department and the US Army. Some American cryptography in World War I was done at the Riverbank Laboratory where Elizebeth Friedman, William F. Friedman and Agnes Meyer Driscoll worked. The Riverbank Laboratory, Chicago was privately owned by Colonel George Fabyan. The US Navy used the cryptographic code A-1. The US Navy cryptanalysis group, OP-20-G, was also started after World War I (in 1922). The US also started employing Indian code talkers in World War I, initially with members of the Cherokee and Choctaw tribes.

The main library is composed of two buildings, the East Building, with its dramatic atrium, and the Linn-Henley Research Library, with its fine wall murals, the Tutwiler Collection of Southern History, and the Rucker Agee Map Collection.  History  The Birmingham Public Library was established in 1886 as an adjunct of Birmingham's public schools. John H. Phillips, then superintendent of the public school system, set up a library in a room not much bigger than a closet. In 1913, a public library board was established, and the City of Birmingham assumed responsibility for funding the growing institution. In 1918 a branch specifically for the use of African-American residents opened, named after Booker T. Washington. The Booker T. Washington branch was headed by Mattie Herd Roland, the first African-American librarian in Alabama. The library was later moved to City Hall, where the collection burned in a fire in 1925. An impressive neo-classical building of Indiana limestone was completed in 1927 and served as the central facility of the Birmingham Public Library for 57 years. The city's library system was desegregated in April 1963, in part because of a lawsuit filed by the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights on behalf of Joe and Lola Hendricks.Graham, Patterson Toby. A Right to Read : Segregation and Civil Rights in Alabama's Public Libraries, 1900-1965, University of Alabama Press, 2002. P. 84 Exterior of the Linn-Henley Research Library To accommodate the growing collection and demand for services, an additional structure containing of floor space was completed in 1984 and connected to the original building via a crosswalk. This building houses most of the Central Library's circulating and general reference collections, plus the technical services for the library system. The original 1927 building was renovated in 1985 and renamed the Linn-Henley Research Library. This facility houses the library's special collections, and government publications. Together these two buildings comprise the Central Library of the Birmingham Public Library system. The Entrance to the Linn-Henley Research Library North side of the main research room showing part of one of the Ezra Winter Murals in the Linn-Henley Research Library. In addition to the Central Library, the Birmingham Public Library system includes 20 branches located elsewhere in the city. This branch system was begun when the Birmingham library began to integrate libraries from independent communities that gradually became incorporated into Birmingham. In the 1980s the library board had adopted plans to build regional libraries that would serve large sections of the city, would have larger collections and facilities, and would be opened more hours. Over the years, it has matured and today serves a populace diverse in interests, needs, and age. Scholars and other researchers are drawn to the archival materials, the extensive genealogical materials, and the local and southern history resources, while students and other citizens expect current and broad- based reference information, up-to-date popular materials and innovative online services. Annual circulation of roughly 1.7 million checkouts is matched by an equal number of materials being used within the libraries and via electronic access. Birmingham Public Library accounts for 46% of the circulation in the Jefferson County Library Cooperative, which posts a combined circulation of almost 3.7 million items checked out annually. The cooperative agreement that Birmingham Public Library shares with the other municipal public libraries of Jefferson County, Alabama greatly increases the number of library materials available to all library members. In fact, the Jefferson County Library Cooperative is a model for how separate governments can work together to provide a public service across city boundaries.  Major collections and services  Tutwiler Collection of Southern History and Literature, listed as one of the top 10 public library collections for genealogists by Family Tree Magazine, is a collection that covers every facet of Southern life and culture. If you are interested in Alabama or Southern regional history, arts and sciences, geography, genealogy, or folklore you can find information on all these subjects in the Tutwiler Collection. There are extensive newspaper clipping files on local and regional history that can be searched for information along with periodicals and online databases. Other collections of note included are the Caribbean Collection, the Rucker Agee Map Collection, and the Rare Book Collection of early Americana. In 2006, Digital Collections was initiated to preserve and make available the local history of Birmingham and the surrounding area. Virtual Library Services via the Internet include online databases, eBooks and downloadable audiobooks, Ask A Librarian, blogs and RSS feeds and other Internet resources. Public Computing Services include public access computers at all locations and free wireless access to the Internet via Wi-Fi available at the Central Library, Avondale Branch, Five Points West Branch, North Birmingham Branch, Springville Road Branch and West End Branch.  Library events  Alabama Bound is an annual book and author fair that celebrates Alabama authors and publishers. Hosted by the Birmingham Public Library, it is a meeting place where fans may meet their favorite authors, buy their books and hear them read from and talk about their work. Book signings follow each presentation.

His mother bought him an acoustic guitar for Christmas. Later, when he started to practice more he received his first electric guitar, a Gibson SG copy. His father also bought him a 1974 Gibson Flying V. His influences include AC/DC, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Mercyful Fate and Metallica. As a guitarist, O'Brien is formally trained, having studied classical guitar. He gave lessons at Buddy Rogers Music, a music store in Florence, Kentucky, where he encouraged his students to listen to jazz, classical, fusion, country and blues and not focus solely on metal. He recalls that his interest in classical guitar probably came from a concert of Andrés Segovia he attended with his father. Segovia remains O'Brien's favourite guitarist and his main inspiration. =Career= started playing in a series of bands, sometimes as a touring musician and sometimes as a full-time member. Throughout the 1980s he played in heavy metal bands such as Chastain and Prizoner. In the 1990s evolved from heavy metal to death metal. Between 1990 and 1992 he played in the Cincinnati-based death/thrash metal band Ceremony alongside Steve Tucker, Greg Reed and Shannon Purdon. They released a demo in 1992 entitled Ceremony, and an EP called The Days before the Death that did not come out before 2000 and for which did the mastering with Mark Prator. After the band's breakup, decided to move out of Cincinnati. He relocated to Los Angeles and searched for a new band. Through tape trading he eventually got hired by Nevermore, who at the time were looking for a second guitarist. stayed in the band for two years during which they recorded the EP In Memory and the full-length The Politics of Ecstasy which both came out in 1996. He also toured with the band and took part in a video shoot for the song \\"What Tomorrow Knows\\" from Nevermore's eponymous debut album. However, he felt unsatisfied with the band, preferring to be involved in death metal. Following his departure from Nevermore, went through a transitional period where he briefly joined Monstrosity as a touring member but remained somewhat inactive for the rest of the time. =Cannibal Corpse= In 1997 he was approached by Cannibal Corpse through several relations. After auditioning for the band, ultimately became a permanent member replacing Rob Barrett.http://www.allmusic.com/artist/nevermore-p13783/biography He has been featured on every Cannibal Corpse album since Gallery of Suicide. Since his involvement in Cannibal Corpse, has been credited on some of the band's more technically complicated songs. One song which has been cited by other band members, both past and current, as the most difficult Cannibal Corpse song is \\"Frantic Disembowelment\\" from the album The Wretched Spawn. To this day the band has performed this song live only once. has often been complimented by his co-members and other musicians in the death metal scene for his proficiency. In the documentary DVD Centuries of Torment: The First 20 Years bassist Alex Webster stated that \\"Some of his rhythm parts are as difficult as a solo might be in another band.\\" Drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz commended his contribution to the band's music, stating \\"He really is a vital part of the Cannibal [Corpse] sound. His songs are awesome and we definitely need his songs on our CDs.\\" himself admitted that he tends to write more technical songs but often regards it as a by-product of the songwriting process rather than an aim in itself.Korycki, Denise (2009) \\"The Making Of Evisceration Plague\\", Evisceration Plague (Bonus DVD) However unlike Webster and Mazurkiewicz, does not take part in the composition of lyrics and instead focuses on the music. =Slayer= In April 2011 filled in for Exodus' Gary Holt when Holt left the Slayer European tour to play with his own band. Holt himself had been filling in for the now deceased Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman since February 26, 2011, subsequently joining the band. =Guest appearances= made several guest appearances as lead guitarist. He collaborated on Leather's solo debut album Shock Waves which came out in 1989.

In 2008 played guitar on the song \\"Race Against Disaster\\" on Jeff Loomis's debut solo album Zero Order Phase. In the same year he made a guest solo appearance on Kataklysm's album Prevail. Arrest On December 10, 2018, O'Brien was arrested in Tampa for burglary of a house in the 4700 block of Windflower Circle near the Northdale Golf and Country and for assault on a responding deputy. Reports showed that around 6:57 p.m., he entered a home without permission from its two unidentified occupants. After one occupant told him to leave, O'Brien pushed a woman to the ground, left the house and hid in the property's backyard until police arrived. A responding deputy gave him orders; instead of complying, charged at the deputy with a knife. The deputy then tased him, taking him into custody afterward. He was booked into the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office on charges of burglary with assault or battery and aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer, and was being held without bail. The burglarized home is in the same area of a golf course where a house fire broke out about the same time at 16311 Norwood Dr., the house O'Brien was renting. It was not immediately clear if the fire was connected to his arrest. At O'Brien's court appearance on the morning of December 11, he wore an anti-suicide vest with his wrists and ankles chained together. His bail was set at $50,000 and was told by a judge that he would need to pass a drug test to see if he could be bonded out of jail. O'Brien could face up to 30 years in prison just on the charge of aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer with a deadly weapon. The burglary charge could see a fine of up to $10,000 and a maximum of life in prison. Flamethrowers, numerous weapons and ammunition that had caught fire and exploded were recovered inside O'Brien's home. One neighbor said that he seemed \\"just like a regular neighbor. Get out of the car, go right into the house. That's about it.\\" Another neighbor was terrified by the incident, but was thankful that the fire crew came in time to put the flames out before spreading to other homes. A crowdfunding campaign for O'Brien was launched by drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz's wife Deana. She stated that he \\"does not have insurance, and lost everything that he owns. These funds will help him get back on his feet with the regular much-needed necessities like clothing, a roof over his head, and other daily life necessities that are needed.\\" O'Brien was released from jail on December 14 after posting bond. The day after the fire subsided, fire marshals found a massive amount of weapons, locked safes and potential explosive devices in O'Brien's possession. The list of weapons found included 50 shotguns, 10 semi-automatic rifles (including a couple variants of AK-47s), two Uzi-style rifles and 20 handguns. Other materials found were a number of locked safes, two flamethrowers, thousands of rounds of ammunition that were stored in boxes, several other weapons with their parts and three skulls. One of the weapons was illegal to possess, a sawed-off shotgun (off to about an inch past the stock.) The search warrant that was issued did not state if O'Brien had paperwork for his cache. However, the state of Florida does not require a permit to purchase or possess a firearm. Cannibal Corpse expressed their respects for O'Brien, but would not release any further information regarding the incident, and that he \\"is getting the help he needs and appreciates the love and support from Cannibal Corpse fans around the world.\\" They then said that O'Brien is looking forward to a future return to the band and that their tours and shows would continue as planned. Cannibal Corpse vocalist George \\"Corpsegrinder\\" Fisher spoke out and said that he was shocked to hear about O'Brien's arrest and that the fans have expressed their support for him. He also said that he broke down upon seeing him in court wearing the anti-suicide vest, and that the band expressed their support for him as well. Equipment Plays mostly Jackson Custom Shop V's (as of 2017) which are equipped with a Fishman Fluence Modern pickup in the bridge position and a Floyd Rose bridge. When on tour, he takes four guitars, one for the different tunings and a spare. In Cannibal Corpse currently uses two tunings: A# standard and G# standard. Both companies have released their respective Pat signature model. Throughout his career has always preferred to use V shaped guitar. Other guitars included in his collection are: *Jackson Custom Shop Double Rhoads V *Jackson Custom Shop King V (Older Guitars Used) *B.C. Rich JR V 7 string, *B.C. Rich JR V baritone, *Gibson Flying V (1979 and 1981), *Jackson Randy Rhoads, *RAN Invader. For amplification uses Mesa Boogie Triple Rectifier (2 channel) amplifier heads with 4x12 cabinets, some of which are loaded with Celestion Vintage 30 speakers and others which are loaded with Electro-Voice EVM12L Black Label Zakk Wylde speakers. He also uses a number of effect pedals such as a Robert Keeley modified Boss MT-2 Metal Zone, ISP Technologies Decimator Noise Reduction, Dunlop Crybaby Wah and a Boss Octaver.

The Mira Gino replaced the Mira Classic which is a subvariant of the L500 series Mira. The second generation model was also exported as the Daihatsu Trevis to some markets in Europe such as Germany, the Netherlands, Italy and France. __TOC__  First generation (L700; 1999)  The first generation Mira Gino was introduced in 1999 and was available in either three or five-door versions. The car is based on the L700 series Mira, which was produced between 1998 and 2002. The car was originally only available with the 658 cc EF series inline-three petrol engine, in naturally aspirated or turbocharged. Either front- or four-wheel drive is available. The styling evoked the design of the Compagno and the classic Mini. An unusual development was the installation of the European market 989 cc EJ- VE inline-three petrol engine in the Mira Gino 1000, presented in August 2002. This version no longer fit into the \\"kei\\" class because of its larger engine and was also marginally longer and wider due to the installation of bumper overriders and fender trim.

The airport serves all the local and as well as the tourists. Upgrade The airport is in process of being upgraded to an international airport, in order to attract more tourists, which will make it the fourth international airport in Bangladesh. The two phases of upgrading, will make the airport able to provide better facilities for parking, landing and take- off for wide-body aircraft such as B777 or A330. The first phase of upgrading cost was . The second phase of upgrading cost is US $230 million. In 2012 under the first phase the airport's runway expanded from 6,790 feet to 9,000 feet, and widened from 150 feet to 200 feet. The runway's load capability will be strengthened for wide-body operation, while the runway lighting will also get an upgrade. Equipment such as instrument landing system, distance measuring equipment, AMeDAS and VOR will be installed. Aircraft Refueling (JET A-1 ) Facilities is available from February 2017 by Standard Asiatic Oil Company Limited, an Enterprise of Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation. Under 2nd phase the runway will be expanded from 9000ft to 11000 ft. Inspired by Hong Kong International Airport, the government in Bangladesh took the ambitious project to expand the runway at the Cox’s Bazar airport by reclaiming land from the sea in a bid to woo tourists to the beach town. Building such a runway on sea is not only expensive but only a few companies in the world have the expertise to construct runways extending from shore to sea.

Early life McCarthy was born in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, the eldest child of William Frederick McCarthy, a solicitor, and his Sydney-born wife, Emma Mary à Beckett. McCarthy was educated at Springfield College, Sydney, and passed with honours the University of Sydney's senior examination. After her father's death in 1881 she helped her mother to rear her brothers and sisters.Biodata, adb.online.anu.edu.au; accessed 6 March 2016. Nursing career By 1891, McCarthy was in England, and on 10 October 1891, entered London Hospital, Whitechapel, to begin general nursing training as a probationer. Hospital records state that \\"she had an exceptionally nice disposition\\" and was \\"most ladylike and interested in her work\\" although \\"she found it hard to control others, or to take firm action when necessary\\". She was nonetheless promoted to sister in January 1894. McCarthy was Nursing Sister-in-Charge of the Sophia Women's Ward at the outbreak of the Second Boer War, and was one of the six sisters selected from London Hospital by Princess Alexandra to go to South Africa as her own \\"military\\" nursing sisters. Resigning from the hospital on 25 December 1899, McCarthy served with distinction throughout 1899–1902 with the Army Nursing Service Reserve, receiving the Queen's and the King's Medal and the Royal Red Cross. Returning to England in July 1902, she was awarded a special decoration by Queen Alexandra. She then became involved in the formation of Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service, was promoted matron within the service in February 1903 and during the next seven years was successively matron of Aldershot, Netley and Millbank military hospitals. In 1910 she was appointed principal matron at the War Office, a position she held until the outbreak of the First World War. McCarthy sailed in the first ship to leave England with members of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), arriving in France on 12 August 1914. In 1915 she was installed at Abbeville as matron-in-chief of the BEF in France and Flanders, taking charge of the whole area from the Channel to the Mediterranean, wherever British and allied nurses worked; she was directly responsible to General Headquarters. In August 1914, the numbers in her charge were 516; by the time of the Armistice they were over 6,000. She was responsible for the nursing of hundreds of thousands of casualties from 1914 to 1918. McCarthy was the only head of a department in the BEF who remained in her original post throughout the war, although she was off-duty with appendicitis from March–August 1917. She was appointed Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire in 1918, received a Bar to her Royal Red Cross and was awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal, the Belgian Medaille de la Reine Elisabeth, and the French Légion d'honneur and Medaille des Epidémies. When she left France on 5 August 1919, representatives from the French government and the medical services saw her off. The meticulous records kept since her arrival in France were taken to England with her. Describing the matron-in-chief during the war, one general said:'\\"She's perfectly splendid, she's wonderful ... she's a soldier! ... If she was made Quartermaster-General, she'd work it, she'd run the whole Army, and she'd never get flustered, never make a mistake. The woman's a genius.\\" A contributor to the Sydney Morning Herald in 1914 referred to her as a \\"slight, delicately-organised woman\\" with \\"an absolutely wonderful gift for concentrated work, and a power of organisation that has made her invaluable in army hospital work\\". She was matron-in-chief of the Territorial Army Nursing Service from 1920 until her retirement in 1925. Personal life McCarthy never married, and died at her home at Chelsea, London on 1 April 1949, aged 89. A pastel portrait of her by Austin Spare hangs in the Imperial War Museum. In 2014 she was honoured by having a blue plaque placed on her Chelsea former home. References * J. Piggott.

It is a predatory fish that mostly ranges at depths between , and is found in the cold northern Atlantic, northern Pacific, and Arctic Oceans. It has a variety of other English vernacular names, including black halibut, blue halibut, lesser halibut, and Newfoundland turbot; while both Newfoundland turbot and Greenland turbot are in common use in North America (sometimes even without the location, just \\"turbot\\"), these names are typically not used in Europe, where they can cause easy confusion with the true turbot (Scophthalmus maximus). The Greenland halibut supports important fisheries and it is caught in large quantities. Disputes over the fishing rights for this species in the Atlantic Ocean off Canada caused the Turbot War in the mid-1990s (a \\"war\\" without any injuries or casualties). The Greenland halibut is a flatfish, and the left eye has migrated during the fish's development so that it is on the right side of the head. However, in this fish, it has not moved as far as in bottom-dwelling flatfish and the fish can probably see forwards. The Greenland halibut can swim in a vertical position and both sides of its body are a speckled brown colour, but the left side is rather paler than the right. The Hellefisk Fjord in Greenland is named after this fish. Description Its morphology with the left eye positioned on the dorsal ridge of the forehead gives it an appearance of a cyclops when looking straight at it. The central position of the left eye in the Greenland halibut probably gives it a much wider range of peripheral vision in comparison to other flatfish, where the eye has migrated completely. Its body shape is elongated and compressed dorsoventrally and muscles on both sides are equally developed. Both sides are pigmented, but the left blind side is slightly lighter in color than the right side. The maximum length is about and the maximum weight is about , the normal length is and they usually weigh . Its physical appearance suggests it to be a vigorous swimmer that can swim in a vertical position. Vertical swimming has been observed during tagging experiments. However, video analysis of Greenland halibut behavior in front of a bottom trawl showed no sign of swimming in a vertical position. Though most Greenland halibut are caught in bottom-fishing gear (trawl, longline and gillnet), they have also been caught in surface drift nets, which indicates that they can have a pelagic occurrence. Stomach analysis has also shown that their diet consists mostly of pelagic or bathypelagic organisms. Though the Greenland halibut is a flatfish, it does at times behave more like a roundfish. Distribution and habitat The Greenland halibut is a cold-water species found at depths from near the surface to , but mainly between . It is mainly found in waters with temperatures from , but has also been observed at subzero temperatures down to . It has a circumpolar distribution in the Northern Hemisphere and is found in both the North Atlantic and the North Pacific Oceans. In the North Pacific, it ranges from the Sea of Japan near Honshu northwards to the Chukchi Sea, east through the Aleutian Islands, and south as far as northern Baja California in Mexico. In the North Atlantic, it occurs from the British Isles to northern Norway, Faroe Islands, Iceland, and eastern Greenland in the east and from Newfoundland to northwestern Greenland in the west. Biology Close-up of the head, showing the strong teeth of this predatory species (upperside of fish on left, underside on right) Although primarily a bottom fish, it is often caught pelagically and it is thought to swim on its ventral edge rather than on the blind side. It is an active, midwater predator that feeds on prawns, fish (such as Atlantic cod, Artic cod, eelpouts, capelin, and redfish), and squid. It spawns at depths of during spring and summer, from April to July at temperatures of . Its eggs, larvae, and postlarvae are free-floating in deep water. The larvae complete their metamorphosis on attaining a length of ; the young fish tend to occur in shallower areas than the adults.  Fishing and conservation  The species is not threatened overall and it can be locally abundant, but it is near threatened. Until the 1970s, the species declined due to overfishing, but since the 1980s, an overall slight increase has been seen, although some local populations have further declined. The primary threat is overfishing. The species is a prolific breeder with each female producing tens to hundreds of thousands of eggs, but this only happens when reaching maturity around 5 years or older (sometimes even 15 years), making it vulnerable to overexploitation. Secondary threats are related to their deep-water spawning grounds. Some are in areas with oil and gas extraction. Others spawning grounds are in deep near-shore regions where the ecosystem relies on nutrients from meltwater from glaciers, but these are gradually disappearing. In 2010, Greenpeace International added the Greenland halibut to its seafood red list because some fishing for the Greenland halibut is by bottom trawl, which can cause significant environmental damage, and some populations appear to be overfished.Greenpeace International Seafood Red list In coastal regions and some offshore regions, fishing for Greenland halibut mainly is done by deep- sea long line fishing (out of reach of seabirds and too cold for sea turtles, issues for this fishing type elsewhere in shallower and warmer waters) and stationary bottom gillnets, which does not cause the same damage as bottom trawling. In 2017, the Marine Stewardship Council certified that the fishery for Greenland halibut was sustainable. Because Canada and Greenland share the offshore populations in the Davis Strait–Baffin Bay region in between them, the two have shared the fishing quota and follow the same guidelines in this region. Offshore populations in this region are healthy, stable and well- managed, but in more coastal areas some populations have fallen due to overfishing, although they do get a regular input of young fish from the stable offshore populations. Deals on fishing quotas for offshore fishing for Greenland halibut and other species have also been reached between Greenland, Faroe Islands, Norway, and Russia. Among well-monitored populations, the ones in the East Greenland–Iceland region (i.e., Greenland Sea, Denmark Strait and nearby) experienced the greatest decline since the 1970s. In 2019, the parties agreed on a reduction of fishing for Greenland halibut in the Greenland Sea region, following recommendations by biologists. In some inshore waters of Greenland, fishing quotas for Greenland halibut have been temporarily raised several times, contrary to recommendations by fisheries biologists, and leading to recommendations of a clearer separation of decisions on quotas and the Greenlandic Government (decisions not fully left to Greenland's Fisheries Commission). A smaller fishery for the species also exists in the Gulf of Alaska (where relatively uncommon) and the Bering Sea region (where more common), and these populations are not overfished. Since 1990, the annual total landings reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization have ranged between . In 1999, the largest catches were from Greenland and Norway. These, along with Canada, Iceland and Russia, account for about 75% of the catches of Greenland halibut. Other countries with significant catches of this species are the United States, Faroe Islands, Scotland, Germany, Portugal, and Spain (the last three using EU-quotas). Fishing is the most important industry in Greenland and Greenland halibut is the second-most important species (after northern prawn), meaning that any changes can have a significant effect on the country's overall economy, as well as the local economy as most inshore fisheries are by small-scale, small-boat fishers. Similarly, the fishery for Greenland halibut is very important to some First Nations and Inuit communities in Canada. In 2001, were landed in Scotland with a value estimated at £1,885,000. The oil-rich, soft meat is regarded as good, but inferior to that of the Atlantic halibut and European turbot. Traditionally, it was salted, but today it is mostly smoked or frozen and the primary market is in East Asia, where it is regarded as a delicacy. However, because of the thick skin, high fat content, and low meat yield, as much as one-third of the fish can be lost in production. In Greenland, the remains are often used as food for the sled dogs (Greenland dogs).

It is a large bolete from Western North America with distinguishing features that include a netted surface on the stem, a red to brown cap and stem color, and red pores that stain blue upon injury. Until 2005 this was the only bolete that has been implicated in the death of someone consuming it; a couple developed gastrointestinal symptoms in 1994 after eating this fungus with the husband succumbing. Autopsy revealed infarction of the midgut. Taxonomy American mycologists Harry D. Thiers and Roy E. Halling were aware of confusion on the west coast of North America over red-pored boletes; two species were traditionally recognised—Boletus satanas and Boletus eastwoodiae. However, they strongly suspected the type specimen of the latter species was in fact the former. In reviewing material they published a new name for the taxon, which Thiers had written about in local guidebooks as B. eastwoodiae, as they felt that name to be invalid. Hence in 1976 they formally described Boletus pulcherrimus, from the Latin pulcherrimus, meaning \\"very pretty\\". It was transferred to the genus Rubroboletus in 2015 along with several other allied reddish colored, blue-staining bolete species such as B. eastwoodiae and B. satanas. Description Colored various shades of olive- to reddish-brown, the cap may sometimes reach in diameter and is convex in shape before flattening at maturity. The cap surface may be smooth or velvety when young, but may be scaled in older specimens; the margin of the cap is curved inwards in young specimens but rolls out and flattens as it matures. Close-up of the poroid surfaceThe cap may reach a thickness of when mature. The adnate (attached squarely to the stem) poroid surface is bright red to dark red or red-brown and bruise dark blue or black; there are 2 to 3 pores per mm in young specimens, and in maturity they expand to about 1 or 2 per mm. In cross section, the tubes and flesh are yellow. The tubes are between long, while the angular pores are up to 1 mm in diameter; pores can range in color from dark red in young specimens to reddish brown in age. The pores will stain a blue color when cut or bruised. The solid, firm stem is 7–20 cm (3–8 in) long and thick—up to in diameter, at the base before tapering to 2–5 cm (1–2 in) at the top. It is yellow or yellow-brown in color and bears a network of red reticulations on the upper 2/3 of its length. The spore print is olive-brown. The taste of the flesh is reportedly mild, and the odor indistinct, or \\"slightly fragrant\\". ; Microscopic characters The spores are spindle-shaped or elliptical, thick-walled, smooth, and have dimensions of 13–16 by 5.5–6.5 μm. The basidia, the spore-bearing cells, are club-shaped (clavate), attached to 1 to 4 spores, and have dimensions of 35–90 by 9–12 μm. The cystidia (sterile, non-spore-bearing cells found interspersed among the basidia) in the hymenium have dimensions of 33–60 by 8–12 μm. Clamp connections are absent in the hyphae of B. pulcherrimus. =Similar species= Although the relatively large fruiting bodies of R. pulcherrimus are distinctive, they might be confused with superficially similar species, such as Rubroboletus eastwoodiae; the latter species has a much thicker stalk. Another similar species is R. haematinus, which may be distinguished by its yellower stem and cap colors that are various shades of brown. Its darker cap and lack of reticulation on the stipe differentiate it from R. satanas. Neoboletus luridiformis grow with oaks but is smaller and have non-reticulate stipe. Distribution and habitat R. pulcherrimus has a stem that is finely netted (reticulate) Rubroboletus pulcherrimus is found in western North America, from New Mexico and California to Washington, and may feasibly occur in British Columbia, Canada. One source notes it grows at low altitudes in the Cascade Range and Olympic Mountains; another claims it grows at high elevations, over . Fruiting in autumn, it grows singly or in groups (although another source claims \\"never in groups\\") in humus in mixed woodlands. In the original publication describing the species, Thiers and Halling note that it is associated with forests containing tanbark oaks (Lithocarpus densiflora), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and Grand Fir (Abies grandis). Smith and Weber mention increased fruitings after warm heavy fall rains following a humid summer. Toxicity In general, blue-staining red-pored boletes should be avoided for consumption. Thiers warned this species may be toxic after being alerted to severe gastrointestinal symptoms in one who had merely tasted it. Years later, in 1994, a couple developed gastrointestinal symptoms after eating this fungus and the husband died as a result. A subsequent autopsy revealed that the man had suffered an infarction of the midgut. Rubroboletus pulcherrimus was the only bolete that had been implicated in the death of someone consuming it, in: It is known to contain low levels of muscarine, a peripheral nervous system toxin. A 2005 report from Australia recorded a fatality from muscarinic syndrome after consuming a mushroom from the genus Rubinoboletus.

It covers the period of 1375-1425 and focuses on the ascent of the Tocco family, and especially Carlo I Tocco, Count palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos, to the rule over the Despotate of Epirus, as well as Carlo's conquest of territories in the Morea. The author, who remains unknown, described events that occurred during his own lifetime and must have been present in some of them. He possibly belonged to the court of Carlo I Tocco and came from Ioannina. From the text we can deduce that he was not particularly educated since he was using simple language. The author describes the Toccos as fair governors, who care for the rights of their people. It is remarkable, that he does not mention the Latin descent of the noble family. He appears to cultivate a sense of early Greek nationalism and to hate the Albanians. The Chronicle was published for the first time in 1975 by Giuseppe Schirò (Cronaca dei Tocco di Cefalonia; prolegomeni, testo critico e traduzione, Corpus Fontium Historiae Byzantinae 10.

Kobe Bryant became popular again, during and after the 2008 summer olympics. * Baseball in the United States undergoes controversy and Congressional scrutiny due to steroids; stars such as Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire, ranked #1 and #2 in single-season home runs, are suspected to have used steroids, while others such as Jason Giambi and Rafael Palmeiro are confirmed to have been using the drugs. Thanks to two consecutive years of Boston Red Sox–New York Yankees American League Championship Series, however, ratings and popularity for the sport (while lower than previous years) still remain high. * The National Hockey League suffers a lockout that wiped out the entire 2005 season, as well a television deal with OLN that prevented many fans from being able to see games (several NHL telecasts on OLN were outdrawn by WNBA games on ESPN2 ). * NASCAR Racing becomes more mainstream as TV ratings for the sport grows in the U.S.. NASCAR races regularly outdraw NBA, MLB and NHL telecasts by over 200 percent (in fact, NASCAR's average rating in 2005 outdid the combined regular season averages for the NBA and Major League Baseball during that same year). TV networks such as Fox, NBC, ABC, and TNT air races on a regular basis on Sundays and sometimes Saturday nights. Popular drivers during this period include Jimmie Johnson, Matt Kenseth, Tony Stewart, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Jeff Gordon, and Kasey Kahne. * American Football continues to become more popular; Super Bowl XLI, in which the Indianapolis Colts defeated the Chicago Bears 29-17 becomes the third most watched television event in the US market ever. The NFL also draws criticism, especially following the Super Bowl XXXVIII fiasco, the Terrell Owens controversy in 2004 and 2005, and the Michael Vick dogfighting fallout in 2007. The NFL undergoes significant upheaval in its international activity, discontinuing NFL Europa but holding regular season games outside the US in Mexico City, London and Toronto. College Football is popular with stars such as Tim Tebow, Matt Leinert, Vince Young, Reggie Bush and Darren McFadden. American Football's biggest flop of the decade was Vince McMahon's XFL which was born and die in 2001. * The Boston Red Sox break the 86 year \\"Curse of the Bambino\\" by defeating the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004 World Series (they also won in 2007). The following year the Chicago White Sox beat the Houston Astros to win the 2005 World Series, winning their first since 1917. * Horse racing in the United States enjoys a surge in ratings, thanks to three straight years of Triple Crown hopefuls (War Emblem, Funny Cide and Smarty Jones in 2002, 2003 and 2004). However, all three horses fail to win the Triple Crown, and the next hopeful (Barbaro in 2006) is severely injured during the Preakness. * Beach volleyball becomes an increasingly popular sport worldwide, establishing its first generation of superstars and branching out into large inland cities. * Football begins to gain popularity amongst North Americans and Australians, fuelled by World Cup successes for the USA in 2002 and Australia in 2006. Previously, North America and Australia had been considered the only continents to not have pertinent followers of World Football. * A basketball game between the Indiana Pacers and Detroit Pistons is called almost 50 seconds early due to a massive fan- player brawl, an event which became known as Pacers–Pistons brawl. * Many British football clubs are being bought by Eastern European millionaires such as Chelsea by Roman Abramovich, Hearts by Vladimir Romanov and Portsmouth F.C. by Milan Mandarić and Alexandre Gaydamak. * The IRB Rugby World Cup increases in size and audience to become the third most watched sporting event in the world after the FIFA World Cup and The Summer Olympics respectively. * WADA, The World Anti-doping Agency, introduces a standardised anti-doping code for all sports. * P.R. China's sportsmen make continuous improvements in several sports, in preparation for the Beijing (北京) Olympic Games. * Professional wrestling, which had separate golden ages in the 1980s and 1990s, begins to decline in popularity in North America. Many attribute this decline to the monopoly on the industry held by World Wrestling Entertainment after the collapse of both World Championship Wrestling and Extreme Championship Wrestling in 2001, with WWE acquiring the remains of both companies. However, WWE would revive ECW as a third brand alongside its RAW and SmackDown! brands in 2006 due to increased nostalgia. Because of the WWE's monopoly and the internet helping to spread word, a trend begins with smaller independent promotions garnering many fans during the decade. During this period Total Nonstop Action Wrestling attempts to create an alternative to the WWE product with little success. The deaths of WWE stars Eddie Guerrero in 2005 and Chris Benoit in 2007, gave the WWE mainstream publicity. WWE continues to be popular overseas during this period, which prompts them to increase the number of televised foreign shows. Female wrestlers gain more exposure with the WWE expanding its women's division and adding a second women's championship, the Divas title. Later in the decade, women's wrestling also gains exposure and credibility through TNA creating their own division, and with the all-female promotion Shimmer Women Athletes. Ring of Honor essentially establishes itself as the number three company in the United States. Finally, in puroresu, a mass exodus occurs in All Japan Pro Wrestling in 2000, with almost all contracted employees following Mitsuharu Misawa to form Pro Wrestling Noah later that year. Many figures have been: Triple H, Randy Orton, Ric Flair, Batista, Edge, John Cena, The Undertaker. Shawn Michaels, Jeff and Matt Hardy, and Chris Jericho. * In light of the waning popularity of professional wrestling and boxing, mixed martial arts competitions such as the Ultimate Fighting Championship and Pride Fighting Championships gain popularity in the United States.Top stars such as Chuck Liddell, Randy Couture and Tito Ortiz become household names and the UFC is featured on the May cover of Sports Illustrated. However boxing still retains a healthy following, with exciting and popular fighters including Oscar De La Hoya, Sugar Shane Mosley, Joe Calzaghe, Floyd Mayweather, Jr., Diego Corrales, Manny Pacquiao, and many others. Many exciting fights have also taken place. * Rugby league in Australia enjoys increasing popularity amongst the Eastern states, with record crowd figures almost yearly from 2003 onwards. The national competition, the National Rugby League, has 6 different winners in the space of 6 seasons. * The New Zealand Kiwis defeated the Australian Kangaroos in the finals of the 2005 Rugby League Tri-Nations of the 2008 Rugby League World Cup. These victories put an end to Australia's dominance in international rugby league - one of the strongest in world sport. 2005 was the first time Australia had failed to win a series or tournament since 1978. 2008 was the first time New Zealand won the World Cup and the first time Australia failed to win the World Cup since 1972. * In the NFL, the New England Patriots, led by head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady, win three championships in four years ('01, '03, and '04). In 2007, the Patriots become the first team to go 16-0 in the regular season before losing to the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII. In 2008, the Detroit Lions became the first team to go 0-16 in a season. The Pittsburgh Steelers also had a great run during 2001-2010, winning two Super Bowls, six division titles, and three conference titles. * A 2003 revival of roller derby in Austin, Texas, leads to the rise of the fastest growing sport of the decade, with over 450 new roller derby leagues forming worldwide. * At 2009 in the 121st IOC Session golf and rugby union (specifically the sevens version) readmitted to the Olympic program in 2016. = Olympic Games = Five Olympic Games were held in this decade 2000 XXVII Summer Olympics - Sydney, Australia (most gold medal wins USA) 2002 XIX Winter Olympics - Salt Lake City, USA (most gold medal wins Norway) 2004 XXVIII Summer Olympics - Athens, Greece (most gold medal wins USA) 2006 XX Winter Olympics - Turin, Italy (most gold medal wins Germany) 2008 XXIX Summer Olympics - Beijing, China (most gold medal wins China) = Basketball = USA basketball teams dominated this era, especially in the Olympics.

Since then a number of high-profile directors have worked for the company, including Ian Wooldridge (1978–84), Ian Brown (1984–88) now at West Yorkshire Playhouse, Alan Lyddiard who left TAG to become artistic director of Northern Stage Ensemble in Newcastle (1988–92), and Tony Graham, now at the Unicorn Theatre in London (1992–97). James Brining was with TAG from 1997 to 2003, before taking up post as artistic director at Dundee Rep Theatre. After a brief period under the direction of Emily Gray (previously associate director at The Unicorn Theatre in London), TAG’s current artistic director is Guy Hollands, who joined the company from his positions as freelance director and Gorbals Drama Worker at the Citizens Theatre, Glasgow. Guy is joint artistic director of the Citizens Theatre, alongside Jeremy Raison.  TAG and the Citizens' Theatre  In 2006 TAG moved back into the Citizens Theatre building in the Gorbals area of Glasgow. TAG is part of the Citizens' Theatre Ltd. and in 2007 completed a full reintegration with the Citizens Theatre itself. 2007 was also the 40th birthday of TAG Theatre Company.

The film involves a couple who befriend a lonely policeman, only for him to develop an unrequited fixation on the wife, leading to chilling consequences. Ray Liotta was nominated for an MTV Movie Award for Best Villain in 1993 for his portrayal of the psychopathic cop. The film was remade in Bollywood as Fareb in 1996.  Plot  Michael and Karen Carr (Kurt Russell and Madeleine Stowe) are a couple living in an upscale part of Los Angeles. Their peace of mind is upset by an intruder coming in through their skylight one night. The intruder briefly takes Karen as a hostage, before dumping her in the swimming pool and making his escape. The Carrs call the police, one of whom, Pete Davis (Ray Liotta), takes extra interest in the couple's case. He cuts through department red tape and expedites speedy installation of a security system in the Carrs' house. When Michael expresses an interest in getting revenge on the intruder, Pete invites him on a ride-along with his partner, Roy Cole (Roger E. Mosley). After dropping Cole off, Pete takes Michael out to arrest the man who broke into the Carrs' house, offering Michael a chance to take some revenge using Pete's nightstick. Michael declines, but Pete administers a vicious beating to the intruder, leaving Michael deeply suspicious of Pete's mental stability. He suggests that Pete get some professional help and, especially, stay far away from him and Karen in the future. Pete takes neither suggestion. Instead, he begins to stalk the couple, particularly Karen, with whom he's obsessed. Pete even appears in the couple's bedroom one night while they are making love, just to \\"check that everything's okay\\". When Michael files a complaint against Pete's unwanted attentions, Pete uses his police connections to destroy Michael's business reputation. Encountering bemused apathy from Pete's superiors in the LAPD, Michael turns to Cole, who orders his partner to cease his obsessing, see a shrink or face suspension. Pete then murders Cole, blaming it on a known criminal. Pete then frames Michael on drug charges by planting a supply of cocaine in the Carrs' house, leaving the way clear for him to move in on Karen. Putting his attorney's finances on the line, Michael gets out on bail and takes matters into his own hands. Back at the Carr house, after finding that Pete has brutally murdered her friend, Karen rejects a now distraught Pete, who, on branding her a tease for leading him on and kissing him, goes berserk and attempts to rape her. Michael returns home and Pete attacks him and Karen. Pete and Michael fight. Outside of their bathroom, Pete is able to hold Michael at gunpoint. Karen then bursts out of the room and attacks him, allowing Michael to gain the upper hand. Michael punches Pete and knocks him down the stairs. After regaining consciousness, Pete taunts Michael one last time, before he is finally shot dead by Michael. Michael and Karen go outside and wait for the police to arrive. Cast Production =Filming= Principal photography began on October 25, 1991. Filming took place in and around Los Angeles, California. The house that was used for the Carr residence in the film is located at 546 Wilcox Ave. The school sequence was filmed at Doris Place Elementary School. The sequence where Michael is in jail was filmed at Lincoln Heights Jail. Production wrapped on February 5, 1992. Release =Box office= The film was released in the U.S. on June 26, 1992, opening at #2 in 1,511 theaters, an average of $6,662 per theater. Grossing $10,067,609 in the opening weekend, it went on to gross $57,138,719 in the domestic market. It was a box-office success, and brought back its $23 million budget. =Critical reception= Unlawful Entry received positive reviews from critics, as it holds a 74% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 34 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert praised director Jonathan Kaplan for giving the film's story a sense of realism with its locations, characters with \\"unrestrained realism\\" from the actors and having \\"undertones of a serious social drama\\" when confronting fears about a delusional police authority. Varietys Todd McCarthy wrote that despite being another film that follows in the mould of Fatal Attraction, he called it \\"a very effective victimization thriller\\", praising both Liotta and Russell's performances and Kaplan's direction of the script into \\"areas of social and class-structure observations\\" when dealing with unhinged police figures in an urban setting. In her review for The New York Times, Janet Maslin was critical of the three main leads lacking depth and substance in the motivations of their characters but gave credit to Liotta for giving \\"complexity\\" to his role, a solid supporting cast and the \\"level-headed\\" direction Kaplan takes with the plot, even as it stretches credibility.

Science The Mars Exploration Rovers have provided vast amounts of information by functioning well beyond NASA's original estimates. * Astrophysicists studying the universe confirmed its age at 13.7 billion years, discovered that it will most likely expand forever without limit, and concluded that only 4% of the universe's contents are ordinary matter (the other 96% being still-mysterious dark matter, dark energy, and dark fluid). * The Mars Exploration Rover (MER) Mission successfully reached the surface of Mars in 2004, and sent detailed data and images of the landscape there back to Earth. Whilst NASA's original mission timeline of 3 months was incorrectly speculated, the mission was tremendously successful overall in the long term, as the MER Mission continued until 2018, lasting nearly 25 times the projected length. * The Human Genome Project was completed. * The National Geographic Society and IBM funded The Genographic Project. * In 2002, Perelman posted the first of a series of eprints to the arXiv, in which he proved the Poincaré conjecture, * On 29 July 2005, the discovery of Eris, a Kuiper Belt object larger than Pluto, was announced.

Technology  = Information technology = This contemporary illustration shows the look personal computers took, which differed from the monitor-over-system unit look that dominated much of the late 20th century. Personal computers also started coming out mainly in black, in contrast to the universal creamy white of much of the late 20th century. As with the 1980s and 1990s, there continued to be smaller system units, including all-in-one computers. * There was a huge jump in broadband internet usage globally - for example, it comprised only 6% of U.S. internet users in June 2000 and one mid-decade study predicted 62% adoption by 2010. Yet, by February 2007, over 80% of US Internet users were connected via broadband and broadband internet became almost a required standard for quality internet browsing. There were 77.4 million broadband subscribers in the US in December 2008, with 264 million broadband subscribers alone in the top 30 countries at that time. * There was a boom in music downloading and the use of data compression to quickly transfer music over the Internet, with a corresponding rise of portable digital audio players, typified by Apple's iPod, along with other MP3 players. Digital music sales rose, accounting for 6% of all music sales in 2005. Digital music options were integrated into other devices such as smartphones and the popular PlayStation Portable (PSP). By the latter half of the decade, generic MP3 players were starting to mimic the features of the extremely popular iPod and Zune. * As a result of the widespread popularity and social impact of Google Search, the word \\"google\\" came to be used as a verb. * Adobe Flash technology reached the point of being able to make video players. As a result, YouTube, a website which allows uploading and viewing videos, was created. YouTube's popularity grew explosively and it was acquired by Google. * Data storage prices continued to drop, going from approximately $7 USD per GB in early 2000 to $0.07 USD per GB in 2009. * Due to an increase in capacity, USB flash drives rapidly replaced Zip disks and floppy discs (by Iomega) and 3.5-inch diskettes. * The first 2 TB hard drives were developed and beginning to be used.History of hard disk drives#Timeline * Windows XP and Microsoft Office 2003 became the ubiquitous industry standard in personal computer software, although their successors Windows Vista and, by the end of the decade, Windows 7, saw increasing market penetration. * Open-source and free software continued to be a notable but minority interest, with versions of the Linux kernel gaining in popularity, as well as the Mozilla Firefox web browser and the OpenOffice.org productivity suite. * Blogs, portals, intranets and wikis became common electronic dissemination methods for professionals, amateurs, and businesses to conduct knowledge management. ** Wikipedia began and grew, becoming both the largest encyclopedia, and the most widely read wiki in the world. * Wireless networks became ever more commonplace in homes, education institutes and urban public spaces. * Peer-to-peer technology was used in a major way, such as internet telephony (Skype), file-sharing. The Internet became a major source of all types of media, from music to movies, thanks initially to file-sharing peer-to-peer programs such as Kazaa and LimeWire. The debate continued over the ethics of file sharing. Legal music download services such as iTunes and streaming services such as Spotify opened up new markets. * The video game industry's profits surpassed the movie industry's in 2004. * The US tech bubble burst for the most part in early 2000s and after three years of negative growth the technology market began its rebound in 2003. * Social networking websites like Myspace and Facebook and microblogging platforms like Twitter gained in popularity. * Smartboards in schools gained acceptance and were adopted rapidly during the middle years of the decade. * E-book readers using electronic paper technology were developed, and enjoyed modest popularity.  Software development  * The Agile Manifesto was launched and agile project management approaches such as Scrum grew in popularity. However, due to factors such as inflexibility in procurement processes, and lack of expertise among civil servants, government computing projects continued to fail with regularity, notably in the United Kingdom. * A large number of software development and software testing jobs in rich nations were offshored to less wealthy countries such as India and Russia, mirroring a globalisation trend that had already occurred in physical manufacturing. This led to a great deal of job creation in the IT sector in countries like India (in parallel with other offshored office jobs such as call centre worker), and the most in-demand Indian software developers found their salaries rose to levels comparable with Western developers, despite the substantially lower costs of living they enjoyed. However, not all employers were happy with the quality of work they saw by outsourcing and offshoring, and some took jobs back in-house, or at least \\"on-shore\\". ** There was also a trend of offshoring software development work to cities like Dubai and Singapore - where Western developers rubbed shoulders with other foreign workers - and \\"offshoring\\" within the EU (including nearshoring). =Video= TiVo typified the growth in DVRs * Digital cameras became very popular due to rapid decreases in size and cost while photo resolution steadily increased. As a result, sales of film reel cameras diminished greatly, and integration into mobile phones increased greatly; sexting by teenagers also became a controversial social issue, with teenagers - and even in one case a school administrator who investigated a sexting case - being arrested. * Graphics processing units (GPUs) and video cards became powerful enough to render ultra-high-resolution (e.g. 2560 × 1600) scenes in real time with substantial detail and texture. * Flat panel displays began displacing cathode ray tubes. This was a dramatic change during the decade, as very few flat panels were sold through the mid-2000s (decade) and the majority of stores sell only flat panel TVs by the end of the decade. * Handheld projectors entered the market and were then integrated into cellphones. * The digital switchover started to be enforced for television. * The introduction of digital video recorders (DVRs) allowed consumers to modify content they watch on TV, and to record TV programs and watch them later, leading to problems as consumers could fast-forward through commercials, making them useless, and save TV shows for later viewing, causing a decline in live TV viewing. However, these problems were already present with video tapes. * Internet usage surpassed TV viewing in 2004. Satellite TV and cable TV (with the exception of digital cable) lost ratings as network television ratings gradually increased. * TV networks started streaming shows online. * There was an increase in usage of online DVD rental services such as Netflix. * DVDs, and subsequently Blu-ray Discs, replaced VCR technology as the common standard in homes and at video stores, although inexpensive VCRs and videocassettes could still be found at some thrift stores and discount stores. =Vehicles and energy= * There were major advances in hybrid vehicles such as the Toyota Prius, Ford Escape, and the Honda Insight. * Many more computers and other technologies were incorporated into vehicles, such as Xenon HID headlights, GPS, DVD players, self-diagnosing systems, advanced pre-collision safety systems, memory systems for car settings, back-up sensors and cameras, in-car media systems, MP3 player compatibility, USB drive compatibility, self- parking systems, keyless start and entry, satellite radio, voice-activation, cellphone connectivity, adaptive headlights, HUD (Head-Up-Display), infrared cameras, and Onstar (on GM models). * There was greater interest in future energy development due to global warming and the potential scenario of peak oil, even though these problems had been known about for decades. Photovoltaics increased in popularity and decreased in cost as a result of increased public interest and generous public subsidies. =Communications= Small, powerful, accessibly priced mobile phones became highly common, and by the end of the decade were expanding quickly in third-world countries. * The popularity of mobile phones and text messaging surged in the 2000s decade in the Western world. The advent of text messaging made possible new forms of interaction that were not possible before, resulting in numerous boons such as the ability to receive information on the move. Nevertheless, it also led to negative social implications such as Text \\"bullying\\" and the rise of traffic collisions caused by drivers who were distracted as they were texting while driving. * Due to the major success of broadband Internet connections, Voice over IP (VoIP) began to gain popularity as a replacement for traditional telephone lines. Major telecommunications carriers began converting their networks from TDM to VoIP. * Unusually for a development heralded by science fiction, videophones were cheap and abundant, yet even by mid-decade, they had not received much attention, perhaps due to the high cost of video calls relative to ordinary calls. * Mobile phones adopted features such as Internet access, PDA functions, running software applications, video calling, cameras and video recording, and music and video playback as standard. Higher end smartphones continue to offer extra features such as GPS and Wireless. * Due to improvements in mobile phone displays and memories, most mobile phone carriers offered video viewing services, internet services, and some offered full music downloads, such as Sprint in 2005 and more common use of Bluetooth. This led to a virtual saturation of cell phone ownership among the public in the developed world, increasing the use of mobile phones as everyday carry items, and a sharp decline in the use and numbers of payphones. =Robotics= * As in previous decades, robotics continued to develop, especially telerobotics in medicine, particularly for surgery. * Home automation and home robotics advanced in North America; iRobot's \\"Roomba\\" was the most successful domestic robot and sold 1.5 million units. (Others of interest include: Robomower, and Scooba as of May 2006) *The first robotic vehicle completed the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005 and became the first vehicle to be able to navigate itself with no external interference. * Humanoid robots and robot kits improved considerably, to the point of retailing as toys. This was typified by RoboSapien and Lego Mindstorms respectively. =Space technology= * GPS (Global Positioning System) became very popular, especially in the tracking of items or people, and the use in cars. Games that utilize the system, such as geocaching, emerged and developed a niche following. * The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster occurred in February 2003. * SpaceShipOne made the first privately funded human spaceflight on June 21, 2004. =Healthcare= * Corrective eye surgery became popular as costs and potential risk decreased and results further improved. * 244 new drugs were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. =General retail= * RFID (Radio Frequency ID) became widely used in retail giants such as Wal-Mart, as a way to track items and automate stocking and keeping track of items. * Self- serve kiosks became very widely available, and were used for all kinds of shopping, airplane boarding passes, hotel check-ins, fast food, banking, and car rental. ATMs became nearly universal in much of the First World and very common even in poorer countries and their rural areas.

C. Byrne & Co. These people landed in Natal on 20 ships during the years 1849 to 1851. Allotments were laid out in the Byrne valley, near Richmond. J.C. Byrne & Co. offered prospective emigrants a passage to Natal and of land at the following rates: L10 for a steerage passage (L15 was the usual fare), and L19 for an intermediate berth. Children under 14 were charged L5 and were entitled to . Cabin passengers could travel for L35, but were not entitled to land (on the ships’ lists they appeared as ‘passengers’, while the others were labelled ‘emigrants’). To take advantage of the land allotment an emigrant had to be approved by Her Majesty's Land and Emigration Commissioners - his/her age had to be 45 maximum unless accompanied by adult offspring, and the only acceptable occupations were the practical ones of farmer, blacksmith, wheelwright, wagon-maker, dairymaid, agricultural labourer, etc. Byrne was fortunate to obtain the surveyor and civil engineer John Swales Moreland as his agent in Natal. Moreland was committed to his task, energetic and loyal, despite the various trials he was called on to bear. The first vessel, the Wanderer, sailed on 24 Jan. 1849 with 15 emigrants. She arrived on 16 May, and was followed in July by the Washington, on which John Moreland was a passenger. Byrne's miscalculations eventually scuttled his scheme. He would have been saved these had he actually visited the Colony. First, he thought there were vast open spaces just waiting to be settled, as a result of the Boers’ withdrawal from Natal once British rule had been established. However, he was out of date. In 1848 Sir Harry Smith, the Cape Governor (Natal was then a district of the Cape), made an attempt to halt the exodus of Boers by relaxing the regulations under which lands were granted. This did not have the desired effect. Instead of returning and occupying the land they were thus able to claim, the Boers more often than not sold it to speculators, sometimes at prices as low as 1d or2d an acre, and withdrew permanently beyond the Drakensberg. Thus the Government had very little left in the way of Crown lands in sufficiently large blocks to allow the settlement of large numbers of emigrants. Then his lot plan was quite unrealistic, taking into account the Natal countryside - there was no way an immigrant could make a living here on . Thus Moreland found it extremely difficult to obtain suitable land, i.e. well-watered, with good soil, access to timber for firewood and building purposes, and within easy distance of either Pietermaritzburg or Durban. Many emigrants rejected their allotments as not worth the payment of survey fees, and either found jobs in the towns, or purchased or leased land at very little cost elsewhere. They were certainly not going to buy Byrne’s land at 5/- an acre. Things went from bad to worse, and eventually in Sep. 1850 Byrne surrendered his estate.

Cervical spinal stenosis is one of the most common forms of spinal stenosis, along with lumbar spinal stenosis (which occurs at the level of the lower back instead of in the neck). Thoracic spinal stenosis, at the level of the mid- back, is much less common. Cervical spinal stenosis can be far more dangerous by compressing the spinal cord. Cervical canal stenosis may lead to serious symptoms such as major body weakness and paralysis. Such severe spinal stenosis symptoms are virtually absent in lumbar stenosis, however, as the spinal cord terminates at the top end of the adult lumbar spine, with only nerve roots (cauda equina) continuing further down. Cervical spinal stenosis is a condition involving narrowing of the spinal canal at the level of the neck. It is frequently due to chronic degeneration, but may also be congenital or traumatic. Treatment frequently is surgical. Diagnosis Treatments =Nonsurgical treatment= Potential nonsurgical treatments include: * Education about the course of the condition and how to relieve symptoms * Medicines to relieve pain and inflammation, such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) * Exercise, to maintain or achieve overall good health, aerobic exercise, strength training muscles that support the neck and spine, core exercises and posture correction. * Weight loss, to relieve symptoms and slow progression of the stenosis * Physical therapy, to provide education, instruction, and support for self-care; physical therapy instructs on stretching and strength exercises that may lead to a decrease in pain and other symptoms * Chiropractic Care * Acupuncture *Anti-inflammation foods. =Surgery= Potential surgical treatments include: * Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion - A surgical treatment of nerve root or spinal cord compression by decompressing the spinal cord and nerve roots of the cervical spine with a discectomy to stabilize the corresponding vertebrae. * Laminoplasty - A surgical procedure to relieve pressure on the spinal cord by cutting the lamina on both sides of the affected vertebrae (cutting through on one side and merely cutting a groove on the other) and then \\"swinging\\" the freed flap of bone open. * Laminectomy - A surgical procedure in which the lamina of the vertebra is removed or trimmed to widen the spinal canal and create more space for the spinal nerves and thecal sac.

Early life Sheila Sherlock was born in Dublin on 31 March 1918, the only daughter of Violet Mary Catherine (née Beckett) and Samuel Philip Sherlock, an army officer then serving as a lieutenant in the 1st Cavalry Reserve. Her family moved from Ireland to London soon after her birth and she attended private schools in the city until her family moved in 1929 to the village of Sandgate, Kent. In Kent, she was educated at the Folkestone County School for Girls. In the early part of the twentieth century female applicants to medical schools were at a great disadvantage, and from 1935 to 1936 Sherlock attempted to enter several English medical schools but was rejected. In 1936 she was accepted for a place to study medicine at University of Edinburgh. Her ability became evident, and she graduated in 1941 finishing top of her year. She was awarded the Ettles Scholarship, being only the second woman to have done so.Obituary, The Guardian, 19 January 2002 Career She remained in Edinburgh to take up the post of Assistant Lecturer in Surgery offered to her by Professor Sir James Learmonth, and published her first paper with Learmonth in 1942. She later recounted that Learmonth had taught her how to conduct and document research. In the same year she was appointed House Physician to Professor Sir John McMichael at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital. In this post she worked on hepatitis, which she was able to continue from 1943 to 1947 with funding from the Medical Research Council and subsequently with the award of the Beit Memorial Fellowship. She was awarded her MD with a thesis on The Liver in Disease: with special reference to aspiration liver biopsy, receiving a Gold Medal from University of Edinburgh.Archives Hub Papers and correspondence of Dame Sheila Sherlock, 1918–2001, hepatologist She conducted research into portal hypertension, hepatic encephalopathy and ascites at this time. In 1947 she spent a year at Yale University's School of Medicine as a Rockefeller Travelling Fellow, working on carbohydrate metabolism and liver disease. She returned to London and in 1948 was appointed Lecturer in Medicine and Consultant Physician at Hammersmith Hospital. In 1951, aged 33, she was elected as a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, making her, at the time, the youngest woman to receive this qualification. In 1959, she became the United Kingdom's first ever female Professor of Medicine when she was appointed at the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine in London. She founded the liver unit which was located in a temporary wooden structure on the roof of the hospital in Gray’s Inn Road. Despite its location, the department attracted trainees from around the world, and many current leaders in the field of hepatology spent time there. Research in several different areas of liver disease was undertaken: including; bilirubin metabolism, haemochromatosis, cholestasis, drug-induced liver disease, albumin synthesis, portal hypertension and ascites, autoimmune liver disease and its treatment with corticosteroids, and the use of liver biopsy in the diagnosis of liver disease were all studied. In 1974 the department moved to the new hospital in Hampstead, where it was situated close to the clinical wards, on the 10th floor. Research continued there, with viral hepatitis, liver transplantation and endoscopic treatment of varices all becoming important areas of study. She retired from the Chair of Medicine in 1983, but continued to see patients, conduct research, and write. =Affiliations= * Co-founder (with Hans Popper) and president, International Association for the Study of the Liver (1958–1962) * Councillor (1964–1968), Censor (1970–72), Senior Censor and Vice President (1976–77) Royal College of Physicians – Sherlock was the first woman Vice President of the Royal College of Physicians * President, British Society of Gastroenterology (1973) * Member of Senate, University of London (1976–77) * Founder, and later President, British Liver Trust (1988–2001) * Founder, American Association for the Study of Liver Disease She delivered several of the Royal College of Physicians lectures including the Bradshaw Lecture (1961), Humphry Davy Rolleston (1968) and Lumleian Lectures (1978) and Harveian Oration (1985). =Publications= Sherlock was known as a clear and succinct writer, and she published over 600 papers in scientific journals.

They had two daughters Amanda and Auriole, and two granddaughters. Although occasionally referred to as Mrs Sheila James she generally preferred to be known by her maiden name, and was one of the first female professionals to follow this pattern. On 30 December 2001, Sherlock died in London from pulmonary fibrosis, two weeks after her golden wedding anniversary. Her daughter Amanda, a Baptist minister, conducted her funeral. Legacy When Sherlock started her medical career, little was known about liver disease. Her work helped to establish hepatology as a medical specialty. She pioneered the use of needle liver biopsy, which had been used purely as a research tool, based on the technique of Sir John McMichael. Her approach improved the understanding of the pathology of liver disease and it continues to be used in the diagnosis of liver diseases today. The liver unit that she set up at the Royal Free Hospital became the centre for both research into liver disease and the education of trainees in the specialty. In 1966, she developed, with Deborah Doniach of the Middlesex Hospital, the standard test for Primary Biliary Cirrhosis and later showed that it was an autoimmune disease. She also demonstrated the efficacy of corticosteroid therapy for autoimmune hepatitis. She also recognised the link between hepatitis B and hepatocellular carcinoma. In 2006, the Sheila Sherlock Prizes were founded with a donation from her husband, Dr Geraint James. The two prizes are awarded to the highest achieving medical students at the UCL Medical School.UCL Student Handbook Online – The Sheila Sherlock Prizes In March 2008, on the 90th anniversary of her birth, the liver unit which she had founded at the Royal Free Hospital, was renamed the Sheila Sherlock Liver Centre in her memory.

In culinary science, degreasing is done with the intention of reducing the fat content of a meal. Degreasing food Degreasing is often used by dieters, particularly those following low-fat diets to reduce their fat consumption to induce weight loss. The energy content of 1 g of fat is 9 calories, while that of carbohydrates and proteins are 4 calories. Hence, dieters often view decreasing fat consumption as an efficient way of losing weight without greatly sacrificing total volume of food. Degreasing during meal preparation is used to reduce the energy content of the food being prepared. Those people who wish to reduce their cholesterol level or fat intake, in particular people with hypercholesterolemia often use degreasing to reduce their fat consumption. = Degreasing of a meal during preparation = Fat trimming of a meal can be done during preparation by a variety of methods. The most common methods involving substituting food items or removal of naturally occurring fat and conservative addition of fat. Substituting fats is a method in which a certain ingredient is substituted by another ingredient. A common way of doing this is substituting saturated fatty acids with unsaturated fatty acids while cooking. For instance, olive oil can be used instead of butter for seasoning vegetables. Food items are also substituted to reduce fat content. For instance, instead of using eggs by using a whole egg, where the egg yolks are high in fat levels, egg whites can instead be used. Alternatively, skimmed milk or similar low-fat products can be used as ingredients for cooking. =Degreasing liquids= (Frozen soup with a layer of fat shown above) Cooling provides an easy way to degrease food as the fat rises to the surface and solidifies fully. Many different foods can be degreased after preparation. Liquid foods that are high in fat, such as braising liquids, roasting juices and broths may have floating oil on top throughout and after the cooking process. Fat can be skimmed off the liquid with a small ladle, spoon, or cup as the liquid simmers and then discarded. This is done by placing the saucepan with only half of it on the heat source so that the liquid simmers only on one side. This pushes the fat to the opposite side and makes it easier to lift off with the ladle. The fat can then be skimmed off by holding the ladle so that the top of its bowl is almost level with the liquid and then tilting it slightly and in a circular motion toward the edge of the saucepan where the fat accumulates. As braising liquids and broths simmer, they typically throw off more fat and protein and sometimes froth, so it is easier to wait at least a few minutes until the liquid has cooled before degreasing. In making slowly reduced liquids it may be ideal to wait for it to cool even longer. As an alternative to a ladle, a degreasing cup can be used to skim the fat off hot liquids. This is a clear plastic or glass cup that looks similar to a teapot, with a spout that comes out of the bottom. The liquid and juices are poured into the cup then poured out leaving the fat behind; the liquid comes from the bottom of the cup instead of the top. Degreasing cups come in various sizes. Refrigerating or freezing liquids until the fat congeals and solidifies can make the fat easier to remove with a spoon. If, after removing the congealed fat, the liquid still appears cloudy, it can be made clearer by skimming it again with a ladle after bringing it to a gentle simmer to allow for the release of more fat and insoluble proteins. =Degreasing solid food items= Some items, such as roasted foods, and other cooked food items, such as pizza, can sometimes be oily and greasy. Degreasing them after preparation may provide a solution to this problem. Fried foods, such as French fries, can often be degreased without decreasing the crispiness of the food item by simply blotting out the oil in the food item with a tissue paper. Commercial degreasing Many food manufacturing companies such as Weight Watchers have been developed for people who wish to reduce their fat intake. The customer need of defatting has also led to the production of low fat products, e.g., low fat cheese. Solvent degreasing Solvent degreasing is a process used to prepare a part for further operations such as electroplating or painting. Typically it uses petroleum, chlorine, or alcohol based solvents to dissolve the machining fluids and other contaminants that might be on the part.Kalpakjian, Serope, Schmid, Steven R. (2006).

Particular areas of interest concerning galactic tides include galactic collisions, the disruption of dwarf or satellite galaxies, and the Milky Way's tidal effect on the Oort cloud of the Solar System. Effects on external galaxies = Galaxy collisions = The lengthy tidal tails of the colliding antennae galaxies Tidal forces are dependent on the gradient of a gravitational field, rather than its strength, and so tidal effects are usually limited to the immediate surroundings of a galaxy. Two large galaxies undergoing collisions or passing nearby each other will be subjected to very large tidal forces, often producing the most visually striking demonstrations of galactic tides in action. Two interacting galaxies will rarely (if ever) collide head-on, and the tidal forces will distort each galaxy along an axis pointing roughly towards and away from its perturber. As the two galaxies briefly orbit each other, these distorted regions, which are pulled away from the main body of each galaxy, will be sheared by the galaxy's differential rotation and flung off into intergalactic space, forming tidal tails. Such tails are typically strongly curved. If a tail appears to be straight, it is probably being viewed edge-on. The stars and gas that comprise the tails will have been pulled from the easily distorted galactic discs (or other extremities) of one or both bodies, rather than the gravitationally bound galactic centres. Two very prominent examples of collisions producing tidal tails are the Mice Galaxies and the Antennae Galaxies. Just as the Moon raises two water tides on opposite sides of the Earth, so a galactic tide produces two arms in its galactic companion. While a large tail is formed if the perturbed galaxy is equal to or less massive than its partner, if it is significantly more massive than the perturbing galaxy, then the trailing arm will be relatively minor, and the leading arm, sometimes called a bridge, will be more prominent. Tidal bridges are typically harder to distinguish than tidal tails: in the first instance, the bridge may be absorbed by the passing galaxy or the resulting merged galaxy, making it visible for a shorter duration than a typical large tail. Secondly, if one of the two galaxies is in the foreground, then the second galaxy — and the bridge between them — may be partially obscured. Together, these effects can make it hard to see where one galaxy ends and the next begins. Tidal loops, where a tail joins with its parent galaxy at both ends, are rarer still. = Satellite interactions = The Andromeda Galaxy. Note its satellite galaxy M32 at the top left, just above the edge of Andromeda's disk, whose outer arms have been stripped away by Andromeda's tidal forces. Because tidal effects are strongest in the immediate vicinity of a galaxy, satellite galaxies are particularly likely to be affected. Such an external force upon a satellite can produce ordered motions within it, leading to large-scale observable effects: the interior structure and motions of a dwarf satellite galaxy may be severely affected by a galactic tide, inducing rotation (as with the tides of the Earth's oceans) or an anomalous mass-to-luminosity ratio. Satellite galaxies can also be subjected to the same tidal stripping that occurs in galactic collisions, where stars and gas are torn from the extremities of a galaxy, possibly to be absorbed by its companion. The dwarf galaxy M32, a satellite galaxy of Andromeda, may have lost its spiral arms to tidal stripping, while a high star formation rate in the remaining core may be the result of tidally-induced motions of the remaining molecular clouds (Because tidal forces can knead and compress the interstellar gas clouds inside galaxies, they induce large amounts of star formation in small satellites.) The stripping mechanism is the same as between two comparable galaxies, although its comparatively weak gravitational field ensures that only the satellite, not the host galaxy, is affected. If the satellite is very small compared to the host, the tidal debris tails produced are likely to be symmetric, and follow a very similar orbit, effectively tracing the satellite's path. However, if the satellite is reasonably large—typically over one ten thousandth the mass of its host—then the satellite's own gravity may affect the tails, breaking the symmetry and accelerating the tails in different directions. The resulting structure is dependent on both the mass and orbit of the satellite, and the mass and structure of the conjectured galactic halo around the host, and may provide a means of probing the dark matter potential of a galaxy such as the Milky Way. Over many orbits of its parent galaxy, or if the orbit passes too close to it, a dwarf satellite may eventually be completely disrupted, to form a tidal stream of stars and gas wrapping around the larger body. It has been suggested that the extended discs of gas and stars around some galaxies, such as Andromeda, may be the result of the complete tidal disruption (and subsequent merger with the parent galaxy) of a dwarf satellite galaxy. Effects on bodies within a galaxy Tidal effects are also present within a galaxy, where their gradients are likely to be steepest. This can have consequences for the formation of stars and planetary systems. Typically a star's gravity will dominate within its own system, with only the passage of other stars substantially affecting dynamics. However, at the outer reaches of the system, the star's gravity is weak and galactic tides may be significant. In the Solar System, the hypothetical Oort cloud, believed to be the source of long-period comets, lies in this transitional region. Diagram of the Oort cloud. The Oort cloud is believed to be a vast shell surrounding the Solar System, possibly over a light-year in radius. Across such a vast distance, the gradient of the Milky Way's gravitational field plays a far more noticeable role. Because of this gradient, galactic tides may then deform an otherwise spherical Oort cloud, stretching the cloud in the direction of the galactic centre and compressing it along the other two axes, just as the Earth distends in response to the gravity of the Moon. The Sun's gravity is sufficiently weak at such a distance that these small galactic perturbations may be enough to dislodge some planetesimals from such distant orbits, sending them towards the Sun and planets by significantly reducing their perihelia. Such a body, being composed of a rock and ice mixture, would become a comet when subjected to the increased solar radiation present in the inner Solar System. It has been suggested that the galactic tide may also contribute to the formation of an Oort cloud, by increasing the perihelia of planetesimals with large aphelia. This shows that the effects of the galactic tide are quite complex, and depend heavily on the behaviour of individual objects within a planetary system.

The Lost River originates outside of the cave and flows into it. The cave contains one of the largest natural entrances in the Eastern U.S. Boat tours are available year-round, but closed for Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and New Year's Day. The river was once listed by Ripley's Believe it or Not as the \\"Shortest, deepest river in the world\\" because the blue hole is over 437 feet deep, while the river itself is only 400 feet long. In fact, the blue hole is only 16 feet deep, but is linked to a further underground river. The 72-acre cave property is jointly owned by Western Kentucky University and the non-profit Friends of Lost River Cave. Geology The cave consists of Chert (known as the Lost River Chert), which is overlaid by the Ste. Genevieve Limestone and St. Louis Limestone, both of which were laid down in the middle to late Mississippian Period. The river appears above ground in three short sections before flowing into the mouth of the cave. The most interesting section is the blue hole, which is the cause of the Lost River being listed by Ripley's Believe it or Not as the \\"Shortest, deepest river in the world.\\" Plumb bobs indicated that the blue hole was 437 feet deep, while the river itself is only 400 feet long. The blue hole is though in fact linked to a further underground river. This caused plumb bobs to be swept underground, returning erroneous measurements. According to Malcolm Field and Guanguan Li: In 1847, Thomas Kite provided the following description of the river and cave in his journal: First inhabitants Archaeologists at Western Kentucky University have uncovered a significant history of human presence dating from the Paleo-Indians at the end of the last ice age 10,000 years ago. The location of the cave and the valley provided area inhabitants with shelter and with safe and plentiful sources of food and water. Ten thousand years ago, the Kentucky climate was cooler and wetter. The landscape supported evergreen forest. The Paleo-Indian Cultural Tradition, also known as \\"big game hunters\\", roamed the forests in search of food and shelter. These humans utilized Clovis spear points to bring down such animals as the giant ground sloth, the woolly mammoth, and the mastodon. The inhabitants were nomadic groups, moving between different camp sites seasonally. Anthropologist Jack Schock of Western Kentucky University believes that these prehistoric Kentucky tribes camped at Lost River Cave in the winter, enjoying shelter from the cave and clean water from the blue hole. Starting around 8,000 B.C., during the Archaic period in North America, the inhabitants began exploiting the environment in a more organized fashion. One of the only Dalton points found in situ in southeastern Kentucky was discovered at Lost River by Dr. Schock. This spear point, dated at around 8,000 years old, is a rare find, making Lost River an important archaeological site for studying the Archaic period. These native groups occupied the Cave region until around 1,000 B.C. Mill The proximity of the cave to Bowling Green and the Louisville-Nashville Turnpike allowed it to contribute to the 19th century commercial and agricultural development of Warren County. There are many conflicting reports on the construction of the first water mill at Lost River Cave. Some undocumented 20th century reports state that it was built in 1792 (the year Bowling Green was founded) as a corn gristmill and saw mill. Other accounts place the construction of the \\"first flour mill in Warren County\\" much later. Throughout the 19th century, the site hosted several mills with different operators and production goals. The first of these structures sat inside the cave; however, later millers built their operations on top of the arched entrance to the cavern. According to W. F. Smith, who bought the cave in 1917, Shank's Mill was the only underground water mill in the U.S. By 1825, the mill was under the ownership of James Skiles. In 1847, a Mr. ShanksWho? owned the mill. In addition to producing grist, he installed a wool carding machine. This mill was built directly in the stream under the rock arch of the cave entrance. In the mid-1870s, John L. Row built a stone dam in the stream near the cave entrance, drilled through 42 feet of bedrock in the arched ceiling of the cave entrance, and constructed a three-story high mill above the cave. A shaft ran to an undershot wheel in the dam raceway. He operated his mill as a distillery and flour mill until 1889 when it was purchased by James Skaggs. The last mill at Lost River, owned by Robert Crump, was destroyed by fire in 1915. A history of industry which lasted over a century ended with the burning of the old mill. Today, the hole John Row drilled in the cave ceiling, a reconstructed dam from the nightclub era and a large waterwheel at the entrance to the park are used by interpreters to explain the importance of economic and industrial development for early owners of the cave and valley. Civil War During the Civil War, the cave and valley were under the control of both sides at different times. Confederate forces occupied Bowling Green from September 18, 1861 to February 14, 1862. The area was then taken over by Union soldiers and used as a camp. John Hunt Morgan allegedly hid in the cave when escaping from pursuing troops after burning the train depot at Shakertown, South Union, Kentucky. However, this story holds little credibility, since Union soldiers were camped there. During the period of Union control, nearly 40,000 soldiers camped in the vicinity of the cave. Later explorers have found places where soldiers wrote their names, ranks and companies on the ceilings and walls of the cave. Archaeologists have also found Union bullets within the cave chamber. Cavern Nite Club era Like many caves, Lost River was rumored to have been used for manufacturing alcohol during the Prohibition, although this has not been proven. With the repeal of Prohibition, however, the cave obtained a new use. In 1934, local businessman Jimmy Stewart opened a nightclub in the mouth of the cave, complete with stage, bar and dance floor. Known as the \\"Cavern Nite Club,\\" the venue was popular because of its cool temperatures during a time when air conditioning was relatively rare. Famous performers included Dinah Shore, Francis Craig, and the NBC Orchestra. In 1939, Billboard Magazine named the Cavern Nite Club as the only air-conditioned nightclub in the U.S. Electricity was generated by the water wheel, using a 15-kilowatt alternator manufactured by the Ideal Manufacturing Company of Mansfield, Ohio. The Cavern Nite Club was made accessible to tourists by the construction of the Dixie Highway (now U.S. 31-W) on the right-of-way of the 19th-Century Louisville-Nashville Turnpike. The nightclub and cave tours were enhanced by a local legend that the famous outlaw Jesse James hid out in the cave depths to escape the law after robbing the Southern Deposit Bank in Russellville, Kentucky. Decline, use as a dump site, and founding of nonprofit The nightclub era ended in the late 1950s and early 1960s. FM radio and television brought about a decline in nightclubs nationwide. Meanwhile, the construction of I-65 re-routed traffic away from Dixie Highway and Lost River Cave. The cool, natural breeze in the cave entrance was less enticing to a generation that had air conditioning in their homes. In 1962, the Cavern Nite Club closed its doors and Lost River Cave entered a time of neglect and abuse. By the 1980s, Lost River Cave had become a dumping site. In 1990, the Friends of Lost River was formed as a non- profit organization with 501(c)3 status in an effort to return the site to its former glory. The Lost River valley and cave site is now owned jointly by Western Kentucky University and the non-profit Friends of Lost River. The cave reopened to the public in 1997, and most traces of abuse have been wiped away. Programs are in the works to remove invasive pest plants from the valley and upland trails and to construct a wetlands area to improve filtration of storm water entering the cave system. Cave boat tour and activities The two-part tour is 45 minutes long. The first part consists of a guided walking tour along the river, the blue hole, and the cave entrance. This offers an opportunity to learn about both the natural and human history of the region. The second part of the tour is conducted on the boat, and allows visitors to explore the inside of the cave. Lost River Cave contains two event venues. The Historic Lost River Cave Ballroom is located in the cave, on the site of the Cavern Nite Club. The River Birch Meeting Room, located adjacent to the visitor center, and contains its own restrooms, a kitchen, and a big screen TV. Both venues are available for event rentals. The park includes approximately two miles of nature trails, which are admission-free. The trails are part of the Bowling Green-Warren County Greenways program. Other activities include a seasonal butterfly habitat, gem mining, geocaching, bird watching, and bird bingo. Binoculars can be checked out in the visitor's center. The park includes a Young Interpreters program, an outdoor classroom, and children's activities.

It is the highest of the group of hills north of Whinlatter Pass in the North Western Fells. The slopes of Lord's Seat are extensively forested. Topography The North Western Fells occupy the area between the rivers Derwent and Cocker, a broadly oval swathe of hilly country, elongated on a north-south axis. Two roads cross from east to west, dividing the fells into three convenient groups. Lord's Seat is the hub of the most northerly sector, rising between Whinlatter Pass and the Vale of Embleton. The principal feature of these fells is a ridge running from the Vale of Lorton in the west to Bassenthwaite Lake in the east. Travelling in this direction the main tops are Graystones, Broom Fell, Lord's Seat and Barf. Barf is in truth a satellite of Lord's Seat but was given the status of a separate fell by Alfred Wainwright in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland FellsAlfred Wainwright: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells, Book 6, The North Western Fells: Westmorland Gazette (1964): Lord's Seat is the focal point of the group and sends out a number of additional ridges. To the south east is Ullister Hill (1,722 ft), a bare mound surrounded by conifer plantations. Further on in the same direction is Seat How (1,627 ft), a rocky top standing above the steep descent to Comb Beck and the Whinlatter Pass road. A second branch of the ridge curves around south and then west from Ullister Hill, terminating in Whinlatter fell. Between Whinlatter and the main east-west ridge is the quiet valley of Aiken Beck. North eastward from Lord's Seat, branching off from the ridge connection to Barf, is a long and sometimes imperceptible watershed which runs up the shore of Bassenthwaite. This divides the catchments of Wythop Beck (flowing north west) and Beck Wythop, a short stream running directly east into the lake. Some way to the north, this line of higher ground ends at Sale Fell. Lord's Seat gives birth to a number of streams which, although departing in different directions, all ultimately join the River Derwent. Aiken Beck and its many tributaries drain the south western flanks, most of which are clad in conifers. Hagg Beck, the main feeder of Beck Wythop, begins a little to the north of the summit. This runs across open fellside at first, only entering the trees at around the 1,100 ft contour. Beckstones Gill flows to Bassenthwaite to the south of Barf, while an unnamed stream does the same to the north. All of the eastern flanks of the range are forested, except for the scree-ridden face of Barf between these two watercourses. Geology The predominant surface rocks are the Kirk Stile Formation, composed of laminated mudstone and siltstone. Much of the summit is overlain with peat and there is a fault to the south west, beyond which are greywacke sandstone turbidities of the Loweswater Formation.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) There is evidence of historic mining activity on the eastern slopes, particularly below Seat How. Four mines operated in this area:- Ladstock, Rachel Wood, Thornthwaite and Beckstones. Most were abandoned in the 1870s but Thornthwaite and Rachel Wood operated until December 1920. The main yields were lead and zinc ores, in particular galena, blende, cerussite and gossan.Adams, John: Mines of the Lake District Fells: Dalesman (1995) Summit The top of Lord's Seat is a smooth grassy dome, the summit being marked by the meeting point of ruined fences and a small cairn. The view is extensive, befitting the highest point north of Whinlatter. The Northern Fells are well displayed over Bassenthwaite and there is also a good view of the Helvellyn range. Grasmoor and its supporters restrict the southward panorama, but there is no such obstruction to the north, the Scottish Hills being visible across the Solway Firth. Ascents From the western side of Whinlatter Pass a pleasant approach can be made up the wooded Aiken Valley, a quiet dale with no vehicular access. The summit of the pass also provides access, either direct via Ullister Hill, or by first climbing Whinlatter and then following the ridge. From the main road along the shore of Bassenthwaite a path can be followed beside Beckstones Gill, climbing just inside the forest. This is an easier alternative to the rough face of Barf.Bill Birkett: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): References Category:Fells of the Lake District Category:Marilyns of England ","title":"Lord's Seat"},{"id":"9422529","text":"Roger E.

WEPF competes for authority and membership with the World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA), which produces its own tournaments and slightly different rules under the game name blackball. Overview The WEPF is the governing body of the sport of eightball pool, which is mostly competed across continental Europe and the Commonwealth. It was established in 1992 by founding member countries Australia, England, and New Zealand. The governing body runs its own world championships, separate from those held by the WPA. Each country under the WEPF has their own referee and umpire body and each country has their own qualification structure in place for grading referees. For instance, South Africa has three basic certificates - League Referee, Provincial Referee and National Referee. Australia is also most complimented on their good governance and structure of their referee/umpire body. The rules of the game are available on the WEPF website with calling procedures and guidance.

Gold, The Practice of Modernism: Modern Architects and Urban Transformation, 1954–1972, Routledge, 2007, 173. Phase 1 was completed between 1963 and 1967, and the centre was opened by Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon in May 1967. It was expanded in 2007 by the addition of the Antonine Centre, a shopping centre that is linked to the older structure by walkways and lifts. The facility has been subject to harsh criticism over the years. It was voted \\"Britain's most hated building\\" in 2005, in a poll organised by Channel 4's programme Demolition, and was twice named Scotland's worst town centre by the Carbuncle Awards.Cumbernauld, BBC News, 25 May 2012.

Construction of its town centre began under contractors Duncan Logan, chief architect Leslie Hugh Wilson and architect Geoffrey Copcutt (until 1962 and 1963), and later Dudley Roberts Leaker, Philip Aitken and Neil Dadge. Phase 1 lasted from 1963 to 1967. The idea was to create a megastructure, in the brutalist style, to accommodate a town of 50,000–80,000 people, although architecture historian John R. Gold notes that the term megastructure was first coined in 1964.Gold 2007, 172.

It stands between Blencathra and Bowscale Fell in the Northern Fells. Topography Bannerdale Crags is a ridge running north west to south east. The name was originally applied purely to the steep north eastern flank, but is now generally given to the fell as a whole.Wainwright, Alfred: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells,Book 5 The Northern Fells: A broad convex slope descends northward from Blencathra's Atkinson Pike top, gradually resolving into two ridges. The western arm continues to Mungrisdale Common while the north eastern limb, flecked with outcropping rock, falls to a steep sided col at . From the depression Blackhazel Beck descends north west to join the River Caldew while the source of the Glenderamackin lies on the opposite slope. Across the col smooth slopes rise once more up the south western flank of the Bannerdale Crags ridge. There is little clue here to the wall of crags on the other side. The north eastern side of the ridge looks down upon the valley of Bannerdale Beck, a tributary of the Glenderamackin. The crags on this side are almost continuous for a mile in length, the highest sections falling to the valley. The major breach is a spur protruding from the face almost below the summit, providing a fine route of ascent.(see below) To the north the summit ridge continues across a broad grassy saddle to Bowscale Fell, the crags continuing a little way into the territory of the neighbouring fell. By contrast to the south east the fell ends in White Horse Bent, the abrupt ridge-end descent to the Glenderamackin. This river has one of the most convoluted passages in the district, passing around the south and east of Bannerdale Crags, before turning back on itself to surround Souther Fell on almost all sides and finally head west for Keswick and the River Derwent. sketch map of Bannerdale Crags Summit The summit of the fell is smooth and grassy, the highest point being set back from the crags and marked by a small cairn of flat stones. Nearer the face is another cairn, referred to on older large scale maps as a currick – a stone shelter built by shepherds.Birkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Harper Collins (1994): The view is surprisingly extensive, the Coniston Fells being in sight to the south, away. The Eastern and Far Eastern Fells are also in view, but the highlight is probably Sharp Edge and the eastern prospect of Blencathra. Geology In common with much of the Northern Fells the Kirk Stile Formation of the Skiddaw Group predominates. This is composed of laminated mudstone and siltstone with greywacke sandstone and is of Ordovician age.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) Bannerdale lead mine was operated at the base of the crag itself, primarily in the latter half of the nineteenth century. This raised galena and blende from an east- west vein system with two major levels being over 100 ft long. Further workings below the summit were known as the graphite level. It is not known how much was found, but the level has only been driven a few feet.Adams, John: Mines of the Lake District Fells: Dalesman (1995) Saddleback Old Mine lies to the south of the fell, near to the col connecting it with Blencathra. This was also driven for lead, but the vein proved to consist mainly of limonite. An attempt was made to market this as a pigment, but commercial success was elusive and there are no records of operation after 1894. Ascents Starting from Mungrisdale village to the east the Glenderamackin can be followed as far as its confluence with Bannerdale Beck. From here the east spur climbs almost direct to the summit, the rock scenery improving throughout and ending with a gentle scramble. An alternative from Mungrisdale is the wide and easy track leading up to the ridge between Bannerdale Crags and Bowscale Fell. Less direct is the climb from Scales, first crossing Mousthwaite Combe to reach the Glenderamackin to the south of the fell. From here a straightforward assault on White Horse Bent is one alternative, or the miners track can be followed to Saddleback Old Mine and the source of the river.

The band was founded in 1930, and toured extensively as a professional organisation before and after the Second World War, with several members performing during the war for the Entertainments National Service Association. It is now an amateur band under the leadership of pipe major Sheila Hatcher. History The band was formed in 1930 by Revd Joseph Waddington Graves, the minister of Osborne Hall Congregational church. He chose 12 girls from the Sunday school with an average age 11, and they had their first practice on 4 October under the direction of Pipe Major Douglas Scott-Taylor. The girls were initially taught in secret, as Taylor thought teaching women would damage his reputation. The band's first performance was 18 months later, to an audience of journalists, who filmed the event. The band wore the Royal Stewart tartan. By 1933 some of the girls had reached the school leaving age of 14 and Graves decided to make the band a professional organisation, with the girls as paid employees and himself as manager. The band was a success and by 1937 was fulfilling 400 engagements a year, sometimes with multiple bands on tour at the same time. Edith Turnbull and Peggy Iris were made pipe majors of the band. The Girl Pipers toured to pre-war Germany, and at one performance Hitler was heard to remark: \\"I wish I had a band like that.\\" The band was touring in the Black Forest in August 1939 when Graves became aware of the rising military tension, and the band curtailed their tour and returned to Britain, two weeks before World War II broke out. The group disbanded at the outbreak of World War II, but 10 girls were allowed to work full-time for the Entertainments National Service Association and others worked part-time. Peggy Iris and Margaret Fraser joined a concert party entertaining troops in Africa, giving over 1000 shows in three years, and were awarded the Africa Star. After the war the band reformed as a professional organisation. David Land, who ran a theatrical agency in Dagenham, took over from Graves in 1948. The Girl Pipers became an amateur band in 1968 as it was uneconomical to continue as a professional group. The band still performs today, with around 15 active members under the leadership of Sheila Hatcher, who has been a member since 1958. Historic records of the Dagenham Girl Pipers are held by the Barking and Dagenham Archive Service at Valence House Museum including photographs and papers of individual members. In popular culture In an essay by Douglas Adams published in The Salmon of Doubt, Adams described the Dagenham Girl Pipers as his \\"dream lover\\", writing \\"With all due respect and love to my dear wife, there are some things that, however loving or tender your wife may be, only a large pipe band can give you.\\". In series 3, episode 9 of Bless this House, the Dagenham Girl Pipers are toasted by Sid James during a scene where Sid and Jean visit France. The Dagenham girl pipers were often referred to by Eric Morecambe during episodes of The Morecambe and Wise Show.

Bowscale Fell is a hill in the English Lake District. It rises above the village of Mungrisdale in the Northern Fells. Bowscale Fell stands at the extreme north east the Blencathra group, connected to this higher fell by the intervening Bannerdale Crags. In common with many fells the western slopes are smooth and convex while the eastern side exhibits crags. Topography A curving ridge surrounds the head of Bannerdale, with Bowscale Fell at the northern end and Bannerdale Crags to the south. The ridgeline is broad and grassy with occasional patches of bog and a couple of small tarns in the north. Bannerdale flows due east from the depression between the two fells to its junction with the River Glenderamackin. A second tributary of the Glenderamackin, Bullfell Beck, runs parallel a little to the north, its source being directly beneath the summit of Bowscale Fell. The heads of the two valleys are divided by a truncated east ridge, The Tongue, which sports a top (1,814 ft) at the far end. From below, The Tongue appears as an impressive pyramidal peak with steep slopes on all sides, obscuring the higher ground behind. A second, longer eastern ridge runs out to the north of Bowscale Fell, forming the northern wall of Bullfell Beck. This has two subsidiary tops at 2,017 ft and 1,981 ft and ends steeply at Raven Crag above the Mungrisdale to Heskett Newmarket road. Perched in a bowl scooped out on the northern face of this ridge is Bowscale Tarn. This is a classic corrie tarn, held in by a whalebacked moraine and having a depth of around 60 ft.Blair, Don: Exploring Lakeland Tarns: Lakeland Manor Press (2003): Bowscale Tarn was a popular tourist attraction in Victorian times, visitors being brought by pony to observe its wild and moody setting.Wainwright, Alfred: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells,Book 5 The Northern Fells: Tastes change and the tarn now finds itself on few itineraries for a grand tour of the District. Legend had it that the tarn was home to two immortal fish, one version of the tale also crediting them with the gift of speech. Above the water is Tarn Crag, the steepest face on the fell. The western and northern flanks of the fell drain to the River Caldew, which heads north east to Carlisle for a meeting with the River Eden, and thence to the Solway Firth. Northward across the deep cutting of the Caldew is Carrock Fell, while to the west are Great Calva and Knott. Wainwright remarked that the western slopes of Bowscale Fell are drained by the Caldew which ultimately flows to the east, while the eastern slopes feed the Glenderamackin which soon turns west for Keswick and the River Derwent. Being on the Derwent - Eden watershed, Bowscale Fell has further topographical significance by providing the link between the Northern and Eastern Fells. The eastern ridge continues almost imperceptibly beneath Raven Crag, crossing the road before rising again to form Little Eycott and Eycott Hills. From here the watershed runs south across Great Mell Fell and ultimately climbs onto Great Dodd in the Helvellyn range. Summit The summit of the fell bears a rash of stones although all else is grass. There is a windshelter at the highest point and a cairn a little to the north, marking the direction of Bowscale Tarn.Birkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): The view of Blencathra and Sharp Edge is excellent, together with a surprising vista of the North Western Fells through the Glenderaterra gap. Ascents A number of alternatives are available when starting from Mungrisdale. The easiest follows a gently rising track to the depression at the head of Bannerdale, while a variation is to turn off and climb steeply up the terminal slope of The Tongue. Bullfell Beck can also be followed to give the most direct ascent to the summit, but the best route is perhaps to follow the east ridge over its undulating tops. From Bowscale, a little along the road to the north, the Victorian pony route to Bowscale Tarn can still be followed, continuing up a grassy rake that bisects Tarn Crag. If a much longer walk is required, the ridge between Bowscale Fell and Bannerdale Crags can be reached from the Caldew Valley to the west. This makes Mosedale, or even Skiddaw House and points west into possible starting points.

History The Agricultural Experiment Station at the University of Illinois (U of I) was formed in 1888, one year after the Hatch Act provided federal funds. After its initial establishment U of I's College of Agriculture began to grow and it was divided into three distinct components: classroom instruction at U of I, the Agricultural Experiment Station, and a statewide extension service. In 1899 Eugene Davenport replaced George E. Morrow as Dean of the College of Agriculture, and Davenport immediately reorganized the college into four departments: agronomy, animal husbandry, dairy husbandry, and horticulture. The Experiment Station was originally established to \\"administer research activities within the College.\\" The Department of Dairy Husbandry, seeking to increase milk productivity by promoting efficiency, prompted the Experiment Station to construct the Experimental Dairy Farm at an area known as South Farms. The layout and design incorporated three round barns. Experimental Dairy Farms, in general, were receiving broad support as a way to combat problems within dairy farming. scale drawing of one the historic district's round barns. The three round barns in the historic district were the inspiration of Wilbur J. Fraser. Fraser was the first head of the Department of Dairy Husbandry from 1902 - 1913. He was also a strong advocate of the round barn which he said offered the \\"economy of consideration, low maintenance, and labor efficiency.\\" Fraser asserted that round barns had a better ability to withstand Midwest windstorms as well.Campus Landmarks, The Round Dairy Barns, University of Illinois. Retrieved 10 February 2007. Fraser became the first Chief of Dairy Husbandry at the Agricultural Experiment Station in 1908. His colleague, H.C. Crouch, left New England at the same time to accept the position of manager at the U of I Experimental Dairy Farm. Fraser spent the summer of 1908 in Europe, visiting the Great Britain, the Netherlands and Denmark. While there, he took opportunity to learn techniques from local farmers which inspired his push for \\"efficiency\\" upon his return to the States. Fraser and Crouch led the promotion of round barn design in Illinois because they believed the very design of the round barn promoted the scientific principles of agriculture as well as a common sense approach to dairy farming. One barn was erected in 1907-08, a second in 1910 or 1912, and the third c. 1912 or 1913, sources vary as to exact dates.Round Barns, U of I: A History of Campus, University of Illinois.

The barns at the University of Illinois were instrumental in round barn era. In Illinois, at least one round barn was built with direct inspiration from the U of I round barns. The facilities at the University of Illinois Experimental Dairy Farm were replaced by larger confines in 1960, though the area was maintained. When the district was nominated for inclusion on the National Register in 1994 the round barns at the site were still being used for small herd dairy experiments and housed cattle. Boundaries The area that encompasses the district is set upon a ridge top and has been popularly known as South Farms. On the north the area is bordered by St. Mary's Road, a fence to the south and west and a treeline on the east side. The area to the north of the district buildings is pasture dotted with a few a university buildings. Open land is found to the east of the district. A variety of plant life surrounds the site as well. The district area is known as South Farms because of its historic location to the south of the main University of Illinois campus along a ridgeline in southern Urbana, Illinois. Architecture the round barns at sunset Many of the smaller outbuildings included in the historic district have no particular architectural style. The main structures in the district, the three round barns and the Manager's House, however, all have distinct architectural design elements from classifications within their unique structure types. The Manager's House combines elements from Tudor Revival and American Craftsman architecture. While the barns are not of a style, per se, they do represent a design movement within American agriculture. The movement that popularized round barns was in part, due to the promotion of the design by the university and its round barns. Structures While the property information report from the state of Illinois asserts that there are eight contributing structures, the actual original nomination form lists eight total structures with only five contributing: a storage building, the three round barns, and the Manager's House. Three other structures detailed on the nomination are listed as non-contributing: the \\"Cow Shed,\\" the Dairy Laboratory, and the 1950s era garage for the Manager's House. Over time, the historic district has lost three structures. One, a silo southwest of Barn #3, was extant as late as 1950. A second was a small, gable-roofed structure which resembled a shed or similar outbuilding. That structure was east of Barn #3. The final lost building was between Barns #2 and #3, along an east-west orientation. Historic photographs show the building was a small, residential structure with human- scaled doorways, which may have been a laboratory of some sort. =Manager's House= This 1908 residential building combines elements from Tudor Revival and American Craftsman architectural styles. The square plan, two-story structure has a full basement and a brick and stucco foundation. =Round Barns= Contributing property round barn#3 and non-contributing white cow shed. The round barns at the University of Illinois played a special role in the promotion and popularity of the American round barn. The University of Illinois was home to one of the Agricultural Experiment Stations at U.S. universities which were at the heart of the promotion of the round barn. At least one round barn in Illinois was built specifically after its owner viewed the barns at the university. Though originally an experiment the three barns helped to lead the way for round barn construction throughout the Midwest, particularly in Illinois. =Storage building= The pre-1934 Storage building is a rectangular, one story structure on a concrete foundation. It has a gabled roof and wood siding, when the district was nominated in 1994 the storage building's gabled roof had asbestos shingles. The interior of the building is open, its walls and ceilings are plywood and it has a concrete floor. =Non-contributing= Of the eight structures on site as of 2007, three are non-contributing to the historical integrity of the small historic district. Two are one-story rectangular buildings: the 1951 Garage and the post-1950 Cow Shed. The third is the 1956 Dairy Laboratory, a one-story \\"L\\" plan building. Significance The University of Illinois Experimental Dairy Farm was established as a National Register of Historic Places historic district on February 4, 1994. The nomination form to the National Register of Historic Places was dated December 22, 1993 and completed by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency (IHPA). The IHPA noted the district's significance under the National Register inclusion criteria for architecture and \\"significant people.\\" The round barns were built to promote the scientific pursuit of dairy farming; they had an impact, in some cases prompting farmers to construct their own round barns.

History The abbey was founded here near the River Diemel in 997 by the nobles Eckehard and Mathilde. It received great privileges from Emperor Otto III and was an Imperial abbey (reichsunmittelbar). It flourished particularly in the 12th century, but its geographical position exposed it to the repeated efforts of the Bishoprics of Paderborn, Cologne and Mainz to extend their territories and spheres of influence. The monastery was dissolved during the Reformation. Scriptorium and goldsmith's workshop The abbey is of particular significance as the home of an especially skilled scriptorium and goldsmith's workshop, producing illuminated books and manuscripts, liturgical and ornamental pieces in gold for church use, and jewellery. This was set up by Roger of Helmarshausen, a highly skilled goldsmith and artist-monk, who moved to Helmarshausen from Stavelot Abbey in 1107. He is sometimes considered to be the author of the medieval treatise on art and crafts, De Diversis Artibus. The scriptorium at Helmarshausen Abbey also produced the Gospels of Henry the Lion, an illuminated manuscript of the four gospels (or gospel book) written between about 1176 and 1188 by the monk Herimann (mentioned by name in the dedication), commissioned by Duke Henry the Lion for Brunswick Cathedral. The volume was sold at auction on 6 December 1983 at Sotheby's in London for £8,140,000, which made it the most expensive book in the world until the sale of the Codex Hammer in 1994.

Its pointed second top is instantly recognisable, standing at the eastern end of the Skiddaw massif. The fell is easily climbed from Keswick or from Skiddaw House to the north. Although now primarily a sheep pasture, it once saw considerable mining activity beneath the long eastern wall of crag. Topography The long south east ridge of Skiddaw descends over Little Man and Jenkin Hill to the depression of Flag Pots. Beyond this is the final upthrust of Lonscale Fell before the craggy descent to the Glenderaterra Beck, The southern flanks fall gently over acres of sheep pasture in the manner of the Skiddaw range. At the base of the slope is the wooded valley of Whit Beck, separating Lonscale Fell from the east ridge of Latrigg. Here also is Lonscale, the farm which has given its name to the fell. Whit Beck is a tributary of the Glenderaterra, a stream which forms the eastern boundary of Lonscale Fell. This flows due south from Skiddaw Forest between the Skiddaw massif and Blencathra, before joining the River Greta and running on through Keswick. The eastern face of the fell above the Glenderaterra is a mile long scarp of crags, a singular feature in the Skiddaw range. To the north of the fell is Skiddaw Forest. Confusingly this forest contains no trees, --other than the windbreak of Skiddaw House -- but is a marshy upland area at around 1,300 ft surrounded on all sides by higher fells. Three streams flow from Skiddaw Forest, dividing the Northern Fells into three sectors. Dash Beck runs north west, the River Caldew north east and the River Glenderaterra south. The single building in Skiddaw Forest is Skiddaw House, which has variously seen service as a shepherds' bothy and a Youth Hostel. The northern boundary of Lonscale Fell is Salehow Beck, a tributary of the River Caldew, its waters bound for the Solway Firth by way of Carlisle. Beyond the river is Great Calva, the first of the Back o'Skiddaw fells. The feeders of Salehow Beck and Whit Beck flow from the col of Flag Pots, completing the western boundary. Geology In common with much of the Northern Fells the Kirk Stile Formation of the Skiddaw Group predominates. This is composed of laminated mudstone and siltstone with greywacke sandstone and is of Ordovician age.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) The Glenderaterra valley was the scene of some mining activity in the nineteenth century. The northern workings were first named Glenderaterra Mine and later Brundholme Mine. These were driven primarily for lead, but also copper ore and baryte. The returns were never economic, the mine being abandoned in 1920. A little to the south was Blencathra Mine, worked unsuccessfully until about 1880.Adams, John: Mines of the Lake District Fells: Dalesman (1995) There are also some abandoned quarries below the eastern crags. Summit The highest point lies on a gentle dome on the western side of the fell. The prominent peaked top visible from below lies to the east at a height of 2,306 ft. This is referred to as Lonscale Pike by some guidebooks.Birkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Collins Willow (1994): The watershed between the Greta to the south and the Caldew to the north actually bypasses both of these tops, following the north eastern ridge of Burnt Horse over a top at 2,295 ft and then onward to Mungrisdale Common, an outlier of Blencathra. The highest point bears a small cairn from which a fine Lakeland panorama is displayed southward. Thirlmere and Derwentwater are seen along with all of the major fell groupings. To the other points of the compass the northern fells intervene, close up but less inspiring.Wainwright, Alfred: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells,Book 5 The Northern Fells: View showing the crags below the summit and the former mine workings in the Glenderaterra valley . Ascents From Keswick, or as a labour saving alternative from the Gale Road car park behind Latrigg, a number of routes present themselves. Flag Pots can be reached from the tourist route to Skiddaw, or a direct line can be taken up the southern slopes. Another possibility is to follow the southern edge of Lonscale Crags, and the final (and longest) option is to contour right around the fell up the Glenderaterra and outflank it from behind. From the Glenderaterra, or from Skiddaw House, the climber can make use of either the Burnt Horse Ridge, or a direct scramble up the buttress to reach Lonscale Pike.

He succeeded his father and grandfather as Member of Parliament for County Dublin in 1863, a seat he held until 1885.

His speeches were cast in a practical mould, and they never disclosed anything like a rancorous spirit. In social life he was deservedly esteemed by all classes.

Vacancy The seat had become vacant when the constituency's Conservative Member of Parliament (MP), Cyril Atkinson, had resigned from the House of Commons on being appointed a High Court judge. He had held the seat since the 1924 general election, when he had defeated the one-term Liberal MP Robert Alstead. Electoral history Atkinson had been returned unopposed at the 1931 general election, when the local Liberals decided not to field a candidate as both parties were supporting the National Government. Prior to that, Altrincham had regularly changed hands between the Conservatives and the Liberals. The contests were close apart from those occasions when a Labour candidate stood, resulting in the Conservatives winning easily, such as at the last contested election in 1929; Altrincham was a constituency with an electorate that was growing quickly; between 1929 and 1931, over 6,000 additional people had been added to the register and in the two years since 1931 a further 2,000 had been added.  Candidates  *The Conservative Party fielded Sir Edward Grigg, the former Liberal MP for Oldham. After distinguished service in the Great War, he had been private secretary to Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George from 1920–22, and had later been Governor of Kenya from 1925 to 1930. *The Liberals did not choose 60-year-old former MP and four time candidate Robert Alstead. Instead the Liberal Party imported the radical Manchester Liberal, Philip Oliver, who had been MP for Manchester Blackley from 1923–1924 and from 1929–1931. *The Labour Party also imported a candidate, as was usually the case, fielding James Hudson, who had been MP for Huddersfield from 1923 to 1931. This meant that all three candidates were former MPs seeking re-election. Campaign An issue to feature in the campaign was the National Government's decision in April to order a British Trade Embargo on the Soviet Union. When the Soviet government placed a number of British engineers on trial for sabotage, the British government protested the arrests and retaliated with an embargo on trade between the two countries. (The engineers were subsequently found guilty, but the Soviet government permitted them to return to Britain.) At the same time the National Government signed a new trade agreement with Nazi Germany.http://www.indiana.edu/~league/1933.htm The Russian embargo had interfered with the business of some Altrincham engineering firms who had contracts with the Soviet Government. This issue was uncomfortably handled by the Conservative candidate Sir Edward Grigg who was accused by the Liberal campaign of shifting his ground on the issue in an attempt to avoid losing votes.The Times, 9 June 1933 This issue helped to re-inforce the difference between the Liberal Party and the Conservative dominated National Government. The Liberal Party supported Free trade and their leaders had resigned from the government at the end of 1932 over the government's decision to introduce trade tariffs. However, the party remained on the government benches. This made it difficult for the Liberal campaign in Altrincham to take full advantage of public discontent with the government.  Results  Grigg held the seat for the Conservatives with a comfortable majority of 9,500 votes over Oliver. Philip Oliver *Percentage change and swing are calculated from 1929. Aftermath Grigg held the seat until its abolition for the 1945 general election, when he was ennobled as Baron Altrincham. In 1935 Oliver returned to contest Manchester Blackley without success. Hudson was defeated again at Stockport in 1935, but returned to the House of Commons in 1945 as MP for Ealing West. The National Government ended the Russian Trade embargo on 1 July 1933.

Map of Souther Fell The view west from the summit takes in Blencathra and Bannerdale Crags. Souther Fell is a fell in the English Lake District. It stands to the south of Mungrisdale village in the Northern Fells. It is most famous for the appearance of a \\"spectral army\\", said to have been seen marching along its crest on Midsummer's Day, 1745. No such force was in the District at the time. Topography Souther Fell is the eastern extremity of Blencathra, a continuation of the arm which runs down from the summit over Doddick Fell and Scales Fell. A smooth slope falls eastward from Scales Fell to the col of Mousthwaite Comb at 1,425 ft. The ridge then turns northeast for two miles along the summit of Souther Fell. Mousthwaite Comb is a geographical oddity. To the north of the depression, running eastward, is the River Glenderamackin. To the south of the col, flowing westward is the same river. In the intervening time the Glenderamackin has run for six miles, surrounding Souther Fell on three sides like a moat. The Comb provides its only dryshod connection to other ground and even this is almost cut off by the tributary of Comb beck on the southern slope. The far northern end of the ridge falls quite steeply to a bend of the Glenderamackin, across which is the village of Mungrisdale. The eastern flanks are quite smooth and towards the south have been enclosed to provide pasture land. Southernfell, Far Southernfell and Hazelhurst are the farms here. At the southern end, on the turn of the ridge, is the rockier slope of Knotts, falling toward the main Keswick to Penrith road. The western side of the fell stands above the enclosed valley of the Upper Glenderamackin, looking across to Bannerdale Crags. Souther Fell has two principal tops and each stands above a patch of scree and rock on this face. A footbridge crosses the river just north of Mousthwaite Comb, the only reliable crossing between here and Mungrisdale village. Geology In common with much of the Northern Fells, the Kirk Stile Formation of the Skiddaw Group predominates. This is composed of laminated mudstone and siltstone with greywacke sandstone and is of Ordovician age.British Geological Survey: 1:50,000 series maps, England & Wales Sheet 29: BGS (1999) The \\"Spectral Army\\" of Souther Fell On the evening of Midsummers Day 1745, a line of marching troops, cavalry and even carriages was seen travelling along the summit ridge of Souther Fell. The ground over which they appeared to move was known to be too steep for such transport, but the procession continued unabated for some hours until night fell, constantly appearing at one end of the ridge and disappearing at the other. 26 sober and respected witnesses were assembled to view the proceedings and later testified on oath to what they had seen. The next day Souther Fell was climbed and not a footprint was found on the soft ground of the ridge. One scientific explanation offered was that this was some bizarre mirage or reflection of the army of Bonnie Prince Charlie, that day exercising on the Scottish coast,Wainwright, Alfred: A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells,Book 5 The Northern Fells: while another explanation suggests that the sighting was originally misidentifying the smoke from Germanic bonfire rituals, with the story of the \\"Spectral Army\\" evolving over the years through transmission and adaptation in the popular press.Matthews, Stephan: The Spectral Army of Souther Fell: The Story of a Story,: Summit Souther Fell has two main tops, although a number of other bumps crown the ridge. That to the north east is the true summit, the southern top being perhaps 30 ft lower. A small cairn marks the top. This being the last of the Northern Fells in that direction, the view across to the Pennines is uninterrupted. The Lakeland view peeps around the looming presence of Blencathra, taking in Great Gable, the Scafells, the nearer Helvellyn range and a portion of the Far Eastern Fells. Ascents From Scales on the A66 road an ascent can be made up Comb Gill to Mousthwaite Comb. From Mungrisdale Wainwright propounds a direct route across the fields behind the Mill Inn. Birkett however notes that this is no public right of way and suggests a diversion to the south.Birkett, Bill: Complete Lakeland Fells: Harper Collins (1994): References Category:Fells of the Lake District ","title":"Souther Fell"},{"id":"9422759","text":"East Lake Tohopekaliga (East Lake Toho for short) is a lake in Osceola County, Florida, United States.

The film stars Troy Donahue, Claudette Colbert, Karl Malden and Dean Jagger, with Connie Stevens, Diane McBain, Sharon Hugueny, Sylvia Miles, Madeleine Sherwood and Hayden Rorke. The film marked Claudette Colbert's last role in movies. Summary The film shows the story of conflict between a young, independently minded man and his stepfather, a ruthless tobacco tycoon.

When the novel was published in 1958 the New York Times called it an \\"impressive debut\\". Production The original director was Joshua Logan with John Patrick to write the script. Clark Gable was mentioned as a possible male lead. A nationwide talent search was launched to find the younger male lead although Anthony Perkins was also a front runner. Natalie Wood was announced as young female lead. Delmer Daves then became involved as director, which saw Troy Donahue come on board as the lead. Parts of the movie were shot in East Windsor and Poquonock (Windsor), Connecticut. Mildred Savage, on whose novel the film was based, was a frequent visitor to the set. She was quoted during filming as saying: > My central theme — and fortunately Mr. Daves agrees about this — is that > young people today are neither \\"beat\\" or \\"lost\\". I wanted to show an > affirmative hero who may be confused because of his youth and sex troubles, > but who is still masculine, unaffected and optimistic — able to get ahead on > his own two feet. The idea of setting this story in the tobacco industry > came last. It seemed sensible to put a vigorous, healthy young man to work > in the soil. Delmer Daves differentiated the film from his earlier A Summer Place: > There I tried to dramatize the terrible end of communication between parents > and children. Here, in this day of mass identification, I show the need for > a young man to establish his individual liberty against the world's > increasing push towards conformity. It was Claudette Colbert's first film in nine years. \\"I didn't really intend to make another picture\\", she admitted at the time. \\"I took this one because I felt it had a point of view. The mother wants to break the silver cord and lead a normal sex life of her own.\\" \\"Working with these kids is a little tough sometimes\\", said Karl Malden of the film's youthful cast. \\"Still, they're eager and they're learning. And we can always do retakes if something goes wrong.\\" Soundtrack Max Steiner composed the film score. On this film he made use of his belief that \\"every character should have a theme.\\" The Warner Bros. Records soundtrack (WS-1413) recording used five of the film's main themes in both a short version and a concerto versions. In addition to the \\"Tobacco Theme\\", (for tobacco heir Parrish McLean), \\"Paige's Theme\\", \\"Allison's Theme\\", \\"Lucy's Theme\\", and \\"Ellen's Theme;\\" the soundtrack included Steiner's song \\"Someday I'll Meet You Again.\\" Max Steiner conducted the Warner Bros.

It gained notoriety by moving acts such as Letters to Cleo, Big Catholic Guilt, Smackmelon, Tracy Bonham, The Sheila Divine, Quintaine Americana, and Semisonic on to major labels. Cherrydisc was founded in 1991 by entrepreneur John Horton and Fritz Johnson. Fritz left early on and John Horton was soon joined by friend and audiophile Graham Wilson. The local Boston music zine The Pit Report was originally affiliated with the label but soon split off to become its own entity. Between 1993 and 1996 the label grew to include 5–6 full-time employees, two contract graphic designers, and several rotating interns. They were the recipient of the 1993 Best of Boston award for the compilation album Crush and achieved nationwide indie-label recognition due to the quality of some of their signed artists as well as for their broad and successful product distribution through Sony's independent arm, R.E.D. The label functioned with varying degrees of success and peaked financially with the success of Letters to Cleo in 1995. The label then went through a growth stage and managed the growth with cash injections from major labels (for both moving acts on to major labels but also releasing and promoting initial albums of less-established major label acts) and international licensing deals. In 1992, CherryDisc released the cult favorite Meat The Stools, under their CherryStem Division, a division specifically created to handle The Stools music to help distance the label from the band. In late 1997, Cherrydisc relocated to a loft in Boston's Leather District and became notorious locally for their large in-house event parties for record- releases. Late artists signed to the label include Trona and The Sheila Divine. In 1997 Cherrydisc signed an international distribution and artist development deal with Roadrunner Records of New York. Cherrydisc was tasked with developing an Alternative Artist roster. Under the terms of the deal, Cherrydisc was to be financed handsomely and would be supported by Roadrunner's Publicity and Marketing departments. Soon after the contract was signed, a shake-up in Roadrunner's leadership left Cherrydisc without financial support. Roadrunner paid Cherrydisc only 25% of the contracted advances, leaving the label cash poor and unable to promote its new releases, or hire the necessary staff to operate the label. Horton lost his battle with Roadrunner's incoming president, which left the label in financial ruin. Cherrydisc closed its doors in 1998. In 2003 Horton launched children's music label Light Of The Moon Entertainment with the help of former CherryDisc employee Arun Seth. The label released Kizooks - Super Huge Very big Hits through a deal with New York-based Koch Records. The CD was distributed to all major US retail outlets including WalMart and Kmart. In 2007, songs from Kizooks continue to be in the top 20 downloads on iTunes children's music chart.

In typical temples of Odisha using the Kalinga style of architecture, the vimana is the tallest structure of the temple, as it is in the shikhara towers of temples in West and North India. By contrast, in large South Indian temples, it is typically smaller than the great gatehouses or gopuram, which are the most immediately striking architectural elements in a temple complex. A vimana is usually shaped as a pyramid, consisting of several stories or tala. Vimana are divided in two groups: jati vimanas that have up to four tala and mukhya vimana that have five tala and more. In North Indian temple architecture texts, the superstructure over the garbhagriha is called a shikhara. However, in South Indian Hindu architecture texts, the term shikhara means a dome- shaped crowning cap above the vimana.Shikhara, Encyclopaedia Britannica Architecture Jagannath Temple at Puri in the Kalinga style of architecture A typical Hindu temple in Dravidian style have gopuram in the four directions i.e. East - main entrance, North and south - side entrances, West - only opened on auspicious day where it is believed we will go directly to Heaven.The temple's walls are typically square with the outer most wall having four gopura, one each on every side, situated exactly in the center of each wall. This will continue to next tier depending upon the size of the temple. The sanctum sanctorum and its towering roof (the central deity's shrine) are also called the vimana. Generally, these do not assume as much significance as the outer gopuram, with the exception of a few temples where the sanctum sanctorum's roofs are as famous as the temple complex itself. Golden shrine of thumb Famous Shrines The kanaka-sabai (Golden Stage) at Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram, is another example. This shrine is entirely covered with golden plates, but is different in its structure and massive in size when compared to most other vimanas. Historical evidence states that during the ninth century, Parantaka I funded to cover this vimana with ornamental gold and it retains its glory even today. The Ananda Nilayam vimana of the Venkateswara Temple, Tirumala, is a famous example where the gopuram of the main shrine occupies a very special place in the temple's history and identity. Meenakshi Temple has two golden vimana, the huge one for Shiva and the second one for his consort, Meenakshi. The vimana of the Brihadisvara Temple, Thanjavur, is another example, with a very exaggerated height. This form is not very common. The Jagannath Temple, Puri, has the Neelachakra on the sikhara, i.e., the top of the vimana. It is a representation of Vishnu's most powerful weapon, the sudarshana chakra. The vimana of the Konark Sun Temple was the tallest of all vimana before it fell.

It lies north of Myrtle Beach State Park on Ocean Boulevard near Farrow Parkway.  DoubleTree Resort (formerly Springmaid Resort & Conference Center)  Colonel Elliott White Springs, a World War I Ace Fighter Pilot, purchased of oceanfront property in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina in 1948. The original accommodations resembled military barracks, the rooms containing built-in concrete beds with twin-size foam mattresses. The rooms were easily cleaned by hosing and brushing them down. Guests brought their own towels and sheets and were required to make their own bed. Rooms cost $2.00 per night or $1.00 per bed. The rates remained unchanged for almost 30 years. The resort was originally owned by the textile company Springs Industries, and available for Springs employees only. The resort opened to the public in 1953, but retained the Springmaid name until 2016. A large cafeteria was also built on property and the food was prepared at the commissary in Lancaster SC and was trucked to the beach daily. Eventually a full kitchen was added and food was prepared on site and food was served in the original cafeteria. Springmaid added their first semi-private rooms in 1956 consisting of two rooms adjoined by a common bath. The first private rooms were built in 1966. The administration office and four two-story buildings of private guestrooms were built between 1970 and 1973. These buildings were the first on property to have air conditioning. Beginning in 1989, some of the older rooms were torn down and construction began on two additional three-story buildings. The rooms in this building contained televisions (which were eventually added to all the rooms). Telephones were not added to any of the rooms until 1990. In 1992 a 60-unit tower which is now the Palmetto Building was opened along with the first floor of the Robert L. Reid Conference Center. In 1995, the Live Oak building, which consisted of 232 units, and the second floor of the Robert L. Reid Conference Center was opened. In 2001 the third floor of the Robert L. Reid Conference Center and another 154 rooms in the Palmetto building were opened. The Cypress building was renovated in 2001 and that completed the 485 unit resort. An affiliate of Integrated Capital of Los Angeles bought the resort in December 2014 for $40 million. The Live Oak and Palmetto towers, with 452 guest rooms, will be renovated. The Cypress building and Marlin's cafeteria have been torn down and will be replaced by a new registration area, bar and restaurant, along with a courtyard. The Springmaid Beach Resort was purchased by Hilton Hotels in 2016. Hilton remodeled the resort and renamed it to DoubleTree Resort.  Fishing pier  The original fishing pier was built in 1953, but was destroyed the next year by Hurricane Hazel. The pier was rebuilt in 1959 and destroyed again by an airplane. In 1973 a new pier was built on the north end of the resort and remained standing until it was destroyed on October 8, 2016 as Hurricane Matthew passed through the area shortly after making landfall a short distance south. The pier was the longest in Myrtle Beach, at 1060 feet long. Rebuilding of the pier began in May 2019 and the pier is scheduled to open in July 2020.

It is located near the historic border of Lesser Poland and Silesia, which goes along the Liswarta river. A few kilometers to the northwest, Lesser Poland meets another historic province of the country, Greater Poland. For centuries, until 1793 during the Partitions of Poland, the town belonged to Lelów County of Kraków Voivodeship. Annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia as part of New Silesia in 1807, it was passed to the Duchy of Warsaw, and then Congress Poland. In 1918 it returned to Poland, and was part of Kielce Voivodeship. After World War II, Krzepice remained in Kielce Voivodeship until 1950, when it became part of Katowice Voivodeship. The town is home to a sports club Liswarta, established in 1946. Etymology The name Krzepice, mentioned for the first time in 1356 as Crzepycze, comes from a last name Krzepa; most probably, members of this family lived in the area of the town. In a Latin language medieval document of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Wrocław (Liber fundationis episcopatus Vratislaviensis), written in 1295–1305, Krzepice is spelled Crippicz antiquum. History Buildings in the north-west corner of the Market church of St. James the Apostle in Krzepice In the Middle Ages, Krzepice was a border town, guarding the northwestern corner of Lesser Poland. In the 12th century, a wooden stronghold was built here, then it was replaced by a wooden castle, which in the 14th century was rebuilt into a stone complex. Today, only parts of a moat is all that remains of the castle. In 1357, King Kazimierz III Wielki erected a parish church. Krzepice was most probably incorporated in 1357, but there is speculation that it had taken place in the mid-13th century. In 1370, King Louis I of Hungary granted Krzepice as a temporary fee to Prince Władysław Opolczyk. After a few years, the town returned to Poland. On March 15, 1552, King Sigismund II Augustus specified the boundaries of the town. In its center there was a main market square, with six streets, and with parish church of St. Jacob. Due to convenient location, near the border with Silesia (which at that time was part of Kingdom of Bohemia), Krzepice became a local trade center, with fairs, and three market squares. This corner of the Kingdom of Poland was located away from main military conflicts, and the town prospered, especially in the period known as Polish Golden Age. It changed during the Swedish invasion of Poland (1655–1656), when both Krzepice and the ancient castle were destroyed by the Swedes. Ruins of the castle remained until 1927, when they were finally demolished. The town frequently burned (1450, 1527, 1656, 1867, 1881, 1903, 1904 1906), which was due to its wooden architecture. In 1870, Russian authorities of Congress Poland reduced Krzepice to the status of a village, as a reprisal for its inhabitants' participation in the January Uprising. Krzepice regained its town status in 1919, when already it was part of Kielce Voivodeship of the Second Polish Republic. =Jewish history= Krzepice used to have a large Jewish community before the onset of World War II, constituting 43% of the town’s total population. In early 1940, the Germans set up an open type ghetto there with about 1,800 inmates, along with Judenrat and the Jewish police. The Jews were forced to perform slave labor until the liquidation of the ghetto in June and July 1942, when most of them were sent in Holocaust trains to Auschwitz extermination camp. Those who remained were deported to the ghetto in Sosnowiec. Only a handful survived the Holocaust and subsequently left Poland. The stone-and- brick Synagogue in Krzepice, built around 1822, still stands although unused and in a dilapidated state. The historic Jewish Cemetery is close by. Transport Bypass Krzepice - National Road 43 (Częstochowa-Wieluń) Main highway connections from the Krzepice include those with Wieluń (to the north- west) and Częstochowa (to the south-east) via the National Road 43. A bypass of the town was opened in 2009. Krzepice is linked by rail to Wieluń and Katowice. It has a rail station, on a line from Herby Nowe to Wieluń, built in 1926.

He served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Altrincham in Cheshire from 1924 to 1933, when he resigned to become a High Court judge. Private life Atkinson was the son of Leonard William Atkinson, from Cheshire. He married Kathleen O'Neill Longridge in 1900. Their son Fenton Atkinson was born in 1906; he was later a judge in the High Court and then the Court of Appeal. After his first wife's death in 1947, Atkinson married Florence Morton Henderson in 1948; she was the widow of Colonel Michael Henderson. Career Atkinson was called to the Bar in 1897 and was appointed King's Counsel in 1913. In 1924, Atkinson was chosen by Altrincham Unionists to be their parliamentary candidate for the seat they had lost to the Liberals in 1923. He did not have long to wait before the 1924 general election, and he won the seat on a swing of 15%. At the 1929 general election, he again faced Robert Alstead, the Liberal he had unseated in 1924. The Labour party chose to field a candidate for the first time since 1922, which made Atkinson's job of holding the seat easier, giving him a majority of 18%. He was returned unopposed in 1931, and in 1933 he resigned from the House of Commons on being appointed a High Court judge, serving in the King's Bench Division until he retired in 1948. He was Treasurer of Lincoln's Inn in 1942. He served as a member of the Church Assembly (the forerunner to the General Synod) from 1950 to 1955.

Cochliobolus sativus also infects other plant parts and in conjunction with other pathogens causes common root rot and black point.  Introduction  Foliar blight, Helminthosporium leaf blight (HLB), or foliar blight has been a major disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. Foliar blight disease complex consists of spot blotch and tan spot. Spot blotch is favored in warmer environments, whereas tan spot is favored in cooler environments such as United States. Marcia McMullen (2009) Extension Plant Pathologist, Department of Plant Pathology, Fungal Leaf Spot Diseases of Wheat: Tan spot, Stagonospora nodorum blotch and Septoria tritici blotch, PP-1249 (Revised), February 2009 The tan spot forms of foliar blight appears in United States causing significant yield loss. With changed climatic conditions the disease is supposed to be increasing in cooler parts of the world. Among foliar blights the tan spot, caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, is the most destructive leaf spot disease found in all wheat classes throughout the growing season across North Dakota. The spot blotch form of foliar blight is severe particularly in warmer growing areas characterized by an average temperature in the coolest month above 17°C. In the past 20 years, HLB has been recognized as the major disease constraint to wheat cultivation in the warmer eastern plains of South Asia.Rosyara, U. R.; E. Duveiller, K. Pant and R. C. Sharma. 2007. Variation in chlorophyll content, anatomical traits and agronomic performance of wheat genotypes differing in spot blotch resistance under natural epiphytotic conditionsAustralasian Plant Pathology 36: 245–251.Proceedings of HLB symposium by CIMMYT (pdf download) About 25 million hectares of nontraditional wheat growing area are under the pressure of the disease. See: Knowing the Enemy: Foliar Blight Symptoms Early lesions are characterized by small, dark brown lesions 1 to 2 mm long without chlorotic margin. In susceptible genotypes, these lesions extend very quickly in oval to elongated blotches, light brown to dark brown in colour. They may reach several centimetres before coalescing and inducing the death of the leaf. Fruiting structures develop readily under humid conditions and are generally easily observed on old lesions. If spikelets are affected, it can result in shrivelled grain and black point, a dark staining of the embryo end of the seed. The small dark brown spots on the leaves contrast with the larger, light brown spots or blotches produced by tan spot and septoria avenae blotch. typical spot blotch sysmtom Spot blotch symptom Tan spot pathogen Foliar blight associated pathogens Crop losses In recent years, Helminthosporium leaf blights (HLB), caused by both Cochliobolus sativus and Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, have emerged as serious concerns for wheat cultivation in the developing world. The disease causes significant yield losses Sharma, R.C. and E. Duveiller. 2003. Selection Index for Improving Helminthosporium Leaf Blight Resistance, Maturity, and Kernel Weight in Spring Wheat. Crop Sci. 43:2031–2036. overall 22% to complete failure of crop under severe epidemics.  Control measures  The disease is very serious in different parts of the world. The management of this disease requires an integrative approach. An integrated approach The best way to control Helminthosporium diseases is through an integrated approach. It includes the use of a variety of resistance sources, such as hexaploid wheat from Brazil and China (some of which is rate- limiting), alien genes and synthetic wheats. In addition, appropriate management practices that enhance the health of the plant populations, in general, are critical. Cooperation of pathologists, breeders and agronomists will be necessary to ensure sustainable control of this group of diseases. Economic feasibility of recommended practices has to be determined as part of the research. Options for controlling tan spot and spot blotch include disease-free seed, seed treatment with fungicides, proper crop rotation and fertilization, cultural practices in order to reduce inoculum sources, the use of chemicals and the research of disease resistance. The latter offers the best long-term control at no cost for the farmer and is ecologically safe.  Seed health  In Brazil, it is recommended not to plant seed lots with more than 3% black point to limit spot blotch. Seed treatment may prove to be appropriate, although the inoculum remaining on secondary hosts or in the soil may reduce the treatment efficiency. Seed treatments with phytoalexin inducer appeared to provide good protection to wheat seedlings against B. sorokiniana infection. (Hait and Sinha, 1986). Seed treatment with fungicide will help protect germinating seed and seedlings from fungi causing seedling blights. Fungicide seed treatments include: captan, mancozeb, maneb, thiram, pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) or carboxin guazatine plus, iprodione and triadimefon (Stack and McMullen, 1988; Mehta, 1993). Seed-borne inoculum of P. tritici-repentis can be controlled with seed-applied fungicides, such as guazatine and guazatine + imazalil, but other chemicals are also effective.(Schilder and Bergstrom, 1993)  Rotations and crop management  Clearing or ploughing in the stubble, grass weeds and volunteer cereals reduce inoculum as does crop rotation (Diehl et al., 1982). Reis et al. (1998) indicate that eradicant fungicide treatment of the seed and crop rotation with non-host crops can control spot blotch. In the rice-wheat system of South Asia, little work has been done on the epidemiology of HLB and how management of the rotation crops affects spot blotch and tan spot, except as noted earlier. More quantitative information is required on the role of alternate rotations, soil and plant nutrition, inoculum sources and climate. In the rice-wheat system, there is a need for timely planting of wheat, better stand establishment and root development, increased soil organic matter, sufficient levels of macro- and micronutrients, and water and weed management (Hobbs et al., 1996; Hobbs and Giri, 1997). Crop rotation and organic manures will play a major role in HLB. This should favour beneficial soil organisms as well as better plant nutrition. In the rice-wheat system, it will be necessary to break the rotation with other crops to make it more sustainable, and this should help reduce disease problems in general. The use of oilseed rape in South Asia is common in mixture with wheat or in rotation. Since rape is known to have some fungitoxic effects upon decay, its effects on HLB would need research (Dubin and Duveiller, 2000). In the HLB complex, rotations would need to be sufficiently long to reduce the amount of soil inoculum. Cook and Veseth (1991) note that the kind of rotation crop may not be so important to root health as the length of time out of wheat. The rotation crops and length of rotation would have to be studied in relation to HLB. Apparently, sound management recommendations may antagonize specific diseases as in the case of tan spot. Tan spot has been controlled largely by cultural practices, such as rotation with non-host crops and removal or burial of stubble (Rees and Platz, 1992). Bockus and Claassen (1992) observed that rotation to sorghum was as effective as ploughing for control of tan spot, and under certain conditions, crop rotations as short as one year controlled tan spot. In South Asia, recent work by Hobbs and Giri (1997) indicates that minimum tillage may be the best way to reduce turnaround time from rice to wheat and thus permit the planting of wheat more timely. Since this probably increases inoculum of tan spot, it highlights the need for integration of disciplines to determine how best to achieve attainable yields.  Fungicides  Although pesticide use should be minimized, fungicides have proven useful and economical in the control of tan spot (Loughman et al., 1998) and spot blotch (Viedma and Kohli, 1998). The triazole group (e.g. tebuconazole and propiconazole) especially has proven to be very effective for both HLBs, and their judicious use should not be overlooked. However, it may provide acceptable control but not always economic return in commercial grain production. This is dependent on the price received for the wheat, the price of the fungicide and the percent yield increase from using the fungicide. Situations will differ significantly according to geographical areas and cropping conditions. Spot blotch in particular is a very aggressive disease, and under a favourable environment, spraying at one- to two-week intervals for as long as necessary may be needed to maintain the disease under control. For general information on management of the disease visit Ohio State University Link and FAO link  Breeding for resistance The wheat cultivars of South Asia have only low to moderate levels of resistance to spot blotch. However, genetic variation for resistance has been reported in a few wheat cultivars. The best sources of resistance, to date, were identified in the Brazilian and Zambian wheat lines. Recently, a few Chinese wheat genotypes from the Yangtze River valley were identified with acceptable levels of resistance to spot blotch. The following genotypes has been reported to have satisfactory level of resistance, although complete resistance or immunity is lacking: Sharma, R.C.; E. Duveiller, S. Gyawali, S.M. Shrestha, N.K.

CIMMYT wheat pathologist Dr. Duveiller and Rosyara at a spot blotch screening nursery at Rampur A study was conducted to determine microsatellite markers associated with resistance in the F7 progeny from a cross between the spot blotch-susceptible Sonalika and resistant G162 wheat genotypes. 15 polymorphic markers showed association with two bulks, one each of progeny with low and with high spot blotch severity. One of the interesting phenomena associated with foliar blight in some of susceptible cultivars is tolerance (low yield loss even at very high level of disease severity). In addition, the resistance seems to be associated with late maturity (which is an undesirable characteristic as late maturing genotypes need to face more heat stress than early ones), complete understanding of physiological association may aid to complete understanding of the host-pathogen system.

Also the AUDPC was positively correlated with the distance between adjacent vascular bundles and leaf thickness. The chlorophyll or general health indicators, SPAD and AUSDC values were higher in spot blotch resistant and tolerant genotypes. The findings the study underlined the importance of mesophyll structure and chlorophyllcontent in spot blotch resistance in wheat. Also tolerant genotypes responded in the same way as artificial defoliation showing mechanisms of nutrient balance playing role.Rosyara, U.R.;R.C. Sharma, S.M. Shrestha, and E.

Sci. 26:43-50.available online or click here Similarly, canopy temperature depression was found associated with foliar blight resistance. Leaf tip necrosis was found to be associated with foliar blight resistance and is suggested as phenotypic marker. Different studies are done to estimate heritability and increase selection efficiency. Heritability estimates were low to high in terms of AUDPC. To increase efficiency of selection use of selection index has been suggested. The index includes days to heading (maturity related trait), thousand kernel weight, and area under foliar blight disease progress curve.  References   Further reading  * Joshi, A. K.; R. Chand, S.

Due to its geographical location, New Jersey can generally be divided by New York City cuisine in the northern and central parts of the state and Philadelphia cuisine in the southern parts. Restaurants in the state often make use of locally grown ingredients such as asparagus, blueberries, cranberries, tomatoes, corn, and peaches.Caparulo 2003, pp. xiii. New Jersey is home to approximately 525 diners, the most of any state. Various foods invented in the state, such as the pork roll, and salt water taffy, remain popular there today. Campbell Soup Company is headquartered in Camden The state is known for its commercial food and industrial production, beginning with the founding of the Campbell's Soup Company, headquartered in Camden since 1869. Goya Foods, the largest Hispanic-owned food company in the United States, operates a state-of-the-art, sustainable corporate headquarters in Jersey City. M&M;'s candy has been produced in Hackettstown, New Jersey since 1958. Manischewitz, one of the top producers of Jewish food such as matzo and kosher wine, is headquartered in Newark, New Jersey. Food writer, influencer, and chef Anthony Bourdain was raised in Leonia, New Jersey. He often profiled New Jersey restaurants on his multiple television shows. Carlo's Bake Shop in Hoboken is the setting for TLC's reality television series, Cake Boss. Regional foods Due to its position between New York City and Philadelphia, the signature foods of both cities are very popular in their corresponding suburbs. In the New York Metropolitan Area regions of North and Central Jersey, pizza, bagels, pastrami, and submarine sandwiches (often called \\"subs\\", sometimes called heroes) are popular. In the Delaware Valley towns of South Jersey, hoagies (the Philadelphia term for the aforementioned submarine sandwich), cheesesteaks, soft pretzels, water ices, and scrapple are common. Several of these regional dishes have achieved popularity statewide. Irish potato candy are a familiar South Jersey treat as well. =North Jersey= There are a number of foods which are especially prominent in or unique to the Garden State. As with New York City, North Jersey is renowned as a hot dog stronghold, with several variants that have their roots in its cities. The ripper is perhaps the most famous type of hot dog native to New Jersey. It is deep-fried in oil until the casing bursts, or \\"rips\\", and might be best exemplified at Rutt's Hut, a longtime hot dog eatery in Clifton, New Jersey. Texas wieners are another type of hot dog that originated in the state. They are either grilled or deep-fried and served with spicy brown mustard, chopped onions, and a thin meat sauce similar to chili. Wieners ordered \\"all the way\\" are dressed with all three condiments. Another type of hot dog indigenous to North Jersey is the Italian hot dog, which originated at Jimmy Buff's in Newark in 1932 and is one of the foods most synonymous with North Jersey's Italian-American culture, especially in Essex County. The Italian hot dog is prepared by slicing a roll of round pizza bread in half (for a double order) or into quarters (for a single order), digging a pocket into it, and then spreading mustard along the inside of the roll. A deep-fried dog (two for a double order) is stuffed into the pocket, topped by fried or sauteed onions and peppers, and then followed by deep-fried potatoes that have been thinly sliced into discs or thickly-cut into chunks and drizzled with ketchup. Italian sausages can be substituted for the hot dogs and, as with their counterpart, are ordered as a single or double order. =Central Jersey= Taylor Pork Roll of Trenton. Tomato pie, found in Trenton; also a popular Philadelphia dish. The state capital of Trenton, located near the boundary of Central and South Jersey, is known for two foods in particular: tomato pie and pork roll. In Trenton, tomato pie is basically an interchangeable term for pizza, albeit with a subtle difference: While traditional pizzas are prepared by placing the cheese and toppings on top of the sauce and dough, tomato pies are made by laying the cheese directly on top of the dough, then adding the toppings, and finally spreading the sauce atop the mix. This creates a more tomato-intensive taste for the thin-crust pie. Pork roll is a sausage-like pork product developed by John Taylor in Trenton in the late 19th century, and has become a popular breakfast and sandwich meat throughout the Garden State. In South Jersey and elsewhere, it is often referred to as a pork roll due to the tube-like sack, or \\"roll\\", in which it is traditionally packaged, while in North Jersey it is usually called Taylor Ham. The meat is generally eaten sliced and grilled like Canadian bacon, but is also known to be fried. Also common is the pork roll, egg and cheese sandwich, in which pork roll is cooked on a griddle and then topped with a fried egg and American cheese and eaten on a hard roll. The Grease Trucks of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey have popularized \\"fat sandwiches\\", which are sandwiches usually consisting of various combinations of chicken fingers, french fries, mozzarella sticks, onion rings, and other fried foods. The Grease Trucks have been made famous by mentions in USA Today and Maxim Magazine, among other media outlets. =South Jersey= Salt water taffy, a staple of the Atlantic City area of the Jersey Shore since in the 1880s.Genovese, Peter. \\"Chew on this: 125 years later, Jersey Shore still daffy over salt water taffy\\" in The Newark Star Ledger, August 19, 2013 Salt water taffy is a soft taffy originally produced and marketed in the Jersey Shore resort town of Atlantic City beginning in the late 19th century, and is a staple candy and souvenir item of boardwalks in the state. It is widely sold throughout beachfront areas of the East Coast of the United States and Canada. Diner food  New Jersey is renowned for its multitude of diners, which number over 500, more than any other state. Many are open 24 hours a day. A large number of diners are owned or were founded by Greeks and offer Greek dishes like gyros in addition to standard diner fare. Typical cuisine includes staple American foods such as hamburgers, club sandwiches, meatloaf, and other simple fare. There is often an emphasis on breakfast foods such as eggs (including omelettes), waffles, pancakes, and French toast, and most diners serve breakfast all day. Coffee is ubiquitous at diners, if not always of high quality. Many diners in the state carry a full drink menu, including mixed drinks. Many also serve hand-blended milkshakes. The food is usually quite inexpensive, with a decent meal (sandwich, side dish, drink) available for less than ten dollars. Many establishments have transparent display cases in or behind the counter for desserts, typically including a variety of pies and cheesecakes. Specialties specific to New Jersey diners include the previously mentioned pork roll, egg, and cheese sandwich, as well as disco fries, a food similar to the Quebec dish of poutine. They consist of french fries, usually slightly overcooked, and covered with brown gravy and melted mozzarella cheese.

In other parts of the state, this is known as a \\"Reuben,\\" and this area views a sloppy joe using the more common definition of a hot sandwich of pan- cooked hamburger meat soaked in a sweet, tangy sauce with small pieces of diced bell peppers, usually served on a hamburger roll or Kaiser roll. * Jersey breakfast dog - danger dog (deep-fried bacon-wrapped hot dog) with eggs and melted cheese. * In and Outers - hot dogs that have been deep-fried until they blister slightly (see Danger dog) * Salt water taffy * New York-style pizza * Tomato pie * Sausage sandwich * Portuguese Charcoal BBQ * Beefsteak (banquet) * Panzerotti - mozzarella and tomato sauce filled deep fried dough pocket similar to but larger than an empanada Ethnic cuisine and enclaves In addition to its local foods, New Jersey boasts a plethora of ethnic cuisines due to its large immigrant population. Some of the more prominent examples include Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Taiwanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Middle Eastern, Italian, Polish, and Greek food. Cuban cuisine has also had an impact in New Jersey, especially in the Hudson County area. Typical Cuban food found in the state includes Christianos y Moros (also known as arroz Moros), lechon, the Cuban sandwich, arroz salteado and dulce de leche.

Police investigations into these reports failed to find any substantial evidence or locate any suspects. The phenomenon was initially and most frequently reported in the early 1990s.  Media coverage  In the early 1990s, reports emerged in the UK media concerning the purported conduct of persons claiming to be social workers. Most witnesses reported being visited by one or two women in their late twenties to early thirties who were dressed professionally. In some versions of the story, the visits included a woman accompanied by a man who seemed to be acting in a supervisory role. Visits consisted of an inspection of the children in the household, during which the \\"social workers\\" displayed strange behaviour. Claims about the nature of the \\"examinations\\" fed concerns that children were being sexually abused.  Police investigation  Police in South Yorkshire launched a major investigation into the phantom social worker phenomenon in 1990, known as \\"Operation Childcare.\\" The investigation became one of the largest in UK history, with 23 separate police forces participating.Dash 2000, p. 385. After a year of investigating, police had gathered 250 reports – of these, police believed only two cases were genuine and 18 deserved to be taken seriously. Criminologists speculated that even genuine cases may have involved self-appointed child abuse investigators, or individuals seeking to make false accusations, rather than child sexual abusers. No arrests were made and Operation Childcare has since been disbanded. Lothian and Borders Police set up a special unit to investigate the subject, but disbanded it in 1994 with no arrests.  Speculated origins  It is thought that reports of unidentified \\"social workers\\" attempting to take children away from their parents were merely scare stories or urban legends fuelled by the story of Marietta Higgs, a paediatrician from Cleveland, England who diagnosed 121 children as being victims of sexual abuse from their parents without any evidence or reason. Police believe some of the visits were made by vigilante citizens conducting their own child abuse investigations.Dash 2000, p. 385–6. Other reported visits can be explained by the misidentification of door-to-door salesmen, canvassers, and religious missionaries.

An amateur sumo champion, he turned professional in 1996 and reached the top makuuchi division in 1997. He earned twelve kinboshi or gold stars for defeating yokozuna, the second highest ever, and he was a runner-up in two tournaments. His highest rank was sekiwake. He is now a coach at Kasugano stable under the name Takenawa Oyakata. Career Born in Nanao, he was a rival of fellow top division wrestler Dejima in elementary school.Sumo Fan Magazine He was an amateur sumo champion at Takushoku University, winning the College Yokozuna title. He joined Kasugano stable through a connection to Chigonoura Oyakata (the former sekiwake Masudayama), who was a fellow Takushoku University alumni and a coach at the stable, and made his professional debut in January 1996. Because of his amateur achievements he had makushita tsukedashi status, and so his debut tournament was in the third highest makushita division. He made the jūryō division in November 1996, switching from his family name of Gotō and adopting the shikona of Tochinonada. He was promoted to the top makuuchi division three tournaments later in May 1997. Tochinonada had a strong start to his makuuchi career, earning special prizes for Fighting Spirit in consecutive tournaments in July and September 1997. He made his titled san'yaku debut that November at the rank of komusubi. However he could manage only six wins there and did not return to the san'yaku ranks until January 2001, when he made komusubi once again. He reached his highest rank of sekiwake in March 2001 and held it for two tournaments. He was runner-up in the January 2003 tournament, when he lost his first four matches but then rallied to win eleven in a row to finish three wins behind Asashōryū. He was also runner-up to Kaiō in September 2004, where he also scored 11–4. In May 1999 he injured ligaments in his left elbow in a match against Kaiō and had to sit out the following tournament in July. He did not miss any more bouts until six years later in July 2005 when he injured his right thigh on the second day and missed the rest of the tournament. Tochinonada during the pre-bout warm up in May 2009. During his long stay in the top division Tochinonada earned twelve kinboshi or gold stars for defeating yokozuna while ranked as a maegashira, which places him equal second on the all-time list, level with Takamiyama and behind only Akinoshima. His first kinboshi came in January 1998 when he defeated Akebono, and he earned his next three in three successive tournaments from May to September 1998. In November 2003 he defeated two yokozuna on two successive days, and was awarded the Outstanding Performance prize as well. He defeated all the yokozuna he met at least once, with the exception of Hakuhō (his victory over Takanohana was at sekiwake rank, meaning he was not eligible for a gold star on that occasion). His twelfth and final kinboshi came nearly four years after his previous one, in July 2008 against Asashōryū. Although Tochinonada touched the ground first, Asashōryū had already gone out of the ring, and was therefore shini-tai. ' 150px In November 2005 Tochinonada dropped to the juryo division, breaking a run of 52 consecutive tournaments in the top division since his entry in May 1997. However he immediately won the jūryō championship in January 2006 and was promoted straight back. He won his 500th career match in July 2007, producing a strong 10–5 score. He was promoted up the rankings to maegashira 2 in September 2007 and fought his first yokozuna bout since May 2005 when he met Hakuhō on the 4th day. He had a win over ōzeki Kotoōshū but finished the tournament with a 4–11 record. In March 2008 he recovered from losing his first six bouts to win eight in a row and achieve kachi-koshi. He was demoted to the jūryō division for the second time after the September 2009 tournament, and he moved back and forth between the top two divisions a number of times after that. In the January 2011 tournament, Tochinonada managed a 7–0 start after 7 days, his best ever, although he finished on 9–6. Following the retirement of Kaiō in the July 2011 tournament he became the active wrestler with the most wins in the top division (556), but could not avoid demotion to jūryō. In September he recorded his first ever make-koshi in the [jūryō division, scoring only 4–11. Retirement Following a performance with only three wins in the January 2012 tournament and facing certain demotion to the makushita division, he declared his retirement and missed his last match on the final day. He is remaining in the sumo world as a coach at his stable under the toshiyori or elder name Takenawa Oyakata. His official retirement ceremony or danpatsu-shiki took place at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan on 29 September 2012, with new yokozuna Harumafuji performing his dohyō-iri there for the first time. Fighting style Tochinonada was a yotsu-sumo wrestler, preferring grappling techniques that involve grabbing the opponent's mawashi. His favoured grip was hidari-yotsu (left hand inside, right hand outside), for which he was well known. His most common winning kimarite was yorikiri (force out) but he also regularly used his preferred inside grip to win by shitatenage (underarm throw). He was also fond of oshidashi (push out) and tsukiotoshi (thrust down). Trivia In March 1999 he became the first wrestler ever to win by default two days in a row. On Day 10 yokozuna Wakanohana withdrew, followed the next day by his brother Takanohana. However he did not receive a kinboshi for these victories.

In return, Amedeo Calliari and Nicolò Brighenti also signed by Triestina in co- ownership deal, for €325,000 and €425,000 respectively. Thus, the swap deal only involved €10,000 from Chievo to Triestina.US Triestina Calcio SpA Report and Accounts on 30 June 2009 D'Ambrosio and Cottafava then returned to Triestina on loan and Brighenti and Calliari were loaned to Lega Pro. The deal made Triestina received a player profit of €840,000 and €620,000 respectively, despite it was false, as the club received nothing but two youth players with speculative potential. On 30 June 2009 the club had a net equity of €2,933,043, (5.2 times equity to asset ratio) which if excluding aforementioned €1.46 million player profit, the club had even worse accounting result of €1,473,043. In January 2010 Triestina bought back D'Ambrosio in 4-year contract and sold Brighenti for €425,000 each.US Triestina Calcio SpA Report and Accounts on 30 June 2010 After Triestina re-admitted to Serie B in August 2010 (to replace Ancona), Cottafava was bought back by Triestina for €210,000.AC ChievoVerona Report and Accounts on 30 June 2011 and Calliari returned to Chievo for €220,000, thus a reverse flow of cash of €10,000. Both D'Ambrosio, Cottafava became the financial burden of Triestina as their accounting value €850,000 and €420,000 had to be amortize as a repayment of false profit gained in June 2009. On Chievo side, Brighenti's €850,000 and Calliari's €440,000 also became a burden for the club, which both were sold in a lower price and Chievo had to write-off the rest as a cost. =Gubbio & Latina= In September 2011 he joined Gubbio, the newcomer of Serie B. Gubbio also relegated in 2012. In August 2012 he joined U.S. Latina Calcio of third division. He won promotion to Serie B with the club.

He was born sighted, but developed glaucoma at the age of three. By the time his vision was completely gone, he was fluent on six instruments, including the guitar. Biography Born in Hertford, North Carolina, he moved to Westbury, Long Island at age sixteen. His first professional gig was at the Brooklyn Paramount, where he was a back-up guitarist for Alan Freed's Rock and Roll shows. He also became a regular at Long Island clubs. In 1961, Buster composed his first original song \\"Looking For a Home\\" while living in Glen Cove. First recorded on Josie/Jubilee after winning a talent contest at Harlem's Apollo Theater in 1964, Buster released \\"Looking For a Home\\". He recorded a series of singles there, including his biggest hit in 1968, Doc Pomus' \\"Young Boy Blues\\". Buster's last single with Josie was \\"City of Blues\\" / \\"Cry Me a River\\". His singles and several new compositions were compiled for the 1970 album, Looking For a Home that was finally by the UK label Sequel in 1997. Al Kooper covered \\"Looking For A Home\\" on his 1970 album Kooper Session, released on Columbia Records. Buster changed his focus, concentrating on live blues with his band, The Soul Brothers. Buster married his wife, Mary, in 1969. In 1995, Buster recorded his Bullseye release, Right On Time. This release brought him worldwide exposure, with a W.C. Handy Award nomination, and a runner-up award for Living Blues magazine's Critics' Award. His 2000 CD Work Your Show opened up mass media exposure via CBS This Morning, Late Night with Conan O'Brien, Late Show with David Letterman, on Dan Aykroyd's House of Blues Hour, international music festivals, and articles in Juke Blues, Backyard Blues and 20th Century Guitar magazines. In 2000, Buster began his own label with friends Steve Kleinberg and Ayanna Hobson, where he released his final CD, Little Buster and the Soul Brothers, Live Volume One. His band consisted of himself on guitar and vocals, Jerry Harshaw on saxophone, Frank Anstiss on drums, Alan Levy on bass and Robert Schlesinger on keyboards. As Andy Breslau said in the liner notes for Right On Time, > \\"Edward 'Little Buster' Forehand is a sublimely talented soul singer, a > tough blues guitarist and a sure-handed songwriter with a knack for making > rhythm and blues songs that evoke the classic 1960s sound. As one of New > York's great undiscovered treasures, Buster has played the Long Island club > circuit for over four decades.\\" During four decades many musicians honed their skills in Buster's band. These included Lee Vaughn on saxophone, Val and Cousin Brucie on bass guitar, Lionel Cordew on drums, Jonathan Kampner on drums, Eileen Murphy on drums, Chris Candida on drums, Ed Hoey on percussion, Gene Cordew on keyboards, Roast Beef Joe on keyboards, Mitch Weiss on chromatic harmonica MitchWeiss, and guitarists Scott Ross, and Stevie Cochran. In 2004, Little Buster suffered from a series of strokes. In May 2006, he died as a result of complications from those strokes and diabetes. He received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Long Island Blues Society in 2002 for his efforts on behalf of music. He was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame in 2006.

It has always been the headquarters location of the railway. Temporary terminus Until the opening of the Dungeness extension in 1928, New Romney was the terminus for trains from Hythe. The platforms were located in the area in front of the restaurant and model exhibition. The opening of the Dungeness extension required the construction of new platforms at a lower level, the original platforms being at road-level, and therefore inappropriate for accessing the road under-bridge by which the new Dungeness tracks passed under the adjacent main road. The current station was built in the 1930s, and retained the split-level organisation, with high-level terminating platforms, and low-level through platforms to Dungeness. thumb The railway closed in 1940 when it was taken over the military but the railway re-opened in 1946 after the second world war New Romney was again a temporary terminus, until the Dungeness extension had been repaired and reduced to a single-track operation. New Romney was the scene of the famous newsreel of Laurel and Hardy reopening the Dungeness line in 1947. Station rebuilding The evolution of New Romney station has been somewhat organic, with work taking place over a span of many years. However, the late 1970s saw a very significant reconstruction of the station, with the provision of an all-over station roof, and the expansion of the low-level through platforms. A total of 9 'effective' platform roads existed following this rebuild. Two platforms remained (but without designation) at the old high-level station; a further four were provided under the station roof, numbered platforms 1, 2, 3, and 4; an additional three lines ran parallel, also under the main roof, but without physical platform surfaces, being designed for storage of passenger coaches. The high-level platforms saw very little subsequent use, other than for storage of rolling stock, and were largely removed (apart from short stubs) in the early 1980s. Finally, in the 1990s, the relocation of the main locomotive turntable led to the removal of all trace of the old high-level platforms, whose physical location has now been entirely taken over by extensions to the station restaurant. Facilities and departmental bases =Company offices= The registered office of the railway company is located on the station site, although it has a separate entrance from the main road. Commonly known as the 'front office' this is the centre of corporate administration. There are also offices within the station site for the railway's General Manager, and for the principal departmental managers (operations, commercial, engineering). =Station operations= As a major railway station, the site necessarily includes a large booking office, shop, and cafeteria. There is also an extensive museum and model exhibition hall. =Train control= There is a signal box for local train control, and also the main Control Centre for train operation across the whole railway. The latter is staffed by a Control Officer, who is in constant radio contact with all signal boxes, locomotives, and (where appropriate) station staff, travelling guards, and engineering teams. =Locomotive storage and maintenance= The original engine shed is still in use, but was designed to accommodate only nine locomotives. In recent years it has been considerably extended, more than doubling the original size. This shed is now capable of housing all the railway's locomotives, as well as an engineering centre capable of work from minor running repairs to full locomotive overhauls, together with the necessary mess facilities for engineering staff. Also on the New Romney site are a separate locomotive erecting shop, and a paint shop where locomotives and other rolling stock can be re-liveried. Although there is a secondary engine shed at Hythe station, all locomotives are now based at New Romney locomotive shed. =Permanent Way headquarters= The Permanent Way department is also headquartered at New Romney. Its original premises have also proved inadequate, and a large new Permanent Way Shed has recently been constructed just outside (and north of) the main station site. This shed contains extensive storage space as well as running lines for the storage of the department's light locomotives, mess coach, and wagons. =Heritage storage= The provision of a new Permanent Way headquarters has allowed the former facility to be given over to a small heritage group who are developing an archive of historical material and a small collection of restored heritage vehicles, which may be used on special trains. =Carriage and wagon= Carriages and wagons are built and maintained on-site at New Romney in a dedicated 'Carriage and Wagon Department'. Its shed was formerly one of the larger facilities at the station, but is now dwarfed by both the new Permanent Way Shed, and the extended Locomotive Shed. =Other facilities= Certain smaller departments are also based at New Romney, but are less evident as they occupy limited space. Examples include the 'Signals and Telecommunications Department' who maintain the railway's signalling infrastructure and internal communications, and the 'Commercial Department', responsible for marketing. The site also houses the other general facilities associated with major tourist destinations, such as lavatories, children's play area, picnic facilities, and a large car park. There is also some on-site accommodation for staff members and volunteers.

History The first part of line to Dungeness was opened on 24 May 1928, a year after the line reached New Romney. However, construction was complete only as far as The Pilot Inn, where a turning triangle was installed, so that locomotives could change direction when preparing to return to New Romney or Hythe. Construction work continued towards Dungeness, and the final section of the line (including this station) opened in early August 1928. Operations have continued at this station ever since except 1940-1947. Description It is one of only a very few stations in England to be situated on a balloon loop, allowing trains to return with the engine pointing forwards without needing to uncouple and reverse the locomotive, or use a turntable. Facilities at this station included two booking offices (one currently redundant), a shop, an extensive cafeteria and restaurant, toilets, and a waiting shelter. There is a water tower for the benefit of steam locomotives. Until 2017 there was only one formal (concreted) platform, although in the summer trains sometimes arrived at and departed from the station's run-round loop even though no platform surface was provided. Since 2017 a second platform surface has been provided. The station was temporarily closed in October 2015 for extensive re-building with an expected completion date of Easter 2016. This plan was not fulfilled however as the contractor appointed to undertake the work went into receivership shortly after demolition of the existing buildings was complete. Work was re-commenced by a new contractor shortly before Christmas 2015 and by late January 2016 the foundations were largely complete.Letter to railway shareholders dated 27 January 2016 The station re-opened for Easter 2016 using RML2360, a Routemaster from the Arriva London heritage fleet, as a temporary booking office and souvenir shop. This vehicle had previously been rebuilt as an exhibition bus and was ideally suited for the purpose. The re-building work at Dungeness was finished in May 2016.

He was a prominent Unionist in Richmond, Virginia during the American Civil War. Early and family life Botts was born in Dumfries, Virginia to prominent lawyer Benjamin Gaines Botts (1776 - 1811) and his wife Jane Tyler Botts (1782 - 1811). Both of his parents died in the Richmond Theatre fire on 26 December 1811, so John and his siblings were raised by relatives in Fredericksburg. Botts attended the common schools in Richmond, Virginia, then studied law. He married Mary Whiting Blair (1801-1841), and they had several children. Two sons (John and Alexander) died very young; their firstborn son, Archibald Blair Botts (1826-1847), joined the U.S. Army and died in Mexico in 1847, and their daughter Virginia A. Botts (1840-1862) also predeceased her father. Thus, only Beverly Blair Botts (1830-1897), Rosalie S. Botts Lewis (1837-1878), and Isabella McLain Botts Lewis (1841-1928) survived their parents. \\"John Minor Botts entry at Find A Grave\\" Career After admission to the Virginia bar in 1830, Botts moved to Henrico County, Virginia outside Richmond. He operated a plantation called \\"Half Sink\\" on the Chickahominy River in Varina Farms area about nine miles east of downtown Richmond. He used the progressive agricultural methods advocated in the 'Southern Planter', as well as slave labor. Botts also raised racehorses and practiced law.\\"John Botts biographical entry at Education@LibraryOfVirginia\\" =Political career= Botts, circa 1850 Botts lost his first run for political office in 1831, but won the following year and represented Henrico County in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1833 to 1839.Cynthia Miller Leonard, The Virginia General Assembly 1619-1978 (Richmond: 1978) pp. 368, 372, 376, 380 and 385 (succeeding William B. Randolph on December 24, 1835) In 1835, he seemed to lose to William B. Randolph, but successfully challenged the results in court. In 1836, he again appeared to lose, to William N. Whiting, but again won a court challenge and was seated. In 1838, voters elected Botts as a Whig to the United States House of Representatives and William N. Whiting succeeded him as Henrico's state delegate. Unlike most Whigs, Botts opposed the Second Bank of the United States on constitutional grounds, but also considering President Andrew Jackson's veto of the bank's renewed charter encroachment upon Congress's powers, therefore by 1841 Botts favored a national bank. Botts was one of the few southern representatives to oppose the Democrats' \\"gag rule\\" (refusing to receive or air) antislavery petitions, he argued that violated the constitutional right to petition the government and also eliminated an important safety valve which relieved sectional agitation. Botts served in Congress from 1839 to 1843 however he was defeated for reelection in 1842 (following redistricting after the 1840 census). Although a slaveholder, Botts vehemently opposed extension of slavery into territories, and blamed Democrat John C. Calhoun for increasing sectional animosities by trying to annex Texas . On July 18, 1842, Botts introduced a resolution that levied several charges against the President and called for a nine-member committee to investigate his behavior, with the expectation of a formal impeachment recommendation. The Botts bill, however, was tabled until the following January, when it was rejected after Botts' defeat for re-election, 127−83.Chitwood, p. 303; Seager, p. 169. After this defeat, Botts continued to publish letters and articles opposing Texas' annexation. Botts won election to Congress again in 1846, serving from 1847 to 1849. He was chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs from 1847 to 1849, using it to support the Army (in which his son fought and died) rather than to oppose the war. Botts again lost his reelection bid in 1848, but he was elected again in 1850. Botts also served as one of six delegates representing the city of Richmond and the counties of Charles City, Henrico, and New Kent in the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850-1851. There, Botts chaired the committee on the Bill of Rights and argued for abolishing the death penalty and imprisonment for debt, as well as for extending the franchise and giving more voice to Western Virginians. He also proposed requiring that before any manumission of a slave, the owner must either arrange for the person's travel out of the state or secure legislative permission to remain in the state. Botts resumed practicing law in Richmond in 1852. With the demise of the Whig party (whose last national convention he attended in 1852), he ran for Congress on the Know Nothing Party ticket in 1854, but lost. His opposition to the admission of Kansas as a slave state also bucked public opinion in Virginia. =Prelude and American Civil War= Botts was not fond of the Democratic party. He believed that Virginian governor Henry A. Wise had secretly planned John Brown's 1859 raid to inflame the citizenry. With the support of Anna Ella Carroll, Botts attempted to unite the Know Nothing party with the new Republican party, but failed to win the support of either as a presidential candidate in 1860. During the presidential election of 1860, Botts aligned with the United States Constitutional Union Party and supported John Bell.\\"Presidential.; The Campaign in Virginia. John Minor Botts in the Field---He Denounces the Disunionists.\\", The New York Times, October 2, 1860 Though Bell was outpolled nationally by both the winning candidate Republican Abraham Lincoln and the Northern Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, Botts continued to support the principles of the Constitutional Union party. Even Carroll before her death acknowledged Botts was too outspoken and brusque to attract enough support. Botts failed to attract sufficient support as a Unionist delegate to attend Virginia's Secession Convention of 1861, although fellow Unionist John Brown Baldwin was elected. President Lincoln met separately with Baldwin and Botts, who later published different accounts of their meetings, neither of which stopped Virginia from seceding. Botts blamed Baldwin for keeping Lincoln's peace offer secret while his native state moved toward secession. He retired to his Henrico County farm after Virginia declared its secession in the American Civil War, but continued to write letters to newspaper editors and remained uncompromisingly Unionist in his sentiments.John Minor Botts, \\"A Bold Protest Against Disunion.; Letter From John Minor Botts Protesting Against Secession.\\", The New York Times, December 11, 1860 Through the war, Botts refused to fight against Virginia, but remained in the Commonwealth.John Minor Botts, \\"A Despairing Patriot.; Important Letter from Hon. J.M. Botts.\\", The New York Times, May 3, 1861 On March 2,1862, Richmond's Confederate provost marshal John H. Winder jailed Botts and fellow Unionist Franklin Stearns without trial for espousing Unionist positions after the Confederacy suspended the right of habeas corpus.\\"IMPORTANT FROM THE SOUTH.; Great Excitement in the Rebel Capital. Full Particulars of the Arrest of John Minor Botts and Other Prominent Citizens.\\", The New York Times, March 7, 1862McPherson, James, Battle Cry of Freedom, Penguin Books, 1990, , p.434 About 150 people were eventually picked up, and Stearns was later placed under house arrest in his Richmond warehouse, where his family could care for him. Botts stated that while he was in captivity Captain George W. Alexander attempted to persuade him to join the Confederate army as a brigadier general in exchange for his freedom. Botts spent eight weeks in solitary confinement. He was released after promising not to publish any more incendiary letters, and in January 1863 moved to a plantation he had won gambling, Auburn, in Culpeper County, Virginia, where Botts entertained both Union and Confederate officers at various times. Botts had promised he would move away from Richmond to ensure his pardon. He was arrested on October 12, 1863 by order of Confederate General J. E. B. Stuart, for entertaining Union officers (although three of his slaves had absconded for Union lines and he requested their return but was denied), but released later the same day. =Postwar= In 1864, the rump general assembly at Alexandria attempted to elect Botts to the U.S. Senate, but he declined. On the night of President Lincoln's assassination, several men arrived at his house and attempted to rob Botts after he answered their knock, but he closed the door in their faces.\\"AN ATTACK ON JOHN MINOR BOTTS\\", The New York Times, June 4, 1865 In May 1866, Botts presided over a Unionist convention, and became a delegate to the Southern Loyalists' Convention in Philadelphia later that year, where he argued against universal manhood suffrage. Botts proposed gradual emancipation of slaves, and would allow only some African Americans to vote. However, Radical Republicans defeated the Southern Unionists, and the Reconstruction Era began. Botts was defeated when he ran to become a delegate to Virginia's Constitutional Convention of 1867-1868, eventually led by John Curtiss Underwood. Botts last addressed Republicans in February 1868. Death and legacy Botts died on January 8, 1869 in Culpeper, Virginia.\\"OBITUARY.; John Minor Botts\\", The New York Times, January 9, 1869 He was survived by one son, two daughters, and his younger brother Charles Tyler Botts (1808-1884), who was a journalist in California. John Minor Botts was interred in the Shockoe Hill Cemetery in Richmond, as had been his wife Mary and at least their son Archibald, and as would be fellow unionists Elizabeth Van Lew and Franklin Stearns. John's grave marker reads: \\"He was under all circumstances an inflexible friend of the American Union. 'I know no North, no South, no East, no West. I know only my Country, my whole Country, and nothing but my Country.'\\" Elections of 1846, 1848, 1850 Botts was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1846 with 55.37% of the vote, defeating Democrat Walter D. Leake. He then failed to be re-elected to Congress in races held in 1848 and 1850, but he was elected as a delegate to the Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850 where he spoke as a reformer to expand the Virginia electorate.Heinemann, Ronald L., et al. Old Domion, New Commonwealth: a history of Virginia, 1607-2007, 2008 , p. 189-190 Memoirs Botts published his memoirs, The Great Rebellion: Its Secret History, Rise, Progress, and Disastrous Failure (1866).

His usual position was as a fly half. He spent most of his club career (15 out of 17 seasons as senior player) with Rovigo which he entered at the age of 6. He also spent one season each with Rugby Roma in 2000–2001 and Calvisano in 2006–2007. Scanavacca won his first cap for Italy on August 1999 against Uruguay. Since then he played 11 full international games until 2007 but never took part to a World Cup.

Scanavacca was \\"disappointed\\". Just some months before his dismissal, during the 2007 Six Nations Championship, Scanavacca scored the whole amount for his team (a try and a conversion) at Twickenham against England (that defeated Italy 20–7).

Once a busy station serving four directions, it closed in 1985 to British Rail services. A new station the other side of Station Road bridge was opened by the SVR in 1997 as part of a standard gauge heritage railway to Tunbridge Wells West.  Early years  The first Groombridge station was opened in 1866 by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) with the extension of its Three Bridges to Tunbridge Wells Central Line to Tunbridge Wells; its importance increased two years later when the line from Lewes was completed, and yet again with the opening of the Cuckoo Line opening up routes to Polegate and Eastbourne. At this time trains from Lewes and Uckfield could only reach East Grinstead by reversing at Groombridge. The station buildings were designed by Charles Henry Driver. Authority was therefore obtained in 1878 to lay a single track spur south of Ashurst Junction which would enable services to bypass Groombridge. Although completed in 1888 this spur remained largely unused until 1914 . It was eventually doubled to handle increased traffic on the Cuckoo Line and regular services to Uckfield. This spur thus reduced the importance of Groombridge as a junction station as direct Victoria - Crowborough/Uckfield services no longer had to reverse at Groombridge. The opening of the spur meant that more services were routed through Eridge which became the point where London trains were divided for the two lines south. To compensate for this loss, slip coaches were shed from some down trains at Ashurst. Upon the completion of the Cuckoo Line in 1880, the line between Eridge and Groombridge was doubled. At the same time, a crossover was constructed on the western side of Groombridge station, together with associated signalling equipment, and later the Groombridge West signal box. A second signal box, \\"Groombridge Junction\\", was provided on the opening of the Cuckoo Line, and a third, \\"Groombridge West\\" (the first signal box's name was changed to \\"Groombridge East\\"), was added in 1888 after the opening of the Oxted Line. Within 10 years of nationalisation, the three signal boxes had been closed by British Rail and replaced by a single box on 23 November 1958 when the Groombridge section was resignalled.  Main station building  Groombridge Station frontage Groombridge station building situated on the east side of Station Road is architecturally \\"the exact counterpart in miniature of Tunbridge Wells\\", and constructed of red brick with string courses of blue and white brick, including coloured brick reveals to the doors and windows. The stationmaster's original residence was on the western side of the building adjacent to a booking hall, while at the same time a new goods and parcels office was added to the eastern end of the building, next to the gentlemen's toilets. A subway led from the main platform to the island platform where until 1896 there were no passenger facilities; upon the urging of a passenger, a waiting room and buffet were provided at a cost of £2,300. The station was equipped with three platform faces: the main station platform was used for down trains, whilst the far side of an island platform served the up trains. A double track ran through the station, with a third line splaying out to the other side of the island before merging once again with the line to Tunbridge Wells. Four sets of goods sidings lay to the north of the main station serving a carriage dock, blacksmith's shop and stable. The extensive goods yard and generous facilities did not, however, see much use, and the Southern Railway used the station as a collection point for empty wagons and, at one point, as a holding yard for Tunbridge-bound trains. A footbridge was installed in 1889 to the west of the station to carry the footpath crossing the railway line to pass over the embankment; this replaced deep cutting steps which led down the embankment on either side of the footpath, the use of which was becoming ever more dangerous with the increasing traffic. By 1899 the levels of traffic generated from the Oxted Line prompted the LBSCR to invest in extending the island platform and re- aligning the track around it.  Decline  Notice announcing the line's closure in 1985 Until 1965 north-south services were run in two sections: Victoria - Tunbridge Wells West, and Tunbridge Wells West - Brighton/Eastbourne. These two sections interconnected at Groombridge where with Eastbourne and Tunbridge Wells coaches were detached from London trains; traffic grew from around 80 trains per day in the 1900s to 120 in the 1930s and more than 200 per day in the 1950s. The pattern of operations changed completely in the wake of the Beeching Report when the relative importance of Groombridge and Eridge as railway junctions diminished with the closure of one after another of the lines in the area. The Cuckoo Line was the first to go in June 1965, followed by the line from Three Bridges and East Grinstead in January 1967 and then the Uckfield line to the south of Uckfield in 1969. The line between Ashurst Junction and Groombridge, was taken out on 5 January 1969. At the same time, the signal box opened in 1958 was closed leaving the block signalling section between Tunbridge Wells West and Birchden Junction. State of the station shortly after closure. The section from Birchden Junction to Grove Junction remained open with an hourly off peak 3-coach DEMU shuttle between Eridge and Tonbridge with connecting services at Eridge was provided for Uckfield line passengers. By the 1980s the section had been gradually run- down with little maintenance, disruptions to service patterns and the reduction of services to a dozen or so per day, all of which took its toll on passenger numbers, although some commuter traffic did remain. Groombridge station was staffed on the morning shift only by the wife of a railwayman at Tunbridge Wells West, and she kept the station clean and presentable, whilst the tracks outside became overgrown, the 1958 signal box remained boarded-up and the goods yard contained a moribund coal merchant's business. In 1985 the Department for Transport gave British Rail the go-ahead to close the line from Eridge to Tunbridge Wells provided alternative bus services were provided, and it was announced that the last service would run on 6 July. Empty carriage stock trains continued to pass through the station until the last train on 10 August 1985 after which the line was closed completely. A private company called \\"Surrey Downs Ltd\\" proposed running a joint service with BR from Tonbridge to Uckfield, but this never materialised amid scepticism from BR that somebody outside the industry could make a loss-making line pay.  Revival  Spa Valley Railway Platform (looking towards High Rocks) In 1996 the Spa Valley Railway acquired the trackbed between Tunbridge Wells West and Birchden Jn and, after much hard work, restored a public service from Tunbridge Wells West to Groombridge in August 1997. As the original Groombridge station is now a private residence and the old ticket offices are now offices for a local financial adviser, it was necessary to build a new station on the opposite side of the road bridge with access via the old main station platform which has been extended to the new station. The island platform has been demolished and houses have been built on part of the trackbed requiring the new single track to curve along the trackbed of the old up loop line into the new station. Spa Valley Railway Platform Canopies have been erected on the station, using the former canopy supports from Gravesend West station. A new signal box is now under construction as part of the extension to Eridge.http://www.spavalleyrailway.co.uk The signal box has been far updated from the current picture a LBSCR signal frame (originally from Birchden Junction signal box) has been installed and the box first operated on 1 August 2014.

From 1973 to 1975 he attended the Musikhochschule in Graz, Austria, studying classical composition and jazz piano. In Vienna he performed in a nightclub as a solo jazz pianist, joined later by saxophonist Wolfgang Puschnig. The duo formed the core of an ensemble that in 1977 became the Vienna Art Orchestra. Rüegg's distinctive, often humorous compositions have drawn on a range of influences from traditional folk music to classics. He has also led the VAO to explore the big band repertory of American jazz composers such as Duke Ellington. Besides the traditional big-band complement, his orchestrations have prominently featured such instruments as the tuba, piccolo, bass clarinet, alphorn, exotic percussion, and wordless vocals. Rüegg has composed hundreds of pieces for the Vienna Art Orchestra, other European big bands, and classical orchestras, as well as theatre music and film music. Since 1994 he has composed several works for soloist and chamber orchestra. Besides managing the VAO, Rüegg has conducted workshops in Europe, worked as artistic director for music festivals, and headed multimedia and music-related projects.

This theory asserts that individuals hold a basic or 'naïve' theory of psychology (\\"folk psychology\\") to infer the mental states of others, such as their beliefs, desires or emotions. This information is used to understand the intentions behind that person's actions or predict future behavior. The term 'perspective taking' is sometimes used to describe how one makes inferences about another person's inner state using theoretical knowledge about the other's situation. This approach has become popular with psychologists as it gives a basis from which to explore human social understanding. Beginning in the mid-1980s, several influential developmental psychologists began advocating the theory theory: the view that humans learn through a process of theory revision closely resembling the way scientists propose and revise theories. Children observe the world, and in doing so, gather data about the world's true structure. As more data accumulates, children can revise their naive theories accordingly. Children can also use these theories about the world's causal structure to make predictions, and possibly even test them out. This concept is described as the 'Child Scientist' theory, proposing that a series of personal scientific revolutions are required for the development of theories about the outside world, including the social world. In recent years, proponents of Bayesian learning have begun describing the theory theory in a precise, mathematical way. The concept of Bayesian learning is rooted in the assumption that children and adults learn through a process of theory revision; that is, they hold prior beliefs about the world but, when receiving conflicting data, may revise these beliefs depending upon their strength.  Child development  Theory-theory states that children naturally attempt to construct theories to explain their observations. As all humans do, children seek to find explanations that help them understand their surroundings. They learn through their own experiences as well as through their observations of others' actions and behaviors. Through their growth and development, children will continue to form intuitive theories; revising and altering them as they come across new results and observations. Several developmentalists have conducted research of the progression of their theories, mapping out when children start to form theories about certain subjects, such as the biological and physical world, social behaviors, and others' thoughts and minds (\\"theory of mind\\"), although there remains controversies over when these shifts in theory-formation occur. Part of their investigative process, children often ask questions, frequently posing \\"Why?\\" to adults, not seeking a technical and scientific explanation but instead seeking to investigate the relation of the concept in question to themselves, as part of their egocentric view. In a study where Mexican- American mothers were interviewed over a two-week period about the types of questions their preschool children ask, researchers discovered that the children asked their parents more about biology and social behaviors rather than nonliving objects and artifacts. In their questions, the children were mostly ambiguous, unclear if they desired an explanation of purpose or cause. Although parents will usually answer with a causal explanation, some children found the answers and explanations inadequate for their understanding, and as a result, they begin to create their own theories, particularly evident in children's understanding of religion. This theory also plays a part in Vygotsky's social learning theory, also called modeling. Vygotsky claims that humans, as social beings, learn and develop by observing others' behavior and imitating them. In this process of social learning, prior to imitation, children will first post inquiries and investigate why adults act and behave in a particular way. Afterwards, if the adult succeeds at the task, the child will likely copy the adult, but if the adult fails, the child will choose not to follow the example. Comparison with other theories =Theory of mind (ToM)= Theory-theory is closely related to theory of mind (ToM), which concerns mental states of people, but differs from ToM in that the full scope of theory-theory also concerns mechanical devices or other objects, beyond just thinking about people and their viewpoints. =Simulation theory= In the scientific debate in mind reading, theory-theory is often contrasted with simulation theory, an alternative theory which suggests simulation or cognitive empathy is integral to our understanding of others.

The knight family came to the parish of Paprotnia in the area of Drohiczyn most likely from Masovia during the settlement led by Janusz I of Warsaw in the second half of the 14th century, or when PodlaskieUn transferred under the Lithuanian rule of Vytautas in 1405, who continued the settlement of Polish knights from areas of Masovia, as well as Łęczyca Voivodeship and Kuyavia in Podlaskie which had been deserted by the invasions of the Teutonic Knightss and Yotvingianss .‘Verbum Nobile’ Nr 16, 2007 – art. Źródła, Genealogie: ‘Drobna Szlachta Województwa Podlaskiego (II). Ziemie Drohicka i Mielnicka.’ Tomasz Jaszczołt, Łukasz Lubicz-Łapiński The earliest documentation of the surname Skwierczyński is as old as the early 15th century. 15th century judal books make numerous mentions of the family. The oldest one relates to Jakusz of Skwierczyn (currently divided into Skwierczyn Ruski and Skwierczyn Lacki, and previously Skwierczyn Duży and Skwierczyn Mały) who donated part of Skwierczyn Mały to the church in Paprotnia in 1429 – brothers Stanisław and Szczepan of Skwierczyn witnessed the deed. Other representatives of the family from Skwierczyn appear in the land registry documents of Drohiczyn midway through 15th century – they are: Piotr (1452), Stanisław (1454),Archiwum Państwowe w Lublinie, Archiwum Woronieckich z Huszlewa Wawrzyniec (1456), Mikołaj and Paweł (1458). In 1452 Piotr of Skwierczyn acted in the capacity of a witness to the heirs of Ugoszcz.Siedleckaja Uczebnaja Direkcja Furthermore, an historian Władysław Semkowicz writes about Banach of Skwierczyn in 1453. Next, in 1465 Paweł Skwierczyński acted as a witness for Wojciech of Mogilnica and in 1469 a statement was taken from witnesses of Paweł Skwierczyński: Raczek Koza and Andrzej Nasiłowski, who won compensation in court for the death of his nephew.Biblioteka PAN i PAU w Krakowie The latter also got in trouble with priest Wojciech, pastor of Wyrozęby, by supporting in 1476 the claims of priest Piotr, the vicar of Kożuchów. The misunderstandings arose most likely from the earlier accession of the village of Skwierczyn to the parish of Wyrozęby by way of decree granted by the bishop Marcin of Łuka. Later in 1481 Paweł Skwierczyński had a court case against Piotr, vicar of Wyrozęby.Archiwum Diecezjalne w Siedlcach, sygn. D 1 According to historian Tomasz Jaszczołt, in the years 1474–1484 mentions can be found of Jan Skwierczyński: Skwierczyński called Bujno, Jan, Wojciech and Paweł – brothers from Skwierczyn. We also know of Mikołaj Skwierczyński (1474). The judicial book of Drohiczyn for 1474–1484 mentions Mikołaj Skwierczyński as arbitrator for Błoński (1474), Paweł (1474) and Jan Skwierczyński, who had a court case against Andrzej Nasiłowski (1474), Maciej Sawicki (1482), and pledged some of his land in Kobylany to Jan Smoniewski (1484). In conjunction, nephews of Jan Skwierczyński: Bujno, Jan, Wojciech, Paweł are also mentioned.Archiwum Główne Akt Dawnych w Warszawie, Księga sądowa drohicka z l. 1474–1484 The judicial book of Drohiczyn for 1456–1595 includes entries about: Wawrzyniec of Skwierczyn (1456), Paweł of Skwierczyn, who pledged half of his heritage to Wit and Stanisław of Orlice in 1458, and later that year was a witness for the Wąż family. Also in 1458 the widow of Jakub of Kobylany sued Mikołaj of Skwierczyn for killing her husband but failed to bring witnesses and subsequently lost the court case. In 1485 Bartosz of Skwierczyn deferred the hearing with Bartosz and Klemens Wilk upon the request of Mikołaj Kobyleński. In 1485 brothers Bujno, Wojciech, Paweł and Jan Skwierczyński pledged 18 hectares in Kobylany to Jan Smoniewski, when Wilk Skwierczyński and Klemens Olędzki paid Mikołaj Kobyleński for their absence in court hearing . In the same year Jan Skwierczyński pledged a field to Wojciech Skorupka.Archiwum w Mińsku na Białorusi, Księga sądowa drohicka z l. 1456–1595 ‘Księga grodzka drohicka, s.II, nr 1 (1473–1484)’ – a judicial book – also includes numerous entries about the Skwierczyński family of Skwierczyn.Księga grodzka drohicka, s.II, nr 1 (1473–1484) Towards end of 15th century Marcin Wąsowski took ownership of the majority of Skwierczyn Ruski.

The szlachta (nobles) of Drohiczyn were pledging their allegiance on 14 May 1569. Skwierczyn was represented by szlachta (nobles): Stanisław son of Wojciech, Jan son of Tomasz, Mikołaj, Jan, Maciej sons of Szczęsny, as well as 2 others whose names are unknown. Skwirczyn Lacki was represented by szlachta/heirs: Malcher son of Mikołaj, Maciej, Mikołaj sons of Wojciech, Maciej, Bartłomiej sons of Paweł, Florian son of Walenty, Maciej, Paweł, Wojciech sons of Jan, Stanisław son of Andrzej, Stanisław son of Piotr, Aleksy son of Paweł, Antoni son of Jan, Andrzej, Piotr, Wojciech, Szczęsny sons of Stanisław, Stanisław, Antoni sons of Wojciech.

The alternative spellings of the surnames are mentioned alongside surnames: Lisiecki of Lis (Skwirczyński) and Koryciński of Topór (Śkwirczyński). The Skwierczyński family spread from Podlasie relatively late and primarily towards the South. In 1699 we can find a mention of Johannes Skwierczyński, a notary to the council of the Bishop of Przemyśl.‘Akta grodzkie i ziemskie z czasów Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej’ Tom VIII, Lwów 1880 str. 257, spis tresci na str. 325 In 1782 Antoni, Wincenty and Wojciech Skwirczyński provided evidence of their nobility to the sejm in Terebovlia as part of the legitimization of szlachta in the Austrian partition also known as Galicja.‘Poczet szlachty galicyjskiej i bukowińskiej’, Agenor Gołuchowski, Lwów 1857‘Polska Encyklopedia Szlachecka’ Tom VIII, Dr. fil.

Franciszek had issue of eight children, amongst whom: Franciszek Ksawery (born 1834 in Mielec died 1883 in Przemyśl) started the family branch that lived in and around Lwów, whereas Konstanty Jan (1815–1891) founded the Kraków branch of the family. Both family branches had a few officials in the 19th century Galicja, specifically – Kraków branch: Konstanty was an official at the Criminal Court of Rzeszów in 1838, and so was his brother Kazimierz, who later was promoted to the position of director in Kraków and acted on numerous occasions as witness in cases relating to the Galician slaughter (massacre of Polish nobles by peasants of Galicja) led by Jakub Szela in 1846.‘Historya rzezi 1846 r.’ Dr Adam Bogusz, Kraków 1902 r. ‘Szematyzm Królestwa Galicyi i Lodomeryi z Wielkim Księstwem Krakowskim na rok 1844’ Lwów Konstanty's sons: Mieczysław (1849–1933) and Kazimierz (1846–1914) both were also officials.Wielka Księga Adresowa zawierająca adresy m.

It is associated with structuralism and post-structuralism. Explanation Textuality is not just about the written word; it also comprises the placement of the words and the reader’s interpretation. There is not a set formula to describe a text’s textuality; it is not a simple procedure. This summary is true even though the interpretation that a reader develops from that text may decide the identity and the definitive meanings of that text. Textuality, as a literary theory, is that which constitutes a text in a particular way. The text is an indecidable (there is an inexistence of an effective or \\"strict\\" method of writing or structure). Aspects Being textual includes innumerable elements and aspects. Each and every form of text and text in that form of literature embraces and consists of its own individual and personal characteristics; these may include its personality, the individuality of that personality, the popularity, and so on. The textualities of the text define its characteristics. However, the characteristics are also closely associated with the structure of the text (Structuralism). Peter Barry's discussion of textuality notes that \\"its essence is the belief that things cannot be understood in isolation – they have to be seen in the context of the larger structures they are part of\\".Barry, Peter, Beginning Theory: An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory, 3rd ed., Manchester University Press, 2002. To form an opinion, criticise, or completely interpret a text one would first have to read the complete literary work as a whole; this enables the reader to make supported judgements on the personality and individuality of the text. The text is always hiding something. Although the reading may define and the interpretation may decide, the text does not define or decide. The text rests as operationally and fundamentally indecidable. Roger Webster frequently uses metaphors of ‘weaving’, ‘tissue’, ‘texture’, ‘strands’, and ‘filiation’ when talking about the structure of texts.Webster, Roger, Studying Literary Theory: An Introduction, 2nd ed. St.Martin's Press, 1996. He also agrees that \\"instead, the text is a surface over which the reader can range in any number of ways that the text permits.\\" Textuality is a practice. Through a text’s textuality, it makes itself mean, makes itself be, and makes itself come about in a particular way. Through its textuality, the text relinquishes its status as identity and affirms its condition as pure difference. In indifference, the text \\"dedefines\\" itself, etches itself in a texture or network of meaning, which is not limited to the text itself. Barry describes this as a \\"structuralist approach to literature, there is a constant movement away from the interpretation of the individual literary work and a parallel drive towards understanding the larger, abstract structures which contain them\\". A different view of textuality has been put forward by Rein Raud, according to whom textualities are \\"ordered sets of texts of different status that are related to each other and come with pre-arranged modes of interpretation\\". A textuality consists of base-texts, \\"those that define a textual community and form a part of the necessary cultural competence of its members\\", result- texts, \\"bids that have just been accepted and entered circulation, as well as those that have done so some time ago but are still being considered recent arrivals by their recipients\\", mediated by an operational memory, \\"a shared (and internally contradictory) mental space of the cultural community and its various subgroups where texts are produced and processed\\", which contains different kinds of knowledge, standards and codes shared to different extent by the carriers of the culture. According to Raud, this model is complementary to a model of cultural practices, in which the production, distribution and transmission of meaning is regarded in the context of individual participation and activity, while a textuality is necessarily shared and perceived by its carriers to be an objective, albeit constructed, reality. Concept of \\"text\\" The word text arose within structuralism as a replacement for the older idea in literary criticism of the \\"work\\", which is always complete and deliberately authored.Greene, Roland, ed.-in-chief, The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics, Princeton University Press, 2012. A text must necessarily be thought of as incomplete, indeed as missing something crucial that provides the mechanics of understanding. The text is always partially hidden; one word for the hidden part in literary theory is the subtext. The concept of the text in structuralism requires a relatively simple relationship between language and writing. Jacques Derrida, a leading post-structuralist, questions this relationship, aiming his critique primarily at Ferdinand de Saussure, who, he claims, does not recognize in the relationship between speech and writing \\"more than a narrow and derivative function\\".Derrida, Jacques, De la Grammatologie, translated as Of Grammatology by Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak,1976 corrected edition, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998. For Derrida, this approach requires putting too much emphasis on speech: :\\"Saussure confronts the system of the spoken language with the system of phonetic (and even alphabetic) writing as though with the telos (purpose) of writing.\\" Summation Barry says that \\"one of structuralism's characteristic views is the notion that language doesn’t just reflect or record the world: rather, it shapes it, so that how we see is what we see\\". This is closely linked to \\"post-structuralism\\" which is in fact, closely linked also to textuality. And Barry believes that the \\"post-structuralist maintains that the consequences of this belief are that we enter a universe of radical uncertainty…\\". Derrida further states: :\\"This teleology leads to the interpretation of all eruptions of the nonphonetic within writing as transitory crises and accidents of passage, and it is right to consider this teleology to be a Western ethnocentrism, a premathematical primitivism, and a preformalist intuitionism.\\" In short, textuality is an individual and uncertain skill that will always be read and interpreted in texts in different ways, by different people, and at different times. It is a literary tool that can never be defined like an exact science and that will always be influenced by the writer's life, such as, their upbringing, education, culture, age, religion, gender, and multiple other persuading factors. In the media Textuality can be seen, heard, read, and interacted with. Each of the three forms of medium – oral, print, and electronic – has a different form of textuality that reflects the way the sensory modalities are stimulated. * An example of textuality in the oral medium is the sound itself. * An example of textuality in the print medium is the physicality of a book. * An example of textuality in the electronic medium is the interactivity of a website, or visual of a specific television show.

The site, atop Kijō Mountain in what is today the Okayama Prefecture town of Sōja, is considered a national monument. Portions of the castle were reconstructed in the early 2000s. The castle's name literally means \\"demon castle\\" (ki is another reading for the character for oni); according to a traditional fable, a demon named Onra or Ura once ruled Kibi Province from the castle. Legend The castle is the basis of the myth that is associated with the folklore hero, Momotarō. The legendary story of Kibitsuhiko-no-mikoto and Ura explains that the Prince Ura of Kudara used to live in Kinojo (castle of the devil) and was a cause of trouble for the people living in the village. The emperor's government sent Kibitsuhiko-no- mikoto (Momotarō) to defeat Ura. History Following the defeat of Yamato Japan in the 663 battle of Hakusukinoe by an alliance of Tang China and the Korean kingdom of Silla, Emperor Tenji ordered the construction of defenses against a possible invasion. According to the Nihonshoki, twelve Korean-style mountain fortifications were built in western Japan at this time, and it is believed that Ki castle was one of them. The identification of particular sites with the fortresses constructed at this time remains a subject of debate, and most fortifications of this period are classified under the wider term kōgoishi (神籠石). The fortress was built atop Kijōyama (鬼城山, lit. Ki castle mountain), and used the topography and natural features as its primary defenses. Its elevation granted it the tactical high ground, and the trees and other foliage, not cleared entirely, provided additional obstacles to attackers. Simple stone walls and earthworks 2.8 km in perimeter surrounded the site. There were four gates pointing arranged to the cardinal directions, and a fifth, so-called \\"water gate,\\" through which water could be drained out of the fort. Within the fortress, the remains of a number of buildings have been found, including a smoke tower, well, and food storehouse. The site was formally examined by government officials in 1999, and permission was granted to begin research and reconstruction. Excavation and restoration has been carried out since then, though care has been taken to protect the natural environment in and around the site.

The film stars Tom Courtenay, Colin Blakely and Sam Wanamaker. Plot summary The film, set in 1972, was inspired by an actual incident which occurred on 17 January 1966: a B-52G Stratofortress collided with a KC-135 Stratotanker over Palomares, Spain, and four B-28 FI 1.45-megaton-range hydrogen bombs aboard the B-52 were briefly lost. In a title sequence shot by Maurice Binder, a chorus of Spanish Flamenco dancers explains why the film's location is Greece rather than Spain. Life on the remote Greek resort island of Karos is forever changed when atomic bombs are dropped there by a NATO plane rapidly losing power. Life on the island is so bleak that the inhabitants stage a mass exodus on news that Denmark has opened Greenland to Greek emigration. The pilots drop their payload – which includes two atomic weapons and a mysterious box called simply \\"Container Q\\" – over land, because they are under orders not to drop at sea. The hapless pilots parachute out and land safely on the island, but with no equipment or means to contact their headquarters, and they are left wearing only their underwear. Lacking resources – money to buy clothes, food, or even to pay for a long-distance call to base – the pilot and navigator of the lost bomber scour the island like vagabonds. Unknown to the pilots, the Americans have already deployed their own operation: a team of agents disguised as resort developers. The pilots are unaware of the fact that American agents are also on the island searching for their cargo. The island suddenly fills with clamoring, hedonistic tourists who believe the developer is going to build the best resort in the area first. Meanwhile, a poor goatherd and his wife find Container Q and, presuming it holds some treasure, they try to open it. Unsuccessful at first – because Container Q is virtually impregnable – the goatherd eventually steals a device that sprays acid that will eat through anything. Expecting gold, he and his wife instead find strange-looking rocks. The Americans are eventually led back to the panicked pair, but not before they throw Container Q into the sea, and the rocks into a cistern which provides the island's water. The contents of Container Q – presumably highly toxic – thus begins to contaminate all the water being consumed on the island. By nightfall, as tourists revel, the waters surrounding Karos become dotted with the bodies of dead and dying fish. The Americans sent to recover the lost payload of the stricken jet realize that they are too late. The pilot and the navigator, having begged enough small change from the tourists to call home, are shocked to be booted from the long-distance phone in the post office by the American developers. Too late, the pilots realize that the developers are American operatives. The revelers continue dancing wildly as a voice from a PA system pleads in vain for their attention, presumably to warn them of their imminent demise.

Finance was provided by 20th Century Fox who described it as \\"a satirical contemporary comedy with serious overtones\\". The original cast announced in June 1966 was Tom Courtney, James Fox, Colin Blakely and Elena Nathaniel. (Fox would ultimately drop out.) Cacoyannis was reportedly keeping the script secret and only showing the actors their parts. In July Candice Bergen joined the cast, in her third film. Bergen said the director cast her because he wanted an \\"arrogant type\\". Filming started 6 August 1966 in Greece. Bergen said filming was \\"heaven – the most fun I've had in ages.\\" Franc Roddam was an extra in the film. Reception The film was not a critical or commercial success. According to Fox records, the film needed to earn $1,350,000 in rentals to break even and made $1,590,000, meaning it made a loss.

Pickup locations included areas as far North as Troy; as far West as Trotwood, West Carrollton, and Miamisburg; areas East including Springfield, Yellow Springs, and Xenia; and as far South as Springboro / Franklin. An ownership change in January 2009 ushered-in an editorial narrowing from its broad “weekly news and culture” format while simultaneously distancing itself from the typical tabloid alternative newsweekly editorial format by aiming at hyper-local arts, culture, and entertainment coverage. The DCP cherry-picked editorial covering the region's performing and visual arts, cultural diversity, entertainment offerings (occasionally including Cincinnati and Columbus), nightlife, recreation, dining, beer, wine, festivals, and a blend of political debate and opinion. That focus along with other aggressive changes in 2010 such as moving its street publication day from Wednesdays to Tuesdays, converting its presentation from 50% color / 50% black & white to an all-color publication printed on an even brighter paper stock, and aggressively increasing its regional availability footprint by securing at least twenty-five regional Kroger stores along with other key pickup locations such as the Dayton Airport and the entire University of Dayton campus, the paper propelled its readership from just under 30,000 weekly readers to over 50,000 by 2017. Early readership surges quickly helped increase revenue sufficiently for employee-publisher Paul Noah to secure low-interest financing to form a new company Dayton City Media that purchased the Dayton City Paper in April, 2012. Other growth benefits included a rapid page-count increase from an average of 32 pages per week in 2009 to anywhere from 40 pages to 44 pages starting in 2013 naturally allowing the publication to expand editorial content in addition to its ability to increase critical display advertising (its only revenue source). At one time the paper swelled to 52 pages. The Dayton City Paper’s contributor roster climbed to its peak of over thirty freelance writers, as did its distribution pickup location count from approximately 350 to over 500 locations by 2016. Prior to 2003, the Dayton City Paper was known by two other monikers. The publication launched on August 26, 1993 under the name The Dayton Voice by the husband / wife team of Jeff Epton and Marrianne McMullen. In the early 2000s, the paper's name was changed to Impact Weekly as a result of legal pressure levied by the nationally known alternative newsweekly, The Village Voice which did the same to numerous weekly publications that included the word “Voice” in their names. A handshake agreement amongst many former “Voice” named publications yielded several new, but unrelated “City Paper” publications nationally including Philadelphia, PA, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, MD, and Toledo, OH. On April 3, 2003, Impact Weekly became Dayton City Paper. Whereas many alternative newsweeklies across the country tend to take political sides (typically left-leaning) and emphasize a blend of lifestyles, the Dayton City Paper deliberately departed from the alt-weekly stereotype with its politically-neutral arts and culture, etc. mission while still inclusively covering the myriad of lifestyles throughout the region, especially with respect to local and independent music coverage. In addition to over 80% locally written content, the publication featured a carefully selected roster of quality syndicated content well appreciated by its eclectic and educated audience including Amy Alkon's \\"The Advice Goddess\\", Chuck Shepard's \\"News of the Weird,\\" Cariel's \\"Sign Language Astrology,\\" the New York Times Sunday Crossword, as well as weekly editorial cartoons including Don Asmussen's \\"Bad Reporter,\\" Donna Barstow's \\"Daily Special,\\" and political satire by Ted Rall (raised in Kettering, Ohio). The paper's staff and freelance writers authoritatively delivered the editorial quality its readers demanded. Readers especially enjoyed the DCP's weekly locally-driven \\"debate forum\\" created by former Impact Weekly publisher Kerry Farley where opposing writers argued in a true debate format in favor or against political and social issues of the day with emphasis on local. Yet, debate topics nearly never included the typical water cooler conversation topics such as presidents, abortion, guns, and God. The only topics the paper ever took sides on were legalization of same-sex marriage, marijuana legalization, and solidarity with the French publication Charlie Hebdo. In fact, on April 25, 2015, the official website of the Dayton City Paper was hacked by unknown individual or individuals claiming to be affiliated with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). The DCP's website homepage instead played foreign music, displayed picture of a masked man holding an apparent assault rifle and displayed the message \\"Hacked by Team System DZ. I am Muslim & I love Jihad. I love ISIS <3.\\"\\" The paper's publisher, Paul Noah, stated in an interview on a local TV station he believed the hacking may have been related to the paper's January 20, 2015 edition where the Dayton City Paper executive team collectively chose to publish an approximation via illustrated parody the cover of the January 14 issue of Charlie Hebdo following the Charlie Hebdo shooting. The Dayton City Paper published its final issue on September 11, 2018, with the next issue unexpectedly not appearing on the next scheduled publication date of September 18. The next day, it was reported by several of the paper's writers that the paper had ceased publication, and the same day the newspaper's official website transitioned to provide only an archive of the virtual edition versions of past issues. The next week several local news media sources revealed that one the newspaper's employees, Wanda Esken, to whom Noah as CEO of Dayton City Media had entrusted daily operations by promoting her to the role of associate publisher and, finally, as Dayton City Paper publisher in September, 2017, had been indicted on charges of grand theft and forgery in relation to her activities in the company. In early January 2018 Noah contacted police after being told by the company that printed the Dayton City Paper that Dayton City Media owed about $35,000 in unpaid invoices. Shortly afterward, he learned from the Victoria Theatre Association (the DCP's landlord) that the publication was four months behind on rent as well. Until those and other unexpected revelations, Noah was under the belief the company was not being managed in arrears. The resulting investigation by the City of Dayton Police Department over the next several months became the basis behind the Montgomery County Prosecutor's indictment. Though the Dayton City Paper was able to remain afloat for over another half year with Noah contributing thousands of dollars of his own savings, yet leaving no public hint the paper was in trouble other than the page count had plummeted back down to an average of thirty-two to thirty-six pages per week by mid-Spring 2018, he was ultimately unable to prevent it from shutting down. He stated prior to the scandal the paper was thriving, with plans to expand into other markets such as Lexington, Kentucky. After confirming the Dayton Metro Library possessed at least one hard copy of every edition since its 1993 Dayton Voice launch, Noah promises to maintain DaytonCityPaper.com as an online archive of all virtual editions since August 4, 2010 as a courtesy to the paper's writers, advertisers, and readers. Wanda Esken was eventually arrested on February 4, 2019 based on three Fourth Degree Felony - Grand Theft charges and one Fifth Degree Felony - Forgery charge (all pending). Her trial, State of Ohio v. Wanda Esken, is scheduled for late July, 2019 in Montgomery County, Ohio Common Please Court in Dayton.

History  Pyzdry was first mentioned in 1232, when army of Silesian Piast Duke Henry I the Bearded entered Greater Poland. Pyzdry is one of the oldest town of the province, as in 1257 it was mentioned as a location governed by a vogt, which means that a well- established urban center must have already existed here. It is not known when Pyzdry received Magdeburg rights; most likely it happened during the reign of Duke Bolesław the Pious. On June 29, 1318 Wladyslaw Lokietek called at Pyzdry a meeting of Polish nobility and bishops, during which it was agreed that a delegation be sent to Pope John XXII, asking for his permission to grant Polish Crown to Lokietek. In 1331, Pyzdry was burned to the ground by the Teutonic Knights in the Battle of Pyzdry. Following the destruction, King Kazimierz Wielki ordered construction of a defensive wall with a mighty castle. In 1345, a truce between Kazimierz Wielki and John of Bohemia was signed here. On June 6, 1346, Kazimierz Wielki presented at Pyzdry legal statutes for the province of Greater Poland. In 1390, King Wladyslaw Jagiello met here with Wartislaw VII, Duke of Pomerania, who pledged vassalage to king of Poland. In 1562, Pyzdry was named as the location of gatherings of pospolite ruszenie for Kalisz Voivodeship. The town was in 1655 captured and looted by Swedish soldiers (see Swedish invasion of Poland), and in 1704, a battle between supporters of Stanislaw Leszczyński and August II took place here. In 1768, Pyzdry burned in a great fire. Following the second partition of Poland, Pyzdry was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia (1793). In 1815, it became part of Russian-controlled Congress Poland, in which it remained until World War I, and was the westernmost point of the Russian Empire. In 1818, Pyzdry County was disbanded, and in 1867, Russians reduced Pyzdry to the status of a village, which lasted until 1919. The town has several points of interest: * historic urban center, which was shaped in the 14th century, * parish church (built in mid-14th century, remodelled in the 15th century and in 1865–1870), * Franciscan abbey (14th century), * Baroque monastery (1690), located on the Warta river, * ruins of a castle and defensive wall (early 14th century), * houses from 18th and 19th centuries, Among people born here are Mikolaj of Pyzdry (rector of Jagiellonian University), writer Stefan Otwinowski and film director Ewa Petelska.

It was mentioned in documents from 1289. Kobylin was granted town rights before 1303. Initially, it was called Wenecja. In 1456 a school was established at the Bernardine monastery. Its graduates usually enrolled to the University of Kraków, Poland's oldest and leading university. Among them were professors of the University of Kraków: Maciej of Kobylin, who was a philosopher and one of the teachers of Nicolaus Copernicus, Piotr of Kobylin, author of the first known Polish textbook, and , translator of the first anatomical book published in the Polish language. During the Thirty Years' War, Protestant refugees from Silesia settled in the town. After the Second Partition of Poland, in 1793 it was annexed by Prussia. Regained by Poles in 1807, it was included in the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, in 1815 it was re-annexed by Prussia.

It was in use between 1850 and 1873. The gallery was built in the 1820s by the architect John Nash as part of his own house, to display his considerable collection of paintings. In 1850 the building was named the Gallery of Illustration, and between then and 1855 it housed a diorama created and run by the theatrical scene-painters Thomas Grieve and William Telbin. From 1856 to 1873 the gallery was in the hands of the singer and actress Priscilla Horton and her husband German Reed. Their entertainments developed from songs and comedy with piano accompaniment to programmes of short plays and operettas. In deference to respectable mid-Victorian doubts about the propriety of theatres, the Reeds called their productions \\"entertainments\\", and avoided the use of the words \\"theatre\\", \\"play\\" and other theatrical terms. Under the Reeds the gallery played an important part in the development of a new generation of authors, composers and performers. Among the writers whose works the Reeds staged staged were W. S. Gilbert and F. C. Burnand, and their composers included Arthur Sullivan, Frederic Clay and Alfred Cellier. The performers Arthur Cecil, Corney Grain and Fanny Holland made their names at the gallery early in their careers. The lease of the building expired in 1873, and it ceased to be used as a performance venue. The Reeds moved to another theatre, and the gallery became a banqueting hall. History =1824–1855= Nash's original gallery The gallery was built by the architect John Nash, designer of Regent Street, Regent's Park, and other urban improvements undertaken to the commission of King George IV. The gallery was part of Nash's own residence at 14 Regent Street, completed in 1824. It originally housed copies of paintings by Raphael in the Vatican, which Nash arranged, with papal permission, to be copied by top Roman artists of the time.Wheatley, p. 159 He allowed members of the public to view the gallery by appointment.Summerson, pp. 212–213 After his death the pictures were sold. The house was bought by an auctioneer called Rainy, who made it his business premises and used the gallery to display his wares in the 1830s and 1840s.\\"Sir W. Forbes's Pictures\\", The Morning Post, 1 June 1842, p. 6 In 1850 the theatrical scene- painters Thomas Grieve and William Telbin took on the lease of the building. They opened it in March as the Gallery of Illustration, offering a diorama display with expert commentary and music.\\"Diorama of the Overland Route to India\\", The Times, 26 March 1850, p. 5 The first show, \\"Diorama of the Overland Route to India\\", opened in March 1850 and was a success with critics and public. A reviewer wrote: The Morning Chronicle reported in October that the show \\"continues to attract overflowing audiences to the Gallery of Illustration in Regent-street. Its extensive popularity, however, is no matter for wonder, as the subject treated is perhaps the finest that can be conceived for the purposes of scenic illustration\\".\\"The Great Exhibition of 1851\\", The Morning Chronicle, 21 October 1850, p. 4 Grieve and Telbin followed this with \\"Diorama of Our Native Land\\" (1851),\\"Gallery of Illustration, Regent-Street\\", The Standard, 21 January 1851, p. 3 \\"Campaigns of the Duke of Wellington\\" (1852),\\"Gallery of Illustration\\", The Morning Post, 27 April 1852, p. 5 \\"Diorama of the Arctic Regions\\" (1853),\\"Gallery of Illustration\\", The Standard, 24 December 1853, p. 2 and \\"The Seat of War\\" (1854).\\"Royal Gallery of Illustration\\", The Morning Post, 25 July 1854, p. 6 The prefix \\"Royal\\" was added to the title of the establishment by late 1852, but it is not clear on what authority, if any.\\"Royal Gallery of Illustration\\", The Morning Post, 12 October 1852, p. 5 =1856–1873= The Reeds: Priscilla Horton and German Reed Early in 1856 the singer and actress Priscilla Horton began to perform at the venue. Her entertainments given at St Martin's Hall had been popular, and with her husband, German Reed, at the piano and \\"the pictorial aid of Messrs Grieve and Telbin\\", she started giving what The Morning Chronicle called \\"her very clever impersonations\\" at the Royal Gallery of Illustration.\\"Miss P. Horton\\", The Morning Chronicle, 26 January 1856, p. 5 The Reeds continued to perform at the gallery for seventeen years, in what were first billed as \\"Miss P. Horton's Illustrative Gatherings\\" and then \\"Mr and Mrs German Reed's Entertainments\\". They quickly became public favourites: in 1859 The Daily News observed: In 1860 the Reeds were joined by John Parry, a former concert singer and subsequently an entertainer known for his impressions of popular performers. The historian Jane W. Stedman writes that the Reeds' playbills \\"settled into a format, which continued even after Parry retired in 1869: a musical monologue to piano accompaniment by Parry ... preceded and/or followed by a musical piece, later two, often farcical, often a pocket operetta\\". A Peculiar Family, 1855 In the 1850s and 1860s theatres were regarded by a substantial part of society as not respectable. The historian Andrew Crowther writes, \\"Many who would gladly attend a concert, a lecture or an exhibition at a gallery would not think of setting foot in a theatre\\".Crowther, p. 82 The Reeds did not to refer to the Gallery of Illustration as a theatre, and they called their productions \\"illustrations\\" or \\"entertainments\\", acts were \\"parts\\", and roles were \\"assumptions\\", avoiding conventional theatrical terms. Stedman comments that the accompaniment of piano, harmonium, and at times a harp \\"also emphasized the presumably untheatrical nature of the entertainment\\". The author F. Anstey recalled that in his Victorian childhood there was no question of being taken to a theatre, The stage was tiny because the long, narrow gallery could not accommodate a larger one. This restricted the Reeds to a cast of at most five performers. Much doubling of parts and quick changes were called for. The Era reported on a typical production in July 1868: Ages Ago by W. S. Gilbert and Frederic Clay (1869), the gallery's most popular show Reed experimented with what he called chamber opera – opera di camera – simplified versions of operas for his usual small forces. The first was Jessy Lea (1863), a retelling of L'elisir d'amore, with words by John Oxenford and music by George Macfarren.Jacobs, Arthur. \\"Cradled among the Reeds: Two Victorian Operettas\\", The Musical Times, May 1988, pp. 234–235 After seven further productions of the same nature, with original music by Macfarren and Virginia Gabriel and adaptations of Offenbach and Michael Balfe the experiment came to an end.Grove, p. 91 At the gallery the Reeds staged nine pieces by William Brough, seven by F. C. Burnand, and five by W. S. Gilbert, whose Ages Ago (1869, with music by Frederic Clay) was the Reeds' longest-running and most frequently revived production, narrowly outdistancing Burnand and Arthur Sullivan's Cox and Box. Other authors whose works were presented there included Shirley Brooks, Henry Chorley, James Planché, Robert Reece, T. W. Robertson, Bolton Rowe and Tom Taylor. Among the composers in addition to Reed, Parry, Macfarren, Sullivan, Gabriel and Clay were Alfred Cellier and James Molloy. The Reeds' lease of the gallery expired at the end of July 1873, and the building ceased to be used as a performance space. The programme for the last night there, on 31 July, comprised Mildred's Well; or A Romance of the Middle Ages by Burnand and Reed, Very Catching by Burnand and Molloy, and Our Garden Party by Corney Grain.\\"The London Theatres\\", The Era, 3 August 1873, p. 11 The Reeds moved to St George's Hall at the opposite end of Regent Street; the gallery became the banqueting hall of the Pall Mall Restaurant, which occupied the site until 1883, when the building was leased by the new Constitutional Club.\\"The Pall Mall\\", The Morning Post, 1 March 1875, p. 6; Lubenow, p. 106; and \\"Our London Correspondence\\", The Liverpool Mercury, 11 May 1883, p. 5 Legacy The historical importance of the gallery is chiefly its role in the early careers and development of leading authors, composers and performers. Several future stars had their start in the Reeds' company, including Arthur Cecil, Corney Grain and Fanny Holland. Few of the shows presented at the gallery have remained in the repertory. Gilbert's Ages Ago has been revived occasionally. Burnand and Sullivan's Cox and Box was taken up by later managements including the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company,Rollins and Witts, p. 2 and has continued to be revived regularly in the 21st century.Hutchinson, Charles. \\"Harrogate plays host to 40 performances at International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival from Wednesday\\", York Press, 1 August 2016.

He also served as a Justice of the Peace.Who was Who, OUP 2007 =Parliament= Alstead unsuccessfully contested the Wigan parliamentary constituency at the 1918 general election. He next contested Altrincham in Cheshire at the 1922 general election. The Liberals had not contested Altrincham at the previous election in 1918 when a Labour candidate challenged the sitting Unionist. Despite this disadvantage, Alstead was easily able to push the Labour candidate into third place; Another General Election took place a year later, fought on the issue of Free trade v Protectionism. Across the country there was a swing away from the Unionists and in Altrincham this helped Alstead, as the only challenger, to take the seat. He was the first Liberal to win Altrincham since January 1910. With only a Labour minority government in office, another General Election was called a year later. With the Unionists regaining ground across the country, Alstead was defeated at Altrincham. After 4 years of Unionist majority government which included a General Strike, the Liberal Party, now led by David Lloyd George, were challenging strongly again and Alstead had hopes of regaining Altrincham. However, this time, Alstead faced a Labour candidate as well as a Unionist, making winning the seat too difficult. He did not contest the 1931 general election, when Atkinson was returned unopposed as a supporter of the National Government. Alstead did not stand for Parliament again, although he was prospective Liberal candidate for Preston in 1934–1935, but pulled out the month before the 1935 election.The Times, 25 October 1935, p16 Honours He received the Order of the British Empire in the 1939 New Year's Honours List.http://www.wiganworld.co.uk/stuff/chronology10.php?opt=chrono&yr;=1939 Death Alstead died at Gathurst, near Wigan, on 9 September 1946, aged 72 years.

It is also the seat of the administrative district (gmina) called Gmina Pobiedziska. The town's name comes from the word pobieda meaning victory. It was named by Casimir I the Restorer in 1048 AD, possibly to commemorate his defeat of Masław, a rebellious Masovian namiestnik. Official website of Pobiedziska - History of the town and region In 1257, Pobiedziska was granted town privileges by Przemysł I of Greater Poland, making the town independent from the Ostrów Lednicki castellany. In 1331, the town was destroyed by the Teutonic Knights and it took many years to recover. The town was often visited by Władysław Jagiełło. In 1423 he funded the construction of a Church of the Holy Spirit as well as a hospital for the poor. Due to the partitions of Poland, the town fell under German control in the late 18th century. On December 29, 1918, the inhabitants of Pobiedziska took control of the town from German officials and disarmed the police and settlers. On January 4, 1919, Poles from Pobiedziska formed a 400-strong battalion which fought in the Greater Poland Uprising (1918–1919), including the battle for Inowrocław.

Residential buildings, characteristic of present-day town date from the close of the 19th century. The railway line leading to Wroclaw and station building were built in 1856. In the Interwar period the excursion traffic on Sundays and holidays was so great that trains from Poznań ran every 10 minutes. To avoid interference with the long-distance traffic an additional track had to be built for them. Also popular were steamboat trips. In the 1950s the steamboat, \\"Janek Krasicki\\", in later years, motorboat \\"Dziwożona\\" cruised from Poznań to Puszczykowo. The chief of the city between 1968–84 was Wladyslaw Krzyżański.

Mission statement The Skateboard Mag's mission statement stated that it In a February 2005 interview, the magazine's three primary founders, Brittain, Swift, and Mihaly explained the ethos of the magazine and the main points of distinction from their former employer by stating that the target audience is \\"hardcore skateboarders\\", while Transworld retains a tendency towards the mainstream aspect of skateboarding culture. Mihaly explained: \\"We don't have any beef with those guys. We've been doing what we're doing for a year and realized we can all coexist. The further we can separate the umbilical chord from them the better.\\" Digital photography The launch of The Skateboard Mag coincided with the popularization of digital photography in skateboarding and Atiba Jefferson has revealed that he made the shift upon his commencement at the publication: > You know, it's really funny, because, at Transworld I did my film, Cross- > Process, you know, it was really funny, because right when The Skateboard > Mag came is when digital photography came ... right when that magazine > started is right when I almost switched over to a 100 percent digital.

Biography Birkbeck was born in 1838 and served as Conservative MP for North Norfolk from 1879 (being returned at a by- election following the death of Colonel Duff) to 1885 and for East Norfolk from 1885 to 1892. He was defeated in the 1892 general election by Sir Robert Price. He was created a baronet, of Horstead Hall, in the parish of Horstead, in the County of Norfolk on 9 March 1886. The baronetage became extinct in 1908 on his death. Birkbeck resided at Horstead Hall, a mansion located in extensive and secluded grounds outside Horstead, Norfolk, remodelled in the Tudor style in 1835. He entertained Lord Salisbury there on at least one occasion (1887), and bred Jersey cattle there. Sir Edward greatly improved the farm buildings, adding, among other things, a watertower in the Italian style that remains a local landmark, cottages and one of the two lodges facing towards Buxton. Sir Edward served as, among other things, President of the National Sea Fisheries Protection Association, and Chairman of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. In June 1902 he was on board German torpedo boat S. 42 when it sank off Cuxhaven, after it was accidentally run over by the steam ship SS Frisby. Sir Edward had been granted passage in the torpedo boat from Heligoland to Cuxhaven, returning from the Dover to Heligoland yacht race, and survived unharmed, though the captain and several German crew members drowned. Sir Edward Birkbeck died on 2 September 1908. The Horstead Hall estate passed to a collateral branch of the family. His wife survived him. A branch of the family still resides in the area, at Rippon Hall, a mansion in much the same style between Buxton and Reepham.

It lies approximately north of the major city of Poznań, on the main road and railway line to Wągrowiec. The Trojanka stream flows through northern and western parts of the town, reaching the river Warta a few kilometres to the west. The town is divided into two main parts – the older part of the town to the north, centred on the market square and St. James' church, and the modern estate of Zielone Wzgórza to the south, consisting mainly of blocks of flats and houses built since 1983. Murowana Goślina is also the seat of the municipality called Gmina Murowana Goślina, which has a total population of 15,713 (2007) and covers an area of . The area around Murowana Goślina contains many lakes and forest areas, particularly within the protected area called Puszcza Zielonka Landscape Park. The region is popular with holiday-makers and day-trippers. Name In mediaeval times the settlement was called Górka (meaning \\"hill\\") – this name appears in chronicles from the reigns of Mieszko I and Bolesław the Brave in the late 10th and early 11th centuries. The later name Goślina was derived from the personal name Gostl (related to Polish gość, \\"guest\\"), which referred to a warrior from outside the region who was given the local estates as a reward for service to the state. When a church was built in the late 11th century, the place was referred to as Goślina Templi. Around 1200, outside the wooden palisade around the wooden church, the ruling family erected a granite tower as a residence. It was this that gave rise to the name Murowana Goślina (murowana meaning \\"brick-built\\"), first attested in 1355. In the 13th century a large area on the right bank of the Warta around the Trojanka (then called Wełnianka) belonged to the Gostl family, and Murowana Goślina developed along a new trading route leading northwards from Poznań to Nakło. In local colloquial speech the name of the town is normally shortened to just the prefix \\"Murowana\\". There is also a village called Długa Goślina (\\"Long Goślina\\") about to the north. Geography Murowana Goślina lies about north of the major city of Poznań, on the main road and railway line between Poznań and Wągrowiec. The Trojanka stream (formerly also called Goślinka, Wełnianka or Czarna Wełna) flows through northern and western parts of the town, flowing into the river Warta a few kilometres to the west. The municipal buildings, library and many shops are situated on or close to the old marketplace in the town centre, which also contains St. James' church (built 1605). However a large part of the town's population lives on the modern Zielone Wzgórza estate (with blocks of flats and houses built from 1983 onwards), which is located to the south of the old part of the town. Murowana Goślina is also the seat of a municipality (gmina), called Gmina Murowana Goślina, which has a total population of 15,713 (2007) and covers an area of . The area around Murowana Goślina contains many lakes and forest areas, including the Puszcza Zielonka forest, incorporated into the protected area called Puszcza Zielonka Landscape Park. The region is popular with holiday-makers and day-trippers, and there are a large number of summer vacation properties in the area. History =Early history= In the region around Murowana Goślina, there have been archeological finds dating from the Paleolithic (c. 8000 BC) and the Neolithic. In a triangle between Murowana Goślina, Długa Goślina and the Warta, early mediaeval treasure from the 10th and early 11th centuries have been found. The area lay on the ancient route from the early Polish capital Gniezno to western Pomerania via a crossing of the Warta at Radzim (near today's Starczanowo). It is not known when Murowana Goślina received town rights, although it must have occurred before 1389, in the reign of Władysław Jagiełło. In that year there is a reference to the wójt Andrzej of Górka, and in 1391 there is also mentioned a local resident called Staszek. The town took over the function of a castellany from Radzim. =17th and 18th centuries= Murowana Goślina was a privately owned town, and changed owners often. From 1593 it was owned by Jan Rozdrażewski, who granted privileges and a coat of arms – a blue shield with three rosettes on a silver diagonal stripe (an angel was added in the 18th century). In 1605 the old wooden church was replaced with a brick church with a single nave, built onto the two-storey rectangular tower. In 1651 the town was acquired by Jan Leszczyński, and his family held it until 1694. In 1724-1726 the priest, Filip Woliński, added a presbytery to the church in place of the earlier apse. The tower was by this time raised above the level of the church and contained bells. The town was struck by plague on many occasions, and was also devastated during the Swedish Wars. In the 18th century, under the Gurowski family, the town prospered and many craftsmen were settled there. In 1736 Melchior Gurowski founded the village of Hamer (today's Raduszyn, just west of the town), where iron, paper and oil were made and grain ground. There were also Dutch settlements (olendry) around existing villages. In 1752 a new street, Zamkowa (\\"Castle Street\\"; now ul. Kochanowskiego) was laid out in the town and a school was opened. In 1763 a potters' guild received rights and privileges. In 1782 Jews were allowed to live in the town. In 1785 king Stanisław August granted the town the right to hold fairs, and clothiers settled there. In 1793, with the Second Partition of Poland, the town came under Prussian rule. At that time it had a population of 903, with 99 houses. Most of the population was engaged in crafts and trade. The main street was paved, and on the Warta was a ferry belonging to the town owner. The town's name became Germanized as Murowana Goslin. Land and Town was owned by the barons von Winterfeld. =19th century= The old town hall building, now a library and museum In 1784–1803 a Protestant church was built near the north-east corner of the market square, with a German school close to it. A Polish school would be built in the first half of the 19th century on Zamkowa (Kochanowskiego), opposite a medical centre. Catholic and Protestant cemeteries came to exist on hills on opposite sides of the road leading south to Poznań (the Catholic cemetery, on the western side, is still functional, but the Protestant cemetery on the eastern side is in a ruined state). In 1807 Murowana Goślina became part of the powiat of Oborniki, within the Napoleonic Duchy of Warsaw. In 1815 the region returned to Prussia, as part of the Grand Duchy of Posen. A major fire of 1817 destroyed much of the town and led to many families moving elsewhere, although there were also new arrivals. Houses began to be built with adobe bricks, some of which can still be seen in the older buildings. In 1830 reconstruction of the parish church began. The tower was taken down and the nave extended, and a sacristy was added. Later a small tower was added on the presbytery roof and a free-standing bell-tower was built. A wall with two gates was built around the church. In 1841 the estate and town's lands were acquired by Hans Karol von Winterfeld. A mansion was built by the Winterfeld family in the town park (reconstructed in the second half of the century). The family existed there till 1945. In 1842 Murowana Goślina had 196 houses and 1554 residents. In the mid 19th century a fine town hall was built on the market square. A synagogue had been built in the early 19th century, in the Jewish quarter of the town to the north of the market square, along ul. Rogozińska (formerly Bydgoska); the synagogue was on ul. Żydowska (\\"Jewish Street\\"), now ul. Szkolna (\\"School Street\\"). The building was renovated following a major fire in 1847. It was also used as a school for Jewish children. There was also a Jewish cemetery to the south-west of the town, on the road to Mściszewo (on the hill on which the Middle School now stands). Both the synagogue and cemetery were later destroyed during the Nazi occupation. In the Spring of Nations events of 1848, a rebel force consisting of peasants and townsmen blocked communications with northern Greater Poland. The economy of the town developed in the second half of the century, thanks to its location on a route northwards from Poznań. Various institutions were formed, including a people's bank (Bank Ludowy) in 1873, a volunteer fire brigade in 1888, craft guilds which formed the Industrialists' Society (Towarzystwa Przemysłowców) in 1904, and an agricultural organization (Kółko Rolnicze) in 1905. A public library was also founded. A larger Polish school building was erected on ul. Szkolna in 1897. =20th century= The synagogue, destroyed under Nazi occupation In 1901 the town had a population of 1,513, of whom 982 were classed as Polish, 427 as German and 104 as Jewish. In 1905 the railway line to Poznań, passing through Murowana Goślina, was opened (by 1908 it extended northwards to Wągrowiec). A station was built, as well as a road bridge linking the town centre with settlements east of the railway, called Piła Wieś (the district of the town around ul. Wodna was called Piła Miasto, and the mansion – which before the First World War was used as a customs office – appeared on some postcards as Schloss Pila). The new railway was visited twice by German Emperor Wilhelm II. In 1902–1903, gas pipes were laid in the town, and in 1935 electricity was introduced. The gasworks was close to the junction of ul. Poznańska and ul. Wojska Polskiego (formerly ul. Półwiejska). Near to this was the imperial post office building (still standing). In 1907 the soldiers of the German imperial army appeared in the town and on the market square while carrying out manoeuvres in the Poznań area. The town's development was slowed by the First World War and the Greater Poland Uprising of 1918–1919, in which many inhabitants were involved. Rebuilding of the town in the post-war independent Poland was slow. Among organizations founded were the Concordia sports club in 1921, and a church choir in 1926. The town's population grew from 1,595 in 1921 to 2,482 in 1931 and 2,800 in 1933 (2,417 Poles, 337 Germans, 16 Jews). Many of the German population (including Jews) emigrated to Germany in the interwar years. Germans accounted for 14% of the population of the town in the 1930s, and the number of Jewish families had fallen from 18 to two by 1939. In September 1939, following the German invasion of Poland, a resistance squadron of 40 armed volunteers forced a German patrol to retreat and fired on German engineers repairing a bridge over the Warta. In the first months of the war, 14 citizens of Murowana Goślina were executed, and 85 were taken to concentration camps, of whom 54 did not return. Also 45 soldiers were killed in fighting, four people died in the Katyń massacre, and many families were displaced. =Since the Second World War= The town was liberated on 21 January 1945, and on 23 January a civic militia (Milicja Obywatelska) was formed. The retreating Germans burnt down the railway station, the interwar post office at the junction of ul. Rogozińska and ul. Młyńska, and the occupiers' administrative building (Amtskomissariat) on the north side of the market square. Also destroyed by the occupiers during the war were the wall around the church, the church bell-tower, and the figures of the Madonna and Child, St. John Nepomucen and St. Laurence. For the next 44 years the town would be part of the communist Polish People's Republic. Its population in 1945 was 2,482 (compared with 2,700 in 1939); this increased to 4,399 by 1975, and this figure would more than double in subsequent years, particularly due to the building of the Zielone Wzgórza estate. In 2009 the town's official population was 10,336.Polish Statistical Office (GUS) population data, accessed 11 December 2009 The Zielone Wzgórza (\\"green gables\\") estate to the south of the old town was built under the auspices of a housing cooperative set up originally to provide homes for employees of the Cegielski factory (later \\"Pressta\\") in Bolechowo, a short distance to the south. It was planned to provide housing for 6000 people, mainly in blocks of flats. The first buildings were begun in 1983 and completed in 1986, and a primary school on the estate was completed in 1988. A church was built starting in 1990 and completed in 1993, becoming the parish church of Jesus Christ the Highest Archchaplain (Najwyższego Arcykapłana Jezusa Chrystusa). Also in 1990 a public library was opened on the estate. With the factory experiencing financial difficulties, the housing cooperative separated from the company in 1992, under the name Spółdzielnia Mieszkaniowa \\"Zielone Wzgórza\\". Around the year 2000, groups of houses began to be built in addition to blocks. From 2006 the older blocks have been renovated, with thermal insulation added. In February 2006 the town council passed a resolution dividing the town into 12 districts (each called an osiedle), with elected executives having certain limited powers and budget.

The current Mayor is Marek Madej.  History  The oldest known mention Wysoka comes from 1260, when it was granted by Duke Bolesław the Pious from the Piast dynasty to Mikołaj Łodzia. Its name means \\"high\\" in Polish and refers to its elevation, as it is located at the Wysockie Hills. In the 15th century, there was already a Catholic church of St. Martin in the village.Słownik geograficzny Królestwa Polskiego i innych krajów słowiańskich, Tom XIV, Warszawa, 1895, p. 125 (in Polish) Wysoka was granted town rights in 1505. Also the town's coat of arms dates back to the 16th century. In the following centuries it was a private town owned by Polish nobility, particularly the Kościelski and Tuczyński families, located in the Kalisz Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. Baroque Church of Our Lady of the Rosary and the timber framed belfry in the 1970s In the late 17th century local noblewoman Apolonia Tuczyńska brought Augustinians to Wysoka. She later renewed Wysoka's town rights after a big fire in 1722, while in 1727-29 the Augustinians built a Baroque Church of Our Lady of the Rosary. During the First Partition of Poland, in 1772, Wysoka was annexed by Prussia. Regained by Poles as part of the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw in 1807, before it was re-annexed by Prussia in 1815. After 1818, under the Germanized name Wissek, it belonged to the Wirsitz county of the province of Posen. In 1846 the town suffered a fire. In January 1919 Wysoka was captured by Poles during Greater Poland uprising (1918–19), which aim was to reintegrate the town along with the region of Greater Poland with Poland, which just regained independence a few weeks earlier. Poles established the Polish People's Council (Polska Rada Ludowa) and the Civic Guard (Straż Obywatelska). However, later that same month, irregulars from Germany captured the town. A Polish counterattack from Wyrzysk failed. In 1919 a local branch of the \\"Sokół\\" Polish Gymnastic Society was founded.Czerwone szkoły. Przywracamy pamięć, Fundacja Nasze Podwórko, Gościejewo, 2018, p. 47 (in Polish) In January 1920 Wysoka was finally transferred from Weimar Germany to Poland following the Treaty of Versailles, and it was attached to the Wyrzysk Powiat (county). After the German invasion of Poland, which sparked World War II in September 1939, 19 Polish craftsmen and farmers were murdered by the Germans on the slope of the Góra Wysoka hill in two mass executions on October 21 and November 21.Maria Wardzyńska, Był rok 1939. Operacja niemieckiej policji bezpieczeństwa w Polsce. Intelligenzaktion, IPN, Warszawa, 2009, p. 164 (in Polish) Nowadays there is a memorial at the site. Local Poles were also murdered by the Germans in other places, for instance, the principal of the interwar Polish school, Franciszek Karowski, was murdered in Paterek in October 1939. The town was annexed into the \\"Regierungsbezirk Bromberg\\" of the Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia and governed by the Nazi Gauleiter Albert Forster. During the occupation of Poland the administration changed the name of the town to \\"Weißeck\\" (1942–1945). The German occupation ended in January 1945 and the town was restored to Poland. Between 1975–1998 the city administratively belonged to the Piła Voivodeship. Since 1999 the town has been part of the Greater Poland Voivodeship.  Economy  Wysoka is a small business centre, which serves the needs of the surrounding agricultural area. There is a small wood and brick factory. There was much economic development during the 19th century when the Prussian province of Posen was fully integrated into the wider Imperial German economy. Many Germans left after World War I and those who remained were expelled after World War II. A small gauge rail still serves the area. Sports Wysoka's football team is GLKS Wysoka, founded in 1949, and it competes in the regional lower leagues.

History The town's name is of Old Polish origin and comes from the word zagór. The oldest known mention of the settlement comes from a document from 1240. Zagórów received town rights from King Władysław II Jagiełło in 1407, however, these rights were implemented only in 1445. Administratively it was part of the Kalisz Voivodeship of the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. The town suffered as a result of the 17th-century Polish–Swedish wars. It was annexed by Prussia during the Second Partition of Poland in 1793. Regained by the Poles in 1807, as part of the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw, it passed to the Russian Partition of Poland in 1815. Polish insurgents were active in the area during the January Uprising in 1863, and a battle was fought in the nearby village of Myszaków. As part of Anti-Polish repressions after the fallen uprising, the tsarist administration stripped Zagórów of its town rights in 1869. Town rights were restored in 1919, after Poland regained independence. In the interbellum the local economy revived. During the German occupation of Poland (World War II), on November 21-22, 1939, 10 Polish inhabitants of Zagórów, former participants of the Polish Greater Poland uprising (1918–19), were murdered by the Germans in the forest in the nearby village of Grabina.Maria Wardzyńska, Był rok 1939. Operacja niemieckiej policji bezpieczeństwa w Polsce. Intelligenzaktion, IPN, Warszawa, 2009, p. 210 (in Polish) The Germans expelled some Poles to the so- called General Government. In 1940, the Germans forced Zagórów's 600 Jews into a ghetto ghetto and then resettled hundreds of Jews from other localities into the ghetto, without money, jobs, or places to live. Over 2000 Jews were now in the ghetto, 10 to 15 people per room. In 1941, some were sent to a forced labor camp in the salt mines near Inowroclaw. In late September 1941, all the Jews still in the ghetto were taken to the Kazimierz Biskupi Forst where they were murdered. Eyewitness testimonies document the horrific day where Germans were experimenting with mass killing methods. https://deportation.yadvashem.org/index.html?language=en&itemId;=12834211&ind;=7 Only a few Zagórów Jews survived the war.

In World War II, Tuliszków was home to one of the first Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland following the Nazi German and Soviet invasion of 1939. The ghetto was formed in December 1939 or January 1940\\\\. History The oldest mention of Tuliszków in 1320 originates from the Chronicle of Kacper Niesiecki, written three centuries later. Known in Latin as Tviliskow, Tuliscov, or Tuliscovo (meaning, fox grounds), it received town privileges in 1458 after the Battle of Grunwald. Featured in the Tuliszków coat-of-arms is the knight 'Janusz z Tuliszkowa' holding his Grunwald sword. The town grew substantially in the 19th century, although stripped of town privileges by the tsar in 1870 as revenge for the January Uprising against the Russian occupation. Much of the town was consumed by fire in 1881. The population of Tuliszków was approximately 2,000 in the beginning of the 20th century. Following Poland's return to independence the city rights were restored. In the Second Polish Republic the population grew to 2,600 before 1939. =Jewish community= The Jewish community was 250 people in the 1921 census, led by Rabbi Joel Foks, member of Mizrachi. The economic crisis of the 1930s forced some families to leave in search of a better life. Soon after the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, on October 8, 1939 the first ever ghetto of World War II was set up at Piotrków Trybunalski . After that ghettos were established in most communities in Poland. Jews were moved into the poorest parts of town and forced to live in squalor with multiple people occupying each room. There were only 230 Jews in Tuliszków at the onset of war, around 10% of the general population. In December 1939 the invading Germans ordered the creation of a Judenrat and forced all adult Jews to wear the Star of David; the community was stripped of money and valuables. Within weeks the ghetto was formed, and electricity was cut off from it in the dead of winter. Stronger Jews were pressed to forced labour. The ghetto was liquidated in October 1941 and all Jews – men, women and children – deported to transit ghetto in Kowale Pańskie. Some escaped from that ghetto and returned to Tuliszkow to hide. Others were sent to forced labor camps near Poznan or to Lodz. Most of those in the Kowale Pańskie ghetto were sent to Chełmno extermination camp. Only one Tuliszkow Jew is known to have survived the war.

So focused on drawing was Lewis that his mother, concerned for his social life, would invite his schoolmates over after school, hoping this would encourage Lewis to play. Lewis responded by sketching favourite cartoon characters for his delighted peers. By the age of 12, Lewis had amassed dozens of sketchbooks filled with people and storybook characters.http://lewisparker.ca/biography.html In 1939, Parker attended Central Technical School in Toronto. Ever self-motivated, he applied his disciplined approach to all studies. Seldom openly defiant, Parker submitted his own versions of assignments, always far more detailed than required.http://lewisparker.ca/biography.html From 1941 to 1944, Parker apprenticed at Rabjohn Illustrators, where he met a significant mentor, Bert Grassick.http://www.cbu.ca/sites/cbu.ca/files/pdfs/li-LEWIS%20PARKER.pdf His formative experience at Rabjohn influenced the connections he later made with artists in Toronto’s art scene. Enlisting in the Canadian Army in World War 11 between 1944 and 1946, Parker gained valuable experience as a cartoonist and illustrator for the Maple Leaf, Canada’s overseas newspaper. Artistic career After World War 2, Parker became a political cartoonist for the ‘yellow pages’ that bookended Maclean's Magazine in the 1950s. Between 1947 and 1956, he formed a commercial art firm with Bill Sherman and Gordon and Norman Laws called Sherman, Laws and Parker, a business focusing on visual arts in advertising. During this time, Parker recognized a need to design his own direction in the artistic milieu.http://lewisparker.ca/biography.html Between 1966 and 1968, Parker received two Canada Council Grants. The first was to study the Aztec and Mayan cultures in Mexico, where he relocated for a year with his family in 1966, completing several historical works.http://lewisparker.ca/biography.html The second, awarded in 1968, enabled him to travel with wildlife photographer Eugene Aliman to western Canada to study the Plains Indians.http://lewisparker.ca/biography.html Parker was then commissioned by the Huronia Council of Ontario to create historical paintings for Sainte-Marie-Among-the- Hurons.http://www.cbu.ca/sites/cbu.ca/files/pdfs/li-LEWIS%20PARKER.pdf This series included on-site presentations of pre-European Native life on location at the site in Midland, Ontario.http://www.cbu.ca/sites/cbu.ca/files/pdfs/li- LEWIS%20PARKER.pdf Between 1968 and 1974, Parker worked in collaboration with acclaimed painter Gerald Lazare on several extended projects. One of these, entitled the \\"Huron Collection\\",http://lewisparker.ca/hurons/HuronGalleries.html was a series of 36 paintings depicting the life and culture of Canada’s Huron Natives. Between 1970 and 1974, Parker, again in collaboration with Gerald Lazare, created the ‘Indians of Canada’ series for the Wildlife Federation. The National Film Board of Canada then commissioned Lazare and Parker to create an illustrative series for film work on the Beluga Whale and the Plains Indians.http://www.cbu.ca/sites/cbu.ca/files/pdfs/li-LEWIS%20PARKER.pdf Between 1972 and 1974, the partnership was commissioned to visually depict the history of mankind from Australopithecus to current times in the Museum of Man in Ottawa. The tableaux showing this evolution was painted inside three domes of the museum building, each which had a double curve and measured 16 feet by 75 feet.http://lewisparker.ca/biography.html Parker and Lazare worked in preparation for a full year with research specialists of the museum. The final massive painting took eight months to complete, with Parker and Lazare doing one each and joining forces to complete the third.http://www.cbu.ca/sites/cbu.ca/files/pdfs/li-LEWIS%20PARKER.pdf Between 1974 and 1976, Parker rendered a series of historical artworks to be used as stills for both the National Film Board of Canada and the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education.http://genwiki.mcfadyen.ca/index.php/Parker,_Lewis_Edgar_Hyde_- _Career Between 1980 and 1982, Lewis began his journey into in-depth historical paintings with Parks Canada, depicting key scenes in Maritime history. The first, set in 1758, was entitled \\"The Expulsion of the Acadians from Prince Edward Island\\". This painting, commissioned specifically to be used in a film presentation, has been requested for reproduction in part or in full on numerous occasions .http://lewisparker.ca/media/CapeBretonPostArticle.html The second was called, \\"The Building of the Dikes at Grand Pre\\".http://www.cbu.ca/sites/cbu.ca/files/pdfs/li-LEWIS%20PARKER.pdf Parker then completed seven paintings for Fort Beausejour, portraying the fortification at different periods in history, with reproduction of the finished artwork located in displays around the fort.http://www.cbu.ca/sites/cbu.ca/files/pdfs/li-LEWIS%20PARKER.pdf Parker was then recruited to create the Louisbourg murals, where he translated on site a wealth of information from historians and archeologists into two huge canvases focusing on maritime life in the 18th century town.http://lewisparker.ca/media/CapeBretonPostArticle.html An outstanding artistic success,http://lewisparker.ca/media/CapeBretonPostArticle.html these montage murals are viewed by thousands of visitors yearly, with the Fortress of Louisbourg receiving numerous requests to reproduce details from these paintings for books, DVD’s and films.http://lewisparker.ca/media/CapeBretonPostArticle.html Awards In 1986, Parker won both domestic and international awards for a book co-created with author Debra McNabb called, \\"Old Sydney Town: Historic Buildings of the North End\\".http://lewisparker.ca/media/CapeBretonPostArticle.html In 1993, Parker received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Canadian Association of Professional Image Makers CAPIC Recognition Canada Post: On 4 April 1975 Canada Post issued 'Ceremonial Dress' designed by Georges Beaupré, based on a painting by Lewis Parker (artist) of a ceremonial costume of the Kutchin tribe /Gwich'in people.

It is the seat of the Koźmin Wielkopolski urban-rural gmina, which has a population of 13,739 people . Until January 1, 1997, the town's official name was \\"Koźmin\\"; \\"Wielkopolski\\" was then added to the name. History Koźmin Wielkopolski Castle, now a museum A medieval Polish settlement existed at the site as early as the 12th century. The oldest known mention of Koźmin comes from 1232, it was a village owned by the Knights Templar. It was granted town rights between 1251 and 1283. In 1338, King Casimir III the Great gave the town to Maćko Borowiec, who built a castle there. The castle, located along present-day Zamkowa Street, is still in use today; it houses a school and the Muzeum Ziemi Koźminskiej (Museum of the Koźmin Land). Koźmin was a private town located in the Kalisz Voivodeship in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. The town changed owners several times; it was the property of the Górkas, a prominent Greater Poland family, in the 16th century, and later belonged to the Sapieha family. It was considered one of the most powerful towns in Greater Poland in the 15th and 16th century. Koźmin prospered through trade and crafts. In the 17th century it was a local Reformation center. After the Second Partition of Poland, in 1793, it was annexed by Prussia. Regained by Poles in 1807, it was included in the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, in 1815 it was re-annexed by Prussia. The Poles took part both in the unsuccessful Greater Poland uprising of 1848 and the victorious Greater Poland uprising of 1918–1919, after which Kobylin was integrated with Poland, shortly after it regained independence. During World War II, Koźmin Wielkopolski was under German occupation from 6 September 1939 to 23 January 1945. One of the best-preserved Jewish cemeteries in Greater Poland is located in Koźmin Wielkopolski, along Wierzbowa Street. It includes more than 250 graves, dating back as far as 1806. The cemetery is maintained by a local teacher, Jerzy Fornalik, who is also the author of a multicultural education program, \\"Anty- Schematy,\\" for students from Poland, Israel, Germany, and other countries. A former women's prison from World War II, which housed female political prisoners under the Nazi occupation, is located along present-day Klasztorna Street. Currently a youth education center is located in the building. Some of the prisoners are buried in a mass grave, commemorated by a monument, in the cemetery along Poznańska Street.

He drew comparisons between the film and Woody Allen's early films (\\"in spirit and ambition, if not in execution\\").

First flown in 1985, it has been launched 37 times, with 6 failures. It is a member of the Zenit family of rockets and was designed by the Yuzhmash. History With 13–15 ton payload in LEO, it was intended as up-middle-class launcher greater than 7-ton-payload middle Soyuz and smaller than 20-ton- payload heavy Proton. Zenit-2 would be certified for crewed launches and placed in specially built launch pad at Baykonur spaceport, carrying the new crewed partially reusable Zarya spacecraft that developed in end of the 1980s but was cancelled. Also in the 1980s Vladimir Chelomey's firm proposed the never realised 15-ton Uragan spaceplane, which would have been launched by Zenit-2. A modified version, the Zenit-2S, is used as the first two stages of the Sea Launch Zenit-3SL rocket. Launches of Zenit-2 rockets are conducted from Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 45/1. A second pad, 45/2, was also constructed, but was only used for two launches before being destroyed in an explosion. A third pad, Site 35 at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome was never completed, and work was abandoned after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Zenit-2 had its last flight in 2004; it has been superseded by the Zenit-2M, which incorporates enhancements made during the development of the Zenit-3SL. The Zenit-2 has a fairly low flight rate, as the Russian government usually avoids flying national-security payloads on Ukrainian rockets. Zenit-2M itself flew only twice: in 2007 and 2011. During the late 1990s, the Zenit-2 was marketed for commercial launches. Only one such launch was conducted, with a group of Globalstar satellites, which ended in failure after a computer error resulted in the premature cutoff of the second stage.

Other common names for this cartridge include 6.5×47mm. Features Thanks to the relatively long neck of the 6.5×47mm Lapua, it can be loaded with very long target bullets without placing the base of the bullet below the neck. This eliminates the \\"donut problem\\" seen by many cases that get reloaded over 20 times. Left to right: Lapua FMJ 144gr, Hornady 123gr loaded to a COAL of 2.71in, and a Hornady 123gr A-Max. The cartridge has many special features, including: * The cartridge chamber dimensions are optimized for target bullets. * High pressure level ( Pmax piezo pressure) and cartridge case capacity enables relative high velocity and flat trajectory. * Reduced barrel wear compared to 6mm Norma BR * The 6.5×47mm Lapua has a base diameter and overall length similar to the 7.62×51mm NATO/.308 Winchester, allowing it to accept the same bolt heads and fit into similar short actions and magazines. History The 6.5×47mm Lapua has no direct parent case. It was designed by Lapua with a great deal of help from Swiss rifle manufacturer, Grünig & Elmiger. The case also borrows many characteristics from the 6mm PPC and has proven itself to be inherently accurate. Cartridge dimensions The 6.5×47mm Lapua has 3.11 ml (48.0 grains H2O) cartridge case capacity. 400px 6.5×47mm Lapua maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimeters (mm).C.I.P.

The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 200 mm (1 in 7.87 in), 6 grooves, Ø lands = , Ø grooves = , land width = , and the primer type is small rifle. According to the official C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives) rulings the 6.5×47mm Lapua can handle up to Pmax piezo pressure. In C.I.P. regulated countries every rifle cartridge combo has to be proofed at 125% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers. This means that 6.5×47mm Lapua chambered arms in C.I.P. regulated countries are currently (2018) proof tested at PE piezo pressure. Performance The 6.5×47mm Lapua is a medium power cartridge often compared to the .260 Remington and 6.5 Creedmoor.Demigod short action 6.5mm comparison article It was designed from the beginning by Lapua to optimize accuracy, barrel life, and case capacity in a 6.5 mm cartridge for target and tactical shooting. As such it couples a sensible case volume (3.11 ml) to bore area (34.59 mm2/0.3459 cm2) ratio with ample space for loading relatively long slender projectiles that can provide good aerodynamic efficiency and external ballistic performance for the projectile diameter. The 6.5×47mm Lapua offers slightly lower muzzle velocities than 6.5 mm/.260 cartridges such as the .260 Remington and 6.5 Creedmoor, because of its smaller case volume. In an article by the Precision Rifle Blog a survey of the top 100 shooters in the precision rifle series (PRS) showed that the 6.5 Creedmoor was on average faster than the 6.5×47mm Lapua. Although the 6.5×47mm Lapua is said to have superior brass quality compared to the 6.5 Creedmoor.

Variants Soon after the introduction of the 6.5×47mm Lapua, shooters were using the case as the basis for a new wildcat, by necking it down to 6 mm. This wildcat cartridge is often called a 6-6.5×47 to avoid confusing it with the 6×47 Swiss Match, a similar case but with a large rifle primer. Another version that has been popular is a necked-down version with a 40-degree shoulder. PTG sells reamers for this and it has demonstrated a gain of about 100 fps over the standard 6-6.5×47.

The film closed the 2006 Venice Film Festival, proved to be a moderate box-office success and won both the Nika Award and the China TV Golden Eagle Award as the Best Russian film of 2006. The filming location was the city of Kem, in Karelia, on the shores of the White Sea. It received generally positive reviews from critics.  Plot  During World War II, the sailor Anatoly and his captain, Tikhon, are captured by the Germans when they board their barge and tugboat, which is carrying a shipment of coal. The German officer leading the raid offers Anatolywho is terrified of dyingthe choice to be shot or to shoot Tikhon and stay alive, which Anatoly takes; he shoots, and Tikhon falls overboard. The Germans blow up the ship but Anatoly is found by Russian Orthodox monks on the shore the next morning. He survives and becomes a stoker at the monastery but is perpetually overcome with guilt. Thirty years pass. Anatoly now has the gifts of prophecy and healing. But the other monks do not really understand him. People come to see Anatoly for cures and guidance, but even now, he remains in a perpetual state of repentance. He often gets in a boat and goes to an uninhabited island where he prays for mercy and forgiveness. Many years pass, and an admiral of the North Fleet arrives at the monastery. He brings his daughter who is possessed by a demon, but Anatoly exorcises it. The admiral turns out to be Tikhon. It is revealed that Anatoly only wounded him in the arm. Tikhon forgives Anatoly. Anatoly announces his death by Wednesday; the monks provide a coffin. Dressed in a white garment such as Jesus wore or as an Orthodox baptismal garment, he lies in the coffin, wearing a crucifix. Monks, one carrying a large cross representing the risen Christ, are seen rowing the coffin away from the island. Image:Russia rabocheostrovsk ostrovs scenery belltower.jpgBell tower Image:Russia Rabocheostrovsk Ostrovs scenery barge.jpgBarge  Spiritual message  The film is focused on father Anatoly's repentance of his sin (therefore the virtually continuous occurrence of the Jesus Prayer); but the transgressions of the depicted character (a fool for Christ) and their impact on the others are the means by which the actual plot develops. The film's director Pavel Lungin, speaking of the central character's self-awareness, said he doesn't regard him as being clever or spiritual, but blessed \\"in the sense that he is an exposed nerve, which connects to the pains of this world. His absolute power is a reaction to the pain of those people who come to it;\\" while \\"typically, when the miracle happens, the lay people asking for a miracle are always dissatisfied\\" because \\"the world does not tolerate domestic miracles.\\" Screenwriter Dmitry Sobolev further explains: \\"When a person asks God for something, he is often wrong because God has a better understanding of what a person needs at that moment.\\"«Остров».

The village of Horstead in the county of Norfolk is not short of country houses. Towards Norwich lie Horstead House and Heggatt Hall, while towards Buxton lies the Horstead Hall estate. The house lay in the middle of a substantial park. A seventeenth-century house stood here until 1835, when it was rebuilt in the Tudor style by Edward Harbord, 3rd Baron Suffield. The lodges, one at Mayton, the other on the Buxton-Horstead Road, date from this period. Edward Harbord, 3rd Baron Suffield rebuilt the house for his eldest, Edward Vernon Harbord, 4th Baron Suffield son on his marriage to Miss Gardiner. However, the third Baron died from injuries sustained in a riding accident on the day of the wedding, and the house was adapted for the use of the dowager baroness. Charles Harbord, 5th Baron Suffield was brought up at the hall. Following his inheritance of Gunton Park, the house was let out until it was bought by the Birkbeck family. Owners included the Batcheler family (18th century), the Suffields, who rebuilt the house, and latterly the Birkbecks. Sir Edward Birkbeck entertained Prime Minister Lord Salisbury there in 1887. During World War II the house was requisitioned by the War Office and used by a cipher unit, who put up numerous huts in the grounds, some of which survive. The hall's Italianate watertower, which stood among outbuildings, now derelict, is visible from the roads around the park. A chapel also survives, equally derelict. The estate was sold in 1947 and most of the house came down soon after. Today part of the estate is used for quarrying. Substantial estate buildings survive, and part of the house remains, albeit in derelict condition. A pipe organ from the house is in the church at Ashby St. Mary.

The cemetery is a memorial to and burial ground for thousands of Latvian soldiers who were killed between 1915 and 1920 in World War I and the Latvian War of Independence. The landscape was designed by gardener Andrejs Zeidaks, who started to work on it already during the war. The memorial was built between 1924 and 1936, to designs by the sculptor Kārlis Zāle, many of whose sculptures feature prominently, the architects Pēteris Feders, Aleksandrs Birzenieks, P. Kundziņš, the sculptors J. Cirulis and F. Valdmanis and others.  History  In 1913 the Forest Cemetery was opened. In 1914 Riga Cathedral and St. Peter's church set aside a parcel of land for 146 burials of soldiers who did not belong to any congregation of Riga in the part of the cemetery intended for the dead from their congregations. The first soldiers buried there, on 15 October 1915, were Andrejs Stūris, Jonas Gavenas and Jēkabs Voldemārs Timma. As the war continued it became clear that land for more burials would be needed. The organization committee of Latvian Riflemen battalions turned to the churches for more land, but the request was denied. The committee then turned to Riga City Council, which had allotted the land for cemetery, arguing that reasons for refusal the churches had named were questionable and unreasonable in the time of war. The conflict was ultimately solved in 1916 by the churches agreeing to return part of the land to the city for formation of a separate cemetery, which in turn allotted it to the committee. The initial outlay of the cemetery was designed by Andrejs Zeidaks, then the head gardener of the city. In 1920 a committee for overseeing cemeteries and battlefields from World War I was formed, which became responsible for the development of the Brothers' Cemetery. The development of the memorial can thus be roughly divided into two periods. First was the period of landscape development, which lasted until 1923, when the landscaping was developed according to Zeidaks' ideas. Meanwhile, the architectonic and artistic development of the cemetery was being discussed. In 1921 and in 1922 two closed design contests took place. The sculptor Kārlis Zāle, who was visiting Riga to participate in the design contest for the Freedom Monument, was invited to take part in the second contest for the cemetery as well. He won, and the second phase of development began, which lasted until 1936. In this period the landscaping was supplemented by architectonic and sculptural elements to form a unified ensemble in accordance with Zāle's design. The architectural works were directed by P. Feders; the architect A. Birznieks and the sculptors M. Šmalcs, N. Maulics and P. Banders were also involved. The foundation stone of the memorial was laid on 18 November 1924. The first sculptural group, of dying horsemen, was unveiled on 20 November 1927, the second on 2 September 1928. The sculpture of Mother Latvia and her dead sons was unveiled on 13 October 1929. Construction of the main gates began in 1930. Statues of soldiers with shields symbolizing the four regions of Latvia were carved later. In 1936 the coats of arms of the 19 districts and the 59 cities of Latvia were carved in the wall of the cemetery. The cemetery was formally dedicated as a memorial on 11 November 1936 in the presence of the President of Latvia and the government.  Design  Sculpture of a horseman Sculpture at Brāļu Kapi The cemetery consists of an area of 9 hectares in northeastern Riga, 5 kilometers from the city center. It borders the First Forest Cemetery and Rainis Cemetery. The memorial expresses national gratitude to the fallen heroes through cultural references to the Latvian nation. The main gate of the cemetery is 10 meters high and 32 meters wide. To either side of the entrance, on 2 meter high platforms are 3.3 meters high sculptures each representing a pair of ancient Latvian horsemen. The riders and horses in the right hand sculptural group have straight stances; one of the horses has its head thrown back, and upward movement dominates in the group. This is in contrast to the left hand group, which is dominated by downward movement as expressed through the bowed heads of the riders and horses; the riders have lowered their shields and the flags they are carrying. Above the entrance the dates 1915 (when the first burials in the cemetery were made) and 1920 (the last year of the Latvian War of Independence) are displayed; between the two dates the gate is decorated with the coat of arms of Latvia. From the main entrance the 205 meters long Road of Thoughts leads through an avenue of linden trees to the Terrace of Heroes, encircled by an oak grove planted in 1923. The terrace, paved with slabs of tufa, is about 73 meters wide and 78 meters long; in its center is placed the 1 meter high altar of sacred fire. In the 1930s a sacred fire was lit on it on important holidays. It was later redesigned as a gas-fed eternal flame. As the Terrace of Heroes rises above the Road of Thoughts it hides from sight the central burial ground, which is on a lower level than the Road of Thoughts, until one has crossed the terrace, which thus provides a panorama of the burial ground and forms a barrier between the worlds of the living and of the dead. There is a parapet with flower altar on edge of the Terrace facing the burial ground. At the outer end of the burial ground on 9 meters high base, which makes it visible from main entrance 457 meters away, there is a 10 meters high sculpture of grieving mother Latvia and her dead sons. The mother, dressed in stylized national costume, is holding a victory wreath of oak leaves made of bronze in her left hand and the national flag with the right hand. At her feet her fallen sons are lying under their shields, both holding swords in their hands. In the wall under the sculpture a cross is carved and there is a niche with a tray holding soil from 517 parishes of Latvia. This central group is sided by two 1.8 meters high sculptures of ancient Latvian warriors standing on 1.2 meters high bases, who symbolize the Regions of Latvia as they are bearing regional coats of arms on their shields - the two warriors to left symbolize Courland and Semigalia, while the two on right - Vidzeme and Latgale. The main burial ground is rectangular and encircled by walls. At the end closer to main entrance in the corners of the main burial field there are 3.6 meters high sculptures of wounded horsemen. Next to each sculpture there are staircases leading towards the outside of cemetery. Between the main burial ground and the Terrace of Heroes there is another, lower terrace with burials. At the bottom of the terrace on the main burial grounds there is Alto-relievo Fallen brothers. The graves on the burial ground are ordered in lines and there is hedge between each two lines. The grave markers are tufa or concrete slabs on them the name, surname, rank and lifetime of the fallen, or \\"unknown\\" is written. The wall is decorated with coats of arms of cities and districts of Latvia. There are additional burial grounds to the left of main burial ground when looking from main entrance.  Burials  A grave marker marking grave of an unknown soldier; about 200 of soldiers buried in the cemetery were never identified The plaque reads \\"Unknown soldier of the Latvian Army, died in the Gulag\\" The cemetery contains more than 2,000 burials, mostly of soldiers who were killed between 1915 and 1920 in World War I and the Latvian War of Independence. It also contains a number of graves, including reburials, of Latvians killed during World War II and of holders of the Lāčplēsis War Order (), awarded for extraordinary merit during the Latvian War of Independence. Also many Latvian Rifleman veterans were buried in the cemetery it was practiced even under Soviet rule.

She achieved a place of prominence through her iconic images of the horse, in which she synthesized the opposing forces of abstraction and representation. Early life and education Rothenberg was born in Buffalo, New York, on January 20, 1945, the daughter of Adele (Cohen), a president of the Buffalo Red Cross, and Leonard Rothenberg, who owned a supermarket chain. In 1965 she graduated from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. In 1967 she went to Washington, D.C., and studied at George Washington University and the Corcoran Museum School. In 1969 she moved to New York, where she became a member of a dedicated community of artists. Through large acrylic paintings featuring emblematic, life-sized images of horses, largely monochromatic, she established her reputation in the New York art world in the early 1970s. Career Untitled (Horse) 1976 Rothenberg’s first solo exhibition in New York in 1975 was at the 112 Greene Street Gallery. Consisting of three large-scale paintings of horses, it was heralded for introducing imagery into minimalist abstraction, while bringing a new sensitivity to figuration. Critic Peter Schjeldahl called the show \\"a eureka,\\" stating that \\"the large format of the pictures was a gesture of ambition,\\" and that \\"the mere reference to something really existing was astonishing.\\" From the mid-1970s on Rothenberg has been recognized as one of the most innovative and independent artists of her period of contemporary period. During an era when minimalism was at the forefront of the New York Art scene, she stood out because of her reintroduction of expression and figuration. Rothenberg’s horse figures of the 70s contained some degree of minimalism because of their repetitive qualities, her hectic yet loose rendering of the figures blended the earlier conventions of abstract expressionism and color field painting. By the early 1980s, she was focusing on disembodied heads and body parts, and by the end of the decade she was painting complex and symbolic figurative works full of color and movement. After moving to a ranch near Galisteo, New Mexico, her paintings reflected life in the Southwestern United States and became suffused with color. Beginning in the 1990s, she used the 'memory of observed and experienced events' (a riding accident, a near-fatal bee sting, and other events) as the inspiration for her subjects and adopted oil paint as her favored medium. As in her earlier works, these paintings are distinguished by thickly layered, energetic brushwork and exhibit her interest in exploring the relationship between images and surface. In 2010, New York Times art critic David Belcher wrote that comparisons between Rothenberg and Georgia O'Keeffe had \\"become hard to avoid.\\" From her early years in SoHo through her move to New Mexico's desert landscape, Rothenberg has remained as influenced and challenged by her physical surroundings as she is by artistic issues and personal experiences. In addition to her earliest horse paintings, Rothenberg has taken on numerous forms as subject matter, such as dancing figures, heads and bodies, animals, and atmospheric landscapes. Rothenberg's visceral canvases have continued to evolve, as she explores the boundary between figural representation and abstraction; her work also examines the role of color and light, and the translation of her personal experience to a painterly surface. However, Rothenberg has challenged these comparisons to O'Keeffe, stating that they are \\"completely different people\\" with different artistic energies. Though they both gained inspiration from the New Mexico landscape, Rothenberg's paintings contain a significantly more aggressive quality. Later career Although best known as a painter, Rothenberg also made crucial contributions to the medium of drawing. On the occasion of her 2004 exhibition of drawings at Sperone Westwater, Robert Storr wrote, \\"...fundamentally, drawing is as much a matter of evocation as it is of depiction, of identifying the primary qualities of things in the world and transposing them without a loss of quiddity. This at any rate is what drawing has been for Rothenberg.\\" Exhibitions Rothenberg's work has been the subject solo exhibitions throughout the United States and abroad. Her first major survey, initiated by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, traveled to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Carnegie Institute, and the Tate Gallery, London, among other institutions (1983–1985). More recent exhibitions of her work include a retrospective organized by Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York (1992–1994), which traveled to Washington, D.C., St. Louis, Chicago, and Seattle (1992); a retrospective at the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo in Monterrey, Mexico (1996); a survey of prints and drawings presented by the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, Cornell University (1998); and Susan Rothenberg: Paintings from the Nineties at The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (1999). Her 1976 work \\"Butterfly\\" was displayed in the Treaty Room of the White House during the Obama Administration. Awards Rothenberg was the recipient of the National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship Grant (1979), the Cornell University Alumni Award (1998), the Skowhegan Medal for Painting (1998), and Sweden's Rolf Schock Prize (2003). Personal life and death Rothenberg was married to sculptor George Trakas from 1971 to 1979. The couple have a daughter, Maggie, born in 1972. She married the artist Bruce Nauman in 1989. Her relationship with Nauman, another prominent artist, has prompted more associations with Georgia O'Keeffe because of her relationship with Alfred Stieglitz. Rothenberg died at her home in Galisteo, New Mexico on May 18, 2020, at age 75. Museum exhibitions *1976, The Sable-Castelli Gallery, Toronto.

(2008). . M. Sc. Walla Walla University, College Place, WA: 91 Its range extends from the southern Gulf of California at least to the Gulf of Alaska, but may also occur in the western Pacific Ocean. O. rubescens occurs intertidally to a depth of 300 m.Hochberg, F.G. (1997). Octopus rubescens. Proceedings of the workshop on the fishery and market potential of octopus in California. Smithsonian Institution (Washington, DC). Taxonomy In the years prior to the description of this species in 1953, O. rubescens was widely considered to be a young Enteroctopus dofleini. Many early descriptions were based on a combination of O. rubescens and E. dofleini.Hochberg, F.G. (1998). Octopus rubescens. In: P.V. Scott & J.A. Blake (Eds.) Taxonomic Atlas of the Benthic Fauna of the Santa Maria Basin and the Western Santa Barbara Channel: Vol. 8. (pp. 213–218). Santa Barbara, California, Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. To date, the taxonomy of this species remains somewhat unresolved. S.S. Berry’s 1953 description is in truth a brief diagnosis,Berry, S.S. 1953. Preliminary diagnoses of six west American species of Octopus. Leaflets in Malacology 1:51–58. and considering the exceptionally wide range of the species, the animals currently covered under O. rubescens may prove to represent several subspecies or a species complex. Size and description O. rubescens in captivity O. rubescens generally grows to a mantle length of 8–10 cm, and arm length of 30–40 cm. Adult weight is generally 100–150 grams, but animals up to 400 grams in weight have occasionally been observed.Dorsey, E.M. (1976). Natural history and social behavior of Octopus rubescens (Berry). M. Sc. University of Washington, Seattle, WA: 44. Like all octopuses, O. rubescens can change its color and texture, making its appearance highly variable. Color can vary from a deep brick red, to brown, to white, or mottled mixtures of the three. It can be easily confused with small individuals of Enteroctopus dofleini in the northern end of this species' range. The two can be differentiated by the presence of three eyelash-like papillae below the eyes of O. rubescens that are absent in E. dofleini.Anderson, R.C. (2006). \\"On West Coast Octopuses including a field key to west coast species.\\" The Festivus 38(1): 5–6. Intelligence Like most octopuses, O. rubescens is thought to be among the most intelligent of invertebrates. The presence of individual personalities is a hallmark of intelligence, and O. rubescens was the first invertebrate in which individual personalities were demonstrated.Mather, J.A. & R.C. Anderson (1993). \\"Personalities of Octopuses (Octopus rubescens).\\" Journal of Comparative Psychology 107(3): 336–340.  Diet and foraging behavior  O. rubescens is a generalist predator and has been maintained on a wide variety of gastropods, bivalves, crabs and barnacles in the lab. So far, very little quantification of its diet in the wild has been made. The two studies on the subject determined diets in Puget Sound, Washington to be dominated by gastropods, particularly Nucella lamellosa and Olivella baetica, but also composed of clams, scallops and crabs.Anderson, R.C., P.D. Hughes, J.A. Mather & C.W. Steele (1999). \\"Determination of the diet of Octopus rubescens though examination of its beer bottle dens in Puget Sound.\\" Malacologia 41(2): 455–460. The planktonic larvae of O. rubescens have also been observed in the wild to consume krill.Laidig, T.E., Adams, P.B., Baxter, C.H. & Butler, J.L. (1995). Feeding on euphausiids by Octopus rubescens. California Fish and Game Technical Report 81(2): 77–79. As part of its feeding behavior, O. rubescens will pounce on prey and display a stereotypical sequence of color changes at the moment of capture.Warren, L. R., Scheier, M. F. & Riley, D.A. (1974). Colour changes of Octopus rubescens during attacks on unconditioned and conditioned stimuli. Animal Behaviour 22(1): 211–219. Following the capture of bivalve prey, it will often drill a hole through the shell to deliver venom and more easily open the shell. The octopuses will often concentrate their drill holes near the adductor muscles of the bivalve prey.Anderson, R. C., Sinn, D. L. & Mather, J.A. (2008). The Veliger 50(4): 326–328. A recent study has suggested O. rubescens may choose prey based on fat digestibility rather than on the amount of calories the octopuses is able to obtain from the food items.Onthank, K.L. and Cowles, D.L. (2011). Prey selection in Octopus rubescens: Possible roles of energy budgeting and prey nutritional composition. Marine Biology 158(12): 2795–2804. If this is true, the authors further argue, this would make O. rubescens a specialist predator by some measures, rather than a generalist, due to it specific nutrient requirements.
