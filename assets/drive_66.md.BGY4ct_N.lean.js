She is foremost known as the instigator of the political demonstration by the noblewomen toward Gustav III in opposition of his parliamentary act of 1789. Life She was the daughter of Riksr√•d count Erik von Stockenstr√∂m and Johanna Bedoire and was married in 1777 to Baron Albrekt von Lantingshausen. Johanna von Lantingshausen was a popular socialite and known for her performances within the amateur theater of Gustav III of Sweden: she was formerly a maid of honor to Sophia Magdalena of Denmark and a personal friend of Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp. She was also a personal friend of Gustav III of Sweden: at Gripsholm Castle in the winter of 1776, for example, it is mentioned how she, the King and Hedvig Eleonora von Fersen persuaded Johan Gabriel Oxenstierna, Lewenhaupt and Adolf Ludvig Hamilton to join them in the prank to awake the sleeping courtiers from bed at night by surprising them in their beds. =Conflict with the monarch= At the stormy Assembly of the Estates in 1789, were Gustav III needed the support to continue the ongoing Russo-Swedish war, the monarch came into open conflict with the nobility, which was in opposition to the war and the Union and Security Act: he used the other estates to defeat the nobility and had many representatives of the nobility placed in house arrest and imprisoned. This caused a break between Gustav III and the nobility, and it was demonstrated by a social boycott of him led by the female members of the aristocracy: the noblewomen made a political demonstration of their opinions by turning down all private invitations and socializing with him in his capacity of a private person: they demonstrated by visiting the Princesses, Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp and Sophie Albertine of Sweden, who were also known to be in opposition to Gustav III, while at the same time turning down his invitations. Jeanna von Lantingshausen was the leader of this political demonstration of female nobles, and is reported to have been the instigator of it. Gustav III took deep offence of their \\"Fronde\\"-making and likened the noblewomen's way of political demonstration to the \\"hags\\" of the French revolution and said himself to fear that they would storm him at the Gustav III's Pavilion as the Women's March on Versailles. He replied to their demonstration by writing and performing a play in which Johanna von Lantingshausen was publicly mocked. According to Elis Schr√∂derheim, this demonstration made Gustav III lose his former friends, and to spend more time with his male favorites such as Georg Johan De Besche, in which he indulged in ill-reputed orgies with prostitutes. The demonstration also led to a conflict with the Queen in the autumn of 1790. That autumn, the King chose to remain in the summer residence of Drottningholm Palace well in to the autumn because of the social boycott. Finally, the Queen returned to the capital without his consent, which made him accuse her of having been manipulated by the oppositional of the female courtiers to participate in the political demonstration and refusing him the company of her ladies-in-waiting by leaving. This conflict ended by a demonstration of power from the monarch: he wished to set an example, and Jeanna von Lantingshausen was chosen to play this part as the leader of the whole demonstration. In 1790, Gustav III had her officially banished from court and all places in which it was possible for her to come in contact with members of the royal house, such as the Royal Swedish Opera. Johanna von Lantingshausen asked for a formal instruction to be sent and read to her by an official, and this instruction was thereafter read to her in her by police official Nils Henric Liljensparre, who read it to her in her salon where she had her guests gathered as witnesses. This event is mentioned in many contemporary memoirs, letters and diaries and regarded as a scandal, particularly as it was read by Liljensparre, who normally arrested prostitutes, and it contributed to the unpopularity and aristocratic opposition toward Gustav III during his last years as monarch. Her banishment lasted until the death of Gustav III. In fiction Jeanna von Lantingshausen is portrayed in the novel Pottungen (Chamber pot child) by Anna Laestadius Larsson from 2014, where she, alongside Ulrika Pasch, Anna Maria Lenngren, Ulrika Widstr√∂m, Marianne Ehrenstr√∂m and Sophie von Fersen, becomes a member in a Blue Stockings Society organized by Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp.

Modern Family is an American television mockumentary family sitcom created by Christopher Lloyd and Steven Levitan for the American Broadcasting Company. It ran for eleven seasons, from September 23, 2009 to April 8, 2020. It follows the lives of Jay Pritchett and his family in suburban Los Angeles, including his second wife, her son (his stepson), their son, and his two adult children and their husbands and children. It was aired on March 27, 2013. The episode was written by Ben Karlin and it was directed by Steven Levitan. Jesse Tyler Ferguson submitted this episode for consideration due to his nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series at the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards. Ferguson also named this episode as his favorite one of the fourth season. Plot Cam (Eric Stonestreet) and Claire (Julie Bowen) work together on a house's renovation that they are going to flip later, but they seem to disagree in many things. A disagreement on their visions about the backyard, makes Cam call his lesbian friend, Pam (Wendi McLendon-Covey), whose son is at the same school with Lily (Aubrey Anderson- Emmons), to tell them what she thinks since she is working on the constructions. When Pam agrees with Claire, Cam does not like it very much, so he goes ahead on his own and makes the fountain he wanted on the backyard to prove them that he is right. Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) drops off Lily at school, when he sees that there is a playground bully named Milo (Luke Grakal) who is terrifying the other kids. His first attempt to teach him a lesson of not being a bully is not going that well, so he asks for Luke's (Nolan Gould) help. When he later goes back to school for his second attempt, he takes it way too far. Meanwhile, Jay (Ed O'Neill) encourages Gloria (Sofia Vergara) to spend some time with Manny (Rico Rodriguez) since she feels like she is ignoring him lately because of Joe, and he will spend some quality time with Joe. Gloria asks him to not forget to take Joe to his baby class. On his way there, he encounters with an old high school friend of Claire's, Rachel (Margaret Easley), and after the little talk they have, Jay decides to skip the baby class and go with the baby to the movies. Joe starts crying and Rachel offers to take him outside till the movie ends. When Gloria sees her baby with a stranger (to her, anyway, but not to Jay), things do not seem very auspicious for Jay. At the Dunphys house, Phil (Ty Burrell) tries to teach Alex (Ariel Winter) and Haley (Sarah Hyland) few basic things about home improvement. On his try to explain them how the water heater works, he breaks it and his efforts to fix it just make things worse. Seeing that he can not fix it, he asks the girls to go to the store to buy him something, so he can stay alone and call his dad (Fred Willard) to tell him what to do.

Biography He was descended from an ancient Corsican family, the eldest son of Tommaso (Thomas) Mazzinghi (d. Old St. Pancras 1775), a wine merchant settled in London. According to Cansick, the composer's father, was violinist at Marylebone Gardens. A Tommaso Mazzinghi composed and published six solos for the violin, London, 1763. Mazzinghi was born on 25 December 1765. His mother's sister, Cassandra Frederich (afterwards Mrs. Wynne), a pianist, interested herself in his musical training, and he was a pupil of Johann Christian Bach, and later of Bertolini, Antonio Sacchini, and Pasquale Anfossi. At the age of ten, he became organist to the Portuguese Chapel (1775). He is said to have held the post of composer and director of music at the Italian opera from 1785 to 1792. Career He may have assisted the advertised directors, Pasquale Anfossi and Luigi Cherubini, at the King's Theatre, Haymarket, but it was not until 9 January 1787, that his connection with the theatre was advertised, when Cimarosa's ‚ÄòGiannina e Bernardone‚Äô was announced, ‚Äòunder the direction of Signor Mazzinghi,‚Äô for 9 Jan. 1787. Several songs in the pasticcio were by him. On 8 December 1787, Paisiello's ‚ÄòIl Re Teodoro in Venezia‚Äô was performed, with Mazzinghi, who had supplied some of the music, at the harpsichord. While holding the office Mazzinghi was not only responsible for alterations of and additions to various Italian operas, but brought out several ballets: ‚ÄòL'Amour et Pasiche‚Äô on 6 March 1788, ‚ÄòSapho et Phaon,‚Äô ‚ÄòEliza,‚Äô and others. He remained at his post until the King's Theatre was burnt down on 17 June 1789. In 1791, he was director of the Pantheon, the managers of which had succeeded in securing the one license granted for Italian opera. The Pantheon was, in its turn, destroyed by fire on 14 Jan. 1792. On 1 March, Mazzinghi conducted at the ‚ÄòLittle Theatre in the Haymarket,‚Äô called then Theatre Royal, Paisiello's ‚ÄòLa Locanda.‚Äô He had reconstructed the opera, the score of which had been lost in the fire. The new King's Theatre, Haymarket, opened for Italian opera under other direction in 1793. In the meantime, Mazzinghi had set music to Merry's comic opera, ‚ÄòThe Magician no Conjuror,‚Äô produced at Covent Garden on 2 February 1792. Other English operas by Mazzinghi were: ‚ÄòA Day in Turkey,‚Äô 1791; ‚ÄòThe Wife of Two Husbands,‚Äô 1803; ‚ÄòThe Exile,‚Äô the Covent Garden company acting at the Opera House, 1808; ‚ÄòFree Knights,‚Äô with the popular duet, ‚ÄòWhen a little farm we keep,‚Äô 1810; and in collaboration with Reeve, who wrote the lighter airs, ‚ÄòRamah Droog,‚Äô 1798; ‚ÄòThe Turnpike Gate,‚Äô 1799; ‚ÄòPaul and Virginia,‚Äô 1800; ‚ÄòThe Blind Girl,‚Äô 1801; and ‚ÄòChains of the Heart,‚Äô which gave much pleasure to George III, 1802. Mazzinghi's concertanti were played at the Professional Concerts (Pohl, Haydn in London), and his miscellaneous compositions were popular, especially those for the pianoforte. He taught the pianoforte to many influential pupils, among them the Princess of Wales, afterwards Queen Caroline. He was entrusted with the arrangement of the concerts at Carlton House, and of the Nobility concerts, established in 1791, and held on Sunday evenings at private houses. For fifty- six years Mazzinghi was a member of the Royal Society of Musicians. In about 1790 he entered into partnership with the firm of Goulding, D'Almaine, & Co., who published all his music after that date. Visiting Italy in 1834, Mazzinghi recovered the title of count. On his return to England he retired to Bath. He died on 15 January 1844, at Downside College, where he had been on a visit to his son. He was buried with some pomp in the vault of the Chelsea catholic church on 25 January. Works Besides the stage-pieces mentioned above, Mazzinghi published between seventy and eighty pianoforte sonatas; upwards of two hundred airs, &c.;, for pianoforte, and as many for harp and other instruments; thirty-five or more vocal trios, of which ‚ÄòThe Wreath‚Äô is still remembered; and a number of songs. A full list of his music is given in the ‚ÄòDictionary of Musicians,‚Äô 1827. Much of this mass of work, produced with apparent ease, was musicianly; but the flowing melodies were seldom strikingly original.

Blair Hedges and Sudhir Kumar, now at Temple University, for presenting times of divergence in the tree of life. The basic concept has been to produce and present a community consensus of the timetree of life from published studies, now numbering 2,687, and allow easy access to that information, on the web or mobile device. Although the database currently permits searching for average node times between two species or higher taxa, the TimeTree web site indicates that other features such as browsing the timetree of life will be available in 2016. TimeTree has been used in public education to conceptualize the evolution of life, such as in high school settings. The original development of TimeTree dates to the late 1990s, with initial support from NASA Astrobiology Institute. Since then it has been supported by additional grants from NASA, and by NSF and NIH. Features TimeTree users can search for the names of two species, such as cat and dog, to obtain the mean and median time estimates for their divergence, in millions of years. The results also show all individual time estimates, from each study, next to a geologic timescale, indicating geologic periods. Separately, a table lists the time estimates, downloadable as a spreadsheet, from each study along with references and links to the abstracts of the original articles. The database also allows search of timetree articles by author name. The entire book Timetree of Life is also presented on the site.

While previously incorporated in Bermuda, Kosmos has reincorporated in Delaware. The company holds production and development operations offshore Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, and Gulf of Mexico, while holding a development project offshore Mauritania and Senegal, and exploration licenses offshore Namibia, S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe and Suriname. It was previously involved in exploration offshore Morocco and Western Sahara. It discovered the Jubilee oil field off the coast of Ghana and the cross-border Tortue gas field offshore Mauritania and Senegal. Kosmos was the focus of a documentary Big Men that followed the company as it worked to establish the Jubilee oil field in Ghana. History Kosmos Energy was established in 2003 by founding partners James C. Musselman, Brian F. Maxted, W. Greg Dunlevy, and Paul Dailly. Initial backing came from American private equity firms Warburg Pincus and The Blackstone Group. Originally, it was incorporated in Bermuda. Kosmos made one of the world's largest recent oil discoveries in June 2007, off the coast of Ghana. The company discovered the Jubilee Oil Field about offshore. The first oil from the field was produced in 2010. The company and its operations in Ghana, around the time of the Jubilee discovery and work to develop the field, was the focus of Rachel Boynton's 2013 documentary-film Big Men. The documentary was shortened and adapted into a BBC television documentary Storyville: Power, Money, Greed and Oil. Kosmos went public under the ticker symbol KOS on the New York Stock Exchange on May 10, 2011. The initial public offering raised more than anticipated, selling 33 million shares at $18 each. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange on August 21, 2017. Kosmos and Chevron reached a deal in June 2012, where subsidiary Chevron Global Energy Inc. received a 50% working interest in Block 45 and Block 42 in Suriname, to boost operations. In May 2016, Kosmos reached a farm-out agreement with a subsidiary of Hess Corp., wherein Hess acquired a 33% non-operated interest in Block 42 from Kosmos and Chevron. Kosmos began a controversial oil drilling project in the Cap Boujdour area in 2014 off the coast of the disputed territory of Western Sahara. In an article from February 2015, former UN legal counsel Hans Corell stated that exploration activities by Kosmos and Glencore were in violation of the legal opinion he wrote for the UN Security Council. Kosmos responded that its operations complied with international law and were consistent with the UN opinion. Kosmos officials also told media it recognized that its work in the area must occur alongside UN-led mediation. The company said local populations in Western Sahara would benefit from the economic development of the region. A Kosmos official told Reuters, \\"If we are successful, we believe responsible resource development has the potential to create significant social and economic benefits for Western Sahara and its people. We have worked in close partnership with Morocco ‚Äî as the de facto administering power of the territory. They have a vital role to play in ensuring benefit sharing, among other important issues, will happen should we be successful\\". In 2016, Norway's Council on Ethics recommended that the country's Government Pension Fund Global exclude Kosmos Energy and Cairn Energy Plc. from its investment portfolio due to their activities in Western Sahara. In June 2016, the Financial Times quoted Kosmos correspondence with the Council on Ethics: \\"We fundamentally disagree with the council's assessment of our activities offshore Western Sahara, where we have spent considerable time on the ground working with local people to understand their views of oil and gas exploration. The council's decision fails to recognize that people in Western Sahara‚Äîwhom we have met in hundreds of face-to-face conversations‚Äîwant the economic opportunities that come from increased foreign investment.\\" In February 2018, Kosmos announced its withdrawal from Morocco and Western Sahara, marking the end of 17 years of companies in the oil sector there. Kosmos made two significant gas discoveries offshore Mauritania in 2015. Kosmos discovered gas at its Tortue-1 exploration well in Block C-8 in April 2015, followed by another gas discovery in its Marsouin-1 exploration well, which was later renamed Bir Allah, in the northern part of Block C-8. A few kilometers south of Tortue-1, Kosmos Energy discovered gas at its Guembeul-1 exploration well offshore Senegal in January 2016. The company continued to make gas discoveries in 2016 and 2017, including significant natural gas resources at the Teranga-1 exploration well offshore Senegal in 2016. In December 2016, Kosmos and BP entered a partnership in Mauritania and Senegal. BP acquired a 62% working interest, including operatorship, of Kosmos' exploration blocks in Mauritania and a 32.49% effective working interest in Kosmos' Senegal exploration blocks. In May 2017, the two companies made a major discovery off the coast of Senegal while drilling the Yakaar-1 exploration well. Senegal and Mauritania signed a cooperation agreement to allow for Kosmos and BP to develop gas resources shared by the two counties in February 2018. BP and Kosmos made a final investment decision on the Tortue project in December 2018, leading to the first phase of the Tortue LNG development. Kosmos Energy acquired Deep Gulf Energy, expanding Kosmos' oil and gas operations into the Gulf of Mexico, in August 2018. In December 2018, Kosmos was reincorporated in Delaware. Previously, it was incorporated in Bermuda. Operations Kosmos Energy produces oil in Equatorial Guinea, Ghana and the Gulf of Mexico, in the partnership with BP develops Greater Tortue in Mauritania and Senegal, and carries out exploration activities in Cote d'Ivoire, Namibia, Sao Tome and Principe, South Africa and Suriname. Previously it operated also in Morocco and Western Sahara but has ended its operations there. =Ghana= Kosmos Energy discovered the Jubilee Oil Field in 2007. It owns a 24.1% stake in Jubilee Oil Field. The field is estimated to hold up to of oil and of natural gas. , the Jubilee field produces about of oil. United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reportedly advocated for Kosmos and other U.S.-based oil companies in Ghana as Kosmos began development of the Jubilee field. In addition to Jubilee, Kosmos is a partner on the TEN (Tweneboa, Enyenra and Ntomme) project developing the Tweneboa, Enyenra, and Ntomme hydrocarbon accumulations. Kosmos holds a 17% stake in the TEN, which sits approximately off the coast of Ghana. Oil first flowed from TEN in 2016. =Equatorial Guinea= In October 2017, Kosmos entered a 50:50 joint venture with Trident Energy to acquire Hess Corporation's interest in the Ceiba Field and Okume Complex assets offshore Equatorial Guinea. Kosmos also has interests in exploration blocks offshore Equatorial Guinea. In November 2019, Kosmos announced an oil discovery at its S-5 well offshore of Equatorial Guinea. =Gulf of Mexico= Kosmos Energy entered the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in August 2018 when it acquired Deep Gulf Energy from First Reserve, a private equity firm, for $1.23 billion. Kosmos Energy paid $925 million in cash and $300 million in common stock to acquire DGE. As a result, Kosmos Energy increased its daily production by more than 50% to 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent; estimated reserves increased 40% to 280 million barrels of oil equivalent. =Mauritania and Senegal= Kosmos operates in the Cayar and St. Louis blocks offshore Senegal. It holds a 32.51% interest in each of its two exploration licenses. In Mauritania, Kosmos holds 28% stakes in four blocks. It made a significant gas discovery at its Tortue-1 well in Block C-8, offshore Mauritania, in April 2015. The well was drilled to test the Tortue West prospect, forming a part of the Greater Tortue complex. Its next discovery offshore came at Kosmos' Marsouin-1 exploration well, later renamed Bir Allah, in the northern part of Block C-8. With results from its Ahmeyim-2 appraisal well, Kosmos estimated the Tortue West contains of gas, and the Greater Tortue Complex contains more than . Company officials said this discovery confirmed that the Tortue gas resource, which is also called Ahmeyim, straddles the maritime boundary between Senegal and Mauritania. At the end of 2018, Kosmos Energy announced a final investment decision for phase 1 of the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim LNG Project alongside BP. In October 2019, Kosmos made a major gas discovery at its Orca-1 exploration well offshore Mauritania. The company estimated the total gas available as 50 trillion cubic feet of gas. Kosmos and BP have a farm-out agreement over the joint gas discovery in Mauritania and Senegal, as well as future exploration. Under the deal, Kosmos focuses on exploration, while BP controls development and production operations. The two companies have discovered an estimated of gross Pmean gas resource at the Yakaar-1 exploration well. At the end of 2018, Kosmos Energy announced a final investment decision for phase 1 of the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim LNG Project alongside BP. In September 2019, Kosmos Energy confirmed gas resources at the Yakaar-2 appraisal well. =Suriname= In Suriname, Kosmos operates in two exploration license areas. It holds a 50% interest in Block 45 and a 33% interest in Block 42. In 2018, it abandoned two exploration wells, Anapai-1A in Block 45 and Pontoenoe-1 in Block 42, because the company failed to find hydrocarbons. =Morocco and Western Sahara= As operator, Kosmos held a 55% interest of the Boujdour Maritime block and 75% interest of the Essaouira block. In October 2013, Kosmos reached a farm-out deal with Cairn Energy subsidiary Capricorn Exploration & Development Company Ltd. Under the deal, Cairn took a 20% non-operated interest in Boujdour Maritime block. The license of the Boujdour block was signed with the Moroccan state oil company ONHYM. Kosmos announced in May 2014 it would plug and abandon its FA-1 well in the Foum Assaka Offshore block. While it did not find oil, the company said there was evidence of a working petroleum system and the well provided important seismic calibration details. These details were incorporated into the company's petroleum system analysis. On March 2, 2015, Kosmos Energy said its CB-1 exploration well in Cap Boujdour made a small discovery. The discovery was noncommercial, and the well was plugged and abandoned in February 2018. =Other African countries= Kosmos has ownership interests in six blocks offshore Sao Tome and Principe, including two blocks where Kosmos partners with BP. In 2018, Kosmos announced it would explore a number of blocks offshore with Royal Dutch Shell. With Galp, Kosmos ordered a 3D seismic survey of a large stretch of ocean floor. According to The Wall Street Journal, the survey was \\"one of the biggest offshore oil exploration efforts of its kind in the region\\". The survey was completed on August 20, 2017. Kosmos Energy has an offshore license in Congo-Brazzaville for the Marine XXI block, which covers more than 2,300 square km. Kosmos Energy signed a production sharing agreement with Congo-Brazzaville and the Soci√©t√© Nationale des P√©troles du Congo. In 2018, Kosmos Energy partnered with Royal Dutch Shell to explore blocks offshore Namibia. Corporate affairs Kosmos Energy is headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and incorporated in Delaware. It trades on the New York and London stock exchanges under the ticker symbol KOS and, as of 2018, employed about 380 workers globally. =Governance= The company is governed by a board of directors. Its executive leadership includes chairman and CEO Andrew G. Inglis, Chief Exploration Officer Tracey Henderson, and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Thomas P. Chambers. =Other initiatives= In Dallas, Kosmos gave $450,000 to the Perot Museum of Nature and Science, creating the Kosmos Energy STEM Teacher Institute Kosmos also supports the Dallas Museum of Art. It is the presenting sponsor of the Keir Collection of Islamic Art. In Ghana, the company established the Kosmos Innovation Center in 2016, offering entrepreneurship programs to help diversify Ghana's economy, including the agriculture industry specifically. Among the center's projects is the AgriTech Challenge, which invites young innovators to develop programs to develop commercial agriculture in Ghana. In 2017, the AgriTech Challenge attracted 400 participants. In addition, Kosmos has worked with the Safe Water Network to provide residents in Western Ghana with access to clean water. The company has partnered with an NGO, Le Partenariat, to sponsor programs in Senegal to improve the environment. In 2018, Kosmos Innovation Center launched a start-up accelerator program in Senegal. Kosmos donated $67,500 worth of equipment to Polytechnic College of Suriname in 2016, to be used in its undergraduate Mechanical Engineering and Infrastructure programs. In 2017, the company donated $56,600 worth of equipment for students studying mineral production at Anton de Kom University of Suriname. Kosmos has worked with international security company Safe Start to develop and deliver a safety training program for technical schools in the country.

History =Beginnings= The group's history begins in 1962 near the ruins of Howth Abbey, when it was founded by Abbey Tavern owner Minnie Scott-Lennon, who decided to add a sing-along music attraction to her establishment. The idea was immediately successful, and as the group became locally popular an album was released on Pye Records in 1965. =We're off to Dublin in the Green= A song entitled \\"We're off to Dublin in the Green\\" was used by Carling Breweries Ltd in an international television advertising campaign. The song is an IRA marching song dating back to approximately 1916. Using the soundtrack from the commercial, the song was released on Canada's ARC Records and became extremely popular in Canada, reaching No. 2 on Canada's CHUM Charts and selling close to 150,000 copies in Canada within the first year of release. It was a surprise hit, partly because of the poor sound quality of the soundtrack, partly because of the song's ties to the IRA, and partly because of its association with an alcoholic beverage. It was also released in the United States, on Hanna-Barbera Records where it charted on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 94 staying for two weeks and on the \\"Easy Listening\\" charts at No. 40. \\"Off to Dublin in the Green\\" spent five weeks on the Cashbox Top 100 chart, with a peak at number 68. Not wanting to take sides politically, the B-side was a song of the Orangemen, \\"Captain of the Gallant Forty Twa,\\" which was also featured in beer commercials. Carling Black Label reported increased market share following the release of the advertising campaign and the song's subsequent popularity. Because it was the best selling Irish record in Canada, Mrs. Scott-Lennon was presented with a Trophee International Midem. =Popularity and international touring= In response to the popularity of \\"Off to Dublin\\", albums were also released, containing material recorded entirely at the Abbey Tavern in Ireland. The group stayed on the ARC label for Canadian albums, but oddly were placed with Berry Gordy's V.I.P. Records in the United States. Demand for live appearances became so strong in North America that a tour was conducted there in 1967. These concerts maintained the informal atmosphere of the tavern performances. This tour was lengthy, so their third Canadian album \\"Abbey Tavern Singers on Tour\\" was recorded in a Canadian studio instead of at the Abbey Tavern. =Return to the Abbey Tavern= When the folk-music craze died out, the Abbey Tavern Singers eventually quit their touring, and again became the house attraction at their namesake tavern. On an intermittent basis they continued to travel internationally for special occasions such as St. Patrick's Day. The group's successors were still advertised as performing at the Abbey Tavern in Dublin as of 2013. Performance style At the peak of their popularity the group was classified as folk music. The Abbey Tavern Singers intended to create a relaxed, informal atmosphere reminiscent of the original tavern performances. In the middle of a concert stage, this did not always come off as well has hoped. Partly this was because the Singers had not developed a stage act, and were known to appear disinterested when not participating in a given number. While their performances of some songs such as \\"This Land Is Your Land\\" were noted for their energy, performances of other songs were panned as maudlin. The group was positively cited for their lack of gimmicks when performing. Although the group name indicated a vocal ensemble, they were praised for their instrumental work in concerts. At one time this included the only full-time Irish spoon player, PJ Downes, who exclusively used Irish nickel-silver spoons for performing, and was known to place tours on hold if the right spoons were unavailable to him Their set lengths were noted for their generosity. In addition to concerts, the Singers would also participate in folk masses while on tour. Influence and legacy ARC Records made special trips to Ireland in hopes of discovering new Irish talent in hopes of duplicating the success of the Abbey Tavern Singers. The popularity of \\"We're off to Dublin in the Green\\" inspired several cover versions, not all of which were appreciated by the Abbey Tavern Singers.

It has been called the smallest Swabian unit of measurement and plays a similar role in northern Baden-W√ºrttemberg and Franconia. The term Muggeseggele has an iconic character and is one of the most preferred Swabian idioms. In a 2009 readers' survey by Stuttgarter Nachrichten, the largest newspaper in Stuttgart, Muggeseggele was chosen as \\"the most beautiful Swabian word\\" by a large margin.  Etymology  The Swabian term for housefly is Mugg. This is akin to M√ºcke, the standard German word for mosquito. According to linguist Hans-Martin Gauger, the second element in the word Muggeseggele corresponds to the standard German S√§ckel, meaning little sack; the term, therefore, must have originally referred to the scrotum, like the Latin cognate saccellus. This second element in the word occurs independently in Swabian German as Seckel, which is used as a swear word and is thus a rare instance of a sexually themed abusive word in the German language, which mostly uses scatological swearing. In the case of Muggeseggele, the sexual and abusive aspect is not at all present. On the contrary, it is mostly used to express a very small but distinctive distance or amount of substance, as in \\"the soup needs a Muggeseggele of parsley\\". It can be used in speaking to children and is deemed completely harmless (compare Bubenspitzle). It is used in the TV series Ein Fall f√ºr B.A.R.Z., which takes place in Fellbach. German's public broadcaster SWR's children's website SWR Kindernetz (kids' network) mention the word in a Swabian dictionary that presents some peculiarities of the Swabian dialect to their young audience. Kindernetz uses the sentence A muggeseggele Zeit h√§tten wir noch! and translates it as Ein bisschen Zeit h√§tten wir noch, meaning \\"We still have a tiny bit of time left\\".Swabian dictionary at website of S√ºdwestrundfunk Ein Fall f√ºr B.A.R.Z.  Cultural importance and particular instances of usage Wolfgang Wulz, president of the Verein Schw√§bische Mundart (Association of the Swabian Tongue), has praised Muggeseggele and L√§lleb√§bbel as prominent examples of distinctive and admirable Swabian expressions. Both foreign and German immigrants to Baden- W√ºrttemberg tend to include some of the specific dialect expressions in the course of speaking. They often do not adapt to the dialect, but show their desire to integrate into the local community by adopting key regional vocabulary. Muggeseggele is one of the words deemed funny and distinctive and used in that way as part of a cultural code. A cookery book honoring the relationship between the twinned cities of Karlsruhe and Halle contains a small glossary of Saxon and Alemannic words, including Muggeseggele. An article in S√ºddeutsche Zeitung quoted Thomas Lindner, CEO of textile machinery company Groz-Beckert in Albstadt-Ebingen and Speaker of Verband Deutscher Maschinen- und Anlagenbau (VDMA) and the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Reutlingen, as saying: \\"At our Indian premises, everybody knows what a muggaseggele is\\". Groz-Beckert is a leading company in the production of textile needles and the term Muggeseggele is therefore used to stress exactitude and diligence as well as Swabian cultural influence throughout the company. The term is used as an example of must-know Swabian vocabulary in courses of Swabian as a foreign language in T√ºbingen. The same applies for lectures and books written in Swabian. While Muggeseggele has often been used to refer simply to an extremely small measure, actual measurements of fly penises by an entomologist at the Naturkundemuseum in Stuttgart gave an average length of . \\\\- Online as jpg  English equivalents  A gnat's cock or a gnat's dick is a similar construction in the English language, but it has a more irreverent or obscene aspect.

In simplest terms, a nabkha is a sand dune that forms around vegetation. It is an aeolian landform, a structure built and shaped by the action of wind. Nabkhas are common and occur in many regions. Well known nabkha fields occur in the Arabian Desert of Kuwait, the Hotan River Basin in Xinjiang, China,Wu, S., et al. (2008).

In the Chihuahuan Desert they include soaptree (Yucca elata), creosote (Larrea tridentata), and atriplex (Atriplex spp.). In China nabkhas form quite often around Caragana microphylla, as well as Cleistogenes squarrosa, Leymus chinensis, Caragana stenophylla, Stipa grandis, and S. glareosa,Wang, X., et al. (2006).

In Jal Az-Zor National Park in Kuwait, they occur around Nitraria retusa, Zygophyllum qatarense, Haloxylon salicornicum, and Panicum turgidum. Halophytes such as Tamarix aucheriana, Halocnemum strobilaceum and Salicornia europaea have nabkhas in saline soils, while Cyperus conglomeratus, Rhanterium epapposum, Astragalus spinosus, Lycium shawii, and Citrulus colocynthis are seen in non-saline zones.Al-Dousari, A. M., et al. (2008). Characteristics of nabkhas in relation to dominant perennial plant species in Kuwait. Kuwait Journal of Science 35(1). On the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt they are recorded on Artemisia monosperma, Moltkiopsis ciliata, Calligonum polygonoides, Stipagrostis scoparia, and Retama raetam.El‚ÄêBana, M. I., et al. (2007). Role of host identity in effects of phytogenic mounds on plant assemblages and species richness on coastal arid dunes. Journal of Vegetation Science 18(5) 635-44. In central Asia and surrounding areas they occur on Calotropis, Ziziphus, Salvadora, and Heliotropium species.Cooke, R. U., et al. Desert Geomorphology. Taylor & Francis. 1993. pg. 357. A nabkha is variable in size and shape. The typical example is a steep mound with a flat top. The larger nabkhas of the Chihuahuan Desert reach about 4.3 meters tall by 40 meters wide. The largest known were 10 meters tallMilich, L. Dunes. Arid Lands Resource Sciences. The University of Arizona. Tucson. 1998. and a kilometer long; these large dunes have been called mega-nabkhas. Mega-nabkhas in various places have also been called precipitation ridges, bordering dune ridges, and in Dutch, randwallen. Sometimes only the tips of the branches of the plant within protrude from the sand, and sometimes the plant is completely engulfed.Saqqa, W. and M. Atallah. (2004). Characterization of the aeolian terrain facies in Wadi Araba Desert, southwestern Jordan. Geomorphology 62(1) 63-87. Nabkhas may join together and form broad, hilly dune fields, or more often, chains and scattered dune patches. The sand composition is also variable. Silt and clay pellets can be part of the dune. Nabkhas in the Namib Desert are rich in sediment. On the Kuwaiti coastline nabkhas form around Nitraria retusa growing on sabkhas, a form of salt pan. These dunes are composed of quartz, gypsum, and feldspar sands mixed with bits of volcanic rock and calcite grains. Fragments of mollusc shell and oolites can be found. Traces of garnet, zircon, topaz, and tourmaline occur. Dolomite is common. Coastal nabkhas can be eroded by saltwater, and even washed away completely, leaving the plant behind. The type of plant influences the shape of the nabkha; for example, treasure flower (Gazania rigens) forms tall, conical or elongated dunes, while beach daisy (Arctotheca populifolia) forms shorter, semi-circular dunes.Hesp, P. and A. McLachlan. (2000). Morphology, dynamics, ecology and fauna of Arctotheca populifolia and Gazania rigens nabkha dunes. Journal of Arid Environments 44(2) 155-72. Retama raetam is a salinity-tolerant woody shrub that can extend roots up to 20 meters deep in the soil, persisting through harsh conditions and eventually building nabkhas up to 8 meters wide. A plant generally cannot hold enough sand to start a nabkha until it is at least 10 centimeters tall.Mares, M. A. Encyclopedia of Deserts. University of Oklahoma Press. 1999. pg. 189.Ahmed, M. M., et al. (2009). Chemical and morphological characteristics of phytogenic mounds (nabkhas) in Kuwait. Arab Gulf Journal of Scientific Research 27(3) 114-26. Some sources describe nabkhas as ephemeral features of the landscape, but other research shows that they may last longer than previously thought. Some last over 100 years. Still, a nabkha on an annual plant generally only lasts one season. A nabkha can also be self- limiting if the sand accumulation lifts the plant far enough out of the water table that it dies. Ecology Nabkhas are common features in landscapes that are undergoing desertification. In North America, a characteristic sign of desertification is the spread of mesquites (Prosopis spp.) into the habitat. Mesquites rapidly accumulate windblown sand, forming nabkhas. In northern China, nabkhas were present on grasslands before they were converted to agriculture, but this conversion accelerated their development and they are a common feature of abandoned farm fields in the region. They are indicators of soil erosion there. Nabkhas develop their own ecosystems. They are home to a variety of animals, including many invertebrates such as nematodes and the sand flea Talochestria capensis. The dune tends to have more organic material than the surrounding sand, as windblown plant matter accumulates in it and the roots of the plant penetrate it. In degraded and oil-polluted desert areas in Kuwait, plants with nabkhas act as ecosystem engineers, hosting a sheltered site with layers of relatively rich soil in which other plants can grow. Nabkhas on nitrogen-fixing plants like legumes can have elevated nitrogen levels and other nutrients that other plants can use. The dunes can become islands of plant diversity in otherwise poor habitat. Etymology Nabkha is an Arabic word that has been in use for at least 14 centuries. It translates roughly to \\"small, sandy hillock\\". References Category:Dunes Category:Arabic words and phrases ","title":"Nabkha"},{"id":"39769309","text":"Shauna L.

Completed in 1929, it served as the university's main library until 1984. Today, it houses several special collections. The dome rises 85 feet over the university's South Quadrangle.  History  The library was constructed between 1927 and 1929 at the far end of the South Quadrangle at a time of rapid growth for the university. Twenty-three buildings were constructed on the UNC campus between 1920 and 1931. Architect Arthur Cleveland Nash, together with William Kendall of famed firm McKim, Mead, and White, designed the neo-classical building in the Beaux-arts style. The building follows the standard plan of Carnegie libraries across the United States. In 1923, the Carnegie Corporation reported having no objection to the university building a new library and converting the 1907 Carnegie-funded library to other uses. However, the university did not apply for library construction funds in 1924 for the new building. Wilson Library was named for Louis Round Wilson, the university's first librarian, in 1956. Prior to the renaming, the building had been referred to as \\"the library.\\" Wilson had campaigned for a new library building for most of the 1920s, wanting a building that would house enough books to make it a library of national distinction. Ten days after the building opened on October 19, 1929, the stock market crashed. State support for the university dropped, which meant that Wilson had to raise money for the library through private donations and foundation support. Some of the gifts donated during the Depression created some of the library's most notable collections. The original building was 219 feet long and 140 feet deep. The first addition was added in 1952, with two more in 1976 and 1984. It served as the university's main library until 1984, when Davis Library opened. Today, Wilson Library mainly serves as a special collection library. Its North Carolina Collection is the largest about a single state in the United States.  Collections  *Rare Book Collection - The Rare Book Collections began in 1929 and now contains over 200,000 printed materials, as well as original graphics, medieval and Renaissance manuscripts, and literary and historical papers. *Southern Historical Collection - Established in 1930, the Southern Historical Collection documents the American South through its more than 15 million items and 4,600 discrete collections. *North Carolina Collection - Created in 1930, the North Carolina Collection is the largest collection in existence documenting a single state. *University Archives - UARMS collects, preserves, and provides access to the records of the University of North Carolina. *Southern Folklife Collection - The Southern Folklife Collection opened in 1989 and documents vernacular music, art, and culture related to the American South.

In 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, Lau declared that no one should touch or kiss mezuzot, in order to prevent further spread of the virus. Published works Lau has published articles in journals such as Tehumin and edited a book of his father's responsa titled Yichil Yisrael. He also edited and published a book in memory of his grandfather, Yitzchak Yedidya Frankel. In 2008, he published his book Maskil LeDavid on issues of genealogy, conversion, military law, and other matters. Controversy Lau affixing a mezuzah at the CHAJ centre in The Hague, 2016 Lau took a semikhah (rabbinic ordination) test in 1993. Dov Lior, the administering rabbi, asserted that Lau brought papers with answers to previous tests into the exam room. Lau denied the allegations but he was disqualified. He was retested in 1994 and passed the exam. In his first week in office as Chief Rabbi of Israel, Lau referred to African-Americans who play basketball on Israeli teams as kushim. Although in a biblical context it refers to the ancient Kingdom of Kush, it is currently considered a derogatory term for Black people. Ethiopian-born MK Pnina Tamanu-Shata called his comment racist. In August 2019, Lau instructed the chevra kadisha to delay the burial in Jerusalem of the mother of an American Haredi man, Yisrael Meir Kin, until he agreed to give his wife a gett (religious writ of divorce). Kin's relatives in Israel deposited $20,000 with the Supreme Rabbinical Court and signed a document pledging to do what they could to convince him. Kin accused Lau of corruption and said that no one from Lau's office had contacted him. He said that the divorce papers had been filed ten years earlier at a religious court in Monsey, New York, and Lau, who was related to his wife, had taken sides in the case. A relative of Lau denied that he was related, but Haaretz determined that they are in fact related, though distantly. Lau‚Äôs office responded to Kin's statements, saying that the chief rabbi was not aware of the family relation while dealing with the case, and that they were sorry that Kin, who had denied his wife a gett \\"for more than 15 years\\" was \\"continuing his refusal despite the agreements reached... [Lau] will continue his unwavering war on the phenomenon of get-refusal and \\"will do everything he can, including [imposing] the most severe sanctions, to end any case of get-refusal that may develop.\\" Officials in the Ministry of Religious Services said the chief rabbi has no jurisdiction over burial matters. In 2018, Lau was accused of trying to appoint his brother-in-law Mordechai Ralbag as a replacement for a rabbinical judge who was investigating corruption involving hekdeshot (Haredi non-profit property trusts). Lau and the Ralbag family denied any wrongdoing.

Wilson (May 5, 1869 - January 7, 1948)Baton Rouge Morning Advocate, January 8, 1948 was a Democratic politician from Tangipahoa Parish, one of the Florida Parishes of southeastern Louisiana, who served from 1916 until his death as the Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry. He was the father of the humorist and chef Justin E. Wilson. Background Of Welsh descent, Wilson was a son of Dr. and Mrs. William D. Wilson. In 1856, Dr. Wilson had built a store in Independence, Louisiana, which remained for years the oldest building in the community. Harry Wilson worked in the parish seat of Amite in the general store of the merchant Jacob Stern at a time when Tangipahoa Parish did not yet depend on the strawberry crop. During the 1890s, Wilson was an express messenger for the Illinois Central Railroad. He left that position to pursue a political career. Political career Affectionately known by voters as \\"Uncle Harry\\" or \\"Mister Harry\\", Wilson served two nonconsecutive terms in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1900 to 1904 and again from 1908 to 1912. Representative Wilson led the move to establish Independence, located five miles south of Amite, as a town. In 1902 and 1903, he corresponded with Governor William Wright Heard regarding incorporation of the community, which at the time had a population of 308. Governor Heard informed Wilson that he considered the three square miles proposed for the new town too much land for a small village and suggested that the tract be reduced. Originally named \\"Uncle Sam\\", Independence had begun in 1852 when the New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern Railroad began operating through the area. Independence was finally proclaimed a town on August 22, 1912. When Ruffin Pleasant of Shreveport was elected governor in 1916, voters also chose Wilson as agriculture commissioner, a position to which he was reelected to seven times. Under Wilson, the agriculture department established the Market Bulletin, a newspaper that allowed landowners and farmers a means by which to purchase and sell agriculture-related goods and services. Wilson developed the department's seed laboratory and increased the emphasis on entomology. Later, a full-time entomologist, Sidney McCrory of Ascension Parish, was hired; McCrory was elected for a single four-year term as agriculture commissioner in 1956. Wilson established an agricultural museum in the basement of the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge. For twenty-two years Wilson was the chairman of the Southern Commissioners of Agriculture Association. Wilson was an organizer of the Cotton Consumption Council and a president of the interest group with an unusual name, the Association for the Increased Use of Cotton. On June 19, 1933, U.S. Representative Bolivar Edwards Kemp, Sr., of Louisiana's 6th congressional district, died unexpectedly of a heart attack at his home in Amite. His seat ordinarily would have been filled through a special primary and general election. Governor Oscar K. Allen waited until December 1933 to declare that a special election would be held eight days from the date of his announcement. Allen named Kemp's widow, the former Esther Edwards Conner, known as \\"Lallie\\" Kemp, as the \\"unopposed\\" Democratic nominee. Many protested Allen's announcement, and ballots were destroyed or burned in several locations within the district. After state election officials nevertheless declared Lallie Kemp the winner of the special election, a committee of citizens staged a \\"revolt election\\", won by Jared Y. Sanders, Jr., of Baton Rouge, the son of former Governor Jared Y. Sanders, Sr., and supported by district conservatives and anti-Long elements. In January 1934, Mrs. Kemp and Sanders presented their competing claims to the U. S. House. The United States House Committee on Elections refused to seat either candidate, and the full House concurred by voice vote. Lallie Kemp declined to run in the subsequent May 1, 1934, special election. It is unclear why Governor Allen waited so long to call the first special election, which led to even greater delay became of the controversy over the guidelines for the election. In the special election, Sanders defeated Kemp's replacement candidate, Agriculture Commissioner Harry Wilson. In the 1940 state elections, Wilson won while running on the Earl Kemp Long ticket. He defeated Charles O'Brien, the candidate supported by Sam H. Jones, who unseated Long in the gubernatorial runoff contest that year.Minden Herald, January 12, 1940, p. 5 Lallie Kemp, who died in 1943, was appointed in 1937 by Governor Richard Leche to the Louisiana Hospital Board. She is honored by the naming of the medical center, a critical access hospital, in Independence. Legacy Wilson took much comfort in his roots in his hometown of Independence. On his death bed in the Our Lady of the Lake Hospital in Baton Rouge, he regained consciousness after a week in a coma and told his nurse, \\"Turn me toward Tangipahoa...\\" A genealogical website indicates that Wilson did not die in Baton Rouge but in Amite; if so, he must have been released from the hospital and sent home for his final few days. Wilson was succeeded in the office on an interim basis by his long-term assistant, Millard Perkins, who did not seek the position in the 1948 election instead won by W. E. Anderson, also of Tangipahoa Parish. Anderson died in office in 1952 before he could begin his second elected term. Andedrson was succeeded by Dave L. Pearce of Oak Grove in West Carroll Parish, originally appointed to the vacancy by Governor Earl Long. Justin Wilson, the best known of the Wilson children, was the second youngest of four daughters and three sons of Harry Wilson and his wife, the former Olivette Mintern Toadvin (1880-1976), who was of French descent and known as Olivet Wilson. Justin was born in Roseland near Amite. Justin's older sister, Minette Wilson Kemp, was the wife of Bolivar Edwards Kemp, Jr., the state attorney general from 1948 to 1952. It was his mother, an expert in the improvisation of meals, who taught Justin how to cook. Olivet Wilson was also a composer and pianist of instrumental music who was still performing on occasion into her nineties. Harry Wilson is interred at Amite Cemetery. alongside his wife. Justin Wilson is interred at the Saint William Catholic Cemetery in Port Vincent in Livingston Parish.

While the regions on both sides of the river were socially and culturally interconnected, the distinct political destinies of both territories resulted in different settlement patterns. The majority of Moldova is in Bessarabia, which lies east of the Dniester and was part of Moldavia. Today's Transnistria, the region west of that river, was part of Podolia in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and later the Russian Empire. Bessarabia =Beginnings= Map of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania between 1386 and 1434 showing the Principality of Moldavia as a Polish fief. The beginnings of Polish influence in Bessarabia can be traced back to the 14th century with the founding of the Principality of Moldavia. Trade between the Baltic and Black Seas between the two neighboring countries facilitated their growing bond. During this era Moldavia was a vassal state of first the Kingdom of Poland and later the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth several times Marcin Kosienkowski, \\"Polska a Mo≈Çdawia i Naddniestrze\\" Although the border along the Dniester river was socially porous, with substantial intermarriage and cultural exchange between the Moldavian nobility with Polish szlachta and Ukrainian elites, there was an absence of significant Polish settlement in Bessarabia at that time. =Catholic missionary activity from Poland= This connection to Poland was compounded by the attempts to bring Moldavia into the Roman Catholic Church which predate the principality's founding. Franciscan and Dominican missionaries created several Latin Catholic communities in present-day Romania starting in the 13th century CE. The Holy See decided to created bishoprics, south and east of the Carpathian mountains in Wallachia and Moldavia. Catholicism was attractive among the traditionally Orthodox population due to the political late 14th century context, as the Ottoman Empire advanced into Europe. With Constantinople encircled to a large degree after the conquest of (H)Adrianopolis, (now Edirne), in 1360, the Byzantine emperors sought a political and hopefully military ally in the Catholic west, which had crusaded against Islam to and in the Middle East before. Bogdan I followed the same example, and thanks to it obtained virtual independence in 1359 as the founding voivode (autonomous prince) of Moldavia. Seeking aid and protection from Poland, Bogdan welcomed the Latin missionaries. A Franciscan monastery was founded at Siret in 1340 and the Diocese of Siret followed in 1371. The diocese came to fruition after Bogdan's son La»õcu of Moldavia (1365-1373) invited a delegation from Rome, promising his and his subject's conversion to Catholicism and asked Pope Urban V to send missionaries and erect a Latin diocese in his principality's capital, Siret. On 24 July 1370 the Pope instructed the archbishop of Prague and bishops of Bratislava and Krak√≥w (Cracovia) to verify/complete the sincerity of La≈£cu (although his wife remained Orthodox) and mandated them to erect such diocese covering the Moldavian state. After Pope Gregory XI established the diocese, Polish Franciscan Andrzej Jastrzebiec was consecrated first Bishop by archbishop Florian Mokrski of Cracow. The cathedral, dedicated to John the Baptist, was built by queen Margareth, Catholic kin of the Hungarian royal family, which in 1377 had invited Dominicans to Siret. However prince La≈£cu favoring of Catholicism met grave opposition from the Orthodox clergy, while effective Latin converts were concentrated in the north of Moldavia, near Catholic neighbour kingdoms Poland and Hungary. Since 1372, when Andrzej was nominated Apostolic administrator of the Archdiocese of Halyƒç, probably never returning to Siret, he and his (all Polish) successors resided more in Poland then in Moldavia. In 1388 prince Petru (Peter) II \\"Mu≈üat\\" (1375‚Äì1391) transferred the Moldavian voivode's capital from Siret to Suceava, thus contributing to the crisis in the diocese of Siret, now abandoned by both crown and episcopate. =Polish fiefdom= Petru made maintaining a good relationship with Poland a priority. On 27 September 1387 at Lw√≥w, he paid homage to the Polish king W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, making Moldavia a Polish fief which it remained until 1497. Despite thwarting the nascent Roman Catholic Church in Moldavia, Petru made maintaining a good relationship with Poland a priority. On 27 September 1387 at Lw√≥w, he paid homage to the Polish king W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, making Moldavia a Polish fief (which it remained until 1497). Petru's second marriage in 1388 was to Olga, daughter of Janusz I, Prince of Masovia with whom he had a son, Iva»ôcu. . Even after the influence of the Ottoman Empire grew in Moldavia and the Balkans, Poles continued to be very involved in the affairs of its neighbor until the Polish Partitions end in 1795. =Incorporation into the Russian Empire= Several waves of political and economic migration bring Poles to start settling in Bessarabia beginning in the 18th century. These include fugitive serfs, the defeated forces of the dethroned Polish King Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski's march to Bendery, and later defeated insurgents of the Ko≈õciuszko Uprising all looking for shelter across the border from Poland. The chaos surrounding the Partitions of Poland also contributed to this process. Polish migration into this area later increased after Bessarabia's incorporation into the Russian Empire, which included substantial numbers of Jews from Poland. Over the 19th century, the Russian authorities encouraged the colonization of Bessarabia by Romanians, Russians, Ukrainians, Germans, Bulgarians, Poles, and Gagauzes, primarily in the northern and southern areas vacated by Turks and Nogai Tatar, the latter having been expelled in the 1770s and 1780s, during Russo-Turkish Wars;Vasile Baican, \\"Human settlements in Moldavia represented on \\"the Russian map\\" between 1828‚Äì1829\\", Scientific Annals of \\"Alexandru Ioan Cuza\\" University of Iasi ‚Äì Geography series the inclusion of the province in the Pale of Settlement also allowed the immigration of more Jews. The Romanian proportion of the population decreased from an estimated 86% in 1816,Ion Nistor, Istoria Bassarabiei, CernƒÉu»õi, 1921 to around 52% in 1905. Flavius Solomon, Die Republik Moldau und ihre Minderheiten (L√§nderlexikon), in: Ethnodoc-Datenbank f√ºr Minderheitenforschung in S√ºdostosteuropa, p. 52 During this time there were anti-Semitic riots, leading to an exodus of thousands of Jews to the United States. Transnistria Map illustrating the location of Brac≈Çaw Voivodeship in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. There is a lack of clarity as to whether Transnistria was part of Kievan Rus' beginning in the 11th Century, and if so, to what degree. After the disintegration of Kievan Rus' because of the Mongol Invasions, this area came under the rule of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 15th century as part of Podolia. Much of Transnistria remained a part of Brac≈Çaw Voivodeship in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth until the Second Partition of Poland in 1793. In 1504 the Crimean Khanate conquered the southernmost portion of Transnistria south of the Iagorl√Æc/Jagorlyk river along with the rest of the Yedisan region which remained under the control of the Ottoman Empire until 1792. Thus the border between the two states was set on the Iagorl√Æc river, referred to as the Iahurl√Æc in Moldavian chronicles, Sava, p.5 and in Polish source as Jahorlik or Jahor≈Çyk[Geographical_Dictionary_of_the_Kingdom_of_Poland], 1880‚Äì1902, b.III p.372 http://dir.icm.edu.pl/pl/Slownik_geograficzny/Tom_III/372 =Polish colonization= Map from 1772 CE illustrating settlements along the border between Brac≈Çaw Voivodeship in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Crimean Khanate, and the Principality of Moldavia. Because of the massive slave raids and invasions launched by the Crimean Khanate, much of the southern region of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was sparsely populated. To remedy this, the 16th and 17th centuries Polish kings, in particular Stephen B√°thory and Sigismund III Vasa, sponsored large-scale Polish colonization of Podolia, which includes the territories of modern Transnistria. Polish magnates were given large tracts of sparsely settled lands, while Polish petty gentry managed the estates and served as soldiers. Serfs were enticed to move into these territories by a temporary 20 year exemption from serfdom. Although most serfs were from western Ukrainian lands, a significant number of Polish serfs from central Poland also settled these estates. The latter tended to assimilate into Ukrainian society and some of them even took part in the Cossack uprisings against the landlords. Polish magnates from Ukraine played a significant political and social role within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, as did the native nobility in these areas which Polonized over time. Polish rule at this time involved the expansion of Jesuit schools and large scale construction of ornate castles and estates that included libraries, art collections, and archives that in many cases were the equal in importance to those in Poland itself. By the late 18th century, approximately 11% of the population were Roman Catholics, most of them Poles. Poles in Ukraine.

Timothy Snyder. The Reconstruction of Nations. New Haven: Yale University Press Poles included wealthy magnates with large estates, poorer nobles who worked as administrators or soldiers, and peasants. Long after this region ceased being a part of Poland, Poles continued to play an important role in both the province and in the city of Kiev. Until the failed Polish insurrection of 1830-1831, Polish continued to be the administrative language in education, government and the courts. Poles in Ukraine.

The Polish magnates prospered under the Russian Empire, at the expense of the serfs and of the poorer Polish nobility whom they pushed from the land. The wealthy magnates tended to oppose the Polish insurrections, identified with their Russian landlord peers, and often moved to St. Petersburg. The Polish national movement in Ukrainian lands thus tended to be led by members of the middle and poorer gentry, who formed secret societies in places with large Polish populations. Poles in Ukraine.

These Polish nobles, legally reduced to the status of peasants, often assimilated into the Ukrainian language and culture.

The area that would become Transnistria was organized into the Ukrainian SSR in 1919, under which the Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was created in 1924. Under Stalinist rule, the Polish community would decline further. After a brief initial period of liberalization and freedom towards Poles in the Soviet Union were subject to harassment, dispersal and mass terror. This trend increased in the late 1930s, as a result of the 1937-8 Polish Operation of the NKVD as well as the ceasing of educational instruction in the Moldavian ASSR for all non-Romanians populations in their native languages which was replaced by Ukrainian and Russian. Unification of Bessarabian and Transnistrian Moldova On August 2, 1940, the Soviet Union established the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (Moldavian SSR), which consisted of six counties of Bessarabia joined with the westernmost part of what had been the MASSR,Charles King, The Moldovans: Romania, Russia, and the politics of culture, Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, 2000. . effectively dissolving it. From this point forward until the beginning of the Transnistria War in 1990 and the establishment of a breakaway state, the Polish Community in Moldova was under one polity. =After World War II until the collapse of the USSR= The number of Poles in all of the regions within the former Soviet Union has been steadily decreasing over the past century. To a large extent this decline can be traced due to policies of Sovietization which aimed to destroy Polish culture in the USSR. Knowledge about the Polish Community in Moldova was completely absent in Poland throughout the entire postward period until the collapse of the USSR. This trend was only reversed in the 1990s when Polish researchers gained the ability to conduct research in Moldova.\\"Narodziny czy odrodzenie?

Some publications of Polonia activists and Polish diplomats mention numbers of up to 20,000 of Poles in Moldova, -- numbers significantly exceeding that of self-identified Poles in the census. Some authors include in their estimates people of Polish descent, while others assume people of Catholic faith (in a predominantly Eastern Orthodox country) are most probably of Polish descent; and this may include, e.g. Ukrainians with ties to Poland in their ancestry. As a consequence of the Russian and Soviet policies towards Polish culture, only a small percentage of Poles in Moldova today speak Polish. For example, Petru Lucinschi (, who served as the second President of Moldova carries a transcribed version of the Polish surname ≈Åuczy≈Ñski, but has never publicly identified with a Polish heritage. Some Transnistrian politicians such as former First Lady Nina Shtanski and Yevgeni Zubov are open about their Polish roots.

He was the founder and from November 1992 to May 2011 editor-in-chief and publisher of the German magazine '. Since August 2011 he has been working as communication expert for banks and industries such as The Royal Bank of Scotland, BASF SE, and BRAIN AG. Early life and career Deichmann studied Civil Engineering at TU Darmstadt. In 1992, after earlier political activities, he began to work as an editor and journalist, writing first about international relations and then increasingly about issues to do with the natural sciences and their role in society. Bosnia Deichmann received international attention when his article on the civil war in the former Yugoslavia (first in German, then in English and other languages), \\"The picture that fooled the world\\", was published by British magazine LM, in February 1997, claiming that a frequently published image from August 1992 was faked. He claimed that the ITN footage, created in front of Trnopolje concentration camp, featuring prominently group of emaciated Bosnian Muslim men prisoners, and among them Fikret Aliƒá, standing behind a barbed wire fence, was deliberately staged to portray a Nazi-style extermination camp, that the British reporters from ITN, Penny Marshall and Ian Williams, had actually stood inside a compound surrounded by a barbed wire fence and from there filmed their famous pictures, and went on to allege: \\"It was not a prison, and certainly not a 'concentration camp', but a collection center for refugees, many of whom went there seeking safety and could leave again if they wished\\". However, an examination of the substance of this case by a professor David Campbell of cultural and political geography at Durham University showed that the key claims made by Deichmann and LM are \\"erroneous and flawed\\". In February 2000, the publishers of LM, Informinc (LM) Ltd., were sued for libel by ITN at the British High Court in London. At the beginning of his summation, High Court Judge Morland defined what the libel case was about: ‚ÄúMembers of the jury, you may well think that in a democratic society it is vital that journalists are fearless, investigative reporters. It is, you may well think, of the utmost importance that they are accurate and fair reporters. It is right that one journalist, if he considers that another journalist has been inaccurate, unfair and misleading, should say so. But this case, you may think, is not about whether Penny Marshall and Ian Williams have been inaccurate, unfair or misleading; the nub of this case is whether the defendants have established that Penny Marshall and Ian Williams have deliberately ‚Äì I emphasize that word, 'deliberately‚Äô ‚Äì compiled misleading television footage.‚Äô‚Äù LM could not prove such a deliberate mistake and lost the case.BBC News: ITN wins Bosnian war libel case In March 2000 the magazine was forced to close, after defendants failed to present any evidence in their defense. Reporters Penny Marshall and Ian Williams were each awarded ¬£150,000 over the LM story and the magazine was ordered to pay ¬£75,000 for libelling ITN in a February 1997 article.\\"ITN wins Bosnian war libel case\\". BBC News. 15 March 2000 Professor David Campbell of Durham University summarised his study of the case as follows: > [A]s strange as existing British libel law is, it had an important and > surprisingly beneficial effect in the case of ITN vs LM. The LM defendants > and Thomas Deichmann were properly represented at the trial and were able to > lay out all the details of their claim that the ITN reporters had > \\"deliberately misrepresented\\" the situation at Trnopolje.

He also appeared as an expert witness for the defence of the Bosnian Serb soldier Du≈°ko Tadiƒá during the first case of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in 1994. Writings on Green and science issues Since the late 1990s Deichmann‚Äôs journalistic focus shifted increasingly to the role played by green NGOs. For example, he blamed Greenpeace for running campaigns against Green Biotechnology that lacked scientific proof.Thomas Deichmann: Just how ‚Äòcharitable‚Äô is Greenpeace? In 2009, Deichmann received the InnoPlanta Journalism Award for his coverage of Plant Biotechnology. With Detlev Ganten and Thilo Spahl he published the book \\"Die Steinzeit steckt uns in den Knochen\\" (The Stone Ages is still in our bones), which was voted German Science Book of the Year in 2010. His articles and writings have appeared in numerous countries and have been translated into a number of languages. Newspapers and magazines that carried his journalism include Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Die Welt, Financial Times, Cicero (Germany), Spiked (UK), Der Standard (Austria), Die Weltwoche (Switzerland), Mediterranean Quarterly (US). Deichmann is the author of several books published by Suhrkamp Verlag, Eichborn Verlag, Deutscher Taschenbuch Verlag (dtv) and Piper Verlag. In recent years, Deichmann has criticised the tendency to moralise International Relations. Another subject of his writing has been the growing influence of green ideas, something he calls ‚ÄúEcologism‚Äù, as well as Consumer Protection policies ‚Äì developments he views as symptoms of a deep-seated social misanthropy, of governments that lack any vision of the future and thus promote fear and a nanny state. Deichmann calls himself a ‚ÄúFuture Optimist.‚Äù Other activities Deichmann was active as a speaker, coach, and chair for a number of institutions, including the European Science Open Forum Munich, Cologne Institut for Media Studies, Henri Nannen Journalism School Berlin, Free University Berlin, Battle of Ideas London, F.A.Z.-Institut Frankfurt, Ludwig von Mises Institute Brussels, and the German Institute for Public Affairs Berlin. He also worked as an evaluator of research applications for the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research and as an expert for the Committee for Education, Science and Technology of the German Parliament. Since 1997, Deichmann has travelled frequently to the Balkans with Austrian writer Peter Handke. He has organised photo exhibitions about these trips and also written about them.Thomas Deichmann: Literatur und Reisen mit Peter Handke  References   Publications / Bibliography  *Thomas Deichmann: \\"Germany and the politics of resignation\\", Spiked online, 2 June 2010 *Thomas Deichmann: \\"The Schmeiser story\\", Spiked online, 10 October 2002     External links  * *LinkedIn *NovoArgumente Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt alumni Category:German male journalists Category:German journalists Category:German science writers Category:German male writers Category:BASF people Category:Bosnian Genocide deniers ","title":"Thomas Deichmann"},{"id":"39769917","text":"The John Leak Monument is located off Huish Drive, in Victoria Park, Rockhampton, Queensland, Australia.

While most of the site has been dismantled, the Southport Cable Hut remains and has been listed on the Queensland Heritage Register and the Gold Coast Local Heritage Register. Early telegraphy in Australia Telegraph communication developed in the mid-19th century as a result of many years of discovery and experimentation in electrical communication culminating in the work of Samuel Morse. The rapid long distance communication provided by telegraph systems had a major impact on society. The telegraph was quickly utilised by news services; Associated Press and Reuters press service were founded to take advantage of the technology. Telegraph companies soon offered financial services, providing the facility to send money orders via the telegraph. In Australia the telegraph helped to alleviate the isolation of the colonies. New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia were connected by telegraph by 1860. Queensland's first telegraph connection was made in 1861 between Brisbane and Ipswich. Brisbane was linked to Sydney the same year. The first telegraph link between Australia and Britain opened in 1872. The link was via the Eastern Cable Company's network. It was routed through Singapore, India, Suez and Gibraltar. It was initially proposed to make landfall in north Queensland. However, the South Australian government successfully negotiated for the link to connect with Adelaide via Port Darwin and an overland route through the centre of Australia. Before the Pacific Cable was opened, the Eastern Cable Company and its associates maintained a monopoly over international telegraph traffic with Australia. As a result, the cost of communication between Britain and Australia remained very high and beyond the means of most people. Planning and construction Sandford Fleming, Chief Engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway, was an early advocate of an alternative cable route between Australia and Great Britain via Canada and the Pacific Ocean. He expressed his views as early as the Colonial Conference of 1887. A major advantage put forward by Fleming and other proponents of the Pacific route was that it would be more secure in times of war. The existing link passed through countries that were not part of the British Empire. The high cost of telegrams through the Eastern Cable Company's system provided further motivation for a competing route. The proposed Pacific Cable would break the Eastern Cable Company's monopoly and lower the cost of communication between Britain and Australia. When the Pacific Cable opened, the cost of telegrams reduced to less than half the former rate. The ability to communicate directly with the United States and so access more trade opportunities was another argument in favour of the Pacific Cable. It was proposed that the Pacific Cable would pass only through British dependencies. Approval was given at the Postal and Telegraphic Conference held in Brisbane in 1893. By the mid-1890s, agreement was reached that the cable should be laid. However debate about management of the cable laying project and ownership of the completed cable continued for some years. Finally, it was agreed that funding should be shared between the governments of Britain, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. The Pacific Cable Board was formed in 1896 with representatives from Britain, Canada and Australia. A survey of the route from Vancouver began in 1899. The Pacific Cable Act (1901) gave this board responsibility for managing the project and operating the completed cable. The Imperial Court passed the Pacific Cable Act in 1902 authorizing the construction of the cable link between Australia and New Zealand, to the United Kingdom via Canada.Notes taken from Mr Frank Surman April 1997. David Anderson, from A.B.C. Rockhampton taped Mr Surman's account to broadcast on 29 April 1997. The site of the cable station in Southport was selected by R. E. Peake who was a member of Clarke, Ford and Taylor, the engineering firm responsible for the overall project and tasked with drawing up the plans and specifications of the cable station. Peake arrived in Australia in April 1901 to establish a location for the cable terminus in Australia and, on 30 May 1901, he visited Southport with the Acting Deputy Postmaster General, T. C. Scott. At the same time, a temporary cable station that had been previously constructed in England and dismantled for shipment to Australia was transported to Southport on the Maid of Sker and erected in the beach at Southport to act as a test house and temporary buildings for the equipment. At the end of July it was reported that a three-acre two rood site bordered by Bauer Street, Chester Terrace and Lenneberg Street had been selected for the station buildings. An additional eight-acre site bounded by Brighton Parade and the Nerang River was acquired for the cable landing. In late 1901 the commonwealth government called for tenders to construct three buildings, including a central building housing the cable and land lines, with facilities for staff, and two separate houses to accommodate the cable superintendent and the land line superintendent. In April 1902, the tender was awarded to E Boyle to construct the wooden buildings within six months for a sum of ¬£4,574 within. By the end of 1902, it was reported that the building to house the cable and land lines was near completion and the instruments housed in the test house on the beach were about to be relocated. The houses to accommodate the superintendents were not as well advanced. The cable station officially opened on 4 November 1902. Cable laying The route selected for the cable linked Southport, Norfolk Island, Fiji, Fanning Island, and Vancouver Island. A branch connected to New Zealand. Since cartographers of the day traditionally coloured member countries of the British Empire in red, the route became known as the All Red Route. Cable laying started in 1902 with two ships, Anglica and Colonia. They began laying cable from Bamfield, Vancouver Island, Canada, to Fanning Island, Suva, Norfolk Island and Southport, Queensland, Australia. Colonia, built specifically for the project, laid cable from Vancouver Island to Fanning Island in the mid-Pacific. Anglia laid cable from Southport to Norfolk Island, Fiji, New Zealand and Fanning Island. The Cable Station landfall was at Main Beach, Cable Street passing under the river to the station at Bauer St, Southport. The cable was landed at Southport in March 1902. The Pacific Cable was completed on 31 October 1902 and officially opened at Southport on 3 November 1902 by the Postmaster-General of Australia, the Honourable James Drake; the total cost was around 2 million pounds sterling. The cable was laid into a trench through the dunes of Narrow Neck near Southport and terminated at a cable hut located close to the beach. From here, it connected to a cable which crossed under the Nerang River to the cable station at Bauer Street. Use The first message was sent on 31 October and opened for the public on 7th 1902. It was opened to public traffic on 8 December 1902. Until 1912 Southport handled telegraph traffic for all over Australia. In 1912, a cable from Auckland was extended to Sydney and for a period after this, traffic for the southern States went directly to Sydney from Auckland. There was only one serious interruption to the service during World War I, in 1914 when the Nurnberg, a German cruiser, cut the cable at Fanning Island. Technical changes to the system in 1923, including the installation of automatic repeaters, relegated Southport to a repeater station. The Southport station continued to be operated by the Pacific Cable Board until 1932. Management was then taken over by Cable & Wireless. During World War II, following the raid on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese in December 1941, the Australian authorities, aware of the importance of the cable as the only link Australia had with the United Kingdom other than the Overland Telegraph and Middle East Route, straddling potentially hostile countries and aware of the possibility of enemy action, declared that schools in the Southport area should not open at the beginning of 1942. Some schools were evacuated to country areas. Following success in the Battle of the Coral Sea, it was felt this part of the country was safe from invasion. In 1946 the Australian Government passed the Overseas Telecommunications Act, passing responsibility of the cable from the Pacific Cable Board to the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (OTC). In October 1962, the Commonwealth Pacific Cable System (COMPAC) cable between Sydney and Vancouver was completed. The original Pacific Cable was thus rendered redundant and the Southport to Norfolk Island cable was closed. The Cable Station at Bauer Street was sold to De La Salle Brothers who operated a community youth centre there. In 1964 the property was sold to the de la Salle Brothers. Some of the equipment was used by the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, The Royal Society, R.A.N. and C.I.S.R.O. Cable Hut Southport Cable Hut is a heritage-listed former telegraph station at Cable Park, Main Beach Parade, Main Beach, Gold Coast City, Queensland, Australia. The brick hut was the Australian terminal of the Pacific cable. By January 1950, the original cable hut located close to the beach at Narrow Neck had gone, leaving only a cement slab and a flag pole partly surrounded by a barbed wire fence. It is believed that it was destroyed in a severe storm. Serious erosion of the cable reserve by February 1951 threatened these remains and the cable connections located there. The current brick hut located at Cable Park was built during the first half of 1951 to remedy this situation. =Site description= Plaque adjacent to hut, 2015 Cable Park is a small grassy reserve located on Main Beach Parade at Main Beach at the Gold Coast. The Cable Hut is a small brick structure set well back from Main Beach Parade in the park. The hut is about square in plan view and about high. There are no windows, airflow being provided by ventilator bricks. It has a flat concrete roof. A plain wooden door, secured by a barrel bolt and padlock, is centered in the northern wall. A section of submarine cable is mounted on the eastern wall above a rectangular brass plaque. The interior of the hut is unlined and has a wooden floor. The pine skirting boards are of recent construction. Fastened to the wall opposite the door are three groups of cables passing through the floor. These cables run vertically up the wall and are held in place by a long wooden beam extending the length of the wall. The beam is fastened to the brickwork by bolts. The group at the eastern end of the wall comprises two thick black cables. The outer insulating material of each cable has been removed to a length of about one metre from the end. An inner armoured sheath has been folded back over the outer insulation to expose another layer of insulation. This has been removed to expose three insulated wires. The wires are fixed to the wall on a block of wood. At the opposite end of the wall is a group of three cables. The insulation and sheathing on one of these cables has been removed in a similar way to the cables mentioned previously. However, only a short length of insulation has been removed from the other two cables. The third group of cables comprises two grey cables, one considerably thinner than the other. These pass through the floor between the two outer groups about an equal distance from each. The larger of the two cables is fixed with a metal saddle to a rectangular piece of wood fastened to the wall. Just above this, the cable enters a red, rectangular metal box bolted to the wall. About fourteen smaller grey cables emerge from the top of this box; they are fixed to the wall by a bracket. Above this, twelve of the cables turn and run horizontally to the east, over two rusted metal brackets. Six of the cables are draped over these brackets and hang towards the floor. The other six run further to the left to a point immediately above the two thick cables at the eastern end of the wall. At this point, they turn towards the floor meeting the two cables coming up from the floor. They are fastened to the wall on a block of wood. Immediately to the west of the red metal box is a wooden panel fixed to the wall. Mounted on this is a large, brass pressure gauge. The thinner of the two grey cables which emerge from the floor is fitted into the bottom of this gauge. Two of the cables which come out of the top of the red metal box turn to the west and curve downwards around the bottom of the wooden panel to enter the gauge at approximately the 'two o'clock' position. A paved path runs from the eastern side of the hut towards a large raised circular platform. This has an aggregate top and set into this is a round metal plaque. Depicted on the plaque is a map of the world showing the route of the Pacific Cable. Shrubs and palm trees grow in a small garden bed around the hut. A garden bed of shrubbery runs along the southern and western border of the park. =Heritage listing= The cable hut was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 May 2007. It was described as having met the following criteria: *The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Southport Cable Hut () is important in demonstrating the evolution of Queensland's history insofar that it marks the Australian terminal of the Pacific Cable, Australia's second telegraph link with Great Britain and the first to be government owned. Known as the All Red Route, the Pacific Cable was also the first link between Australia and Britain to pass only through countries of the British empire, by convention coloured red on world maps. The opening of the Pacific Cable in 1902 was an important step forward in international communications for Australia since it resulted in faster, more secure and much more affordable communications between Britain and Australia. *The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Cable Hut is the only surviving structure associated with the Southport terminal of the Pacific Cable that remains in its original location. Buildings of the former, nearby Cable Station, where communications were received and sent through the Pacific Cable, are extant but have been moved from their original location to the Southport School. *The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of cable huts; small buildings where submarine telegraph cables were linked to their terrestrial counterparts. The Southport cable hut is a small, functional structure of simple, robust design. Fastened to the rear wall inside the hut are the ends of the Pacific Cable, the cable link to Sydney and the link to the Cable Station formerly located at Bauer Street, Southport. A gauge and equipment for maintaining gas pressure in the cable to Bauer Street also remain extant in the hut.  Current use of buildings  In the early 1980s the De La Salle Brothers decided to redevelop the area and the Cable Station buildings were removed. Two of the buildings were located to The Southport School where they continue to function as music rooms. There was a long association between the school and the cable station. C. E. Goff was in charge of the Cable Station trainees, and Mr T. C. Judd an early superintendent encouraged sporting contests between the school and the Cable Station. The major prize for Senior Mathematics was named the Goff Prize in honor and recognition of C. E. Goff. The buildings were divided into 12 sections and moved to The Southport School. Ron Burling, the school architect, re-erected the buildings. The building was reopened at The Southport School on 12 September 1982. The National Trust listed the building because of its historical and architectural significance. In 1983 The Southport School was awarded the John Herbert Award for the relocation and sympathetic restoration of these historic buildings. The buildings are currently being used by The Southport School as their music department and are listed on the Gold Coast Local Heritage Register.

It was one of a number of early plantations which pioneered the region's sugar industry.  History  = John Stevens = Ageston plantation was established on the south bank of the Logan River by John Stevens in 1866. John Stevens was born in Maine, USA, and came to Australia in 1835, involving himself in squatting and then cotton and sugar cultivation.The Brisbane Courier 21 February 1871, p. 4. Ageston was selected under the Regulations for the Cultivation of Sugar and Coffee of 1864 and 1866, and later brought under the Crown Lands Act of 1868. The original Ageston holding comprised a 320-acre block (Portion 2) of native forest and swamp. Fifty acres of cotton was grown, but following a poor yield Stevens turned to sugarcane, planting out 60 acres. A comfortable house set within gardens and orchards was built upon a hill that was the highest point on the estate. Like most of the sugar estates of the district, Ageston depended heavily on indentured South Sea Island labour. In November 1868 the plantation relied wholly on the labour of eight South Sea Islanders who managed two bullock teams and four horses, and this workforce was expected to increase when the cane had to be harvested. There was a horse- drawn mill to crush the cane and a wharf enabled steamers to regularly collect the sugar for market and bring in supplies. Despite the soil largely being white, impoverished sand eroding from a sandstone substrate, the plantation proved highly productive, mostly because of the excellent drainage and presence of aquifers and springs. The plantation was also among the most favourably situated in the district, having a north easterly aspect, and being close enough to the mouth of the river to receive a mild coastal climate that mitigated against frost and extremes of heat but still being adequately sheltered. In 1868 a correspondent for The Brisbane Courier visited the site and described the various improvements made: > A good split-rail fence had been erected round the cultivation. There are > also six pig paddocks, of about two acres each, close paled (occupied by > nearly sixty pigs), and the garden has been considerably enlarged. A new > cotton shed had been built, which is to be turned into a tobacco shed > eventually-a small patch of which is being tried, and a large kitchen next > the house has also been finished. A stable for six horses is in course of > erection. I noticed that the garden is kept in first rate order, and it is > not too much to say that it is not only the largest, but the most orderly > and comprehensive I have seen in tho district. I saw coffee, chicory, and > earth nuts, near the common European garden produce of beans, peas, onions, > and carrots, all looking well, whilst the large hedges of passion fruit were > loaded, and the grapes, of several varieties, without any symptom of > disease.

Other observations at this time were: John Stevens died in February 1871 and the estate went to auction. Prior to his death, and possibly in response to failing health, title to the lease was transferred to Joseph Baynes of Brisbane in May 1870. The advertisement for the sale notes that at this time the property comprised 641 acres, a lease having been taken out in 1869 on an adjoining 320-acre block to the east. Seventy acres were under cane and there were 200 acres of fenced paddocks, a horse mill with improvements by Smellie & Co., a stable (45 feet by 15 feet), a sugar store (50 feet by 15 feet), two huts for workers, and a weatherboard house of seven rooms with 2 acres of garden planted with coffee, orange, lemon, peach and other trees and flowers. There was also the spring, which supplied both the mill and the house. It was further noted that steamers and other craft from Brisbane passed on a daily basis and that the labour on the estate was carried out solely by experienced South Sea Islanders. Additional information on the plantation is provided by the Census of 1871, which identifies that there were 10 inhabited buildings and 30 people (27 men and 3 women). = William Couldery = The plantation was sold to William Henry Couldery of Gympie in 1871. London born, William Henry immigrated to Australia as a young man due to a respiratory illness, and on regaining his health undertook pastoral pursuits in New South Wales and Queensland before arriving in Gympie in 1868. On the recently proclaimed goldfield he became renowned as an innovator, introducing new technology such as electric lighting and modern mining machinery. He owned or had shares in a number of goldmines and profited from the Gympie gold rush, becoming the first chairman of the Gympie Divisional Board and taking positions on many other local institutions. In 1872 he married Susanna Geddes of Caboulture and by the following year had started a family, with the birth of a daughter, Beatrice, at his Gympie residence, Warlingham Villa. The Couldreys had three more children, Reginald Hall (b. 1875), Victor Carlton (b. 1881) and Dorothy Rosamund (b. approx. 1896). William Couldery did not initially take up residence at Ageston, remaining instead in Gympie to oversee his interests there. Like many plantations, Ageston was run by a manager, the first being William Mune. To abide by the terms of the lease, William Mune lived on site as Couldery‚Äôs bailiffe. In 1879 a man named John Quinn also acted with Mune as bailiffe for the estate. The original survey plans for the estate note that a deed was never issued for Stevens‚Äô second block, and this may have been the catalyst for a resurvey and new lease application in 1871 which created a larger block of 492 acres (Portion 249). The bulk of this land was low-lying swamp and salt marsh partially inundated by the spring tides. The total size of the plantation was now 792 acres. In June 1871 two bullock teams were required to draw fencing for about 140 chains, and in April 1872 tenders were being called for grubbing, clearing and ploughing 30 acres of land. In 1873 the amount of land under cane extended to about ninety acres. The Bourbon cane was the variety principally grown as it suited the forest soil best, but other varieties, such as ribbon cane, were also present. Operations were also modernised, with the now outdated horse mill being replaced by one of the finest steam driven mills in the Moreton district. A wooden railway conveyed the cane to the mill, which incorporated the district‚Äôs the first vacuum pan. This innovation was significant as it represented a major step in improving the region‚Äôs sugar industry, which at the time was using a variety of primitive techniques and patented processes which often resulted in sugar of poor or inconsistent quality. The vacuum pan heated sugarcane juice in a partial vacuum, reducing its boiling point and so allowing much greater fuel efficiency than the open kettle system then in use. It was also safer for the operators. The vacuum pan was eventually adopted in sugar refining, escalating production and reducing the price of product. The original Ageston selection (Portion 2) was converted to freehold in 1876 following the required 10 years of rent payments and property improvements. This year was also marked by Couldery winning first prize at the Exhibition of the Southern Queensland Agricultural Society for sugar produced by vacuum pan from ribbon and Bourbon cane, and over successive years continued to win prizes for his sugar. Ageston sugar was also shown at the New South Wales Intercolonial Exhibition of 1877. Often Ageston represented the only entry in the vacuum pan class. For a number of years Ageston remained the only plantation in the region to use the vacuum pan, all other manufacturers using open pans. The mill at Beenleigh did not get a vacuum pan until 1878. A detailed description of the Ageston mill was given in 1873. It was noted that the site of the mill was on a gentle rise from the river, with the roads and tramway from the field converging on the upper side of the building. The shed covering the principal portion of the machinery was estimated at 120 feet long by 36 feet wide, with side wings for the engine, mill, and clarifiers on the one hand, and the necessary stores and offices on the other. Once delivered to the mill, the cane was crushed by rollers that were 86 inches long by 80 inches diameter. The waste, bagasse (also called megass), was used in a number of ways: fuel for the boilers, consumed by the plantation‚Äôs horses, or carried off by a truck on the wooden railway to a portion of low ground here it was partially composted before being returned to the fields as fertiliser. The juice from the cane was gravity fed into steam-jacketed clarifiers supplied by waste steam from the engine; then after being tempered and clarified, it was allowed to run into the battery which consisted of three large east iron pans and ‚Äòdouble teach‚Äô of copper. The concentrated liquor was raised in a copper dipper by windlass, and run into cisterns, from which it was passed into the well of the vacuum pan. This pan was a closed vessel, from which the air was extracted by means of a steam engine and air pump; it was 6 feet in diameter and made of cast iron lined with copper. It boiled the liquid at 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The stage and pan were supported by cast iron pillars, and for the security of the attendant the stage was surmounted by an iron railing. The air pump was driven by 12 horsepower engine. At the finish the contents were discharged by a valve into a receiver below and then into the centrifugals. The centrifugals were by Manlove and Alliott, of Birmingham, and were driven by the vacuum-pan engine by way of a gearing system. Once the manufacturing process was complete, the sugar was transferred to the store alongside the mill, where it was bagged and made ready for shipment. The engines, pan, and clarifiers were supplied with steam by two large boilers fitted with Galloway tubes (one to each plate) and the necessary draught obtained by a chimney seventy feet in height. There were also tramways for the supply of firewood to the furnaces, and for moving cane to the mill or sugar to the wharf. All of the machinery, except the centrifugals, were manufactured by J. Walker and Co., of the Union Foundry, Maryborough. The general management of the plant was by Mr Strachan, an engineer with experience working and erecting sugar machinery. The expertise and new technology injected into the mill greatly increase efficiency and quality of the product, with the sugar valued at ¬£40 per ton. In 1874 William Mune oversaw another expansion phase, calling for tenders to clear and grub 100 acres in lots of 5 to 20 acres. Under William Mune, trials and experiments in sugar processing were undertaken, with the Gill process (which used electricity in the clarification) being selected by late 1877. In 1876 the mill complex was described as extensive and close to the river, and it included a large distillery. Ageston also had its own bond store, cooperage and government customs officer, who was accommodated on site. Although William Couldery resided in Gympie and was registered as a freeholder there on the Queensland electoral roll until 1891, he was also registered as a leaseholder, and then freeholder, at Ageston in the roll for the Logan Electoral District through to 1904/5. He appeared to have a close involvement in the management of the estate and did periodically visit it. It was during such a visit, in 1875, that the office at the manager‚Äôs house was struck by lightning not longer after the occupants had finished dinner. The lightning ignited a batch of newspapers in the office, and the flames spread to a bed and the calico lining of the room. William Couldery saved the building by throwing the burning materials outside into the rain. The account of the incident provides an insight into the spatial arrangement and domestic life of the house, referring to the presence of women and children, including a servant girl and a baby belonging to Mune. In addition to an office, the house had a dining room and a sitting room. William Couldery had his own bedroom within the residence, while the customs official slept in the office, the bed that was burned being his. Turning sugarcane juice or molasses, a by-product of the sugar making process, into rum was an important economic sideline of many of the local mills. Not all the distilleries were licensed and already noted there was considerable illegal trade in black market alcohol. Ageston was one of the legitimate producers, obtaining its first distillers licence in 1877, and in the early 1880s the distillery was in fact the only legal one in the district. Ageston rum was of high quality, winning prizes and praise at agricultural exhibitions. The distillery also produced a fine quality Hollands gin. In August 1878 the still collapsed, causing ¬£16 worth of damage, and William Mune prosecuted the distiller, Julius Woolf, in the Beenleigh court, believing that the man had been negligent with the apparatus. The growing importance of the plantation and its distillery warranted the appointment of John McMahon as an inspector of distilleries in January 1880. John McMahon resided at Ageston. He was replaced by James Brown in 1883, who had previously been stationed on Yengarrie plantation in Maryborough. James remained at Ageston until his retirement in 1890. In 1880, while boring for water, a seam of coal was discovered at a depth of 250 feet. Although this find elicited some excited commentary from the press, nothing came of it, and there was no serious exploitation of the resource. Of greater importance was finding a source of good clay on the estate - this led to the establishment by 1883 of a brickworks using an English brick making machine which produced three types of bricks (common, fancy and firebricks), as well tiles and drain-pipes. These were of sufficient quality to win prizes at exhibitions, and be sold on the Brisbane market and as far as Gympie Ageston bricks were valued as furnace linings because of their ability to withstand 6000 degrees Fahrenheit. A crucial improvement to the plantation was the introduction of a drainage scheme. By 1879 2000 chains of open drainage and floodgates had been installed. Portion 249 also had approximately 100 acres of land that been cleared, stumped and planted with cane, 100 chains of two rail fence and 50 chains of tramway. By 1881 the drainage system had transformed much of the swampland into productive canefields. As well as open drains, the system also comprised a levee bank along the Logan River and closed drains of terracotta pipes manufactured on the plantation. In 1881 William Mune resigned and W.M.C Hickson took over as manager. He was at Ageston until 1884/5 when he moved to Bundaberg to take charge of Rubyana plantation, which had been purchased by a syndicate in which he was a member. There were discussions to replace him with his brother, John Hickson, and this may have come to pass as a Mr Hickson is mentioned in connection with the management of Ageston late in 1885, and in that year a son was born to AJ Hickson and his wife at Ageston. If the brother did work at Ageston it was only for a period of months, as no Hickson is recorded at Ageston in the Queensland electoral role for Logan after 1885. At its height in the early 1880s, the estate employed up to 40 South Sea Islanders. Only a little is known of how Ageston‚Äôs Melanesian workforce was treated or where they resided. Given the estate‚Äôs close involvement with colonial authorities via its resident inspector, it is doubtful that mistreatment was countenanced. However it had the typical paternalistic power structure of a plantation, and the few reports available suggest that the Islanders working the estate experienced many of the same conditions and stresses that their fellows on other estates in the district faced. They were employed to clear land, dig drains and other earthworks, build fences, cultivate and haul cane and work bullocks and horses. They were also engaged at the mill, although legislation introduced in the 1880s excluded them from skilled or technical work; however, there were still various menial occupations available at the plant. Historical references indicate that they lived in small huts rather than communal barracks, kept small livestock, used a form of pigeon English to communicate with the manager, and probably grew various familiar vegetable foods such as taro. At times there were disputes between different Islanders on the estate, as well as friction with the estate management. In 1872, for example, five South Sea Islanders, named Samango, Wakoolich, Gope, Haline, and Susum, were brought up on a charge of deserting from the hired service of William Couldery, and ordered to be sent to the Beenleigh Bench. A couple of years later, in 1874, tensions between Islanders erupted when a man named Kapp (Gapp) was tried, and acquitted, for the manslaughter of another South Sea Islander named Watumah, who was employed to haul cane from the wharf to the mill. Although Ageston was one of the more advanced and profitable plantations in the district, it was not immune to the growing problems within the industry and in 1884, faced with the low price of sugar and the difficulty in sourcing labour, William Couldery made the decision to gradually phase out sugar production and move into general farming and horse breeding. This year was also marked by personal tragedy with the death of daughter Beatrice. On reviewing operations on the estate, William purchased a number of heavy New Zealand mares as well as 23 draft mares from the Hunter River. This brought the herd to 40, but this was expected to grow with most of the mares being in foal to an imported horse, Paisley Jock, and a further consignment of pedigree stock coming from Sydney. William intended to grow oats and lucerne, relying on mowing machines, horse rakes and a smaller number of labourers to cultivate his land. The nucleus of a herd of pure-bred Ayrshire cattle, a dairy breed, was also established which became renowned in the district, with bulls calved on the estate being sold as far was Tiaro and Maryborough, and champion cows being exhibited at the Melbourne National Show. As part of the strategy to diversify the income of the estate, William and his manager, Hickson, had attached a sawmill to the mill by 1885. This used the boiler and engines of the mill during the non-crushing season and provided employment for a large number of men. It was hoped that this, coupled with the brick and tile works, distillery and drainage scheme would ensure the economic future of the estate. However, the crushing season of 1885/6 was to be the last time Ageston grew or crushed cane on any significant scale. In 1887 a catastrophic flood impacted the district, resulting in widespread loss of stock and infrastructure. No substantial damage was reported at Ageston and William Couldery, who had a supply of 40 000 feet of hardwood from the sawmill, offered to meet relief orders for scantling at a reduced cost. The downturn in the sugar industry at this time induced the government to hold an enquiry in 1888. William Couldery gave evidence, stating that he was no longer making a profit from sugar and arguing for the retention of South Sea Islander labour to support the industry. By this date the estate was reported as being 1300 acres, with ¬£30,000 having been invested in it. However, only five acres were under production (3 acres of sweet potato and 2 acres of lucerne). The main activities on the estate were distilling and cattle breeding, which employed 6 Europeans. There was no reference to the presence of South Sea Islanders. During the drought of 1888 William Couldery decided to cease horse breeding and instructed Brisbane auctioneers to sell his entire stud of 54 draught horses. With Hickson gone, William based himself more permanently on the property. In late 1891 he and his wife moved from Ageston to a property, Cedar Grove, on the Upper Logan. Cedar Grove was inherited from his wife‚Äôs family, and here he built a cheese factory and concentrated on dairying. William Couldery retained Ageston, however, where the bulk of his Ayrshire herd was kept ‚Äì in 1892 the herd numbered over 200 head, the largest Ayrshire herd in Queensland. In 1893, when William Couldery did not apply to have his distilling license renewed, the distillery was dismantled and the still secured by government authorities. In 1894 the estate was transferred into Susannah Couldery‚Äôs name. At this time Ageston had a large olive grove and the following year put the mill rollers to use in an olive crushing trial. By the turn of the century, William and Susannah had moved to Sydney. Ageston was occupied and managed by their son, Victor, while Cedar Grove was in the hands of Reginald Despite the advertised sale in 1899 of 330 acres of land at bargain prices, Ageston endured into the early 20th century. Cattle remained an economic pursuit, Victor Couldery building a cattle dip in 1906, and his brother, Reginald, reported as moving stock from that property to Ageston in 1907. However, the family interest in Ageston was fading. William and Susannah Couldery moved to Sydney, where Susannah died in 1912, and William in 1919. Not long after William's death the plantation was subdivided and sold off.  Archaeology  Today the site of the plantation remains an agricultural landscape that continues to grow sugar cane as well as support cattle and horses. Archaeological investigation and earlier field surveys have identified a number of artefacts and physical features relating to the functioning of the plantation. The site of the manager‚Äôs residence is located on a hill on Lot 2RP6185. Although the original house has disappeared and been replaced by a house dating from the 1930s, the site is identifiable by a set of masonry or brick stairs (reclad in contemporary sandstone and incorporated into the existing house) and a square, buried, subterranean feature of rendered brickwork said to be a cellar. Immediately north of the existing house are a large mango tree (Mangifera indica) and Cook Island pine tree (Araucaria columnaris), both of advanced age. These specimens are probably survivors of the original house garden. The pine tree in particular likely dates from the plantation period, as indicated by the conical tree in approximately the same position on the hill shown in the 1882 image below. To the east of the hill on which the residence site is located in a section of low flat land fronting the river and fringed by mangroves. This was a former sugarcane field but now supports a mixture of pasture and salt grass and is grazed by cattle. The field is dissected by a series of open drains that drain to the east through a levee bank. Visible on the eastern side of the levee bank is a large brick culvert. Information provided by the property owner indicates that there are also buried drains of terracotta pipes which extend out into the mangrove areas.A cutting believed to be the remains of the tramway originates from this field system and runs northwest, climbing the side of the manager‚Äôs residence hill. It crosses onto Lot 2SP197213 where it divides, one branch descending to the river flat lying in front of the mill site; the other branch terminating at the mill site itself.The mill is located on a north-facing slope on Lot 2SP197213, where it overlooks the Logan River. It is covered by dense tree cover and, prior to the archaeological investigation, lantana and other weedy growth. The removal of weeds and some targeted removal of the modern topsoil has revealed various brick floors and walkways, stone machinery foundations, an in-situ cast iron Cornish boiler, an overturned cast iron rectangular pan, the base of a kiln, a concrete pad tentatively interpreted as a brick-making area, a circular feature of unknown purpose, postholes, and a raised pathway leading to the site of the wharf. To the west of the mill site is a large stand of bamboo and a series of ponds. It is unknown if the bamboo or ponds are contemporaneous with the mill.

Chelicerae: rastellum is absent; cheliceral tumescence is small with diffuse limits and a small ventral projection. Its metatarsus is straight, and its color is as in female. Distribution It is a very common species in Sierras Centrales, Argentina (southern Buenos Aires Province, western C√≥rdoba Province, San Luis Province and San Juan Province - Humid subtropical climate). Behaviour A. centralis is found mostly in hilly areas of central Argentina. The species is easily found under stones, where they construct a dense silk tube (which usually also implies a short burrow). They occasionally were collected in burrows dug in the earth between stones; the burrows were closed with debris. Adult males are capable of constructing tunnel-webs, but they are quite different from those of juveniles and females, lacking the short burrow. Male courtship involves scratching and beating the ground. After contacting female silk, males have been observed to stretch the web. Males manipulate their pedipalps and spasmodically beat their legs over the female. Females remain active during copulation by making body jerks and struggling.

It is located next to Delgado Community College, behind the right field fence of the college's baseball facility, Kirsch-Rooney Stadium. The cemetery is named after Dr. Joseph Holt, an official of the New Orleans Board of Health (famously involved with city health issues concerning Storyville, the Red- light district of New Orleans) who officially established the cemetery in the 19th century. Holt Cemetery is one of the Historic Cemeteries of New Orleans. The cemetery was established in 1879 to inter the bodies of poor or indigent residents of the city. Funeral processions to Holt Cemetery were generally around, rather than through, the city. The original cemetery was 5.5 acres, and it was expanded in 1909 to 7 acres. Nearly all of the tombs are in-ground burials.https://web.archive.org/web/20071117055524/http://www.nolacemeteries.com/holt.html As established, ownership of the graves at Holt Cemetery were given to the families of the deceased for the cost of digging the grave and subsequent maintenance of the plot. Most of the graves and tombs at Holt Cemetery were not commercially or professionally produced but were instead fabricated by families of the deceased, giving the cemetery a strong personal touch. The cemetery contains the remains of known and unknown early blues and jazz musicians, including Jessie Hill and Charles \\"Buddy\\" Bolden. The battered remains of Robert Charles, at the center of the 1900 New Orleans race riot were briefly interred there, then dug up, and incinerated. Later, in 1973, four victims of the UpStairs Lounge arson attack, Ferris LeBlanc and three unidentified males, were buried in a mass grave at the cemetery.The Upstairs Fire - June 24, 1973 - 25th Anniversary Memorial Service Over the years, Holt Cemetery has been a destination of ghost hunters, with frequent incidents of grave-robbing and reports of Voodoo and Santer√≠a rituals.

However, the graves and tombs themselves remain in a state of significant neglect, with human remains being evident. New burials continue at Holt Cemetery, and the graves show evidence for frequent visits and various cultural materials. The word \\"Holt\\" means \\"Dead\\" in Hungarian.

He is the founder and president since 2002 of China Aid, which provides legal aid to Christians in China. Bob Fu was born in Shandong in 1968 and studied English literature at Liaocheng University in the 1980s. He converted to Christianity after an American teacher gave him a biography of a Chinese Christian convert. After his studies, Fu taught English at the Central Party School in Beijing while participating in the house church movement. In 1996, Bob Fu and his family emigrated to Hong Kong and then the United States, after his wife became pregnant without the government permission to have a child. Fu founded the China Aid Association in Philadelphia in 2002, but moved its headquarters to Midland, Texas in 2004. Fu is also known for his role in helping negotiate barefoot lawyer Chen Guangcheng's immigration to the United States; in this sense, has been described as a \\"liaison\\" between oppressed groups in China and foreign governments or media that can help them. Biography =Early life and education= Fu Xiqiu was born in 1968 in Shandong province and started studying English literature at Liaocheng University in 1987. During his time at university, Fu engaged in political activism and started the process of joining the Communist Party of China, with the intention of becoming a government official. His American professors would preach to students from a pocket bible after class. Fu organized a group of students from his university to participate in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 in Beijing. When he returned to Shandong, he was investigated but not detained, and ultimately decided not to join the Party. That year, an American English teacher gave him a biography of Xi Shengmo, a 19th-century Chinese Christian convert. After reading the book, Fu decided to convert to Christianity as well. After completing his studies, Fu taught English at the Central Party School in Beijing while his wife Bochun Cai (b. 1966) studied at the Renmin University of China. The couple evangelized widely, starting a campus church and secret bible school in Fangshan District, Beijing. On May 9, 1996, the couple was detained for running a Christian training center in Fangshan District, Beijing and for illegal evangelizing. On July 8, they left detention in good health, having been reportedly treated well but warned not to engage with foreigners. Authorities said that Fu could keep his job and stay in the dormitory at the Communist Party school, and would not have to pay any fines. =Emigration and activism= That same year, Fu's wife became pregnant in violation of the one- child policy. Rather than face the penalty, they emigrated to the then-British colony of Hong Kong, where Cai gave birth to Daniel Fu (). The National Association of Evangelicals successfully lobbied the Clinton White House to get Fu political asylum in the United States, where he immigrated in 1997, settling in Philadelphia and attending nearby Westminster Theological Seminary. In July 1998, Fu and Cai moved to neighboring Glenside, Pennsylvania to live with another Chinese family in a house purchased by an anonymous donor. They adopted the names \\"Bob\\" and \\"Heidi\\" at this time. Fu founded the evangelical China Aid Association in 2002 in response to a crackdown on the Hubei-based unauthorized \\"South China Church\\" (). He and other Christians raised enough money for 58 lawyers for the defense, seeding prominent stories about the trial in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. The legal charge of \\"undermining enforcement of the law\\" was dropped due to insufficient evidence. China Aid enlists thousands of volunteers in China who are available to carry out activities called on by Fu through the internet, telephone, and letters. It also pays the salaries of 30 defense lawyers. Fu has also taught at Oklahoma Wesleyan University.\\"Family Research Council: Freedom and Christianity in China\\", 24 April 2013.36 Chinese L. & Gov't 1 (2003). =Midland operations= After being invited to visit Midland, Texas by a fellow pastor, he moved his operations there in 2004. According to The New York Times, Fu maintains \\"close association with Republicans and evangelical Christians\\". He has prayed in English in American churches, and has cultivated contacts in evangelical groups in Texas. In 2008, Fu arranged for Republican House representative Frank Wolf to meet with an unauthorized house church leader in China. In 2009, Fu persuaded the Bush National Security Council and State Department to grant asylum to the family of Gao Zhisheng, a lawyer known for his defense of house Christians and other sensitive groups. In May 2012, Fu translated legal activist Chen Guangcheng's appeal to travel to the US in a special congressional hearing convened by representative Chris Smith (R-NJ). Fu criticized President Barack Obama of \\"abandoning\\" Chen for his handling of the case. In America, New York University (NYU) technicians mistakenly announced that they had found spyware installed on an iPad and iPhone that Fu had given to Chen via his wife Heidi Cai. Accessed 2013-12-22. Jerome A. Cohen of NYU accused Fu of giving Chen a trojan horse \\"enabl[ing Fu] to monitor his communications secretly\\", although Fu denied this, saying his technicians only installed Skype for Chen. Cohen and NYU later rescinded these accusations, which they said were based on a misunderstanding of the technology, and clarified that iPad and iPhone given to Mr. Chen by China Aid did not contain spyware.\\"New York University, Jerome Cohen and ChinaAid, Bob Fu Release Joint Statement Regarding the Spyware Controversy\\", 9 December 2013.

In practice, it is only actions in which unusually large sums of money are in dispute, or with an international element, that are raised in the Court of Session. If, as is usual, there are no contentious issues, it is not necessary to employ a lawyer. General The Divorce (Scotland) Act 1976 as amended by the Family Law (Scotland) Act 2006 provides for divorce grounds. Family law issues are devolved, so are now the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government. Financial consequences of divorce are dealt with by the Family Law (Scotland) Act 1985. This provides for a division of matrimonial property on divorce. Matrimonial property is generally all the property acquired by the spouses during the marriage but before their separation, as well as housing and furnishings acquired for use as a home before the marriage, but excludes property gifted or inherited. Either party to the marriage can apply to the court for an order under the 1985 Act. The court can make orders for the payment of a capital sum, the transfer of property, the payment of periodical sums, and other incidental orders. In making an order, the court is, under the Act, guided by the following principles: #The net value of the matrimonial property should be shared fairly, and the starting point is that it should be shared equally; but # fair account should be taken of economic advantage derived by either party from contributions by the other, and of economic disadvantage suffered by either party in the interests of the other party or of the family; and #The economic burden of caring for a child of the marriage under 16 years should be shared fairly between the parties (but child support is not normally awarded by the court, as this is in most cases a matter for the Child Support Agency). The general approach of the Scottish courts is to settle financial issues by the award of a capital sum if at all possible, allowing for a ‚Äòclean break‚Äô settlement, but in some cases periodical allowances may be paid, usually for a limited period. Fault is not normally taken into account. Decisions as to parental responsibilities, such as residence and contact orders, are dealt with under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995. The guiding principle is the best interests of the child, although the starting assumption is in practice that it is in a child‚Äôs best interests to maintain contact with the non-custodial parent.  Grounds for divorce Divorce is now regulated by the Divorce (Scotland) Act 1976 as amended by the Family Law (Scotland) Act 2006, which provides two legal grounds for divorce: the \\"irretrievable breakdown of the marriage\\" or where one party has undergone gender reassignment surgery and obtained an interim gender recognition certificate.Divorce (Scotland) Act 1976, s. 1(1) Irretrievable breakdown is proved by one of the parties to the marriage showing that one or more defined circumstances exist.Divorce (Scotland) Act, s. 1(2) This eliminates the need for the judge to conduct an intimate examination of the relationship between the parties.Stair, Child and Family Law (Reissue), para. 600 (Online) Retrieved 29 February 2012 There are \\"fault\\" and \\"no fault\\" grounds provided in the Act, and the speed at which a divorce can be obtained will be determined by what circumstances are relied on in the divorce proceedings. It is not possible for both parties to submit a joint petition for divorce, divorce cases must always have a person seeking the divorce (the pursuer) and a person arguing against the divorce (the defender).

Circumstantial evidence can be provided to support the claims of the pursuer and the case is determined \\"on the balance of probability\\" rather than \\"beyond a reasonable doubt\\".

Early life Born in England, Park's family immigrated to Australia as Ten Pound Poms when he was six years old. After a short stint living in a Nissen hut at the Wacol Hostel in Wacol, Queensland, they moved to Cronulla Beach in New South Wales. He left school at fifteen and worked at the local Cronulla Cinema as an assistant projectionist. A year later he joined Hoyts Theatres in the city of Sydney, where he completed his apprenticeship. Working the suburban relief roster, he screened a double feature at a different cinema every night, ten different movies per week. He credits this with creating his passion for cinema. On his twenty-first birthday his mother died in a car accident. The gym years When the work of projectionists became fully automated, Park changed careers by moving into the fitness industry. He took over a dilapidated building in Beverly Hills and opened the Leisuredome Gymnasium where he specialized in natural bodybuilding and weight loss. Over his term of ownership, Park built the gymnasium into one of Australia's premier natural bodybuilding gyms where at its peak, he had created five national champions, one world champion, and numerous state and regional title holders. Film career Park's first feature Going Once Going Twice, premiered at the Open City Film Festival in 1997 alongside The Castle. His second feature Instant Karma, premiered at the Melbourne Underground Film Festival in July 2001. He rewrote the screenplay of Instant Karma into a stage play and in September 2001 he screened the film alongside the world premiere of the play at the Bondi Pavilion Theatre. Unlike the film which was set in a modern contemporary setting, the play was staged as a black-and-white 1950s style cinema experience where the set and the actors (using makeup and costume) were completely devoid of colour. Between 2001 and 2007, while waiting for digital film technology to improve, Park concentrated on writing screenplays and developing his filmmaking skills by working on other filmmakers' films. In 2008 Park created 1 and 0 nly, a science fiction film starring only one actor, Christopher Baker (who won best actor at the 2009 Fantastic Planet Film Festival for his portrayal of Lieutenant Frank James Morley). 1 and 0 nly premiered at the Lausanne Underground Film Festival in Lausanne, Switzerland where it was awarded \\"Mention sp√©ciale √†‚Äù. It later went on to win Best Narrative Film at the 2009 Scinema Festival of Science Film. In 2010 he teamed up with his brother Ray Park and they made the feature film 1MC:Something of Vengeance. The film was shot entirely in a condemned two storey building just around the corner from where they grew up in Cronulla. In 2012 he made his fourth feature as A Lonedog Production, iSOLATE. It premiered at the Los Angeles Fear and Fantasy Film Festival (where lead actress Jacinta John won the best actress award for her portrayal of Scout Taylor) and later screened on the opening night of the 2012 CinefestOz film festival alongside The Intouchables, and 33 Postcards. He has been described as being \\"possibly the most independent filmmaker in the world.\\" A Lonedog Production In a similar production style as Shane Carruth (Primer) or an early career Robert Rodriguez (El Mariachi), when working as A Lonedog Production, Park takes on all the crewing roles, working entirely on his own. This solo method of filmmaking also continues through the post-production process.

History In 1965, at the urging of Bishop Charles E. Bennison Sr., a Diocesan Convention approved building the new Cathedral, and the next year Chicago-based architect Irving W. Colburn was hired. In 1967 a congregation was organized and ground broken for the Cathedral of Christ the King. The Cathedral was completed in two years, at a cost of $1,653,729.81, though the building was not consecrated as a cathedral until 1977. The cathedral organ was a 49-rank Aeolian/Skinner, the second to last organ built by the Skinner Company. At the entrance, the cathedral featured bas-reliefs executed by Leo Lentelli in 1922 for the facade of the Straus Building at the corner of Michigan Avenue and Jackson Boulevard in the City of Chicago from 1922 to 1952. Mown into the field at the northwest and southwest corner of the Cathedral grounds were two labyrinths. The last dean of the cathedral was the very Reverend Cynthia L. Black, who also served as president of the Episcopal Women's Caucus from 1995‚Äì2000. Sale of the Cathedral The Cathedral included office space that was rented by the Diocese of Western Michigan until 2006 when the offices moved to their present quarters in a Kalamazoo office building. Without the rental income from the diocese, the cathedral became unsustainable and was sold in 2007 to the non-denominational Valley Family Church. The organ was sold to St. Andrew's Lutheran Church in Franklin, Tennessee.

The denial of his admission became a Supreme Court case, In re Anastaplo, in which he insisted that the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects the privacy of political affiliations; in particular, he refused to answer questions about membership in the Communist Party. Anastaplo's stand was based on Constitutional principles and consequent rejection of McCarthyism, and nobody alleged that he had membership in the Communist Party. The Supreme Court's majority upheld the lower courts' ruling in favor of the Illinois Bar, although Justice Hugo Black dissented. After his Supreme Court case and denial of admission to the Bar, Anastaplo supported his family by teaching at the University of Chicago and other universities and colleges. He wrote many articles and books on philosophy, many of which acknowledged the influence of his teacher, Leo Strauss. Early life The son of Greek immigrants, Anastaplo served in the United States Army Air Corps during World War II as a navigator of B-17s and B-29s. After the war he attended the University of Chicago where he earned his B.A. in 1948 and his J.D. in 1951. Even while a law student, Anastaplo attended the lectures and seminars of Leo Strauss. Illinois Bar Exam After he had passed the Bar Exam, Anastaplo was asked a series of questions typical during the age of the Red Scare. He was asked whether members of the Communist Party should be allowed to enter the Bar and so be able to practice law, to which he replied yes. This prompted a series of questions where the interviewers asked him about the nature of Communism in America to which he retorted that political dissent and even the right of revolution were part of the American constitutional heritage. When asked whether he was a Communist, Anastaplo replied that freedom of association was guaranteed by the first amendment, and that it was improper for the Bar to ask about political affiliations of applicants. He continued to refuse to answer the question and eventually sued the Bar association, after which he promptly was counter-sued. Almost a decade later the case reached the Supreme Court. In 1961 Professor Leo Strauss bolstered Anastaplo's spirits when he was petitioning for admission to the Illinois Bar by writing the two-sentence letter: \\"This is only to pay you my respects for your brave and just action. If the American Bench and Bar have any sense of shame they must come on their knees to apologize to you.\\" Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black's dissent In re Anastaplo would \\"immortalize Anastaplo\\", said Justice Brennan upon reading it. Black's dissent was read at Black's funeral, by his instructions. Anastaplo argued the case himself before the U.S. Supreme Court, losing the case but being praised in the dissent by Justice Hugo Black. Justice Black's dissent In re Anastaplo would \\"immortalize Anastaplo\\", said Justice Brennan upon reading it. Black's dissent was read at Black's funeral, by his instructions. Aftermath Although he had lost the case, he became a figure of American liberty everywhere. He was described as the 'Socrates of Chicago'. He spoke all around the country about the importance of liberties. He taught liberal arts courses for nearly sixty years at the University of Chicago's Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies. He also taught at Rosary College and the University of Dallas. He eventually became a professor at Loyola University Chicago School of Law. He also authored a number of books that outline his experience and the impact of it. Death Anastaplo, a resident of Hyde Park, Chicago, died February 14, 2014 of prostate cancer. He was survived by his wife of 65 years, Sara Jacqueline Prince Anastaplo, four children (Helen Scharbach Newlin (nee Helen Margaret Anastaplo), George Malcolm Davidson Anastaplo, Miriam Irene Redleaf (nee Sara Maria Anastaplo), and Theodora McShan Anastaplo), and eight grandchildren.

Gift 1968 Tone Berg, f. Career M√∏rk Karlsen was born in Oslo, and at first studied with his father, the composer and organ player Rolf Karlsen. M√∏rk Karlsen later enrolled at the Oslo Music Conservatory and graduated in 1968. Throughout his career, M√∏rk Karlsen has focused on medieval, renaissance and baroque music which led him to founding the Oslo Pro Music Antiqua ensemble and leading it until 1974. He has also maintained close ties to the Musica Sacra movement, which has as its aim to renew interest in liturgy and early church music. M√∏rk Karlsen was also active as an organist throughout his professional career, retiring from the post as Asker Church organist in 2011. Karlsen¬¥s early works are characterised by an ecclesiastical liturgical-musical traditional rooting, while later works display an evolving tonal spectrum and a gradual introduction of dissonance, bringing the composer closer to contemporary styles while retaining traditional musical elements. Following a pivotal year of studies in 1983-84 with Finnish composer Joonas Kokkonen, M√∏rk Karlsen emerges as a symphonic composer, having penned a number of symphonies and oratories. M√∏rk Karlsen¬¥s sonatas and string quartets are also cornerstones of his compositional output, displaying the composers predilection for classical chamber music formats. M√∏rk Karlsen¬¥s list of works also includes a considerable output of church music compositions for choirs, soloists, instruments and organ, including the collection Laudate Dominum which encompasses 100 choir motets written for each Sunday of the church year. M√∏rk Karlsen has also focused on renewing the larger format church music with such works as the symphonic oratory Lilja (1987), Johannespasjonen (1991), Sinfonia da Requiem (1995) and St.Hallvards litani (2000).

History Sydney clergy had heeded the urgings of Pope Leo XIII, who called for Catholic newspapers to \\"counteract the appalling efforts of torrents of infidel filth that deluge the homes of our people, that desecrate the sacred sanctuary of family life, that poison the fountain-springs of society\\", and sought to establish a second Catholic newspaper. Initially costing threepence an issue, the newspaper was seen as a cheaper alternative to The Freeman‚Äôs Journal, which cost sixpence. Fr. Bunbury was the interim editor until first appointed editor, John F. Perrin, arrived from New Zealand in December 1895. Perrin had been editor of the New Zealand Tablet and a journalist in New Zealand for 20 years. John Tighe Ryan was the editor from 1897. The Catholic Press and Australian Workers' Union newspaper The Worker were the only two newspapers in Australia to oppose conscription in 1916-17, and also supported home rule for Ireland after 1916. Ryan's editorial stance against conscription was contrary to the views of Michael Kelly, Archbishop of Sydney, yet the newspaper printed many of Kelly's sermons supporting conscription and the war. The paper's circulation in 1917 was double that of 1916 and Ryan remained editor until he died in 1922. Archbishop Kelly and his successor Cardinal Norman Thomas Gilroy preferred there to be only one Catholic newspaper in Sydney and so, in 1942, the Catholic Press was amalgamated, after almost 50 years' publication, with the Freeman's Journal to become the Catholic Weekly.

Created by Xu Fuquan, a hawker from Shanghai, and described to be sour and spicy in taste, the dish is viewed as a healthy food with medicinal value in Shanghai. History Chicken and duck blood soup was invented by little-known Shanghainese hawker Xu Fuquan, who made the dish by mixing hot chicken and duck blood with the head and feet of a chicken, before boiling it in an iron pot, which he dubbed a \\"metal cow\\". In 1973, during his visit to Shanghai, then-King of Cambodia Norodom Sihanouk tried chicken and duck blood soup and reportedly enjoyed the dish a lot, having consumed countless bowls of it. Preparation and description The soup is made by boiling the blood of chicken and duck, alongside a handful of chicken organs and other body parts. Chicken and duck blood soup is described to have a sour-spicy taste. The dish is viewed as a healthy food with medicinal value in Shanghai.

Beginning in Chronica magna - copy from XV century. The Wielkopolska Chronicle (or Chronicle of Greater Poland, ) is an anonymous medieval chronicle describing supposed history of Poland from legendary times up to the year 1273. It was written in Latin at the end of the 13th or the beginning of the 14th century. Origins and possible authorship The chronicle was written from the point of view of the region of Wielkopolska (Greater Poland). Its actual title is unknown. In one of the remaining copies it's written down as Chronicum Poloniae and in another Annalia vestuste gentic Polonorum vel Kronice. Some historians, such as Brygida K√ºrbis have argued that the first edition of the work was created between 1283 and 1296 and its author was the curator of the Pozna≈Ñ capitulary, Godzis≈Çaw Baszko. A second edition was completed between 1377 and 1384, which is partly supported by inclusion of material supported by the Chronicle of Dzierzwa from the beginning of 14th century. Others, like Jan DƒÖbrowski, have posited that the entire chronicle was written by Jan of Czarnk√≥w in the second half of the 14th century. There are nine existing manuscripts, including a Great Chronicle copy which contains a collection of historical sources collected in Wielkopolska at the end of the 14th century. The purpose of the author was to record the history of the rulers of Poland. The chronicle covers mythical events from pre-history up to the year 1271/72, and in two additions the year 1273. As a source, stylistically the chronicle is composed of two parts. The first, going up to the year 1202 is based on the Chronica Polonorum of Wincenty Kad≈Çubek. The second part, written more in the style of annals is based on yearly records of Capitularies of Gniezno and Pozna≈Ñ. Other sources used by the author most likely include the lost Annales Polonorum historiae, church archives, and Vita s. Stanislai, Vita maior (Life of Saint Stanis≈Çaw) of Wincenty of Kielcza. The introduction to the work has survived in two editions of the manuscript. One of these was written in 1295/1296 (it mentions Przemys≈Ç II as the current ruler). The other, more extensive one, was most likely created in the 14th century. The chronicle was translated into Polish in 1965 by Kazimierz Abgarowicz.Quarterly Journal of Scientific Publications, 1965, Polska Akademia Nauk, Ossolineum, pg. 22, Purpose The chronicle can be seen as a gesta ducum, a composition whose purpose is to celebrate the deeds of princes and kings. The central figures of the work are the Piast rulers of Wielkoposka, Przemys≈Ç I and Przemys≈Ç II. Przemys≈Ç I is presented as an ideal of a ruler who combines knightly valor (engaging himself only in defensive wars) with religious values (Christian humility and devotion). Other ideal rulers presented in the chronicle include other Polish kings and dukes, including Boles≈Çaw II the Generous (before the murder of Saint Stanis≈Çaw) and Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth. Contents Among other stories, legends, and historical narratives, the Wielkopolska Chronicle contains the first recorded version of the legend of Lech, ƒåech, and Rus, as well as a Polish version of the story of Waldere and Hildegyth (also Waltharius), a popular tale of medieval Europe, transplanted onto Polish soil.

The law governing the creation of these governments is contained both within the Florida Constitution and Florida Statutes. Local governments are incorporated in Florida by special acts of the Florida Legislature. There are four types of local governments in Florida: counties, municipalities, school districts, and special districts.Dye, T.R., Jewett, A. & MacManus, S.A. (2007) Politics in Florida. Tallahassee: John Scott Dailey Florida Institute of Government. In some cases, the municipal and county governments have merged into a consolidated government. However, smaller municipal governments can be created inside of a consolidated municipality/county. In Jacksonville, the municipal government has taken over the responsibilities normally given to the county government, Duval County, and smaller municipalities exist within it. Both counties and cities may have a legislative branch (commissions or councils) and executive branch (mayor or manager) and local police, but violations are brought before a county court. Counties and municipalities are authorized to pass laws (ordinances), levy taxes, and provide public services within their jurisdictions. All areas of Florida are located within a county, but only some areas have been incorporated into municipalities. All municipalities are located within a county and the county jurisdiction overlays the municipal jurisdiction. Usually, if there is a conflict between a county ordinance and a municipal ordinance, the municipal ordinance has precedence within the municipality's borders; however, the overlaying county's ordinances have precedence if the overlaying county has been designated a charter county by the Florida Legislature. Counties and municipalities may create community development agencies which may take part of the money from taxes on increases in property values from their area of interest. They then use the money received in reinvestment (improvements) in the area. Local government is not required to pay for health care insurance for government retirees. As of 2010, none do. In 2011, researchers at Florida State University said that Florida's cities and counties have promised pensions they cannot afford. Pension obligations constituted 8% of total spending by local governments in 2009. Counties Florida consists of 67 counties, with most of Florida's counties named for local or national political leaders. Some are named for Spanish explorers or conquistadors, marking the influence of 200 years of Spanish rule. Natural features of the region, including rivers, lakes, and flora, are also commonly used for county names. Florida has counties named for participants on both sides of Second Seminole War: Miami-Dade County is partially named for Francis L. Dade, a Major in the U.S. Army at the time; Osceola County is named for a Native American resistance leader during the war. Each county has officers considered \\"state\\" officers, which are elected locally, their offices and salaries paid locally, but who can be removed or replaced by the governor, and not locally. These are the Sheriff, State Attorney, Public Defender, Tax Collector, County Clerk, a county Appraiser who established the value of real estate for tax purposes, and county judges. Each sheriff operates under Florida Statute 30.15. By State Law there is one school district comprising each of the counties in Florida. To provide liquidity to counties when tax bills are not paid, Florida operates under the tax lien sale process, whereby liens are sold for the amount of back taxes, interest, and costs. In Florida, bidders bid on the rate of interest (beginning at 18%) they will accept; the bidder offering the lowest rate is awarded the tax lien certificate. Once a lien has been outstanding for approximately 22 months (technically, April 1 of the second year following the year when the tax lien was originally offered for sale),Thus, a lienholder purchasing a lien at the sale in 2016 - sales are usually held in late May but cannot start later than June 1 - would have to wait until April 1, 2018, before taking action to foreclose. the tax lien holder may petition the circuit court (via the county tax collector) to begin the process for the tax deed sale of the property. Municipalities Municipalities in Florida may be called towns, cities, or villages, but there is no legal distinction between the different terms. Municipalities often have police departments, fire departments, and provide essential services such as water, waste collection, etc. In unincorporated areas of a county, the county itself provides these services. Municipalities may also enter agreements with the county to have the county provide certain services. Each county has a sheriff who also tends to have concurrent jurisdiction with municipal police departments.Municipal codes and ordinances References Florida ","title":"Administrative divisions of Florida"},{"id":"39770756","text":"Cristo Mart√≠n Hern√°ndez (born 18 June 1987) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays for SFC Minerva as a midfielder.

Female Ghost exemplifies the nineteenth century Japanese vogue for the supernatural and superstitious in the literary and visual arts. The print is part of the permanent collection of the Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Canada. Y≈´rei- zu This print belongs to a genre of Japanese painting and ukiyo-e known as y≈´rei-zu (ÂπΩÈúäÂõ≥), ghost pictures, which peaked in popularity in the mid- nineteenth century.Ross 1996, 36 Literally ‚Äòfaint (ÂπΩ- y≈´) spirit (Èúä- rei),‚Äô y≈´rei is just one of several Japanese words used to refer to spirits. Other terms include: obake („ÅäÂåñ„Åë), y≈çkai (Â¶ñÊÄ™), b≈çrei (‰∫°Èúä), shiry≈ç/ shirei (Ê≠ªÈúä), y≈´ki (ÂπΩÈ¨º), y≈çma (Â¶ñÈ≠î), y≈´kai (ÂπΩÊÄ™), rei (Èúä), bakemono (Âåñ„ÅëÁâ©), konpaku (È≠ÇÈ≠Ñ), henge (Â§âÂåñ), onry≈ç (ÊÄ®Èúä) and y≈´reijink≈ç (ÂπΩÈúä‰∫∫Âè£).tangorin.com There is a long tradition of belief in the supernatural in Japan which relates to various influences, including such imported sources as Buddhism, Taoism and Chinese folklore. The most notable influence, however, is Shint≈ç, a native animistic religion which presupposes that the physical world is inhabited by eight million omnipresent spirit beings.Rubin 2000 Kunisada Female Ghost print title cartouche Y≈´rei-zu such as this one represent the conflation of two prevailing trends in the nineteenth century Japanese literary and visual arts: depictions of the female form, and depictions of macabre or supernatural themes. During this period, ghosts‚Äî particularly the female variety‚Äî commonly figured in folktales, as well as theatre. Vengeful spirits returning to punish their wrong-doers were a staple of kabuki, bunraku and n≈ç dramas, and proved popular with audiences.Rubin 2000 Wishing to tap into this market for the macabre, painters and woodblock artists began to create images of ghosts, as well as of kabuki actors in the roles of ghost characters. Yakusha-e Kunisada entered Utagawa Toyokuni's studio from a young age, and was therefore granted access to training from the finest masters of the age, as well as valuable connections to publishers, poets' associations, theatres and actorsJesse 2012, 95 He began creating yakusha-e (actor images) in 1808, and this genre was to become the mainstay of his fame and fortune.Marks 2010, 120 So esteemed and prolific was he in this area, that he earned the epithet \\"Kunisada, the Portraitist of Actors (yakusha-e no Kunisada).\\"Jesse 2012, 95 The Temp≈ç Reforms of 1842, which had banned depictions of geisha, oiran courtesans and kabuki actors,Harris 2010, 146 began to be gradually repealed from the late 1840s,Jesse 2012, 95 which left Kunisada free to return to his favourite medium. Utagawa Kunisada (Toyokuni III) Born in 1786 in the Honj≈ç district of Edo,Marks 2010, 120 Utagawa Kunisada (Ê≠åÂ∑ùÂõΩË≤û) was an apprentice of Toyokuni I, whom he later succeeded as Toyokuni III (‰∏â‰ª£Ê≠åÂ∑ùË±äÂõΩ).Harris 2010, 70From his accession to the name Toyokuni in 1844, Kunisada consistently signed his works Toyokuni II, refusing to accept the legitimacy of his predecessor, Toyokuni II. He is, however, always referred to as Toyokuni III (Marks 2010, 120). Although he debuted as a book illustrator in 1807 with illustrations for the series of beauties \\"Twelve Hours of the Courtesans\\" (Keisei j≈´nitoki),Marks 2010, 120 his production really took off from 1809.Harris 2010, 70 He founded his own studio in the early 1810s, and demand for his illustrations soon outstripped that for his master‚Äôs.Marks 2010, 120 Not only was he respected for his artistic talent, he was also admired for his \\"convivial and balanced demeanor, and [the fact that] he delivered his commissions on time.\\"Jesse 2012, 95 Kunisada has been described as \\"without a doubt... was the most prolific and successful print artist of all time.\\"Marks 2010, 120 Until the time of his death in 1865, he was incredibly prodigious, creating between 35 and 40 thousand designs for individual ukiyo-e prints.Harris 2010, 70 He produced images from diverse genres, including kabuki-e (pictures of kabuki actors), bijin-ga (pictures of beautiful women), y≈´rei-zu (ghost pictures), sum≈ç-e (sumo wrestler pictures), shunga (erotica) and musha-e (warrior prints). Kunisada signature from Female Ghost print According to modern critics, Kunisada was \\"a trendsetter... in tune with the tastes of urban society.\\"Harris 2010, 70 He is credited with infusing ukiyo-e with a sense of realism, particularly in his representations of female subjects.Calza 2003, 335 Compared with the females idealized in prints by Utamaro, his women are shorter limbed,Calza 2003, 335 with shorter and rounder physiques.Harris 2010, 70 They are often posed with \\"slightly bent backs and knees, giving them a hunched up, stumpy look.\\"Harris 2010, 70 Like the female spirit in this print, they generally have longer faces with strong jaws giving an impression of \\"greater self-possession, if not outright aggressiveness.\\"Calza 2003, 335 The print dates to 1852 and was therefore done when Kunisada was 66, before his work declined into what has been described as \\"gaudy and ostentatious\\" use of colour.Harris 2010, 73 Critics tend to agree that Kunisada's later works suffered in quality \\"because of over-production and lowering of artistic standards.\\"Munsterberg 1998, 129 Female Ghost Nanushi, date and publisher's seals from Kunisada's Female Ghost The subject in this print corresponds to the typical depiction of female ghosts in Edo art: \\"a fragile form with long, flowing hair... dressed in pale or white clothing, the body below the waist tapered into nothingness.\\"Ross 1996, 125 The central area is dominated by the figure of a female spirit with extremely long, wildly flowing black hair, crowned by a pale blue and white decoration. Unlike in many other y≈´rei-zu, the ghost in this print is not disfigured or particularly ghoulish.This distinction is evident when this print is compared with a contemporary Kunisada image such as the ≈çkubi-e (large head print) The Ghost of Oiwa (1852) http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kunisada_The_Spectre.jpg She wears a long, pale blue kimonoSee http://ja.ukiyo-e.org/image/metro/M141-016-01(02) for versions of this print in other collections, which demonstrate colour variation. with the long sleeves (furisode - ÊåØË¢ñ) common to the kimono of single women and female ghosts.

The pool would be filled with water filtered from the river it floats in. The two companies behind it, Family New York and PlayLab, have been using the crowdfunding website Kickstarter to raise money for the project. Concept The planned cross- shaped, Olympic-sized pool would be used to clean the waters of the East River while providing a public space for water-based recreation. With its current design, the pool would flush out up to half a million gallons of river water daily through a layered filtration system. Over a quarter of a million gallons of filtered river water would be used to fill the pool itself. The planned long-term goal is to raise a total of $15 million to fund the entire pool by 2016. History In July 2011, the team raised over $41,000 on Kickstarter to test filtration materials using water from the East River. With the help of researchers at Columbia University, the tests yielded feasibility, and in July 2013 over a quarter million dollars was raised to build a 35 square foot miniature version of the floating pool. The \\"test lab\\" is to be a working prototype to analyze its effectiveness in river conditions. Since its conception, several independent companies have participated in the +POOL project, including engineering firm Arup, design firm IDEO, environmental consultants from One Nature, and art institution Storefront for Art and Architecture. The project has also been met with interest from government officials, notably New York State Senator Daniel Squadron and New York City Council Member Brad Lander. In November 2013, Time magazine ranked +POOL as one of the 25 best inventions of the year 2013. The pool was projected to open in mid-2016. Not much visible progress was made through 2016, but in April 2017, it was announced that a partnership with Heineken was formed.

Plot  Karen Warren (Kylie Travis), a former criminal psychologist, is driving on a lonely Texan road in the desert when her car breaks down. She hitches a ride with Frank (James Belushi), who is traveling with his abused wife, Rayanne (Shannon Whirry), on his way to sell stolen computer chips. They are briefly stopped by a trooper (Sherman Howard) who gives Frank a ticket for speeding, and are passed on the road by a tow truck driver (Jesse Borrego). They make a stop at a gas station belonging to Frank's friend, Sam (M. Emmet Walsh), who gives Frank evidence of Rayanne's cheating on him with the tow truck driver, Jesse. Tensions rise; Frank shoots Rayanne and attempts the same with Karen, but Karen escapes into the desert where she stumbles upon a laboratory where Brian, a scientist, is testing a time machine on mice. The machine goes off by accident, sending Karen back to where she was twenty minutes earlier. Karen awakes in Frank's car, just after she was picked up. This time when the trooper stops their car, Karen asks the trooper for help, which causes the situation to worsen ‚Äî Frank kills Rayanne, the trooper, and Jesse. Karen escapes to the laboratory, where she explains to Brian what she knows. They agree to go back in time together, so Brian can call the police on Frank. Karen awakes in Frank's car and takes his gun, causing a struggle. Rayanne reveals a gun of her own, but misses when she tries to shoot Frank. Despite Karen's preemptive knowledge, Frank kills Rayanne, Jesse, the trooper, and the vacationing parents of a boy named Paul (Robbie Thibaut Jr.). Brian, who was unable to convince the police to come, arrives on the scene and explains to Frank about the time machine. Frank, using Paul as hostage, forces Brian to send them back in time. Frank and Paul awake ten minutes earlier, in the middle of the fight. Paul helps Karen, but he and his parents are killed. When Brian arrives, Karen tells him that they have to go back again. They return to the laboratory, chased by Frank, but succeed in overloading the whole system to go back 60 minutes. Karen awakes in her car, before Frank has picked her up. When Frank and Rayanne drive by, Karen politely refuses a lift. The trooper comes by next, and Karen warns him about Frank. Brian then arrives to pick Karen up, and they arrive at the gas station after it's all over: Frank has killed Sam and Jesse, and has been shot dead by Rayanne, who is arrested by the trooper.

Geoff Andrew from the website Time Out states: \\"With its explosive action, black comedy and far-fetched sci-fi imposed on an otherwise vaguely plausible crime thriller, this modest indie film is reminiscent of such low budget '80s exploiters as Tremors and the work of Charles Band. Like the most memorable of these, it's lifted out of the rut by a quirky, imaginative script. True, Belushi's performance is overbearing and M. Emmet Walsh turns in yet another sweaty cameo; true, too, that the frequent visual emphasis on Travis' cleavage flags the movie's compromised ambitions. Nevertheless, there's more than enough energy, bravado and invention to engage the attention throughout.\\" See also * List of films featuring time loops References External links * * Category:1997 films Category:American adventure films Category:American films Category:American science fiction action films Category:Orion Pictures films Category:1990s action films Category:1990s adventure films Category:1990s science fiction films ","title":"Retroactive (film)"},{"id":"39771043","text":"Renealmia alpinia is a flowering plant species native to the Americas, where it grows from southern Mexico through much of South America, though not in the Southern Cone. It can also be found on several Caribbean islands. In Quechua it is called misk'i p'anqa (misk'i sweet; honey, p'anqa bract, \\"sweet bract\\" or \\"honey bract\\"). The name alludes to R. alpinia's value as a culinary herb, especially for flavoring fish. Among Spanish-speakers this species is known as jenjibre-de-jardin (\\"garden ginger\\"). Both jenjibre-de-jardin and ginger (Zingiber officinale) are in the family Zingiberaceae. Renealmia alpinia is commonly known as mardi gras in Trinidad, where hunters administer it either orally or topically to their hunting dogs to treat a variety of conditions, from sprains to snakebite. Biochemistry Zhou et al. (1997) of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University identified three diterpenes produced by R. alpinia: 11-hydroxy-8(17),12(E)-labdadien-15,-16-dial 11,15-hemiacetal (1) and 16-oxo-8(17),12(E)-labdadien-15-oic acid (2), which are labdane diterpenes, and 8(17),12(E)-labdadien-15,16-dial (3). The team performed these assays on the basis of reports that R. alpinia may be antipyretic (fever-reducing). Biogeography In Mexico, wild R. alpinia populations have been found in the southern states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, and Veracruz. It also grows on the Caribbean islands of Dominica, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Montserrat, Puerto Rico, St. Kitts, Nevis, Trinidad, and Tobago. In Central America, it grows in Belize, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama. In South America, it is found in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela.

Between seven and eight explosions, alleged to be suicide bombers by the Taliban, occurred outside the palace. The explosions were later followed with an intense exchange of gunfire between the three or four Taliban fighters, and Afghan security officials, which lasted 90 minutes. Obtaining fake identification, badges and vehicle passes, five of the eight Taliban members were able to clear high-level security clearances, driving two Land Cruisers similar to those used by international soldiers to penetrate the heavily fortified security zone in Kabul. All insurgents were killed in the ensuing battle with security forces. The United States Central Intelligence Agency's Afghanistan station located nearby the presidential palace was also struck by two rocket-propelled grenades during the attack. Targeting the CIA's office in the Ariana Hotel, the Taliban attacked inside one of the most heavily restricted areas of Afghanistan, in downtown Kabul where the U.S. Embassy and the headquarters of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force are located.

In 2014, the IPST became the Renewable Bioproducts Institute. The organization is a link between Georgia Tech and the international paper industry; it focuses its research on pulp and paper processes, refining forest biomass into sustainable fuels, and creating new biomaterials in order to open new markets. History Since the late 1800s, paper-making has been a vital industry in Wisconsin. Not formally trained in paper science, early workers in the industry generally relied on apprenticeship programs.Wilhoit, p. 5 In 1919, Samuel G. Plantz, the president of Lawrence College (now Lawrence University), worked with Monroe A. Wertheimer, president of the Thilmany Pulp and Paper Company (and a trustee of Lawrence College) to plan a night school for paper mill workers.Wilhoit, p. 6 Plantz envisioned workers from local paper mills teaching specialized classes, and a program that would include a partial liberal arts curriculum to create a \\"well-rounded individual\\".Wilhoit, p. 7 There were delays in starting the school, primarily financial in nature; Plantz had estimated that it would require $200,000 to $250,000 to construct a building, purchase equipment, and hire professors. Plantz died in 1924; and his interim successor, Wilson Samuel, had a brief tenure. The next president of Lawrence College, Henry M. Wriston, pushed the idea forward; along with Ernst Mahler, who was then the vice president and general manager of the Kimberly-Clark Corporation in Neenah, Wisconsin.Wilhoit, p. 8 Mahler, then known for research in cellulose chemistry, had emigrated from Austria to work in the United States and establish one of the first research labs in the industry. He was able to acquire the financial support of 19 pulp and paper companies that encompassed 90 percent of the state's paper industry and in 1929 IPST was founded as the Institute of Paper Chemistry in Appleton, Wisconsin. The school moved to a spot on Georgia Tech's northwest campus in 1989. On July 1, 2003, the IPST merged with Georgia Tech; and on September 1, 2003, the institute received a new director, William J.

Bundesautobahn 8 between Stuttgart and Ulm divides into separate northbound and southbound routes on either side of the peak. The two halves of the autobahn each traverse one tunnel and a series of two or three viaducts that were designed by Paul Bonatz and built for the Reichsautobahn; the bridges were all destroyed in World War II and had to be rebuilt, and the route in one direction was only completed in the 1950s. A project to reroute the autobahn with new tunnels and bridges has been postponed indefinitely. Route The entire segment is long. The separated sections, which are some apart at the furthest and over which the autobahn rises or descends , lie between M√ºhlhausen im T√§le and Hohenstadt, where there is an emergency access road. North of M√ºhlhausen, traffic southbound from Aichelberg, where the first viaduct is located, climbs up the north-west- facing slope of the Swabian Alps, known as the Albtrauf, crosses the long Mustobel Viaduct and travels a further through a mountain valley and the valley of the Winkelbach to the upper reaches of the River Fils, descending approximately near Gruibingen. The southbound carriageway is long, crossing the Fils northeast of M√ºhlhausen and then climbing to the long Todsburg Bridge, which skirts the Steinb√ºhl ( above sea level) near the Todsburger H√∂hle cave. It then continues to climb, crossing the long Malakoff Bridge and passing through the long L√§mmerbuckel Tunnel before rejoining the other carriageway at Hohenstadt. The northbound carriageway, long, passes through the long Nasenfels Tunnel and skirts the Drackensteiner Hang proper on the long Drachenloch Bridge (named for the 'dragon's cave', sealed off in the building of the motorway, the story of which is presumed to have given the name to the cliffside and the community of Drackenstein),Historie , Gemeinde Drackenstein, 2010 the long Himmelsleiter Bridge and the long Fischerh√§usle Bridge before crossing the Fils west of Gosbach. History Debris from the original Drachenloch Bridge in the valley below, January 2009 The segment was built during the Third Reich as part of Reichsautobahn 26 between Munich and Stuttgart. Work began in 1936 and continued on the southbound section of divided carriageway until 1942, when it stopped because of World War II. The carriageways were divided because of the steepness of the mountainside: having the entire four lanes skirt the same side of the peak was not technically feasible, and stacking the carriageways one above the other would have been too expensive. The impact of large supports under a four-lane structure on the beauty of the landscape was also a consideration, as it had been in the Aichelberg section, which was built stacked to minimise this.Frankfurter Zeitung, 11 January 1935, quoted at Jens Gla√üer, Drackensteiner Hang.de, 28 December 2011 There was a viaduct at the Aichelberg and another over the Franzosenschlucht, at Gruibingen. For the divided sections, Paul Bonatz was the primary bridge designer, in collaboration with Wilhelm Tiedje as engineer.Hartmut Frank, \\"Bridges: Paul Bonatz's Search for a Contemporary Monumental Style\\", in: The Nazification of Art: Art, Design, Music, Architecture and Film in the Third Reich, ed. Brandon Taylor, and Wilfried van der Will, Winchester studies in art and criticism, Winchester, Hampshire: Winchester Press, Winchester School of Art, 1990, , pp. 144-57, p. 154. The northbound carriageway was completed in record time and opened on 30 October 1937 carrying traffic in a single lane in each direction.Drackensteiner Hang.de > Abstieg , with many photographs including construction. Small viewing points were provided on the valley side of the road, and the viaducts were used for advertising the beauty of the autobahns,In addition to the 1942 colour photograph reproduced here, a photograph overlooking a stretch of the road and a lookout appeared in Die neue Heimat, see Erhard Sch√ºtz and Eckhard Gruber, Mythos Reichsautobahn: Bau und Inszenierung der \\"Stra√üen des F√ºhrers\\" 1933‚Äì1941, Berlin: Links, 1996, , p. 126. Alfons Darcis also wrote a book of poems about the construction work, entitled Gedichte vom Bau an der Reichsautobahn (Albaufstieg Gruibingen-Drackenstein), Stuttgart: Schwabenverlag, [1936], ; Sch√ºtz and Gruber, p. 109. and became well known. Except for the L√§mmerbuckel Tunnel, begun in late autumn 1937, work on the southbound route began in 1938, and it was not complete when construction was halted in 1942.Drackensteiner Hang.de > Aufstieg , with many photographs including construction. The almost finished L√§mmerbuckel Tunnel was then closed at both ends with heavy gates and used for production of aircraft engines and other armaments by Heller and Daimler-Benz; heating, lighting and living quarters were provided inside.A 8 L√§mmerbuckeltunnel / Geschichte, eAutobahn The land above the tunnel is still owned by Daimler, who have a training centre there. On 20 April 1945, the retreating Wehrmacht blew up the Franzosenschlucht Viaduct and the Aichelberg Viaduct on the segment of motorway north of the division of routes. Temporary wooden bridges replaced them until 1951. The Drachenloch Bridge had already been blown up on 19 March; the debris remains in the valleyPhotographs, Dieter Mayer-G√ºrr, \\"Autobahnruinen\\", in: Reichsautobahn: Pyramiden des Dritten Reichs.

The unfinished central section of the L√§mmerbuckel Tunnel was also collapsed with explosives. The southbound carriageway was finally completed in 1955-57, with work including completion of both viaducts, creation of the road bed and retaining walls (using concrete, rather than the paving stones and masonry that had been used for the northbound section), and installation of bomb shelters in the L√§mmerbuckel Tunnel, which when the segment finally opened on 25 May 1957, was the longest motorway tunnel in Europe. To enable repairs to be made to the northbound carriageway, traffic in both directions then used the southbound route until May-June 1960. Traffic on the Aichelberg segment increased hugely, from a daily average of 31,500 in 1974 to almost 50,000 in 1989, with peak loads of 75,000 a day, and both traffic jams and accidents were common. Lorries, in particular, found the gradient of almost 7% difficult to negotiate. The aging Franzosenschlucht Viaduct was supported with props in places.Der Albaufstieg am Aichelberg > Die alte Autobahn 1951 bis 1985 Between 1985 and 1990, the Aichelberg segment was extensively rebuilt, widened to the now normal three lanes in each direction, and straightened. Two new bridges were built--the Maustobel Bridge replaces a tight 'forest curve', and both the Aichelberg and Franzosenschlucht Viaducts were replaced on different sites--a wildlife crossing was constructed, and a stream was diverted.Der Albaufstieg am Aichelberg > Der Ausbau 1985 bis 1990 (2 pages) In 2005, plans were completed to similarly replace the divided routes around the mountain at the Drackensteiner Hang with a single more direct three-lane route between M√ºhlhausen and a new Hohenstadt intersection at Widderstall. The route is to include two new tunnels (Himmelsschleife, long and Drackenstein, long) and two new bridges over the Fils and Gosbach valleys ( and long).Drackensteiner Hang.de > Gegenwart (with map). The plan foresees retention of the southbound route as a rural road, with most of the northbound route being returned to a natural state, as was done after the rerouting of the Aichelberg section. The work, estimated to take five years, was to have been funded by a private investor who would then operate the segment as a toll road, the first in the German autobahn system to be funded and operated privately.\\"Autobahnmaut f√ºr den Albaufstieg\\", Stuttgarter Zeitung, 10 April 2002 : \\"Der bisher √ºberlastete Albaufstieg wird damit die erste privat finanzierte und betriebene Strecke\\".

After the 1947 murder of Elizabeth Short, a.k.a. the Black Dahlia, police came to consider Hodel a suspect. He was never formally charged with the crime and came to wider attention as a suspect after his death when he was accused by his son, Los Angeles homicide detective Steve Hodel, of killing Short and committing several additional murders. Prior to the Dahlia case, he was also a suspect in the death of his secretary, Ruth Spaulding, but was not charged. He was also accused of raping his own daughter, Tamar Hodel, but was acquitted for that crime. He fled the country several times, and spent time between 1950 and 1990 in the Philippines. Personal life George Hill Hodel Jr. was born on October 10, 1907, and raised in Los Angeles, California. His parents, George Hodel Sr. and Esther Hodel, were of Russian Jewish ancestry. Their only son, he was well-educated and highly intelligent (scoring 186 on an early IQ test). He was also a musical prodigy, playing solo piano concerts at Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium. Composer Sergei Rachmaninoff traveled to his parents' house to hear the boy play. Hodel attended South Pasadena High School and graduated at age 15 and entered the prestigious California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, but was forced to leave the university after one year, due to a sex scandal involving a professor's wife, though this is not the only account. He had impregnated the woman and wanted to raise their child together, but she refused. The affair between Hodel and the woman had caused her marriage to fall apart. By around 1928, Hodel was in a common-law marriage with a woman named Emilia and had a son by her, Duncan. In the 1930s he was legally married to a model from San Francisco, Dorothy Anthony, and had a daughter by her, Tamar. Hodel graduated from Berkeley pre-med in June 1932 and immediately afterward enrolled in medical school at the University of California, San Francisco and received his medical degree in June 1936. After the establishment and success of his medical practice and becoming head of the county's Social Hygiene Bureau, Hodel was moving in affluent Los Angeles society by the 1940s. He was enamored of the darker side of Surrealism and the decadence surrounding that art scene and was friends with such artists as a photographer Man Ray and film director John Huston, and those who associated with them. With Ray and some other Surrealists, he shared an interest in sadomasochism and the darker side of art and philosophy; with the young men of the Hollywood scene, he shared a fondness for partying, drinking, and womanizing. Hodel's second legal wife, whom he married in 1940, was John Huston's ex-wife, Dorothy Harvey. He called her \\"Dorero\\" to avoid confusion with his other wife, Dorothy Anthony, at least within their circle, but is better known to the press as Dorothy Huston-Hodel. Hodel purchased the Sowden House in 1945 and lived in that Hollywood property from 1945 until 1950. The structure, built-in 1926 by Lloyd Wright (son of the noted American architect Frank Lloyd Wright), has since been registered as a Los Angeles historic landmark. Hodel was effectively a polygamist in this large household: In the late 1940s, during the period of the deaths of Spaulding and Short, Hodel was living with \\"Dorero\\" and their three children (including Steven, who would later write books outlining a case to prove George Hodel a murderer); with his first legal wife Dorothy Anthony and their daughter Tamar; and, at times, with his original common-law wife, Emilia, mother of Hodel's eldest child (by that time an adult). He was also prone to taking a series of temporary lovers; multiple witnesses later suggested such a relationship between Hodel and Short. Hodel left the United States in March 1950 for Hawaii, then a U.S. territory, where he married an upper-class Filipino woman, Hortensia Laguda (after another four children, they divorced in the 1960s; she was later a member of the Philippine Congress as Hortensia Starke). Hodel returned to the United States in 1990, and married (legally) for the fourth time, to a woman named June, in San Francisco, where he remained for the rest of his life. He died in 1999, at the age of 91. Murder and rape suspect Hodel first came under suspicion for murder in 1945, following the death of his secretary, Ruth Spaulding, by a drug overdose. He was suspected of having murdered her in order to cover up his financial fraud, such as billing patients for tests that were never performed, and to protect various valuable secrets he had obtained about police and politicians from clients for his illegal abortion services. At about this time, Hodel left briefly for China, where he worked with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. These events first came to public attention in 2004. On January 15, 1947, the naked body of 22-year-old Elizabeth Short was discovered in an empty lot in the Leimert Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. Short had suffered gruesome mutilation, notably her body being cut in half at the waist, as well as her mouth being cut ear to ear. The case earned major publicity and prompted one of the largest investigations in the history of the Los Angeles Police Department. The case was never solved. However, authorities at the time interviewed hundreds of suspects and focused on about 25, one of whom was George Hill Hodel Jr. Various aspects of the case have suggested a strong connection to Surrealism, including the works of Man Ray in particular. In late 1949, Hodel's teenage daughter Tamar accused him of incestuous sexual abuse and impregnating her (after which she was given a back alley abortion). He was acquitted after a widely publicized trial. There had been three witnesses present during and who participated in the sex acts. Two testified at the trial, and the third recanted her earlier testimony and refused to come forward, the theory being that Hodel had threatened her into silence. The trial had caused Tamar to look like a liar and that she had made up the entire abuse allegation for attention. Hodel came to police attention as a suspect in the Elizabeth Short murder in 1949 after the sexual abuse trial; known or suspected sex criminals in the area were being investigated first, and it had come out in that trial that Tamar had allegedly claimed that her father was the Dahlia killer. Hodel's medical degree also aroused suspicion, given the hypothesis that whoever bisected Short's body had some degree of surgical skill. At least eight witnesses claimed first-hand knowledge of a 1946 relationship between Short and Hodel, then back in Los Angeles from China. The full details of the investigation came to light only in 2003, when a \\"George Hodel‚ÄìBlack Dahlia File\\" was discovered in the vault at the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office. The file revealed that in 1950, Hodel was the prime suspect of the Dahlia murder. His private Hollywood residence was electronically bugged by an 18-man DA/LAPD task force during the period February 15 to March 27, 1950. The transcripts of conversations revealed Hodel's references to performing illegal abortions, giving payoffs to law enforcement officials, and to his possible involvement in the deaths of his secretary and Short. The DA tapes recorded him saying: Hodel was also interviewed as a suspect in the nearby June 1949 murder of Louise Springer, the \\"Green Twig Murder\\", though evidence to support this accusation was not publicly available until July 2018. In October 1949, Hodel's name was mentioned in a formal written report to the grand jury as one of five prime suspects in the Short murder, but none of the named suspects were submitted to the grand jury for consideration for indictment, as the investigation was still \\"ongoing\\". By April 1950, Jemison had gathered enough evidence to charge Hodel and was about to arrest him for the Short murder, when Hodel again left the United States. He obtained a degree in psychiatry and counseled prisoners in the Territorial prison in Hawaii for three years, then moved on to the Philippines, where he started a new family, and appears to have remained until 1990, finally dying in 1999 in San Francisco without charges ever being filed. However, his son Steve has written that he believes Hodel re-entered the United States multiple times each year from 1958 through 1988 and specifically in 1966‚Äì1969 to commit more murders, and then returned to the Philippines after. =Reactions= After Hodel died in 1999, his son Steve Hodel, a former LAPD homicide detective, wanted to learn more about his father. During that process he uncovered information that led him to believe his father was in fact Short's killer. His investigation began with the discovery of a photo album owned by Hodel, which contained a portrait of a dark-haired young woman whom Steve Hodel believed was Short. During Steve Hodel's investigation, he learned that his father may have been responsible for more than one murder. Steve Hodel also suspected his father of being the Chicago \\"Lipstick Killer\\" of the late 1940s, the Manila \\"Jigsaw Murderer\\" of 1967, and even the San Francisco \\"Zodiac Killer\\" of the late 1960s, among other such crimes. A September 2006 episode of Cold Case Files, hosted by Bill Kurtis, illustrates the mixed reaction to Steve Hodel's hypothesis as outlined in his first book, Black Dahlia Avenger (2003). Head Deputy District Attorney Stephen Kay described himself as highly impressed by Steve Hodel's research and conclusions and even went so far as to declare the case had been solved. Others have noted that Kay, who has since retired, formed this conclusion by treating Steve Hodel's many disputed assertions as established fact. Less impressed was active Detective Brian Carr, the LAPD officer then in charge of the Black Dahlia case which was still officially open. Carr's opinion was that Hodel's theory was based on a few intriguing facts linked together by unsubstantiated supposition. Short's relatives also disagreed that the photos in Hodel's album were of Short. Carr added that if he ever took a case as weak as Steve Hodel's to a prosecutor he would be \\"laughed out of the office\\". Carr, admitting that he had not read all of Steve Hodel's materials, added, \\"I don't have the time to either prove or disprove Hodel's investigation. I am too busy working on active cases.\\" Steve Hodel has since produced two additional books on the Dahlia case, and several books on the Zodiac killer and other cases, attempting to link them to his father. In the years following George Hodel's leaving the country, investigators from both the LAPD and the District Attorney office privately stated that they believed Black Dahlia case was \\"solved\\" and that Hodel was the killer, though they did not have enough evidence to go to trial. Specific quotes from the top brass include the following: * Chief of Detectives Thad Brown: \\"The Black Dahlia Case was solved. He was a doctor who lived on Franklin Avenue in Hollywood.\\" * LAPD Chief of Police William H. Parker: \\"We identified the Black Dahlia suspect. He was a doctor.\\" * LASD undersheriff James Downey: \\"The Black Dahlia Case was solved, but it will never come out. It was a doctor they all knew in Hollywood involved in abortions.\\" * DA Lt. Frank Jemison: \\"We know who the Black Dahlia killer was. He was a doctor but we didn't have enough to put him away.\\" The DA Files confirmed that the doctor referred to was George Hill Hodel. Head Deputy DA Steve Kay reviewed the case and provided a legal opinion that \\"the case was solved\\", then presented it to then active LAPD Chief of Detectives James McMurray in 2004. McMurray, after reviewing the investigation, gave the following order to the Robbery/Homicide detectives under his command: \\"Unless you can find some major holes in [Steve] Hodel's investigation, go ahead and clear the Black Dahlia Murder.\\" In 2014, Detective II Mitzi Roberts, the currently assigned LAPD Black Dahlia case detective, stated in an interview with KMEX Univision television newsman Leon Krauze, \\"I actually agree with you. I think he [Steve Hodel] has made a very compelling theory. I think there is a lot of things that look like it, and his dad could actually be responsible for the murder of the Black Dahlia.\\" W. Glenn Martin's \\"Dying Declaration Letter\\" In July 2018, Sandi Nichols of Indianapolis, Indiana, while going through her recently deceased mother's personal effects, discovered a \\"Dying Declaration Letter\\" written by her grandfather, W. Glenn Martin, some 70 years before (October 26, 1949). The handwritten envelope read, \\"In case of Margaret Ellen's or Glenna Jean's Death\\" and was initialed \\"WGM\\"; the letter was written out of fear that one or both of his teenage daughters might be killed. The three-page letter identified W. Glenn Martin as a paid LAPD police informant working for a \\"Sgt. McCawley\\" (Sgt. McCauley, LAPD Internal Affairs Division). He described his activities as working undercover for LAPD detectives to help them identify and arrest corrupt police officers; in his words, \\"... it was to try and see if other officers could be inveigled into crime.\\" The Martin letter, reproduced in full in the chapter \\"Afterword\\" in Black Dahlia Avenger III, went on to name \\"GH\\" on 17 separate occasions identifying him as a personal acquaintance of Martin's as well as of McCauley's, and named him as the killer of both Short and of a second lone woman, Louise Springer, the \\"Green Twig Murder\\" victim. Martin's letter claimed that both he and \\"GH\\" personally knew the Springer woman and that he believed \\"GH\\" also killed her. LAPD at that time was actively investigating the Springer and Black Dahlia murders and had publicly identified them as \\"probably connected\\". Springer was garroted on June 13, 1949, just two blocks from where Short's body was found in 1947. Included in the letter was the fact that LAPD, after being informed that \\"GH\\" knew victim Springer, that \\"GH\\" was taken in and \\"grilled about the Springer murder.\\" The Martin letter made it clear that \\"GH\\" was known and protected by law enforcement officers, and that they \\"let him go.\\" Martin's instructions were that his letter was to be opened only in case of harm coming to either of his daughters. No harm came to either of them so the letter remained unreported and in the family's possession for 70 years until discovered and read by Martin's granddaughter. Comparisons to the Zodiac killer In 2009, Steve Hodel's book Most Evil: Avenger, Zodiac and the Further Serial Murders of Dr. George Hill Hodel was published. This follow-up work examined the possibility that Hodel had also committed crimes outside of Los Angeles: in Chicago (the 1945‚Äì1946 \\"Lipstick murders\\"), in Manila, Philippines (the 1967 \\"Jigsaw murder\\" of Lucila Lalu), and in the San Francisco Bay Area (the 1968-1969 \\"Zodiac murders\\"). For the San Francisco cases, thirty-one unique MOs and criminal \\"signatures\\" were presented, along with a questioned document expert (QDE) testimony that \\"the George Hodel and Zodiac handwriting samples were written by one and the same person.\\" The California Department of Justice (DoJ) conducted their own independent handwriting examination and while the results were not 100% positive, their QDE expert stated: \\"I am unable to eliminate George Hodel as Zodiac. I would request additional samples of his lowercase handwriting.\\" (Currently, lowercase handwriting samples have not been found.)Hodel, Steve. Black Dahlia Avenger II; \\"Chapter 18: Handwriting Update\\". While police often use document examiners during investigations, court rulings on the scientific validity of handwriting analysis have been mixed to negative.E.g.: \\"Even more troubling is an apparent lack of double-blind studies demonstrating the ability of certified experts to distinguish between individual's handwriting or identify forgeries to any reliable degree of certainty. This lack of testing has serious repercussions on a practical level: because the entire premise of interpersonal individuality and intrapersonal variations of handwriting remains untested in reliable, double-blind studies, the task of distinguishing a minor intrapersonal variation from a significant interpersonal difference‚Äîwhich is necessary for making an identification or exclusion‚Äîcannot be said to rest on scientifically valid principles.\\" United States. v. Johnsted, 30 F.Supp.3d 814, 817 (W.D. Wis. 2013). This investigative sequel, while not claiming \\"case solved\\", did request that law enforcement obtain and compare DNA samples. As of 2019, no confirmed Zodiac DNA exists that can be compared with Hodel's known DNA. Another suspect, William Heirens, was convicted of the ‚ÄúLipstick Murders‚Äù in Chicago in 1946, but professed his innocence (despite confessing). A second major suspect was a man named Richard Russell Thomas, originally of Phoenix, Arizona. George Hodel was never considered a suspect until Steve Hodel interviewed Heirens in 2003, thought him innocent, and proposed George Hodel as the killer in the 2009 book. According to the book, information in the district attorney's Hodel/Black Dahlia files, released in 2003, documented that victim Elizabeth \\"Black Dahlia\\" Short some six months prior to her murder in June 1946, traveled to Chicago and began her own investigation into the \\"Lipstick Murders\\" while her acquaintance and possible lover George Hodel was temporarily doctoring for the UN in China. The files indicate that the Chicago coroner believed that the killer of one of the victims, six-year-old Suzanne Degnan, \\"had to have been a skilled surgeon as a hemicorporectomy was performed on the child's body by cutting between the 2nd and 3rd lumbar vertebrae;.... This was a fine piece of surgery.\\" Steve Hodel's hypothesis is that his father was responsible for both murders: George Hodel discovered that Short was investigating the Chicago murders, so he quit his job and returned to the US to put a stop to it; Short was dead within two months. Steve Hodel's view is that her killer performed surgery too closely comparable to that in the Degnan child case to be coincidental. Short's body was also placed off a street named Degnan, matching the surname of the Chicago child. In September 2015, Steve Hodel published a six-year follow-up under the title Most Evil II. The new volume offered additional allegations that linked George Hodel to the San Francisco Bay Area \\"Zodiac\\" murders, and presented evidence that George Hodel may have been the writer of the legitimate 1970 Zodiac coded cipher mailed to the San Francisco Chronicle and turned over to SFPD. The proposed solution was posited by M. Yves Person, a high-school teacher in Paris. According to Person, George Hodel, using Ogham (an ancient Celtic alphabet) signed his real name, H O D E L, placing it both as the return address on the envelope and as a signatory inside the card which read, \\"You Ache to Know My Name...I'll Clue you in...\\". 2019 TNT dramatic portrayals In January 2019, the American TV network TNT simultaneously aired two \\"companion\\" productions. The first, a six-part limited television miniseries entitled, I Am the Night, is a fictionalized drama focusing on the life of Fauna Hodel and her discovery that her grandfather, Dr. George Hill Hodel (played by actor Jefferson Mays) was the prime suspect in the Black Dahlia Murder. Scenes for the fictional version were shot on location at Dr. Hodel's residence (1945-1950) the historic Frank Lloyd Wright Jr.-built John Sowden House at 5121 Franklin Avenue, Hollywood, California. (In real life, Fauna Hodel never met or spoke to her grandfather.) The second project was what TNT termed a ‚Äúcompanion‚Äù eight-part documentary podcast, entitled Root of Evil: The True Story of the Hodel Family and the Black Dahlia, a Cadence13/TNT production using archival audio and interviews with Hodel family members. The podcast includes many of the actual investigative findings and linkage of Dr. George Hodel to the Black Dahlia murder, establishing that according to secret police records he, in fact, knew and had dated the victim in the 1940s. Both series suggest that Fauna Hodel might be both the granddaughter and the daughter of Dr. George Hodel. In 1949, George Hodel had been arrested and tried for incest by LAPD; his 14-year-old daughter Tamar accused him of raping her, resulting in a pregnancy she aborted. Dr. Hodel obtained criminal defense attorney Jerry Giesler and was acquitted after a three-week jury trial. The Root of Evil producer Zak Levitt was able to obtain DNA analysis and a review of the results by one of the world's leading experts, which positively eliminated Dr. George Hodel as the biological father of Fauna Hodel. The Root of Evil podcast attained a No. 1 ranking in the United States following its debut in February 2019.

A re-telling of the Robin Hood legend from the perspective of twelve characters associated with the legend, the story centers around English noblewoman Lady Marian FitzWalter's encounters with Lord Robert of Locksley and his scheming rival the Sheriff of Nottingham amid the backdrop of Prince John's schemes ‚Äì he aims to increase his own wealth and power at the expense of post-Conquest England and his brother, King Richard. Roberson wrote her novel as a prequel to the known legend. Understanding that Robin Hood lacked a single origin story, she decided to create an original narrative that depicted how \\"seven very different people from a rigidly stratified social structure came to join together to fight the inequities of medieval England.\\" Roberson spent a year researching and writing the story, and sought to combine fact and legend in developing the motivations for certain characters. The novel was published in September 1992 by Zebra Books, with a cover designed by illustrator Anne Yvonne Gilbert. Lady of the Forest received generally positive reviews, and has been analyzed by Robin Hood scholar Stephen Thomas Knight, who observed that Roberson's Marian is a \\"strong woman\\" who helps Robert, a traumatized veteran of the Crusades, adjust to his life in England; Knight connects this to the \\"post-Vietnam\\" mood that existed when the novel was written. Roberson released a sequel, Lady of Sherwood, in 1999. Plot summary The story begins in the spring of 1194 in the English county of Nottinghamshire. Lady Marian FitzWalter attends a festival held at Huntington Castle by the Earl of Huntington, who wishes to honour the return of his only surviving heir, Lord Robert of Locksley, from the Crusades. Marian seeks an audience with Robert to learn the manner of her father, Sir Hugh's, death the previous year, as Robert was a witness. The reserved, mentally scarred Robert reacts strongly, having flashbacks to Sir Hugh's violent murder at the hands of Saracens. He informs her that Hugh wished for Marian to marry William DeLacey, the harsh and scheming Sheriff of Nottingham, to her dismay. DeLacey knows naught of this, but intends to make her marry him anyway. Prince John arrives unexpectedly with plans: he states his wish to ally himself with the Earl by marrying Robert to his bastard daughter Joanna, and also approaches DeLacey about raising more taxes ostensibly to be sent to ransom John's brother, King Richard. In truth, John wishes to keep the revenue for himself and maintain his brother's imprisonment. Soon after, Marian is reluctantly manipulated into accompanying the Sheriff to attend a market at Nottingham Castle. There, she is kidnapped by the prisoner William \\"Scarlet\\" Scathlocke, an enraged man imprisoned for killing four Norman soldiers, and is taken into the depths of nearby Sherwood Forest. Lord Robert, who was taught how to navigate the massive forest as a youth, secretly tracks Scarlet and is able to secure Marian's release. While accompanying Marian back to her modest manor ‚Äì Ravenskeep ‚Äì Robert falls ill from a fever. Marian gradually wears down the mental wall he had built up in captivity by the Saracens, and after his recovery at Ravenskeep, they consummate their relationship soon after she refuses DeLacey's offer of marriage. Robert returns to Huntington, along the way besting outlaws such as Adam Bell and Will Scarlet at a contest of archery. He encounters his father and several other prominent noblemen, and is told they wish for him to marry Joanna to mislead Prince John about their intentions to thwart his grabs for power. Robert refuses. Meanwhile, Marian barely avoids being forced to marry DeLacey, and only escapes with the help of the kind Friar Tuck and the Sheriff's seneschal Guy de Gisbourne, who is infatuated with her. She flees to Huntington Castle; the Earl is displeased with his son's disobedience and their liaison, causing Marian and Robert to travel to the small village of Locksley, his namesake and holding. Robert endeavours to steal the funds needed for King Richard's ransom, and begins robbing the rich with the help of Sherwood's outlaws, whom he has gradually befriended. At the same time, Eleanor of Aquitaine, Richard's mother, is working to raise the ransom through more legal methods: by taxing clergy and laymen for a quarter of the value of their property, confiscating the gold and silver treasures of the churches, and imposing scutage and carucage taxes. Back in the small village of Locksley, Marian is captured and sent to the Sheriff's dungeon, where she is given an ultimatum: marry DeLacey or find herself charged with witchcraft. She is rescued by Robert, who arrives with his friends to free her. Just as they are about to be arrested by a wrathful Prince John, whose money has been stolen by the outlaws, King Richard arrives unexpectedly, allowing Robert and his associates to escape. Development American author Jennifer Roberson was known for writing fantasy novels before she moved into historical fiction, a genre new to her. She noted, \\"One thing I'd always wanted to try ‚Äìanother ‚Äòsomeday‚Äô dream ‚Äì was a big, sprawling, mainstream historical epic.\\" She proposed to her literary agent that she write a reinterpretation of the Robin Hood legend from the perspective of Maid Marian. Roberson understood that her rendition was not a \\"recounting\\" of the original story, because \\"there is none\\"; rather, Lady of the Forest was \\"purely [her] own concoction.\\"Roberson, Lady of the Forest, p. 591. Describing the novel as a prequel, the author explained, \\"I wanted very much to write the story of how the legend came to be; the tale of how seven very different people from a rigidly stratified social structure came to join together to fight the inequities of medieval England. To me, the key was logic‚ÄîI interwove historical fact with the fantasy of the classic legend, and developed my own interpretation of how things came to be. I wanted to come to know all of these people; to climb inside their heads and learn what motivated them to do what they did.\\" It took Roberson a year to research and write the novel. She credited as resource materials J. C. Holt's Robin Hood, Maurice Keen's The Outlaws of Sherwood, The Ballads of Robin Hood, Elizabeth Hallam's The Plantagenet Chronicles, W. L. Warren's King John, as well as the works of Frances and Joseph Gies. In a 2007 interview, Roberson stated that writing the story was \\"extremely challenging\\" because she employs the viewpoints of twelve main characters ‚Äì Marian, Lord Robert, DeLacey, Sir Guy de Gisbourne, the Earl of Huntington, Eleanor DeLacey (the Sheriff's plain, scheming daughter), Friar Tuck, Will Scarlet, the minstrel Alan of the Dales (whom becomes an outlaw after being falsely accused of rape), the simple boy Much, the moneylender Abraham the Jew (who Robert uses to raise money for the ransom), and the shepherd turned reluctant outlaw Little John. Roberson believed that this experience made her a better writer. Roberson has spoken of the difficulties of writing medieval women, particularly because so many contemporary authors are accused of giving their characters \\"anachronistic independence of thought and feminist leanings.\\"Roberson, Lady of the Forest, p. 592. The author acknowledged that with Eleanor DeLacey, an invented character, she \\"tread[s] close to the boundaries\\" but believes Eleanor is a reflection of women of \\"loose morals\\", who indeed existed in the 1190s. Roberson continued, \\"I choose to believe an Eleanor might well have looked to sexual dalliance as a means of seeking freedom of choice in an age when women had very little.\\"Roberson, Lady of the Forest, p. 593. Conversely, Marian, Roberson wrote, \\"is a truer product of her times, shaped by the ordinary responsibilities and expectations of a medieval woman.\\" Marian only gains the strength and freedom to love after the loss of her good reputation as a captive in Sherwood Forest. Analysis Stephen Thomas Knight, a scholar on Robin Hood, has written extensively on Roberson's \\"interesting\\" perspective of the legend.Knight, Robin Hood: An Anthology of Scholarship and Criticism, p. xx. According to him, Lady of the Forest was another in a long line of contemporary stories that has elevated Marian to \\"hero status\\".Knight, Icons of the Middle Ages, p. 404. He connects this to a corresponding \\"weakening\\" of Robin in Roberson's story, noting that there is a relationship between the novel's \\"post-Vietnam\\" date and its story, with Robin rendered as a \\"battleweary veteran returning from the Crusades\\" in a \\"traumatized state.\\"Knight, Robin Hood and the Crusades, p. 218. Knight continues that \\"it is evident that Roberson is using the post-Vietnam mood as the basis for her weakening of Robin to permit a 'strong woman' presentation of Marion.\\" Roberson's Marian is made \\"an independent and intelligent woman who helps Lord Robin, traumatised by the crusades, re-establish himself both as a man and a leader of resistance.\\"Knight, Remembering Robin Hood, p. 158. In an article published in the Journal of Gender Studies, Jane Tolmie stated that Lady of the Forest was another in a long line of contemporary fantasy novels that depicted women having to endure acts of rape, violence, and oppression as \\"aspects of a continuum rather than as isolated difficulties\\" ‚Äì Marian for instance is subjected to abductions and attempted forced marriage.Tolmie, Medievalism and the Fantasy Heroine, pp. 148‚Äì49. Tolmie added that in the context of Roberson's book, Marian is praised as \\"extraordinary\\" only within the \\"oppressive, gender-based\\" criteria promoted by the patriarchal Norman society.Tolmie, Medievalism and the Fantasy Heroine, p. 155. After Marian wields a quarterstaff to attack another, Robert compares the lady to a man, namely her father ‚Äì both \\"had met adversity with the same determination, the same intensity.\\"Roberson, Lady of the Forest, p. 302. Release and reception Lady of the Forest was published in September 1992 by New York City-based Zebra Books, with cover art by Anne Yvonne Gilbert. A Japanese translation was released in 1994, while a German edition was published in 2003. Roberson stated in a March 2007 interview that \\"various options\\" had been taken for adapting the book but added that this was true of many other works. In 1999, she followed the novel with the sequel Lady of Sherwood, which depicts the effects of King Richard's death: the outlaws are persecuted anew by the Sheriff, while the Earl works against John in favor of Arthur of Brittany. Lady of the Forest has received generally positive reviews, with Stephen Knight deeming it a \\"highly effective novel.\\" The Library Journal lauded Roberson for thoroughly researching the story and yet not overwhelming readers with facts, and predicted the book would be popular in the wake of the 1991 feature film Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. The Journal continued that the author's \\"personal touches create a delightful historical novel with traditional romantic overtones. The writing is so colorful and active that it is difficult to put the book down.\\" Publishers Weekly praised the novel for its \\"lively storytelling and pacing\\", which helped make it \\"an enjoyable, almost creditable recasting of the Robin Hood legend as historical fiction.\\" The book's romance, the reviewer added, \\"works beautifully, capturing in the tale of Robin and Marian the terrifying bliss of first love. A diverting, delightful book from a most promising talent.\\" However, Publishers Weekly included some criticisms, opining that Robert of Locksley and Marian \\"are unlikely to have been as naive as Roberson depicts them.\\" See also * List of historical novels * Robin Hood in popular culture References =Works cited=   * Category:Fiction set in the 1190s Category:1992 American novels Category:Novels set in Nottinghamshire Category:Books illustrated by Anne Yvonne Gilbert Category:Robin Hood books ","title":"Lady of the Forest"},{"id":"39771278","text":"Ernst Mahler (October 17, 1887 ‚Äì July 30, 1967) was an Austrian chemist and leader of the Kimberly-Clark Corporation in Wisconsin. Mahler developed, refined, and commercialized various popular products and processes of papermaking. He was also instrumental in the foundation of the Institute of Paper Science and Technology (IPST) as well as the Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry (TAPPI). Early life and education Mahler was born in Vienna, Austria on October 17, 1887. He went to Darmstadt, Germany to attend Darmstadt University of Technology, and studied industrial chemistry, specializing in cellulose chemistry and the science of papermaking. He graduated with distinction in 1912. Mahler came to the United States in 1912 and became a naturalized citizen in 1917. He took employment with Kimberly- Clark in Neenah, Wisconsin, and served as the papermaking company's head chemist. He married Carol Lyon of Minneapolis in August, 1918. Career Mahler spearheaded research and development at his company, and perfected numerous innovative chemical processes. His development of creped wadding, a soft and fluffy absorbent material, became over time one of Kimberley-Clark's most important products and the source of billions of dollars in global sales. During World War I, creped wadding made from paper had been developed as a cotton substitute for surgical dressings; under Mahler's commercialization process, it became the basis of such well-known products as Kleenex and Kotex. Mahler rose through the corporate hierarchy from chemist to Executive Vice President in 1937. He led Kimberly-Clark until his retirement in 1952. The US Army Service Forces appointed Mahler to their purchase policy division during World War II. After the war, he spent further time as a consultant for the reconstitution of papermaking industries in Belgium, Holland, France and Germany. For these services, Mahler was awarded the US Army Medal of Freedom in 1946. Mahler served on the Board of Directors of the Neenah West National Bank, and was an active town resident and civic leader. Prior to his death, he and his wife arranged to donate over 26 acres of their private property to the municipality for community recreational purposes. Mahler Park remains in steady use as a popular public park to the present day. Mahler died on July 30, 1967, and was buried in an Episcopal service at Oak Hill Cemetery in Neenah. Awards and memberships Mahler was widely recognized for his contributions to paper technology and business. He had been a founding member of the international Technical Association of the Pulp and Paper Industry (TAPPI, est. 1915) and the Institute of Paper Chemistry (now IPST, est. 1929). TAPPI bestowed its gold award for industry contributions in 1932, and IPST appointed him as an honorary chairman. His alma mater Darmstadt augmented his 1912 degree with an honorary doctorate of engineering in 1958. Honorary degrees were also bestowed to him by Lawrence University and Brown University. In 1996, Mahler was named posthumously to the Paper Industry International Hall of Fame. In 1954 Mahler was elected chairman of the committee to organize what eventually became the Bergstrom-Mahler Museum of Glass, whose present collection numbers over 3,500 objects and hosts over 20,000 visitors while being revered in glass collecting communities worldwide.

In November 2015, British Conservative Party MP Richard Graham was accused of quoting Joseph Goebbels in defending a new surveillance bill with the words \\"if you've nothing to hide you have nothing to fear\\". Former Conservative Foreign Secretary William Hague also used the same phrase in 2013. = Against the argument = Edward Snowden: \\"Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.\\" \\"When you say, ‚ÄòI have nothing to hide,‚Äô you‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt care about this right.‚Äô You‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt have this right, because I‚Äôve got to the point where I have to justify it.‚Äô The way rights work is, the government has to justify its intrusion into your rights.\\" Daniel J. Solove stated in an article for The Chronicle of Higher Education that he opposes the argument; he stated that a government can leak information about a person and cause damage to that person, or use information about a person to deny access to services even if a person did not actually engage in wrongdoing, and that a government can cause damage to one's personal life through making errors. Solove wrote \\"When engaged directly, the nothing-to-hide argument can ensnare, for it forces the debate to focus on its narrow understanding of privacy. But when confronted with the plurality of privacy problems implicated by government data collection and use beyond surveillance and disclosure, the nothing-to-hide argument, in the end, has nothing to say.\\" danah boyd (name styled lowercase), a social media researcher, opposes the argument, stating that even though \\"[p]eople often feel immune from state surveillance because they‚Äôve done nothing wrong,\\" an entity or group can distort a person's image and harm one's reputation, or guilt by association can be used to defame a person.boyd, danah. \\"Danah Boyd: The problem with the ‚ÄòI have nothing to hide‚Äô argument.\\" (Opinion) The Dallas Morning News.

Moore, author of Privacy Rights: Moral and Legal Foundations, argued, \\"it is the view that rights are resistant to cost/benefit or consequentialist sort of arguments. Here we are rejecting the view that privacy interests are the sorts of things that can be traded for security.\\"Moore, p. 204. He also stated that surveillance can disproportionately affect certain groups in society based on appearance, ethnicity, and religion. Moore maintains that there are at least three other problems with the \\"nothing to hide\\" argument. First, if individuals have privacy rights, then invoking \\"nothing to hide\\" is irrelevant. Privacy, understood as a right to control access to and use of spaces, locations, and personal information, means that it is the right holder who determines access. To drive this point home Moore offers the following case. \\"Imagine upon exiting your house one day you find a person searching through your trash painstakingly putting the shredded notes and documents back together. In response to your stunned silence he proclaims 'you don‚Äôt have anything to worry about ‚Äì there is no reason to hide, is there?'\\" Second, individuals may wish to hide embarrassing behavior or conduct not accepted by the dominant culture. \\"Consider someone‚Äôs sexual or medical history. Imagine someone visiting a library to learn about alternative lifestyles not accepted by the majority.\\" Finally, Moore argues that \\"nothing to hide,\\" if taken seriously, could be used against government agents, politicians, and CEO's. This is to turn the ‚Äúnothing to hide‚Äù argument on its head. Moore argues that the NSA agent, politician, police chief, and CEO have nothing to hide so they should embrace total transparency like the rest of us. \\"But they don‚Äôt and when given the technological tools to watch, the politician, police chief, or CEO are almost always convinced that watching others is a good thing.\\" Bruce Schneier, a computer security expert and cryptographer, expressed opposition, citing Cardinal Richelieu's statement \\"If one would give me six lines written by the hand of the most honest man, I would find something in them to have him hanged\\", referring to how a state government can find aspects in a person's life in order to prosecute or blackmail that individual.Schneier, Bruce. \\"The Eternal Value of Privacy.\\" Schneier on Security.

The real choice is liberty versus control.\\" Emilio Mordini, philosopher and psychoanalyst, argued that the \\"nothing to hide\\" argument is inherently paradoxical. People do not need to have \\"something to hide\\" in order to hide \\"something\\". What is hidden is not necessarily relevant, claims Mordini. Instead, he argues an intimate area which can be both hidden and access-restricted is necessary since, psychologically speaking, we become individuals through the discovery that we could hide something to others.Mordini \\"Nothing to Hide ‚Äî Biometrics, Privacy and Private Sphere.\\" p.257-60 Julian Assange states: \\"There is no killer answer yet. Jacob Appelbaum (@ioerror) has a clever response, asking people who say this to then hand him their phone unlocked and pull down their pants. My version of that is to say, 'well, if you're so boring then we shouldn't be talking to you, and neither should anyone else', but philosophically, the real answer is this: Mass surveillance is a mass structural change. When society goes bad, it's going to take you with it, even if you are the blandest person on earth.\\" Harvey A. Silverglate estimated that the common person, on average, unknowingly commits three felonies a day in the US. Ignacio Cofone, law professor, argues that the argument is mistaken in its own terms because, whenever people disclose relevant information to others, they also disclose irrelevant information. This irrelevant information has privacy costs and can lead to other harms, such as discrimination. See also   References Sources * Bennett, Colin J.

Her works have primarily featured the Regency era. Early life Lecia Cornwall was born in Toronto. She became interested in history after watching the miniseries The Six Wives of Henry VIII at the age of ten, which prompted her to begin reading about the Plantagenets and the Tudors, as well as fairy tales. Years later, after staying home to raise her children, Cornwall decided to begin writing fiction, with a focus on medieval historical romance. To learn how to write a novel, she read as many medieval romances as possible at her local library, including works by Jo Beverley, Philippa Gregory, Jude Deveraux, and Julie Garwood. Having exhausted the library's offerings on the subject, Cornwall discovered Bernard Cornwell's \\"dashing, brave, tormented, inspiring hero\\" Richard Sharpe, who interested her in reading other Regency-era fiction by such authors as Mary Balogh, Julia Quinn, and Eloisa James. She also read non-fiction works on the era. Cornwall considers the Regency period to be Writing career Cornwall's writing career began in 2009, when she learned that one of her manuscripts had attracted a literary agent wishing to represent her. This manuscript became Cornwall's debut novel, Secrets of a Proper Countess, which was published by Avon Books in 2011. Set in the Regency period, it follows the widowed Countess Isobel Maitland, who is kept as a virtual prisoner by her husband's family until she meets Lord Blackwood, a known scoundrel who is secretly a government spy. A lover of fairy tales, Cornwall approached the story as a hybrid of Cinderella and The Scarlet Pimpernel. Publishers Weekly stated that the novel had \\"just the right blend of mystery, manners, and passion,\\" with \\"truly nefarious villains, plenty of action, and a dash of glamour\\" that made it \\"a seductive read.\\" Avon Books published her novella, All the Pleasures of the Season, in 2011. One of Cornwall's first Regency story drafts was later published in 2012 as How to Deceive a Duke. Publishers Weekly opined that the chemistry of the novel's two protagonists \\"will draw the reader into a fast- paced novel that travels from the English countryside and London to the battle of Waterloo.\\" In 2013, Avon published her sixth work, Once Upon a Highland Summer.

It was named after Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta, the national mosque of Indonesia, since the mosque was the gift from Indonesian people and government for Bosnia and Herzegovina as a token of solidarity and friendship between two nations. The name \\"istiqlal\\" is Arabic word for \\"independence\\", thus it is also meant to commemorate the independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is also colloquially known as \\"Indonesian mosque\\" or \\"Suharto mosque\\", as the credit to the initiator of the mosque construction. Activities Other than its regular function as a house of prayers; the regular daily 5 times salat and other prayers (Jumu'ah and Eids), Istiqlal mosque also host Mekteb, the religious lessons also Al Quran recital competitions for children and adults. The mosque also served as Project Bureau Center for Islamic Architecture, arranging Sharia weddings, and also as Indonesian Cultural Center. History During his visit to the war torn city of Sarajevo in March 1995 and paid a courtesy call to Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic, Indonesian President Suharto contemplating an idea to build a mosque in the city as a gift for the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Suharto mobilized his administrations to realize his idea, and appointing Fauzan Noe‚Äôman, one of Indonesia's foremost architect to design the mosque and proceed with the project. Noe'man was known for his works in constructing grand mosque of Batam, Baiturrahim mosque in Merdeka Palace complex, and also At-Tin mosque (1999) in East Jakarta near Taman Mini Indonesia Indah. The project is started in 1995, however because the turmoil in Indonesia led to the fall of Suharto in 1998 has stalled the construction process. The mosque was completed and inaugurated in September 2001 by Indonesian Minister of Religious Affairs Said Agil Al Munawar. A year later in September 2002 during her stately visit to Sarajevo, President Megawati Soekarnoputri also visited the mosque. Architecture The Istiqlal mosque of Sarajevo demonstrate postmodern interpretation of Islamic architecture as viewed from Indonesian perspective. The mosque built with simple geometric elements and patterns on metal-works made from stainless steel or aluminum and glass blocks applied on facade, windows and arches. The exterior were covered with white tiles, while the interior, especially in mihrab, minbar and window frames were adorned with Indonesian wooden carving of floral ornaments. Built on 2,800 square meters land on Otoka on western side of the city, the mosque is one among the largest mosque in Sarajevo and easily recognizable as the landmark in the neighborhood. The mosque has a single copper-colored dome measured 27 meters tall and 27 meters in diameter. The dome is equipped with three horizontal openings around the dome to allow natural lights to enter the mosque's interior beneath the dome. This type of dome is similar to those of At-Tin mosque in Jakarta, also designed by Fauzan Noe‚Äôman. Two twin towers flanking the entrance with reminiscent of Iranian iwan facade style. The tower height is 48 meters. The tip of the dome and twin towers are adorned with three spherical pinnacles with star and crescent on top of it. The twin towers symbolize two nations, as the mosque represents the friendship and solidarity between Indonesia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

On 27 June 2012, local media reported that Lin had accepted a bribe of NT$63 million from Chen Chi-hsiang in exchange for helping his Dih Yeon Mineral Selection Company secure a contract from China Steel Corporation in 2010. The Taipei District Court sentenced Lin to seven years and four months in prison, stripped him of civil rights for five years, and ordered him to pay a fine of NT$15.8 million. Lin appealed the ruling to the Taiwan High Court, which lengthened his prison term to 13 years and six months. A subsequent appeal to the Supreme Court found Lin guilty of \\"holding properties of unknown origin,\\" for which he was issued a sentence of two years imprisonment.

The twin pregnancy was terminated. Archbishop Jos√© Sobrinho affirmed that the girl's mother and the doctors who performed the abortion had been automatically excommunicated under Canon Law. This prompted an array of national and international criticism for the Archbishop's actions. In response, the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil declared that no one was excommunicated in the case, and in an article published on L'Osservatore Romano a Vatican bioethicist rebuked the archbishop for the girls dad public statement. Law ;Brazilian penal law Abortion is legal under Brazilian law in cases of pregnancies resulting from rape or in which giving birth would endanger the mother's life. ;Canon law The Code of Canon Law says that automatic excommunication is imposed on \\"a person who procures a completed abortion\\" (Canon 1398), but not if, for instance, the act was done \\"by a person who was coerced by grave fear, even if only relatively grave, or due to necessity or grave inconvenience unless the act is intrinsically evil or tends to the harm of souls\\".Code of Canon Law, canon 1323 ¬ß4 The abortion Doctors in Recife performed an abortion on the nine- year-old girl on 4 March 2009. They judged her life to be at risk because of her age and because she was pregnant with twins and weighed 80 pounds. According to Fatima Maia, the director of the hospital CISAM, if the pregnancy continued, the child could suffer a ruptured uterus and hemorrhage, and she also ran the risk of diabetes, hypertension, eclampsia and lifelong sterility.‚ÄúEquipe m√©dica excomungada diz que n√£o est√° arrependida‚ÄùEstad√£o, 06 March 2009 She had allegedly been raped by her stepfather.Nine-Year-Old's Abortion Outrages Brazil's Catholic Church, Time, 6 Mar. 2009  Sobrinho's view and actions  As well as expressly denying that he had excommunicated anyone, but had only said that excommunication had been automatically incurred,Expresso,\\"Menina violada abortou e a m√£e foi excomungada: Toda a pol√©mica\\", 14 March 2009\\"Arcebispo: n√£o dei excomunh√£o; a lei da Igreja pune quem faz aborto\\" (interview granted to Terra Magazine) Sobrinho said that \\"the law of God is higher than any human laws. When a human law‚Äîthat is, a law enacted by human legislators‚Äîis against the law of God, that law has no value. The adults who approved, who carried out this abortion have incurred excommunication.\\" In an interview, he added: \\"They took the life of an innocent. Abortion is much more serious than killing an adult. An adult may or may not be an innocent, but an unborn child is most definitely innocent. Taking that life cannot be ignored.\\" Sobrinho explained that the rapist stepfather was not excommunicated because abortion, the taking of an innocent life, is even worse than rape. The girl was not excommunicated, because minors are exempt from excommunication. Archbishop Sobrinho and his diocese also tried to prevent the abortion by approaching the child's parents, the State Governor and the hospital where she was first admitted, after which it put off the abortion indefinitely. His lawyers then issued legal threats against the second hospital where the abortion finally took place.Muriel Fraser, \\"An Abortion in Brazil: The Case That Saved a Life and Divided the Vatican\\", Conscience XXXV - No.1, 2014 - Catholics for Choice  Government reaction  President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, a Catholic, criticized what he called the \\"conservative attitude\\" of the Archbishop in a case where the doctors were trying to save the girl's life, adding: \\"In this case, the medical profession was more right than the Church.\\" Health Minister Jos√© Gomes Tempor√£o described what he called the Catholic Church's position as \\"extreme, radical and inadequate\\". Tempor√£o, who had frequently clashed with the Church on questions such as abortion and state distribution of free condoms, called on the participants in a national convention on women's health to acknowledge the \\"brilliant\\" work done by the medical team who performed the abortion.  Church hierarchy's view  =National Conference of Bishops of Brazil= The National Conference of Bishops of Brazil repudiated Sobrinho's initiative. At a press conference, Bishop Dimas Lara Barbosa, Secretary General of the Conference, said that the girl's mother was not excommunicated, since she had acted under pressure to save her daughter's life, and that there were no grounds to declare the doctors excommunicated, because (automatic) excommunication depended on each one's degree of awareness and only those who were \\"aware and contumacious\\" were excommunicated. At the press conference, a document on excommunication written by canonist Enrique P√©rez Pujol, who stressed that the penalty should not be applied amid a polemic, was distributed to journalists. Archbishop Geraldo Lyrio Rocha, President of the Conference, avoided answering a question whether Sobrinho had acted hastily in saying that automatic excommunication had occurred. He said that \\"at no time did he want to hurt someone who was already hurting, but only wished to draw attention to the gravity of the deed of abortion in the face of a certain permissiveness regarding the life of the unborn\\". He said that Sobrinho had excommunicated no one, but had pointed out that abortion entails the possibility of excommunication, which is a measure intended to make not only an individual but the whole Church community take note of the gravity of the deed. As for the rapist, he said that a rapist \\"is outside of communion\\" and \\"in grave mortal sin\\", even though rape is not listed among the crimes that give rise to automatic excommunication. He said: \\"Rape is something so repugnant that the Church does not need to call attention to it. It is punished by the state justice system, which does not punish abortion so much.\\" He said that talk of excommunication seemed to have made people forget the crime of the rapist, who needed to be punished. =Rino Fisichella= The Holy See's non-official newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano, published a front-page article on 15 March by Archbishop Rino Fisichella, President of the Pontifical Academy for Life, that was highly critical of Sobrinho's action. Fisichella said that excommunication was automatic, so that focusing on it rather than on helping and supporting the child victim showed a lack of compassion that detracted from the credibility of the Church's anti-abortion teaching. After reiterating the church's condemnation of abortion, he wrote that the moral situation was difficult because of the girl's young age and the risk to her life and praised those who \\"allowed [her] to live and will help [her] to recover hope and trust\\". He wrote: \\"The conscience of the physician finds itself alone when forced to decide the best thing to do. A choice like that of having to save a life, knowing that one puts a second at serious risk, never comes easily.\\" The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith responded to press coverage of Fisichella's article calling it manipulation and exploitation. It issued a clarification that the article did not signal a change of doctrine and said that \\"the Church's teaching on procured abortion has not changed, nor can it change\\".Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, \\"Clarification on procured abortion\\"The Holy Office Teaches Archbishop Fisichella a Lesson The clergy of the Archdiocese of Olinda and Recife took issue with Fisichella, stating that the local Church had been supportive of the girl and her mother. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ruled that Sobrinho had acted \\"with all pastoral solicitude\\". The members of the Academy gave Fisichella a vote of no confidence because of his article, and he was reassigned in the next year to the Pontifical Council for Promoting the New Evangelization. =Others= Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops and President of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America, deplored what he called an attack on the Church in Brazil: \\"It is a sad case, but the real problem is that the twins conceived were two innocent persons, who had the right to live and could not be eliminated. Life must always be protected. The attack on the Brazilian church is unjustified.\\" He added that excommunication of those who performed the abortion was just. Bishop Jean-Michel di Falco of Gap, France, criticized what he saw as the un- Christlike nature of Sobrinho's statement. He said that bishops should act as pastors rather than executioners. As had the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil, he denied the applicability of Canon 1398 of the Code of Canon Law to the girl's mother, because such an automatic excommunication does not apply to someone who acts out of grave fear.Mgr di FALCO, √©v√™que de Gap, sur l'excommunication au Br√©sil  Other reactions  On 9 March 2009, Health Minister Tempor√£o interrupted the opening ceremony of a national medical convention on women's health in Bras√≠lia in order to compliment Dr. Ol√≠mpio Moraes, one of the doctors who carried out the abortion and who was in attendance. Participants gave Moraes a standing ovation. Moraes expressed gratitude to Sobrinho for the excommunication, which, he said, had drawn attention to Brazil's restrictive abortion laws. Another of the doctors involved said that he will continue attending Mass, \\"praying, conversing with God, and asking him to illuminate me and my colleagues in our medical team to help us take care of people in similar cases.\\" The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, in its January 2014 assessment of the Holy See's compliance with the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, cited this Brazil case. It \\"urge[d] the Holy See to review its position on abortion which places obvious risks on the life and health of pregnant girls and to amend Canon 1398 relating to abortion with a view to identifying circumstances under which access to abortion services can be permitted.\\"Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights: Concluding observations on the second periodic report of the Holy See, 31 January 2014, retrieved 8 February 2014 See also *Pa√≠s do Desejo *Catholic Church and abortion *Abortion debate References Category:Abortion in Brazil Category:Child sexual abuse in Brazil Category:Catholic Church in Brazil Category:Catholic Church and abortion Category:People excommunicated by the Catholic Church Category:Preteen pregnancy Abortion ","title":"2009 Brazilian girl abortion case"},{"id":"39771441","text":"Rola El Haress (; born March 5, 1983) is a Lebanese former swimmer, who specialized in sprint freestyle events.

History First mentioned in the Liber Census Daniae in 1241, the manor's thick and irregular walls suggest that the building was originally a medieval vassal stronghold. The first known owner of the manor was a vassal of the Danish King Gerhardus de Kouwe (Gerhard from Kau) who was the mayor of Kau in 1319. Since no one knows what became of this family, historians believe that Gerhardus participated the failed 1343 uprising of St. George‚Äôs Night and lost the Manor during the suppression of the Estonians in the aftermath. However, Kau has been a home to warriors, artists, explorers and statesmen ever since. A renowned warlord Heinrich D√ºcker owned Kau during the Livonian War in the 1560s. The Head of the Estonian Noble Corporation Tonnies Wrangell lived here at the end of 16th century. In the early 19th century Kau was the home to a world-famous explorer, Otto von Kotzebue. In 1906 it became a by-manor of nearby Paunk√ºla, owned by the von Hagemeister family. Triigi manor remained in their possession until its expropriation by the newly independent Republic of Estonia in 1919. In the 1920s and 1930s Kau was owned by a War of Independence hero, the head of Estonian Military Intelligence Colonel Karl Laurits. In 1975, the house was abandoned and left to decay for several decades. In 2007, Mary Jordan and Eerik-Niiles Kross acquired the manor house. Although only a relic of its former self, Mary and Eerik were intrigued by the rich history of the place. Mary‚Äîan acclaimed filmmaker and artist‚Äîsaw the manor's potential and committed herself to breathing new life into the house. Main building The oldest part of the main building may date back to medieval manorhouse, refer to thick infrequent walls. The main building was built in several stages between the 14th and 19th centuries. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the main building was ornamented with lavish Baroque decorations. The classical appearance of the main building has survived to the present day.

As an incentive to Hong Kong athletes‚Äô persistent excellent achievements in international and regional events, the sports and corporations aspired to set up a reward mechanism to encourage Hong Kong sports elites and teams to strive for excellence in the games; to encourage Hong Kong young people to regard them as role models; and to promote sports for all people in order to develop Hong Kong sports culture. In view of this, the inaugural ‚ÄúHong Kong Sports Stars Awards‚Äù was set up in 1986. History =Corporate Organisers (1986~1992)= In November 1986, nominations from the ASF&OC; member associations were accepted for the inaugural ‚ÄúHong Kong Sports Stars Awards‚Äù, the first awards of this kind in Hong Kong sport history. There were 44 finalists, and 6 winners were announced in April 1987. The inaugural Awards were presented by Swire Coca-Cola HK Ltd. and co-organised by the ASF&OC;, the Council for Recreation and Sport, the Urban Council and the Regional Council. Due to the restrictions of the Olympic Committee‚Äôs principle of amateurism, the grants of HKD$6,000 for the athletes could only be used for the development of their affiliated sports programmes. The 2nd Award Ceremony was held in 1987, with grants raised to HKD$10,000. A lucky draw was added for the voters, and the champion was awarded a pure gold commemorative medallion. The 3rd Award Ceremony was held in collaboration between the organiser and the Jubilee Sports Centre so that winning athletes were awarded free membership to use the sports science utilities and medical facilities at the Jubilee Sports Centre. A ‚ÄúWall of Honors for Outstanding Athletes‚Äù was also set up at the Jubilee Sports Centre on 6 January 1989. In addition, the organisers set up the ‚ÄúHong Kong Junior Sports Stars Awards‚Äù to award the training fee of HKD$3,000 per winning new talent for six potential young athletes under the age of 18 who had achieved outstanding performances over the previous year. The awarding system was criticized for its defects. The fencing team that won the bronze medal for Hong Kong at the 1990 Asian Games was not listed because the scoring system was unfavorable to team events. As a result, the organiser set up an additional award for teams in 1991. In 1991, the 5th Award Ceremony included a new ‚ÄúBest of the Best‚Äù Award (Best Athlete of the Year Award) . The winner was the then 22-year-old Lee Lai-shan. Wong Kam-po, the gold medallist in Asian Junior Cycling Championships, also won the Junior Sports Star Award for the first time. = Council for Recreation and Sport Joined as Co- organiser (1992~1999)= In 1992, the Council for Recreation and Sport joined as co-organiser for the Award and the then Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten attended to present the awards. The Sports Stars quota was increased from six to ten in 1998, and returned to six in 1999. In the meantime, a voting website was created for public voting. =SF&OC; Succeeded as Organiser= In November 2000, Swire Coca-Cola HK Ltd. announced that it would terminate its role as organiser for the Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards. The role was taken by the SF&OC; and the LCSD, whereas the Hong Kong Sports Development Board took the co-organising role, with the SF&OC; Honorary Secretary General Pang Chung as Chairman of the Organising Committee. To ensure that awards were fairly evaluated, nominations were accepted from all SF&OC; sports associations. To safeguard credibility, the jury comprised a group of experienced sports personalities, local sports media and citizens who voted via the digital interactive phone voting system ‚ÄúSports Stars Awards‚Äù, ‚ÄúJunior Sports Stars Awards‚Äù and ‚ÄúSports Team of the Year Awards‚Äù were retained in this edition of the Awards. Six athletes won in each of the ‚ÄúSports Stars Awards‚Äù and ‚ÄúJunior Sports Stars Awards‚Äù. The Award Ceremony was held at the SF&OC; Annual Spring Dinner on 22 January 2001. The Award Ceremony took the form of a ‚ÄúHong Kong Sports Oscar‚Äù, as expressed in the organisers‚Äô slogan. The SF&OC;‚Äôs Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards 2001 continued the success of the previous year. The Hong Kong Potential Sports Stars Awards and the Hong Kong Best Improvement Sports Stars Awards were added as new initiatives. ‚ÄúHong Kong Well Being Stars Awards‚Äù was added to the Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards 2002 to commend athletes who had shown the Olympic Spirit, fairness in competitions, and sportsmanship in their sports career. Cycling athlete Wong Kam-po was the winner of this award. The 2004 Award Ceremony was organised solely by the SF&OC;, with the SF&OC; Vice President Vivien C.C. Lau as Chair of the Election Organising Committee and the LCSD as co-organiser. The number of winners was increased from six to eight to recognize athletes‚Äô extraordinary achievements in both the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games in Athens. The ‚ÄúSports Team of the Year Awards‚Äù was divided into ‚ÄúTeam Only Sport ‚Äù and ‚ÄúTeam Event ‚Äù Awards. Meanwhile, four of the categories were open for public voting, instead of just one as in the previous year. The categories were Hong Kong Sports Stars Awards, Hong Kong Junior Sports Stars Awards, Hong Kong Sports Stars Award for Team Only Sport, and Hong Kong Sports Stars Award for Team Event. Starting from 2006, title sponsorship was provided by the Bank of China, Hong Kong. In addition, ‚ÄúBest of the Best‚Äù of the Hong Kong Sports Stars Award was resumed. In 2007, So Wa-wai became the champion having broken the world record in the Men‚Äôs T36 Class 200m Sprint in the Beijing Paralympic Games and won 6 gold medals in 4 editions of the Paralympics. He was also world record holder in the Men‚Äôs T36 Class 100m Sprint. For these attainments, So was awarded the ‚ÄúBest of the Best‚Äù Award 2007. He was also the first athlete with a physical disability to be awarded the most prestigious honor. In 2009, Hong Kong successfully hosted the 5th Asian Games. The Hong Kong soccer team clinched the first gold medal in the soccer event and was honoured the Hong Kong Best Team Only Sport Award.

It was triggered by a division of inheritance following the death of the last landgrave of all Hesse, Philip I in 1567. The real conflict, which lasted almost 80 years and spanned three generations, escalated in the 1620s, when the line of Hesse-Marburg died out, and peaked after 1645 in the Hessian War proper. This open warfare began with the Siege of Marburg in 1645 and ended in April 1648 (but before the Treaty of Westphalia which was concluded later that year and ended the Thirty Years' War) with victory going to Hesse-Cassel. In the aftermath, Upper Hesse was divided and parts of its territory went to the now stronger Hesse-Cassel. At a European level the Hessian War must be viewed in the larger context of the Thirty Years' War, in which the reformed Hesse- Cassel sided with the Protestant Swedish party, whilst Hesse-Darmstadt, despite its Lutheran confession joined the Catholic-Imperial alliance. In the course of the war, Hessian mercenaries fought both in the main Hessian lands as well as in Westphalia (Prince-Bishopric of M√ºnster and Paderborn), in Upper Guelders, on the Lower Rhine (Electorate of Cologne), in the Duchy of Brunswick and other places. This conflict should not be confused with the campaign by Landgrave Philip I of Hesse, supported by Prince-Elector John of Saxony against the two Franconian prince-bishoprics of W√ºrzburg and Bamberg in 1528, which is also referred to as the \\"Hessian War\\".  Overview of the belligerents   Course of the war  = Cause and opening phase = Philip I, the last landgrave of all Hesse (died 1567) The cause of the conflict was the division of inheritance following the death of Phillip the Magnanimous in 1567. According to an old house law in the House of Hesse, he had mandated in his will a division of the landgraviate amongst his four sons, whereby the inheritance of Hessian territory was as follows: # His eldest son, William, was given the Lower Principality in the north of Hesse (subsequently referred to as Hesse-Cassel) with the city of Kassel, in all about half of the territory of Hesse. # His second son, Louis, was given Upper Hesse in the centre of Hesse (subsequently referred to as Hesse-Marburg) with the town of Marburg and the fortress of Giessen, about a quarter of Hesse itself. # His third son, Philip (the Younger), was given the Lower County of Katzenelnbogen in the west of Hesse (subsequently referred to as Hesse-Rheinfels) with Rheinfels Castle and Katzenelnbogen, roughly just over one eight of the territory of Hesse. # His youngest son, George, was given the Upper County of Katzenelnbogen in the south of Hesse (subsequently referred to as Hesse- Darmstadt) with the town of Darmstadt, rather less than an eight of Hesse. When the Rheinfels line died out in 1583 Hessen-Rheinfels was divided amongst the three remaining brothers of Philip II. = The dispute over the Marburg inheritance and the Thirty Years' War =  Marburg Inheritance Dispute (from 1604)  Louis IV, the only landgrave of Hesse-Marburg (line died out in 1604) In 1604, Landgrave Louis IV of Hesse-Marburg died without issue at his castle in Marburg. His will envisaged that Hesse-Marburg would be divided equally between the sons of his late brothers, William in Cassel and George in Darmstadt, on the condition, that the whole of Hesse-Marburg continued to follow the Lutheran confession. There was initially a dispute over whether each of the two remaining lines of the family should receive exactly half the territory or whether it should be split according to the number of nephews in each case. Darmstadt would have benefited from the latter interpretation, because George of Hesse-Darmstadt had produced more sons (Louis, Philip (III) and Frederick) than William of Hesse-Cassel with just one heir, Maurice. Following an action for annulment by Hesse-Darmstadt, the matter was decided in favour of Hesse-Cassel by the Aulic Council (Reichshofrat), and Hesse- Marburg was divided in half. In 1605, the dispute over the Marburg inheritance flared up again after Landgrave Maurice of Hesse-Cassel, whose beliefs since his accession in 1592 increasingly moved towards the Calvinistic confession of his wife, Juliana of Nassau-Dillenburg, enacted several Calvinist-oriented laws in his domain and in the same year, converted to Calvinism himself. In the wake of this, many Lutheran priests moved to Hesse-Darmstadt and the Lutheran theologians of the University of Marburg went to the gymnasium illustre in Giessen, which, in 1607 also achieved the status of a university. Because, Maurice, by his conversion to Calvinism had ended the Lutheran unity of Hesse-Marburg, he fell foul of the will of his uncle, thus forfeiting his claim to his portion of Hesse-Marburg in the view of Hesse-Darmstadt. Darmstadt was at this point in time neither politically nor militarily strong enough to be able to pursue its claim to the whole of Hesse-Marburg.  The rise of Hesse-Darmstadt to the Hauptakkord (1618‚Äì1627)  Louis V of Hesse- Darmstadt (died 1626) Maurice of Hesse-Cassel (abdicated in 1627) Battle of H√∂chst (1622) During the Thirty Years' War, or more precisely War over Electoral Palatine, Louis V of Hesse-Darmstadt initially remained neutral but, despite the fact that his state embraced the Lutheran confession, he increasingly sided with the Roman Catholic emperor, whilst the Calvinist Hesse-Cassel fought with the Protestant Union. After the Protestant Duke Christian of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel had invaded Upper Hesse in 1621, Louis V openly allied himself with the emperor in the hope of receiving military support. This gamble l paid off in the medium term: in 1621 the imperial Field Marshal Ambrosio Spinola occupied the Wetterau. In reply, the commander of the Protestant army, Ernst von Mansfeld, counter-attacked the Darmstadt upper county on orders of Prince-Elector Frederick of the Palatinate. In doing so he succeeded in taking Louis V of Hesse-Darmstadt and his son, John, prisoner. In exchange for the release of the hostages he was given the fortress of R√ºsselsheim. During his withdrawal from Russelsheim, however, Mansfeld was defeated on 10 June 1622 in the battle on the Lorsch Heath by imperial general, Tilly. A few weeks earlier, on 27 April 1622 in the Battle of Mingolsheim, Mansfeld had triumphed against Tilly, but achieved no great advantage from his victory. In the meantime, Tilly had grown in strength following his victory at the Battle of Wimpfen on 6 May 1622. Tilly defeated Mansfeld on 20 June 1622, as well as Duke Christian of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel in the Hessian region at H√∂chst am Main in the Battle of H√∂chst, as a result of which the Protestant side was significantly weakened. Tilly advanced again against Hesse-Cassel and occupied all of Lower Hesse as far as the city of Cassel. As a result, he enforced the Aulic Council's judgement of 11 April 1623, that the entire heritage of Hesse-Marburg (including all tax revenue from it, retroactively) should go to the Darmstadt line. Tilly also occupied several Lower Hessian offices as a security. Even the former county of Katzenelenbogen was seized from Darmstadt. Landgrave Louis V died during the campaign. His son, George II, took over the reins of power in Darmstadt and continued the fight against Cassel. Because of military defeats and abject government by Landgrave Maurice of Hesse-Cassel, the Lower Hess estates openly rebelled against him and forced his abdication in 1627. The House of Cassel also lost Hesse-Rotenburg (the so-called Rotenburger Quart) thanks to Maurice's division of his inheritance. Thus weakened, Maurice's son and heir, William V, was forced to accept the judgment of the Aulic Council in 1623 and cede the disputed territories. On 24 September 1627 a settlement was reached, the so-called Hauptakkord. The whole of Upper Hesse, the Lower County of Katzenelnbogen and the Barony of Schmalkalden, a Hessian exclave in Thuringia, went to Hesse-Darmstadt. In addition, Hesse-Cassel and Hesse-Darmstadt were granted the same level of precedence in the German Empire. In return, Hesse- Cassel was given back the territories in Lower Hesse that had been held as a security. Following the Edict of Restitution of 1629 Hesse-Cassel was also given the Imperial Abbey of Hersfeld, which had been under Lower Hessian rule since 1604.  The rise of Hesse-Cassel in the Swedish War (1630‚Äì1634)  George II of Hesse-Darmstadt William V of Hesse-Cassel (died 1637) After the total defeat of the House of Hesse-Cassel had been averted by the Hauptakkord, in 1627 William V began secretly waiver, to build a new mercenary army, under the cover of his apparent renunciation. The turning point for Hesse-Cassel in the Thirty Years' War came in October 1630 when William V became the first German Protestant prince to ally himself with King Gustavus II Adolphus of Sweden (also a great-grandson of Philip I and thus a cousin of William V). After the alliance was formally sealed on 22 August 1631 in the Treaty of Werben (in the wake of the Battle of Werben), Hesse-Cassel placed its army in the service of the Swedish king. In return, Gustavus Adolphus held out the prospect to Cassel that they could expand their territory by conquest. With the political and military support of the Protestant alliance under the leadership of the Swedish king and thanks to the skillful leadership of William V, who himself went to war as a general, in the period that followed the Lower Hessian troops achieved considerable military success. As a start, they succeeded in driving the imperial occupiers out of Hesse-Cassel. On 24 August 1631, Hersfeld was conquered and, on 9 September 1631, the town of Fritzlar that belonged to the Electorate of Mainz. The imperial troops were further weakened by their defeat in the Battle of Breitenfeld and came under pressure. By mounting diversionary attacks on Mainz positions in the Taunus, Hesse-Cassel supported the Swedish advance on Erfurt, W√ºrzburg and Hanau to Frankfurt and Mainz. The hopes of Lower Hesse to recover their lost territories in Upper Hesse, as a reward for their support of Sweden, were not, however, fulfilled. After George II of Hesse-Darmstadt had concluded negotiations with the Swedish king, he succeeded in gaining recognition of the neutrality of Hesse-Darmstadt at the Treaty of H√∂chst on 29 November 1631, in exchange for giving up the fortress of R√ºsselsheim, so that Darmstadt was able to keep its territories in Upper Hesse. Instead, on 28 February 1632, Gustavus Adolphus granted Hesse-Cassel several other areas outside of Hesse that the Lower Hessian troops had conquered earlier on Swedish orders (including the Fulda Abbey, the Bishopric of Paderborn and Corvey Abbey) or intended to capture (the Bishopric of M√ºnster, later substituted by the Swedish Chancellor Oxenstierna for parts of the Duchy of Westphalia and Vest Recklinghausen).  Advance by the Emperor on Hesse-Cassel from 1634  After the Battle of L√ºtzen in November 1632, in which the Swedish-Protestant side suffered great losses and King Gustavus Adolphus was killed, the fortunes of war turned against the Protestants, including Hesse-Cassel. Following their defeat in the Battle of N√∂rdlingen in September 1634 the Protestant Alliance crumbled. The Calvinist Hesse-Cassel could not comply with the Treaty of Prague of 1635 as a result of excessive demands from Darmstadt, which insisted on the annexation of the whole of Hesse-Cassel. Later it fought once again on the Swedish and French side against the Emperor and the Imperial Princes because of the uncompromising politics of the imperial court. On the opposing side, Hesse- Darmstadt had given up its neutrality and fought openly again for the Emperor. Both sides scored successes. For example, Darmstadt won the County of Isenburg-B√ºdingen and the Electoral Palatine Amt of Caub. On 13 June 1636, Cassel ended a nine-month blockade of the fortress of Hanau with a victory over the imperial army commander, Lamboy. But neither side won a decisive victory. In response to his victory over the imperial troops in Hanau and his alliance with France, William V of Hesse-Cassel was outlawed on 19 August 1636 by the electors at Regensburg. His adversary from Darmstadt was appointed administrator over all of Hesse. However, because of the military stalemate, the ban was initially ineffective. Because even after more than two decades, no end to the confrontation was in sight and the whole of Hesse was suffering badly from the consequences of the war, more so than almost any other region in Germany, in February 1637 the Landst√§nde, or knightly estates, from all parts of Hesse organized a Landtag to seek a mediation between their lords. But this arbitration parliament was not successful because, in parallel, the newly elected Emperor Ferdinand III, also King of Croatia, had already sent several regiments of Croatian troops to Lower Hesse to the enforce the ban against William V. During their campaign the Croats devastated large parts of Lower Hesse and also threatened to take Cassel. In this situation, William V fled with his family and a large part of his army to East Frisia, where he was granted refuge by Ulrich II of East Frisia following mediation by the states- general. There, in the encampment at Leer, he died from disease on 21 September 1637.  Resurgence of Hesse-Cassel in the Swedish-Prussian War (from 1637)  Amalie Elisabeth, regent of Hesse-Cassel in 1637 Because William's son, William VI was only eight years old at the time of his father's death, William V appointed his wife Amalie Elisabeth in his will as a guardian for his under-age heir and thus as regent of Hesse-Cassel. In a coup, she had the Emperor and Darmstadt pay homage to her infant son who was not subject to the ban. Elisabeth Amalie proved a skilful tactician, who succeeded in spite of her extremely difficult starting position in consolidating the position of Hesse-Cassel. First she agreed an apparent truce with the Emperor and so kept Cassel from being conquered by the Imperial Croatian forces. Then she built a powerful army again based on the cadre of troops that her husband had taken to Frisia. Furthermore, in 1639 at Dorsten, she concluded an alliance with France, represented by Cardinal Richelieu, and Sweden; and, later, another alliance with Duke Bernard of Saxe-Weimar. In 1639, with her new allies behind her, Amalie Elisabeth's troops moved in greater strength against the Electorate of Cologne in order to defend the already conquered electoral territories (promised by Sweden in return for giving up Upper Hesse), especially in the area of Vest Recklinghausen, and to capture other domains besides. In 1641 Hesse-Cassel lost the town of Dorsten in Vest Recklinghausen, which they had seized in 1633, to troops of the Imperial Army and Electorate of Cologne after a siege lasting several weeks. This was the most important Hessian position on the right bank of Lower Rhine. But after the imperial forces partially withdrew to fight in other regions (especially Wolfenb√ºttel), Hesse-Kassel embarked on a campaign in the electoral lands on the left bank of the Rhine. At the Battle of Kempen Heath Hesse-Cassel, with the support of French and Weimar troops, dealt the Imperial forces a heavy defeat. In the wake of this defeat, large areas in the north of the Electorate, including the Duchy of Berg, and even parts of the neutral Duchy of J√ºlich fell under the occupation of Hesse-Cassel. = The Hessian War in its narrower sense (1645‚Äì1648) = Inspired by military and diplomatic successes in the Rhineland and Westphalia, Landgravine Amalia Elisabeth of Hesse-Cassel felt strong enough to take up the fight for the Marburg inheritance in 1644. She had the Hauptakkord treaty of 1627, in which Hesse-Cassel had forfeited Upper Hesse, invalidated by a subsequent legal ruling and, at the end of 1645, sent her battle-hardened troops led by John of Geyso towards Marburg. After a short siege of Marburg and Butzbach and their surrender, the majority of Upper Hesse fell again under the rule of Kassel in early 1646. In 1647, an imperial army under the command of General Melander, who had recently switched sides from Cassel to Darmstadt, succeeded in recovering the town of Marburg - but not its castle. But because the town of Darmstadt and the Upper County was attacked in turn by French troops under the command of Marshal Turenne shortly thereafter, this success was short-lived. By the end of 1647, troops from Cassel had re- occupied the majority of Lower and Upper Hesse and the Lower County of Katzenelnbogen. In early 1648, Melander's troops withdrew from Marburg. The Hessian War was finally permanently settled by negotiations, that took place in parallel with the Westphalian Peace Congress mediated by Duke Ernest of Saxe-Gotha and which resulted in a unification and peace treaty that was sealed in April 1648, ahead of the Treaty of Westphalia itself. Before the Westphalian Peace Treaty, Cassel fought one last time against the imperial side, winning the Battle of Wevelinghoven in the Rhineland, together with other Protestant troops. Darmstadt, however, was not involved in this battle. Under the Unification Treaty between Cassel and Darmstadt, Upper Hesse was permanently divided. Darmstadt had to give up a significant part of Upper Hesse to Cassel, not least Marburg and other occupied territories, including the Lower County of Katzenelnbogen and the Barony of Schmalkalden.

The park includes over 200 folk art sculptures built with concrete and decorated with glass bottles and other found objects. Fred Smith, who ran the Rock Garden Tavern on the property, began building the sculptures in 1948 after retiring from his career as a lumberjack. Smith, who lacked any formal artistic education, initially built two-dimensional bas relief plaques and eventually transitioned to constructing his larger sculptures. Smith continued building sculptures until 1964, when a stroke forced him to stop working. Smith claimed that the sculptures \\"came to [him] naturally\\" and that \\"nobody knows why I made these sculptures, even me.\\" The sculptures primarily feature people engaging in everyday activities, such as farming, watching workers, and drinking beer. Animals are also frequently depicted, both in the wild and helping with farm work. One sculpture, the last Smith completed before his stroke, features a team of Clydesdales pulling a Budweiser wagon. Historic and legendary figures such as Ben-Hur, Paul Bunyan, and Abraham Lincoln are also depicted. Smith was born in 1886 in Price County (the same county as his park) to German immigrants. Beginning in his early teens, he worked as a lumberjack. In 1903 he homesteaded the property where the concrete park stands today. In addition to woods-work, Fred raised ginseng and Christmas trees on his farm. When his first house burned in 1921, he had the current house built. The house is fairly standard Craftsman style, except for the \\"rock garden room,\\" in which Smith constructed a 23-foot brick trough with running water, mica-flecked fish pond, crosscut saw blades, and rock garden. Some time between 1922 and the 1940s he added a rock garden outside, with raised beds in various shapes. In 1936, he and local stonemasons Albert and John Raskie built the Rock Garden Tavern, where he entertained visitors with tall tales and musical performances where he jumped from table to table with bells on his legs, playing a mandolin or fiddle. He began creating the concrete sculptures after retiring in 1948, and gradually transformed the outdoor rock garden into the concrete park, until his stroke in 1964. After Smith's death in 1976, a storm damaged over 70% of the figures. The Kohler Foundation rehabilitated the park and donated it to Price County, and the land is now a county park. The restoration was carried out by sculptors Don Howlett and Sharron Quasius. The park was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 28, 2005.

Sairme mineral water is used for drinking and bottling. There is a sanatorium in Sairme.The Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1979)  History  The first mention of the waters Sairme was found in the sources of the 1890s. According to popular legends among the people, two brothers - the hunters who were pursuing the trail of a wounded deer found water Sairme. Water flowed over the stones red with oxide and all around it was white with salt. Deer often came here for salt and water. They called the water Sairme because of their number (the origin of the name comes from the Georgian word ·Éò·É†·Éî·Éõ·Éò, which in translation means \\"deer\\"). Shepherds also paid attention to this area because of the amazing events. They noticed that in a place that was at a distance of about 3 km from the source of deer, grass was steady green, the snows never lie, and the earth was already dry in a few minutes after the rain. The veil of mystery of a magic glade was filmed in the 20th century when geologists discovered hot mineral water in the land. The first attempt of a scientific study of water Sairme is associated with the name of Baghdad doctor Kelenjeradze. In 1912 while still a student, he took a sample for analysis to St. Petersburg. The first chemical analysis of mineral water was held by professors of Petersburg Military Academy. They were vividly interested with a sample sent from the possession of Eristavi in Petersburg. In subsequent years Latvian scientist Robert Kuptsis studied the mineral waters Sairme. On the orders of Emperor Nicholas II he studied mineral waters of the Caucasus, particularly Georgia. = Bottling and production = The use of Sairme water began in 1893. Mineral water was mainly poured predominantly in the barn, where it was brought by horses. For the first time they began to pour the water on the factory rules in 1945. In 1954 the construction of the plant was completed. Since that time 400,000 untreated water in liter bottles were released. Later the plant was equipped with a water production system, which changed little by little and become more modernized. During the collapse of the Soviet Union and the introduction of socialist system the work of the plant was stopped. Since 1998, after the privatization, they began a modernization of the plant and care for the return of the popularity and their consumers; the interior and facade of the building was updated. Since 2010 there have been significant changes in the factory Sairme: a complete re-inventory was made; a mineral water bottling mechanism has changed; the plant was equipped with automated manufacturing facilities and computer technology. The laboratory was completely renovated and water quality is regularly tested there, the process of casting a bottle is also strictly controlled.  Sources of Sairme  Sairme flows in several streams/water well in the resort and nearby territories. They differ from one another in their chemical composition and healing properties. Currently two types of water are bottled:¬∑ * Sparkling mineral medical-table water \\"Sairme\\" - (glass-0.5 L 0.3 L; PET- 0.5 L, l L, 2 L)¬∑ * Natural drinking non-carbonated (still) water \\"Springs of Sairme\\" - (glass -0.5 L; PET- 0.5 L, 1,5 L) The water is rich in calcium bicarbonate, which strengthens the skeletal system and helps to stop the inflammatory process. Carbonated mineral water is used for restoring the function of the liver, urinary tract, kidney and gastrointestinal tract. It promotes the breakdown of harmful substances formed as a result of metabolism. Sairme Springs ‚Äì (not carbonated) is used in medical procedures as well as in cosmetology.

Life in Latvia under the Czars Wulffius (n√©e Nadezhda Krivko) was born in Russian ruled Latvia in September 1899 during the reign of the last Romanov Czar Nicholas II. She was the daughter of Fyodor Krivko and Countess Kladiya Alekseyeva-Yaroslavskeya. She recalls in a 1986 Interview with Margita Chudziak the events of her early life. The Imperial Ballet School Wulffius as a child saw \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" done in the German style and this made a deep impression on her and she began to desire to be a dancer. Her parents and aristocratic grandmother were opposed to her becoming a Ballet dancer as it was not considered respectable for a girl of noble origins. However she persisted and due to the fact that on her father's side she had a peasant grandfather she was given permission. Wulffius was firstly instructed by Marietta Balbo a famous former dancer with the Italian Ballet who taught private students in her studio in Latvia. She eventually convinced her family to allow her to enrol in the Maryinski Theatre (Imperial Ballet School) in St Petersburg when she was about 12 or 13. Unlike the other students she was able to travel back and forth from her home in Latvia to St Petersburg for extended periods of time. Wulffius was taught by Maria Anderson in the lower classes and by Olga Preobrajenska in the higher classes. She recalls Wulffius remained at the Imperial Ballet School and the Petersburg University until 1922, when she fled Communist Russia for newly independent Latvia. A Return to Latvia In Riga she joined the Latvian Theatre where she danced under the name of Mirceva.Mentioned as staging the Dances in a 1923 production http://www.lcb.lv/cd/Latgales%20Zinas%201934/LatgalesZinas1934-11.pdf She also taught at the Riga University. Her dancing name was based on her surname from her first marriage to Mario Marceva‚ÄìMarcenos a Greek mountain engineer and a son of a Greek Ambassador. This first husband escaped Russia at the time of the Revolution via Vladivostok and sailed around Asia but died off the coast of Constantinople on the way to his parents home in Athens. Her second husband was a German Opera singer called Conrad Henzel. Wulffius' parents, who are believed to have lived at Ruskulova Manor in the Salnevas area of Latgale,Along to the more beautiful places of the North Latgale http://balticlakes.com/en/routes/latgale/zlatgale?print=1 had left Latvia after its independence and returned to Russian territory in Vitebsk and lived hidden among the peasants until the rise of Stalin when they were killed by the Communists. Two of her brothers (Constantine and Nicolai) who had been Czarist officers were sent into battle in the front lines to be killed in a war against Finland. Wulffius also had another brother (Vladimir) and sister (Alexandra) who died when they were children. Wulffius was friends with the writer Lev Urvancov (Leo Urvantzov) who loosely based his character Vera Mirceva on her and an incident in her life. She would visit Urvancov in Paris until his death in 1929. She strongly disagreed with him about his belief that Anna Anderson was the Grand Duchess Anastasia. Wulffius told her family that she had been a liberal socialist in her younger days as a student whose hope was for Russia to become a democratic constitutional monarchy. The murder of the Tsar and Royal Family which she claimed to have learnt about while travelling on a train shocked her and after this she became anti-communist. In the 1930s she spied on ex-pat communists on behalf of the Latvian government using the name of Vera Mirceva and posing as a Czech socialist. She spied on the communists in Spain during the civil war during her vacations.https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/spanjews.pdf Wulffius was a follower of Rudolf Steiner and claimed to have visited him in Switzerland in the 1920s. She also recounted a story about a visit to the Karnak Temple in Egypt (probably in the 1930s) when she sailed with a certain Prince on his yacht to Egypt and down the Nile where she had to travel on a donkey as she could not ride the camel. She claimed to have met a group of women from a village who still claimed to preserve some of the ancient dances of Egypt. She later taught these to her ballet students in Australia and the performance was reported in the newspaper.As told to family and reported in a Western Australian newspaper Her third husband was a Latvian-German Baron Alf- Paul Oscar Wulffius (Vulffius/ Vulfiushttp://www.daba.gov.lv/upload/File/DAPi_apstiprin/DP_Numernes_valnis-05.pdf) of Salnavas, Latvia.LUDZAS RAJONS SALNAVAS PAGASTS http://www.pirtslietas.lv/web/?id=401067 He was killed by the Communists during the Second World War (1941). At this time Wulffius was living in Daugavpils and according to her son Paul his father was living with a pianist who was his father's mistress. It seemed to be an amicable arrangement with Wulffius staying with them both when she was in Riga. This may be the Galina Vulfius (b.1912) mentioned as being taken by the communists with Alf-Paul in 1941. Wulffius also at this time (1941) had a Ballet School in Daugavpils, Latvia. Bernard Levinson mentions her under the name of Madam Mirceva in his article titled \\"August in Latvia (For Maja Abramowitch)\\" at the time of the German invasion of Latvia. He uses quotes from the book of a Holocaust survivor Maja Abramovitch titled \\"To Forgive but not to Forget\\" (2002). Wulffius under the name of N.Mircevas is also mentioned in Daugavpils in 1934,http://www.lcb.lv/cd/Latgales%20Zinas%201934/LatgalesZinas1934-11.pdf 1936http://www.lcb.lv/cd/Latgales%20Vestnesis%201936/Latgales%20Vestnesis%201936-31.pdf and 1937 in regards to the Ballethttp://lira.lanet.lv:8991/F/?func=direct&doc;_number=001689920&local;_base=nba01 and she (as N. Mirceva) and her Ballet School performances is mentioned again in the same Journal in 1938http://www.lcb.lv/cd/Latgales%20Vestnesis%201937-1939/data/1938/Latgales_Vestnesis_1938_N099.pdf and 1939.http://www.lcb.lv/cd/Latgales%20Vestnesis%201937-1939/data/1939/Latgales_Vestnesis_1939_N030.pdf and http://www.lcb.lv/cd/Latgales%20Vestnesis%201937-1939/data/1939/Latgales_Vestnesis_1939_N033.pdf Wulffius fled to Germany with her son where she lived until she came to Australia in 1953. Her son Herman Paul Vulfiuss (1924‚Äì1998) had come to Australia in 1949 and married a 4th generation Western Australian Beth Lorraine Bartram (1931‚Äì2005) from Dumbleyung.  Life in Western Australia In Western Australia in late 1953 Wulffius met Madame Kira Bousloff of the Western Australian Ballet and they became close friends. Madame Kira speaks of her lovingly in an interview with Michelle Potter in 1990. Wulffius founded her own Ballet School in Maddington Western Australia. She ran this school for seven years before handing it over to her close friend Madame Gundi Ferris. She also taught Russian at the University of Western Australia. She was an expert on the History of Dance. She continued until she was 80 to teach Perth's Ballet students the History of Dance and her own unique Ballet head, hand and arm movements (which she said were a cross between the Russian and Italian schools). Wulffius told her family and friends that a certain Estonian dancer had stolen her manuscript on hand movements and gestures and published it under her own name in Estonia. Joan Woods reports that the hand movements were based on those of Ella Ilbak a famous Estonia solo-dancer and writer who studied in St Petersburg at the same time as Wulffius.Kira's Legacy: the History of the First Twenty-One years of the West Australian ballet Company by Joan Woods p.25 Joan Woods writing on the history of the West Australian Ballet says that Wulffius was one of Kira Bousloff's first helpers and was Ballet mistress of the company for 12 months. Joan Woods also writes: Around 1979 she moved to live with her granddaughter Mrs Tamara Bartram (n√©e Vulfiuss) at \\"Hillside\\" farm in Dumbleyung. She taught German to the students at the local school. Wulffius was fluent in six languages. She died on 6 February 1992 at Dumbleyung and is buried at the Nippering Cemetery near Dumbleyung.

Life He was the elder brother of Philip Cazenove, who in 1823 founded Cazenove the firm of stockbrokers. Cazenove was educated at Charterhouse School. He is thought by Patricia James to have met Robert Malthus through Charles Webb Le Bas.James, p. 355. After Malthus died in 1834, Cazenove applied for the teaching vacancy at the East India College. The position went to Richard Jones.James, pp. 355‚Äì6. Works Cazenove has been considered one of the \\"Cambridge Inductivist\\" group of intellectuals.

James comments that it is now impossible to know whether the views in that edition are those of Malthus or the editor.James, p. 274. In 1853, Cazenove revised Malthus's Definitions in Political Economy, which had first been published in 1827.Critical edition; compares Malthus's original work with Cazenove's edition. The list of publications by Cazenove is still not clarified by scholars. He was a reviewer for the British Critic, and at this period the custom was that reviews were unsigned. There is some debate about a series of reviews in the British Critic, ten from the years 1815 to 1824, that related to economic topics and apparently voiced views close to Malthus. One such review, Malthus on Political Economy, took the opportunity to enter the Malthus‚ÄìRicardo debate, attacking the inverse wage-profit relationship of David Ricardo.James, pp. 291‚Äì2 and p. 487 note 45. Some or all of these have been attributed to Cazenove. But the external evidence to show his authorship is absent. He is known to have reviewed works of John Ramsay McCulloch (1824) and Thomas Chalmers (1832). Of other publications, Cazenove wrote 11, of which seven were published anonymously. In 1859 Cazenove edited the Literary Remains of Richard Jones. They were published with a preface by William Whewell.James, p. 460.

It is located along the A849 road aligned along the coast line of Ross, on Loch Scridain in southwestern Mull, along the road to Bunessan. The Leidle River passes to the west of the village into the Loch. Geography The village is approached from the west over a small bridge across the Leidle River, known as Pennyghael Bridge. The A849 rubble bridge contains a single arch and dates to 1835-6. The Pennyghael Estate covers roughly and extends to the sea cliffs at Carsaig Bay and from Kinloch in the east to Aird Fada in the west. Pennyghael has a weather observation station which is equipped with Simple Auroral Magnetometer, thermometer and hygrometer which are enclosed in a small Stevenson Screen and fixed on the wall of the observatory building here. History There is an inference that the name of the country could have derived from the usage ‚ÄúThe Pennyland of the Gael\\", when land was valued in terms of penny or fraction of a penny. Ancient history of Pennyghael is traced to Neolithic cairns found at Burg, which links the county to 4000BC when people lived here. When the Iron Age started, farmers worked around the shores of Loch Scridain in around 600 BC. In the first century AD, the Norwegians and Danes invaded the county, evidence for which is still noted from some of the names inherited from them. The presence of Clan McGilvray during the fourth century AD is inferred as the period in 327 AD when King Colla da Crioch and 350 Scots clan chiefs from Ireland had migrated to the Western Isles. By the start of the 1390s, the MacLean of Duarts had control over the place. The first Laird of Pennyghael, as officially recorded in 1542, was Archibald McGillivray (1510-1565). In 1608, Pennyghael was chartered by Duart to Neil McGillivray. The MacGillivrays were the dominant family in the village for centuries. Donald MacGillivray was laird of Pennyghael in 1618. Rev. Martin MacGillivray was of the area in 1631-50. By 1701, one John MacGillivray is mentioned, and in 1751, there was n Alexander MacGillivray associated with Pennyghael. They lived in a house here which was located to the south of the island Mul and which formed the western entrance to Loch Ness. In 1701, the local reverend was the Reverend Martin MacGillivray; his nephew, John MacGillivray was laird at the time. Alexander MacGillivray was laird of Pennyghael in 1751. Descendants of the clan may exist but the family line of the Pennyghael family is much less clear than that of the Dunmaglass family. Pennyghael Development Association (PDA) was established in 2000 as a charitable institution, and in 2005 its objective was to acquire the building of Old School in Pennyghael and restart it for which funds were raised from the community. The PDA also had plans to develop a community centre. Notable landmarks Pennyghael Pennyghael Community Hall is a tall-roofed building. Pennycross School, of square pink granite, dates to 1872. There is a stone cross monument located about north of Pennyghael House. Known as the Crois an Ollaimh, it is rough-cut and of Latin type. The white building, Smithy House (also The Old Smithy), is used as a guest house. The early 19th century Kinloch Hotel, a three bay gabled inn, lies to the northeast. Also nearby is the Pennyghael Hotel, to the south of the Island Mul, noted as a \\"delightful, six-room country hotel set in a 17th-century farmhouse near the head of Loch Scridain, about halfway between Craignure and Fionnphort;\\" all rooms have views of Loch Scridain or Ben More, and two rooms provide views of white tailed eagle nest also. The restaurant in the hotel serves dishes of crab, mussels, pork and Tobermory cheeses. The now abandoned Pennyghael Lodge was built in the 18th century, extended 1816-19, and expanded in the 1920s, while the circa early 19th century Rossal Farm is a two-storey building which had restoration work in the 1980s. The nearby Carsaig Estate and surrounding area was the location for the film The Silent Storm. Fauna The estate is noted for its two families of otters (on the northern shore) and a seal colony on the reef of Killunaig. Also seen here are red deer (in the moors), peregrine falcons, sea and golden eagles, ravens, hen harriers, wild goats, and others. Avifauna species recorded in Pennyghael and in the surrounding region are: meadow pipits, and rock pipits, wheatears; seabirds such great black-backed gull, lesser black-backed gull, common gulls, gannets, shearwaters; raptors, buzzards, and golden eagles on the Carsaig hills; the Loch has eider, black guillemot, guillemot, black-throated divers, red-throated divers, great- northern divers and also otters; redstart, chaffinch, greenfinch, blackbirds and many species of woodland birds; shore birds oystercatcher, curlew and many species of gull near Burg and Tiroran; swallows near often barns and outbuildings; common sandpiper, eider ducks, lapwing, and whitethroat around the Loch; species seen in the Loch Beg are oystercatcher, curlew, and many water birds, redshank and ringed plover; and in the forested areas eared owls are also recorded.

After Southampton achieved city status in 1964 it was renamed Southampton City Transport. In 1986, as a result of deregulation it became Southampton Citybus, an arms-length company that was sold to the staff in 1993. It continued trading as Southampton Citybus until it was bought by First Bus in 1997. Beginning Thornycroft J bus in the Milestones Museum, Basingstoke Bus transport started in Southampton shortly after World War I in 1919 with the first route starting on 31 July of that year, carrying the legend \\"Southampton Corporation Tramways\\". The route ran from the Clock Tower to Winchester Road (St. James Corner). It went via Bedford Place and St. James Road. Over the years, the Corporation extended the network, with routes going to many places over the City, including the Floating Bridge, Royal Pier, and Millbrook Road. In the earlier days buses were stored at Highfield Depot, and the buses used were Thornycroft \\"J\\" type fitted with double-deck, open top bodies built at the Portswood works. Travelling by bus was becoming more popular and in response to this, in 1920 several routes in the eastern side of the city were trialled, including a short route from Bitterne Church to Sholing. The Bitterne Church to Sholing route however was withdrawn in January 1921, but was reinstated in September 1922. Another route that was not attracting as many passengers as hoped was from the Floating Bridge to Tanners Brook, which was withdrawn in March 1921. The Corporation was making a loss on these bus services so a major change was needed and in 1921, new buses were bought; these being Leyland chassis \\"E\\" Type which the Corporation fitted with a single deck body with a front entrance, thereby distinguishing it from the open top buses that were previously used. The single deck buses proved their worth on the Clock Tower to Winchester Road route. In 1925, more new buses were ordered and the name was changed from 'Southampton Corporation Tramways' to the 'Southampton Corporation Motor Service', and also a new livery was added to the fleet, consisting of blue upper and lower panels, divided by a white waist rail. Problems were being found with the Bitterne route by 1925, having been extended to Woolston; the problem being that the roads were falling into serious disrepair. 1926 saw the introduction of several new routes, which were an alternative from Woolston to Sholing, meeting the demand for bus travel on the eastern side of the City; another route being from Grand Theatre to Burgess Road via Hill Lane. Over the years, new buses were being delivered of various models; Guy, Leyland, Thornycroft and AEC. More routes were also being added with routes now going to Butts Road, Swaythling and Freemantle, thus expanding the existing network. A new bus garage was opened on 1 January 1932 on St. Denys' Road ‚Äì Portswood Depot, which offered the Corporation a much- needed increase in storage capacity and overhaul facilities. World War II The first buses that were used on bus services in Southampton were petrol but in the 1930s the diesel engine was developed and was proving its worth. During 1934 and 1935 considerable extensions and more new routes were added to the network. There was also further trials of different sorts of buses. In 1937, the Conservative government gave approval for The Southampton Corporation Act, which gave the Corporation the powers to abandon the Tramways, although it wouldn't be until December 1949 when the trams would finally close. In 1939 with the start of World War II a number of regulations were introduced by the Home Office, including total blackouts from sunset to sunrise. This meant that buses had to run without lights, though an emergency lighting system was included. Some restrictions had been eased by March 1940, which meant certain minor extensions and modifications could be carried out, and school bus services were introduced. However tranquillity would not last long as the last three months in 1940 saw the Southampton area suffer very badly in the Blitz, but fortunately only one bus, No. 43, and one tram, No. 31, was destroyed by enemy action. As many men went to war there was a shortage of staff to operate the services. As a result, women were employed to be conductresses and as their number gradually increased, women were then trained on trams and buses as drivers. Another problem with the war was that there was a shortage of fuel and rubber for tyres. At the end of the war the Transport Department's most immediate problem was the mechanical and structural condition of its fleet of trams and buses after 6 years of conflict. The blue livery, proving unsuitable as it soon began to fade, was replaced with a new livery of red and cream. Large numbers of Guy Arab IIs were ordered to replace pre-war buses, which were due for withdrawal and as tram replacements. The new buses also meant that new routes could be operated and increasing frequencies of existing services could be achieved. Before the war, the Transport Department had planned for trolley-buses to replace the trams but it was felt that they would be route-bound just like the trams.  After the War After the trams finished in December 1949, the Shirley Tram Depot was converted into a bus garage and was first used on 16 July 1950, therefore reducing the number of empty trips from Shirley to Portswood, saving time and resources. In 1951 with housing developments rapidly being built in Millbrook and Harefield, new bus services were needed. Two years after the abandonment of the tram network the Transport Department found itself cutting services because of financial problems. The chief problem was that too much \\"dead\\" mileage was being run and some services were not carrying sufficient passengers. The summer of 1952 saw the long-awaited high capacity Standee buses being delivered. The Standees were used on services 5A, 8 and 16, and these routes‚Äôserviced the Woolston and Bitterne areas of the city. With the Shirley Depot becoming fully capable of dealing with most routine maintenance and some body work, Portswood nevertheless remained the most important depot of the two as it had a body shop, paint shop and also had equipment for all major mechanical repairs. Buses that were based at Shirley carried \\"S\\" on the nearside upper deck front panel. Guy Arab III open top bus in the 1979 Centenary Cavalcade Service changes were carried out throughout the 1950s to respond to increasing demand. One of the first joint services to operate with joint Hants & Dorset Motor Services was the 54 to West End, which came about in 1953 with the expansion of housing estates. For example, Townhill Park while most was in the 'town' boundary, some it was in Hampshire and so came under the territorial Tilling operator. The summer of 1955 saw an interesting development, which was that two post-war buses were converted to open-top and repainted in a cream and red-lining livery. These were used on a Town Tour, which started on Sunday 8 May 1955. In July 1957 another two services were jointly operated by both the Corporation and Hants & Dorset; the first being from the Town Centre to Millbrook, which was the first to be introduced, and the second being an express coach service from Civic Centre to Southampton Airport, but this was subsequently withdrawn after 6 months due to poor passenger numbers. New large estates were being built across the City and all of them required public transport. A number of services could be diverted or extended to service the new estates. The only estate that needed a new service to be introduced was Thornhill. This requirement saw the birth of the 18 service, which was introduced on 15 December 1957, and ran from Central Station to Thornhill via the Civic Centre and Bitterne. 335 Leyland Titan PD2/27 (335 AOW) in Bitterne in 1984 A scheme proposed in 1955 for developing Pound Tree Road in the City Centre as a bus centre. The plans included new shelters and bus stands but it wasn't until the spring of 1959 that services started using the Centre. Since the war the Transport Department Office had been housed in temporary accommodation due to the Above Bar offices being destroyed during the Blitz. Plans for a new headquarters were on the cards for many years but it was not until 12 December 1960 that new headquarters were opened at 224 ‚Äì 226 Portswood Road, containing facilities for the management of the Transport Department as well as a canteen. In the earlier 1960s a major programme of fleet replacements was undertaken with the Department testing a number of buses to replace the Guy Arabs that were dating back to 1946. The bus chose to replace the Guy Arabs were Leyland PD2/27s. The first batch to arrive in Southampton was numbered 301‚Äì312 and were 27 feet long and 8 feet wide. In 1963 more Guy Arabs were withdrawn as more new buses were arriving this time in the form of AEC Regent Vs. 1960 ‚Äì 1979 SCT AEC Regent V with East Lancs body An important event in Southampton happened in 1964 with the elevation of Southampton to City status, therefore changing the previous 'Southampton Corporation Transport' title to 'Southampton City Transport', with the formal date of change being 11 February 1964. The two original open top buses were now due for retirement and were replaced with two converted Guy Arab vehicles from the 1949 batch. Also the Transport Committee decided that all new buses would be A.E.C. chassis fitted with East Lancashire bodies. In 1966, bigger buses that could provide higher passenger capacities were needed and a prototype entered service in early 1966; this being a 30 feet long double-deck bus. The prototype proved to be a success and so was followed by a further seven buses and another 20 in 1967. These would be the last rear entrance double deckers to be bought by Southampton. Later in 1967 another prototype was introduced; this being an A.E.C. Swift, which was a high capacity single decker and was trailed on Woolston routes as a replacement to the Standees, which were due for retirement. The chassis were made by A.E.C. and were 36 feet long. It also had a local body, a Pacemaster built by Strachans of Hamble. Five similar buses were delivered in 1968. All of these buses were one-man operation. 173 Leyland Atlantean (PCR 269M) at Bitterne in 1989 Leyland Atlantean were chosen to be brought into the fleet as they could convert the fleet into single-man operation. The first delivery of Atlanteans that took place in the Autumn of 1968 being for staff familiarisation. From 1968 till the end of 1975 more than a hundred were delivered. The first route to be converted to one-man operation was the 18 and 18A from Central Station to Thornhill, and two further routes were converted on 12 January 1969. As more and more Atlanteans joined the fleet there started to be problems at Portswood Depot. So in 1972 work started on stage one of Portswood's redevelopment. This contained a new garage, which included maintenance pits, workshops, and a service block. The new Portswood depot was finished in 1973. In March 1974, work started on the Itchen Bridge and was completed in 1977 and soon after it opened most services were changed to incorporate the new bridge. The Woolston bus station also closed soon after the opening of the bridge. 1979 marked the centenary of Southampton transport and was celebrated by a Grand Cavalcade of buses on Sunday 6 May. The cavalcade started at West Quay and toured round the suburbs ending up on the common. The day culminating in a fireworks display in the evening. The following day judging of entries in the various classes took place. Ninety-three buses took part, both service buses and preserved vehicles, drawn from all over the country. The number included three buses from France, one from Caen and two from Le Havre. CityBus In 1986, as a result of deregulation an 'arms-length' limited company was formed in the name of Southampton Citybus and the coat of arms of the City of Southampton was removed, and replaced with the new branding. Southampton Citybus operated a fleet of around 150 vehicles, and a small coaching division named Red Ensign. Following the Transport Act 1985 and the deregulation of the bus market, it faced aggressive competition from the Isle of Wight-based bus company Southern Vectis, which started Solent Blue Line in 1987 as a bid to expand onto the mainland, competing on some of the same major routes as Citybus. 302 Dennis Dart 9SDL Carlyle prototype ‚ÄúEcobus‚Äù (G302 XCR), Bitterne 1995 Southampton City Council owned Southampton Citybus until 21 December 1993 when it was then bought by its employees for around ¬£3 million. Following this Southampton Citybus introduced sixteen natural gas-powered buses into regular service, which at the time was the largest such fleet in the UK. Over the years much of the fleet of 160 buses was replaced. Southampton Citybus was owned by its employees until 1997 when it was purchased by FirstGroup. At first for a brief period they kept the name but soon changed it to First Southampton. Today it is now a part of First Hampshire & Dorset. Preservation A number of ex-Southampton Corporation Transport buses still survive to the present day. Most are associated with the Southampton & District Transport Heritage Trust who look after Guys 'Arabs' and Standee, A.E.C. Regent and Swift, Seddon RU and Leyland Atlantean and National. The Southampton & District Transport Heritage Trust (S&DTHT;) was formed in the summer of 2000 and drew members from groups including the now defunct Southampton City Transport enthusiasts 7164 Group and the Solent Transport Trust.

The Sanskrit text is one of the 20 Yoga Upanishads, and is one of 32 Upanishads attached to the Krishna Yajurveda. In the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed at number 86 in the anthology of 108 Upanishads. It is a highly significant text related to the exposition of the Kundalini Yoga, describes Hatha and Lambika yoga, and the last chapter is primarily about the quest of self-knowledge, Atman, Brahman (the Non-dual Brahman) and living liberation. It is an important text in Tantra, to the Shakti tradition of Hinduism, and considered one of the most important texts on Kundalini Yoga.Vana Mali (2008), Shakti: Realm of the Divine Mother, , pages 311‚Äì314, Quote: \\"The Yoga-kundalini Upanishad is the eighty-sixth among the one hundred and eight important Upanishads. It is a most important work on kundalini yoga.\\"Mary Scott (2007), The Kundalini Concept: Its Origin and Value, Jain Publishing, , pages 1‚Äì14 According to the Yoga-Kundalini Upanishad, \\"even as fire in logs of wood will not rise without churning, so also without the practice of Yoga, the light of knowledge cannot be lit\\". Chitta, or mind, is explained in the text as a source for Samskaras and Vasanas (behavioural tendencies), as well as an effect of Prana. Yoga techniques to become aware of and to control Prana are elaborated in the Upanishad. These techniques include Mitahara (moderate, balanced nutrition), Asana (posture exercises), and shakti-chalana (awakening inner force) are asserted to be the means to arousing a yogin's Kundalini.  Etymology  Yoga (from the root ') means \\"to add\\", \\"to join\\", \\"to unite\\", or \\"to attach\\" in its most common literal sense. According to Dasgupta, the term yoga can be derived from either of two roots, yujir yoga (to yoke) or yuj samƒÅdhau (to concentrate). Kundalini, states James Lochtefeld, refers to \\"the latent spiritual power that exists in every person\\".James G Lochtefeld (2001), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, Rosen Publishing, , pages 381‚Äì382 It is a fundamental concept in tantra, and symbolizes an aspect of Shakti that is typically dormant in every person, and its awakening is a goal in tantra. The root of the word is kundala (coiled rope). The title \\"Yoga-kundalini Upanishad\\" literally means \\"the secret doctrine of Kundalini yoga\\".  Chronology  The Yoga-Kundalini Upanishad is a common era text, composed sometime after Yogasutras.Charles Leadbeater (1927), The Chakras, Theosophical Society, page xii Banerjea states that the Yoga-Kundalini text, like many late Yoga Upanishads, deals with yogic concepts and methods taught by Siddha Yogi teachers such as Gorakhnath, an 11th-century yogi.Ak Banejea (2014), Philosophy of Gorakhnath with Goraksha-Vacana-Sangraha, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 26  Structure  The text is set in verse, structured into three chapters, with a total of 171 verses. The first chapter has 87 verses, and discusses yoga practice. The second chapter with 49 verses discusses Khecari (Sanskrit: ‡§ñ‡•á‡§ö‡§∞‡§ø) knowledge. The last chapter consists of 35 verses and discusses soul, Brahman, meditation and living liberation. The contents of Yoga-Kundalini Upanishad were influenced by Hatha yoga and Mantra yoga, with the first two chapters structured in verses of Kundalini tantra, the third chapter structured in a chant genre (Mantra yoga).  Contents  = Chapter 1: The practice = The first chapter opens with the statement that human mind is influenced by memories and Prana (vital breath, inner life-force). First and foremost, states the text, a yogin should begin by mastering Prana. The verse 1,2 of the Upanishad assert that this can be achieved by Mitahara, Asana and \\"rousing of inner power (Kundalini)\\" (Shakti-chalan).‡•• ‡§Ø‡•ã‡§ó‡§ï‡•Å‡§£‡•ç‡§°‡§≤‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Å‡§™‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡§§‡•ç ‡•• Sanskrit text of Yogakundalini Upanishad, SanskritDocuments Archives (2009) Mitahara (Sanskrit: ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡§æ‡§π‡§æ‡§∞, MitƒÅhƒÅra) means moderation in food (light, sweet and nutritious food), and in the Yoga tradition, it is the concept of integrated awareness about food, drink, balanced diet and consumption habits and its effect on one‚Äôs body and mind. It is one of the ten Yamas in ancient Indian texts.KN Aiyar (1914), Thirty Minor Upanishads, Kessinger Publishing, , Chapter 22, pages 173‚Äì176 Mitahara is neither eating too much nor eating too little quantity of food, and self-restraint from either eating too much or too little of certain qualities of food.Steven Rosen (2011), Food for the Soul: Vegetarianism and Yoga Traditions, Praeger, , pages 25‚Äì29Mitihara, in What is Hinduism? (Ed: Hinduism Today Magazine, 2007), Himalayan Academy, Hawaii, , page 340 Verse 1.3 and 1.4 of the Yoga-kundalini Upanishad state that one must eat nourishing and sapient food. The Upanishad in verses 1.4 to 1.6 describes Asanas (postures) as a part of practice for the yogi and yogini. Asana () means \\"to sit down\\".Monier-Williams, Sir Monier (1899). A Sanskrit-English Dictionary. Oxford Clarendon Press, p. 159 The text lists just two asanas in these verses ‚Äì Padmasana (lotus posture) and Vajrasana (diamond or kneeling posture). Verses 1.7 to 1.18 of the text summarize the practice of Kundalini- arousing. The two steps include Arousing the Saraswati Nadi, and breath control (Pranayama and Kumbhaka).; the Kumbhakas cause total restraint of the Prana. The text in verses 1.18‚Äì1.39 details the breath control practice in several ways including Surya-Kumbhaka, Ujjayi-Kumbhaka, Sitali-Kumbhaka and Bhastra-Kumbhaka. Three types of Bandha are summarized in verses 1.40 to 1.53 ‚Äì Mula Bandha, Uddiyana bandha and Jalamdhara Bandha. The text states that the Kumbhaka and Bandha practice arouses various Nadi (blood vessels through which subtle and causal energies flow). ;Obstacles The Yogakundali Upanishad, in verses 1.54 to 1.66 recommends the progress steps and number of times yoga should be attempted, and obstacles to one's progress. In verses 1.56‚Äì1.61, it states that those who are ill or injured should not do this yoga, and those who are suffering from excretory obstructions should refrain as well. The text lists as obstacles to progress in a yogin as following: self doubts, confusion, indifference, abnormal sleep, habit of giving up, delusions, being caught up in worldly drama, failure to comprehend descriptions, suspicions regarding the truth of yoga. ;Chakras The Yoga-kundalini Upanishad mentions six chakras. The verses 1.65 to 1.76 describe the process of progress and experience, with the text stating that the Chakra with sixteen petals called Anahata is awakened, linking vital fluids of the human body symbolically to moon and sun, that is arousing the awareness of cold and hot essence within respectively. The text lists six chakras as the Ajna is in the head (between the two eyebrows), Vishuddhi (root of the neck), Anahata (heart), Manipuraka (navel), Svadhishthana (near genital organ) and Muladhara (base of spinal cord). These, states the text, are centers of Shakti (power, energy, subtle force).KN Aiyar (1914), Thirty Minor Upanishads, University of Toronto Archives, , page 260-272John George Woodroffe (1974, pen name: Arthur Avalon), The Serpent Power, Courier, , page 115 ;Goal The Yogakundali Upanishad, in verses 1.77 to 1.87, outlines the destination for the journey of Kundali-yoga practice to be the knowledge of Brahman (eternal, changeless reality), Atman (soul, self), and inner liberation. In verses 1.77 to 1.81, it cautions the yogin against having \\"absurd and impossible notions\\" such as rope serpent, delusions such as men and women expecting \\"silver in the shell of the pearl oyster\\" through yoga. The text states that the goal is for the yogin as: Inner self-awareness, from the body in lotus Asana, in a mind absorbed in the Kumbhaka, state the last verses of the first chapter, breaks through inner knots of Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra, then through six lotuses, unleashing the Kundalini Shakti in the thousand petalled lotus, delighting in the company of Shiva. It is then, asserts the text, that the yogin pierces through the phenomenal world of differences and reaches oneness, the cause of the manifestation of bliss. = Chapter 2: The Khecari Vidya = The Chapter 2 opens with a praise and wonders of Khechari knowledge, with the assertion that \\"one who has mastered this, is devoid of aging and mortality\\" and free from the suffering from diseases. The word Khechari means \\"transversing the ethereal regions\\", and the text dedicates first 16 verses of the chapter stating how difficult it is, how wonderful and miraculous it is, how even experts fail in it, how secret this knowledge is, how even a hundred rebirths are insufficient for mastering Khechari-Vidya. But those who do, attain the state of Shiva, claims the text, and they are liberated from all attachments to the world.KN Aiyar (1914), Thirty Minor Upanishads, University of Toronto Archives, , page 266-269 The verses 2.17 to 2.20 use a cryptic code to explain how to extract Khechari-Vidya bija (seed). These are then constituted into a Khechari-mantra in verse 2.20, as \\"Hrƒ´·πÉ, Bham, Sa·πÉ,Sha·πÉ, Pha·πÉ, Sa·πÉ and Ksha·πÉ\\".KN Aiyar (1914), Thirty Minor Upanishads, University of Toronto Archives, , page 270 The text, in verses 2.21‚Äì2.27 returns to praising the mantra, and then describes that the muttering the mantra and a variety of austere khechari-yoga practices over twelve years in verses 2.28 to 2.49. Success would be achieved, states the text in the closing verses of chapter 2, when the yogin sees in his body, the entire universe. = Chapter 3: The Jivanmukta = The third chapter of the Upanishad discusses the state of Samadhi and that is Jivanmukta (living liberation). It defines Samadhi as that state of Atman and pure consciousness in which \\"all is known as one\\" and the existence in the nectar of oneness.John George Woodroffe (1974, pen name: Arthur Avalon), The Serpent Power, Courier, , page 194 The verses 3.1 to 3.11 assert, translates Ayyangar, that this state is \\"assuming the attitude of I am the Brahman and giving up that also\\", eliminating all bondages of the mind, and awakening the Ishvara (god) within, through one's energized Kundalini and the six Chakras. This state is one of entering bliss, asserts the Upanishad. According to verses 3.14 to 3.16, Yoga is essential for the light of knowledge to be lit, and the Atman (soul) is the lamp inside one's body. The precepts and guidance of a Guru (teacher) is essential for mastering Kundalini yoga and to cross the ocean of worldly existence, state verses 3.17 to 3.18.Yogakundali Upanishad Sunder Hattangadi, Sanskritdocuments.org Archive (2015) Right knowledge leads to an existence of a tranquil and sublime state, where there is neither darkness nor radiance, it is indescribable asserts the Yogakundali Upanishad. A Yogin, deluded by Maya and exhausted, states the text in verses 3.25 to 3.32, questions \\"Who am I? How has the worldly existence been brought about? Where do I go when I sleep? Who functions when I am awake? Who functions when I dream in sleep?\\"KN Aiyar (1914), Thirty Minor Upanishads, University of Toronto Archives, , page 271-272 This is a knowledge lost over one's rebirths. Meditation and Kundalini yoga helps one to realize the answers within, lit a light that shines within, reach the saintly state of Jivanmukta, who remains in eternal Brahman alone, states the Upanishad.

It was set up in 2004.http://desw.gov.in/about_us Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare The head of Department of Ex-servicemen Welfare since its inception has been a bureaucrat from the IAS. Veteran have for long demanded that DEWS be headed by a serving officers or a retired officer, like in other countries, including the United States, in which the Department of Veterans, is invariably headed by veteran with active duty military experience, with a cabinet rank. For instance the current head of the department is graduate of West Point, and has served in the army.  Functions and Organization The functions of DESW according to the official website are: \\"Matters relating to Armed Forces Veterans (Ex- Servicemen) including pensioners;Armed Forces Veterans (ExServicemen); Contributory Health Scheme; Matters relating to Directorate General of Resettlement and Kendriya Sainik Board; Administration of (a) the Pension Regulations for the Army, 1961 (Parts I and II); (b)the Pension Regulations for the Air Force, 1961 (Parts I and II);(c)the Navy (Pension) Regulations, 1964; and(d) The Entitlement Rules to Casualty Pensionary Awards to the Armed Forces Personnel, 1982\\". The Department has two Divisions, the Resettlement Division and the Pension Division and 3 attached offices namely (a) Secretariat of Kendriya Sainik Board (KSB), (b) Directorate General (Resettlement) (DGR) and (c) Ex-servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) Organisation.  Veterans in India  There are about 2.6 million ex- servicemen, and 60,000 widows, including war widows, i.e., a combined total of 3.2 million, of whom about 86 percent are widows, Junior Commissioned Officers, Non Commissioned Officers , and other ranks, and about 14 percent are officers. Approximately 60,000 armed forces personnel retire or are released from active service every year. Most are in age bracket of 35 to 45 years. Directorate General Resettlement (DGR) is responsible for preparing retiring/ retired service personnel for a second career. Veterans in India in the last decade have resorted to public protest under the OROP banner to highlight that they are uncared for and treated far worse than civilian counterparts. DEWS and Veterans = DEWS Response to Veteran Issues= The Ministry of Defence (MOD), including the DEWS, which is a component of the ministry, is considered by most ex-servicemen, including former head of the Armed Forces, as permanent impediment for the welfare of Ex Serviceman (ESM). Four former heads of the Armed Forces in August 2015, in an open letter addressed to the President of India flagged \\"The hostile approach of MoD bureaucracy\\" and its \\"antagonistic handling of problems related to pensions and allowances of aging veterans, war widows and battle-casualties'. = DEWS opposes One Rank One Pension (OROP) = The Department of Ex-servicemen Welfare has opposed One Rank One Pension OROP. In 2011, Neelam Nath, Secretary of Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare from June 1, 2009 to September 30, 2011, in her deposition in front of the Parliamentary Panel that examined the grant of OROP to the Armed Forces, opposed the grant and implementation of OROP for the Armed Forces. On February 17, 2014, despite protest of DESW, the Government announced in the interim budget acceptance of the principle of ‚ÄòOne Rank One Pension (OROP), and Ministry of Defence Report 2013-14, noted that \\"Government has taken steps to implement the OROP from the financial year 2014-15\\" and that the implementation will improve pensions of past pensioners . Despite the announcement in the MOD Report, OROP was not implemented. The failure to implement OROP by the BJP Government which had in its election manifesto pledged to do so provoked nationwide protest by ex servicemen. Failure of the BJP Government to implement OROP after several promises provoked Ex-servicemen to undertake unprecedented nationwide protests, and hunger strikes from 15 June 2015. Veteran protest have had the support of former heads of armed Forces. Four former chiefs of the Armed Forces of India, namely General S F Rodrigues, former COAS, and Admirals L Ramdas, Arun Prakash and Sureesh Mehta, former Chiefs of Naval Staff, in an open letter to President Pranab Mukherjee, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, on 13 August 2015, warned that the denigration and humiliation of veterans, and the Government handling of veterans and armed Forces issues, pose grave \\"implication for national security\\" National Commission for Ex-Servicemen Following persistent demand by Ex servicemen, the Government on 9 June 2014 announces that it will set up a National Commission for Ex-Servicemen.

It was unique in that its cylinders, instead of being open-ended cylinders containing two pistons, were instead joined in a Y-shape and had three pistons working within them. These engines were produced by Hermann Michel of the Michel Engine Company of Kiel, Germany, in the 1920s and 1930s. A US patent application was filed in 1921 and granted in 1926. This Michel engine should not be confused with the contemporary Michell engine, which was a swashplate engine.  Operation  The Michel engine was a two-stroke diesel engine, of piston- ported opposed-piston design. Its unusual feature was that rather than two pistons sharing a cylinder, the cylinders here were Y shaped and contained three pistons. The two upper pistons controlled the inlet ports, with the one lower piston controlling the exhaust ports. Having two inlet (scavenge air) pistons to one exhaust piston provided good scavenging and efficient combustion. The engine was water-cooled.  Variants  Cam engine, longitudinal section from above Early versions of the Michel engine were cam engines. These do not use a crankshaft in the conventional sense, but instead have a shaped cam. The pistons or their connecting rods have cam followers that slide over the surface of this cam. Although most cams use rotary motion to generate a linear motion, this 'crankshaft' use is also possible, where the linear motion of the pistons is used to drive the rotary motion of the cam and the engine's output shaft. Cam engines have all been unsuccessful so far, although the idea enjoyed some popularity in the mid-20th century, amongst inventors if not engineers. A similar idea was the swashplate engine, an axial form of cam engine. Although the forces in a cam engine are often greater and the frictional losses are high, they can also allow the use of larger bearing surfaces than a conventional crankshaft. Before the development of high performance bearing materials,Approximately the 1930s for aircraft engines, the 1950s for lower-budget applications. the cam and swashplate engines appeared to offer some advantages. Cam engines are two-stroke, rather than four-stroke. In a two-stroke engine, the forces on the piston act uniformly downwards, throughout the cycle. In a four-stroke engine, these forces reverse cyclically: in the induction phase, the piston is forced upwards, against the reduced induction depression. The simple cam mechanism only works with a force in one direction. In the first Michel engines, the cam had two surfaces, a main surface on which the pistons worked when running and another ring inside this that gave a desmodromic action to constrain the piston position during engine startup. = Rotary engine = The first version of this engine, as described in the initial patent, was a rotary engine: the 'crank' (in this case the cam ring) remained fixed and the cylinders revolved around it. This type of engine (although as spark-ignition petrol engines, not diesels) had developed before World War I as an aircraft engine, its advantage being improved cooling for the cylinders as they rotated through a stream of cooling air. A disadvantage of the rotary engine was the increased rotating mass, although in the Michel case, the cam track was itself of considerable mass and so the significance was less than it had been for the aircraft engine. The rotary version of the engine had the fuel injection pump mounted on the rotating portion of the engine, along with the cylinders. Fuel, lubricating oil and cooling water were supplied through rotating couplings. Little is known of the rotary engine version. It is described in two early German sources, but although mentioned in the 1928 NACA report, it appears to have been superseded by then. = Cam engine = A second version of the engine retained the cam drive from the pistons, but now had the cylinder block fixed in place with the cam ring rotating in the function of a crankshaft. This is illustrated in the NACA report, but not described in the text. The original roller followers for each piston were later replaced by plain bearings. The engine was targeted at output powers between 120 bhp to 1,000 bhp. The cylinder diameter for these engines was 180mm. As for many radial engines, cylinder rows'Rows' in radial engine are the circular planes of cylinders counted axially, along the crankshaft. could be stacked for greater power. In most aircraft radial engines this is restricted to only one or two rows, by the need for air cooling of the rear rows. The Michel engine, being water- cooled, had no such restriction.A similar group of engines were the inline radial engines. A further advantage of the multiple rows was improved dynamic balance. An advantage of the cam engine over the crankshaft is that it is a simple task to provide the cam with multiple lobes per revolution, giving more piston strokes for the same output shaft speed. The multiple lobes, either four or six of them, have the same overall effect as an output shaft reduction gearbox would. This was particularly useful for marine engines, driving a more efficient low-speed propeller. For two engines with the same shaft speed, this may also be considered as having the pistons running six times as fast: effectively a bigger and more powerful engine, yet weighing around the same. A limit on this though would have been the metallurgical limits of piston linear velocity. At this time, the maximum speed that a piston and its rings could travel within a cylinder was limited by state of design and lubrication techniques to maintain a good seal and avoid seizure. This was especially difficult for two-stroke diesel engines, as the constant downward force on the piston ring, rather than the cyclical variation of the four-stroke engine, tended to cause it to stick in its groove. Despite this, the engine had a poor power to weight ratio, even for these early days of medium-speed diesel engines. A 1,000 bhp Michel marine engine, intended for submarines,Owing to the flammability hazards of petrol vapour in the confined space of a submarine, there was much interest at this time, particularly in Germany, in developing compact diesel engines for use in submarines. was quoted as weighing 42,000 kg, compared to 128,000 kg for a comparable four-stroke diesel engine of similar speed and power. However this was also set against other developments in diesel engines. The older low-speed diesel engines (100‚Äì150 rpm, suitable for direct connection to a propeller shaft) were being replaced by medium-speed engines of around 400 rpm and then by 1930 (at least in smaller sizes) high-speed engines of over 1,000 rpm. These had even better specific outputs than the Michel engine. = Multiple crankshafts = In the 1930s, Michel abandoned the cam engine idea and used conventional crankshafts, although requiring three of them, one per cylinder. Other opposed-piston diesel engines were becoming successful at this time, notably the Junkers Jumo 205 engine series, an aircraft engine, also using one crankshaft per piston, rather than one crankshaft per cylinder.The overhead of requiring two crankshafts per cylinder would not be surmounted until the post-war Napier Deltic engine, which shared crankshafts between adjacent cylinder banks, thus having an average of one crankshaft per cylinder. The engine was now much smaller, lighter and had a greater specific power, both by weight and by volume. It was intended for the growing market in diesel lorries. The engine had a single cylinder and three pistons, with bore and stroke of 67 mm √ó 116 mm, giving a swept volume capacity of 1,200 cc. The specific power is given as 40 bhp/litre and 3.5 kg/hp, implying an overall power of around 50 bhp and a weight of 175 kg. The drive between the crankshafts was unusual. Rather than the typical geared drive, as used by the Jumo, there was a triangular coupling rod frame, driven by an overhung crank on the end of each crankshaft. This frame in turn drove the flywheel and output shaft. The frame also drove the fuel injection pump, mounted in the top vee between the cylinders. Being a two-stroke engine, there was also a scavenge blower, operating at 21‚Äì25 psi. This was of unorthodox design: a rectangular pumping chamber formed on the triangular coupling frame. A vertical partition inside this was free to move vertically, but held in place from side-to-side. As the chamber moved with the frame's circular motion, this partition effectively moved from side to side within the chamber, providing a pump action for the scavenge air. The engine was road-tested in light lorries, but nothing seems to have been heard of it after 1937. A claimed advantage was the lack of a cylinder head gasket, which was a reliability problem for early diesels at this time. Possibly it was successful, but simply its unusual nature led to it being ignored during World War II in favour of concentrating on more established designs.

In August 2008, Paladin announced an increase or 64% in Inferred Resources and 46% increase in the Measured and Indicated Resources of the Langer Heinrich mine. In June 2009, Paladin announced the approval of the Stage III Expansion of the mine which was forecast to increase production capacity to 5.2 million lb U3O8 [2000 t U] per year, a reduction on previous forecasts. In October 2009, the company announced a Stage 4 Expansion forecasting production to increase to 10 million lb U3O8 [3,846 t U] per year using heap leaching. In 2010 Paladin Energy announced the sale of uranium to China would start in 2011 after signing an agreement with China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group Co. In 2011, Stage III Expansion was halted due to a miners strike by 600 workers. This was followed by another strike in 2013 by 300 mine workers. In 2013, mines across Namibia faced an uncertain future due to a lack of water needed for mine operations due to a widespread drought in the region. In 2014, the sale of 25% of the mine was concluded with Chinese National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC). In the same year, Paladin Energy announced that Stage 4 Expansion would be halted due to the weakened price of uranium. In 2015, further cost-reduction projects were put in place by Paladin Energy. The Prime Minister of Namibia released a report on the state of the mine addressing safety concerns and working conditions. In July 2016, Paladin announced the sale of a further 24% of the Langer Heinrich mine to CNNC to cover mounting debts, bringing the total ownership by the Chinese owned company to 49%. In May 2018, Paladin confirmed that the mine would cease operations and would be placed into care and maintenance.

The two parts are apart and both are fully owned by Forsys Metals. It represents one of the largest uranium resources in Namibia, having an estimated resource of 48,200 tU in ore grading 0.014-0.0167% uranium. The Valencia deposit was named after the farm where the uranium deposits were found. If built, the mine was expected to produce 18 million tonnes of uranium a year over an 11-year period. The mine is developed by Forsys Metals. History The Valencia deposit was discovered by Trekkopje Exploration in 1972. In 1994, a licence was granted to Tsumeb Corp. a subsidiary of Gold Fields. In 2004, the licence was transferred to Tsumeb Exploration Company, a subsidiary of Ongopolo Mining & Processing. In 2005, Tsumeb was acquired by Forsys Metals. Preliminary environmental assessment for the mine was completed in the beginning of 2006. The pre-feasibility study was completed in May 2007. The environmental impact assessment and the environmental management plan were approved in June 2008. In August 2008, the mining licence was granted. In 2013, the Valencia and the Namibplaas projects were consolidated as Norasa uranium project. At the same year, Forsys Metals laid off most of the workers of the mine due to the low uranium price. In 2014, it commenced the new feasibility study. Sale controversy In 2008, it was announced that the project would be acquired by George Forrest International. The deal was cancelled in 2009. According to the documents published by WikiLeaks, the deal was interfered by the United States and Canadian authorities because of the fear that George Forrest will sell uranium to Iran if it obtained the mine.

Everything in the museum‚Äôs four floors references the novel and the past era in which the book is set. Despite the coupling of museum and novel, Pamuk maintains that the museum and novel can be experienced independent of each other: ‚Äújust as the novel is entirely comprehensible without a visit to the museum, so is the museum a place that can be visited and experienced on its own.‚Äù Pamuk developed the idea for the museum and novel in parallel from the outset; the museum is not 'based on' the novel, and likewise the novel was not written to capture the museum.Official website (English). Retrieved 26 June 2013. This blurring of lines between the two has been explored both in the novel The Museum of Innocence and in the museum catalogue, The Innocence of Objects. In the early 1990s, Pamuk began collecting objects from the past that he saw and liked in junk dealers' shops and friends' homes, gradually forming the narrative that would become The Museum of Innocence. If he saw an object that he thought suited the novel in a junk shop, he bought it and described it in the text. He might stumble upon an object that would inspire a new story in the novel; or he might seek out objects to fit an existing story. =Manifesto for Museums = In ‚ÄúThe Innocence of Objects,‚Äù a catalogue describing the creation of the novel-museum duo, Pamuk lays out a manifesto for museums.

However, as the 10TP and 14TP projects were running behind schedule, in 1938 it was decided to improve on the existing design. The first modification was a new, more powerful powertrain. The new design could use either the Saurer CT1D diesel engine (license-produced in Poland as PZIn≈º 155) or a modern gasoline engine PZIn≈º 725. Both engines were lighter and smaller than the Saurer VBLDd engine used in 7TP. Because of that the armour could be extended and more space could be redirected to the battle compartment. An additional bonus was the fact that both engines were water-cooled which allowed for the rear grille of 7TP to be replaced with solid armoured plates. Another modification planned for the 9TP was switching from bolted and screwed to welded armoured plates, which further strengthened the hull and allowed to save additional 210 kilograms, enough to further strengthen the armour and widen the tracks from 267 mm to 320 mm. Two design teams were tasked to work on the upgrade package. A design team of the PZIn≈º led by Edward Habich decided to use the Saurer CT1D engine and introduce the design improvements gradually at the production lines. In May 1938 the PZIn≈º produced one of the 7TP tanks (hull number 1766) equipped with the new CT1D engine and rear armoured plates. In the autumn of the same year the new tank was tested by the Centre for Armoured Troops Training at Modlin Fortress. Simultaneously a design team of the Technical Research Bureau of Armoured Forces (BBTBP) adopted the PZIn≈º 725 engine and decided to further modify the tank, lowering its silhouette. While the BBTBP design was considered superior to the one proposed by PZIn≈º, eventually the PZIn≈º proposals were accepted as requiring less work and time to introduce in serial production.  Production and service  On 29 June 1939 the Polish Army ordered 100 tanks of the new design to be delivered by June 1940. The following month the PZIn≈º produced two additional prototypes to be extensively tested at tank proving grounds. While tests were generally favourable, it was noted that the new design had much lower speed than had been anticipated (26 km/h on paved roads and 11.5 km/h off-road). It is unclear how many 9TP tanks were actually produced before the outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939. It is assumed that the 11 tanks delivered to the Polish Army already after the start of hostilities were of 9TP rather than 7TP design. If this was the case, than the total number of 9TP tanks produced was 13 (two prototypes and 11 production models), with one 7TP with a new engine being an interim design. No documentation has survived however and this is by no means certain. The 11 tanks could have been either standard 7TP or 7TP with some of the modifications included, but not all of them. The tanks of this batch were incorporated in the 2nd Light Tank Company and took part in the battles during the Siege of Warsaw and served with distinction until the capitulation of the city on 27 September 1939.

It is considered to be the world's first kosher cybercafe.  History  IDT Megabite Cafe is located in New York City's Diamond District. Originally the internet caf√© was a kosher cafe and pizza restaurant. In February 1997, the cafe restaurant was converted into a cybercafe, incorporating a new interior and a kosher sushi bar at a cost of what was about $135,000 at the time. It is considered to be the world's first kosher cybercafe. When the cafe reopened in 1997, it had one computer per dining table, plus two that were exclusively for checking email. In total, there were about a dozen public-use computers. A spokesperson from the IDT Corporation, Howard Jonas, said a wider range of patrons came to the cafe because of the addition. Orthodox Jews, who worked in the Diamond District of New York city, had been the traditional customers, but now that it was a cybercafe, it began to serve a more diverse crowd. To accommodate the new clientele, the Megabite Cafe stayed open two extra hours every night, except Fridays. On Fridays, the cafe closed one hour before the sun went down and did not reopen until Sunday in observance of the Jewish Sabbath. IDT Megabite Cafe was founded by 31-year old Gaddy Haymov who worked the cash register during active lunch times. He was from Israel and partnered with IDT Corporation to establish a kosher cafe and restaurant. Initially, a rabbi was the inspector to make sure the food on the menu coincided with both the Jewish traditions and the Jewish dietary laws. The caf√© became popular for Orthodox weddings, bar mitzvahs, and other Jewish ceremonial events. There was a separate sushi rabbi who made sure the sushi did not contain shellfish or crustaceans. The cybercafe‚Äôs computers had to follow certain Jewish traditions, as did the cafe's menu. The Jewish ideal is a clean body and a clean mind. When the caf√© was full at lunch time, patrons could look at a large poster behind the computers giving them a list of approved items to surf when they got access to a computer. This list included web addresses for the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America and Project Genesis, an educational program for those who follow the Jewish faith.

For example, a futures contract forward curve is prices being plotted as a function of the amount of time between now and the expiry date of the futures contract (with the spot price being the price at time zero). The forward curve represents a term structure of prices.  Forward interest rate  A forward interest rate is a type of interest rate that is specified for a loan that will occur at a specified future date. As with current interest rates, forward interest rates include a term structure which shows the different forward rates offered to loans of different maturities. According to the unbiased expectations hypothesis, forward interest rates predict spot interest rates at the time the loan is actually made, but many analysts dispute whether this is true, as it ignores durational risk. This figure is part of the lending & credit industry and is related as well to the \\"expectations theory\\" which states that forward interest rates can be used as forecasts for future interest rates. Investors expecting higher short-term interest rates are more likely to buy bonds maturing in the short term. If they were to park money into a long term debt they might not be able to make as much interest. Finance analysts can refer to a graph of forward interest rate values over different time periods, the forward curve, to evaluate the time value of money.  Price forward curve  A Price forward curve (short PFC) reflects specialties of the commodity market such as: * Transporting commodities is costly and time- consuming. * It is costly to store commodities - power storage is often prohibitively expensive. * Many commodities show a strong seasonality, e.g. there is more natural gas demanded (for heating) in winter than in summer. In order to fairly value and manage the profitability of energy products it is thus necessary to capture these seasonal price dynamics in a forward curve term-structure. The contract duration of a futures contract is limited by definition and investors have to change their contract during the contract term. Price forward curves help to determine when to do that, two scenarios are possible: # If the PFC is ascending, i.e. future commodity-contracts will be more expensive than at the moment, this is called contango. The investor will have additional costs as they have to sell their futures to a lower price than what they have to invest for their new futures. # If the PFC is descending, it is a so-called backwardation and investors will make money by exchanging (rolling) their old futures contracts to new ones. = Hourly price forward curve = An hourly price forward curve (HPFC) is the construction of a forward curve at a resolution exceeding that known to the market and is as such able to capture the seasonalities of the electricity spot prices. The construction of an HPFC can be based on the combination of two approaches. A statistical approach examines how spot prices have moved in the past. A fundamental model suggests that the price is set purely by supply and demand (respectively, fuel prices on the merit order curve, and load). References Further reading *Floyd, Jhon. E.

Large-scale machine-to-machine communication (M2M) and the internet of things (IoT) are integrated for increased automation, improved communication and self-monitoring, and production of smart machines that can analyze and diagnose issues without the need for human intervention.  History  The phrase Fourth Industrial Revolution was first introduced by Klaus Schwab, executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, in a 2015 article published by Foreign Affairs, \\"Mastering the Fourth Industrial Revolution\\" was the 2016 theme of the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting, in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland. On October 10, 2016, the Forum announced the opening of its Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in San Francisco. This was also subject and title of Schwab's 2016 book. Schwab includes in this fourth era technologies that combine hardware, software, and biology (cyber- physical systems), and emphasizes advances in communication and connectivity. Schwab expects this era to be marked by breakthroughs in emerging technologies in fields such as robotics, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, quantum computing, biotechnology, the internet of things, the industrial internet of things, decentralized consensus, fifth-generation wireless technologies, 3D printing, and fully autonomous vehicles. = Prior to the Fourth Industrial Revolution = The First Industrial Revolution was marked by a transition from hand production methods to machines through the use of steam power and water power. The implementation of new technologies took a long time, so the period which this refers to it is between 1760 and 1820, or 1840 in Europe and the United States. Its effects had consequences on textile manufacturing, which was first to adopt such changes, as well as iron industry, agriculture, and mining although it also had societal effects with an ever stronger middle class. It also had an effect on British industry at the time. The Second Industrial Revolution, also known as the Technological Revolution, is the period between 1871 and 1914 that resulted from installations of extensive railroad and telegraph networks, which allowed for faster transfer of people and ideas, as well as electricity. Increasing electrification allowed for factories to develop the modern production line. It was a period of great economic growth, with an increase in productivity, which also caused a surge in unemployment since many factory workers were replaced by machines. The Third Industrial Revolution, also known as the Digital Revolution, occurred in the late 20th century, after the end of the two world wars, resulting from a slowdown of industrialization and technological advancement compared to previous periods. The global financial crisis in 1929 followed by the Great Depression affected many industrialized countries. The production of the Z1 computer, which used binary floating-point numbers and Boolean logic, a decade later, was the beginning of more advanced digital developments. The next significant development in communication technologies was the supercomputer, with extensive use of computer and communication technologies in the production process; machinery began to abrogate the need for human power. = German strategy = The term \\"Industrie 4.0\\", shortened to I4.0 or simply I4, originated in 2011 from a project in the high-tech strategy of the German government, which promotes the computerization of manufacturing. The term \\"Industrie 4.0\\" was publicly introduced in the same year at the Hannover Fair. In October 2012, the Working Group on Industry 4.0 presented a set of Industry 4.0 implementation recommendations to the German federal government. The workgroup members and partners are recognized as the founding fathers and driving force behind Industry 4.0. On 8 April 2013 at the Hannover Fair, the final report of the Working Group Industry 4.0 was presented.

In: ATP edition - Automatisierungstechnische Praxis, 9/2012, Oldenbourg Verlag, M√ºnchen, September 2012 The largest project in Industry 4.0 as of July 2013 is the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) leading-edge cluster \\"Intelligent Technical Systems Ostwestfalen-Lippe (its OWL)\\". Another major project is the BMBF project RES-COM, as well as the Cluster of Excellence \\"Integrative Production Technology for High-Wage Countries\\". In 2015, the European Commission started the international Horizon 2020 research project CREMA (Providing Cloud-based Rapid Elastic Manufacturing based on the XaaS and Cloud model) as a major initiative to foster the Industry 4.0 topic.  Design principles and goals There are four design principles identified as integral to industry 4.0:Hermann, Pentek, Otto, 2016: Design Principles for Industrie 4.0 Scenarios, accessed on 4 May 2016 * Interconnection ‚Äî the ability of machines, devices, sensors, and people to connect and communicate with each other via the Internet of things, or the internet of people (IoP) * Information transparency ‚Äî the transparency afforded by Industry 4.0 technology provides operators with comprehensive information to inform decisions. Inter-connectivity allows operators to collect immense amounts of data and information from all points in the manufacturing process, identify key areas that can benefit from improvement to increase functionality * Technical assistance ‚Äî the technological facility of systems to assist humans in decision-making and problem-solving, and the ability to help humans with difficult or unsafe tasks * Decentralized decisions ‚Äî the ability of cyber physical systems to make decisions on their own and to perform their tasks as autonomously as possible. Only in the case of exceptions, interference, or conflicting goals, are tasks delegated to a higher levelGronau, Norbert, Marcus Grum, and Benedict Bender. \\"Determining the optimal level of autonomy in cyber-physical production systems.\\" 2016 IEEE 14th International Conference on Industrial Informatics (INDIN). IEEE, 2016. DOI:10.1109/INDIN.2016.7819367  Components  5G Cell Tower The Fourth Industrial Revolution consists of many components when looking closely into our society and current digital trends. To understand how extensive these components are, here are some contributing digital technologies as examples: * Mobile devices * Internet of things (IoT) platforms * Location detection technologies * Advanced human- machine interfaces * Authentication and fraud detection * 3D printing * Smart sensors * Big analytics and advanced processes * Multilevel customer interaction and customer profiling * Augmented reality/ wearables * On-demand availability of computer system resources *Data visualization and triggered \\"live\\" training Mainly these technologies can be summarized into four major components, defining the term ‚ÄúIndustry 4.0‚Äù or ‚Äúsmart factory‚Äù: * Cyber- physical systems * IoT * On-demand availability of computer system resources * Cognitive computing Industry 4.0 networks a wide range of new technologies to create value. Using cyber-physical systems that monitor physical processes, a virtual copy of the physical world can be designed. Characteristics of cyber- physical systems include the ability to make decentralized decisions independently, reaching a high degree of autonomy. = Data = Data and analytics are the core capabilities of each component, driven by: *Digitization and integration of vertical and horizontal value chains ‚Äî Industry 4.0 integrates processes vertically, across the entire organization, including processes in product development, manufacturing, structuring and service; horizontally, Industry 4.0 includes internal operations from suppliers to customers as well as all key value chain partners *Digitization of product and services ‚Äî integrating new methods of data collection and analysis‚Äìsuch as through the expansion of existing products or creation of new digitised products‚Äìhelps companies to generate data on product use in order to refine products *Digital business models and customer access ‚Äî customer satisfaction is a perpetual, multi-stage process that requires modification in real-time to adapt to the changing needs of consumers  Biggest trends  In essence, the Fourth Industrial Revolution is the trend towards automation and data exchange in manufacturing technologies and processes which include cyber- physical systems (CPS), IoT, industrial internet of things, cloud computing,J√ºrgen Jasperneite:Was hinter Begriffen wie Industrie 4.0 steckt in Computer & Automation, 19 December 2012 accessed on 23 December 2012Kagermann, H., W. Wahlster and J. Helbig, eds., 2013: Recommendations for implementing the strategic initiative Industrie 4.0: Final report of the Industrie 4.0 Working GroupHeiner Lasi, Hans-Georg Kemper, Peter Fettke, Thomas Feld, Michael Hoffmann: Industry 4.0. In: Business & Information Systems Engineering 4 (6), pp. 239-242 cognitive computing, and artificial intelligence. = Smart factory = The Fourth Industrial Revolution fosters what has been called a \\"smart factory\\". Within modular structured smart factories, cyber-physical systems monitor physical processes, create a virtual copy of the physical world and make decentralized decisions. Over the internet of things, cyber- physical systems communicate and cooperate with each other and with humans in synchronic time both internally and across organizational services offered and used by participants of the value chain. = Predictive maintenance = Industry 4.0 can also provide predictive maintenance, due to the use of technology and the IoT sensors. Predictive maintenance ‚Äì which can identify maintenance issues in live ‚Äì allows machine owners to perform cost-effective maintenance and determine it ahead of time before the machinery fails or gets damaged. For example, a company in LA could understand if a piece of equipment in Singapore is running at an abnormal speed or temperature. They could then decide whether or not it needs to be repaired. = 3D printing = Relativity Stargate 3D Printer The Fourth Industrial Revolution is said to have extensive dependency on 3D printing technology. Some advantages of 3D printing for industry are that 3D printing can print many geometric structures, as well as simplify the product design process. It is also relatively environmentally friendly. In low-volume production, it can also decrease lead times and total production costs. Moreover, it can increase flexibility, reduce warehousing costs and help the company towards the adoption of a mass customization business strategy. In addition, 3D printing can be very useful for printing spare parts and installing it locally, therefore reducing supplier dependence and reducing the supply lead time. The determining factor is the pace of change. The correlation of the speed of technological development and, as a result, socio-economic and infrastructural transformations with human life allow us to state a qualitative leap in the speed of development, which marks a transition to a new time era.Shestakova I. G. New temporality of digital civilization: the future has already come // // Scientific and Technical Journal of St. Petersburg State Polytechnical University. Humanities and social sciences. 2019. # 2. P.20-29 = Smart sensors = Sensors and instrumentation drive the central forces of innovation, not only for Industry 4.0, but also for other ‚Äúsmart ‚Äù megatrends, such as smart production, smart mobility, smart homes, smart cities and smart factories.Imkamp, D., Berthold, J., Heizmann, M., Kniel, K., Manske, E., Peterek, M., Schmitt, R., Seidler, J., and Sommer, K.-D.: Challenges and trends in manufacturing measurement technology ‚Äì the ‚ÄúIndustrie 4.0‚Äù concept, J. Sens. Sens. Syst., 5, 325‚Äì335, https://doi.org/10.5194/jsss-5-325-2016, 2016 Smart sensors are devices, which generate the data and allow further functionality from self-monitoring and self-configuration to condition monitoring of complex processes. With the capability of wireless communication, they reduce installation effort to a great extent and help realize a dense array of sensors.A.A. Kolomenskii, P.D. Gershon, H.A. Schuessler, Sensitivity and detection limit of concentration and adsorption measurements by laser-induced surface-plasmon resonance, Appl. Opt. 36 (1997) 6539‚Äì6547 The importance of sensors, measurement science, and smart evaluation for Industry 4.0 has been recognized and acknowledged by various experts and has already led to the statement ‚ÄúIndustry 4.0: nothing goes without sensor systems‚Äù Arnold, H.: Kommentar Industrie 4.0: Ohne Sensorsysteme geht nichts, available at: http://www.elektroniknet.de/messen-testen/ sonstiges/artikel/110776/ (last access: 10 March 2018), 2014 However, there are few issues, such as time synchronization error, data loss, and dealing with large amounts of harvested data, which all limit the implementation of full-fledged systems. Moreover, additional limits on these functionalities represents the battery power. One example of the integration of smart sensors in the electronic devices, is the case of smart watches, where sensors receive the data from the movement of the user, process the data and as a result, provide the user with the information about how many steps they have walked in a day and also converts the data into calories burned. Scope of application: Agriculture and food industry: Smart sensors in these two fields are still in the testing stage. These innovative connected sensors collect, interpret and communicate the information available in the plots (leaf area, vegetation index, chlorophyll, hygrometry, temperature, water potential, radiation). Based on this scientific data, the objective is to enable real-time monitoring via a smartphone with a range of advice that optimizes plot management in terms of results, time and costs. On the farm, these sensors can be used to detect crop stages and recommend inputs and treatments at the right time. As well as controlling the level of irrigation. In the food industry: This industry requires more and more security and transparency and full documentation is required. This new technology is used as a tracking system as well as the collection of human data as well as product data. The Fourth Industrial Revolution marks the beginning of the imagination age  Challenges  Challenges in implementation of Industry 4.0: = Economic = * High economic costs * Business model adaptation * Unclear economic benefits/excessive investment = Social = * Privacy concerns * Surveillance and distrust * General reluctance to change by stakeholders * Threat of redundancy of the corporate IT department * Loss of many jobs to automatic processes and IT-controlled processes, especially for blue collar workers = Political = * Lack of regulation, standards and forms of certifications * Unclear legal issues and data security = Organizational = * IT security issues, which are greatly aggravated by the inherent need to open up those previously closed production shops * Reliability and stability needed for critical machine-to-machine communication (M2M), including very short and stable latency times * Need to maintain the integrity of production processes * Need to avoid any IT snags, as those would cause expensive production outages * Need to protect industrial know-how (contained also in the control files for the industrial automation gear) * Lack of adequate skill-sets to expedite the transition towards a fourth industrial revolution * Low top management commitment * Insufficient qualification of employees Applications The aerospace industry has sometimes been characterized as \\"too low volume for extensive automation\\" however Industry 4.0 principles have been investigated by several aerospace companies, technologies have been developed to improve productivity where the upfront cost of automation cannot be justified, one example of this is the aerospace parts manufacturer Meggitt PLC's project, M4. The increasing use of the Industrial Internet of Things is referred to as Industry 4.0 at Bosch, and generally in Germany. Applications include machines that can predict failures and trigger maintenance processes autonomously or self-organized coordination that react to unexpected changes in production. Industry 4.0 inspired Innovation 4.0, a move toward digitization for academia and research and development. In 2017, the ¬£81m Materials Innovation Factory (MIF) at the University of Liverpool opened as a center for computer aided materials science, where robotic formulation, data capture and modeling are being integrated into development practices.

He is best known for the unconventional ride he was given by Willie Carson when winning the 1995 Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot Racecourse.  Background  Bahri, a dark bay or brown horse, was bred at Shadwell Farm near Lexington, Kentucky. He was sired by Riverman who won three Group 1 races in France as a 3-year-old, at distances between 1,600 meters (about a mile) and 1,850 metres (about 1 mile and 1¬º furlongs). His dam, Wasnah also produced one other Group winner, namely, Bahhare, who won the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster, and was a half-sister to the dam of Ajina.  Racing career  = 1994: two-year-old season = Bahri raced four times as a two-year-old coming second in his first 3 maiden races. He won his last race as a two-year-old at Nottingham in a conditions race over six furlongs. = 1995: three-year-old season =  Spring  His first engagement at three was in the Greenham Stakes at Newbury when he came second to Celtic Swing. His next race was the 2,000 Guineas when he lined up against Celtic Swing who was the 4/5 favourite as well as the dual Group 1 winning Pennekamp, he managed to come third in that race behind Pennekamp and Celtic Swing. His next race was the Irish 2,000 Guineas where he again came third but this time to Spectrum.  Summer  Bahri then went on to contest the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot. With some notable absences by Pennekamp and Spectrum taking The Derby route and Celtic Swing taking the Prix du Jockey Club route he came up against the Poule d'Essai des Poulains winner Vettori and the Prix Lupin winner Flemensfirth. Bahri went to the race with a pacemaker in Muhab and subsequently went on to win by four lengths and a head from Charnwood Forest and Vettori. In July Bahri then went on to contest the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood as the evens favourite. Other than his own pacemaker, Sulb, he was the only 3 year old in the race and was only narrowly beaten by a neck by Sayyedati who had contested the race in the previous two runnings. In August he took a step up in trip for the International Stakes at York and couldn't match the subsequent winner Halling who won by three and a half lengths.  Autumn  In September he contested the Queen Elizabeth II stakes at Ascot run on the round course over a mile. According to the form and the odds Bahri (5/2) was no match for the 3 year old filly Ridgewood Pearl (8/13 favourite), again he ran with a pacemaker. Bahri was drawn widest of all the six runners. After the stalls opened Willie Carson took him to the outside rail to ride him under the trees as this is where the better ground was to be found due to the trees protecting the ground from both the watering and the rainfall. The other 5 runners, including his pacemaker, took the shorter and more conventional route against the inside rail on the ground that was described officially as Good to Soft, Soft in places. By the time they had come to the turn and Willie Carson had switched him back to the inside rail he had an advantage of 3 lengths, he then went on to win by six lengths with Ridgewood Pearl in second. His last race was the Champion Stakes where he ended up three and a three quarter lengths 5th behind Spectrum.  Career at Stud  Bahri was retired to stud at Shadwell Stud near Lexington, Kentucky, where he stood for eight years before being transferred to Derrinstown Stud in County Kildare, Ireland. In 2011 he was leased from Derrinstown Stud to stand at Girsonfield Stud in Northumberland. His fee peaked at $40,000 and is currently ¬£2,000. During his time at Shadwell Stud he sired his only Group 1 winner, Sakhee, who won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and the International Stakes at York.

In 1986 Konrad Park joined on drums and they adopted a new name, The Philisteins. In late 1986 they issued their debut album, Reverberations, and soon after relocated to Adelaide and signed with local label, Greasy Pop Records. In December 1988 they released an eight-track extended play, Bloody Convicts, Ian Wettenhall on bass guitar and Nick Bruer on drums. They followed with a six-track EP, Some Kind of Philisteins, in November 1989, with Bruer replaced by Stewart Tabert. Their full-length album, Lifestyles of the Wretched and Forgettable, appeared in November of the next year on Dog Meat Records and they had moved to Melbourne. In September 1992 they disbanded and Lucas, Tabert and Wettenhall joined ex-GOD member, Sean Greenaway in a new group, The Freeloaders. Hibberd was a founding member of indie rock band, Powder Monkeys. In March 1998 Guy Lucas died of a drug overdose. A compilation album, A Savage Affection: 1986‚Äì1992, appeared in December 2007. History The Philisteins formed in Hobart in 1985 as a garage punk band with a line-up of Scott Harrison on bass guitar; Aydn Hibberd on guitar, vocals and harmonica; Guy Lucas on guitar, vocals and organ; and Charlie Shackloth on drums. Originally they performed as The Cheesemongers until Shackloth was replaced on drums by Konrad Park in 1986. Their influences were 1960s R&B; bands from the United Kingdom and American garage punk groups. The new name was supplied by a friend, Stewart Tabert, who recalled \\"I was listening to The Damned's The Black Album and [my mother] came in and said 'Will you shut up, you Philistine!' ... and I thought that's not a bad moniker for the band\\". Late in 1986 the group issued their debut album, Reverberations, as a cassette. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, their \\"raucous blend of punk/ R&B;/psychedelia was soundly despised outside a small cult following\\". Lucas described Reverberations, \\"I don't like it at all...it sucks [...] Me and Stewart drank much of the proceeds before we left the state\\". ‚Äú haha , Guy would say that‚Äù says Hibberd, ‚Äú actually Guy, Scott and I split the bread and it helped us get outta Tassie‚Äù. In February 1987 they relocated to Adelaide and signed with local label, Greasy Pop Records. By that time Mark Coombes had replaced Park on drums. Soon after Harrison was replaced on bass guitar by Ian Wettenhall and Coombes left with Nick Bruer joining on drums. From April to June 1988 they recorded an eight-track extended play, Bloody Convicts, with Doug Thomas producing, which was issued in December. The EP provided a cover version of US band The Lollipop Shoppe's \\"You Must Be a Witch\\". McFarlane described Bloody Convicts sound as \\"neatly between 1970s punk and 1960s psychedelia, with plenty of guitar riffs to the fore\\". By the time of its release Bruer had been replaced by Tabert on drums. It appeared in the US market on the Sympathy for the Record Industry label. In May 1989 they recorded another EP with Thomas producing, Some Kind of Philisteins. A month later they returned to Hobart and by November they were based in Sydney. The six-track EP had appeared in that month, which McFarlane found to have a \\"more punkish edge\\". A four-track version, Some Kind, was issued by Sympathy for the Record Industry into the US market. Three of its tracks came from the Australian EP and a new track, \\"Train to Disaster\\", had been recorded in Melbourne in June. After staying in Sydney for a year, playing more gigs touring outside NSW than in, the group moved to Melbourne where they signed to the local Dog Meat label. In November 1990 they recorded their full-length album, Lifestyles of the Wretched and Forgettable, with Colin Freeman producing. It was released in November of the next year. In 1992 The Philisteins played their last gig at The Doghouse hotel in a quickie farewell tour of Hobart, with Lucas, Tabert and Wettenhall joining Sean Greenaway to form a garage rock group, The Freeloaders. That same year Hibberd was a founding member of Powder Monkeys. In March 1998 Guy Adrian Robert Lucas died of a drug overdose. In December 2007 Off the Hip label issued a 2√ó CD compilation album by The Philisteins, A Savage Affection: 1986‚Äì1992.

Large \\"camel\\" pendulum clock and \\"crane\\" candelabras Fran√ßois R√©mond (c. 1747 ‚Äì 1812) was a French master metalworker and bronze gilder who achieved renown in his day, and whose work is still greatly valued. It included stand-alone works such as candelabras, the decorative casings for clocks and bronze ornamentation for the elaborate furniture made for the elite at the time. Life Fran√ßois R√©mond was born in Paris about 1747, and started his apprenticeship in 1763. In 1774 he became a master in the bronze gilders' guild. He was a prolific worker. He became one of the best regarded of bronze gilders, carvers and casters of his time, producing work that was much in demand from the royal court. He undertook many commissions from the prominent marchand-mercier Dominique Daguerre. He created works in the Turkish style, then in vogue, for the royal family of Louis XVI of France (1754‚Äì1793). R√©mond made urns, firedogs and candelabras. He worked with the bronze caster Pierre Gouthi√®re on some of his larger works before 1788, when Gouthi√®re went bankrupt. Both R√©mond and Gouthi√®re were known for their ability to create matt and burnished gilding. They would make elaborate gilt-bronze mounts for clocks, furniture or statuary that incorporated imaginary or rare creatures such as camels and ostriches. R√©mond also made ornaments and figures for clock makers and furniture mounts for √©b√©nistes. He provided bronze ornamentation for the furniture-maker Jean Henri Riesener (1734-1806). In August 1774 the cabinet-maker David Roentgen, based in the town of Neuwied on the lower Rhine, met R√©mond in Paris. This was to be the start of a long and productive relationship between the two men. In future, most of Roentgen's pieces were ornamented with bronze from Paris, including mounts by R√©mond and sometimes sculptural work from artists such as Louis- Simon Boizot. Roentgen sold a rolltop desk to Catherine the Great in April 1786, decorated in bronze, with a chiming clock. The clock incorporates a bronze sculpture and bronze ornamentation made with great skill and artistry by R√©mond. In a set of five cabinets that Roentgen made for Catherine between 1786 and 1788 R√©mond made the arabesque ornaments on the door panels and bronze medallions of the philosophers Cicero and Plato. An example of his work is an elaborate Neoclassical chimney-piece held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, made in 1784 after a design by Fran√ßois-Joseph B√©langer (1744-1818), with bronze figures representing satyresses sculpted by Jean-Joseph Foucou (1739-1815). It was commissioned for the Grand Salon Ovale of the H√¥tel Thelusson in Paris. The chemin√©e is made of Verde di Levanto marble, patinated bronze and gilt bronze. R√©mond cast the bronze figures and made the decoration. The frieze is entirely decorated with repeating gilt-bronze ornament. Fran√ßois R√©mond died in Paris in 1812.

It is now home to an art gallery and the park is open to the public. History Alfred Hage painted by Constantin Hansen in c. 1854 The estate was founded in 1767 by Adam von L√ºttichau when he purchased Nivaa Havneg√•rd (\\"Nivaa Harbour House\\") from the Crown. The property was from the beginning associated with the Galley Harbour at Nivaa which was planned in 1753 but soon abandoned. The name Nivaagaard was introduced in 1793. The estate was acquired by Alfred Hage in 1862. Alfred Hage's eldest son, Johannes Hage, inherited the estate in 1872. The main building was severely damaged in a fire in 1873. A new main building was completed to design by Ferdinand Vilhelm Jensen in 1881. Nivaagaard was a dominating factor in Nivaa's development over the next decades. Nivaagaard Brickyard The ring oven The first brickyard on the estate was established by Queen Louise in 1701. By 1720 it produced brick for the royal buildings in Copenhagen and the northern part of Zealand. These activities increased and were modernized in the 1840s. In 1857 the brickyard was one of the first in Denmark to introduce a steam engine in the production chain. In 1870, eight years after Alfred Hage had acquired the estate, a circular fire house was constructed, based on plans by Friedrich Hoffmann. The oven remained in use for 97 years up until 1967. The brickyard closed in 1980 and then re-opened as a museum. The ring oven, which is now listed, is the earliest of Hoffmann's designs which still exist today. Art collection The northern wing of the museum Flowering rhododendrons in the park The art collection was founded by Johannes Hage between 1895 and 1905. It covered European Renaissance and Baroque painting and Danish Golden Age art. A small museum building in temple style designed by Johan Schr√∏der was built near the main house in 1903. On 30 September 1908 Hage turned his collection into a self-owning institution which made it available to the public. He chaired the board until his death in 1923. The management of the museum was professionalized in 1981 and it arranged its first special exhibition in 1983. In 1988 the museum building was expanded with support from the Velux Foundation and the Knud H√∏jgaard Foundation. The new wing was designed by royal building inspector David Bretton-Meyer. The European collection contains works by Giovanni Bellini, Claude Lorrain and Rembrandt. The Danish collection contains works by some of the leading artists of the Danish Golden Age, including C.W. Eckersberg, Christen K√∏bke, Johan Lundbye, Wilhelm Marstrand, Martinus R√∏rbye and P. C. Skovgaard. Park The original park was designed by Edvard Gl√¶sel and laid out in 1901-02\\\\. A large rhododendron garden was established in 2007.

History  The gate tower built around 1250 was originally open towards the inside of the city and was only enclosed with a stone wall in 1547. In 1572, a stair turret was added; in the same year Matthias Schw√§ri painted a picture of a merchant with a cart on the inner wall. In the 19th century, this picture sparked a legend about a Swabian man who came to Freiburg with two barrels full of gold to buy the town. He was ridiculed, especially after it turned out that the barrels only contained sand and pebbles. Before his departure, his wife had secretly replaced the gold with a worthless filling. Until 1900 the Schwabentor remained mostly unchanged. Then it was almost doubled in height according to the design of Carl Sch√§fer and equipped with a crow-stepped gable modelled on city towers of Northern Germany. In 1903 Fritz Geiges added a painting of Freiburg‚Äôs city patron, [Saint George], depicted as a dragon hunter on the exterior. The conversions ended in 1913 with the building of historicized annexes. The conversion was partially undone in 1954, and the Schwabentor was provided with a simpler tented roof, which was similar to the original one, and a bell turret with an onion dome. The keystone of the inner arch shows a Romanesque depiction of the \\"Boy with Thorn\\", an antique figurine, which is interpreted in a Christian way here, meaning that man walks the earth with the thorn of the Original sin within him. Whoever passes through the gate should be reminded of it. Next to the gate there is a square, which is unofficially called Platz der letzten Barrikade von 1848 (English \\"Square of the Last Barricade of 1848\\"). On Easter Monday of 1848, an association of independent, military volunteers of Baden was defeated by the superior government troops of the Grand Duke of Baden. The Schwabentor is being renovated since summer 2012 and is to be finished in November 2013.Schwabentor bleibt zum Teil bis Ende 2013 einger√ºstet , freiburg.de After removing the plaster it became apparent that the damages were more severe than anticipated. The previous extension of the tower produced fissures in the walls, and the foundation has to be reinforced because it isn't stable enough. To examine this, exploratory drillings were scheduled for April 2013.N√§chtlicher L√§rm durch Arbeiten am SchwabentorRisse im Schwabentor ‚Äì Sanierung dauert bis Ende 2013, Badische Zeitung  Traffic  The Schwabentor is located on the border of the pedestrian area of the city centre and usually only one line of Freiburg‚Äôs tram's goes through it heading outside of the town. The annex on the north side is reserved for the tram, bikers, taxis, delivery traffic and inhabitants of the city centre heading downtown. All other traffic is led past its right hand side.  Museum  Since 1969 there is a small, private museum, named the Zinnfigurenklause (German Zinnfigur is a tin figure) in the Schwabentor. Different scenes of the region's history are depicted in the museum, with the help of about 9,000 tin figures in Dioramas, mostly from the freedom movements in the South of Germany (Battle of Sempach, peasant revolts, Revolution of 1848 in Baden), but also from the time of the Protestant Reformation.

Born in Rome, he gave his first concert in 1897, aged fifteen, and he went on to tour Europe to great acclaim. It was his desire to elevate the Mandolin to a status similar to the violin in classical music, and he did much to contribute to the immense popularity of the mandolin in the 1920s. Later settling in Brussels he established a tradition of Mandolin music in northern Europe. He always played Mandolins produced by Luigi Embergher, which he compared to the Stradivarius violin in perfection. Ranieri once visited Embergher's shop in Rome and tried out an instrument marked Gold Medal Paris 1900. When he wanted to buy it the luthier replied that it was not for sale, but that he could play it at the evening recital. After the recital Embergher approached Ranieri and offered him the instrument as a gift. Advertisement for music publisher J. Rowies (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) for mandolin sheet music.

Common mobile recruiting tactics include mobile career sites, mobile recruiting by text, mobile recruiting apps and social recruiting. Mobile recruiting is often cited as a growing opportunity for recruiters to connect with candidates more efficiently with \\"over 89% of job seekers saying their mobile device will be an important tool and resource for their job search.\\" Traditionally, recruiters have used emails and phone calls to engage candidates, but the increase in mobile usage among job seekers has contributed to mobile recruiting's rising popularity. Mobile Career Sites Mobile career sites are browser-based, mobile-friendly career sites that use responsive design so candidates can easily research career opportunities and apply for them via their mobile devices. These career sites typically bypass resumes and cover letters since these documents can make it difficult to apply via mobile devices, and allow applicants to use social media profiles instead.  Mobile Recruiting by Text  Mobile recruiting by text uses text messaging to attract and engage candidates on their mobile devices. Recruiters can attract candidates by placing a short code and keyword such as text \\"jobs\\" to \\"55555\\" in locations such as universities, corporate campuses, retail locations, hospitals and restaurants to grow their candidate pipeline. Recruiters can also engage candidates on their mobile devices using text messaging to notify them of new career opportunities, schedule interviews and manage employee onboarding.  Mobile Recruiting Apps  Mobile recruiting apps are mobile apps that recruiters can use to post career opportunities that are optimized for mobile devices, and candidates can use to submit job applications. They are not browser-based and require job seekers to download a mobile app. Social Recruiting Social recruiting is recruiting candidates by using social platforms as talent databases and for employer branding, and is considered a type of mobile recruiting when attracting or engaging candidates on their mobile devices.

This work was exhibited at the Salon d'Automne, 1913 (no. 768) and Moderni Umeni, 45th Exhibition of SVU M√°nes in Prague 1914 (no. 47), and several major exhibitions the following years. Executed in a highly Cubist idiom, the work nevertheless retains recognizable elements relative to its subject matter. The painting represents Eug√®ne Figui√®re. Head of his own publishing company, Figui√®re strove to be identified with every modern development. In 1912 he published the first and only manifesto on Cubism entitled Du \\"Cubisme\\", written by Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger. In 1913 Figui√®re published Les Peintres Cubistes, M√©ditations Esth√©tiques (The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations), by Guillaume Apollinaire. The painting, purchased directly from the artist in 1948, is in the permanent collection of the Mus√©e des beaux-arts de Lyon, France. Description Portrait of Eug√®ne Figui√®re is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 143.5 by l01.5 cm (56.5 x 40 inches) signed and dated \\"Alb Gleizes 13\\", lower right. Studies for this work likely began during the spring or summer of 1913 while the full portrait was completed during the late summer or early fall of 1913. The work represents Eug√®ne Figui√®re who is closely associated with Gleizes' friends from the Abbaye de Cr√©teil, Jacques Nayral and Alexandre Mercereau. Eug√®ne Figui√®re, head of his own publishing company, strove to be identified with every modern development. In this portrait which Salmon admired for its \\"fine and most adroit psychology\\", he is surrounded by his publications which were written by Gleizes' friends: Alexandre Mercereau, Georges Polti, Guillaume Apollinaire, Jean Metzinger, Paul Fort, Gustave Kahn, Henri-Martin Barzun and Jacques Nayral.Robbins, Daniel, The Solomon R.

In this picture Gleizes merges the sitter with the environment, blurring the distinction between background and foreground. In addition to the simultaneous views and multiple perspective, the artist has included the image of a clock in the upper left quadrant (as in Metzinger's Nu √† la chemin√©e, Nude of 1910), a fact that reveals Gleizes' didactic visual and literary reference to the mathematician and philosopher of science Henri Poincar√©, and to the philosopher Henri Bergson's concept of 'duration'.Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, Cubism and Culture, Thames & Hudson, 2001 Outlining his practice at the time, in an essay published in February 1913 in Montjoie! Gleizes writes: > It is sufficient for me to say, quickly, that painters today only consider > the object in relation to the totality of things and, with regard to itself, > in relation to the totality of its aspects. As they are not unaware of the > fact that a form which is more pronounced dominates those which are less > pronounced, the plastic dynamism will be born from the rhythmic relations of > objects to objects, as with the different aspects of one and the same > object, juxtaposed‚Äînot superposed, as some would like to believe‚Äîwith all > the sensibility and taste of the painter for whom those are the only rules. > (Gleizes, 1913)Peter Brooke, For and Against the Twentieth Century, Yale > University Press, 2001 Eug√®ne Figui√®re La Section d'Or exhibition, 1925, Galerie Vavin-Raspail, Paris. Gleizes' Portrait de Eug√®ne Figui√®re, La Chasse (The Hunt), and Les Baigneuses (The Bathers) are seen towards the center La Revue Ind√©pendante began publication in June 1911 under the patronage ('D√©p√¥t g√©n√©rale') of Eug√®ne Figui√®re, later publisher of Du \\"Cubisme\\" and of Apollinaire's Aesthetic Meditations - The Cubist Painters. According to Gladys Fabre, Figui√®re's publishing house opened in 1910 was a successor, via the Biblioth√®que des douze and the Oeuvres du jour to the Abbaye de Cr√©teil's own publishing house which, after the closure of the Abbaye itself in 1908, had continued in Paris. The contributors included the poet Paul Fort together with Alexandre Mercereau, Paul Castiaux, H.M. Barzun, Roger Allard and, quite prominently, Jacques Nayral, Gleizes' friend and later brother in law, subject of the great portrait which must have been done about this time. Nayral had contributed previous pieces in the series L'Art et ses repr√©sentants, on Mahler and on the writer Gaston Deschamps (1861-1931). Daniel Robbins' Albert Gleizes, 1881-1953, A Retrospective Exhibition, Guggenheim, 1964, mentions another article in the series by Gleizes, on Le Fauconnier, but this does not seem to have appeared in print.Albert Gleizes, L'Art et ses repr√©sentants - Jean Metzinger, La Revue Ind√©pendante, no 4, Sept 1911 =Major publications= * Allard, Roger, Le Bocage ou le divertissement des amants citadins et champetres, Paris, \\"Oeuvres et jours\\", Figui√®re, 1911.

Gleizes exhibits in the Armory Show in New York, Chicago and Boston, introducing Cubism to an American audience. An essay by him, Le Cubisme et la Tradition, attacking the Italian Renaissance and its influence on French art, is published by the Italian born Riccardo Canudo (1877-1923) in his journal, Montjoie!. Figui√®re publishes a collection of essays by Apollinaire, Les Peintres Cubistes, M√©ditations Esth√©tiques. Apollinaire uses the word 'la majest√©' to characterise Gleizes. In the Salon d'Automne Gleizes exhibits Portrait de Figui√®re and La Ville et le Fleuve, a monumental successor to Le D√©piquage des Moissons (Harvest Threshing) (it has since been lost). At the Salon, Canudo introduces him to Juliette Roche (1884-1982), daughter of a powerful government minister, Jules Roche, and a member of the circle which is portrayed in Proust's A la recherche du temps perdu. Albert Gleizes writes in 1925: > The year 1913 saw the movement continuing to evolve. The changes it had > already undergone since the Ind√©pendants of 1911 could leave people in no > doubt as to its nature. Cubism was not a school, distinguished by some > superficial variation on a generally accepted norm. It was a total > regeneration, indicating the emergence of a wholly new cast of mind. Every > season it appeared renewed, growing like a living body. Its enemies could, > eventually, have forgiven it if only it had passed away, like a fashion; but > they became even more violent when they realised that it was destined to > live a life that would be longer than that of those painters who had been > the first to assume the responsibility for it. > > At the 1913 Salon des Ind√©pendants could be seen a very large work of Jean > Metzinger's - L'Oiseau Bleu; Robert Delaunay showed L'Equipe de Cardiff; two > important canvasses from L√©ger; still lifes and L'Homme au Caf√© from Juan > Gris; enthusiastic new work from La Fresnaye and from Marcoussis, and from > others again; and finally, from myself, Les Joueurs de Football. > > Again, to the Salon d'Automne of 1913 - a salon in which Cubism was now the > predominating tendency - Metzinger sent the great picture called En B√¢teau > (En Canot, Im Boot), La Fresnaye La Conqu√™te de l'Air, myself Les B√¢teaux de > P√™che and La Ville et le Fleuve.

It is > enough for proof to read the diatribes of Louis Vauxcelles in Gil Blas for > that year,1913, and the panegyrics of Guillaume Apollinaire in > L'Intransigeant. Salon d'Automne, 1913 By 1913 the predominate tendency in modern art visible at the Salon d'Automne consisted of Cubism with a clear tendency towards abstraction. The trend to use brighter colors that had already begun in 1911 continued through 1912 and 1913. This exhibition, held from 15 November to 8 January 1914, was dominated by de La Fresnaye, Gleizes and Picabia. Works by Delaunay, Duchamp and L√©ger were not exhibited. The preface of the catalog was written by the French Socialist politician Marcel Sembat who a year earlier‚Äîagainst the outcry of Jules-Louis Breton regarding the use of public funds to provide the venue (at the Salon d'Automne) to exhibit 'barbaric' art‚Äîhad defended the Cubists, and freedom of artistic expression in general, in the National Assembly of France.David Cottington, 2004, Cubism and its Histories , Chapter 1, Cubism, the avant-garde and the liberal Republic, p. 3, Manchester University PressPatrick F.

On 2 July 1950 the 19th Bombardment Group launched a strike on Yonpo Airfield based on faulty intelligence there were 65 Korean People's Air Force (KPAF) aircraft there, but only 16 KPAF aircraft were in the field, none of which were damaged by the airstrike. On 19 July carrier aircraft of Task Force 77 attacked Yonpo destroying 15 aircraft. The Yonpo area was captured by the 5th and 7th Marine Regiments advancing from Wonsan on 30 October 1950 and the airfield was put into service by the UN forces. The USAF designated the base K-27. The 35th Fighter-Interceptor Group moved to the base on 18 November and was joined by the Marine Aircraft Group 12 on 1 December, both provided close air support to the U. S.

The site was formerly nine-hole Orenco Woods Golf Course in the Orenco neighborhood owned by the Hillsboro Elks. The eastern edge is bounded by Cornelius Pass Road and the tracks for the MAX Blue Line form the northern boundary. Rock Creek flows through the site between Orchard Park upstream and Noble Woods Park downstream, with the Rock Creek Trail planned to connect all three parks. History The nine-hole Orenco Woods Golf Course was purchased by Venture Properties in 2007. The company planned to build more than 280 homes on the 40-acre site, but the project never came to fruition due to the Great Recession and the efforts of local residents. The city had designated Orenco Woods as \\"open space,\\" but Hillsboro leaders re-zoned the land for development of 252 single-family homes at the request of developer Venture Properties in 2005. Some Orenco neighborhood residents unsuccessfully protested the change, Hillsboro resident Jim Lubischer is credited with spearheading the effort to ensure a public park was included. Noting a rapidly diminishing supply of suitable land and Hillsboro's own Parks & Trails Master Plan including targets not being met, Lubischer took the appeal to include park space to court in repeated failed attempts, including to the Oregon Supreme Court. During these appeals, the downturned economy led Venture to abandon its original plan. A request to include commercial properties was denied by the city in 2008, and the property was eventually foreclosed by U.S. Bank. Local realtor Dirk Knudsen then worked for two years to get a call back from the bank in order to determine the broker charged with selling the property before a sale was opened to new housing developers. Once he was able to locate the broker, Knudsen successfully built a coalition to raise funding for a public park and negotiate with the bank. The City of Hillsboro and Metro purchased the land in 2011 for $4 million. The city sold at the southeast corner to home builder Polygon Northwest Company in January 2013. The proceeds from $3.4 million deal were planned to be used to develop the park. Metro approved the master plan for the park in November 2013. The park opened on February 4, 2017. Amenities The park has , mostly devoted to open space. Orenco Woods includes public restrooms, a picnic shelter, trails, two bridges, and nature-themed play area.

The Flying Circus or Flying Circus) is a 1933 American Pre-Code action film dealing with aviation. The film was directed by former Hollywood agent Russell Birdwell and photographed by film noir cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca.

In an unusual move, Bruce Cabot was the star, with perennial \\"good guy\\" Ralph Bellamy playing the villain in a love triangle involving Arline Judge and Eric Linden. Although considered a \\"B\\" feature, audiences enjoyed the aerial scenes, which helped elevate the feature to a minor box-office hit. Plot The \\"Black Cats\\", who are part of the Aerial Circus run by \\"Speed\\" Hardy (Ralph Bellamy), are a vagabond troupe of aerial performers in the 1930s. Speed takes on a new performer, former airmail pilot Ace Murray (Bruce Cabot). After performing a \\"double parachute\\" jump with his kid brother Bud (Eric Linden), who is also a pilot, Ace becomes aware that his brother is enamoured with Speed's young wife Ann (Arline Judge). Bud and Ann perform the dangerous double parachute jump together, becoming the show's main attraction, but Speed becomes jealous of the romance forming between them. After a flight together, Bud and Ann crash-land and spend a night in a deserted cabin, leading to the realization that Ann must seek a divorce. When Speed discovers them, he apparently agrees to the new circumstances and surprisingly offers to design a new aerial stunt for Bud and himself that will have two aircraft colliding \\"head-on\\", with both of the pilots bailing out before the impact. Before the stunt takes place, another pilot who is usually inebriated, \\"Screwy\\" Edwards (Cliff Edwards), reveals that Speed has deliberately cut his rival's parachute and is planning an aerial murder. Ace takes off and crashes into Speed, sacrificing his life to save his brother. The two lovers eventually marry and due to Ace's earlier help in obtaining a job for him, Bud begins an airline career as a pilot alongside Edwards, who has begun a rehabilitation.

Reception In his August 26, 1933, review in The New York Times, Frank Nugent considered Flying Devils as a tried and true formula film. \\"The materials woven into its plot have seen so much service that most audiences will welcome them as old and trusted friends. There are, for example, the eternal triangle, brotherly love, the enaction of the theme, 'greater love hath no man,' &c.;, and, finally, the always simple expedient of killing off the non-essential characters.\\"Nugent, Frank S. \\"Flying Devils (1933): The infernal triangle.\\" The New York Times, August 26, 1933. Richard B. Jewell, Professor of American Film at the University of Southern California, wrote in The RKO Story, \\"... director Russell Birdwell, best known as one of the demon press agents of the era, was able to pump enough zip into the proceedings to please the public; it became a bantam box- office hit.\\"Jewell 1982, p. 64.

It comprises the Irigaray central processing plant and wellfields, and the Christensen Ranch ion exchange plant and wellfields. Project history The uranium deposits at Irigaray and Christensen ranches were discovered in 1973. In July 1974, Wyoming Mineral Corporation (WMC), a subsidiary of Westinghouse Electric Corporation, established a pilot uranium recovery plant at the Irigaray site. A commercial source material license was issued in November 1978. In 1982, operations ceased at the Irigaray plant and well fields, and the facility was placed on standby status pending improvements in the uranium market. During this period, the Christensen Ranch facility was developed under an R&D; license issued by the NRC in 1978 to Western Nuclear, Inc. (WNI), a subsidiary of Phelps Dodge Corporation (now Freeport-McMoRan). Research had been performed at one location, the Willow Creek R&D; site. In 1985, WNI sold its interest in the Christensen Ranch project to Malapai Resources Company, a subsidiary of electricity utility Arizona Public Service. Malapai purchased the Irigaray site from Westinghouse in June 1987, and resumed operations. The Christensen Ranch satellite ion exchange plant and its associated well fields were included under the same license in 1988. The Irigaray project was then upgraded to include facilities for processing ion exchange resin from Christensen Ranch, and the flow rate of the Irigaray recovery plant was increased to 2,400 gallons per minute capacity. Operations under Malapai continued until February 1990. In 1990, Malapai was sold to Electricit√© de France (EdF), a French state nuclear utility. Operations resumed in 1991. In 1993 another French state-owned company, COGEMA Mining Inc. (now called Areva), acquired EdF's properties in Wyoming and Texas and continued the in- situ recovery operation until June 2000. In April 2007, COGEMA applied to recommence operations, which was approved on 30 September 2008. On 25 January 2010, Uranium One USA, Inc. bought COGEMA's US assets. The NRC approved the return to active uranium recovery operations at Willow Creek, in December 2010. On 27 December 2010, Rosatom State Atomic Energy Corporation completed the purchase of Uranium One.  Reserves  As of December 31, 2016 Willow Creek had proven and probable reserves of 6.49 million tonnes of ore grading 0.036% uranium (6.09 million pounds U3O8). Although Willow Creek has a permitted annual production capacity of 1.3 million lbs U3O8, since 2014, production has been scaled back and well field development put on hold, due to low uranium prices. In 2016, it produced 59,900 lbs U3O8.

The Dan people refer to these masks as gle or ge, terms that refers both to the physical mask and the individual spirits the mask is believed to embody during masquerade performances. Gle Scholars use the terms ge and gle interchangeably to refer both to Dan masks and to invisible, supernatural spirit forces that live in the forest but esteem to enter the civilized world of the village. The only way they can do this, the Dan believe, is through masquerade. In order for a gle to be embodied during a masquerade, an initiated member of a Dan men's society must have a dream that reveals the exact nature of the gle, its intended function, and the masquerade through which the gle would manifest. The council of elders, once they are told of the dream, decides whether the masquerade ensemble should be created for that man to wear and perform. The wooden gle is accompanied by a full-body costume constructed of raffia, feathers and fur. It is believed that each gle has its own personality, preferences, dance and speech patterns and is given a personal name. The wearer of the mask takes on all of these qualities during the masquerade. Having come from the dark, mysterious realm of the forest, a gle is believed to be unpredictable. Therefore, an attendant always accompanies the gle masquerader to control it and interpret its speech. Dean gle and Bu gle masks Gle can be divided into two categories: that of dean gle, which is a gentle, peaceful gle without a gender, but whose qualities are thought of as feminine and that of bu gle, which is the war gle named after the sound of a gunshot, whose qualities are thought of as masculine. The dean gle mask represents an idealized version of Dan beauty. It is characterized by narrow eyes, an oval shape, a smooth forehead, and a mouth slightly open to expose teeth. Dean gle's functions are to teach, entertain and nurture. Bugle masks are designed to frighten. Their eyes are depicted as protruding tubes and the surface of the face has boldly projecting angles. The most powerful bugle masks are decorated with animal and human deposits such a bone and fur. Ma go, personal miniature masks Dan personal miniature masks, from the collection of the Brooklyn Museum Similar to gle masks, miniature masks are carved to embody du tutelary spirits, but their main function is the protection of their owner from harm. These masks may also be used in divination and as sacred objects upon which to swear an oath - thus man go are treated like other sacred objects and are fed with ritual offerings and kept hidden from public display. In some cases, an owner of a full-sized mask may carry a miniature version of the large mask to serve as a ma go. Mask classifications Vandenhoute distinguished two large groups of masks: the gebande and the genome. Gebande is the most sacred examples of Dan masks while Genome is a lower rank of masks. The classifications relate to the content which the Dan attribute to the mask, rather than the appearance of the mask. Gebande masks can be divided into a series of subgroups and categories: Subgroups: * Singers‚Äô masks * Dancers‚Äô masks * Storytellers‚Äô masks * Beggars‚Äô masks (their primary job is the collecting of offerings for ancestors) Categories: * Gore or ancestor masks (the most sacred of masks) * Gesuya or avenger masks (stands up to the Go master and the ancestors) * Miniature masks (substitutes for Goge or Gesuya masks) * Sagbwe masks (runners‚Äô mask or fire watchers‚Äô mask) Gle performance Daniel B. Reed calls music the \\"fuel\\" that drives gle performance. Reed writes, \\"Performers use music to attract the spiritual power that enables them to solve sorcery conflicts and heal, manifesting Dan spiritual powers in collaboration with the Ivorian judiciary to combat socially destructive spiritual behaviors.\\" Contemporary gle performances incorporate elements of popular culture. For example, gle may reference technology, mention Jesus or Allah, incorporate mass-mediated popular music and sing or speak in many languages. Before a gle can perform, his performance must first be approved be the proper authorities - those affiliated with the \\"sacred house\\" of a particular gle. A person or group of people may hire a gle, but in order to do so they must also present their reasons why, as well as where, when and how the gle will perform, to these same authorities. The process that the authorities undergo to determine whether the gle can perform is shrouded in secrecy, but essentially the authories consult a powerful spirit, called the yinan, by \\"throwing\\" kola nuts, a process used in divination. If the answer is \\"yes\\" to the question of whether the gle can perform, then the cost of the performance is assessed and the performance planning begins. There are a series of rules that must be followed in order for the gle to manifest. Many of these concern women, who are forbidden from seeing certain genu (pl. gle).

Many of the same building techniques were later adapted by Spanish colonists into a regional form of Spanish Colonial architecture. Pueblo architecture was also the basis for Pueblo Revival architecture, a 20th- century regional revival style that remains popular. History Ancestral Puebloan people first began building pueblo structures during the Pueblo I Period (750‚Äì900 CE). When Spanish colonists arrived in the Southwest beginning in the late 1500s, they learned the local construction techniques from the Pueblo people and adapted them to fit their own building types, such as haciendas and mission churches. The Pueblo people also adopted some of the Spanish innovations, including manufacture of sun-baked adobe bricks. As modern building materials like brick, glass, and milled lumber became more available during the Territorial period and especially with the arrival of railroads in the 1870s and 1880s, the traditional construction methods fell out of favor, though they remained commonplace in rural areas. Pueblo architecture experienced a resurgence in the 1920s and 1930s as a romanticized revival style, Pueblo Revival, and remains popular in New Mexico. Characteristics Pueblo buildings are most commonly constructed from adobe, though stone was also used where available, for instance at Chaco Canyon. The buildings have flat roofs supported by rough-hewn wooden beams called vigas and smaller perpendicular laths or latillas. The vigas typically extend through the exterior wall surface. Larger structures often take the form of multistory terraces with setbacks at each level. Traditionally, upper floors were accessed by ladders, and buildings were often semi-fortified with minimal door and window openings at ground level. Other key elements of Pueblo architecture include kivas, which are circular ceremonial rooms which are partially or fully below ground, and enclosed courtyards or plazas.

The Gothic style first appeared in the Czech lands in the first half of the 13th century and was usual there until the early 16th century. The phases of the development of the Gothic architecture in the Czech lands are often named after the Bohemian ruling dynasty of the corresponding time: * Early Gothic ‚Äì P≈ôemyslid Gothic (13th and early 14th century) * High Gothic ‚Äì Luxembourg Gothic (14th and early 15th century) * Late Gothic ‚Äì Jagiellonian Gothic (approximately 1471‚Äì1526)> The most significant Gothic architects who worked in the Czech lands (especially in Bohemia) were Peter Parler and Benedikt Rejt.  Early Gothic  Portal of the church of Porta coeli Convent in Ti≈°nov near Brno, Moravia, 1230s. Portal of the Old New Synagogue in Prague using vine-leaf motifs, after 1270. The Gothic style penetrated the Czech lands in the first half of the 13th century ‚Äì in the time when the Romanesque style flourished in Bohemia and the High Gothic in France. In the 13th century the Kingdom of Bohemia became a stable country and the growth of the political and economical importance of Bohemia mirrored also in the art. Until that time the cultural development of the Czech lands was obviously delayed in comparison with Western Europe. In the 13th century many monasteries, convents, cities, towns and villages were founded. It was the time of colonization of the still uninhabited areas of the Kingdom. The Czech nobility accepted the culture of knights, so they listened to the German Minnesingers, participated in tournaments, got their coat of arms and built castles of stone. Thanks to the newly found silver mines the Kingdom was becoming richer (e. g. Jihlava, St≈ô√≠bro or Kutn√° Hora). In the 1240s last purely Romanesque churches were built (e. g. in Vinec, Potvorov, Tismice or Kondrac). In the 1230s first Early Gothic buildings were built in the \\"transitional\\" style brought to Bohemia and Moravia by the Order of Cistercians. Their buildings were not very fancy and they often used leaf and berry motifs, especially on the capitals. The Cistercians were the most important builders of the very Early Gothic style architecture in the Czech lands. Tepl√° Abbey Church, Bohemia, consecrated in 1232 The Church of Tepl√° Abbey (Premonstratensians) consecrated in 1232 is one of the oldest Gothic churches in Bohemia. Other important Early Gothic building is the Osek Monastery (Cistercians) in Bohemia with its unique Chapter hall. The first Gothic building in Moravia was the Monastery of Cistercian nuns Porta Coeli in P≈ôedkl√°≈°te≈ô√≠ u Ti≈°nova near Brno founded by Constance of Hungary, Queen of Bohemia in 1233 and concentrated in 1239. There are the oldest traceries of the rose windows in the Czech lands and the very fancy portal built in the style of the French cathedrals was unique in Central Europe of that time. The St. Procopius Basilica in T≈ôeb√≠ƒç is considered to be the most bizarre work of the European architecture of the second third of the 13th century. The architecture of this former Benedictine abbey church in T≈ôeb√≠ƒç is a unique mixture of Romanesque and Gothic style. It was not built in the \\"transitional\\" Romanesque-Gothic style but the builders used elements of the both styles in its mature forms and so created a building which is purely Romanesque and Gothic at the same time. Therefore, it is listed in the UNESCO World Heritage List. The oldest Gothic building in Prague is the Convent of St. Agnes founded in 1231 by the Bohemian Princess Agnes of Bohemia (later canonized). It was the first convent of the Poor Clares outside Italy. The first church of this convent (St. Francis Church) was completed in 1234 and it is said to be the oldest vaulted mendicant order church north of the Alps. The Church of Christ the Saviour built in 1261‚Äì1265 as the royal mausoleum of P≈ôemyslid dynasty by King Ottokar II of Bohemia was directly influenced by the French Gothic architecture. Arcades of Royal Castle in P√≠sek form the second half of the 13th century In the new-founded rich mining town Jihlava there were built three Early Gothic churches (parish, Minorite and Dominicane) in the 1240s which also belong to the oldest preserved Gothic churches in the Czech lands. After the 1260s the influence of the Cistercian style diminished and the Czech architecture was then inspired by the French High Gothic architecture. In southern Bohemia there worked the royal builders employed by the King Ottokar II of Bohemia. In the Royal Town of P√≠sek there they built some important buildings (Royal Castle, P√≠sek Stone Bridge, parish church). They also built the Zv√≠kov Castle with a central court surrounded by arcades in two levels inspired by the cloister ‚Äî typical element of the monastic architecture. The chapel of the castle was completed in 1270. Other important castles are the royal Bezdƒõz Castle (with its beautiful chapel) and K≈ôivokl√°t Castle, the bishop's Hor≈°ovsk√Ω T√Ωn Castle (its chapel has been preserved, other parts were later rebuilt). In Moravia there are the ≈†pilberk Castle in Brno, Veve≈ô√≠ Castle, Buchlov, Hukvaldy or others. The Old New Synagogue in the Jewish Quarter of the Old Town of Prague was built around 1270 by stonemasons of the royal workshop who also built the Convent of St. Agnes. This twin-nave synagogue is one of the oldest preserved in Europe and the oldest still active in Europe. The style of the Old New Synagogue resembles the Cistercian monasteries Zlat√° Koruna (founded in 1263) and Vy≈°≈°√≠ Brod (founded in 1259). In Vy≈°≈°√≠ Brod very precious Early Gothic Chapter hall from 1285 has been preserved. These monasteries were then completed in the High Gothic style.

In that time the Gothic style in the Czech lands changed. The new buildings started to emphasize the verticality and light very strongly. In the Cistercian Sedlec Abbey near Kutn√° Hora, the first church in the style of French Gothic cathedrals in the Czech lands was built around 1300. It is called the Church of the Assumption of Our Lady and Saint John the Baptist and although it was rebuilt in the 18th century in the Baroque Gothic style its presbytery, main nave and transept didn't lose its original appearance. It is considered to be one of the first High Gothic buildings in the Czech Republic and it was also inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. A very similar church was built in another Cistercian monastery in Zbraslav. In its time it was the biggest church in Bohemia ‚Äì it was 104 meters long. The Zbraslav Cathedral was destroyed during the Hussite Wars. = Luxembourg Gothic = Bridge Tower of Charles Bridge in Prague The first king of the new Luxembourg dynasty John of Luxembourg was not a great founder of new buildings. He probably rebuilt the Stone Bell House on the Old Town Square in Prague after 1310. In this time the house was decorated with great statues and paintings and was probably used as a royal residence instead of the Prague Castle which was uninhabitable after the fire in 1303. The Bishop of Prague Jan IV. z Dra≈æic supported the new architecture instead of the king who was often absent in the country. He founded a new workshop in his town Roudnice nad Labem to which he invited south-French builders. He started to build a new bridge in Roudnice over the river Elbe (). He also invited a bridge architect William of Avignon for one year who taught the local stonemasons so that they could finish the bridge construction on their own. The Bishop also founded a new monastery with a church in Roudnice and new castles in Litovice and Dra≈æice. He also founded a new monumental St Giles's Church () in the Old Town of Prague and rebuilt the Bishop's residence in the Lesser Town of Prague (was destroyed during the Hussite Wars).  The reign of Charles IV and Wenceslaus IV  The heyday of the High Gothic art in the Czech lands came with John's son Charles IV. This young Bohemian Prince came to Bohemia in 1333 from France where he had been raised at the French royal court. Then he became as the first king of Bohemia the Holy Roman Emperor and so Prague became the imperial residence. The reign of Emperor Charles IV and his son King Wenceslaus IV is one of the very few periods of the Czech art when it was at the comparable level with the European development and even became the leading force in the development of European art.> Northern portal of the Church of Our Lady before T√Ωn in the Old Town of Prague built by Parler's workshop Charles IV was a very important supporter of art. He founded many new buildings, for example the most important High Gothic building in the Czech Republic ‚Äì the St. Vitus Cathedral at the Prague Castle ‚Äì which was founded by him, his father King John and the Prague Archbishop Arno≈°t of Pardubice in 1344. The first architect was a Frenchman Matthias of Arras who designed the church in the French Gothic style. After his death Petr Parler (who came from Germany) became the architect of the cathedral and changed the older plans. Peter Parler built a net vault in the main nave, one of the first net vaults in the continental Europe. This net vault then inspired the vaults in many central-European churches (e. g. in Milevsko, ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov or Nysa in Poland). One of the most precious spaces of the cathedral is St. Wenceslas Chapel which resembles the Chapel of the Holy Cross at the Karl≈°tejn Castle in central Bohemia. The building of the cathedral was interrupted by Hussite Wars and was completed first in the early 20th century. Charles IV also ordered to rebuild the Old Royal Palace at the Prague Castle, his son Wenceslaus IV then continued in the rebuilding after Charles's death. Another important building of Prague High Gothic architecture is Charles Bridge with its Old Town Bridge Tower built by Petr Parler and which is one of the largest and most beautiful Gothic gates in Europe. Petr Parler also designed the new presbytery of St. Bartholomew Church in Kol√≠n (). The work of Petr Parler later became a great inspiration for central-European Late Gothic architects. The most important Czech High Gothic castle is the Karl≈°tejn Castle built in 1348‚Äì1357 (and decorated until 1367) where the unique Chapel of the Holy Cross can be seen which should have looked like the Heavenly Jerusalem and in which the most precious holy relics and jewels of the Kingdom of Bohemia and Holy Roman Empire were kept (e. g. the Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire). Its walls are decorated with precious stones and with 130 pictures of saints painted by Theodoric of Prague, its golden ceiling resembles the sky with stars, sun and moon. During the reign of Wenceslaus IV the Gothic style changed a bit into the so-called International Gothic which was characterized by replacing monumentality with elegance (therefore it is also known as the \\"Beautiful style\\"). Typical for the International Gothic architecture especially in Central Europe were the hall churches. The hall churches usually also had thin tall columns supporting the vault. Typical examples of International Gothic architecture in the Kingdom of Bohemia are the south- Bohemian churches of St Giles in T≈ôebo≈à () and of St Vitus in Sobƒõslav (). The king himself ordered to rebuild the Italian Court in Kutn√° Hora and to build the Toƒçn√≠k Castle. Another important church was St Vitus Church in ƒåesk√Ω Krumlov built after 1407 as a hall church with a net vault in the main nave.

Many churches, monasteries and castles were burnt down and many new buildings were left unfinished by the builders, such as St Vitus Cathedral at Prague Castle. The amazing fortification system of the Hussite town T√°bor is probably the only precious architectural work of that time. During the wars and many years after them there was not enough money to build any precious buildings. The only important monuments of that time in Prague are the Church of Our Lady before T√Ωn in the Old Town of Prague (used as the main Hussite church in Bohemia) whose building continued after the wars and the higher tower of the gate of the Charles Bridge in the Lesser Town of Prague which was built at the expense of King George after 1464. = Jagiellonian Gothic = The bad situation of the Czech art caused by wars and political instability was improved after 1471 when a Catholic Polish prince Vladislaus Jagiellon (grandson of Bohemian Princess Elisabeth of Luxembourg granddaughter of Charles IV) became the new king of Bohemia and especially after 1485 when religious freedom was enacted (for Catholics and Hussites) and so the religious wars finally ended. St. Barbara's Church in Kutn√° Hora While the Renaissance style flourished in Italy and Western Europe and Hungary were under its influence, the Czech art returned in its style to the legacy of the old Gothic masters. Bohemia was not the only country which did not accept the Renaissance art very early and tried to develop the older Gothic style into new forms ‚Äì it was also the case of Austria, Bavaria, Saxony or England (see Tudor architecture). Although they still used the Gothic style, they slowly started to mix it with some Renaissance elements. The most important architect of the Czech Late Gothic style was Benedikt Rejt who worked for the King Vladislaus. He rebuilt Prague Castle in the Late Gothic style and also used some Early Renaissance elements. Rejt's masterpiece is the Vladislav Hall in the Old Royal Palace of Prague Castle which was completed in 1502, and was at its time the largest secular vaulted space (without inner supporting columns) at least in Central Europe. Benedikt Rejt completed the St. Barbara's Church in Kutn√° Hora in the Late Gothic style using a vault very similar to the vault of the Vladislav Hall. This church has a typical Late Gothic tent roof. Together with Hans Spiess Benedikt Rejt built the Royal Oratory in St. Vitus Cathedral at Prague Castle after 1490. The interesting vault of this oratory has naturalistically executed dry cut branches, tied with strong ropes at the top of arches, instead of usual ribs. Hans Spiess who came from Frankfurt am Main also rebuilt the royal K≈ôivokl√°t Castle in central Bohemia.> Another important Late Gothic architect was Matƒõj Rejsek who was of Czech origin. He built the Powder Gate in Prague in 1475‚Äì84 which was inspired by the Old Town Bridge Tower. In Brno Austrian architect Anton Pilgram was active where he designed the very interesting portal of the Old Town Hall.

His research and theoretical studies concern the city and the housing, the symbolism of spaces, the cross-border co-operation, the civil societies and the international relations, the futures studies. He is founder and president of the International University Institute of the European Studies (IUIES), co- founder and secretary general of International Futures Research Academy (IFRA). Besides he is founder and director of the following journal: FUTURIBILI (New Edition), ISIG Journal, IUIES Journal.  Biography and career  The prologue of the academic training of Alberto Gasparini was a research and the subsequent book on the history of international relations, in this case the dispute between the Church and the Dukes of Ferrara between October 1597 and January 1598. Alberto Gasparini graduated in Sociology from University of Trento (Italy) in 1969. He started working as junior and then senior researcher at the International Sociology Institute of Gorizia (ISIG) from 1970. He was lecturer and then associate professor in sociology of organizations at the University of Bologna from 1977 to 1987. In the 1983 was visiting scholar at University of Washington of Seattle. In the 1987 he became full professor of urban and rural sociology at the University of Trieste. In this University he taught also sociology of international relations and techniques of forecasting. In 1989 he was appointed director of ISIG, and then director of the Department of Human Sciences at the University of Trieste. In 1992 he started up a research doctorate (PhD) in Sociology of territorial and international phenomena, of which was coordinator. Alberto Gasparini, as director of ISIG, worked intensively on relations with scholar from, and on the problems of, the countries which emerged from the collapse of the communist system after 1989. In this regard I intensified relations with the Universities of Ljubljana, Zagreb and Belgrade, but above all have developed links with institutional counterparts in the Soviet Union (as was) and subsequently Russia and the Ukraine. Relations were thereby established with Soviet Institute of Sociology and Academy of Science, the Universities of Moscow, Leningrad (subsequently St. Petersburg), Kharkov and Tyumen. The fruit of these relations included books (such as Social actors and designing the civil society of Eastern Europe) and articles (for Futuribili and Russian journals), conferences and seminars. They also produced a macro-research project on relations among ethnic groups in Europe, including three (Italians, Friulani and Slovenes) in Friuli Venezia Giulia, three (Serbs, Hungarians and Slovaks) in the Yugoslav region of Vojvodina, four (Ukrainians, Russians, Jews and Belorussians) in the region of Kharkov, and four (Russians, Ukrainians, Caucasians and Tartars) in the Siberian region of Tyumen. In 1992 an international conference in Gorizia was attended by many scholars and teachers from universities in eastern Europe, notably Eotvos Lorand University and the University of Economic Sciences in Budapest, the Universities of Warsaw and Krak√≥w and Charles University in Prague. This was the year after the foundation of Isig Journal, which publishes articles in Italian and English on international relations, with particular reference to former communist countries and their transition processes. International relations is also the theme of an annual workshop The first was organised in 1992 on the Problems of the New Europe, held in an international Summer School. Held entirely in English, the Summer School has been a focal point for graduates, teachers and experts from all over the world. Every year it deals with fresh social, political and academic themes including Mediterranean relations, cross-border cooperation, the transition of former communist societies, innovation and creativeness, and the construction of international towns and cities. Working in University and ISIG also gave him the opportunity to resume publication of the prediction journal Futuribili. Running parallel to the English-language Futures and the French Futuribles, it was founded in 1967 by Pietro Ferraro and continued until his death in 1974. Twenty years later I restarted the journal under the ownership of ISIG and with the Angeli publishing house in Milan. Issued in Italian every four months, it deals with the prediction of social and political developments that have included the Yugoslav wars, Russia, the lives of futurologists, the concepts underpinning prediction, the future of religion and the Italy of the future. Already enhanced in the Italian context by Futuribili, prediction was further expanded by ISIG with the foundation of IFRA, the International Futures Studies Academy. The idea was developed by Igor Besthuzev-Lada (who was elected its president) and Alberto Gasparini (elected secretary-general). Based in Gorizia, IFRA has been joined by leading figures in prediction institutions from all over the world. Its function is to promote the organisation of comparative research and international meetings through telematic conferences. It has so far organised predictive research on Italy and Russia and six seminars on the state of prediction and its methods. Meanwhile, in 2000 Alberto Gasparini proposed to nine European universities (Trieste, Udine, Nova Gorica, Klagenfurt, Comenius in Bratislava, Eotvos Lorand in Budapest, Babes-Bolyai in Cluj Napoca, Jagellonica in Krak√≥w and the MGIMO in Moscow) and ISIG the idea of forming an international university consortium of European studies (IUIES) to design and organise a research doctorate (PhD) in ‚ÄúTransborder policies for daily life‚Äù and two Masters (MA) courses, one on ‚ÄúCommunication and methods of European policy making‚Äù and the other on ‚ÄúInternational Peace Operators‚Äù. The PhD lasts three years and the MA courses run for two. The students and teachers in them come from all over the world and carry out all academic activities in English. The PhD and MA qualifications are automatically recognised by all the universities in the consortium, though the degrees are actually awarded by the University of Trieste. The consortium is still operating, and Alberto Gasparini was elected its president. The experiences described above are only the most salient features of academic career of Alberto Gasparini, which has been given great impetus by his roles as director of the Department of Human Sciences at the University of Trieste, director of ISIG and president of the IUIES (International University Institute for European Studies) consortium. These roles have obviously led him to intense involvement in other work, as editor- in-chief of Isig Journal, Futuribili and Iuies Journal and on the editorial boards of other Italian and foreign journals. He has also been a member of other bodies of the University of Trieste, including the Senate. From 2007 Alberto Gasparini has been appointed a full member of the Club of Rome.  Research and theory, and some publications  The counterpoint to this work of the academic career has been the publications deriving from the research carried out and the theoretical contributions made to the subjects studied. Alberto Gasparini has written, co-authored or edited 87 books. A selection is listed below, according to the main themes. As mentioned earlier, it all began with research in the history of international relations (Cesare d‚ÄôEste e Clemente VIII, Modena, Stem 1960). This was followed by a long period devoted to the study of housing and the community: \\\\- \\"Per ben abitare\\", Gorizia, ISIG 2001; \\\\- \\"La casa ideale\\", Venice, Marsilio, 1975; \\\\- ‚ÄúInfluence of the dwelling on family life‚Äù, Ekistics, 216, 1973; \\\\- ‚ÄúCommunity and territorial belonging‚Äù, Comparative Sociology, 4, 2010; \\\\- ‚ÄúThe symbolics of the environment as related to attachment to place and community integration‚Äù, Indian Journal of Social Research, 4, 1989. Another constant theme in the research of Alberto Gasparini has been the city in relation to the symbolism of its spaces, organisations, social planning, technology and the future: \\\\- La sociologia degli spazi, Rome, Carocci 2000; \\\\- ‚ÄúSistemi urbani e futuro‚Äù (ed.), Futuribili, 1‚Äì2, 2004; \\\\- Riqualificazione e hinterland delle grandi citt√†, Milan, Angeli 1993; \\\\- Innovazione tecnologica e nuovo ordine urbano, Milan, Angeli 1991; \\\\- Il futuro della citt√†, Milan, Angeli, 1988; \\\\- Crisi della citt√† e sua reimmaginazione, Milan, Angeli 1982; \\\\- ‚ÄúThe historic center as an integration value for he outlying areas, Italy‚Äù, Ekistics, 295, 1982). In terms of rural modernisation he has published: \\\\- \\"Ambiente operativo e azienda agricola\\", Milan, Angeli 1983; \\\\- \\"Contadino, una scelta\\", Turin, Paravia 1978. The research on housing, the community, the city, modernisation, international relations and borders has all been imbued with prediction and the role of new technologies, but to the works already mentioned we can add: \\\\- ‚ÄúLa previsione. Modi e temi italiani‚Äù, Futuribili, 3, 2005; \\\\- Prediction and future studies, Encyclopedia of Sociology, New York, McMillan, 2000; \\\\- The future of the moment before. Scenarios for Russian society, torn between political, and institutional discontinuities and social continuities, Gorizia, ISIG, 1993; \\\\- ‚ÄúGerusalemme e il suo futuro, con un prologo a Roma e a Gorizia‚Äù, (ed.), Futuribili, 3, 2011). Themes such as civil society, ethnicity, peace and borders come under the umbrella of international relations, and in this regard we should mention: \\\\- Societ√† civile e relazioni internazionali, Bologna, Il Mulino, 2011; \\\\- Cross-border co-operation in Europe: A comprehensive overview, Strasburg, Council of Europe, 2012; \\\\- ‚ÄúGlobalisation, reconciliation and the conserving peace‚Äù, Global Society, 1, 2008; \\\\- Cross-border cooperation in the Balkan-Danube area.

Gulosaurus was first named by Robin S. Cuthbertson, Anthony P. Russell and Jason S. Anderson in 2013 and the type species is Gulosaurus helmi. The name means 'Helm's wolverine lizard' and refers to the Wolverine Nordic and Mountain Society, who maintain the area around Wapiti Lake where it was found, and to Dr Charles Helm, who is a leading paleontologist around this same area. Originally Gulosaurus was thought to be either Grippia longirostris or Parvinatator wapitiensis, but as the fossil was incomplete it was uncertain which. In 2013, the other half of the fossil, including its skull, was discovered and this proved it to be a new species entirely, closely related to Grippia and very similar.  Features  Overall, Gulosaurus was similar to Grippia. It was the same size, around 1.5 meters long, and much of the skeleton was the same, namely the ribs and centrum discovered. Also like Grippia, it had pentadactyl limbs rather than exhibiting polyphalangy, as many later ichthyopterygians did. Most of the flipper structure was very similar apart from the first metacarpal, which had a notched peripheral shaft in Gulosaurus but was lunate in Grippia. The skull of Gulosaurus was also very different to that of Grippia - it had cylindrical anterior teeth, although as no Grippia snouts have been discovered, it remains unknown if this was different. The skull also exhibited postfrontal-frontal contact at the rostral limit of the anterior margin of the supratemporal terrace. Phylogeny Below is a cladogram modified from Cuthbertson et al., 2013.

She had an iron-strapped wood hull with three decks, a round stern, and deck saloons. The ship was built of white oak and cedar with fastenings were copper alloy and iron, and had a copper bottom (probably Muntz Metal, 60% copper and 40% zinc, with a trace of iron). She was built under inspection and classed A-1 for insurance purposes. The engine was a vertical direct action steam engine with two cylinders with a 40-inch piston stroke. Ownership Shortly after her launch, her captain was shown as Gurdon Gates and her owners as Wakemann, Dimon & Company and S. Gildersleeve & Sons. Her homeport in 1872 was New York City and at that time she was captained by G.H. Smith and owned by Merchant Steamship Company.American Lloyd's (1872) steamers p. 34, #142 By 1880, her home port was Boston, Massachusetts, where she was owned by Alfred A. Nickerson and Frederic W.

Loss On 6 April 1881, the Boston Daily Globe carried the headline \\"Wreck of the Well-Known Steamer of the Boston and Savannah Line Off Cape Romain\\" and reported: Despite the hopes expressed above, United States was not able to be pulled off and the next day the Charleston News and Courier carried the following article titled \\"The Stranded Steamship.\\": Her permanent enrollment, which was issued at Boston on May 4, 1880, and surrendered at Boston on May 5, 1881, carries the note: \\"Vessel wrecked April 3, 1881, near Charleston, S.C.\\", while other official government records show her as \\"Lost June 30, 1881,\\" which may have been the day of her legal abandonment by her owners.\\"Off. # Book\\", (bound manuscript), Volume 37, #25082, NARS RG-41 At the time of her loss, United States was described as valued at about $60,000 and her cargo as worth about $25,000. Distribution of cargo United States had three decks. Cargo could have been stored on any of them. The ship's hold, where the majority of a ship's cargo was stored, was not normally considered a deck. Contemporary newspaper accounts specifically mention her \\"between decks cargo.\\" A \\"between deck\\" or \\"tweendeck\\" is any deck between the main deck and the ship's hold. \\"Tweendeck space\\" is the space between any two continuous decks. The mention of a between decks cargo suggests that her hold was filled to capacity, as, for weight and balance considerations, it would have been loaded first. Cargo such as bales, bags, or drums can be stacked in the tweendeck space, atop the tweendeck. Beneath the lowest deck is the hold space, used for general cargo. General cargo was packaged and crated items like jewelry, bottled medicines, wine, liquor, china, guns, mantle clocks, furniture, machinery, footwear, garments, and other merchandise. Contemporary salvage Although aground, it was initially thought United States could be saved. By the time it was realized that she couldn't be saved, she had of water in her and was \\"fast going to pieces.\\" The easily accessible \\"between deck\\" cargo, was saved in good condition. There is no record that any of the merchandise in her cargo hold, which was below water, was salvaged.

Adelante is one of the few fraternities not to adopt Greek letters. Today, Adelante is still a local fraternity and is the longest running local fraternity in the nation. History In September, 1907, six students founded a club \\"to break up a political clique that was controlling campus positions.\\" The men set up high ideals of scholarship, fellowship, leadership and adopted the Spanish word Adelante which means \\"forward.\\" The Adelante Club was later incorporated as Adelante Fraternity on November 12, 1912. Since that time it has repeatedly turned down requests to become a chapter of a national social fraternity and is today Iowa State's only unaffiliated local fraternity. The founders of Adelante are: Henry E. Haefner,Henry Haefner (1884-1978) Rex J. Davidson, Don T. Griswold, Sr., Harold F. Luick, Walter H. Leckliter and George W. Godfrey.Godfrey, George W The seeds of Adelante were sown during the 1906-07 school year at a boarding house on Lynn Avenue where the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house now stands. Several of the men who roomed there decided to stay together the next school year and rented a house on Stanton Avenue for the 1907-08 schoolyear. Here the name of Adelante was coined, and a start was made toward an organization based on present needs rather than with the thought of forming a permanent fraternity. In the beginning, the group had rather strong puritanical ideas - no drinking, smoking, and no dancing! Emphasis was placed on scholarship in those days. Social privileges (i.e. dating, and reading of novel and popular magazines during extra hours) were suspended for any members not maintaining good grades. During World War I, the Adelantes became rather inactive because only two Adelante men were living in the house at the time, (the rest of the space was occupied by the Student's Army Training Corps) although several other Adelantes were scattered throughout the campus. To keep the fires of Adelante burning, the parlor of the 304 Welch house was secured as Adelante's headquarters. During the depression years money was very tight and this affected pledging drastically. House bills had to be cut to induce men to pledge. So poor was the financial situation that it was suggested that Adelante merge with other fraternities. For various reasons, however, this idea was rejected. During World War II things were also difficult for Adelante. In the spring of 1943 all fraternities on campus agreed to move out and allow women to occupy the houses. Two members were allowed to live in the cook's room and the men were allowed to use the basement. In the fall of 1944 the men were back in the house but no meals were served for the first year of re-occupancy. From almost its beginning, Adelante had many offers to join national organizations and although for many years it considered that going national was in Adelante's best interest, declined all offers, and decided to remain a local fraternity. Adelante Today The current House was constructed in 1972 and has a thirty-two member capacity. Its rooms are based on a suite system where two members share a common living area with individual wardrobes and desks. They further share a private bathroom and sleeping room, with another two members who live in another room on the other side of the suite. Because of this unique room setup, we can have air-conditioning and heating in all parts of the house; most other fraternities must have open air sleeping dorms. The Adelante house additionally has several large common areas, shared by all members of the fraternity. These include a second floor lounge and study area, a large living room with a fireplace, and a fully stocked kitchen and dining room. In order to maintain the high living standards of Adelante, regular renovation projects are taken on a yearly basis. Recent remodeling includes a new dining room, renovated second floor living areas, and remodeling of some of the suites. Adelante is located two blocks from campus, on Welch Avenue, in the heart of Campus Town. Because of the varied restaurants, businesses, and stores nearby, you can usually find everything you need within walking distance. And for the occasions where travelling is a necessity, all Adelante members enjoy the luxury of on-site parking.

It was opened in 1996 originally in the former church of the San Pedro y San Pablo College. However, this building was closed in 2010 in order to convert it into the Museum of the Constitutions. The Museum of Light was moved to its current and larger location, but it remains an extension of the Universum museum, the general science museum of the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico. Museum The Museum of Light is located in the ‚ÄúColegio Chico‚Äù portion of the former San Ildefonso College. It operates as an extension of the Universum museum, the general science museum of the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico. The museum occupies two floors of the building, with most of the rooms dedicated to permanent exhibits and two others for temporary exhibits and shows. The museum explores the different facets of light phenomenon and its relationships to various sciences. There are six major permanent exhibits along with an area to hold workshops. The Nature of Light exhibition explores the basic principles of light with exhibits that demonstrate its physics, the working of mirrors, the electromagnetic spectrum and a darkroom. The Light of the Stars exhibit focuses on the chemistry and other aspects of these celestial bodies and how they are discovered through the light they emit. A World of Colors focuses how colors are generated and perceived as well as how they are taken advantage of in nature. Light in the Arts reflects on how light, the illusion of light and color are used in this field. Light and the Biosphere focuses on how light is important to life, with photosynthesis as the basis for the food chain. The last section is called Vision, which focuses on how eyes work. History The museum was opened in 1996, originally in the former church of the San Pedro y San Pablo College, one block from the current location. This church building was renovated in the mid 1990s for the purpose of the museum after being abandoned for twenty years prior. The idea for the museum was the brainchild of Jorge Flores along with Ana Mar√≠a Cetto and Luis de la Pe√±a, initiated the idea of creating a museum dedicated to electromagnetic radiation, commonly known as light. In 2010, the decision was made to close the Museum of Light in that location and replace it with a museum dedicated to the various constitutions that Mexico has had since its independence as part of Mexico‚Äôs Bicentennial of Independence and Centennial of the Revolution. The building was closed in February of that year, and the Museo de las Constitutiones was opened in 2011. After closure, the future of the museum of light was in doubt. One proposal was to merge it into the Universum facility, but this was rejected due to fears that the museum would disappear completely. Instead, in late 2010, the decision was made to move the museum to another building in the historic center of Mexico City also owned by UNAM, the San Ildefonso College. The new space is larger than the old and the museum reopened in 2011.

She received rave reviews regarding her stage presence. However, her performance was criticised for being \\"sexualised\\".

Some also took to Twitter to claim that this proved Rihanna is not a good role model for children. However, Asanda's father Lennox insisted that his daughter is \\"mature for her age\\": stating, \\"I know she is young but, believe me, she's ready ... We know there will always be negative as well as positive comments. We don't want her to get hurt so we've prepared her.

The GNoSR took over services on 1 February 1863, and the railway renamed the Banffshire Railway. An extension to Portgordon was authorised, but this was abandoned in 1867 and the Banffshire absorbed by the GNoSR. The line to Portgordon was later revived and extended along the Moray Firth coast to Elgin, and this opened on 1 May 1886. A curve was opened at the junction to allow Aberdeen trains direct access to the Coast Line without reversing at the station. In 1923 the Great North of Scotland Railway was absorbed by the London and North Eastern Railway. This was nationalised in 1948, and services provided by British Railways. The stopping services on the Aberdeen to Inverness Line were recommended to be withdrawn in Dr Beeching's report \\"The Reshaping of British Railways\\", and the station closed on 6 May 1968. Services Initially there were five services a day between Aberdeen and Keith, although this was later reduced to four. After the GNoSR took over branch services there were three trains a day to Banff. In summer 1948 Grange was served by eight trains to and from Aberdeen, with Grange about to 2 hours from Aberdeen. A complex system of train portion working towards Inverness gave a service of 4 trains a day over the direct route via Mulben, three via Craigellachie (four on Sundays) and four via the Coast line. There were no Sunday services.
